0,MartinHafer,"Not a 'fun' movie, and it is a bit slow, but still a rather remarkable film.",7,12 November 2021,"""Brokeback Mountain"" is a very low energy film that made a big hubbub when it debuted due to its gay characters....something Hollywood hadn't previously done in western films, apart from parodies like ""Lust in the Dust"". As a result, a lot of folks adored the film and lauded it for its bravery. As for me, I liked the movie but I wasn't as impressed by it as some...mostly because the relationship between Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis (Heath Ledger) seemed to move too quickly at first...way too fast and not especially realistic.The story begins with the two ranch hands, Ennis and Jack, spending the summer way up in the Wyoming mountains with a huge flock of sheep. They are alone and eventually the pair have sex...though as I mentioned above, the build up to this seems too quick. I wish they'd showed a more natural and believable transition from co-workers to lovers.This portion of the film is relatively brief and after this summer the two go separate ways...Jack to Texas where he eventually marries and has a family and Ennis to Wyoming where he does the same. And, because this story takes place from the 1960s to the 80s, the pair live the straight lives and only meet on occasion when they go back to Brokeback Mountain for their trysts. What's next? See the film.Heath Ledger got a lot of publicity about his performance and I was surprised at his accent and flat affect which worked well with the character. He also was rather low energy and combined with the very slow pacing of the film might make this movie less approachable to most viewers...not just because of the gay plot. As for me, I would like to have seen more emotion and more of the film focused on Ennis and Jack...and a slightly faster pace. Still, it is a very good film and well worth seeing.",Brokeback Mountain
1,TheLittleSongbird,Mesmerising,10,2 December 2010,"I was completely mesmerised by Brokeback Mountain. It is such a beautiful and poignant film, that also benefits from being gorgeously shot and adeptly acted and directed. The film does move slowly of course, but I personally think that Brokeback Mountain was deliberately paced like that(I said very similar things about 2001 and The Godfather too, they are constantly criticised for being boring yet both had their reasons for being paced like that). The slow pacing allowed us to empathise with the characters more, and that paid off, because the characterisations are superb. As are the beautifully written and thought-provoking screenplay and gentle scoring. Ang Lee's direction is the best it's been here I feel, while the cinematography and scenery are simply breathtaking. The acting is excellent. Heath Ledger I think gives his best performance here(sorry Dark Knight fans, I loved him there, but he was beyond amazing here), while Jake Gyllanhaal is very believable, and Michelle Williams is heart-wrenching. Also Brokeback Mountain is quite emotionally affecting, it really makes you think and the sheer beauty of the visuals, acting and story are enough to make me cry, and I was in pieces after the ending. In conclusion, a mesmerising film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Brokeback Mountain
2,bkoganbing,A Working Class Gay Love Story,10,6 January 2006,"Having just come from the premiere showing of Brokeback Mountain in my city, the thing that struck me is that it is a working class story. Strip away all the glamour and mystique about being a cowboy and we are talking about two knock around working class men in Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Ledger and Gyllenhaal could have been steelworkers, auto workers, plumbers, even sanitation men. Technically speaking they're not even cowboys, they're sheepherders. That's how they meet, Randy Quaid hires them to watch his sheep which are grazing on government land on Brokeback Mountain. They certainly aren't in professions that are dominated by gays.The story is that on that mountain, the gay urge in both of them comes out and they begin an over 20 year relationship from that summer on Brokeback. This however is 1963, six years before Stonewall, and a generation before any open gay life comes to the state of Wyoming. It's still a dangerous place Wyoming as the ghost of Matthew Shepard would so testify.So Ennis Delmar and Jack Twist are forced for the sake of convention to lead false lives. Both marry and have children, and both even love their families. But the romance is reserved for each other.Brokeback Mountain for today's audience speaks to whole generations of Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual/Transgendered people for whom living an open life was not an option. I hope a lot of the young people see it and realize how hard it was for their elders to be as open as so many more gay folk are.The film also speaks to what it is still like for many GLBT people in a rural setting. Even back in 1963 Ennis and Jack had they lived in a large city, might have found a community with some kind of support. Their aloneness is the real heart of Brokeback Mountain.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal deliver some Oscar calibre performances here. Given the normal tradition of the Academy if they both receive Best Actor nominations, they might just split the vote and neither will get it. Brokeback Mountain will no doubt take some awards away at this year's Oscar ceremonies in any event. Hopefully for the producers who had the courage to bring this story to the screen.Maybe someone should be searching now for a property concerning two women and also transgendered people and what aloneness they felt in generations past.",Brokeback Mountain
3,SnoopyStyle,Great acting from the boys and Williams,7,26 January 2015,"It's 1963. Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) hitchhikes and stops at Signal, Wyoming. He and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) get hired as sheep herders on the side of Brokeback Mountain. One cold night, they have a homosexual encounter. They insist that they're not queer but they continue anyways. Their boss Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) notices their relationship and doesn't hire the guys the next season. Ennis marries Alma (Michelle Williams) and they have a young family together. Jack goes back to the rodeo circuit and has a family with barrel racer Lureen Newsome (Anne Hathaway). Both find married life deficient and reconnects. They just can't quit each other.The story is a bit slow and uncomfortable. The most compelling aspect is that being gay isn't the usual flamboyant over-the-top act. They are hidden and fear of discovery is palpable. There is one great scene from Michelle Williams. She does some superb acting. The boys risk a lot in these scary roles. Ledger's speaking style does get a bit muffled at times. However his acting is great and his fears are written all over his face. The superior acting and the risky subject makes this a worthwhile watch.",Brokeback Mountain
4,Hitchcoc,So Touching and So Very Sad,10,2 May 2019,"This is a film that brought some things into the mainstream. To have two very masculine characters portrayed in a sensitive way as they profess their love for each other was a major event in cinema and in culture. I know there will be naysayers, but I felt this was one of the most poignant films ever produced. It is rife with sadness and pain. The two men must go through contortions to maintain their relationship. And there is a great tragedy here.",Brokeback Mountain
5,Horst_In_Translation,Close to perfection for the most part,8,22 January 2018,"""Brokeback Mountain"" is an American movie mostly in the English language and this one was released back in 2005 when it dominated large parts of the awards season. I don't want to go into detail now if I think that it deserved the Best Picture Oscar more than Crash or not, but I believe both are extraordinary films really, so it was a win-win situation and Munich, another nominee, is at least as good. But back to this one here. It won Oscars though for its direction (gotta love Ang Lee), its music and its screenplay and I had the chance to watch Brokeback Mountain on the big screen last night again on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of Heath Ledger's death. A sad tribute this is. The film runs for 2 hours 15 minutes, so very long, but it never drags one bit I must say. A lot of that has to do with the previously mentioned Ledger, who gives one of the best performances of the decade and what a year for Best Actor this was with the winner now also dead way too early. Anyway, Ledger is really hitting all the right notes here from start to finish in a truly masterful performance. His co-lead Jake Gyllenhaal (obviously not supporting) has 2 or 3 misses in it I would say and that may be the reason why he ""only"" won the BAFTA and came short at the Oscars in a year that had a wide open race for Best Supporting Actor. Also in it are Michelle Williams, another nominee, and Anne Hathaway as well as a few others. The two ladies I just mentioned also have great moments. For Hathaway, that would be the phone scene at the very end of course and for Williams, there are several like for example the fishing rod note scene or also the scene when she sees the two men kissing outside the house. There is that moment when she begs her husband to get her some cigarettes just to have him do something for her, but there is no way he would do anything when going out with his lover and it becomes painfully obvious for Williams' character, not that she cared about the cigarettes or anything. This was just a tiny moment, but these tiny moments are what makes the film so great because there is so so much attention to detail in this one that it is simply a joy to watch. You will recognize these moments yourself whenever you see the film (again). And it certainly is an irony that so far Hathaway is the only one who managed to win an Oscar in her lifetime from the cast here, the only one from the 4 romantic key players not nominated for BBM.I think with the huge quantity of gay-themed movies out there these days that all of these filmmakers can learn so much from Lee here. The key to the film's success is that the movie almost never relied one bit on the fact that it was a relationship between two men. There is the scene with the flashback to Ledger's character's youth, but that is one of very few exceptions, even if it becomes crucial near the very end again when we wonder together with Ledger's character to what extent Gyllenhaal's character's death may have been dubious or really just an accident. We only know what he knows and that is true for almost the entire film. We find out about the death the moment he does when the letter comes back. We find out what happens during the phone call near the very end. And admittedly this death was so abrupt and I really liked it. This can happen absolutely out of nowhere and this film should inspire us to cherish our loved ones or to get active in winning over our future loved ones with the little time we are given to do so. Just like Ledger's character did not take the risk to live with another man together on a ranch for decades and he cannot turn back time when it is all over. And there certainly is some tragedy to the fact that Gyllenhaal's character died the way he died working for his wife and would not have when he had lived with his great love. And then there is some great emotion in this one like the ashes scene at the very end or Ledger's character crying during their last meeting. Here and there, there is also some situational comedy like the talking (or lack thereof) by Ledger's character. On a side note, you will find familiar faces here and there and I really did not remember Kate Mara to be a part of this. Or David Harbour from Stranger Things. Or Anna Faris. Quite a few surprises. This is a really amazing movie, close to perfection technically and extremely elevated by the mesmerizing lead performance, the really convincing script and Ang Lee's vision. I very much enjoy Joaquin Phoneix in Walk the Line as I am a huge Johnny Cash fan, but even I find it difficult to argue against Ledger's turn in here being top of the pile from 2005. What else can I say? If you still have not seen this movie yet, then you really really really need to change that. This was the second or third time I watched it as a whole, first time on the big screen and it is still so rewarding to watch this one. It all feels so real, never just as if the film or certain scenes only existed to make a political statement pro tolerance and pro homosexuality. It's all about the story and the message comes from itself, but it's not like the film exists only for the message and has nothing else to offer, which is so frequently a problem with gay-themed (ugh I hate the term) movies. This one here's an absolute thing of beauty, without a doubt one of 2005's very finest and I highly recommend checking it out.",Brokeback Mountain
6,claudio_carvalho,John Wayne is Probably Trembling In His Grave,6,17 August 2006,"In 1963, in Wyoming, the rancher Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and the rodeo cowboy Jack Twist (Jake Gynllenhaal) are hired to watch the sheep along the summer in the Brokeback Mountain. In a cold night, the get drunken and have sexual intercourse after months of loneliness. When their assignment ends, Jack moves to Texas and Ennis to Riverton and they raise families of their own. Years later, when they meet each other, a passionate bond connects them and they fall in love for each other. They affair lasts for more than twelve years when a tragedy happens.""Brokeback Mountain"" is a dramatic romance, with great and brave performances of Heath Ledger and Jake Gynllenhaal and magnificent landscapes. However, the story about the forbidden and repressed love between two cowboys is not for all tastes including mine and this movie is overrated. The characters do not assume their relationship and betray their wives and families, and their gay thing is despicable, since both are in lust, not in love for each other. Further, I was raised watching western movies with tough cowboys like John Wayne, and this image is very difficult for me to be dissociated. Ang Lee seems to want to impact this ""Malboro"" image. Last but not the least, the career of the Chinese director Ang Lee needs to return to his origins: after the terrible ""Hulk"", directing a movie with cowboys-gay is quite surrealistic. Surprisingly many people liked it. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""O Segredo de Brokeback Mountain"" (""The Secret of Brokeback Mountain"")",Brokeback Mountain
7,kosmasp,More than that,8,24 April 2007,"This movie is not about gay cowboys. Yes the main characters (cowboys) depicted in this movie are gay, but that's not the point. It's about a love that is suppressed, by the community, by family but most of all by themselves too. Heath Ledger's character is pretty uncomfortably with his lover.Which of course has to do with the story, that the parents reveal to Gyllenhall's character at the end. And Ang Lee knows how to capture all that. He had a little experience beforehand, when he did one cowboy movie (Ride with the Devil or something like that, you can look it up here at IMDb).And although he doesn't show explicitly what the two cowboys do together (and I thank him for not doing so, I wouldn't want to watch that), the movie stirred up big discussions around the world ... and even when people rent this movie at a video club/store, they (guys) always say that it's for someone else, they wouldn't watch that! Yes it is difficult to watch men even being in love with each other, when you're straight (I know what I'm talking about here), but if you can see beyond that fact, you will see a wonderful movie, that deserves to be seen!",Brokeback Mountain
8,classicsoncall,"""It ain't nobody's business but ours.""",8,1 February 2006,"Somewhere between it's Golden Globes win as Best Picture, and my sister's dismissal of the film as boring, lies the reputation of ""Brokeback Mountain"" as a film of significance. Prepared for either eventuality, I found the movie to have handled it's subject rather well, without being overtly or gratuitously graphic. As to it's greatness, that will be left to the test of time.The performances by the leads, as well as the supporting cast was realistic and engaging, lending credibility to the story. Director Ang Lee never ceases to amaze, with films as diametrically opposed as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""Hulk"", and now ""Brokeback Mountain. Where does the creative vision for handling such themes come from?I can't say for sure if handling Jack's death within the story might have carried more force though, as opposed to it being dealt with in almost a flashback sort of way. Still tragic of course, but to my thinking, it would have guaranteed a more dramatic impact if done as part of the story in real time.Curiosity about the film prompted me to go see it; having done so I can say it was a worthwhile experience. It's good to see a controversial subject handled maturely and with creativity. Now let's see what Oscar says.",Brokeback Mountain
9,gavin6942,One Love Story to Rule Them All,10,13 March 2006,"As Senator Russ Feingold said, this film is tremendous and tragic. I heard all the hype for months and wasn't really expecting much (I'm not much for hype), but now that I've seen it, I'm converted. This might be the greatest love story ever told (or at least ranks very high, with ""The Princess Bride"", ""A Walk to Remember"" and others).The story is fairly simple: two ranchers meet while working at the same ranch and develop a strong attraction for each other. At the end of the job, they go their own ways and go on to have wives and kids. But the feelings won't stop, and they will travel great distances to be together.Roger Ebert hit the nail on the head about the secret of this film's greatness: our own forbidden love. We can identify with being in love with someone society doesn't want us to be. Different gender, religion, age (this also makes ""Lolita"" great), race... the list goes on. We haven't all had a forbidden love, but I believe most of us have a deep sense of the power of love and we think that love is the one thing worth overcoming obstacles for. Or maybe I'm just a hopeless romantic.Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger were both great in this. Ledger really shows his acting limits here, becoming a whole new person. But the real gems are Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams. Hathaway, known from ""Princess Diaries"" and ""Ella Enchanted"" (both of which I've seen for some reason) takes a surprisingly adult turn here. Not unlike how Jennifer Connelly went from ""Labrynth"" to ""Requiem for a Dream"". Michelle Williams also makes a more adult turn. I never cared for her from ""Dawson's Creek"", but I think her character is the most powerful in this story. Her role as both obstacle and victim is very intense.You really should see this movie. All men, women and children should see this movie. The only excuse you have not to see it is if you're a raging homophobe, but if you are you're probably not capable of fully understanding love anyway. Highest possible human recommendation.",Brokeback Mountain
10,lee_eisenberg,I cannot stress how good this movie is.,10,2 January 2006,"Watching ""Brokeback Mountain"", it's amazing that anyone told Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal that it would be a career killer. Clearly, it has had just the opposite effect. The two actors play Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, respectively, who meet while herding sheep in Wyoming. As time passes, they become attracted to each other, and it starts affecting their personal lives.Like I said, I cannot stress how great this movie is. Aside from the fact that Ledger and Gyllenhaal play their roles perfectly and with top-notch intensity, Ledger really looks like he's aging (not only going gray, but also looking leathery).All in all, Ang Lee has created a masterpiece along the lines of ""Citizen Kane"", ""Dr. Strangelove"", ""The Godfather"", and ""Schindler's List"". I wish to assert that not only does ""Brokeback Mountain"" deserve Best Picture, but everyone involved in it deserves an Oscar. Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams play roles equally as great as the two male leads (Randy Quaid also stars). A perfect movie in every way.",Brokeback Mountain
11,jboothmillard,Brokeback Mountain,8,11 December 2006,"From Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated director Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), this film was a good boost to his career. Basically, it is 1963, and the story of two men, rancher Ennis Del Mar (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Heath Ledger) and rodeo cowboy Jack Twist (BAFTA winning, and Oscar nominated Jake Gyllenhaal) hired to watch sheep along the summer for Joe Aguirre (Independence Day's Randy Quaid). As they spend more and more time together at Brokeback, they become good friends, and they find that they are becoming very close, and eventually realise that they love each other, but neither of them are gay. It is only when returning to their ordinary lives that they realise how much they really want each other. Over the many years they only see each other at Brokeback every few months, and both have to try and bare it. The film has rather a tearful ending when Ennis is sent a card saying Jack is deceased (he was beaten to death for being queer), and Ennis goes to Jack's parents' house to show his remorse, and take a memento. Also starring Linda Cardellini as Cassie, Scary Movie's Anna Faris as Lashawn Malone, Anne Hathaway as Lureen Newsome and Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Michelle Williams as Alma. It won the Oscars for Best Music, Original Score for Gustavo Santaolalla, and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, and Best Motion Picture of the Year, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Adapted Screenplay, and the David Lean Award for Direction, and it was nominated the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Cinematography, and Best Editing, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Song for ""A Love That Will Never Grow Old"", and Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for Best Original Score. Very good!",Brokeback Mountain
12,moonspinner55,An emotional powerhouse...,9,7 May 2006,"Intensely moving drama from director Ang Lee, based on a short story by E. Annie Proulx (a surprising source for such a theme), about two disparate cowboys in 1963 Wyoming who take sheepherding job through isolated, rocky terrain; they form an almost begrudging bond that formulates itself into a sexual longing, one that both men find hard to shake off once their work is finished. Despite a tableaux-movie feel, featuring shots of dramatic cloudy skies and beautiful moonlit nights, the film isn't top-heavy with prestige. It carefully builds such an emotional resonance in its early stages that the characters become quite real, compelling and complex. It turns out the film isn't so much a ""gay cowboy movie"" as it is a strong, absorbing picture about human need and desire, which in this case comes across as quite natural: these two men really do belong together, their closeness seems entirely right, but the times and their surroundings do not permit this. It's a heartbreaker, written, directed and acted with genuine beauty and grace. ***1/2 from ****",Brokeback Mountain
13,Quinoa1984,"turns out to be a touching story without forcing it; good direction, perfectly subdued performances",9,6 January 2006,"Ang Lee is brilliant, for the most part, at controlling the mood of scenes. Some might think its detached, but it really isn't. By building up the story, and then letting the conflict build under the seams, when it comes time for the conflict to come to a head, it really does become touching. That's because Brokeback Mountain, putting aside all of the media's hoopla about it, works best because of Lee's trust in the great screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, and a few very good performances. To say that the film might be a tad overlong in a couple of spots (maybe it might drag to some, maybe not, the pace picks up where need be) is not a harsh criticism, just an observation. Because aside from that, I couldn't really find much fault in the film. Aside from the 'issue' that's been created that it's a 'gay cowboy movie' (more like a modern gay western, ala out of the Sundance channel gone Hollywood), it's best at being a naturalistic drama.Lee's eye for vistas and the environments around these characters is fascinating, but that for me wasn't what drew me into the film. What drew me in, and what does draw me into good movies, is the script. McMurtry (a seasoned veteran of dozens of novels set in the west involving sometimes awkward states of reality) and Ossana make the story be all the more real by its structure, and how the dialog goes for the characters. There is barely a false note within the wording of the scenes, even trickier ones to handle like the few, forceful arguments between the characters. And when the climax comes, which will be an emotional one for many (I was even moved, mostly by the subtlety and lack of hope), it doesn't feel compromised like something out of a TV movie. That it's taken from a 50 page short story and turned into a 2+ hour film is quite an achievement. Come Oscar time, it should be them to get a sure-fire nomination, among the other obvious ones (and like the film or not, it's getting its noms).Heath Ledger, in fact, is more of the central character of this film, as his Ennis meets Jack Twist (Jake Ghylenhaal) while sheep herding in 1963 out on the mountain of the title. One thing leads to another, and then over the course of almost twenty years they see each other on and off to go 'fishing' even as they get married elsewhere and have kids. Each actor, be it the two main males or their wives (Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway, both very good in un-characteristic performances), play it just as it is in the script. Ledger, despite not always being the most clear-spoken actor (if you might not understand a few sentences it's just the way he speaks), gives one of the best performances of his career thus far. The subtlety he displays at times, the innate tendency of his character to hold back, is sometimes staggering. And Ghyllenhaal deserves some equal praise, even as his character isn't nearly as fleshed out or dimensional as the counterpart.Did I think Brokeback Mountain was a groundbreaking masterpiece. No, probably not. The same issues dealt with in this film have also been dealt with in at least a dozen other films, however more in the independent film world, sometimes even better. And Lee, while talented, isn't my favorite sort of director for these kinds of love stories. But it is a film that grabs your attention, that doesn't hit you over the head with out-right 'messages', and just shows these characters fates as so, over a lifespan that goes on as secret love goes on in the shadows of the mountain. It's well-done, even if it isn't one of my favorite films of the year. A-",Brokeback Mountain
14,edwagreen,"""Brokeback Mountain"" When the Marlboro Man Goes Gay ***",7,7 April 2006,"Heath Ledger, in the lead role, takes on the character that would have been ideal for Paul Newman had Hollywood been allowed to make such a film years ago.Ledger is definitely the new Paul Newman. In many ways, he reminded me of the great star's performance in ""Hud."" Even the way he wore his cowboy hat was similar to that of Newman.The first part of the movie will be viewed by many as objectionable. It details how the 2 shepherds fall into a homosexual relationship which becomes a ""Same Time, Next Year"" thing. The difference is that in the latter film, the couple could go on with their everyday lives. This picture depicts how their relationship, which was destined to go nowhere, ultimately ruins their lives.Ledger, in a low-voiced keyed performance, is terrific as the surviving partner of a relationship that ruined his marriage and leaves him alone at film's end. Jake Gylenhaal is wonderful as his counterpart. Strong-willed but realistic, he set an appropriate tone by his acting.""Brokeback Mountain"" was the surprise Oscar loser for best picture. Even liberal Hollywood could not find itself in the end to vote for a homosexual based film. Instead, they chose the rather ""safe"" film ""Crash,"" which detailed racist problems in society.

15,wes-connors,Gone Fishing,10,23 May 2009,"Seeking summer employment, Wyoming ranch hand Heath Ledger (as Ennis Del Mar) and Texas rodeo cowboy Jake Gyllenhaal (as Jack Twist) get a job minding Randy Quaid's sheep up on ""Brokeback Mountain"" - and the rest, like they say, is history The official synopsis accurately describes this film as ""a sweeping epic that explores the lives of two young men...who meet in the summer of 1963 and unexpectedly forge a lifelong connection. The complications, joys, and heartbreak they experience provide a testament to the endurance and power of love."" The film is about individual relationships, and features a level and range of human sexual relationships not acceptable in ""mainstream"" movies at the time of its release.The story, by Annie Proulx with Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana lives up to its reputation as flawless. The western landscape is spectacular, with cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto's camera coming alive under Ang Lee's direction. Mr. Lee's direction, and Gustavo Santaolalla's musical score, keep the photography and performances in tune. Lee makes the camera an important character adjunct - note how the camera flirts with Mr. Ledger and Mr. Gyllenhaal, when they first arrive on the scene; Gyllenhaal poses by his truck, and glimpses at Ledger while he shaves. Bisexual and lonely, Gyllenhaal knows what he wants, but Ledger is an emotional wreck. From there, we witness their falling in (isolated) love, on ""Brokeback Mountain"". These are (or, were, at the time) the film's most iconic scenes; but, the film gets better and better, as Ledger and Gyllenhaal lead necessarily separate lives, but strengthen their emotional love.Their final scenes together, and Ledger visiting Gyllenhaal's parents, are truly amazing cinematic achievements; making ""Brokeback Mountain"" not only the ""Best Picture"" of the year, but also an ""all-time"" great film. Ledger's trip to Gyllenhaal's boyhood bedroom matches the emotional depths present in ""silent"" movie scenes; Lee knows not only when to use dialogue, but also when it's superfluous. Ledger and Gyllenhaal easily earn their many ""Best Actor"" and ""Best Supporting Actor"" honors; the latter's regulation as a ""Supporting Actor"" is probably due to having less screen time - but, if Ledger's performance had been ordinary, ""Oscar"" (and some others) could have nominated Gyllenhaal for the lead actor award.The cast is uniformly perfect, right down to the smallest role. Probably, the ""Best Supporting Actress"" would have to be Michelle Williams (as Alma Beers), again, due to screen time. But, Anne Hathaway (as Lureen Newsome) is excellent, as well; and, Linda Cardellini (as Cassie Cartwright) turns her sexy secondary role into screen gold (she's the one who tells Ledger, ""Girls don't fall in love with fun""). Characters on screen for only moments resonate - witness Roberta Maxwell's understanding looks and Peter McRobbie icy stares (they play Gyllenhaal's parents). ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a production where story and execution merge perfectly. Lee, his cast, and crew are at peak levels of artistic achievement. And, the positive effect this film had upon society is both arguable and incalculable. Make sure you see it.********** Brokeback Mountain (9/2/05) Ang Lee ~ Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway",Brokeback Mountain
16,sunwarrior13,An Unfulfilled Love Story,10,13 October 2011,"Brokeback Mountain was classified as a gay cowboy movie.But it is more than that.It tells a story about two people who feels love for one another and a passion that will never be felt by ordinary people.Unfortunately the lovers in the movie are both gay.The film is actually a romantic drama that is an adaptation of the short story of the same name by Annie Proulx.The screenplay was written by Diana Ossana and Larry McMurtry. It stars Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams.It was directed by Ang Lee.Jack and Ennis met at a job tending sheep at Brokeback Mountain one summer and felt one day that they are very much in love with one another.Unfortunately,the year was 1963 and society was less open to acceptance of gay relationships.So after the experience they had,Jack and Ennis moved on to continuing their SECRET relationship despite of getting married and having children in the years to come.Brokeback Mountain explores a relationship that is not meant to be considering its implications to society and the complexities brought about by their relationship to their families.It moved me in the sense that their is a forbidden love whose passion maybe comparable only to that of William Shakespeare's characters - Romeo and Juliet.There is sadness and anxiety to it.Also,there is a feeling of involvement considering how limited it can be.The movie has won four well-deserved Golden Globes including Best Picture.Ang Lee definitely has superb direction as the movie's story unfolds that we feel sympathy to the characters involved especially Ennis and Jack.Also,Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are great as Ennis and Jack respectively .Heath Ledger definitely was the star of this film as he was able to bring complexity to Ennis' character.His Golden Globe nomination is well deserved.This is the best movie of the year and I hope that it wins the Best Picture award at the Oscars.",Brokeback Mountain

As it hit cinemas and more and more people saw it people on the other end of the political spectrum started to lavish praise on it and used adjectives like "" Groundbreaking "" "" courageous "" "" A masterwork "" and "" revolutionary film making "" and started to pick up every film award until the Oscars where the Oscar for best film went to CRASH which had a great number of critics and commentators screaming that this was the greatest travesty in Academy Award history . After finally getting to see both movies I have to say BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN didn't deserve many of the film awards it did receive never mind the ones it didn't I have to say this is highly manipulative film making . I don't have a problem with its theme of two macho cowboys falling in love with each other but I do have a problem of the way they suddenly just find themselves falling into a sexual relationship . Is this a common occurrence in real life where people suddenly enter a same sex relationship because it seemed like a good idea at the time ? The whole set up seemed far too sudden to be credible to me but I guess if you're ultra liberal you'll just have to go along with it same as when their relationship is established you have to empathize with the characters of Del Mar and Twist instead of other characters . I guess their employer is in the wrong because he's concerned about the livestock and doesn't like what these two cowboys are getting up to during work hours or that there's something wrong with Alma when she finds out her husband is gay and is disgusted and shattered by this ? Hey you don't want anyone to accuse you of being a homophobic reactionary after all do you ? Are we to take the side of Del Mar and Twist simply because they are gay ? I think if the story had been slightly reconstructed so we see it from Alma's POV this would have been a far better movie since she's by far the most sympathetic character in the movie If that had been the case then we'd certainly have had a more dramatic movie since we'd get scenes of Alma throwing things around the kitchen screaming "" WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME YOU WERE A... A .... YOU MADE LOVE TO ME AND YOU NEVER ONCE TOLD ME YOU WERE A... A... I,M SO DISGUSTED I CAN'T EVEN SAY THAT WORD "" because if there's one thing lacking in much of this movie it's drama . Instead of heart wrenching drama we're subjected to a couple of gay cowboys mumbling stuff which is difficult to hear because the sound mix is so bad and Ang Lee hasn't done his cause much good because there's a distinct lack of cross cuts which makes some scenes in particular and the film in general feel far longer than the just over two hours running length . This film feels far far longer than it really is and is often an ordeal to sit through There are some plus points . Certainly the cinematography is excellent and the beautiful isolated landscape is captured so well I almost felt like rushing off to visit Wyoming if it hadn't left me with the impression that it's over run with gay cowboys , violent rednecks , trailer trash and sheep . And despite my criticism about the lack of incident or drama the ending is genuinely sad , certainly not as sad as many of the more liberal commentators have suggested but sad enough to give BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN a higher mark out of ten than I genuinely feel it deserves",Brokeback Mountain
19,jotix100,Loving cowboys,10,9 December 2005,"Annie Proulx brilliant short story was only eleven pages long, but it felt as though it was a full novel. This was a short story that demanded to be seen as a full length movie, which with the help of its director, Ang Lee, and the glorious screen play by Larry McMurtry, and Diana Ossana, who went to produce the film, is a triumph for all involved in it for the frankness and understanding they brought to it. There are changes in the story, one guesses to fit the cinematic treatment.""Brokeback Mountain"" is basically about love and not about sex, as one might have been led to believe. In fact, the subject has been treated with the utmost good taste as the director doesn't want to expose more than he has to. Ennis Del Mar and Jack Swift find one another and they have no problem in what they embark to. When the end of their herding days end, they walk away from each other without any promises of keeping in touch or meeting again.When Ennis and Jack see each other after four years, it's clear the feelings they have for one another have been bottled in their souls. Not even Alma Del Mar, who has seen them in a compromising way, can separate them. Alma realizes she can't get between Ennis and Jack. It's clear they share a passion that she, or Lureen, Jack's wife cannot pull them apart. Even though this is something that is not meant to be, both men can't let go of one another, even if it's only meant to happen a couple of times a year.Heath Ledger comes out better in his take of Ennis. His sensitive approach to the role shows a young actor giving an excellent performance and in total control of his craft. Jake Gyllenhaal, with his dark looks is also wonderful as Jack Twist.The film shows a good director getting the best out of his team. The atmospheric music by Gustavo Santaolalla blends itself well with the story. The Canadian Rockies are magnificently photographed by Rodrigo Prieto who has given the film an elegant and regal look.Ultimately, the film belongs to Ang Lee who has a keen eye for making this story appealing.",Brokeback Mountain
20,Doylenf,The bittersweet final scenes are enough to melt the heart...,8,4 April 2006,"I held it all together until that final scene where HEATH LEDGER goes to the farmhouse to see Jack's parents. And then, on top of that, the last jacket scene where his eyes well up with tears--well, at that point the story really got to me and I wept with him.It touches anyone who has been in and out of love--and it's a universal theme that's explored here--and explored so brilliantly.Ang Lee has directed with a sure touch throughout, leading to that final devastatingly emotional--and yet understated scene that ties up the whole story. HEATH LEDGER, with his stealthy glances and shy, twisted smile and grimaces, reminds me of the young and still raw STERLING HAYDEN in his first early Technicolor film. But unlike Hayden, who had not yet learned to act, Ledger gives his all to a complex role that fits him like a glove. No less fascinating is JAKE GYLLENHAAL as the more open and natural man who longs for a lifelong friendship without all the separations that their marriages bring.And finally, Heath's character, Ennis del Mar, is left with nothing but his friend's shirt and jacket worn on Brokeback Mountain--and the bittersweet memory of what might have been a more fulfilling relationship all that time but one that would have made them outlaws in the world they inhabited.The female roles are more peripheral but all are extremely well played, especially by Michelle Williams. The music is non-obtrusive, always reflecting mood and character and the sumptuous outdoor settings are photographed with great skill.A very rewarding film that is much more than just ""a gay cowboy movie."" It's an enriching experience--and one that will make you think and ponder--especially all of those who may have been on this road before.",Brokeback Mountain
21,preppy-3,I was bored,1,24 December 2005,"In 1963 Wyoming two cowboys (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal) are watching over sheep on a remote mountain--Brokeback Mountain. They grow to know and understand each other--and have sex one cold night. The affair continues until they have to leave. Ledger marries (Michelle Williams) and so does Gyllenhaal (Anne Hathaway). After 4 years apart they get together again...and find they still love each other.OK for starters--I'm a gay man who is proud to be gay. I didn't dislike this movie because of homophobia (internalized or otherwise). The gay story is what kept me watching in fact. The acting is all good with Ledger a standout. You see his character's pain and confusion and he ages VERY convincingly. Gyllenhaal is good too but not as good as Ledger. The cinematography is beautiful...but I was bored silly. The movie moved VERY slowly and was way too quiet. I lost track of how many times I looked at my watch. Also the love story between the men (which I thought was the main point of the movie) was very subdued and only a small portion of the film. When it gets into the dreary domestic portions I was bored--it was only when Ledger and Gyllenhaal are dealing with their relationship that this movie worked. Also the dialogue was wooden--the actors do their best but there's little they can do with this.Why this is getting so critically praised is beyond me. And why are Ledger and Gyllenhaal being called so ""brave"" to play gay men? I don't think anybody would say they were ""brave"" to play murderers, rapists or killers. As it is they both seem terrified to show any love or emotion. The one sex scene was violent--not erotic and the big kissing scene was almost completely hidden by Jake's hat. However I think the main problem with this film was the director. Ang Lee is a good director--but all wrong for this. He seems too timid to fully address the issue and throws in all these pointless subplots. There's also no need for this film to run over two hours.I give it a 1. I really can not recommend this film.",Brokeback Mountain
22,CinemaSerf,Forbidden love in dangerous times...,7,5 August 2020,"It's fifteen years since I saw this film for the first time and it has, like a good bottle of wine, aged rather well. I always rather resented all the hype apportioned at the time to this rather dreary melodrama about two men who got it on, on occassion, whilst leading their normal heterosexual lives with wives, children, jobs and the like for the rest of the time. It is, however, far more nuanced than that - it has a strong gay theme, but it also deals, conscientiously, with a whole load of other prejudices not least the role of women and the surfeit of bigotry and hatred in 1960's and 1970s America set amongst an almost exclusively white environment. The performances from Heath Ledger (""Ennis"") and Jake Gyllenhaal (""Jack"") are poignant and strong; they deliver a sense of their unrequited love not in a slushy, sentimental manner, but in a reluctant, resigned fashion - a condition imposed upon them by the morals of their day. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway, as their respective spouses, counter-balance that narrative cleverly, with Williams in, I think, her best acting role as the wife who discovers that her husband ""Ennis"" has his secret fairly early on in their marriage. The ageing process, delivering little by way of any substantive improvement in anyone's lives is expertly handled by Ang Lee and the ending, though sad, seems oddly fitting. To be fair, the potency of this (originally short) story has diminished over the years; but I think that testifies to the importance of two box-office mainstreamers prepared to take on something of a taboo and though there are no rose-covered cottage happy endings, this should still make folks think about their intolerances, even now and draw some attention to what many just take for granted.",Brokeback Mountain
23,dbborroughs,Good but not great tragic love story,6,5 February 2006,"This the story of two men who fall in love and can't come to terms with the relationship.I'm probably going to be in the minority, but I find this movie to be very over rated. Its not bad, but over produced and so incredibly pretty that this film struck me as being more of a lets pretend than a real life story. Its very artificial in way that makes me think that perhaps the producers and the director didn't truly trust the material to draw people in, so spiced it up. If you tell a story correctly the film will cross boundaries and move people regardless of the subject matter or sexual orientation. This movie never moved me. As I sat there and watched the film I kept wondering what this would have looked like had some one like John Huston or Sam Peckinpah would have done it as a small gritty western ala The Misfits. (Then again nobody would have probably noticed it) Sure to win a good number of Oscars this is not a bad movie, just a very over rated one.",Brokeback Mountain
24,Bunuel1976,"Brokeback Mountain (Ang Lee, 2005) ***",6,5 May 2006,"I had a chance to watch this highly-acclaimed, award-winning film on the big screen while I was in Hollywood at the beginning of the year but, put off by the subject matter, I resisted doing so - until now. Well, while essentially a good film, I'll certainly join the chorus of those who consider it quite overrated! It's definitely not the first (or most significant) gay-themed American film, mainstream or otherwise - and, vis-à-vis my recent viewing of Nagisa Oshima's samurai picture, GOHATTO (1999), it's hardly the first to put this kind of spin on popular film genres either! Anyway, the two men's relationship comes out of nowhere really (boredom and the extreme cold of the mountains, maybe?), especially since both state that they're not ""queer""; besides, there's no attempt at an explanation of why it should have lasted two decades! This lack of conviction, therefore, coupled with the slow pace results in a deadly first half…but the film improves somewhat with its depiction of the two characters' drab family life.The third and least interesting major ""cowboy"" film from Larry McMurtry (the others being HUD [1963] and THE LAST PICTURE SHOW [1971]), it's well-acted by an ensemble cast - even if Heath Ledger lays on the mumbling James Dean persona a bit too thick! In the end, Ang Lee's surprising choice as director eventually emerges a sound one, as he gives the film a welcome arty feel; another major asset is the melancholy score.",Brokeback Mountain
25,lastliberal,Love on the Mountain,10,28 January 2006,"When I first real Annie Proulx's book Close Range, I was captivated. She is a fantastic writer and really captures the feeling of the West. Brokeback Mountain was just one story in the book, and now, because of the movie, it is a book unto itself. Personally, I would recommend Close Range over a separate Brokeback Mountain. You may not be familiar to Proulx's writing, but many have seen another of her books made into a movie - The Shipping News. One can only hope that this continues with That Old Ace in the Hole, another great work of hers set in the Texas Panhandle, where I lived for almost ten years. I haven't read Bad Dirt yet, but it is on my list as it is a followup to Close Range.But this isn't supposed to be about Proulx, but about Ang Lee's adaptation of her short story into the movie Brokeback Mountain. I was captivated by this movie. I was so captivated that is Angelina Jolie and Halle Berry sat on either side of me during the film, I would not have noticed. Well, that may be too much, but you get the idea.The scenery and the music were both an integral part of the experience. It was an experience, not just a film. I was aching to be up on that mountain for the summer and enjoy it's beauty. The music added so much to that beauty. It just seemed to sweep me away.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal played incredible parts and really made you feel part of a tortured and impossible love. I should point out to those who may feel that there are parts of the movie they may find disturbing that they were done in such a manner that they were meant to show love, not titillation. In fact, the only titillating part were Michelle Williams incredibly beautiful breasts. I will say that I would not want to have to choose between Williams and Rachel Weisz for the Oscar next month.Brokeback Mountain was a beautiful love story and a beautiful experience.",Brokeback Mountain
26,grantss,"Moving, groundbreaking drama",8,19 April 2015,"Moving, groundbreaking drama,Original drama, about a homosexual relationship between two cowboys. There had been movies with homosexual characters in the lead before (The Sum of Us springs most immediately to mind), but this adds something new. It spans 20 or so years, and covers all the ups and downs, issues (real and imagined) in their lives and relationship. Societal problems are also examined.Moving ending.Great performance by Heath Ledger in the lead role. Good support from Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Williams. All three received Oscar nominations.Great cinematography and scenery too.Only issues I have with the movie is that it possibly wasn't engaging enough. It seems to drift in spells. Ultimately, while showing the dilemma the two have, there isn't a great solution or profound moment at the end. Not that the movie needed to necessarily have one. Life doesn't always turn out neat solutions to problems, and the movie was more about the journey through the two's lives than the ending. However, after all that had gone before, maybe a more powerful ending was called for.",Brokeback Mountain
27,Boba_Fett1138,A humble and sweet love-story.,8,18 May 2012,"This movie might had sparked some controversy at the time but the actual movie itself is kept very simplistic and humble. It doesn't feel like it necessarily wanted- or tried to be revolutionary, confronting or controversial. It simply tries to tell a good and sweet little love-story. And the movie actually succeeded very well at doing just that.It's definitely the more independent type of movie, made with a low budget and a small cast and crew, that just happened to blow up big time because of its subject. Sure, nothing unusual about a romantic movie with a big name cast in it but it is when the main focus of its story is about the love between two men, played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal in this case.To me the movie however never necessarily felt like a homosexual love story. It just happened to be so that the movie featured two human beings, who got strongly attracted to each other and happened to be of the same sex. I don't even fully believe that both characters were necessarily homosexual themselves. It simply just happened to them, with as a result a conflict between the heart and mind. They definitely want to be together all the time, since it feels right for both of them but not at all costs. This brings up some interesting dilemmas and drama, which also involves different characters, such as the wives and families of the two men.It really is ultimately a very sweet movie, despite of all the drama that is happening as well. It never goes over-the-top with anything and keeps things real and sensible at all times. The characters, their motivations and behavior are all very convincing, making this a mostly realistic genre movie as well.It also definitely works out well because of its acting. These sort of roles are never easy to play for guys, who are not into guys themselves but both Heath Ledger Jake Gyllenhaal deserve lots of praise and credit for their performances and commitment to this movie and their roles. There were certainly not holding back in anyway and were fully prepared and willing to go all the way with their performances.The movie is besides also a good looking- and well made one. Things are deliberately being kept small and simple, so there are no distractions from its main story. It has some great directing by Ang Lee in it, who tells the story both through its imagery and by getting the best out of its actors. No, I wasn't fond of just everything. Sometimes things felt rushed and it seemed like it skipped over certain things too fast and easily. Who knows, maybe an additional 30 minutes could had done a lot more for the movie and its story.Simply a good, simplistic and besides of course also original love-story!8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Brokeback Mountain
28,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Must-watch, possibly one of the few examples of a perfect film",10,21 February 2012,"In 1963, two young men meet at the titular mountain, where they have to take care of a farmer's sheep. They soon fall for each other(and whether you're open to it or not, I think it'd be hard to make the case that they aren't sweet together, and the intimacy they share is endearing), and this follows them over decades(and a sedate pacing, not to be confused with this being boring, helps convey that this is an entire life) as they try to balance this necessarily secret, forbidden love(and it becomes one of the best stories about such; it didn't ""need"" to be about two males, but I'm glad it is, now it's there to refer to), as well as conform and raise straight families. The power and the beauty of the emotion is conveyed. This is remarkably effective, engaging from the first frame(frankly, I can't think of a detail to this I'd change), it made me laugh, at one point I cheered, and I very nearly cried more than once. The two leads are the idealistic Jack(Gyllenhaal) who is comfortable with himself, and the pragmatic Ennis(Ledger) who can't accept his nature(and is conflicted and aggressive because of it... hey, opposites attract), and their relationship(among that of them with their parents and families, old and new alike) is the main focus, but all of the characters are credible, well-rounded, and several of them, quite charming. No one is a ""villain"" in this. The rigidity of the society is a negative, but the romance is not presented as without problems. It is not the fault of the women in their lives, the ones they marry or father... and the performances of Hathaway, Williams and Cardellini live up to these nuanced roles. In fact, all of the acting is phenomenal. If anyone wasn't brilliant, it would be some of the children, and... they're kids! Heck, most of them even go for the Southern accent, and do well at it. Anna Faris, of all people, was good in this, in what's practically a cameo! This is impeccably filmed and edited. The grit and harshness of life in the rustic environment(even so recently) is gone into, and this is rather realistic. There is a bit of overt(if not all graphic) sexuality(homo and hetero), disturbing content and strong language, and a little nudity(frontal female, and brief full frontal male) and bloody violence in this. The DVD comes with the well-done documentaries Sharing The Story: Making of(21 minutes), Script to Screen(11 minutes), Directing From the Heart: Ang Lee(7 and a half minutes), the featurette On Being a Cowboy(6 minutes), which I will review on its individual page here on the site, and a trailer for each of the following: Mrs. Henderson Presents, Gasolin', Romance and Cigarettes and My Date With Drew. I recommend this wholeheartedly to everyone mature enough for it. 10/10",Brokeback Mountain
29,george.schmidt,Heartbreak Ridge: Ledger & Gyllenhaal give Oscar worthy turns in a seemingly radical love story for the ages,10,14 December 2005,"BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN (2005) **** Jake Gyllenhaal, Heath Ledger, Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway, Randy Quaid, Linda Cardellini, Anna Faris, Scott Michael Campbell, Kate Mara, Cheyenne Hill, Brooklynn Proulx, Graham Beckel, Mary Liboiron, Roberta Maxwell, Peter McRobbie.Heartbreak Ridge: Ledger & Gyllenhaal give Oscar worthy turns in a seemingly radical love story for the ages.Rising stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger give Oscar worthy turns in this exceptional adaptation of E. Annie Proulx's short story (screenplay by novelist Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana deserve an Academy nod too) about two cowboys circa 1963 who work together in Wyoming at the titular foundation for a no-nonsense rancher (Quaid) whose sheep need keeping in the summer for the duration. It is here where the loneliness and remoteness sets in for the two young men who bond quickly in more ways than one.Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal) is a rudderless rodeo cowboy who has no real ambitions to speak of and a family he is keeping at a distance while Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) is more of a quiet spoken, well-mannered cowpoke who wants nothing more than to wed his girlfriend Alma Beers (Williams in an excellent supporting turn) and have a small piece of land to call his own. What both men don't plan on is the rigorous daily rut of the sheep drive and the hazards along the way and on one frigid night share more than a pup tent together. Jack apparently has no qualms about having some rough sex with the inexperienced but hungry for comfort Ennis and the two wind up falling in love yet both claim they are not queer (remember this was before 'gay' was deemed in the popular lexicon as p.c. or not) yet it is undeniable that they cannot even categorize what they really feel for one another.When the job ends they part ways yet both yearn for one another and after Ennis settles down to a family life with two daughters and Alma he gets a postcard four years later from Jack who has set himself with a wife as well, the beautiful yet bored Lureen Newsome (gorgeous Hathaway also doing some fine work here in a more complex yet unflashy role) in Texas working for her jerk father L.D. (Beckel) selling top of the line farming equipment. When Ennis learns of Jack's impeding visit he is like a schoolgirl learning her boyfriend wants to go steady.The pair wind up going on several 'fishing' holidays per year for nearly two decades all the while Ennis remaining skittish about the two sharing Jack's dream of them setting up a ranch for themselves (even suggesting fixing up his estranged father's farm) and finding true happiness. Jack cannot fathom why Ennis will not acquiesce and Ennis cannot conceive of becoming a social pariah (even as Alma has remained silent when she discovers his secret) which stems from a childhood incident where his father brought him and his brother to see the result of a horrible gay bashing that has been burned into his memory like a branded mark on a cattle hide.Directed by the unlikely Ang Lee - who continues to be one of the most versatile and accomplished filmmakers to date - the film is an unapologetic old fashioned love story whose 'gimmick' of it being between two males instead of the traditional boy/girl love affair speaks volumes about forbidden love, life- changing trysts and male bonding to the nth degree.Ledger is a revelation for his implosive, barely able to express himself through a seemingly clenched jaw in short, barely comprehensible utterances that are more like gut wrenching tics and Gyllenhaal balances his partner with a wildboy who can't wait to be tamed but lives for something more than his lover can provide. Both actors deserve nominations come award season as well as the film on a whole.Filmed on location in Alberta, Canada and New Mexico the awesome landscapes of nature's background is indeed something to behold taking on mythic spins to what being 'macho' and a cowboy is all about with lovely panoramic camera work by Rodrigo Prieto and the sad quiet score by Gustavo Santaolalla provides subtle variations to the moods of the conflicted couple.One of the year's best and destined to be a tear-jerking classic.",Brokeback Mountain
30,evanston_dad,Ang Lee's Last Picture Show,10,27 December 2005,"Perhaps the saddest thing about ""Brokeback Mountain"" is that, though the story begins in 1963 and ends roughly in the early 80s, Ang Lee's film could have been set in the present day and not much would be different. Homosexuality has become almost stylish in America's urban areas, but out in the heartland, where men are still meant to be MEN, I can still see how homosexuals could spend their entire life in the closet for fear of being completely rejected, if not worse, by the society around them.""Brokeback Mountain"" put me in the mind of last year's ""Million Dollar Baby"" in its approach to controversial subject matter. Like Clint Eastwood's film, ""Mountain"" avoids becoming an ""issue"" movie. The point is not whether you think homosexuality is sinful, or that all gay people are damned to hell, etc. The point is about whether two human beings who share an emotional connection should be able to act on that. And I would think someone would have to have a heart of ice to come out of this film and not recognize how tragic it is that two people who obviously care as much about each other as the two men in this film do should have to live in fear of expressing their bond. The film also put me in mind of ""Baby"" in its style--spare, quiet, unsentimental. The most important thoughts and feelings are conveyed through what remains unsaid.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal give sensational and, for two straight heartthrob Hollywood actors, quite brave performances. Ledger especially is a revelation. Nothing he's ever done up to this point, with maybe the exception of his brief performance in ""Monster's Ball,"" prepared me for his work here. He has a tough role, as Ennis Delmar, the character he plays, has an instinctual inability to show emotion of any kind. You can see in Ledger's face that his character thinks it's unmanly to expose himself, so his Ennis is all clenched jaw and swallowed words. The only emotion he expresses is violence; whether it's anger, grief, despair or even lust, his first instinct is to lash out and cause pain.Gyllenhaal's Jack Twist is the more gregarious of the two, and the more willing to take risks with their shared secret. Ennis is more grounded in the reality of his environment. He accepts an occasional escape with Jack up into the mountains as more than either of them have the right to expect. Jack, on the other hand, as he says at one point in the film, isn't able to get what he needs from a secret meeting every couple of years. He wants a full committed relationship with Ennis, and is too rebellious to let the cowboy culture in which they live prevent them from having that. His character comes across as restless and reckless. You're left wondering whether Jack is attached to Ennis specifically or just the satisfying of desires that Ennis makes possible, until the film's final moments, when you realize just how important a role Ennis played in Jack's life.Meanwhile, the two principal actresses, Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway, deliver bravura performances in small roles, conveying loads of emotion in a facial expression or gesture. Watch Williams's face when she sees her husband, Ennis, locked in a kiss with Jack. Or watch Hathaway's when Ennis calls her near the end of the film to talk about Jack, and you realize that this wife who appeared throughout the film to know nothing about her husband's clandestine personal life seems to know a great deal, and has been hurt considerably by it.Ang Lee nails the good ol' boy culture of the American west. One has to think that screenwriter Larry McMurty also helped in this department. Like his ""The Last Picture Show,"" ""Brokeback Mountain"" paints a desolate portrait of deserted Western towns. These are essentially ghost towns, even though they're full of people. Boredom and stagnation are the norm. Men are men and women are women. Gender roles are strictly assigned and there's no deviation. In fact, one wonders at times whether or not Ennis is strictly gay, or whether he forms a bond with Jack because he's the one person with whom Ennis feels safe to be freely emotional without the fear of judgement. At times, it seems as if Ennis is drawn to Jack not because he's a man, but because he's another human being who seems to understand him.It's really amazing and heartening that a film with this subject matter is finding such mainstream appeal. It remains to be seen how much of an audience it draws outside of the urban areas. It would be nice to think that Americans everywhere will be able to put aside preconceived attitudes and be able to appreciate what is essentially a tragedy about two caring human beings, but that's probably too much to hope for. But even if this film makes a few people across the country think twice about passing judgement on people different from themselves, it will have served a valuable purpose.Grade: A",Brokeback Mountain
31,AlsExGal,This tragic and powerful love story will haunt you,9,27 March 2013,"This film is about love lost for the sake of keeping up appearances that, in the end, just makes everyone involved miserable. Ennis and Jack are two young men who spend the summer of 1963 herding sheep in Wyoming on an isolated mountain. Ennis is the strong silent type in the Gary Cooper tradition, while Jack is more outgoing. During the two months they are together they become friends and then lovers. Had the time and place been different, they would have probably stayed together, based on the powerful scene in which they go their separate ways after that first summer. However, with the culture being that of the rugged mountain west and the time that of the early sixties, this was an impossibility. The reaction of their boss and Ennis' wife when they discover what is going on tells you what they could have looked forward to if they had been open about their relationship - muted ostracism by daylight, perhaps violence come nightfall. At first, the two just try to put their feelings for each other behind them. Ennis, already engaged, goes through with his marriage as planned and fathers two daughters. Jack goes back to Texas, meets and marries the daughter of a wealthy farm equipment dealer, and fathers a son. Four years after their initial separation, Jack returns to Wyoming and their relationship picks up where it left off - still a secret, this time on the pretext of week-long ""fishing trips"" they take two or three times a year for the next fifteen years, never able to tell anyone about their love, never able to show their affection in public. Many have mentioned that the two were just cheating on their wives all of this time, but the fact is if they had been able to follow their hearts, they would have never had wives to begin with.Much of what is great about this film is what is left unsaid. Is Ennis actually homosexual or did he just fall in love with someone who happened to be a man? Did Jack die the way his wife said he did or he way Ennis imagined? Did Jack lie to Ennis that last time they were together and say he was having an affair with a woman because he knew Ennis would be jealous of another man but not another woman? Did Jack deliberately take Ennis' shirt as a reminder of him that first summer or did he just find it and decide to keep it? The acting is tremendous, and I find myself mourning the tragedy of the characters in this film as though they were real people, although I'm sure their situation represents many real ones past and present. This is a beautiful and thoughtful film that definitely should have won the Best Picture Oscar. Jack and Ennis' double lives just leave themselves, their wives, and everyone else who is close to them feeling empty and just add up to time and opportunity lost.

One of the most anticipated films of the year, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a beautiful trip down a painful road. Based on the short story of Annie Proulx, the great Larry McMurtry has provided a screenplay that is both effective and affective. Director Ang Lee (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"") does the rest.The two lead characters played by Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger are very solid - Ledger is even exceptional in parts with his marble-mouth manner of speech. However, the two things that take this film to greatness are the painful story and the stunning photography. Although postcards play a role in the story, numerous shots in the film are as beautiful as any postcard or painting ever seen. Lee proves again that his eye for nature is without equal.If one can view this as a forsaken love story rather than a gay cowboy movie, the impact proves much greater - even powerful. While Gylenhaal's Jack ""f'n"" Twist finds an easy way to cope, Ledger's Ennis continues his lifelong struggle with merely existing. His attempts at relationships are always missing something and we have no problem believing this is due to his very rough childhood. His marriage to Michelle Williams (Ledger's real life squeeze) is torturous to watch and she is marvelous in her discovering the truth about her husband. Randy Quaid has a nice turn as the boss who first hires Gylenhaal and Ledger, and Anne Hathaway is fine as Mrs. Twist.The real credit for this masterpiece goes to Lee, McMurtry and Proulx. A haunting guitar theme compliments a monumental piece of film story telling that covers two decades of forbidden and stolen love. Not always easy to watch, but definitely worth it.",Brokeback Mountain
33,HotToastyRag,A beautiful love story,8,30 March 2021,"Nobody ever thought, when news that Brokeback Mountain was being made, that it would be a hit, a classic as time passed, and an awards sweeper during the year's season. People made jokes about it, the very idea that two tough, rugged cowboys would ""turn gay"" while living out in the mountains without any women around. And then, slowly but surely, all the people who watched the movie stopped laughing - myself included. Yes, there's still the ""I wish I knew how to quit you"" line that elicits a chuckle, but it doesn't have anything to do with the gender of the speaker or the listener. It's just a funny line, no matter who says it to whom.Visually, it's a beautiful movie to look at. The rolling hills, the colors of the grass and sky, and the slow pace to help you appreciate nature all immerse you in the setting. Ang Lee has quite a repertoire under his belt, and now he can add one of the most famous modern westerns to it.Given the subject matter, there's going to be some controversy about the characters and their feelings. Different schools of thought argue both men are homosexual, both are bisexual, one is and one isn't, etc. Regardless of all the discussions you've had with your friends about what the movie really means, it certainly brings up the question: can a person be a heterosexual and fall in love with someone of the same sex? Just like the film Gaslight spawned the titular verb that has lasted for eighty years, Brokeback Mountain has created a similar legacy. If you have a celebrity crush on someone of the same sex, chances are your friends have teased you for ""going Brokeback Mountain.""There are some people who are not going to like this movie, so I won't blindly recommend it to everyone. If you've thought about the subject matter and trust Ang Lee to film it tastefully, give it a shot. If you appreciate very well-acted dramas, you'll probably like it. Parts of it are hard to watch, but that's the nature of the setting. Both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal pour their hearts into the movie, and their long-suffering wives Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway hold their own in a story that isn't really about them. One last question to ask yourself if you're still on the fence about renting it: would you want to see a movie about a cowboy and a cowgirl who fall in love while living out in the mountains without their spouses? Because that's the story; two people fall in love. They just both happen to be men.",Brokeback Mountain
34,gradyharp,Discovering Love: The Longing to Make It Fit,10,17 December 2005,"E. Annie Proulx visited a cowboy bar in Wyoming and felt an underlying eroticism seething in that most macho of possible places. That observation translated into a courageous short story in 1997, a study of love between two cowboys whose world would never condone such feelings (remember Laramie?), and so 'Brokeback Mountain' was born in New Yorker Magazine. Now that tender and heartbreaking tale of hidden, durable, passionate love between two young men trapped in a society that will not allow such feelings has been luminously transformed in to a film: it is rewarding to see how successful that long journey became.The story is so well known that it need not be summarized beyond the brief statement that two nineteen year old young men, both with histories of abandonment, need, and pain, find physical attraction in the cold nights on Brokeback Mountain while guarding sheep, and though both assure each other that neither is gay, the love creeps out of the night physicality into the daytime sunny thrills of feeling alive and cared for. After only a couple of months, their job completed, they part ways, each marrying, having children, but over almost twenty years they periodically reconnect, understanding the depth of their forbidden love, and cope the best they can. Divorces ensue, promises of being together permanently are thwarted by a number of reasons, and the while the story evaporates into the lonely landscape of Wyoming, the love that bonded them, a love they could never 'own', ends.Ang Lee molds this magnificently poignant love story with grace, style, realism, and bravery. Proulx's story is made visual by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana's screenplay and while the script is true to the story on the whole, there is much added business about the wives and children and parents that perhaps is necessary for moviegoers to 'get it', but in this viewer's mind is less sensitive than the extended silences within the vast spaces of Wyoming that made Proulx' story so quietly and powerfully understated. Heath Ledger is superb as Ennis Del Mar but Jake Gyllenhaal is equally as strong as Jack Twist: together they create a chemistry racked with pain as well as bliss and make their characters totally believable. Michelle Williams does well as Ennis' long suffering wife Alma, while Anne Hathaway remains Anne Hathaway, a lady far too elegant to be convincing as the cowgirl Lurene the Jack marries in the vacuum without Ennis.But criticisms are few (the only major one is that Gyllenhaal has not been sufficiently recognized for his brilliant portrayal in Heath Ledger's shadow). This is a beautiful film that addresses love and all its permutations and it is so refreshing to see a story of this depth and significance so quietly and tenderly placed before the theater audience. Highly recommended. Grady Harp, December 05",Brokeback Mountain
35,The_Void,Ride hi-....on second thoughts; nevermind...,6,15 February 2006,"Romance films aren't really my thing at the best of times - so since this is one about two men falling in love, I think I was justified about not wanting to see it. And if it wasn't for the fact that I've seen the other four 'Best Picture' nominees for 2005, I probably would have stuck to that. Anyway, I did see it; and surprisingly, it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Naturally, the technical elements of the film are all spot on; acting, directing, locations etc are all good enough, so I wont bother mentioning those things too much. This isn't really a western, although it is set in the land of cowboy hats and people who drink whiskey out of the bottle; and this location choice offsets the central theme of the film. Films set in this place are usually macho affairs...which helps to make the plot line as bold as possible. The film follows the story of two ranchers that are sent up Brokeback Mountain to look after some sheep. However, the sheep quickly fail to be number one priority when the two men realise that they're more interested in each other...The angle of the film is actually quite predictable; these two 'love' each other, yet they aren't allowed to be together; thus meaning that we have a tragic film. The way the plot handles this theme with regards to the characters is rather black and white; and while they both suffer mental trauma which surfaces in violent and teary outbursts - it all feels very one-sided, and the characters don't flourish as complete wholes. I realise it's difficult to create well rounded characters in a two hour running time; but the film would have benefited immensely if we were allowed to learn a little more about the two men, besides the fact that they want one another. I can't say I cared too much about their relationship either, as it seemed a bit too cold and it's hard to believe that these two have built up such a passion for each other over a few intervals. The film seems to profess that the relationship is about each other, not just about being gay - but that doesn't actually come out until the end, and by then it feels tacked on. I'd have loved to have seen Elton John and Boy George in the leads; but those roles have gone to Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, who both act to their best under the assured direction of Ang Lee. On the whole, this film is an interesting way to spend two hours - although I can't say I'm overly impressed with it, but at least it didn't go overboard with 'tender' scenes between the leads.",Brokeback Mountain
36,Sylviastel,Why Brokeback Lost the Oscar?,2,21 August 2006,"Do you really want to know why it didn't win the Oscar? Well maybe because prior to the Academy Awards, we were bombarded with how great this film was. It was considered groundbreaking, controversial, etc. and it widely praised. Did it ever occur to anybody that it would turn off the Oscar Voters? Of course it didn't that would be too easy, you make a film and promote it so heavily that brokeback fever became brokeback annoyance. You just wanted to get away from all the hype. I hated seeing the signs on the London tubes and billboards everywhere. This film was not going to get to me as it did others. I'm too strong for that. Just like Titanic which I never saw, I got sick of hearing about how wonderful Brokeback is. I think Mad TV depicted a great sketch about it with two girls. When one said ""I wish I could quit you but my husband won't let me?"" and the other replied ""My husband drove me up here."" THe first replied ""My husband is over there."" I have to say that I never laughed so hard because that was the depth of the film itself. So Crash beat Brokeback, finally a film inspired by life in Los ANgeles for a change, set in Hollywood and filmed there. Who are the Hollywood Oscar voters? The people who work there that's who. THey didn't film Crash in Vancouver because they could for cheaper but anyway, who gets the last laugh. Now if only I bet on Crash in the first place. By the way since I wrote this interview, I got a very negative email about my comment. Funny, I have written over 400 reviews for this site and this one came back. I won't delete this review because I think I have something important to say about the film itself. I don't care about the homosexuality. I am a liberal lefty feminist who does support gay rights to marry, adopt children, divorce and equal rights to benefits. I am not homophobic in the least and if you think I am then I recommend reading some of my other reviews for Portrait of a Marriage and Paris Was a Woman. Just for the record, this is only a movie.",Brokeback Mountain
37,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Brokeback Mountain,9,10 February 2006,"Here's my challenge: Watch Casanova and Jarhead (both now showing in local theaters) before watching Brokeback Mountain, to appreciate and to keep fresh in your mind, the acting range of both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. One plays a king of lovemaking, while the other plays an army grunt, in which both are alpha-males roles. Then when you watch Brokeback Mountain, you'll probably be wide-eyed at how these two have a go at each other.Based upon the 1997 short story by Edna Anne Proulx, you must have your head stuck in mud if you're not aware this movie is about two cowboy shepherds who share a relationship up in the mountains of Brokeback. Set in 1963, we see Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) and Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal) team up in their job to shepherd sheep to graze, and having strict orders to be separate most times to take care of their flock.But being together alone in the mountains, sharing their lives with each other, brings them too close, and soon, they share a forbidden illicit relationship (hey, they're supposed to be macho cowboys, and it's the 60s of free love and Vietnam looming) that transcends the usual boundaries of male bonding.It's like a summer love, and after an hour into the film, we explore how this love affect them as they try to ease themselves back to normalcy. Except that things are never going to be normal anymore. While they establish families - Del Mar with his be-throed Alma (Michelle Williams), and Twist with rich Lureen Newsome (Anne Hathaway in another role which she shows off her assets), they cannot forget their throes of passion they had sparked back in summer of 63. Before long, they get together again to reignite their passion for each other and continue over a period of 20 years.One thing's for sure, the story will still play out decently if you substitute gay love with heterosexual roles, like the countless of movies on cheating spouses, but there'll be a very distinct lack of punch. You'll notice that the male couples share similar trials and tribulations of any relationship - the love, passion, how much one party is willing to give the other, and how much the other will reciprocate, and unfulfilled dreams. What gives this movie the edge is how the characters are compelled to look for each other for solace, and the deceit and lies they have to go through in order to be together.It's a movie that's paced slowly, but gives opportunity for the audience to admire the postcard perfect (CGI-enhanced) landscape of the mountains and plains, to study the expressions of the characters, to listen and ponder upon the dialog. Lee Ang had made Chinese Wu-Xia movies sexy, and it's no wonder that he has also managed to add a touch of sensuality that permeates throughout Brokeback. The hauntingly beautiful soundtrack helps too in keeping the mood and emotions in check, serving to add to the narrative in periods of silenced dialog.Perhaps something which I thought was pretty neat, was the idea brought forward from Kinsey, that there is a degree of homosexuality in all of us, and it depends on how gay you are, or have the courage, to come out of the closet. What's interesting is when you think about whether the notion of gayness stems from nature, or nurture. If you'd seen the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about, and how passion can consume someone, that it takes over all sensibility, and about the propensity of risk you're willing to take.Heath Ledger had a pretty busy 2005, with diverse roles in Brothers Grimm, Lords of Dogtown, Casanova and this. I've seen all of them, and while I disliked Grimm, I thought his roles in 2005 should be credited with an Oscar win for this. Jake Gyllenhaal too plays Twist with a touch of machoness, and yet is able to slip back into needy whining gentleness with a flick of a switch. Michelle Williams' role, while small, is accentuated by the particular one scene in which she discover the truth. It is powerful - nothing much said, but everything said through the eyes. Perhaps the weakness link is Hathaway with her megawatt smile and bimbotic blonde looks, as the clueless wife of Twist caught in between some major family squabbles.Homophobes will probably give this movie a miss, but to generally brand this as a gay movie will be missing the point. I'd recommend it to everyone I know to watch this with an open mind. It's an out-and-out dramatic story on relationships, and it's classic storytelling at its best, with excellent acting and strong direction, cinematography, heck, this movie deserves its 8 Academy nominations, so let's see it take home some honors (I'm not sticking my neck out just yet, until I watch all the other contenders).P.S. Yes, this movie is shown here uncut. If you're not celebrating this movie, at least celebrate the fact that we can get to watch it here as it is intended to be.",Brokeback Mountain
38,JamesHitchcock,Gay is the New Black,5,20 May 2010,"When ""Brokeback Mountain"" controversially, and rather unexpectedly, failed to win the ""Best Picture"" Oscar for 2005, Annie Proulx, the author of the short story on which it was based, angrily accused the Academy of homophobic bias and, speaking sarcastically of ""Crash"", the anti-racist film which actually did win, said that ""Next year we can look to the awards for controversial themes on the punishment of adulterers with a branding iron in the shape of the letter A, runaway slaves, and the debate over free silver"".In other words, films about racism may have been ground-breaking and controversial in the days of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and ""In the Heat of the Night"", but today they are old hat. If you want something truly controversial and ground-breaking in the 21st century, try homosexuality. Gay is the new black.My initial reaction to Proulx's display of sour grapes was: If only racism were as safely confined to the past as the debate over free silver! Yet in one respect, perhaps, she was right. Although racist attitudes remain endemic in America (and many other societies) there are few people today outside the lunatic fringe who would openly proclaim that one race is innately superior to another. There are plenty (in some states perhaps the majority) who would quite openly proclaim their belief that homosexuality is sinful, perverted or both. So to that extent a film about homophobia can indeed be seen as more daring or controversial than one about racism.Where Proulx is wrong is in her implied assumption that Oscars are, or should be, awarded on the basis of daring, controversy or political correctness rather than on merit. And- let me come out of the closet here- my view is that, on merit, ""Crash"" (or ""Trash"" as Proulx preferred to call it) is by far the better of the two films.""Brokeback Mountain"" is a modern-day Western set in the period between 1963 and 1981. The protagonists are two ranch hands, Jack Twist and Ennis del Mar, who, fall in love and begin a sexual relationship while working together in Wyoming. (The title is taken from the fictional mountain where they meet). The film is sometimes described as a ""gay cowboy movie"", although that is inaccurate in one detail, as the two are engaged in herding sheep, not cattle. At the end of their summer together they part and go their separate ways. Both get married, Ennis marrying his long-time fiancée Alma and Jack an attractive female rodeo rider named Lureen. Despite their marriages, Jack and Ennis miss one another, and four years later they resume their affair after meeting again. Their relationship continues over a number of years in a series of trysts which they explain away to their wives as ""fishing trips"". Jack wants to live with Ennis on a permanent basis, but Ennis always refuses, even after his marriage to Alma (who has realised the truth about her husband's sexuality) ends in divorce.My reasons for finding ""Brokeback Mountain"" inferior to ""Crash"" have nothing to do with any prejudice against films about same-sex relationships; I loved, for example, Peter Jackson's ""Heavenly Creatures"", which deals with the subject of lesbianism. ""Crash is an example of what has become known as ""hyperlink cinema"" in which a number of interconnected plot lines are linked together; it is a style of film-making which needs careful handling if it is not to become confusing (""Syriana"" is a good example of what can happen when this style goes wrong), but Haggis handles his material in a masterly way to produce an excellent film. ""Brokeback Mountain"", by comparison, has a much simpler storyline, but is plodding and dull, telling its story at excessive length. Compared to ""Sense and Sensibility"" or ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", this is far from being Ang Lee's best work.As regards the acting, I could never really envisage Jake Gyllenhaal's Jack as a man in the grip of a passion so intense that he was prepared to risk everything for it. Still less Heath Ledger's Ennis, despite the fact that both were Oscar-nominated. Both actors, especially Ledger, seemed to be trying their hardest to get away from the stereotype of the gay man as sensitive and over-emotional, but went to the opposite extreme of portraying their characters as introverted, inarticulate and lacking in emotion. It was also left unclear, in fact, whether we are supposed to regard the two men as gay or bisexual, something which affects the way in which we see them.Probably the best acting performance came from Michelle Williams as the long-suffering Alma, but I felt that the film as a whole under-emphasised the emotional distress that Alma and Lureen would undoubtedly have suffered as a result of their husbands' affair. I also felt that it over-emphasised the supposed bigotry of Westerners; were they really, as late in the 1980s, in the habit of lynching any man they suspected of being homosexual? To conclude, therefore, I felt that of the two films ""Crash"" is better acted, better directed and has a more interesting story. Personally, I would not only have awarded it ""Best Picture"" but, unlike the Academy, would have given ""Best Director"" to Paul Haggis ahead of Ang Lee. 5/10",Brokeback Mountain
39,StevePulaski,"Some will emerge optimistically, while others will emerge not fulfilled",9,27 May 2012,"Brokeback Mountain is a beautiful film in terms of plot, scenery, acting, and execution. Its landscapes alone could give tips to any location photographer old and young, and its screenplay is a work of genuine subtlety conveyed professionally throughout the course of the film. An early scene where both men meet outside, awaiting their job assignments from their boss, you can see the way they look at each other shows they are somewhat interested. The scene is beautifully crafted, and most importantly, doesn't hammer in any overbearing ""love at first sight clichés"" and doesn't make this romance out to be pretentious just because it's different.The men are Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Ledger), two sheepherders who get assigned to work on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming during the summer of '63. Jack and Ennis connect closely on the mountain, and wind up becoming even closer during a night where numerous sips of the bottle are taken. Trying to convince themselves it was a one time thing, feelings become overwhelming, and an emotional and sexual relationship quickly brews.But after the summer is over, the inevitable breeds contempt. Ennis returns home to his fiancée, Alma Beers (Williams), whom he has three children with, and Jack somewhat impulsively marries the beautiful rodeo rider, Lureen Newsome (Hathaway). This seems to be the lives many gay men endure. Fighting urges, resisting temptations, and gridlocking inhibitions and suppression, to live ""the normal"" lifestyle with a wife and kids eventually dying partially satisfied yet unfulfilled. Ennis was taught by his father that being gay was an absolute sin, and since then, he was forced to suppress his feelings and forcefully try to ""straighten"" himself out. It didn't happen.While memories of the summer of '63 loom over their heads, Jack and Ennis try and live comfortable lives, yet still make an effort to see each other when they can. Some confrontations go rather smoothly, others have a contentious presence to them, and some result in punches. The men are saddened at their forced suppression for their feelings, but fear the pending backlash if they were to live the life they want would be crucial and possibly fatal to their happiness. It's a bitter world where intolerance is easier to abide by than acceptance, where turning a blind eye is easier than searching for the truth, and hate is easier to follow than the path of love. This is what makes Brokeback Mountain so hard to watch at times; when those points begin to circle through the viewer's head.There's just one marginally sizable complaint I have with the film and it's the last twenty-five minutes. Inevitably, we know one will die, and in this case, it is Jack. His death is left purposely ambiguous, with Lureen saying he died from a tire that burst when trying to inflate it, and Ennis contemplates that he died from a hate crime. What a petty cliché, used in a film that certainly didn't need it. Romantic comedies that end with a straight romance always end the same way, with the guy and girl falling in love, but the one time we get a mainstream gay romance it ends with the death of one of the men and the feeling of emptiness sadly comes into the picture again. The message Brokeback sends out to people, hetero or homosexual, is basically ""gays can live the life they want, but it will end with woeful calamity."" Aside from the unfortunate path taken in the third act, this is a wonderful film. The photography and scenery of the rural Wyoming is masterfully shot, and probably some of the best cinematography from the last decade along with Road to Perdition. Not to mention, Ang Lee's stellar direction, again focusing on a wide range of shots, ranging from close-ups, to wide angle, to miraculous shots where the scenery becomes the main cast-member. Before taking on the director role for Brokeback, Lee directed Hulk, another film about an outsider looking in, which occupied an impeccable love for storytelling and depth, as well as heartbreaking and distant father/son relationships. The same goes for this film.I have a feeling that many audiences will go in hazy about the idea of a film about two gay men falling in love, but emerge from it sympathetic and optimistic about the homosexual community. While this isn't a perfect excursion, it's a highly memorable one, complete with ecstatic performances, luscious landscapes, and some delightfully fitting music to a story so poignant yet satisfying.Starring: Jake Gyllenhaal, Heath Ledger, Michelle Williams, and Anne Hathaway.

40,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Very powerful and moving, one of the best films of 2005!",10,13 January 2006,"I have just heard so much about ""Brokeback Mountain"", it is crazy. People were either excited to see it or protesting against it's homosexuality theme and all the awards this movie is going up for, the girls at my work and I had to see it and saw this movie last night. You know, I really liked it. I've said it before and I'll say it again, 2005 wasn't the best year for movies, and I'm not just saying this, but I felt that Star Wars, King Kong, and now Brokeback Mountain so far are the only real decent movies to see.The great thing about Brokeback Mountain for those who are uncomfortable with it's themes, the love story between Jack and Ennis is not rubbed in your face in any way. For me, I thought it was extremely touching and real, they had a very strong love for each other. I felt awful for Jack, probably because I can understand since this has happened to a couple of my friends, because he loved Ennis so much and wanted to make their relationship work, but Ennis kind of rejected that thought and just wanted to get back to his normal life. Only seeing Jack 4 or 5 times a year and then going back home to his wife and two girls and just acting like nothing ever happened.The performances in this movie are terrific, all the actors gave it their best shot at becoming who their characters were. The pictures of Brokeback Mountain were just beautiful and relaxing to watch. The whole story is a wonderful one and I would highly recommend this film any day. I hope it does win an Oscar or two. :D 10/10",Brokeback Mountain
41,blanbrn,"Unpredictable and uncommon love that last the times, and remains even when it ends in tragedy.",10,12 February 2007,"This for sure is not your typical cowboys story as it may seem when it starts out, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is something much more special. Starting out in 1963 in rural Wyoming a simple summer friendship is formed by two innocent cowboys by the name of Ennis Del Mar(Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist(Jake Gyllenhaal) only this summer encounter will turn into a lifelong connection of love and friendship. After the summer course of work ends, both return back to their old grounds and each begin new directions. Jack returns to Texas to enjoy the life of a rodeo cowboy and falls in love and marries a sexy and wealthy female(Anne Hathaway) and he begins a family. Ennis stays in Wyoming and marries his old school love(Michelle Williams) and a family of children begins right away, and Ennis has to continue to work hard as a ranch hand. Ennis then four years into his normal world receives a postcard, then him and Jack revisit and again start to have wonderful encounters every so often at Brokeback, this finally costs Ennis his wife. Anyway this strong bond continues year after year as each man goes along with the changes joys and heartbreaks so commonly associated with everyday life. When tragedy strikes and Ennis finds out about the fate of Jack, the emotional love lasts and you get an emotional feel at the tribute that Ennis gives to Jack at the end. I must say great movie and well done especially good acting from Ledger and Gyllenhaal who make both Ennis and Jack such likable characters that you feel emotions for and you feel their hurt. Also way to go for director Ang Lee for having the courage to take on the topic of gay cowboy love, especially the way he directed in the setting of a conservative Wyoming in the 1960's. Lee really proved that love is possible for anyone and that any human being can love another human being no matter who they are.",Brokeback Mountain
42,MovieAddict2016,"A powerful film -- see it for what it is, and try to ignore the controversy",9,13 April 2006,"Those who have protested Brokeback Mountain have likely seen few movies in their lifetime. There's nothing all that daring or new here  two famous young stars playing gay lovers? Wow, that's a first. Unless you are aware of a film called ""My Own Private Idaho"" released a decade and a half ago. You could even be daring enough to claim the first gay cowboy movie was Midnight Cowboy. And let's face it  sexual taboo has been a regular theme in many European films for years.The only difference here is that Brokeback has hit the mainstream and it's been in the Oscar competition, which means more people are likely to be made aware of it  and attack it. The bottom line is: it's not really deserving of the hype about it being a ""gay movie."" It is, however, far more deserving of its critical hype  the praise critics have bestowed upon it for being a good movie. Because it is a good movie. It's a very good movie.Ang Lee is a fine director (if overly ambitious at times  his Hulk was a failure because it tried too hard, the opposite of most comic-book movies)  this is his swan song. At times it is subtle and quiet and at others deeply moving, featuring a graceful dramatic arc that makes a wide sweep across many years in the lives of two men who ""ain't queer"" but are inexplicably drawn to each other as time progresses.The interesting aspect dealt with here  and what makes it better than the gay-exploitation romantic-drama it could have easily been  is that Lee's film studies the impact a forbidden relationship has on two men over a span of time. Both men (played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal in the best performances of their careers) become married and have children  but they also both return to Brokeback Mountain, the place that sparked their secret relationship.There are moments that go on too long or are too slow. There are also a few scenes that cry out, ""Independent!"" (It's got that new Focus Features edge that ""The Station Agent"" and ""Eternal Sunshine"" both also had.) However, for the most part it's a masterfully shot motion picture that deals less with homosexuality and more with the concept of love in general. I don't think the movie's intent is, as some people boycotting Wal-Mart for selling the film have claimed, ""to spread homosexuality."" Anyone who becomes gay after seeing a movie about gay cowboys probably wasn't very straight to begin with.If you see this film, see it for what it is  don't focus too much on the controversy, because it's just publicity at this point. But underneath the controversy-hype there's a really strong, powerful film  yup, far superior to ""Crash"" (which insulted my intelligence)  waiting to break free.A lot of people will feel uneasy watching it (voting statistics on IMDb reveal that the male demographics are responsible for much lower votes than women). Then again, a lot of people will just refuse to even give it that much of a chance and will bash it without even seeing it. That's a shame.",Brokeback Mountain

During their time there, they have developed a special bond which ultimately leads to a romantic love affair.This movie is full of passion and ecstasy as Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger movingly portrays in certain scenes. Their unorthodox relationship showcase each of their desires and vulnerabilities and there is an ounce of suspense when their relationship is hidden from those around them, including their wives.Aside from the secret love affair, the plot is mostly slow and doesn't gain much traction. The supporting characters, particular that of Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway, weren't much emphasized in the movie, cinematography was mediocre, overall character chemistry was lacking and the acting was pretty average. I also couldn't understand much of Ledger's mumbling of his Ennis character, as if he is trying too hard on his cowboy accent.Overall, with it's melancholy setting and lack of any redeeming moments, it's a pretty depressing film.Grade D",Brokeback Mountain

Although the two stories have little in common, knowing that made it difficult for me not to make some comparisons. My reaction to the ""The Shipping News"" was that it came across to me as completely pointless. To be honest, my reaction to the first hour or so of ""Brokeback Mountain"" was essentially the same. Two cowboys go up a mountain and fall in love. OK. The rather out of the ordinary nature of their romance creates some awkwardness for them, but still this didn't seem to be accomplishing very much or really moving anywhere. To be honest, it wasn't even that courageous. Look at the popular media these days. Homosexuality is not exactly a taboo subject anymore. Twenty years ago, this movie might have been courageous. Today, it needs more than supposed controversy to make it worth watching, and it didn't have much more than that for at least half of its run time. About halfway through, though, the pace of the movie picked up noticeably, and there were several very powerful scenes contained in that last hour: Ennis (Heath Ledger) being confronted by his ex-wife, who clearly knows that he and his buddy weren't doing much fishing on those fishing trips; Jack (Jake Gyllenhall) taking on his father in law over a family dinner; discovering Jack's fate, and the visit by Ennis to Jack's parents - these were all very well done and suddenly seemed to give me the feel that this movie had some sort of purpose - dealing with the troubles that arise when love appears in unexpected places. As a corollary to that point, I couldn't help feeling the most sympathy for the wives of Ennis and Jack. Both guys seemed to positively revel in their opportunities to betray their marriage vows.Ledger and Gyllenhall are very good in their roles, and their characters are very different. Jack comes across as essentially a homosexual trying to manage in a straight marriage, whereas Ennis seems to be basically straight but consumed by his inexplicable feelings for this one man. Both were worth watching.I said that I found myself comparing this to ""The Shipping News."" It is - in my opinion - better than ""The Shipping News,"" but is still dragged down by an opening half that didn't seem to want to go anywhere. A strong second half and good lead performances get this a 5/10.",Brokeback Mountain
45,Buddy-51,a breakthrough film,10,9 January 2006,"Is it possible for a film - any film - to truly make the world a better place? I have no way of confidently answering that question, but if any movie COULD do such a thing, then ""Brokeback Mountain"" would be that film. Here's that rare work that has the power to transform not only how the individual sees the world but how society sees itself. By putting something never before seen on the screen, director Ang Lee and writer Larry McMurtry earn their place in movie history - and the undying respect of film lovers everywhere.By now, most people know that ""Brokeback Mountain"" tells the story of Ennis and Jack, two young cowboys who, in the summer of 1963, sign up to herd sheep in Wyoming and wind up falling in love. Jack is the outgoing one of the two, seemingly more in touch with his homosexuality than is Ennis, who is introverted and taciturn almost to the point of somnambulism. Something powerful takes hold of them up there on Brokeback Mountain, and while they both end up going their separate ways - Jack to become a rodeo rider and get married, Ennis to settle down on a ranch with his wife and two little daughters - the attraction they feel for one another never lessens. In fact, it becomes only more intense over the years, as the men come to realize that each has found in the other his true soul mate, his ideal partner for life - if only circumstances and society weren't conspiring to keep them apart. Instead, all they have to hold on to over the next twenty years are a few fleeting but passionate encounters in the one place where they are free to be who they truly are.Tales of unrequited love have, of course, been a staple of literature since storytelling began, but by making this a GAY love story, the filmmakers bring a renewed power to the genre. Forced to look at it from a novel perspective, we feel as if we are seeing romantic love being played out for the first time. There are those who have accused the film of trying to ""glorify"" adulterers, as if this were the first time in which a story of unrequited love involved cheating spouses. Would these same people object to ""Anna Karenina,"" ""Doctor Zhivago"" or ""Brief Encounter"" on such spurious grounds? If anything, ""Brokeback Mountain"" points out the absurdity of a society that tells gay people they shouldn't even BE gay but should live their lives as heterosexuals. If Ennis' and Jack's wives are victims, they are far more the victims of a society that forces gays into loveless marriages than of Ennis and Jack, who are simply conforming to what society itself claims it wants them to be.By making the two central characters rugged macho cowboys, the author of the original short story, E. Annie Proulx, not only shatters a gay stereotype, but brilliantly finds the hitherto elusive portal into the consciousness of a mainstream audience. Certainly, this story would not have worked commercially had it been about two gay hairdressers living in San Francisco. For the first time in a Hollywood film, we have major gay characters who are not AIDS victims, psycho killers or limp-wristed best friends of the main female character. Moreover, the movie subtly plays with the latent homoerotic undercurrents that have always been a part of western folklore but which have heretofore been hidden safely enough under the surface so that only those looking for them could find them. Yet, for all its sociological significance, this is, first and foremost, a story about love - deep, raw, all-consuming love - and it is that which makes the movie connect with all audiences, regardless of sexual orientation.As Ennis, Heath Ledger's performance is nothing short of a revelation, a triumph of minimalist acting. With his tightly pursed lips, barely whispered monotone and slumped shoulders, Ledger brilliantly conveys the soul of a man struggling with the truth about himself and straining with every fiber in his body and being to avoid acknowledging that truth. So tormented is he in his life that Ennis seems to be trying to pull back his words even as he's uttering them. A masterpiece of understatement, Ledger's work here quite simply ranks with the great screen performances of all time. As Jack, Jake Gyllenhall provides the perfect balance for Ledger, a free spirit more willing to take a chance and defy society, if only he could get his partner to go along with him. Michelle Williams hits amazing dramatic heights as Alma, Ennis' bewildered wife, who suffers in silence after she learns the heartbreaking truth about her husband. Ang Lee's direction is intense, lyrical and visually ravishing, zeroing in on the human drama with laser-like precision and making the stark Wyoming landscape an integral part of that drama. Lee makes it so that it is the SILENCES that really matter here, those moments between words when love and feelings are most completely communicated.Just to show that even a great film need not be perfect, there are times when the movie - a tad too long at two hours and 15 minutes - sags a bit by wandering off into one too many subplots. But the emotions in the film are so raw and engulfing that the film at its best makes us realize just how insignificant and piddling most movies really are. This is one movie that actually stays with you long after you've left the theater.When the history of the movies comes to be written, ""Brokeback Mountain"" will take its place among the handful of films that can truly be termed ""watersheds"" or ""landmarks,"" movies that helped to redefine what cinema could be and do. And it will be one of the few, in the long run, that really mattered.",Brokeback Mountain
46,thesar-2,Brokeback Masterpiece,10,21 October 2009,"Brokeback Mountain *****/5 stars 10/21/09This review of 'Brokeback Mountain' is long overdue. I first saw this in 2005, the night before it opened as a sneak-preview. I feel in love with it then, and now, and 4-5 viewings, I consider it a masterpiece. And I do so, from personal experience. I can certainly relate to what the main characters are going through, and watching their facial expressions, eyes and motions; they are truly real. I've gone through what they did (for the most part.) What society teaches us, at a very young age, is: grow, get married, have offspring. There is no room for people that think outside the box. And so these two lead cowboys did just that. Sad. Tragedy ensured, of course. They were the square pegs in round holes that tried what society taught them and they cheated to their one true love: each other. If there were no other evidence, there's the Academy Awards that ignored this masterpiece due to homophobia. Tragic that they missed out on a perfect film in all categories: music, score, beautiful cinematography, acting, script/dialogue, originality. I mean, this movie worked on every level. But, what I focused in on was, very simply, these two heterosexual actors showing true love for each other on screen. I truly believed that from the get-go. I would've rated the movie the same if it were cowboy and girl, as long as they led me to believe in their need of each other. Two cowboys meet and fall in love, but (as previously mentioned) society taught them the breeder way and they part company only to meet up several times a year for 20 years. Trust me, for people that object to this kind of love, you see this as black/white but the heart bleeds/cries when it can't be whole.Side Note: I hope this movie serves as a message for young viewers (of age to see it, that is): Please don't waste your time, 20 years in this film's timeline, listening to others. If you find true love like this and even if it only lasts but a moment, cherish it. Nurture it. I don't condone adultery. So don't let it get to that. I felt for the women (well, not so much for Hathaway character – she was married for convenience) and I would dump someone cheating on me. Know who you are before getting into a committed relationship. Definitively know who and what you are prior to having children. Too many of my gay friends had children and they, their ex's and absolutely the children, pay for the inevitable break up when they finally realized who they were. Spend time finding yourself before diving right into a so-called committed relationship.Side Note 2: I am sad this movie fell amongst the curse of a lot of movies. It's great, excellent even, until it gets too much press. I loved (and still do) 'Titanic' and 'The Blair Witch Project.' I saw them both opening weekends. My opinion never changed as the weeks/months/years passed. I know what I like or what makes a great film. No public opinion will change that. But the curse is, the more exposure a film gets, the more criticism it gets, i.e. ""Oh, I heard it was the best ever! But it sucked!"" You should judge on the qualities, not what your neighbor says.Side Note 3: I was still recently very bitter on the good (but not great) 'Crash' winning the best picture Oscar. I liked 'Crash.' But it was highly unoriginal (even for its time) and 10x less of the movie 'Brokeback' is. Years later, it was reported that the main reason 'Brokeback' lost, was due to the fact that more than half of the Academy voters refused to watch the movie based on the homosexual content. If I hated them before, this was the final nail in the coffin. Each year, I watch all 5 movies (soon to be 10) that are nominated before making my own conclusion of the choices given. If I am unable to do so, I will not make my pick. This is blasphemy, bigotry and phobia at its worst. Though I am saddened, ashamed and disgusted at their inactivity, I finally came to believe that one of the most honored films in history (from all the other awards it won,) it doesn't matter. We'll always have homophobia, as we do racists. Does it make this film any less perfect? No. If anything, it makes me want to find my own soul mate, my own ""Brokeback Mountain"" and disown the select bigots that inhabit society.",Brokeback Mountain
47,Robert_duder,I've seen the powerhouse!!,7,29 January 2006,"Brokeback Mountain is shaping out to be one of the most talked, most influential, biggest film is history. It will likely be a film that everyone will remember hearing about in 10, 20, 30 years...it's everywhere and finally I have seen it and I must admit that after all the hype and constant talk, and bombardment I was a little disappointed. I was expecting to be blown away, I was expecting to slap a huge 10/10 on this and rave away but I can't do that. Don't get me wrong this film is breaking barriers for the gay rights movement, has probably changed the face of film history which is fantastic but for the purpose of entertainment which really is what film making is all about...I was a little disappointed.It wasn't the performances by any stretch of the imagination although director Ang Lee's choices for leads and supporting cast is odd to say the least. But perhaps that's because this film is a very odd stretch for Ang Lee himself. Granted his films often deal with societies barriers on women or other repressed situations which Brokeback Mountain certainly tackles. Heath Ledger in the lead role of Ennis Del Mar performs probably his best acting performance to date (although 10 Things I Hate About You is still amazing in my opinion.) His portrayal of a gay man who finds a soul mate far away in the mountains but then must return to society to marry, have children and struggle every day with being gay in secret. His performance is emotional and moving and definitely the best in the film. Matching that powerful performance is Jake Gyllenhaal who plays Jack Twist, a man who wants nothing more than to be with Del Mar and is willing to give up everything to be with him despite Del Mar's persistence against it. The film follows both men throughout their lives and we see how they deal with being together and apart off and on, in secret for most of their lives. They deal with wives, children, family, jobs everything all with their love in mind. Both men have different ways of showing their dedicated love to each other. Anne Hathaway in a small role as Jack Twist's wife is very good. She completely shatters her Disney image (which the must less impressive Havoc tried to do.) In her very good role as the emotionally estranged wife she does a great job. Michelle Williams also impresses as Del Mar's wife and the only person to really discover her husband's sexuality. These performances are really what are getting everyone talking...that and the content and story of course. The first real mainstream romance film about two gay men. The setting is also beautiful. Mountains and nature and trees and horses, it's a beautifully shot film and kudos to Mr. Lee for that. You can practically feel the mountain air around you.So where does the film fall short. It does drag on. Clocking in at over two hours, the story never really climaxes and it really just repeats itself over and over and over again. The two men meet, go back to their lives, meet, go back to their lives...over and over. The story could have been just as well told in an hour and a half and kept my attention better. Lee also does a great job at telling the story over the course of approximately 10-15 years and Ledger ages remarkably to a believable mid 40's by the end of the film. I admit I have never seen a movie about gay men especially portrayed in a serious way such as this but I can understand some people being taken aback by certain scenes. I think the film purposely tries to be controversial in some aspect with some rather violent love scenes between Ledger and Gyllenhaal. Also certain scenes of nudity seem to be forced and blatant for just that purpose. Other than that the film serves a purpose, has a decent story but drags far too much. Many will see it, everyone will hear about it and it probably will take home some golden statues. Overall see it because I think that it's a historical moment for film and has some great performances but it is NOT the best film of the year by any means. 7/10",Brokeback Mountain
48,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"I'm still glad that Crash won it, but this is still a very powerful and well-made movie",10,16 March 2006,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits In the early 1960s, two men (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllanhaal) desperate for work take a job herding sheep for a demanding employer. In the cold, lonely hills of Brokeback Mountain they are left to fend for themselves against the elements and eventually, with only each other for company, they begin a homo-erotic affair. This goes against both their personas as men, however, and they are forced to confront themselves before both giving in and admitting it is what they both want. As the years after this incident roll by, they become separated only to eventually be reunited. The film charts their fortunes over the years which never shatters the one thing that holds them true: their love for each other.Quite a fuss got kicked up at this year's Academy Awards, when the independent film Crash won over this, Ang Lee's sprawling biopic of homosexuality among cowboys. While I'm glad about this in a way, having finally seen it, I honestly also wouldn't have minded if this had taken away the gong instead, for although a different film entirely, Brokeback Mountain is a hugely recommendable piece of cinema that is not to be missed.It is a quiet and gently noted film for the most part. Ledger and Gyllanhaal are ideally cast in the leading roles, perfectly suited with Ledger as the troubled macho man and Gylannhaal as the more at ease man. Set up this perfectly, they can both turn in excellent, stirring performances.This is presented exactly as the sort of film the Academy likes to give awards to, and at times does appear a bit pompously arty, but when the end comes you are able to wash over the boring bits and appreciate the film as a whole for what it is, especially as the emotionally devastating climax sets in.If you're mature and rational enough to handle the heavy subject matter, you will be able to derive every ounce of enjoyment out of this excellent drama. A must see. *****",Brokeback Mountain
49,ElMaruecan82,We all have a 'Brokeback Mountain'...,10,11 February 2017,"In summer 1963, two young cowboys, Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhall) are hired by Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) to herd his sheep through Wyoming Mountains. Ennis is introverted and laconic, Jack lively and romantic. In the midst of their mission, they discover mutual love somewhere in Brokeback Mountain.The bond is tacit first, but culminates on a cold night where they have sex, in a violent yet passionate way. The day after, they decide to let the matter rest. What happened in Brokeback stays in Brokeback. Yet they can't fool their feelings. Each one follows his path, gets married, has children, but when they meet again a few years after, the joy is so overwhelming they surrender to an urgent desire to kiss each other, perhaps the most desperately passionate of recent movies' history. Then they decide to go 'fishing' in the setting of their previous isolated passion, marking the start of a two-decade secretive relationship. Brokeback becomes the kind of destination inviting you, for once in a lifetime, to be true to yourself. To a certain degree, we all have a Brokeback Mountain.It wasn't my intent to introduce this review with the dull cliché about a place being less a geographical location than a 'state of mind' but this time, it's essential to establish from the start what the film is not: a 'gay cowboy movie', it does feature a love story between two cowboys but the focus isn't on their forbidden relationship. Of course, a homosexual romance in the Midwest or in Texas wasn't the most cheerfully welcomed thing in the 60's and 70's, but Ang Lee isn't interested in the ""message"", this is not a film supposed to open your eyes on homophobia, but just to show how the lives of two persons are profoundly affected by a crucial choice they have made early in their youth: renouncing to their happiness because of social pressure, and affecting in the process other people's lives. The film is full of bad but understandable decisions like life I guess. Life indeed, that's what earns this film its universal appeal, had it focused on homophobia then the two cowboys would have inspired sympathy but not the right one, as victims, we would have true feelings but not strong enough to transcend the 'gay' context. The merit of the Oscar- winning script, written by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana was to create a story where the real suffering was actually self-inflicted. It's all in their renouncement, the fact that these two men, after having what they think is an unfortunate roar of passion, decide to go back to 'normal' lives, and resign to lives that weren't theirs. These are average blue-collar unambitious guys, why should they even dream of happiness after all? But they realize they simply condemned themselves to hell because they regularly have a taste of the very happiness they're missing.Watching the film, I had the feeling I was looking at my own condition, and I thought to myself, anyone who ever renounced a dream to follow the other sheep (I wonder if the imagery was deliberate) until realizing a few years after that he screwed everything, will relate to the story. And reading Roger Ebert's review, I appreciated that he spotted the same thing : ""I can imagine someone weeping at this film, identifying with it, because he always wanted to stay in the Marines, or be an artist or a cabinetmaker."" Count me in the 'artist' category. Through the story of these two cowboys spending their all lives lying to people they love and to themselves, while movies exhilarate the acquaintances with destiny, this one hits a universally sensitive chord because it's about wasted lives.Annie Proulx' wrote a short story that could hardly fit in a film's format, and that inspired the screenwriters the idea to expand the romance over the limits of Brokeback. And that's the element that elevated the film, because from the forbidden relationship between Ennis and Heath, we also see how it profoundly affects the lives of their wives, especially Alma (Michelle Williams) who witnesses the passionate kiss and confronts Ennis about his so-called fishing trips where he came back without fishes, many years later, we can feel the pain of betrayal. A similar scene occurs with a waitress played by Linda Cardellini, who genuinely falls in love with Ennis ignoring what he had inside. Ennis and Jack aren't victims, and they don't enjoy hurting people, but the film makes the right choice of embodying the laconic personality of Ennis and the confusion of Jack, so we can feel their unhappiness from very subtle and silent moments. Indeed, seeing them in their ordinary lives highlight what is truly missing and that's how ""Brokeback Mountain"" displays an astonishing maturity with a relatively simple plot, there's no message, no political statement, it's all in the unseen and unspoken. Although there are a few heartbreaking moments where you have lines that say it all, the most haunting being ""I wish I knew how to quit you"" or when Ennis mentions the memory of his father showing them the corpse of a dead gay cowboy (killed in the most atrocious way), we know it's both an explanation for his tacit nature but maybe an omen for a tragic ending. But this is a credit to the screenwriters to have let a magnificent love story unfold and surprise those who expected the 'gay romance'; the film isn't about homosexuality, but a love that happens to be between men. The script waited for years before being adapted, known as the greatest non-adapted script, as if it waited for the right director. Ang Lee managed to provide some depth and heart in the film rightfully winning an Oscar for his sensitive directing. The talent of Jake Gyllenhall and the late Heath Ledger doing the rest",Brokeback Mountain
50,paul2001sw-1,"Wide skies, deep closet",6,16 September 2008,"Ang Lee's story of gay cowboys, their lives ruined by prejudice won many Oscars, and it's a sensitive treatment that shows how the way we think is governed by the environment we live in. And yet... am I the only person to find that there's something faintly ridiculous about the whole story, it's humourless solidity of terse, emotionally stilted men who turn to each other when, to be frank, it's either him or the sheep? While it's refreshing to see a movie that doesn't translate ""gay"" as ""camp"", this is a portrait of people buried so deep in the closet that they can't see even the faintest crack of light; who, as the film shows it, when they do spend time together, simply sit out under the stars not talking to each other. In some ways, the film does not so much reject myth as blend the stereotype of the western hero with with the conventionally incompatible idea of homosexuality. Real life can hurt, but it's rarely this solemn; and the plot goes nowhere after the premise is established. None of this makes 'Brokeback Mountain' a bad movie; but it is strainingly earnest at times.",Brokeback Mountain
51,MOscarbradley,Ground-breaking,9,1 February 2006,"""Whatever you do, don't call it 'the gay cowboy movie'"". Well, that is what it is and no mistake. And Thank God for it. If it wins the Oscar as Best Picture as expected, it will herald a major breakthrough in Queer Cinema. It's stars and it's director may well be trumpeting their heterosexuality recently but the characters portrayed here, for all the marriages and family business they get involved in, are, at least, bisexual and the all consuming passion in their lives is for each other. The film is infinitely more explicit in reminding us of that than the Annie Proulx short story on which it is based. Proulx's story is a masterpiece of conciseness. Lee's film expands on it way beyond it's boundaries. In doing so, something is gained and something is lost.What is gained is a life for Jack and Ennis outside of the story's insular meetings, in particular scriptwriters Larry McMurty and Diana Ossana, who have done a remarkable job in expanding the narrative while retaining much of Proulx's original dialogue, have given much greater emphasis to the wives the men cannot bring themselves to love and both Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway wrench every ounce of sympathy they can from these roles.What is lost is Proulx's ability to floor you with a single sentence. Passages that, in Proulx's words, are emotionally devastating simply fail to strike the same chord on screen. It is as if Lee can't connect with the feelings he is attempting to portray. The film simply didn't move me.That said, it still has great moments. The long, slow build-up on the mountain is superb. And in these scenes Heath Ledger seems to be reaching deep inside his character, and both actors are deeply convincing lovers and not just in the sexual sense. Butch and Sundance, they ain't; there is fire in their bellies and an extraordinary physicality in their acting, particularly on the part of Jake Gyllenhaal who is a real revelation here, (his would be the most deserving of any Oscars the film wins). Ledger is less convincing in the later scenes, (the director doesn't attempt to age them which is a mistake), and I think he is largely to blame for dissipating the emotional force of the film's climax.It's success, of course, is both welcome and surprising. Welcome in that, at last, mainstream cinema is able to tackle the subject of homosexuality in an honest, unsensational and moving fashion without rancour or shame and find a mass audience at the same time. Surprising in that, essentially, Lee's film is, despite it's length and the breadth of those mountains, an intelligent, small scale, interior piece; an art-house movie that Hollywood has claimed for it's own.",Brokeback Mountain
52,dromasca,just mediocre cinema,4,23 August 2007,"I really do not understand what is the big deal. If this film was not about a gay relationship and if it was not for the controversy that the theme created nobody would have paid attention at best, or would have wondered why such a fine director as Lee or a fine actor as Jake Gyllenhaal became involved with such an average minus film.The story is of a forbidden love as homosexual love is still a taboo from a moral point of view in the US, especially in the conservative mid-West. Yet, it is not an interesting love story, the heroes do not have chemistry, and what looks like an average work and boys relationship suddenly becomes a physical relationship out of the blue and then turns into or the director wants to make us believe that it turns into a relationship. The problem is that nothing int he story justifies this, excepting a vague memory of one of the heroes about his father condemning such relations. So what? Then, the heroes try to get 'normal' lives, which of course are filmed in a banal and boring environment compared to the pure natural environment of Mount Brokeback where the 'love story'happens. Come on, this is a cheap trick! The rest is just soap opera, nicely filmed, well acted by Jake Gyllenhaal especially who hardly can do something wrong, but this is no more than just this - soap opera. The last 15-20 minutes are completely worthless, the authors even ran out of a story.I do not see the value of this film. I saw much better films in this genre like 'My Beautiful Laundrette' for example. In my opinion after the politically correct atmosphere disperses the film will be relegated to the gay relationships films niche.",Brokeback Mountain

Jake G. is really turning into a hot comedy and Heath L. isn't bad himself. The story was interesting, but not that well written. The love story wasn't that moving. I've seen a lot better. The film used the controversy of 2 gay cowboys to get all the media attention it didn't really deserve.It would have been better if it had been under 2 hours. There wasn't enough material to fill almost 2 and a half hours.FINAL VERDICT: It's worth watching just because it's different than most films. Plus, the scenery of nature was beautiful. And the music was graceful as well.",Brokeback Mountain
54,Cineanalyst,Queer Normality,10,23 June 2020,"It's fabulous to reflect on, writing this in 2020, how much has changed in the 15 years since ""Brokeback Mountain"" was released. It was singular at the time as a serious film about gayness that was mainstream, and it's the play on cinematic conventions and normality that is central to its aesthetic quality, as well as its societal influence in broadening the acceptance of homosexuality. There are no tropes of flamboyancy here. No depictions of LGBT political activity and hardly any focus on places where gay men might congregate (the entire nation of Mexico, somewhere in which Jack looks for male prostitutes, coming closest). Instead, it's set in the most iconic of American genres, of conservative rural areas and repressive past times, within heterosexual marriages and families, and at the heart of the country's cinematic formation of masculinity for over a century, the Western. Indeed, it's also part melodrama, even soap opera, and almost Shakespearean tragedy, which largely makes for the picture's emotional appeal. It's this plea to the familiar that made ""Brokeback Mountain"" a landmark in film history. Fifteen years later, as ""Brokeback"" has become slang and lines such as ""I wish I knew how to quit you"" have become infinitely quotable and parodied, let alone increased tolerance of sexuality in the world at large, there may be risk of losing sight of how extraordinary this ordinariness was then.It's there in the cinematography, too. Sure, we see a well-composed cloudy, hillside vista here and there between scenes in the wilderness, but intrusion of pretty landscapes here are reserved for the other side of the postcards Ennis and Jack write to each other. These are familiar views for these cowboys and so become so for the spectator. These are men fully shaped by and belonging to this environment. It's in the populated spaces of the West where they sometimes run afoul, where Ennis fights other men out of his frustration, or where Jack suffers the emasculation by his father-in-law or tries to carefully navigate other liaisons. Probably the most conspicuously staged shot in the entire picture happens at a town fireworks show, the explosions of light and color in the background as Heath Ledger stands over a low-angle shot after he's just got into a violent altercation with two men. There doesn't seem to be any counterpoint shots in the mountains for the pun on ""explosive"" of this shot in town, or even, say, the contrast of Jack riding a bull at a rodeo before shortly thereafter being ridden by his soon-to-be-wife in a car.The acting is remarkable and subtle, too. Yes, Heath Ledger is great, but so is the supporting cast, including as well as Jake Gyllenhaal, the two actresses playing the lovers' wives, Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway. Just as early on, as Ledger and Gyllenhaal's exchange of looks told us all we needed to know about their attraction for each other even before their first sexual or intimate contact, we can see in the faces of Williams and Hathaway how much they know about the affair and how they've coped with it. We see this early on with Williams as a co-spectator to the unfolding romance and how she struggles to remain with us in not interfering or participating in it. Hathaway provides an opposite tract, of a wife seemingly wrapped up in the dynamics of her family business and her relationship to Jack seemingly only extending to his role in raising their son and dealing with her domineering father. But, then, we get that fantastic phone call near the end and an array of emotional indications as to how much she may have known and reacted to it. There's been a lot of discussion, legitimately, about how ""Brokeback Mountain"" and Ledger should've won the top prizes at the Oscars, but the biggest snub is arguably that Hathaway was the only one of the four to not even be nominated.But, back to the men, the Western genre here is key to the picture's take on masculinity. Narrative cinema in the United States was practically founded in the Western with ""The Great Train Robbery"" (1903) and continued through Hollywood churning out B-picture shoot-'em-ups with stars such as Tom Mix performing riding tricks, saving damsels and gunning down other men--all before the likes of John Ford and Clint Eastwood further defined an ultra-aggressive and conservative ideology of manhood on screen, whether by slaughtering Indians, tavern stand-offs, or street duels, in the name of the politics of Manifest Destiny and the rights to and protection of the leading ladies. It's all of that familiar structure that ""Brokeback Mountain"" was intentionally positioned, with a short story originally written by a woman and co-adapted by another, as directed by a Taiwanese filmmaker, Ang Lee, and that is about gay cowboys, one of whom accompanies his wife to see one of those classic Westerns, ""Hud"" (1963), at a drive-in theatre. Sure, they're the ""Marlboro Men;"" smoking, fighting whisky drinkers eating beans over a campfire, the strong silent types, more John Wayne than Judy Garland. That's the point. It's how ""Brokeback Mountain"" upended the entire industry's treatment of homosexuality and masculinity, and it's what makes it, including through the cinematography, a beautiful piece of art.",Brokeback Mountain
55,g-bodyl,Great but Kinda Overrated!,8,20 February 2012,"No doubt about it that Brokeback Mountain is a great, moving film. But should it been nominated for all those Academy Awards? I read that people were not pleased the Crash beat this film out for best picture of 2005. I have to say that as good as this film was, Crash is better.This is about two cowboys who fall in love with each other while tending to sheep and how that love affect their daily lives.Now the acting is the strongest point of the movie. The late Heath Ledger as well as Jake Gyllenhaal gave moving performances. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway could not have been better either! I am not a homophobic or anything but they should cut out one or two of the kissing scenes because it easily distracted me from the movie. The movie would flow better because the story itself is amazing! Overall,this is a very good film but it could have been slightly better. There was a very soothing score that did deserve an Oscar and Ang Lee added a solid movie into his filmography. Also, I should mention that the last few scenes in the movie were absolutely perfect. I rate this movie 8/10.",Brokeback Mountain

However, as the pair of cowboys got to know each other, it became interesting and enjoyable to see their relationship just going from being friends to being lovers. Heath Ledger (god rest his soul) did a very extraordinary job on playing a shy quiet guy who secretly has a big heart. Although you wouldn't think he would be the passionate type as he can be very unpredictable by the way he goes on with things. Also who would't forget the sexy Jake Gyllenhaal? I honestly loved how his character showed so such care and affectionate for Ennis that I wanted to give him a cuddle! Their kisses were just so cute and I wish the pair of them didn't get married to different people, they should've just got married secretly and have each other for the rest of their lives. Unfortunately it didn't happen. It was devastating Jack Twist died from a pair of heartless idiots bashing him to death when his tractors wheel was punctured.

Although technically the movie is about gays, essentially this is a film about forbidden love, with which many of us can identify, regardless of sexual orientation and the specific circumstances of our own experiences. A well-told story, so emotionally charged that it will make even homophobe cry.

59,ironhorse_iv,"I wish I can quit you, movie, but you're just so good to watch.",8,18 November 2012,"I don't see it as a gay or bisexual cowboy movie directed by Ang Lee. I see it as just a romantic movie. For a movie based on bisexual or homosexual love, it's pretty tame compare to the other LBGT movies. The characters don't play on the gay stereotypes, nor does it feed like aggression pro gay marriage movement agenda film. It was suppose to be a low-budget, art house film with no prospect of making any money, but it grew to become of the best romantic movies of the year. The reasons why is the characters and story. In 1963, Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) are hired by Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) to herd his sheep through the summer in Wyoming at a place call Brokeback Mountain. Soon after months being up there, the loneliness kicks in, Jack makes a sexual pass at Ennis, who is initially apprehensive but then succumbs to Jack's advances. Jack's characteristic seems more interested in sex & lust than Ennis. Jack had a history of affairs and sex with prostitutes. Jack then to borderline sex predator at times and more of aggressor of the relationship. Ennis has a clandestine personality. Heath doesn't need to say much to embody the inhibition, inarticulateness character Ennis Del Mar. His character is the key dimensions of this story about gay characters who must keep their sexual preferences hidden in a repressive society. Ledger's subtle facial expressions alternately conceal or reveal his deeper feelings without resorting to words, for he is living a secret. Those depths come out in his facial expressions and body language: dialogue written by screenwriter Diana Ossana & Larry McMurtry helped Ennis restrain his deepest feeling than to verbalize them. Ennie warns Jack that it was a one-time incident, they develop a sexual and emotional relationship. Shortly after learning their summer together is being cut short, they briefly fight, and each is bloodied. After Jack and Ennis part ways, Ennis marries his longtime girlfriend Alma Beers (Michelle Williams) and fathers two children. Jack meets, marries and starts a family with rodeo rider Lureen Newsome (Anne Hathaway). Midwhile, both Ennis and Jack continue to meet each other for infrequent fishing trips. The script and the direction kept a low profile about the events and the characters involved and their lives, so making the underground pain even more explodeable. No much drama exhibition, thus no ""melodramatic' show off, just life, as it would really be under these circumstances. A film almost ""neorealistic"" and therefore painfully touching for the ones who know what living with hidden feelings really means. The ending is one of the saddest pieces I ever witness. Ang's perfection in directing with a style of ""less is more"" causes this movie to seep deep inside of you and it haunts you for days/weeks after wards. While people quote it as a epic Western, I really don't think it's a Western due to two reasons: the story's periodic time isn't 19th to early 20th century, and modernization of the piece. Brokeback Mountain also has one of the best theme song by Gustavo Santaolalla 'The Wings'. Gorgeous and heart warming song that injects an overdose of emotions. Check out the movie. It's not a story of gay love. It's a story of love.",Brokeback Mountain

However, it was still groundbreaking for its time and the portrayal of this life still leaves the viewer with a distinct sense of melancholy.",Brokeback Mountain
62,tomgillespie2002,"A beautiful, heart-wrenching piece of cinema",9,21 October 2017,"It may now be 12 years old, but Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain, based on the short story by Annie Proulx, is still more relevant than ever. At the time of its release, the debate around gay marriage was raging, and continued to do so in the subsequent years. Thankfully, same-sex marriage is now practised in many countries across the world, although it would still be deemed a crime and a sin elsewhere. But anyone who thinks that the themes explored in the film only relate to a relationship between two gay men or women have profoundly missed the point. The story applies to the love between any two people which may be considered taboo, or just plain wrong in society's eyes, whether this be for religious, political or sexual reasons, and this is something that will continue to be a talking point for many years to come.Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) are two down-on-their-luck young cowboys in 1963 Wyoming. They arrive at Brokeback Mountain looking for work, and are hired by the bigoted Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) to herd sheep over the summer months. The work is hard and dangerous, and the pair spend most nights winding down passing a bottle of whiskey. After one particularly heavy night of drinking, Jack makes a move on Ennis and the two make passionate, almost violent love. Aware of society's attitudes towards gay men, the two agree that their relationship must be kept secret and their feelings locked away, and they part ways determined to forget the experience. They both marry (their wives are played by Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway) and have children in the following years, but neither can forget the time spend together on the mountain.Ang Lee's primary focus has always been on character. Even his worst film, the superhero misfire Hulk, spent far more (most would say too much) time concentrating on the human side of its lead instead his angry, green alter-ego. Following Ennis and Jack over the course of a couple of decades, we experience Ennis' inner turmoil and Jack's complete frustration, with the latter's anger stemming from both society's refusal to let them be who they want to be, and Ennis' dismissing of Jack's idea to buy a ranch with him so they can live out their days together. Jack is more accepting of his own sexuality, occasionally attempting pick-ups in bars and often forced to pay prostitutes in dingy alleys. Haunted by an experience with his father as a child, Ennis is in a constant battle with himself. Angry at the discrimination he would face were he display his true emotions in public, and possibly disgusted at himself for possessing such feelings, he stoically drinks and smokes his nights away after his marriage falls apart.The script, by Larry McMurty and Diana Ossana, refuses to over- simplify the characters and force labels on them. It isn't entirely clearly whether the two men are homosexual, bisexual or even heterosexual, as their relationship is built on something far more transcendent. It's one of the many reasons why the film shouldn't be remembered as that 'gay cowboy movie'. Ledger and Gyllenhaal are both terrific, and received Academy Award nominations for their efforts. Ledger is undoubtedly the standout as the buttoned-up, tight-lipped tough guy repressing a range of emotions he doesn't full understand behind his incredibly sad eyes. Tragically, he wouldn't completely shake off his pretty boy image until three years later - the year of his death - after The Dark Knight. It is a film that will no doubt resonate with most people whose feelings fall outside of what society considers the 'norm', and will continue to do so for many years to come. On top of that, Brokeback Mountain is simply a beautiful piece of cinema, with one of the most heart- breaking final scenes ever filmed",Brokeback Mountain
63,didi-5,A slow-burner that lingers long in the mind,7,10 April 2008,"The first mainstream gay western (Warhol's 'Lonesome Cowboys' can only be described as niche or cult), 'Brokeback Mountain' was the surprise hit of 2005, another triumph for the talented director Ang Lee (who also gave us such diverse films as The Ice Storm, Sense and Sensibility, and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon).Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) are the cowboys who start working together and find an intense sexual attraction which will continue to burn for twenty years. The film covers those two decades as we watch the idealistic Jack, who dreams of acceptance and a life with Ennis out on the ranch, and the tormented, disturbed Ennis (who remembers gay cowboys being murdered in his youth), who can't connect with anyone and anything other than his lonely soul.Extremely slow in pace, and all the better for it in an age of fast, rushed films for the MTV generation, 'Brokeback Mountain' is a love story just as valid as any other. For a mainstream movie to even address some of the issues looked at here is amazing, and the film benefits from sensitive direction, low-key romantic scenes, and total commitment from the leading actors. Gyllenhaal is better than he was in 'Donnie Darko', but he is overshadowed by Ledger, who shows here what a fantastic actor he was. It is a tragedy that his early death has robbed us from seeing this talent grow. Here in this film he resembles a young James Dean in 'Giant', playing older than his age with ease.Not an easy film to watch, then, but it repays close study and patience, and some of its lines and images will stay with you for a long time after the credits roll. Proof that intelligent cinema can still survive in the age of blockbuster action flicks.",Brokeback Mountain
64,johnnyboyz,"The real tragedy may well be that what ever happened on Brokeback, was only ever allowed to stay on Brokeback.",8,28 May 2008,"Much nearer the end of Brokeback Mountain when a revelation occurs, someone receives it from down a telephone. We do not see the revelation, we merely hear of it like another said character does. The film does not stop what it's doing and cut to the revelation in order to show us and it does not give us that experience of the films final action within its final act. Instead of showing us, it 'informs' us of the event and then allows us to come to terms with it in our own way. For a split second, we are the character on the phone nearer the end since as soon as they first hear of it, we do and that is the cue to accept. There is no glory and there is no obvious closure, just a scene 'about' a scene and that 'less is more' phrase works so, so well in this instance.One of many reasons Ang Lee picked up Best Director Oscar for Brokeback Mountain, I think. The film covers such a vast period of time and feels as epic as it looks and yet it probably never even expands beyond a radius of fifty miles. This is a film about a certain sort of person, living within a certain timeframe within a certain society. In decades from now people may well be labelling this as some sort of birth of the American period drama. The film absorbs its audience with a story about love and in some regards honour but also tells of the hardships and demands this (and every) society wishes upon its people. Throw in some brief nods to Freud's thinking that the film-maker's absolutely nailed; some interesting scenery; two dynamic acting performances and a narrative that is both unpredictable and unconventional and yet equally interesting and you have the ingredients for Brokeback Mountain.Right from the very off the film announces in a covert and unsuspecting manner that it will break away from convention. This is a love story people that inhabit the world in which both Ennis (Ledger) and Jack (Gyllenhaal) would call 'unconventional' at the very nicest and the film is anything but conventional. The archetype of the cowboy is one that has been set in stone for decades; that one of hard bodied, male, masculine and upstanding. Here the cowboys and the figure of the cowboy is rendered the opposite, homosexual. The men when we first see them are tentative, shy even. The early exchanges out on the mountain are awkward and somewhat unspectacular but the director allows his film to simmer; he allows his characters to develop and get a feel for their new surroundings before they enter a new lifestyle.Then there are the tiny details regarding both character's childhood and parents. A scene is set aside for Ennis to describe what happened to him and his parents when he was younger and I believe this lack of a father figure perhaps shaped the way his young mentality developed. Equally so, Jack's bedroom we learn was always kept like it was when he was a boy suggesting the parent's inability to move on; to develop and to ultimately let their son go  this can have serious repercussions on a young adults mindset. So these characters of Ennis and Jack are not mere pawns in a large, obligatory-laden and melodramatic game of chess but are indeed people written, expanded and then thought through with the question 'How did my characters get to this position in the first place?' But the film does not stop around about there. There are the others things to weigh up such as the fact both men sort of admit to one another that neither of them are, in fact, entirely homosexual. This scene comes as a bit of a surprise or perhaps it is included to make evident both men, despite what has happened, want to retain a certain 'butch' status. Maybe the writers including it says more about them as both men have respective scenes later on in their marriage where authority is stamped in a macho and 'typical' cowboy fashion: Ennis takes on and knocks down a rough looking guy at a fireworks display and Jack goes against his family in-laws in having on an American football game during dinner at the most heightened of situations.But these scenes do not occur sporadically as random passages of violence. Indeed, no cowboy in this film is going to punch someone so hard that they'll fly through a wall. The superegos omitted by Jack and Ennis happen only when their wives and children are present and either insulted or belittled  it is that un-denying feeling of love and/or affection that sparks the reaction and that is something that both men cannot control when they are together much later on in the film: they cannot control their affection for one another and react accordingly, most would say 'unconventionally'. It is ironic that a film loosely about a homosexual male couple would portray women in such a negative light. Most are seductive and do not wear much with others looking for mere foot massages and a flirtatious dance while one other is shown as one that keeps talking and in an unintelligent manner. For what it is, Brokeback Mountain is an intriguing unpredictable tale set in a world that would not accept its protagonists for what they are.",Brokeback Mountain
65,Red-125,Of Mice and Men revisited,7,8 July 2006,"Brokeback Mountain (2005), directed by Ang Lee, is based on a New Yorker short story by E. Annie Proulx, and has a screenplay by Larry McMurtry. Although Lee is Chinese, he appears to have a good feel for the western U.S., and, of course, both Proulx and McMurtry have demonstrated their expertise in portraying this region.The story is well known to everyone--two young men have a same-sex love relationship that persists after each has a wife and children. The point of the story is that this love is difficult to display in the best of circumstances, and impossible to display in their circumstances.The problem with this film for me is that the only memorable aspect of both men is their love for each other. Other than their hidden love, they don't demonstrate any positive characteristics--intelligence, honesty, or kindness. Each man makes his wife unhappy, and neither is a satisfactory parent.The tragedy of this film is that two lives that could have been happy are robbed of the possibility of happiness. This reflects a societal problem that I consider a disgrace. Moreover, their unhappiness causes unhappiness in others that spreads out in a ripple effect. One problem for me is that I thought the film was uncharitable to both wives. The film presented them as obstacles to happiness, while I thought they should have been considered as victims of the same forces to which their husbands were subjected. (Incidentally, Michelle Williams was outstanding in the thankless role as one of the wives.)Brokeback Mountain is an important movie about an important theme. However, I would have enjoyed this film more if it had been about characters for whom I had more affection.",Brokeback Mountain
66,filipemanuelneto,Interesting but too slow.,4,18 January 2017,"This film addresses a homosexual affair between two cowboys. Although the press and the gay-friendly publicity tried to sell the idea that it was a true homosexual romance, I was not convinced. Watching the film, I found that the script suggests something different: two lonely men whose unfulfilled emotional needs lead to a homosexual affair, despite their marriages and individual commitments. There is no love in this. The film is essentially about doubts, unfulfilled emotions, moral and emotional conflicts, the breaking of taboos and the consequences that it has afterwards, in the life of the one who did it. In any case, it is undeniably one of the most remarkable films of Heath Ledger's career. The actor deserves applause for his work in this film, where he dominated and stole the limelight from his own colleague Jake Gyllenhaal. This actor, for his part, has always been much more obliterated and the way he interpreted was not so interesting or consistent. Ang Lee did a decent job, but he seemed to be particularly focused on giving the film a good scenery and cinematography, with great success in that. Even so, the result of his work was a lukewarm, slow-paced film, and that makes it annoying, cutting off the connection between the audience and what they're watching.",Brokeback Mountain
67,howard.schumann,An intimate and complex human drama,8,9 January 2006,"""We kiss in a shadow. We hide from the moon. Our meetings are few and over too soon"" - Rodgers and Hammerstein (The King and I) Based on a short story by Annie Proulx and adapted by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, Brokeback Mountain is the heartbreaking story of the unfulfilled love between two men set in America's contemporary West. Directed by Ang Lee and beautifully shot in the Alberta Rockies by Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, the film has an epic quality, but is also a very intimate and complex human drama. While Brokeback Mountain is, in some respects, a classic love story with its nostalgia for the defining moment of first love, it is also the first mainstream film to depict gay men without exaggerated effeminate characteristics and to convey the rampant homophobia that exists in Middle America.Set in Wyoming in the early 60s, Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) meet when they are both young ranch hands working together protecting a flock of sheep in the Brokeback Mountains. One is garrulous and outgoing, the other inarticulate and repressed. Heath Ledger's performance has been critically acclaimed and it is strong. He captures the confusion, the longing, and the profound sadness of a person who has been living a lie. Though proclaiming they are not ""queer"", the two men form a relationship that expresses itself in a sudden physical intercourse (surprisingly without any normal first-time experimentation). They have no language to describe their feelings but know that something vital has taken place and that their lives will never be the same. Separated at the end of the summer, the two men go their separate ways, trying to hold their affair as an insignificant blip but knowing otherwise.Jack marries Lureen (Anne Hathaway), the daughter of a wealthy farm-equipment salesman and Ennis is married to Alma (Michelle Williams), a convenience store worker. Both have settled into a conventional lifestyle but as the years pass, in spite of wives and children, their inarticulate longing for each other has not disappeared but has grown more solid. After four years, they meet again. When the two men embrace and exchange kisses by the side of the house, Alma catches a glimpse of their passion but is shocked into a silence that remains over the coming years. As the two camp out in the wilderness, Jack suggests they leave their families and live together on a ranch, but Ennis is unwilling to commit to the potential danger that such an arrangement might entail, recounting a story about a rancher who was dragged to his death because he dared to live with another man.Over the next two decades, the lovers meet as often as they can as Ennis tells his wife he is going on fishing trips, a story she suddenly rejects during a Thanksgiving dinner. Eventually, Alma divorces Ennis because she cannot confront his double life. Instead of providing an opening for a commitment to Jack, however, their love remains unattainable because of money problems and fears of homophobic reprisals. Though the ending has an undeniable power, I did not experience any deep connection with the characters. I understand the limitations imposed by the restricted emotional range of the men in the novel, yet the fact that neither developed very much in the way of conversation, understanding, or intimacy over a long period of time did not enhance my emotional involvement with the film.Although the mincing stereotypes have disappeared, they have been replaced by regional stereotypes as well as by tight-lipped cowboy ""Marlboro Man"" stereotypes. Sadly, the women are little more than ciphers, defined only by their long-suffering relationship to their husbands. While many tears are being shed (justifiably) over the men's lives of isolation and unfulfillment, let me also shed a tear for the wives who expected love and commitment from their husbands, and for the children who will grow up without a father figure to nurture them.Nevertheless, Brokeback Mountain's importance as a cultural statement cannot be denied, and those involved with the film should be acknowledged for their courage. While it is an honest film that may act as a catalyst for change, it should also be noted that there are no gay people involved in the project, no gay actors, producers, or directors and that coming out in Hollywood still means the loss of key roles for most actors. Even if change in people's attitudes does not happen overnight, however, the film will strike a responsive chord with those who have gone through life hiding their true feelings, and may bring the day one step closer when they can ""kiss in the sunlight and say to the sky: ""Behold and believe what you see! Behold how my lover loves me!""",Brokeback Mountain
68,TheMovieDiorama,Brokeback Mountain delicately illustrates a rocky relationship.,8,6 April 2018,"Consistently referred to as the ""gay cowboy"" film, a description that acts as a disservice to what is a much more emotionally involving drama. Two young men are recruited to wrangle sheep in Brokeback Mountain over the winter season, where their friendship rapidly escalates to a forbidden platonic relationship. Acknowledging the tricky situation, they both decide to resist their hearts and lead normal lives where they start families. Controversially, this is renowned for losing the Best Picture award to 'Crash' and I can now understand the outcry. This is an intricate romance that feels both selfish and sorrowful. Two individuals that inflict damage upon the ones that love them and themselves. Falsifying love in an attempt to live as happy families ironically cause them self-destruction, but the screenplay gently explores the reasoning behind this. You gain an understanding as to why they made these choices, even though they are both hurting themselves, which consequently allows emotional attachment to the story and characters. Following typical western genre traits, the pacing is perhaps excessively leaning towards the slow side (especially the first thirty minutes), however it allows the characterisation to seep through the dialogue and compliment the natural beauty of Wyoming's mountainous landscape. Lee's direction is purely focused on the actors, ensuring that their talent is at the forefront. Both Gyllenhaal and Ledger were absolutely outstanding as Jack and Ennis, their chemistry was beautifully enigmatic. The internal torment and sorrowful friendship that blossoms is often spiky as it is loving, yet at no point is it conveyed falsely. The highlights and low points were progressed with natural humanity. Williams and Hathaway in supporting roles also enhanced the ferocious onscreen talent as two wives that inevitably feel betrayed. I did find the scene where Gyllenhaal violently drags a sheep by its back legs as distasteful. However, this is a majestic romantic drama that is as feral as the rodeos it portrays.",Brokeback Mountain

70,funkyfry,"Nice movie, very poignant",8,1 March 2010,"The people who made this movie should be praised for not giving in to the apologetic and self-righteous tone of so many ""social progress"" movies we've seen since the birth of cinema. Unfortunately some of the stylistic choices like the steel-guitar heavy soundtrack make it a bit too sincere for its own good, and there is a kind of pleading quality to some of Lee's scenes.But for what it's worth, Ledger and Gyllenhaal are tremendous in the film and hold the entire package together. I found myself quite torn up by the story, after having laughed off some of the early scenes as a bit too much or too precious. There's a tasteful rhythm to the thing once it gets going, and Lee allows Ledger a long leash which Ledger does not abuse with his astonishing performance as the self-tortured silent type who holds the relationship back from becoming official. Gyllenhaal does a good job of portraying someone who is more open about his emotions, but still afraid to tell Ledger about his affair with another rancher (he tells his lover that he's having an affair with the man's wife instead). This is where we realize Ledger's character has only been able to live with the romance up to this point by considering it a ""special"" relationship between the 2 of them; the idea that Gyllenhaal's character might be with some other man is disastrous to him, and he even threatens to kill him.The female characters are only spectators, and their role is fittingly smaller. Anne Hathaway did not impress me, didn't seem like any kind of Texas rural type at all. Michelle Williams did better with what she was given, and grabs a bit more of the audience's sympathy.I don't have that much more to offer, except that I'm glad for the most part the movie avoided a ""shock effect"" that seemed obvious in the subject matter, and instead treated its subject with integrity. This isn't the story of gay love, it's a story of gay love. It's not really about sex, but it doesn't shy away from sex. It's a powerful portrait of how love is crushed not so much by ""society"" as by our obedience to society, our repressed fear and anger. In that respect it has more in common with, say, James Ivory's ""Remains of the Day"" than it does with activist ""gay cinema"" which is usually much more concerned with bringing about a resolution of the conflict between society and individual that always feels contrived in this still-sore area of social conflict.

Due to their confusion about their feelings, and the views towards homosexuality at the time the pair split at the end of the summer and go on to marry and start families miles apart. The pair however meet up for liaisons a couple of times a year, under the guise of fishing trips and though it continues to affect their lives, time and tradition means they're unable to make a genuine commitment to each other.This is one of those times where I'm going to have to give up my bona fides and just say that, although the performances from the leads and the supporting cast is excellent, I found ""Brokeback Mountain"" to be rather a long and dull affair. It's a touching and realistic romance between the two men, but also the effects that their love has on their traditional relationships with their wives and children. However, I'm a big story guy and ultimately there isn't a whole lot of story here.I'm not blind to how significant the film was, the important strides in representation that have been made stem from films like this being such a mainstream hit. I'm also not blind to how sad it all is, particularly given Heath Ledger's subsequent untimely death.

I mean, in the year 2006, people are mad because a movie comes out that they don't have to see about a couple of dudes.I went to a local theater with a friend of mine to see it, having found that it was finally playing in Cincinnati. Up until the day before, I was constantly checking theater listings here on IMDb and finding that it was playing almost everywhere, except for southern Ohio, not to mention a few of the southern states. I was excited going to see it, finding an incredibly long line of people leading into the theater.I was enjoying the movie until, fifteen minutes into it, a voice sounded over the entire theater. It boomed, ""Attention, attention, attention. There has been an emergency reported. We ask that everyone please evacuate the theater through the exits on either side of the screen."" And so, we all evacuated. I'm wondering whether or not it's a fire, but when I saw three fire engines, three ambulances, and an uncertain number of intermittent police cars, what other conclusion could I draw than the likely possibility that it was a bomb threat. I'm sure there was no bomb, but the theater has to follow procedure. They have no choice. I went to see it again the following week.Cincinnati is not the only place where we have to worry about the desperate, inexplicable measures of religious or political fanatics whenever we want to see a movie. In Salt Lake City, it was banned. They claimed that they didn't want children to see it and be influenced by the homosexual activity in it. However, they are letting Hostel play there. You remember in Hostel when those people were mutilated with chainsaws and that guy held a blowtorch point blank in that girl's face, baking and disintegrating it? Why are these people not worried about their children being influenced by the gruesomely sadistic activity in Hostel?It's difficult to be influenced by homosexual activity. Homosexuality is a natural sexual orientation. A gay person is born attracted to their own sex just like a straight person is born attracted to the opposite. It's naive to say that homosexuality is a choice. Try it yourself just to make sure. Let go of your inhibitions and choose for a day to be attracted to your own sex. Try to fantasize about them. Even try hitting on them. Unless your are naturally attracted to men or women, you won't truly be.Look at it in terms of common sense. Who would choose to be gay? Being straight is safe, because that's what the majority of the population is. Being gay is a much harder life because you have a much smaller number of people to choose from, and you're constantly oppressed, perhaps even beaten to death like Matthew Shephard. Which would you choose?Oh, and by the way, remember Bound? It's another great movie with two gay protagonists. However, they are lesbians. Do you recall this much protest at any point with Bound? No. So let me get this straight. Girls having sex with girls is cute. Guys having sex with guys only gets them the attention that Mr. Shephard got in Laramie. Huh. Well, I must say, that boils it down to incredibly self-centered and ignorant male-dominated society, not to mention a pathetic weakness and insecurity in men that almost makes me ashamed to be a man.Brokeback Mountain is one of my favorite films now, and it really stimulates emotion the way a love story is supposed to. Ang Lee's brilliant direction keeps the film at a steady, constantly brisk pace at the same time it keeps the film in a low key, in a calm, docile mood, no matter how jarring or tear-jerking it can be.If you want to knock it for having gay guys in it, go ahead and knock all the other gay guys in history: Tennessee Williams, Margaret Cho, Christopher Walken, Joe Pesci, Nathan Lane, Stephen Sondheim, Edith Head, Alan Ball, Gus Van Sant, Alan Cumming, Walt Whitman, Jean Cocteau, Alice Walker, Charles Laughton, Nigel Hawthorne, James Ivory, George Cukor, Billie Holiday, Tchaikovsky, Jean-Michael Basquiat, Francis Poulenc, Anthony Rapp, ad infinitum.",Brokeback Mountain
73,thinker1691,A Mountain of Memories,10,6 April 2006,"It isn't unusual to see a film surpass what viewers expect of it. Truth be told, audiences enjoy it. Such is the case with Brokeback Mountain. This is the unexpected story of lonely people in search of a special dream. What is not expected is that they are American cowboys and are gay. Touching off a firestorm of controversy, this film is the first of what many believe will be the next barrier in the long history of prejudicial cinema. Years ago, Europeans ventured into this forbidden niche and established a precedent which up until now, American film companies have been reluctant to address. With the incredible talents of Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar and Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist the US has not only responded and shattered conventional wisdom, but offers perhaps the finest film of it's genre. Brokeback mountain is a story of two men searching for companionship and love. Unexpectedly thrown together by their search for employment, the two reluctantly accept ranching duties in the high Alpine mountains of Wyoming. There amid a vast wilderness, tending sheep and reflecting on their dreary lives, Ennis and Jack accept their solitude and quickly learn they are drawn to each other. Neverthelless, their conventional world defies, tugs and tears at their burgeoning affection for one another. Both men feel passionately, yet realize their forbidden affair could easily rip apart their facade of masculinity. Eventually, over a period of twenty years, they learn to deal with friends, families, and social pressures as their secret begins to evaporate. Emotionally charged and deeply touching in every respect, the film presents audiences with a portrait of fading Americana, amid changing seasons. All in all, a courageous attempt to mirror the life and loves of a reclusive aspect of the American cowboy. ****",Brokeback Mountain

75,freemantle_uk,"I am just a cowboy, lonesome on the trail",8,21 August 2010,"Brokeback Mountain is derogatory called Bareback Mountain by American Conservatives (the type of people who want to hold America back socially). These people obviously do not understand that Brokeback Mountain was more then 'the gay cowboy movie', but a powerful tale of forbidden love and the changing nature of rural America. Ang Lee, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal do a terrific job with this film.Starting in 1963, ranch hand Ennis del Mar (Ledger) and rodeo cowboy Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal) who work together on Brokeback Mountain, Wyoming to herd sheep. There are alone in the mountains and of course they become friends. But after one drunken night Ennis and Jack have sex, and but Ennis warns Jack it was a one time incident. When the two split Ennis marries Alma (Michelle Williams), fathers two daughters and becomes a general labourer. Jack becomes a rodeo cowboy and marries rodeo princess Lureen (Anne Hathaway), the daughter of a wealthy man and the two have a son. But the two cowboys are continually drawn to each other, going back to Brokeback Mountain for 'fishing trips' and their families suffer because of it.Brokeback Mountain is a powerfully acted film, with great performances all round. Both Ledger and Gyllenhaal show why there deserved an Oscar nod each and why there were the greatest actors of their generation (Ledger untimely death a tragic lost to the work of acting). Both Ennis and Jack are two very different characters, Ennis being hot-headed, with a temper and seems to denied what he really is. He is a loving father, but suffers financial issues and is trapped in a loveless marriage, to a woman who suffers because of his hollow feelings. Jack on the other hand is more accepting about his feeling, though has to keep them hidden because of the nature of his environment: he willingly goes into a relationship with Lureen and the two seem to have a more healthier relationship, but he has more need for contact with other men. Both are believable and the situation is made out to be real. It is how a closet relationship work functioned and that what you would expect to be the most manly men can harbour feelings for each other and do not fall into the stereotype of what gay man would be. The other relationships are handled with great skills with the writers and Lee understanding human psychology. All the characters are well drawn and complex, with it easy to feel sorry for Ennis. But I would have like to have seen more of Jack and Lureen's home live.Lee directs with great skill, using excellent cinematography and an understated, simple score by Rodrigo Prieto and Gustavo Santaolalla to great effect. Lee shows the isolated nature of the mountain, beautiful, but cold and serves as a metaphor for both the characters as their relationship. It serves as both everything good and bad about them. Lee captures this area and period of America really well, showing that it period of change and that work of cowboys was changing and dying to be no more then a show act. He could have shown more of the conservative nature of areas of Wyoming and Texas and more ideas about Homophobia, but you can't have everything. Lee also follows a very simple rule of direction, show, don't tell, allowing the audience to see the emotions of the characters, using little dialogue for many moments of the film.A very good film that is more the 'gay cowboy movie' and a great way to say stuff you (because it's IMDb I can't use any harsher language) to American Conservatives of the Sarah Palin model.",Brokeback Mountain
76,Polaris_DiB,An achievement in its own way,7,27 February 2006,"Two cowboys in Wyoming are just looking for work when one day they happen to get the same job herding sheep about Brokeback Mountain. For a while it's a day-in, day-out job as they slowly get tired of beans, but then, one cold night, they get a bit drunk, they get a bit confused, and the next thing you know they're in love but don't know how to deal with it. The story follows their lives over the years as they try and manage families, keep their secrets, and yet still find time to see each other despite living in different states and having completely different lives.It's a slow, but beautiful build-up to their relationship, and then once it gets its momentum and finally starts moving, the film just gets better and better. Compliments, of course, are towards the performers (including the supporting actors) and the direction, and a lot of this films mythic quality is on the absolutely gorgeous shooting of the Brokeback Mountain area, the only really open area shown in the film--obviously because Ennis and Jake feel rather restricted by the normal world around them.It's a good conceit, and a good theme, and tales of forbidden love and social commentary are great too. Unfortunately, this movie isn't free from its moments of camp... like in the tent, when Jake and Ennis are looking at each other and I couldn't help thinking, ""But baby, a man's got needs!"" Or the shot of the gutted sheep, and all the time it allows around it for one to think, ""Well ain't ever'one feelin' gutted today?"" Or when Jake and his wife are out with the society couple and the woman is talking about ""Men never ask their wives to dance,"" and of course the obvious response would be something like, ""Well that's 'cause I want to dance with your man!"" I'd cite more examples, but I'd neither want to spoil it or completely ruin it for you, for afterall, unintentional humor aside, the story just keeps getting more and more involving until it finally hits it's real stride, with some pretty unforgettable moments and unforgettable emotion. Thus it is, in its own way, quite an achievement. Even nice little touches like the fireworks behind Ennis when he gets angry at the bikers and some rather abstract shots in the beginning keep this film engaging enough to ask us, gently, to have patience with it until it gets to where it's been meaning to go.--PolarisDiB",Brokeback Mountain
77,dfranzen70,"Dreadful, and a disgrace to taboos",2,17 February 2006,"The story of a long-time romantic relationship between two cowboys should, in a perfect world, be a beautiful tale. It should show that despite the taboo of same-sex relationships, love and compassion can reign supreme. Instead, we're stuck with a deadeningly dull piece of slop that would put any sentimentalist to sleep if there weren't so many goshdarn panoramic views of mountains.Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis del Mar (Heath Ledger) are itinerant cowpokes who sign up to herd a mess o' sheep across Brokeback Mountains, and during the long drive, they fall for each other. Only it doesn't happen gradually, it's lust at first sight, after a cold night in a hot tent up in the mountains. After that, it's decades of pining and not immediately getting what one wants.I honestly believe that this movie has been such a big hit (critically and commercially) because of its same-sex theme, rather than because of its, oh I don't know, good acting or script. The plot is exceedingly simplistic; it's so easy to follow, you'll be able to predict the next scene with ease. But because the two principals are men, suddenly what's such a humdrum story ascends to an exalted level of genius.Make no mistake, it's a pretty picture to look at, and I do recommend watching it with the sound off. Maybe you love lovely scenery - there's a lot of gorgeous setting. Or maybe you're a straight woman or gay man and think Ledger and Gyllenhaal are hot hunks. With no sound, you'll be very happy. Turn the sound on, though, and you'll quickly realize there's no there, there. The problem with being a Beautiful Person on the outside, of course, is that people often assume you're a dullard inside. When Ennis or Jack speaks, there aren't pearls of wisdom that come dropping out; no, they're more like balls of silt, spoken either sotto voce or outright mumbled, the better to fame the words as Profound. There's nothing profound about the movie, other than the vast infinity of the untamed mountains.The movie perks up only when other actors show up. Randy Quaid has a few short scenes, and he easily outacts the younger leads. Michelle Williams, who plays Ennis's wife Alma, and Anne Hathaway, who plays Jack's wife Lureen, light up the screen when they're there, showing more vigor and passion with the hook of an eyebrow than either of the lunkheaded leads can with every expressionless countenance they can conjur. Ledger, who seemed to be channeling Steve McQueen's look, mumbles incoherently through much of the movie; this was partly owing to the chaw in his mouth (I presume), but still - when trying to be Profound, it is wise to be Understandable.I believe that this movie was swept up in hype, as people were first astonished at the man-on-man sex scenes (which looked and sounded as loving as a rape scene, although I'm no expert on gay sex scenes) and then proud of themselves for deigning to watch it. It's a real shame a taboo like this couldn't have been broken by a solid, adult film instead of the crappy, one-dimensional clichés and characterizations that screenwriter Larry McMurtry came up with; somehow, in the world of this movie, laconic equals deep.",Brokeback Mountain
78,ianlouisiana,A sad film about the destructive power of love.,7,27 September 2008,"""Brokeback Mountain"" is a sad film about the destructive power of love. The danger of making a movie from a short story/novella with an explicit homosexual storyline is that - given the potentially enormous audience base as opposed to a relatively small readership for a cultish author - the work may be hi - jacked by those with a different agenda and used for their own political purposes. Thus ""Brokeback Mountain"",the movie,has been declared by many as a ""Gay Masterpiece"",a revolution in film - making and ""Empowering"" for gay men. And it is of course none of those things. By setting it in the last year of the Kennedy Adminstration we are dealing with the mysterious past for most of its target audience.But even in repressed old England attitudes towards homosexuality were relaxing as a result of a wider general tolerance for individual sexual freedom as exemplified by the ""Lady Chatterley"" trial when Penguin Books were acquitted of obscenity charges at the Old Bailey. 40 years later the battles have been won.This is reflected in the fact that apart from a few rumblings from the Fascist Right and the usual protests from the Bible Belt,the movie passed unscathed through mainstream theatres throughout the U.S. and Europe.It is preaching,then,to the converted.Not a revolution,a re - affirmation. Gay men and women do not need ""Empowering"" - a patronising concept at the best of times - they have the same civil rights as everybody else. They do not have to use separate washrooms,sit in the back of the bus,eat in ""Gay Only"" diners,they are not discouraged from voting..... to compare the treatment of gays to the treatment of black people is insulting to one faction and condescending to the other. What we have left in the movie ""Brokeback Mountain"" relieved of its baggage is a very sad tale of two men who fall in love and because of the moral climate of the day are forced to live a lie.The tragedy is not only theirs but more so their wives.Two totally innocent women who,all unknowing,are being used and deceived by the men they love.All those lives ruined.If it had been made in 1964 the movie would have indeed been revolutionary,daring and sensational.By 2005 it is merely a look back to an age when the love that dare not speak its name still dared not speak its name.Now,perhaps,there are no more Great Causes for movie makers.",Brokeback Mountain
79,PWNYCNY,Ennis - the new hero,10,1 March 2006,"I'm trying to figure out what is the purpose of this movie. I watched the movie and afterwards asked myself: What is this movie about? What was the director trying to prove? What new theme was Hollywood trying to exploit to make an extra buck? Two men have the hots for each other? So what? That they try to conceal it from their families and friends? What else is new? That everyone in the movie kinda knows what's going on but really don't say anything? Okay. So ... what's the point? Two pals ... who are more than just pals. One dies ... the other is left to cope with the loss, a loss that he cannot discuss with anyone because to do so will reveal the kind of relationship they had, a relationship that was considered taboo. To me, when the movie ends is when the movie should have actually begun. Usually, I don't endorse the use of flashbacks because flashbacks tend to muddle the continuity of the story, but here a flashback right at the start of the movie would have been wonderful: a middle aged man looking out of window, seemingly at nothing, but consumed by thoughts and feelings that he cannot share, that must remain within him forever. What is he thinking about? And why? Anyway, the movie is worth watching. Heath Ledger offers a great performance as a quiet man who's in conflict with himself and with society, a middle of the road rebel who must restrain his innermost feelings in order to survive in an unforgiving society that will reject him and ostracize him if he ever fully reveals his true self. Ennis is the new hero.",Brokeback Mountain
80,dee.reid,"""Brokeback"" - Between the two horizons, the greatest love story ever told",10,4 April 2006,"""Old Brokeback got us good and it sure ain't over.""Jack Twist, ""Brokeback Mountain"" (2005)Brokeback Mountain ""Brokeback Mountain"" gets us good too.As a straight African-American male, I never thought I'd be showering praise over a movie about two cowboys in love with one another. Regardless of one's political leanings or religious convictions, it's hard to not find ""Brokeback Mountain"" to be a dark, painful journey of love and affection. It's been billed as a ""gay cowboy movie"" but that's just a ""cruel simplification"" - Roger Ebert. To me, they aren't gay but are in fact very much straight, and hopelessly, desperately in love with each other.Most would think Hollywood has lost its mind by electing Taiwanese filmmaker Ang Lee to adapt E. Annie Proulx's short story, which first appeared in The New Yorker in 1997 and has won dozens of awards including the prestigious O. Henry Prize, to the big screen. But upon closer inspection, Lee is perhaps the most qualified person for the job since his career has been made by showcasing people trying to function outside the norms of their society.Beginning in the summer of 1963, Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) are the two ranch hands hired by Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) to herd sheep on Wyoming's Brokeback Mountain range. Both men seem to be opposites, though the only thing they really share in common is the fact that they're both around the ripe age of 20. Ennis has lived with a troubling memory since boyhood in which one of two men living in an old shack was found beaten to death. Ennis's father had conditioned him and his brother to hate homosexuals; the irony is, to hate gays, he would be forced hate himself. Still for all he knows, his father did it.Ennis is of so few words that Jack is able brag that when he relates the story of how he was raised by his brother and sister and when they went off to get married, he was left by himself. Jack is a rodeo rider with little or no family ties, and seems more able to face the fact that he may be inescapably gay and in love with Ennis. For Ennis, it's more difficult.While on old Brokeback, the two go about their chores, herding the sheep, eating cans of beans on end, and spending lonely nights on opposite ends of the range. So when the two get pissy drunk one night, they passionately, almost violently have sex. The next morning, they're frank: Ennis says, ""You know I ain't queer"" to which Jack replies, ""Me neither."" Of course in the big picture, that's exactly what they are.At the end of the summer, they part ways and the most they can get out of one another are generic send-offs like ""Like what are you doing later?"" and such. Before arriving on Brokeback, Ennis was already engaged to Alma (Michelle Williams) and upon his return they get married and have children. Jack continues rodeo riding and meets the pretty Lureen (Anne Hathaway), who's the daughter of a rich farm equipment salesman and they have children of their own.I don't need to hint upon the controversy surrounding ""Brokeback Mountain"" and its suspicious loss of Best Picture at the Oscars earlier this year. Watching this, I got the strong feeling that somehow that neither man is ""gay"" in the sense we know - they don't know themselves, and I don't either really (so excuse my earlier presumptions) - and the movie makes it abundantly clear to us the audience.Take away the two men in love theme, you're stuck with just two people sharing a forbidden relationship over the course of a lifetime, but don't know why they're in love. I recall last year about some of the marketing strategies for theatrical posters and Ang Lee and his team suggested riffing on ""Titanic"" (1997) and other classic romances - just with Ledger and Gyllenhaal sharing the title. Had the story been about a heterosexual couple from a different cultural, ethnic or religious background, I doubt the film would have received as much praise or controversy.The cinematography really makes the wide, open area of Brokeback Mountain shine and glisten and provide the characters and us with an overwhelming sense of freedom, as Ennis and Jack sometimes retreat there on ""fishing trips,"" reliving that special summer from '63. Both Alma and Lureen get suspicious that neither of their husbands bring back any fish on these ""trips."" But both men embrace passionately after long absences from each other's company, and that makes this love much more powerful.The script by Larry McCurtry and Diana Ossana puts Proulx's short story under a microscope and highlights the love, pain, and despair of this great forbidden love between these two fellows who are in love and don't know what to do with it, much less try to remain happy in their separate marriages to kind and caring wives.There is something about one of the film's closing scenes, where Ennis retreats to Jack's family's house and goes up to his bedroom. We get to see Ennis reclaim a piece of their time together and ""Brokeback Mountain"" seems to end on a note of optimism, something I really think the E. Annie Proulx short story opted out of. But between the two horizons, ""Brokeback Mountain"" may very well be the greatest love story ever told to a mass audience.10/10",Brokeback Mountain
81,meeza,Cowboy Hats off to Brokeback Mountain,8,7 February 2006,"""Love is a force of nature"" is the acknowledged tagline of the critically acclaimed Ang Lee film ""Brokeback Mountain"". However, ""Mother Nature"" nor in this case ""Gay Father Nature"" could have predicted that this little independent film about two Wyoming ranch cowboys who endure a twenty-year old secret romance would create such a cinematic force. ""Brokeback Mountain"" will undoubtedly ride off with numerous Oscar golden boys; come on, those gay cowboys sure like those shiny naked boys. Brokeback Mountain is an incandescent film that contains one of the most breathtaking cinematography I have ever seen in a motion picture. The musical score of Brokeback also successfully juxtaposes the narrative's reticent themes. Heath Ledger turns in a remarkable performance as Ennis Del Mar, the taciturn cowboy who marries his accommodating country gal Alma. Michelle Williams' work as Alma was one of the ""Alma Matters"" salute material. Both are deserving of their Oscar nominations. Jake Gyllenhaal, plays Gay Cowboy #2 Jack Twist. He is the most unrestrained of the two who desperately pursues a committal romance between Ennis and him. However, the real ""twist"" of ""Brokeback Mountain"" comes in when ""he will be coming around the Brokeback Mountain when Ennis comes"". Gyllenhaal also scored a Best Supporting Actor nod for his affectionate performance. Anne Hathaway plays Lureen Newsome, Twist's imperious wife who probably should have looked at his ""Gay Cowboy Diary"" instead of her ""Princess Diary"" to seek the truth what got ""Jack off"". Director Ang Lee's film 'which could have easily been titled ""Crouching Cowboy receives Hidden Dragon"", was really a lucid film about forbidden love in a stillness environment. Lee's efforts are commendable. The only area where I have to say ""hold your horses"" and say that is was overrated is in the film's lackluster screenplay. Let's just say that ""I could quit that type of wordage."" Nevertheless, this film is picturesque, thought-provoking, and revolutionary enough for me to get on my high horse and recommend ""Brokeback Mountain"". **** Good",Brokeback Mountain
82,Chris_Docker,The mountain of our fears and dreams,8,16 January 2006,"There's something about mountains  the way they inspire us, fill us with hopes and dreams. Is there anyone who hasn't stood at the foot of a mountain as a child and not imagined climbing it? Lush green valleys seem to promise happiness, and the hills beyond are aspirations, symbols of a soaring spirit and also the challenges by which we measure ourselves.Set in the verdant pastures and breathtaking mountains of Wyoming, Brokeback Mountain is a symbol of an enduring dream, a happiness that might be out of reach, of lakes and sunsets, of campfires and sheep farming, of flickering flames and a life away from the hustle bustle, where a can of beans and fresh coffee span a deeper range of existence than the materialism of the city, and where a person can get in touch with their soul . . .Our story starts with two men taken on as sheep herders in 1963, regular guys that need a job. One of them is planning to be married soon. They become fast friends but soon discover more about themselves than they were prepared for  and far more than the local community can live with.Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) divide the work up between them, one of them sleeping on the land to protect the sheep overnight and the other riding back and forth with supplies. So far the film has blended the idyllic lifestyle of westerns with a slightly more modern setting  reminiscent of early Marlboro cigarette advertising. What follows is a brief scene that explodes and causes many people to either be shocked (especially fundamentalist Americans apparently) or simply say 'not the sort of subject matter that interests me'. As there's no way of avoiding the information by way of the advance publicity, it makes no sense not to tell you that the two men have sex with each other  but simply that for once do believe the reports that have given this movie outstanding acclaim worldwide, and go to see it not because it happens to include a couple of gay cowboys but because it is a monumental film in itself.The Romeo and Juliet plot (two starstruck lovers from different social groups kept apart by family prejudice) has been almost exhausted; the not dissimilar starstruck couple here though are kept apart by social prejudice alone (extreme homophobia that includes gruesome torture and murder - although these details, thankfully, are hinted at rather than conveyed too graphically).What is fascinating (to a mainstream audience) is the way the people in their lives deal with it. The wife who knows but pretends it isn't happening, the other wife who lies, the children who grow up presumably in the dark but still attached to their loving father, and finally the parents, whose tender acceptance, in spite of the upset they probably feel at the knowledge, quietly puts their son's happiness first. While covering the extreme stereotypes of prejudice, director Ang Lee (Sense and Sensibility; Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) has wisely avoided simplistic reactions in the supporting characters. The finely nuances performances allow us to see many sides of the moral dilemma without once making judgement.Breaking stereotypes is also the order of the day for the two lead characters, who enjoy much of the macho rough and tumble associated with the heterosexual male (especially the whip-cracking Texan, or full-bloodied Australian: European, Asian and Latin American men seem to find less need for such demonstrations to assert their sexuality, perhaps because homosexuality is better integrated and respected in these cultures). Neither of them are particularly camp, and would both be identified as straight on a casual glance. (""You know, I'm not queer!"" says one, the morning after  ""Me neither!"" the other replies.) This must be particularly annoying to American cultures that cling to such outdoor archetypes as 'heterosexual'. But Ang Lee, an outsider in America, has bravely represented a minority that still carries more social stigma than colour, much to the shame of a country that claims to be the greatest country in the world. An even bigger achievement is that he has achieved it as a mainstream movie, and one that may well go down in history.When the sheep season ends the two men continue with their separate lives, but meet up again four years later (the phrase ""just going fishing"" may never be the same again). They realise the hopelessness of their situation but cannot bring themselves to discard it either. When one of the wives spots them in a brief and covert embrace outside, we know that disaster looms  the only mystery is what form it will take. The movie unfolds with incredible grandeur amidst the torn-apart emotions of all those involved, condensing a story of a considerable number of years without ever rushing it. Perhaps the one weakness is that it never tries to advance our understanding directly  and none of the characters are particularly blameless role models  but in confining itself to telling a story it perhaps reaches out for understanding better than any claim to moral high ground. The cinematography is remarkable, never flagging, and juxtaposing awe-inspiring images in a way that conveys a deep sincerity for the subject matter. There are mountains to climb. and mountains that represent ideals to work towards, or simply molehills that seem like mountains until we can open our eyes and conquer our fears about different lifestyles. The small journey to see Brokeback Mountain could be the small step to better understand our humanity to others.",Brokeback Mountain
83,MaxBorg89,A painful masterpiece,10,30 January 2006,"I have to admit, when I first heard this movie was getting made (December 2003, on Italian TV), I never thought I would see it, as the idea of watching a ""gay Western"" wasn't that appealing (actually, I wasn't a big fan of the Western genre in general back then, but that was before I saw Dances with Wolves and The Searchers). Then I heard it had won the Golden Lion in Venice, whereas everyone thought the award would go to Good Night, and Good Luck. And now it has won four Golden Globes and will most probably get this year's Best Picture Oscar. Yes, it is that good, and I don't regret I finally went to see it.The film is directed by Ang Lee, a filmmaker who can seamlessly move from a genre to another and make an excellent picture (his last effort, Hulk, suffered from some bad SFX, but otherwise it was an interesting film). Brokeback Mountain is no exception, in fact it's arguably Lee's best movie ever, beating even Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It's a gripping, heartbreaking, painful film, and labeling it as a ""gay Western"" is to entirely miss the point. It's a love story, and a very universal one, which just happens to involve two men.The story begins in Wyoming, 1963. While shepherding on the titular mountain, Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) develop a friendship which eventually leads to a night of brutal, almost animal sex. After an embarrassing exchange (""You know I ain't queer"";""Me neither"") , the two men part and don't see each other again for four years. When they finally meet, they're both married (to Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway respectively) and have children, but the passion they've been holding inside them for so long is still there, and for the following twenty years, they occasionally return to Brokeback, in order to freely express that passion.The movie's greatness lies in its honesty, the forbidden love story at its center being so pure and touching, you don't care that the love-birds are both men. It's a doomed, tragic romance, which won't last forever, even if Jack wishes it could be so.Pain, honesty and sadness permeate the entire movie, and they're obvious in the flawless performances: Michelle Williams is astounding as the faithful wife who suddenly bursts out in panic as she discovers the truth, and Gyllenhaal is amazingly perfect as the idealist who wants more than ""a few high-altitude f**ks once or twice a year"". But it's Ledger who surprises more than anyone with what has to be his best performance to date: a conflicted, brooding individual who chooses to hide his true emotions until it's too late. This is one of those cases where a single look is much more powerful than all the words in the universe.I really hope this masterpiece will get the recognition it deserves at the Oscars. In my opinion, the best picture of 2005, as well as one of the best films I've ever seen.",Brokeback Mountain

85,noralee,"One of the Saddest, Most Heart Breaking Romantic Movies Ever Filmed",10,19 December 2005,"""Brokeback Mountain"" is one of the saddest, most heart breaking romantic movies ever made, without a drop of sentimentality or ounce of schmaltz.Director Ang Lee has created a direct descendant of John Ford's seminal Westerns. While filmed in Alberta standing in for Wyoming, rather than Ford's usual Monument Valley, the gorgeous landscape (credit to Rodrigo Prieto's lovely cinematography) and endless horizon of isolation recalls a West where John Wayne tried to shoot Natalie Wood for transgressive fraternizing in ""The Searchers"" and the men of ""My Darling Clementine,"" etc., were only free outdoors, beyond the confines of civilization. The camera adores the two handsome Marlboro Men at the center of the story from first shot, and throughout, as we see them draped over trucks, sheep, horses, campfires and each other.Enlivened by terrific acting, Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana's screenplay adaptation of Annie Proulx's short story manages the difficult feat of communicating raw emotion through essentially inarticulate characters who first don't understand their feelings and then have no words to express them. Jake Gyllenhaal is almost as adorable as ""Jack Twist"" as he was romancing Gwyneth Paltrow in ""Proof."" Even though his aging hair and make-up defeat him visually for a human saga that extends over 20 years (as well as Anne Hathaway's who literally ropes him into being her spouse), his growing maturity and self-realization is demonstrated to be hard-won. While we have seen the anxiety of the third leg of a triangle many times in stories of adultery or intermittently requited love, Gyllenhaal wears his passion, joy, hope, affection, longing and desperation on his face so transparently that the audience cannot help but be drawn into his palpable pain. But Heath Ledger takes conflicted masculinity to a new level, in a way that ""Jarhead"" scrupulously avoided. As one of the aggressive women in their lives says in frustration as to why she's now with a new beau: ""He even talks."" Ledger's ""Ennis Del Mar"" drawls a concession of ""Guess I wasn't much fun."" Her tearful riposte: ""Don't you understand that a woman doesn't fall in love with fun?"" He creates a complete, taciturn, repressed, confused character from a hardscrabble life who tries to force himself to accept being fenced in by the strictures of Western expectations and codes of conduct towards both men and women. His character is totally overwhelmed when his feelings are unleashed and collide, and yet, can shine with exquisite tenderness in sweet romance. His performance leaves the audience exhausted in its pathos. While I've been a fan since his teen acting days, his brief scenes in ""Monster's Ball"" only hinted that he was capable of this depth. He embodies tortured loneliness who has to sacrifice too much to learn that no man is an island. The film is movingly sensitive to the women in their lives and very sympathetic to the women being hornswoggled by adultery where they least expected it. Michelle Williams is a whirlwind as a naive girl who grows into an exhausted working mother suddenly faced with an explanation for the jarring disconnect in her marriage that will always be there through their shared children. (The men take seriously responsibility for procreative sex.) Her interactions with Ledger, in and out of bed, build to fraught climaxes.The musical leitmotif of the central relationship is repeated operatically relentlessly. The country music jukebox selections are adequate (Tammy Wynette's ""D-I-V-O-R-C-E"" is a bit too obvious a choice), though the tracks on the soundtrack CD are beautiful but not apparent in the film. Over the credits, Willie Nelson croons a lovely take on Bobby Bare's traditional ""He Was A Friend of Mine"" that ironically segues into Rufus Wainwright's ""The Maker Makes."" And when I got home the first song that popped up on the radio was Aretha Frankin belting ""I Never Loved A Man (The Way I Love You)"" which seemed even more appropriate.",Brokeback Mountain
86,davispittman,Get the tissues ready!,10,9 June 2016,"Brokeback mountain is the heartbreaking story of two gay cowboys who secretly carry on a relationship for years and years. This is truly the best LGBT film ever made, it is captivating, well acted, beautifully written, and well directed by Ang Lee. The two main actors the star in this are Jake gylanhall and Heath ledger. The movie starts out with them meeting one summer to work and ranch on Brokeback mountain, and there that's where their bond and connection begins, I cannot even begin to say how well Jake and Heath pulled this off, especially as two straight men in real life, in my opinion they were both cheated out of their Oscar wins. The connection and the romance that they share together is so real and so captivating to the audience, although Heath's character is so scared to be himself and is so scared he might be judged by society that he will not enter into a full on relationship with Jake's character, Jack. They both go their separate ways and eventually both get married to women and have children, but while they are married and living their lives, they still meet secretly on Brokeback mountain to have ""fishing trips"". That is what is so heartbreaking about this film is that they clearly want to be together and are in love but their lives will not allow them to be together fully. Also Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway are both so real and so incredible in this movie. They both deliver top-notch acting performances. This movie teaches that society must accept people that are different, the LGBT I mean, because truthfully if society and people wouldn't have been so judgmental than the two main characters probably could've lived together happily forever. Unfortunately towards the end of the film a tragic event happens and Jack dies. I do think that this was a clever good ending, no it is not a happy ending but it is still a clever one. This is truly one of the best films ever, and if you are a parent of a 16 or 17- year-old teenager, then I would strongly suggest watching it with them. Yes, there is one gay sex scene, but it is not long and it is not graphic, this movie truly needs to be seen by everyone. And if you don't agree with homosexuality, than this movie might just shine a different light on it, and it might make you have second thoughts about it. 10/10!",Brokeback Mountain

89,EUyeshima,"A Soaring Ledger Emboldens Lee's Powerful, Evocative Portrait of Self-Limited Destiny",10,12 December 2005,"It shouldn't surprise anyone that the opening weekend in San Francisco was completely sold out for this much anticipated film. I just read the brief, wondrous novella by Annie Proulx a couple of weeks ago, and despite its wellspring of emotion, the 55-page book didn't seem like a natural candidate for screen treatment, especially one with a running time of 134 minutes. What is most intriguing about director Ang Lee's 2005 cinematic adaptation is how it builds upon the elliptical nature of Proulx's narrative into something quite transcendent and relevant beyond urban, flavor-of-the-month movie audiences.Thanks primarily to an extremely perceptive screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, the much-discussed gay romance is not what separates this film from others but rather the penetrating depiction of the barriers that keep the two cowboys apart. As Lee has proved in previous films that go beyond his cultural identity, he can take what seems to be a niche subject and turn it into a love story with universal appeal to anyone facing an inhospitable environment. I join the chorus who feels it would be shame if potential viewers skip this movie on the preconceived and misbegotten notion that it is simply a ""gay cowboy"" romance.Initially set on the mountain of the movie's title in Wyoming, the plot focuses on taciturn ranch hand Ennis Del Mar and animated bull-rider Jack Twist, both hired for low wages to herd sheep during the summer of 1963. One cold night, after we see several scenes where they get to know each other and acclimate themselves to their roles, they enter reluctantly into a passionate tryst. While the more open-minded Jack is excited by the feeling of liberation, Ennis is steadfast in his self-inflicted shame and rejects Jack's dream to own a ranch together. Having witnessed as a child the remains of a man lynched for carrying on a gay relationship, Ennis is afraid of the same fate. However, they both recognize an intractable bond that they try to ignore with great futility.Four years elapse, during which time both get married and have children. Ennis marries longtime sweetheart Alma and raises two daughters. Jack has since moved to Texas and married Lureen, the daughter of a big-time farm equipment dealer. He decides to come back and visit Ennis, and their pent-up passion is sparked and becomes unbridled. They begin to take romantic getaways together for the next two decades under the guise of fishing trips. A twist of fate brings Ennis an open resignation to his unresolved feelings even as his now-grown up daughter attempts to get to know him.The performances are uniformly strong. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Jack in his familiar, wide-eyed manner since it fits his character's more idealistic personality, though he becomes marginally less convincing when he ages. As the wives, both actresses are removing the shackles of previously limiting roles. A graduate of the TV teen-angst soap opera, ""Dawson's Creek"", Michelle Williams continues the promise she showed in Thomas McCarthy's ""The Station Agent"" by revealing the increasing pain and unrelenting sadness in Alma, alternately realizing and denying what is going on between Jack and her husband. Anne Hathaway seems to be jettisoning her goody image from Garry Marshall's ""The Princess Diaries"" in a hurry as Lureen - first as a feisty rodeo girl not afraid to get sexually aggressive with Jack and then in a series of unfortunate blond wigs (from Farrah to Loni Anderson), as a savvy businesswoman growing indifferent to her husband's lack of attention. It's the smallest, least developed part of the four principals, but she makes her moments count.However, it is Heath Ledger who amazes as Ennis. This heretofore almost strictly commercial actor has tapped deeply into the agony of his character's soul with authentic force and poignancy. It's a career-defining performance of a man who cannot let his internal stirrings affect his outward appearance. It's Ledger who makes the intimate scenes between Ennis and Jack seem so desperately charged with emotion and regret. Smaller roles are filled expertly - Randy Quaid as the suspicious sheepherder boss; Linda Cardellini - completely unrecognizable as bespectacled Velma from the ""Scooby Doo"" movies - as the waitress who tries hard to bring out Ennis' heart; and Kate Mara as Ennis's loving daughter. The panoramic vistas of Wyoming (actually Canada) are provided by Rodrigo Prieto's stunning cinematography, and the evocative music score is by Gustavo Santaolalla, who did similarly stellar work in Walter Salles's ""The Motorcycle Diaries"". I am hopeful there is a broader audience than the enraptured critics, as the rest of us are also being rewarded with a superbly executed film.",Brokeback Mountain

91,Boyo-2,"There's this, then there's everything else",10,24 December 2005,"No one has seen anything like this before, so of course I haven't either. That fact alone makes this stand apart and above everything else. Add to that the idea that more people will most likely experience this as their first 'gay-themed'(even though it is not, not really) movie, and you're breaking new ground again. On top of that, it just so happens to be a really excellent, thoughtful, impossible-to-forget piece of cinematic magic.First I have to give it up for Ang Lee. I really admire an artist who cannot be pigeon-holed. As much as I love a lot of directors, a lot of their work is obvious, and 'been-there-done-that' is the tired expression that comes to mind. We've seen it before. They repeat themselves and are more than a little impressed by their own style. Lee does not have a style that's his, he creates it based on the project. He can excel in any genre and already has. Verrrry few people can go from ""Sense and Sensibility"" to ""The Ice Storm"" to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" to ""The Hulk"" without missing a beat. Then he makes ""Brokeback Mountain"" and I, for one, am in awe of his talent and willingness to do something unlike everything else.*Remember you were warned about spoilers!* Seeing Ang & Heath on 'Charlie Rose' gave me insight that I was glad I had before seeing the movie. Ang's comments about Lurene's conversation with Ennis about Jack's death were very helpful, even though I would have figured it out for myself, it was nice to have it confirmed. Ang said she's lying on the telephone, and he didn't say why she would do that, but anyway...Heath's saying that Ennis was a 'homophobic man in love with another man' summed up his character in one sentence and made me realize how he saw Ennis. He also gave some insight into the idea that believed Ennis was never attracted to another man in his life, and probably not a woman either for that matter, but that he fell in love with a person who happened to be a man. This theme is very seldom explored in cinema because I think an extraordinarily large amount of people never consider that as a human possibility. Its really not a 'gay-themed' movie any more than its a movie about how to herd sheep or how to easy it is to get sick of eating beans.I have to say I agree with those who say its Heath's movie. It is true. He's quantum, he's in a place all by himself. He's the emotional core, which is strange since he's so far from expressing his feelings that it isn't even funny, but somehow he pulls it off. Its a perfect example of the more-is-less school of acting. Any character that says as little as he can get away with but at the same time provides the entire movie with its heart...In fact all the emotion you feel comes from a very pure place. Its not manufactured by the soundtrack or some cinematic trick or anything..its just there and it never rings false, a true feat in itself.Michelle Williams in particular broke my heart. I'd only seen here in ""Dick"", a largely ignored comic masterpiece of a movie, and she's 180 degrees from that. She hits all the right notes.Jake is always great and the Thanksgiving scene with the battle over the television was so well done that I thought about that damn electric carving knife all day today. From his point of view, it may be unfair that Heath is getting all the press and praise, but let's face it, at least 80% of Heath's scenes are with Jake, so if he hadn't been as good as he is...There is also not one single scene that I'd cut, and I can't say that about every movie. Most movies have fat on them to spare, this does not. You get enough, you don't get too much, and then its over, and you're left remembering this simple yet profound story for the rest of your life.As far as awards go, I'm THISCLOSE to giving up hope that I'll will ever agree with the Oscars again. I've been disappointed much more than I've been in agreement. I am glad this movie has won all the critics awards; they don't have a sense of obligation or nostalgia or politics, it seems to me, and award movies that they just happen to think are worthy. I haven't seen anything else this year but from what I've read, I don't see what can beat it.10/10, obviously. If you see this and do not, at the VERY LEAST, admire and respect it, then I have to say, I don't understand you...",Brokeback Mountain

93,pachara87,"Arguably Ang Lee's best film, this swooning, achingly sad near-masterpiece offers a universal love story that lingers long in the mind",9,13 January 2019,In 1963 Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) show up penniless at a Wyoming ranch to look for work. The strangers are quickly assigned to herd sheep together on Brokeback Mountain. Be it the pristine setting in which they live sleep and work together or the appearance that they're practically the last two people left on earth something draws them together and before long they share a tent and a raw liaison. In order to keep their jobs they know they must keep this secret affair just that and must decide on a larger scale whether or not to embrace their emerging love. Over the next 20 years the two men-almost as if by familial rite of passage-marry and become fathers but find themselves drawn back together. But can they ever find the happiness they shared together on Brokeback Mountain in the real world? Be prepared for at the very least an Oscar nomination for Ledger who painstakingly embodies the plights that his character would actually face. The plights for a gay cowboy stuck in the most unforgiving of cultural and societal climates are many and well could there have been a tougher character to portray this year save for Johnny Cash and Truman Capote? Which is certainly not to take anything away from Gyllenhaal's work here (or in Jarhead)-Jack is more willing to submit to the love reducing his character's complexity but not the actor's dramatic fireworks which are nothing short of captivating. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway co-star as the cowboys' wives possibly deserving of Oscar nods of their own had their roles been bigger. For director Ang Lee Brokeback signals a dazzling return to his roots. Don't let Lee's Hulk aberration fool you for this is a daring director who helmed The Ice Storm and Oscar-winner Sense and Sensibility. Brokeback finds Lee dissecting the humanity and the lack thereof in a relationship that goes beyond mere gender. But more importantly he explores the threshold of the alpha male as an incorrigible creature. The film is also stunning almost hypnotizing visually with much of the story unfolding against the lush nature of Wyoming. And the score by Gustavo Santaolalla befits the ambiance perfectly without ever being intrusive. All in all the film could've stood to trim a few minutes but it just might be Lee's best to date. (Plus expect a major boon for the fashion industry as hipsters might again be sportin' skin-tight cowboy duds-and boots-in '06!),Brokeback Mountain
94,triple8,Brokeback Mountain- a moving and powerful film.,10,8 January 2006,"SPOILERS THROUGH:I'll start by saying right away that Brokeback Mountain is a haunting, touching and powerful film. I have no doubt this film will win many awards and it should. I'd been looking forward to it and luckily this is one that did not let me down.I hate to echo a line that so many others have already said but it happens to be true so I will. This is SO MUCH more then a ""gay cowboy"" movie which is what many have pigeonholed it as. This movie is about the love between two men true enough. But it contains so much to it. One does not need to be gay to appreciate this. However, if one is bothered by the subject matter or does not like dramas, love stories, period films or films with a western theme it is probably not for them.To me Brokeback Mountain is about love yes but also innocence. Jack and Ennis are two men both played with enthralling intensity by Gylanthal and Ledger, who have loved each other and gone on to make other lives for themselves. Their lives are full, if not happy ones but as time goes on, it's clear to these men and to the audience how one summer on Brokeback Mountain has shaped them and how much they mean to each other. This is really a movie you feel as well as see.Brokeback Mountain is not fast moving, it does not get in one's face with it's forcefulness, to the contrary the movie moves extremely slowly and just sort of starts to envelop you in the lives of the people on the screen, their sadness, longing and dreams. It's subtle, quiet and touching. It is powerful. It makes you cry but not in the way certain tragic romances do, although there is certainly tragedy involved here. But this is a more quiet and almost mysterious kind of powerful. Nothing's milked, it kind of just appears on screen. The movie is always quiet and vibrant as a summer's breeze. It's bittersweet.Ledger and Gylenthal are both simply incredible. In their performances and their scenes together, they are able to show a large range of emotions as we see these individuals experience so much. We see love, passion, anger, tenderness, yearning, playfulness and friendship. Those are the things that this movie is about.There are certain scenes in this movie that need no dialog as they are tenderly touching in and of themselves. One example is when Ennis dissolves into tears in Jack's arms. Another beautiful scene enfolds as these men play together and jump into the water on Brokeback Mountain. And at the end in a very intense moment, Ennis clasps Jack's shirt and smells it. These scenes tell as much about these individual's relationship as any line of Dialogue.My one complaint isn't with the film, it is that Gylenthal is not getting the buzz that Ledger is and that should not be the case because he is outstanding and as good as Ledger. I first really took note of Gylenthal in ""The Good Girl"" where I found him incredible but in Brokeback Mountain he is even better then that. Gylenthal's Jack inspires so many emotions and with Gylenthal it's all in the eyes. There are certain performers who can convey as much with their expressions as with any dialog and that is the case here. Gylenthal is a gifted and Brilliant actor and is certainly destined to leave a strong mark on the world of cinema.Ledger too is wonderful but he has been getting so much buzz it's almost not necessary to say that. There were certain things I'd have liked to see in Brokeback Mountain, more of Jack and Ennis's relationships with their wives for one, as well as pumping up the volume a bit-it got kind of difficult to understand every line of dialog sometimes. I still think that it's one of the best films of the year.And of coarse there is the brilliant direction by Ang Lee and the almost unreal,untouched beauty of Brokeback Mountain. This movie may haunt afterward and for people who WANT to see this, one thing it probably won't do is disappoint. My vote's 10 of 10.",Brokeback Mountain
95,onepotato2,It's nice enough,7,27 February 2006,"The state of drama today is frustrating. The Academy has proscribed a certain tasteful treatment of topics, with high-production values and the thrust is always ""We should be more thoughtful and polite to (the hyper-intelligent, the sub-intelligent, the misunderstood criminal, the underdog, the outcast, gay cowboys)."" Every recent drama can be inserted into that sentence. Even if I agree with those sentiments, it doesn't mean I want to sit through ensuing groups fed through the formula; or that I'm satisfied with that narrow recipe for drama. Life and people are deeper than that rubber-stamp allows. It's tiresome. Brokeback Mountain is the next entry in that contest. It's the kind of issue movie that the Academy loves.As far as drama goes BBM is at the rather simple end of the spectrum. The plot is as modest as this kind of movie event can bear. You've already imagined all the scenes that it could possibly cover before you go see it. It suffers from a few small problems; increasingly bad aging make-up and a peculiar stingy, puritanical need to move critical bits of drama offstage at odd moments (usually reserved for movies directed by Robert Redford). And a major flub in which a character dies and the the sub-text receives a confusing, inept visualization not in the main viewpoint of the movie. It had my crowd asking ""Who the hell's viewpoint was that?"" I thought it would skimp on scenes where love grows from small bits of intimacy, but they're here and they're nice. What it does skimp on is the female characters who receive token coverage and have nothing to do.It's what the culture needs right now; an utterly safe polite movie about the topic. If it wins the academy award it's going to have the kind of shelf-life of something like Guess who's Coming to Dinner. A look back at it from the future will present a pleasant, mild curio that wasn't as important as it seemed.Dramatically it has some ""Oh Come on!"" duds like Jack popping his wife in the butt. Mmmm. how literal. And the fact that Ennis doesn't even know the sightlines of his home that offer enough privacy to make out. I expected to dislike this movie but I didn't. Heath Ledger is quite good. It's a nice movie. It lacks a climax. But it's still in my head after two days.",Brokeback Mountain
96,EdgarST,Cowboys Also Cry,3,9 June 2012,"""Brokeback Mountain"" was released six years ago, and although I found it a deceitful concoction when I first saw it, I had never wrote anything about it until today. I doubted my first impression, because of the many prizes the film had won and the possible validity of the argument that ""so many people cannot be wrong"". But yes, many people may be simultaneously wrong, if one just thinks of all those who thought that our planet was flat. The film is not without values, mainly for responding to the need of visibility of the homosexual population: although it is not a self-representational product, it is a valid effort to make a vehicle that is neither a comedy of mistaken personalities nor proselytizing pornography. The film also celebrates physical love in open spaces, intimacy in communion with nature, something that has been mostly enjoyed by heterosexual couples stranded in paradise islands ""a la Blue Lagoon"". The problem with ""Brokeback Mountain"" starts with the artistic resources used to validate the sick behavior of a man, and have the approval of the audience, so everybody would enjoy a nice, long cry for the last 30 minutes. If it is only for the good use of very manipulative melodramatic effects, the script deserves all the prizes it won. In my case, I cannot help wondering if it is ethical asking of us, out of compassion (more akin to sentimentality than true pity), to side with Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger, in a great performance), a monster who, by the end of the film, has left behind a long chain of broken hearts, including a dead man: Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal), supposedly ""his true love"". For almost 90 minutes, ""Brokeback Mountain"" elaborates a character's biography to justify the reactions and answers of this being with such a peculiar name as Ennis Del Mar (maybe that's where it all started). An orphan raised by his brothers, taken out of school and a virgin, he has his first sexual experience with young cowboy Jack, without ever forgetting a childhood incident, when his father took him to see the dead body of a homosexual cowboy that was murdered by emasculation. Ennis hardly moves his lips when he talks, he is in constant denial, he is violent, paranoiac, possessive, jealous, he does not know how to dance (I remember in my old Psychology text books, that in the old days dancing was a requisite to reach maturity!), he does not travel, he is reduced to his little world, is afraid to face his own life and destiny (""Leave Texas"", advises Jack to deaf ears), he imposes his rules in their relationship, and ends alone and a fetishist. On his part, Jack, a promiscuous alcoholic, is murdered, surely by any of those men he would pick up in the streets to satisfy his unsatisfied sexuality. The succession of traumatic events obviously turns Ennis into a suitable case for psychological treatment, and to take it out on him would be as vile as his own acts. However this is fiction unceasingly asking that we spectators opt for false compassion, as a result of manipulating elements to make him seem only a victim. With the possible exception of his daughter, all the women in this film are either passive, gooey, negative, or weak. Ennis treats them all badly, without even having to touch them. His wife has the good sense of asking for a divorce, but she lives in resentment for all the abuse she was subjected to. Outside his hometown, Jack's mother has her own husband to treat her bad, and Jack's wife is a cold, calculating woman. Ennis' marriage life is hell when compared to his lyrical escapades with Jack to Brokeback mountain: the babies constantly cry, a night of fireworks with the family ends in violence, the presence of his daughters create a little chaos in a supermarket; while in Jack's place, the relationship with his father-in-law explodes. In two or three occasions when Ennis' sickness is evident, the script ""cures"" him, as in the climatic scene when Jack, a few months before his death, rebels against the life of sex three times a year. Ennis threatens him, they embrace and then cry, with their knees on the dust. Suddenly and with no cinematic differentiation, a flashback shows them tenderly in love, sweetening the violent and dramatic moment that has just taken place in the present. It is necessary to stress that Jack is as sick as Ennis, but his drama is secondary, a mere cue in Ennis' psychological map. In short, this story of a peasant whose stubbornness and neurosis turn everybody's life into a mess, seems to be the closest to what the Hollywood industry would give us homosexuals on our own sexual orientation, and to what any audience would endure as ""serious drama"" on the relationship between two men: an aseptic film about sex (more than love), with little eroticism, where the only nude scene is by a woman. As Robert Altman used to say, the best part of a story begins when the motion picture is over. So quite probably in imaginary sequels, Ennis' daughters, as products of such a dysfunctional family, would become a transsexual and a vengeful prostitute, while Jack's son, with a similar background, would become the town sissy or the new diabolic politician of the state. There were other American films in 2005, more attractive than this one, and more deserving of our free time, as ""Sideways"", ""Broken Flowers"", ""Syriana"", ""The Squid and the Whale"", ""The New World"", ""Sin City""... On the homosexual subject there have been productions from all corners of the world, including ""Plan B"" from Latin America, ""Happy Together"" from Hong Kong, and so on. All of them are far more interesting than ""Brokeback Mountain"". A lot more.",Brokeback Mountain
97,nycritic,Finally A Film Which Gets it Right,10,12 January 2006,"It was only time before a film about two men in love would get the treatment it gets in Ang Lee's BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, since up to now, films had either skirted the subject, reduced it to a peripheral, sanitized version of itself or given it the eye-candy treatment only meant at making a quick impression in the ""Gay-Lesbian"" category. The simple yet deceptive story of two people who meet, fall in love, but are unable to fulfill their love has been done over and over again from the male-female perspective (i. e. IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE, THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, BRIEF ENCOUNTER), but never involving two men, and never this brutally honest.Of course, the dynamic of male love is different than male-female love only in genitalia. Jack and Ennis' first encounter while waiting for work, their isolation leading to each other's arms, is the stuff of every restrained romantic drama. The mechanism of two men falling in love here develops along the lines of homo-masculinity dictating patterns of behavior which both Jack and Ennis obey whether they know it or not. It comes to me as no surprise when, following their first sexual encounter (brutally executed with undertones of sadomasochism but true to the style of love involving alpha males), they revert to ""not being queers"" but cowboys who excuse ""what happened"" to liquor and ""manly needs"". Which of course verbalizes society's impositions of men having to be ""men.""Of course, things take a different turn and the heart wants what it wants. Once their work is done, Jack tries to keep their acquaintance alive but Ennis is so intensely closed and closeted to any possibility of emotions that he looks like he may implode at any moment and only once does he actually scream into his hat, bent over, as Jack drives away. The sound is a terrible, heart-rending puke of indescribable pain.What follows is a series of brief encounters that become more intense as the years go by, but at the same time destroys two marriages and consumes then to the end. Love is an uncontrollable emotion, and when two people who belong together despite their gender cannot fulfill their dreams it's only a matter of time when things reach a head. Again, the constraints of time and space interfere: Ennis cannot see a life outside what he knows, again more a product of the trauma of seeing something horrible as a child, and Jack, not having what he wants, has to take to meeting other men in sordid locations and re-create a semblance of an affair with a man who resembles Ennis. In presenting these situations as they are and not trying to pursue change in its characters, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is the love story that transcends gender, space, time, and proves that love -- even when tragic -- is universal.Even so, will straight people see the message behind the story? I believe straight women (and a few enlightened straight men) will be the ones drawn to view the movie over a majority of conservative idiots who still hold the idea of two men locked in intimacy as being repugnant and are ripping their feeble brains out over the quasi ""gay agenda"" that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is trying to ""convert people to homoesexuality"". Sometimes it takes a movie like this which dares to take the risk and tell an unforgettable story rife in visual and emotional power -- true poetry in motion.All of the actors in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN are flawless, and all of them have roles that in another story might have been bland stereotypes of predictable natures. Jake Gyllenhaal is smoldering longing at the beginning but becomes a broken man who explodes in rage when he realizes that twenty years have gone down the drain. Heath Ledger goes one better: his painful speech, furtive eyes, and inward body language expresses an overwhelming set of emotions which state that he'd never be able to be happy with anyone, and his final scene holding Jack's shirt comes more as an apology to Jack than an added moment of schmaltz. Michelle Williams plays a typical housewife who is witnessing something she can't understand. Linda Cardellini, who comes quite late in the film, initially appears to be just a waitress, but is the person who gives Ennis an advice about love. Anne Hathaway's role as Jack Twist's wife is much more tricky: is she aware of his gayness or is she really all about business and having a perfect home? I get the feeling her character knows more than she expresses, and her turning progressively blonde is a manifestation of her choosing to look the other way and live a life of bitter complacency, best expressed in her telling speech about how ""men don't dance with their wives."" If she only knew.",Brokeback Mountain
98,pc95,Majestic backdrops - Ledger is excellent,7,15 April 2006,"So several people at my work refused to see the ""gay cowboy movie"". Oh well. This movie certainly is a bit more complex than that description. Although I think ""Saving Face"" is the best movie I've seen on people having to deal with homosexuality, this movie is a pretty good movie. Heath Ledger really shines as the stoic cowboy sort of caught up in something he's always ashamed of - his accent and mannerisms are tops; his character commands your interest and carries the movie....Jake Gyllenthal lends some decent support, although he doesn't hold his character nearly as defined (his accent wanders a lot). Actresses all provide convincing characters and support especially Michelle Williams as Ledger's poor confused wife. She and Ledger act out one of the better scenes in the movie over washing dishes The backdrops are spacious and majestic with vivid colors of nature, weather, wild-life, and plants. The movie takes you through years; one of the more difficult things for young actors to do is act aged/older, and that could've been handled a little better. Despite that, Brokeback Mountain is a tender drama with several poignant well done moments and always competently photographed. It deals with homosexuality as natural feelings for the characters, part of what people feel in an honest way.",Brokeback Mountain
99,Lady_Targaryen,The Polemic movie open to controversies,6,8 September 2006,"1963. Ennis del Mar and Jack Twist being to work on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming, on a shepherding job. Each one of them has a specific job: Ennis is stationed at the base camp, while Jack watches after the sheep higher on the mountain. Eventually, as long as the time passes, they switch roles and increase their contact, sharing more confidential things about their lives. In one night, however, after drinking a lot of whiskey, Ennis stays at the base camp instead of returning to the mountain. The weather is very cold and Jack invites Ennis to sleep in the same tent he is inside.Ennis is reluctant at first, but they finish having sex on that night, and that stays over the entire time they stay working on Brokeback Mountain.When the work ends, each one of them get separated lives, having children and marrying. They get separated during 4 years, until Ennis receives a postcard from Jack asking if he wants to meet when Jack passes through the area...I am afraid to even start to talk about this movie after all the polemic. I know that because I didn't love it or rated ''10'', many people will give me negative votes without even reading what I wrote. But whatever. The cinematography of the movie is beautiful and the actors are good( I loved to see Anne Hathaway in a very different role from the ''Princess Diaries''), but I was hoping that the movie would be much better then in fact is. The plot is not involving and the romance of the characters starts suddenly without any reason. Ennis doesn't have any consideration for his wife Alma and not even to his daughters, what makes him a terrible character to me. This movie doesn't deserve to be in the top 250 from the IMDb, sorry guys.",Brokeback Mountain
100,denis888,Waste of time,1,4 September 2006,"I know I will sound off the beaten path, but the film is a tedious bore. Do not waste your precious time on this candy sweet bubble gum. Come on, what did they wanna say? The story is unreal slow and extremely boring - two cowboys fall in love, make wild sex in a tent, then depart, get married, have unsuccessful family lives, give birth to kids, quarrel with wives, then meet again, then again make love, then one of them dies and another is sad. So, this is a Grammy Award film? Hello, are you sleeping? This is a monotonous melodramatic sugary sweetish gay-praising story, where there is no vivid play of either Heath Ledger or Jake Gyllenhaal - what do we see? Unending silent scenes, slow dialogs, and the bottom line? Gay style is great, go for it! What though the family is in ruins, and your life is vapid! I am deeply sorry but why don't we then have a film praising normal family with healthy heterosexual relations and happy kids? Or, hasn't it suddenly become so boring for us all? Do not waste your time on it. Or, rather, show it to kids to tell them that this lifestyle is ruinous.",Brokeback Mountain
101,bandw,The mystery of love and sex.,9,24 November 2005,"I read the short story ""Brokeback Mountain"" in The New Yorker when it was first published in 1997 and it made a deep impression on me. Enough for me to remember it well. So, it was of interest to see that a movie had been made based on the short story. One of the main reasons I liked the story is something that will be lost on almost everyone who sees the movie, and that is the element of surprise; by now most people will have heard that this movie is about ""gay cowboys."" However, in reading the story I had no idea what was coming - the story started with brief descriptions of the two guys and how they signed on for the sheep herding and so on. But then, without any previous hint, the initial sex scene occurs and you are taken in a quite unexpected direction. In anticipation of seeing the movie I reread the story and I can say that the movie is exceedingly faithful to the story. It is surprising that a thirty page story can be turned into a full length movie. Little is left out and only a few things added, like Jack's little contretemps with his father-in-law and the bear scene. In the story Ennis actually scares the bear instead of the other way around. But this is one of those rare cases where the movie meets or exceeds the scope and quality of the source.I ask myself why this tale is so absorbing and one reason I come up with is that it details a relationship that is unique in its realization. In many works of fiction dealing with gay themes a straight person can try to make sense out of the relationships by simply picturing one of the partners as male and the other as female, and that usually works. But this story does not allow for that - it is essential that the two protagonists be male. The story would not work any other way. I like movies that take me to new places, and this one did that.Others have remarked on the fine performance of Heath Ledger here and I concur. I had only seen him before in ""A Knight's Tale"" and he seemed all right in a role that was not too demanding. I was tending to write him off as just another pretty boy, but this performance changed that idea. The jury is still out for me on Jake Gyllenhaal, perhaps he is a bit upstaged here by Ledger, but I had just a bit more difficulty believing him in his role. Due to the casting the movie did give me a different perspective on the two characters. In reading the story I pictured Ennis as being the more delicate and openly emotional, but that was not my reaction to the guys in the movie. Ennis keeps the lid on his emotions pretty tightly here.The filming is well crafted. The story unfolds in a leisurely and straightforward manner - no fancy camera angles or clever segues. This works well in the telling of this deeply personal love story. The exquisite mountain scenery infuses the movie with a backdrop of beauty that augments the beauty of the relationship. The mountain settings lend credibility. A response to external beauty often evokes a response that, if not sexual, is certainly in that same area of the brain.Before seeing the movie I was curious as to how the initial sex scene would be handled, and it was done in a way to convey exactly what happens in the short story. As to how believable that scene is in terms of the initiation of a homosexual relationship I have spoken to some gay friends. Some feel that it is beyond what they could imagine and they were disturbed that it caters to the stereotype of what gay men always do. But perhaps a more insightful observation was that the two guys in the movie were picturing themselves as straight and had not had any homosexual encounters and, given that background, it was they who were in thrall to the stereotype and figured that that is what a homosexual experience should be. After that initial aggressive introduction to the overtly sexual part of the relationship the movie goes on to show many more tender moments. We come to understand that this movie is much more than being about gay cowboys, but rather it examines the power and mystery of love and sex. It also observes that being gay is still far from being easy - it takes its toll on those with that orientation as well as those who know them and love them.Nobody I have talked with heard the last line in the movie. What was it?",Brokeback Mountain
102,DJAkin,Great Cowboy Movie,10,13 December 2005,"This movie was great, reminded me of all the great scenery that is in New Mexico and Canada. There are some great scenes in which Jake and Heath act a little intense in terms of how much they like each other but still, great movie. That part where Randy Quaid (Cousin Eddie) sees the two of them messing around and rolling in the snow, was Oscar WORTHY for sure. I just hope that the ACEDEMY remembers this movie as the most daring movie of ALL TIME, yes ALL TIME. The actors were asked to do things that are unheard of in Hollywood. I saw the sneak preview this evening and the theater was PACKED WITH GAY PEOPLE. However, it was not a violent turnout, but rather a peaceful one.",Brokeback Mountain
103,sme_no_densetsu,Simply incredible,9,5 June 2008,"I'm not even going to bother discussing the prejudices that will prevent a large number of men from enjoying this film. That it will go unappreciated by many for such an inane reason is extremely unfortunate since in my opinion this is one of the best films of the decade thus far.For starters, the film is immaculately shot by Ang Lee with breathtaking cinematography throughout. Lee was justly rewarded with the Best Director Oscar while the cinematography also received a nomination. But you'll have to see it for yourself because words cannot describe how good this film looks.Another of the film's three Oscars went to the screenwriters. Instead of dumbing down the story the screenwriters opted for subtlety and produced a gem of understatement. The subject matter is treated with utmost maturity and the script is thankfully devoid of preachiness. This isn't a film about homosexuality, it's a film about the universal theme of forbidden love.The principle actors, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, are exceptional. At first I didn't take to Ledger's mumbly Ennis del Mar but by the end of the film he had made a believer out of me. He and Gyllenhaal are excellent together, exuding a complicated mix of warmth and ruggedness. In the supporting cast, Michelle Williams deserves special mention as del Mar's rejected wife. It is worth nothing that she nabbed an Oscar nomination for her work, as did Ledger and Gyllenhaal.There was one thing about the film that wasn't quite to my liking, though, and that's the score (which, incidentally, won the film its third Oscar). However, I will admit that it's unlike any score that I've heard before and my disapproval probably comes down to a question of taste.The biggest disappointment for this film on Oscar night was the loss to ""Crash"" in the category of Best Picture. I firmly believe that 2005 is one of those years that people are going to look back upon as a year that the Academy got it very wrong.",Brokeback Mountain

One can't help feeling sympathetic for the tortured soul he becomes, denying himself the happiness he can only find with Jack Twist, played by Jake Gyllenhall.The movie follows the story of the straight lives they create, with wives and children, but always the loss of each other underlines their existence apart, they live for the times they can have their annual fishing holiday together. This is not so much the story of gay love but of love that is denied its full expression, for whatever the reason, and how the subsequent lives led are stunted and incomplete.Beautifully filmed in Alberta and stellar performances from the cast. 8 out of 10.",Brokeback Mountain
105,Howlin Wolf,Things sure do change when you're up on 'Brokeback Mountain'...,8,23 February 2007,"I have to say what really impressed me the most was the scope of it all. I expected it to focus by and large on the immediate aftermath of Jack and Ennis' first coupling, but to my welcome surprise the whole film had a real sweeping, epic quality to it. When the bond that they shared survives such change in their circumstances it made the whole tale that much more evocative. It shows that regardless of your gender or your approach to relationships, love is like a tick that gets under your skin and won't ever stop affecting your mental processes throughout all of your time on earth (and don't I know that that sure is the truth... !!)Helping to emphasize these developments is some gorgeously languid direction by Lee - his camera seeming to caress the landscape he films - and also a wonderfully subtle turn from Ledger, especially. This shows Heath in a different light to any of his other films, and if he can transform himself this well, then maybe he isn't as much of a risk as I thought for Nolan's 'Joker', after all!I don't feel qualified to say whether it was the best picture of its year, but I certainly thought that it was braver and more emotionally genuine than ""Crash"". If you're anybody who's going to give ""Brokeback... "" a shot (and I suggest that everyone does) my advice is not to concentrate on its differences, but to instead take a clearer look at the smaller intimate details that can bring us all closer together if only we choose to let them.",Brokeback Mountain
106,Screen_Blitz,Ang Lee's emotionally complex story of homosexuality is powerfully crafted and deeply moving,10,29 April 2017,"Director Ang Lee's period piece is the home of a powerful love story, but definitely not the kind of love story Hollywood is richly experienced in. It is the love story between two cowboys who both happen to be men. Homosexuality has often stood as one of the most sensitive subject matter has Hollywood as ventured, especially when becoming the target of outcry from the conservative community. In fact, some may be familiar with numerous reports of communities fighting unsuccessfully to ban the film from theaters. Nonetheless, above the predictable controversy is a masterful crafted romantic tale that sees Ang Lee showcasing a trials and tribulations of a relationship that is often frowned upon by many, and the dangers that ensue from the fear of homophobic crowd. It is a tragic, it is complex, and at times, deeply frustrating. But ultimately, it is story that is difficult to forget. The film opens up in 1963 in Brokeback mountain of Wyoming. Two cowboys Jack Twist (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (played by Heath Ledger) are hired by Joe Aguirre (played by Randy Quaid) for a summer job at herding the sheep. The two start off as strangers before gradually becoming friends. But before the summer is over, the two develop a deep relationship with each other. When is summer is over, the two are forced to part ways where Ennis marries Alma (played by Michelle Williams) and has children, and Jack falls in love with cowgirl named Lureen (played by Anne Hathaway). Nonetheless, their love each other still lingers When the two men reunite however, they are forced to deal with the tragic hardships of their forbidden relationship. Classifying this 'Romeo and Juliet'-like romantic drama as a ""gay cowboy movie"" is somewhat accurate, but does feel slightly of a overstatement. The main pinnacle of this film is not just the relationship between these two men but the journey of these men questioning their sexuality when they both get wrapped up in the lives of family. The tragedy sees men face soon serves as the emotional crux of the plot. When the two go their separate ways, they both enter a relationship with a women they believe is their true love, but struggle trying to cope with the possibilities that still have feelings for each other. When the two men cross paths again, the two fall victim to tragedy as they struggle to hide their contraband relationship not only from their families but all of society. Ang Lee powerfully illustrates the pain and frustration of these men fighting to adjust to a society where homosexuals are constantly slipping into the cracks of maltreatment, an issue that still remained brutally relevant in America for the last several decades. Spanning across a course of twenty years, this showcases an incredibly powerful journey these men endure on keeping their relationship alive, and the results lead to an emotional roller-coaster that doesn't waste the capacity to make viewers shed tears in the final stretch.While Ang Lee's portrayal of this tragic is deeply riveting from his direction, to the elegantly crafted writing, this movie would not likely strike at the heart without the riveting performances of an inspiring cast. That is where Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger come in. Jake Gyllenhaal takes on arguably the most challenging role of his career, playing a cowboy who finds himself enigmatic by his sexuality when he crosses paths with Heath Ledger. He is incredibly diligent in his role and packs a strong emotional punch nearly every minute he is on screen. Standing his side is Heath Ledger who takes on an equally bold endeavor in the role as his lover, and is brilliantly convicted in his role. The chemistry between the two is shockingly subtle, if a bit uncomfortable for conservative moviegoers. The thick southern accents these two adopt also deserves a round of credit. Supporting the romantic duo is Michelle Williams who serves a character struck with tragedy when she learns about the shocking relationship between the two men. Anne Hathaway makes for a pleasant appearance, at least for the short amount of time she has on screen. Kate Mara gives a swell performance in her role as Heath Ledger's daughter, which may come off a slightly unusual considering the very short age gap between her and Ledger. Brokeback Mountain is an emotionally complex, yet powerful love story with astonishing performances and an inspiring craftsmanship by Ang Lee. This film is a rare cinematic gold that not only sheds light on the painful, yet honest truth of same-sex love, but defies against the overwhelming controversy driven by its contentious subject matter. While there is certainly no doubt that the material will send people of the conservative crowd running for the hills, it is an absorbing cinematic art that many others will come to appreciate.",Brokeback Mountain
107,KUAlum26,"A painful love story,period.",9,23 March 2006,"BY now,a lot has been written and said about this film. Having seen it somewhat recently and very attuned to the post-Oscar reaction since. I feel like weighing in just a little more.This story of two herdsmen(Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal,perfectly affecting) who discover first an attraction,then love while herding sheep in the mountains of Wyoming over one summer,then proceed to carry out a relationship that stretches nearly two decades,has garnered a lot more controversy than really seems necessary. This movie is,pure and simple,a love story,played out with great difficulty and filmed very beautifully. Some very affecting supporting performances by Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway(going different directions:Williams as the hurting and deeply personalized wife of Ledger's Ennis,Hathaway as a flinty,single-minded and stubborn wife of Gyllenhaal's JAck) flesh out this film. Add on colorfully smart cinematography by Rodrigo Prietro and music score by Gustavo Santoaallalla(Sp?) and you have a very memorable film. Director Ang Lee can make you almost completely forget he directed The Hulk from this work(Heck,you might even not make the connection to seemingly non-related works as The Ice Storm or Crouching Tiger,Hidden Dragon!),which to me would be a basically good thing.I've made my opinion as to the significance(or even lack of significance)that this film carries in regards to gays in film. Those who either want to laud this movie as groundbreaking(slight majority)to those who want to condemn it as promoting the gay agenda/lifestyle(a BIG misguided minority) can prattle on all they want. To me,this film is a scenic love story well made. Nothing more,nothing less.",Brokeback Mountain
108,Cosmoeticadotcom,Horrid,2,8 September 2008,"It is incumbent upon all good critics to be honest about possible biases, so here goes. When I first read E. Annie Proulx's short story collection Close Range, I knew Brokeback Mountain was, by far, the worst of the stories in her very erratic collection, and a really bad story, period. Not because it had gay characters, but because the whole book is a long string of Western stereotypes and caricatures. Reading the tale, it was quite obvious that Proulx has probably never met a gay person, much less a gay cowboy, in her entire life.However, after recently viewing the film that beat it out for the Oscar, Crash- a horrendous film, if there ever was one, I was prepared to concede that there was no possible way Brokeback Mountain, which I doubted could even be a passable film, could sink as low as Crash. After all, Crash crammed a dozen or so PC tales into its nightmare, whereas this film was only gonna force feed a viewer one PC tale. So buffered, I had made plans to begin my review of this film with something admitting the above, like, 'Yes, Brokeback Mountain is better than Crash, but chlamydia is better than AIDS, so what's the point?' But, I now again have to rewrite how I approach dissecting this film, for, as I set forth to watch Ang Lee's latest film, I was unprepared for just how interminably dull and poorly written and acted this film was.Yes, it's terminally PC, and no, it's not a love story, any more than the addle-minded and obnoxious young boob lovers in Titanic were in love. It's a tale about, let's face it, two horny guys who like branding each other in the wild. And yes, there is great scenery. This film trumps Crash cinematographically in every way. But, Crash sped through its many tales and characters so quickly that it was more like a music video, and, as a consequence, it was like a quick bug that, once you let out its last bad remnant, the fever lifted within minutes. Brokeback Mountain is like a festering herpes sore that will take a week or two to go away, but you just know it's gonna recur and damn your sleeping hours every now and then.The story of the film is so familiar that to reiterate it seems a waste of space. this is an incredibly dull, trite, tendentious, and tedious film, whose two leads are deceitful and thoroughly despicable losers whom even the film knows are not worth the time in developing, especially when the 'message' is there to sell it. As proof of the ignoble nature of the leads, Ennis even mumbles to Jack, 'Because of you, I'm nowhere,' blaming everyone but himself for his own shallow and insidious misery. This sort of bad writing, and dubious moralizing, makes Brokeback Mountain every bit as bad a film as its music video-like Oscar-winning rival, Crash.",Brokeback Mountain

Setting is in my opinion the best in film history and the natural beauties emphasize the strong feeling of separation and closing off. The movie is beautifully shot and these wonderful Canadian locations (the spectacular mountains are not in Wyoming..) make situations and characters more effective. Every feeling is rendered perfectly and the first sexual encounter, so explicit, is only a strong impact for exploring the anguish and fragility of this unfulfilled love. The lacerating ending leaves the audience with a strong sadness but with the sensation of having watched a great drama.",Brokeback Mountain
110,Philby-3,Cowboy gone with the wind,8,29 January 2006,"I wouldn't say I was blown away, but I was impressed. Basing the film on a short story by E Annie Proulx of ""Shipping News"" fame, the accomplished Ang Lee has fashioned a picturesque absorbing and poignant, if rather slow, love story. The lovers happen to be two men, and cowboy society is not terribly tolerant towards ""queers"", but ultimately it is a story about a love affair where neither party can make a total commitment. Both marry, have children, and yet go on their ""fishing trips"" several times a year for 20 years. The central mystery is why don't they break away. The period of the film, 1963 to 1983, was the coming out decades for homosexuals in the US. Admittedly Wyoming was a backwater but to find other gays all you had to do was to get in the pickup and drive on some excellent roads to San Francisco. But Ennis and Jack somehow can't take the step.Perhaps it is the tough backgrounds both characters have. Jack Twist's home was remarkably austere though his ""American Gothic"" parents, who we meet towards the end, seem loving in their stilted way. Ennis (an Irish name?) was orphaned as a child and brought up in a haphazard fashion by his brother and sister. It would be surprising if either had graduated from high school. Sheep herding is a minimum wage job (if you're lucky), though as it turns out later Jack does well as a tractor salesman.As Ennis, Heath Ledger, a local boy (all right, he's from Perth, WA) must be in for a chance at an Oscar, though they tend not to go to male actors early in their careers. E Annie herself is reported as saying that Heath went deeper into Ennis's character than she did. It was a pity about the mumbling (oh, not another Brando!) but we got the drift  this is one choked up character. He also handled the aging well  at the end it was hard not to accept he was 40. Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack had more lines to play with and a less inscrutable character, but he also gives a fascinating performance. As the wives Alma and Lureen, Michelle Williams (the real Mrs Ledger) and Anne Hathaway (her real name!) do what is required. It is interesting that their reactions to the realization their husbands are gay are rather different. Alma, very much in love, is devastated, but Lurleen, who probably married Jack to get away from her bullying father, is prepared to live with it.Ang Lee exploits the scenery shamelessly (as it happens Canadian rather than US Rockies, though it seems the sheep were American)  he is a very visual director. Man's presence in such places, he seems to be saying, is on sufferance  the first snow storm is evidence of that. Poor Ennis and Jack are not even on sufferance  they must even pretend their relationship is a secret when everybody knows about it.

111,mstomaso,Beautiful love story and period-piece,10,8 January 2006,"Best film of 2005Brokeback Mountain is the story of two western young men who fall in love, what they are allowed to do about it by the time and place in which they reside, and what they do end up doing about it. It is also a story of developing the courage to be the person you want to be, regardless of the costs. The film walks the line between touching and gut-wrenching in its emotional impact, and should probably only be seen in an emotionally strong frame of mind.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal give the best performances I have seen either of them give, playing two guys whose love for each other defies society, and at least early on, their own self-concepts as well. The two men choose to lead double-lives rather than giving up what they have found together. Yet their secrets threaten everything.The film is less dialog-based than the usual contemporary character study. Some of the most memorable scenes have very little chat. This method allows the viewer to allow his or her imagination to enter the story, giving a sense of participation and collaborative plot development rarely achieved in today's cinema.Ang Lee has put together a great film which could have wide appeal. It is disturbing to me that this film had such a limited early release in the United States. Have we really become so socially retrograde that the homo-phobia of a loud-mouthed minority of reactionary fanatics is easier for us to take than an unconventional love story? I hope not.",Brokeback Mountain
112,brchthethird,A touching and tragic love story,8,24 March 2015,"For the longest time I've avoided watching this film because of its status as ""that gay cowboy movie."" At some point I probably had some aversion to the subject matter, but now having put that aside I must say that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a touching, almost heartbreaking portrait of friendship and love. The cast is lead by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal as Ennis Delmar and Jack Twist, respectively. One summer, in 1963, they both work as ranch hands on Brokeback Mountain and in their isolation they develop a romantic relationship which continues for the next 20 years. Of course, this is at a point in history when homosexuality wasn't tolerated, by and large, so the two of them have to keep their relationship a secret. Both of them even get married and have children, but still manage to ""go fishing"" a few times a year. Still, Ennis and Jack are quite different people. Jack is more open about his desire to settle down, while Ennis is more conflicted (and, for the time, pragmatic). While a lot of films that deal with homosexuality and gay themes often focus on the hardships and self-loathing, this one doesn't. And as a period piece, a love story between two ""out and proud"" men wasn't really an option to begin with. I also liked how the material wasn't sensationalized by being too explicit. There's a couple of gay sex scenes, but the film mostly focuses on the two characters and their developing relationship. I should also mention the supporting cast, a few of whom I was surprised to see (but not in a bad way). There was Randy Quaid as J. Aguirre, the manager of the ranch that Ennis and Jack work for that summer in 1963. He only had a few scenes, but he did a really good job with his limited screen time. There was also Anne Hathaway as Laureen, the woman who Jack ends up marrying, Michelle Williams as Ennis' wife, Anna Faris, and Kate Mara as the grown-up version of Ennis' eldest daughter. Since the film is mainly about Ennis and Jack, the supporting cast doesn't get as much to do, but it was so well-written and acted that it was OK. Also worthy of mention is the beautiful cinematography and gentle score which complement the story quite nicely. The only fault I can find is that the film goes on for a little too long, like they weren't sure how to wrap it up. Still, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a warm, poignant love story that should speak to you no matter what your sexual orientation is. Just put aside your preconceived notions and give it a try if you haven't already.",Brokeback Mountain
113,emasterslake,Not Oscar Worthy in my judgment.,5,3 March 2007,"I remember when this first came out back in 2005. I didn't know what it was about, I just kept hearing it was gay every time someone at my high school would bring it up. I finally saw it last February.It takes place in the 60s-70s. About 2 young cowboys given a job to guide thousands of sheep through the wilderness, through Brokeback Mountain, and to the ranch that's located there. As both Dennis and Jack bound with one another. They soon begin to have an unpredictable relationship. And liked each other in a way. But after their job was over they went back to their lives. They both went their separate ways and married straight women. But have met again time after time. But hardly anyone knows what they are up to. And soon things become complicated about why couldn't they get together and start a life at Brokeback. As well as their relations with their wives are becoming thinner and thinner.Please know that I'm straight, & didn't watch this movie because of it's theme. I just wanted to know what the whole big fuss was about it. And despite it having some great visuals in the backgrounds and Anna Hatheway playing as a secondary character. I give it credit on the camera job. But I don't think it's really worthy of being awarded for any category in cinema. The story is what gives me negative thoughts about it. I have nothing against homosexuals. It's just not a movie to see again and again.Brokeback Mountain is recommended to those who don't mind gay people. Even though the word gay wasn't used at all through out the movie. But those who are against non-straight people will hate it a lot.",Brokeback Mountain
114,sharky_55,And now all we got is Brokeback Mountain.,9,7 September 2016,"The two first set eyes on each other silently. It is six minutes, after their initially job briefing, before they finally exchange a few clipped pleasantries and go on their way. The dialogue in Brokeback Mountain is only ever used as a last resort, when gesturing and actions can take you no further. It is little more than half-grunts, words masked by their drawls and layers of masculinity that prevent them from saying how they feel. Lee is more than competent visually, so he knows other ways of expressing this. The first sex scene is in almost complete darkness as they fumble around and rip at each other's clothes - he expects the viewer to orientate via the sounds. And what are they? Not tender words, or even moans, but guttural, deep-bodied grunts. It is less a less scene and more a wrestling match, in the way they grapple and push and shove. And of course there is that tremendous shallow focus shot of a nude Ennis in the background and Jack in the foreground. It hovers for longer than necessary, holding and holding until we are all but pleading for him to turn and look. There is repression that trembles in the frame itself, and his resolve is steadfast, at least for the moment. There is a great secondary cast surrounding them that also push and pull. Lee knows their importance. In a lesser film the forbidden love would be framed as some fervid romantic fantasy. The wives would be bitchy and the kids a nightmare, and they would yearn so much more for their escape into paradise. But this understands that Alma is a character too, and that she suffers in her own way. She is as similarly unequipped as her husband to deal with such things, and so briefly she is also in that state of continuous pain. Lee shows the same situation with Lureen, and through the edit allows for clever contrast. The last thing Jack does before leaving for his 'fishing trip' is to kiss her on the lips, and Alma (and the audience) expects the same from her husband. But Ennis is simply reaching for his bag, and the moment is like a gut-punch for both us and Williams. Ah, but she has learned the same ways of internalisation, and silently voices her pain. The same vicious comparison is seen during Thanksgiving - as one man is being displaced as the man of the house, the other makes his stand. Their respective tone and body language (Ledger is all but slumped and defeated) speak volumes of how they approach the sensitive issue of the visibility of their sexuality. The film covers a period of twenty years, and Lee never feels the need for any hefty title cards, but illustrates the passing of time in smaller details. Ennis flips Alma over to mimic Jack, and the groaning bed-springs give way to the match cut to the breaking rodeo gate miles away. The delicate twangs of the guitar submit to trip after trip, with inhibitions slowly papering themselves over and then cracking passionately, and sometimes, violently. A shabby cloth propped up by sticks eventually becomes something more of a shelter, but meanwhile Ennis' home and life slowly closes in on him. Who was it that Alma Junior was dating again? Brokeback Mountain is all about how Ennis is uncomfortable in his own skin because of a sight thrust into his eyes by his father at a young age, and how this tears him up inside. But in the process it is also about destroying the discomfort of the screen. They start as prototypical western males, thumbs tucked into belt loops, their skin coarse, their mouths sewn shut. The awareness not only exists on our level (both Gyllenhall and Ledger were young but established) but within their world, and each muscle of their body is fighting that pre-programmed urge that constantly reinforces itself through the culture and the people. This culminates in the most powerful scene of the film, when Ennis returns to Jack's parents and offers to scatter his ashes atop Brokeback Mountain. Every person in the room knows what he is here for, and what his former relationship to Jack was. John Twist speaks carefully. He twists the knife, goading Ennis through how cruelly he refers to his deceased son, and how he cannot show any emotion or mourn like they are allowed to. And Ledger cannot show that it hurts him, although we can see the pain etched in his face. Lee has made gay films in the past, but this most reminds me of Wong Kar- Wai's Happy Together, about another gay couple that were trapped in the ever-vicious cycle of love and hate. But that was more intimate, lusher in both setting and tone. Ennis Del Mar does not have the same luxury.",Brokeback Mountain
115,gftbiloxi,Quietly Devastating,10,4 February 2006,"BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN has been described as ""a gay love story."" It is true that the story concerns an on-going relationship between two men, but this is merely the pebble director Ang Lee throws into the pond; the film itself is about the ripples the stone makes, and by examining them in meticulous fashion BROKEBACK creates a portrait of the way human beings are distorted by both external and self-imposed repression. It is a powerful film, an artful film. It is also one of the most painful films I have seen, the sort of film from which you emerge with a stunned sensation, and a film that lingers in your mind for a very long time afterward.In terms of plot the movie begins simply enough. Two ranch hands, Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal), are hired to tend sheep on Brokeback Mountain in the summer of 1963. Ennis is a very self-contained man. Jack is more outgoing and is presented, in a relatively subtle way, as a man who is open to sexual possibilities. As the summer progresses they become friends, and as Ennis opens up emotionally the two suddenly begin a sexual relationship. Although they are careful to tell each other that they are not gay, and although the words ""I love you"" never cross their lips, the relationship develops into a romantic one. But all summers must end. The two men, struggling with emotions they are ""not supposed to have"" for each other, leave the mountain and each other. Both men marry; both have children; both go on with their lives.But the stone makes ripples in the pond. Ennis, more so than Jack, is utterly unable to accept the idea that he is homosexual--and yet when Jack seeks him out several years later it is Ennis who leaps at Jack both sexually and emotionally, and what began as a seemingly transient affair rapidly develops into an overpowering relationship that they must conceal from wives, children, and society--and the consequences of concealment are devastating for all concerned. This is particularly true of Ennis, who has few internal resources, who is more afraid of social retribution, and who can neither let go of Jack nor bring himself to agree that they can live discreetly together. The result is a series of internal tragedies, failures, losses, and frustrations, all of which create a deep and abiding pain from which there is no escape.In terms of art, the film is beautifully crafted. Director Ang Lee approaches his material with a sparse grace and an eye for the telling detail, presenting the characters in such a manner as to allow you see them in the fullest possible way. He is greatly assisted in this by the remarkably powerful script by Larry McMurty and Diana Ossana, which translates Annie Proulx's memorable short story to the screen in both brilliant recreation and illumination, and by Rodrigo Prieto's simple yet compelling cinematography. The cast is fine beyond all possible expectation, never sounding a false note, and we believe them from start to finish. Nothing is either overplayed or underplayed; there is no artificially heightened drama; no manufactured element any kind. Indeed, with the single exception of an occasional make-up effect, it is virtually impossible to fault the film on any level. Is it a great masterpiece? I think it may well be. Time will tell.The film has been controversial on several fronts, but most particularly for the homosexual relationship that forms the spine of the plot. Some critics have seen this as evidence of ""Hollywood's leftist agenda;"" others have stated that the film is the best possible argument for same sex marriage. To adopt these attitudes, however, is to impose ideas on BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN that do not actually exist in the film. It is a rare example of a film that does not tell you what to think; it simply presents a story of what things were like, and in some respects are still like, for gay men and their families in America. It leaves you to make your own judgment about right, wrong, and where sympathy should reside.In closing, I will make an cautionary observation: while I strongly recommend the film, I must note that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN will likely take a toll on many gay viewers akin to the toll taken by PLATOON on Vietnam vets. I think this will be particularly true of gay men from largely rural and small town backgrounds and who are presently in their forties or older. It is profoundly painful to see elements of your life undergo this sort of extremely public autopsy, and had I realized the accuracy of the film I might well have elected to wait for a release to the home market. Having said this, I also note that in a visual sense BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN really requires the breadth of a movie screen, and I do recommend that it be seen in that format if at all possible.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Brokeback Mountain
116,Stampsfightclub,excellent portrayal of love,9,23 May 2008,"Heath Ledger (Monster's Ball) stars as Ennis Del Mar, a man sent to work on Brokeback Mountain alongside Jake Gyllenhaal's (Donnie Darko) character Jack Twist. As work takes its toll, the two fall in love and encounter many challenges as time moves on.Based on Annie Proulx's novel, this Oscar winning romantic drama brings a sensitive ideology to viewers in a heart warming tale about two cowboys.The slow moving plot took a while to get into at the beginning but as we see more of the character's personalities does the film start to become intriguing viewing. The plot is excellent in focusing strongly upon the character's personalities and the emotions each go through as they slowly start to bond. His ideology will keep you hooked as it follows many relationship conventions but is told in such a way that it is sad and also portrays realism, which many romantic films do, but in a soppy way. This drama differs by being less comical and more serious in its nature and you can really feel for the two characters.This film, I believe, wouldn't have been as great if Ledger and Gyllenhaal not stared in it, they were simply astonishing in their roles as the two cowboys. Both receiving Oscar nominations, the two are brilliant in conforming to their characters, and perfect the nature of their sexuality even more so. Both with their own personal backgrounds we can get an understanding of what they are like and where they have been as the film progresses.Ang Lee's (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) direction is excellent. I personally love films which have scenes of around 5 seconds long, just beautiful in portraying the character in everyday life, perfect realism which needs to be encoded more into modern day films. Lee captures the intensity of the characters brilliantly with close shots encoded to portray their emotions and one of the scenes towards the end is really sentimental and couldn't have been directed much better.Brokeback Mountain is a wonderful setting, quite and peaceful in which this story about two people who fall in love could not have been better placed.",Brokeback Mountain
117,fwomp,Breaking 1963 Societal Taboos On Brokeback Mountain,7,1 January 2006,"Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) are two down-on-their-luck cowpokes looking for a summer job as they silently meet outside a dusty ranch trailer in 1963 Wyoming. Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid), ranch boss, gives them the duty of moving a herd of sheep up to a spot called Brokeback Mountain where they'll wile away the hours protecting the flock from predators and allowing them to graze. Their lives are pretty boring and tough, each having to cook, keep an eye on the sheep, and suffer their daily routines. Until one night ...Ennis comes down from the mountain and is too drunk to go back up, so falls asleep outside Jack's tent. Ennis' shivering awakens Jack and he tells Ennis to get inside the tent before he freezes. It is here that something extraordinary and frightening happens: they have sex. It isn't the soft, touchy-feelie kind either. It's rough and earnest, as though they had hidden something deep down inside each of them that finally was allowed out for some air. But their activities don't go unnoticed ...Their boss, Joe Aguirre, catches sight of the two of them ""wrestling"" and decides to pull them off the mountain. Their summer is cut short and as they part ways, Ennis and Jack are awkward and hesitant. Jack drives away and Ennis walks down the street, watching Jack's truck vanish down the road. And as this happens, Ennis suddenly become overwhelmed and crumples to the ground, acting as if a part of him has been ripped out.Jack and Ennis won't meet up for another four years, during which time they both become married, have children, and develop a semblance of societal normalcy. But when they do finally meet up, they run into each others arms and are immediately back on Brokeback Mountain.But can their relationship survive in a time when ""alternate lifestyles"" were taboo? Can Ennis give as much as Jack wants (Jack continually asks Ennis to move with him to a quiet cabin spot and help with a herd of their own, but Ennis can't break away from what his family and society expects of him)?Ang Lee (HULK, 2003) delivers his best film to date. The panoramic shots of the mountains were awe-inspiring, and the period vehicles, saddles, and other props were excellent.Much has been made of Heath Ledger's performance, and I must say that I was highly impressed with his excellent portrayal of a quiet cowboy in conflict with himself and the world around him.Jake Gyllenhaal does a fine job, too, as the more earnest love interest, wanting more and more each time they meet up.The only issues I had with the film were its pacing and the ""love"" the two feel for each other that some other reviewers have so adamantly pointed out. The pacing was very slow, like the lives of these two men, so if you're expecting a bang-bang (no pun intended) action, don't get your hopes up. But if you don't mind a very leisurely pace (I'd say it's about on par with the film SIDEWAYS, so if you didn't like that film's pace, stay away from this one), you'll probably love it to pieces.The ""love"" should've been ratcheted up a notch. The scenes took on a sense of paramours meeting rather than two people truly in love.But the upside of the movie can't be denied. It touches on relationships in a way that most films can't get close to, and does so in a dramatic and thought-provoking way. And ogling at the stunning mountain backdrops added that extra bit of flavor, too.",Brokeback Mountain

It's gorgeously photographed in gorgeous country (Alberta, not Wyoming)although they overdid the polarizing filters on the blue skies. It examines homosexuality in a mature and responsible manner. Indeed, I was more offended by the constant smoking than I was by the frequent gay grappling scenes. The story and the acting of it were excellent.

119,TOMASBBloodhound,And nobody was even protesting!,8,15 January 2006,"Who would've thunk that a film dealing with this type of subject matter could be shown in this town at the same multiplex where the standard family-oriented junk was playing. I never expected this film to be shown around here, but the extraordinary success it has had in other markets has apparently paved the way. Surprisingly enough, nobody was making a scene outside. Not even the guy with the 9ft tall cross who protests EVERY movie. He was decidedly absent on Friday night. Is this a sign that we've come a long way in these parts since the whole Teena Brandon thing? Maybe.That said, let's take a look at the actual film. Brokeback Mountain is a very good film. It falls a little short of greatness, but that was expected. It's hard for any film to live up to so much hype, I suppose. The film is very long considering the length of the story it is based on. Ang Lee knows how to show us the physical environment these people live in, but he has a little trouble giving us the insight needed to truly know the characters. We know that Jack loves Ennis. We aren't really sure how Ennis feels about anyone. Perhaps he does not know, himself. Only in the film's final frame do we see the depth of his emotions and begin to understand his degree of regret.There is not much in the way of graphic sex. Much is implied, but little is shown. There is some nudity, but it's mostly fleeting. Jack and Ennis share some of the most passionate kisses ever put on film. We see the destructive effect of infidelity, and the consequences of marriages that never should have happened. We are shown the lonely world that comes from a person longing for someone they can't have, or refusing to acknowledge their true identity.The soundtrack is minimal, but it will stick with you for a while. The scenery is exceptional, but considering where this was filmed, it had to be. The acting is strong across the board, and the subject matter will no doubt lead to multiple Academy Awards.The film was profitable almost from the get-go, and it continues to rake in the cash wherever it's shown. The makers of this film, and especially its stars need to be commended for tackling such illicit subject matter in a way which could introduce it to the masses.The average film-goer who may only be used to Hollywood blockbusters and light-weight fluff will not enjoy Brokeback Mountain. They'd be better off sticking with King Kong or something of that nature. If you like The Last Picture Show, or other introspective human dramas, and you have somewhat of an attention span, then Brokeback might just ""get you good"". And sorry all you South Park fanatics. There wasn't any pudding in the film! 8 of 10 stars.The Hound.",Brokeback Mountain

It is also the tale of one man's problem with his own emotions and the conflicts he has when he tries to live a double life.""Brokeback Mountain"" tells the story of the relationship between two cowboys who met each other while working in Brokeback mountain on the summer of 1963. We follow their relationship first as friends, then as lovers who must keep their love secret. Through the eyes of Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger), we discover the conflicts that his secret love for Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) creates in his life; and how he must face his inner fears to avoid damaging everyone he meets.Even when the topic at hand still is seen as taboo in this days, Ang Lee's adaptation of Annie Proulx's short-story is not the definitive ""gay"" movie; people of every sexual orientation can relate to the characters and the situations they go through. This is one of the movie's biggest strengths, the fact that it portrays very human and realistic characters. Neither Ennis nor Jack are bi-dimensional cartoons; each is a complex world on its own and the central point of the story is when those two worlds collide.Heath Ledger's performance is vital for this movie to succeed, as he is our eyes in this venture. We witness how he chooses the easy way out and marries a local girl instead of staying with his true love Jack, creating with this decision a problem that will grow as big as their love, and that they'll have to face eventually. The movie is not only about Ennis and Jack, is about Ennis personal growth and how to achieve the emotional maturity he must endure difficult tests in his life.Gyllenhaal is also great as Jack Twist, but definitely the movie belongs to Ledger. Same can be said of Michelle Williams, as Ennis's heartbroken wife Alma, who can't understand what is going wrong with their marriage. Her performance is powerful, and at times she manages to overshadow Ledger with her perfect portray of the emotions of this devastated woman.Aesthetically, the movie is wonderful. Ang Lee does for Wyoming's mountains what he did for China's exotic landscapes in his previous masterpiece ""Wo Hun Cang Long""; he manage to showcase nature in a way that appears new, pure and irremediably beautiful. Together with Gustavo Santaolalla subtle but effective score, create a perfect image that reflects both the beautiful and the lonely sides of Ennis' life.The saddest thing of this movie, is that most people will get immersed in the homosexual-controversy, and will lost the beautiful message of the movie. It is not about homosexuals or heterosexuals, it is about love between two human beings. It is a shame that this modern classic of romance, will be remembered for it's controversy rather than for its artistic value. 8/10",Brokeback Mountain

It's the supreme restraint and subtlety with which the story is told that resonates with us long after we leave the theatre: rather than having everything spelled out for us six ways from Sunday, we're given the opportunity to fill in the rest ourselves, privately, and in this way, Jack and Ennis' story becomes absorbed by us on an organic level, making it a personal story - this is the 'haunting' effect that so many people have been writing about in their commentaries, and other filmmakers should be learning from this masterfully realized, majestically heartfelt cinematic experience.",Brokeback Mountain

BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is the latter of those special films...a movie that quietly wraps its sad and gentle hands around your heart, squeezes firmly and refuses to let go, even weeks after you've seen it...the FIRST time.The team of Ang Lee, Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, Rodrigo Prieto, Gustavo Santoalalla, Marit Allen and every single person involved with breathing life into E. Annie Proulx's heartbreaking tale have outdone themselves...and undone audiences across the land who walked in expecting a gay cowboy story, only to come out transformed by a timeless tale of love found, love lost, and love still sustained in the face of impossible antagonism, prejudice and ultimately, violence.There is no quibbling over who gave the best performance doing what. Both Heath and Jake have forever etched their names into the firmament of classic film actors with their uncompromising performances. Ditto the beautiful work by Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway, Linda Cardellini and Roberta Maxwell. Ang Lee has made sure that this is a movie where no part is too small or insignificant. Even Randy Quaid's brief appearance makes a considerable and ominous impression.This is not a movie for very young kids, and even not one for older kids to view without their parents or older family members. But for anyone else who has a heart and has had it broken, gay, straight or otherwise inclined; if you are a human being with a soul, there is no way you will not be moved.And to answer an oft-asked question: yes, I do believe that the 2005 Oscar for Best Actor will go to Heath Ledger. See him in this movie and then tell me I'm wrong. More importantly, see this movie, PERIOD.I do not award films with a rating of '10' lightly...I'm happy to say that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN has earned the right to that score, and then some.",Brokeback Mountain
126,Vivekmaru45,I Saw This Film Out Of Respect For The Late Heath Ledger.,10,4 January 2013,"I am fortunate that I did see this superbly directed film by Ang Lee who directed Hulk(2003).It is an adaptation of a short story written by a journalist Edna Annie Proulx. Imagine that, a woman writing a gay(male) story. But the story itself is unbelievably believable. That two guys find a lot of things in common with themselves, and then take the plunge, far away from the norms of society.The only reason I see films like this one and also Philadelphia directed by Jonathan Demme is that I once saw a film that moved me deeply. I tried to search for it on the internet, but without the name of the film I was at a dead end. I don't even remember the name of the actor in the film. Finally after much research...I think I got the name of the film. It's called The Price Of Love (1995). Could some kind soul create a torrent of this film and upload it for all to see?The story was of a teenager who leaves the country for the city. There he finds no work. Starving, he makes contact with a group of teens who are using prostitution to earn money. One of the guys takes him under his wings and teaches him the ropes. We find with horror how this poor guy is taken advantage of. Well in the end he goes to a group(social services) that gives him a way out of this miserable existence. Back to this film Brokeback Mountain: In 1963, Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) are hired by Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) to herd his sheep through the summer in Wyoming. After a night of heavy drinking, Jack makes a sexual pass at Ennis, who is initially apprehensive but eventually falls to Jack's advances. Though he informs Jack that it was a one-time incident, they develop a sexual and emotional relationship. Shortly after learning their summer together is being cut short, they briefly fight, and each is bloodied.After Jack and Ennis part ways, Ennis marries his longtime fiancée Alma Beers (Michelle Williams) and fathers two children. Jack returns the next summer, but Aguirre, who witnessed Jack and Ennis on the mountain, does not re-hire him. Jack meets, marries, and starts a family with rodeo rider Lureen Newsome (Anne Hathaway). After four years, Jack visits Ennis. Upon meeting the two kiss passionately, which Alma accidentally witnesses. Jack broaches the subject of creating a life together on a small ranch, but Ennis, haunted by a childhood memory of the torture and murder of a man suspected of homosexual behavior, refuses. He is also unwilling to abandon his family. Ennis and Jack continue to meet for infrequent fishing trips.The marriages of both men deteriorate. Alma and Ennis eventually divorce. Ennis sees his family regularly until Alma finally confronts him about her knowledge of the true nature of his relationship with Jack by making homophobic remarks which incites a violent argument and causes Ennis to abandon his connections with Alma. Lureen abandons her rodeo days and becomes a businesswoman with her father and expects Jack to work in sales. Hearing about Ennis's divorce, Jack drives to Wyoming hoping they can live together, but Ennis refuses to move away from his children. Jack finds solace with male prostitutes in Mexico. Ennis meets and has a brief romantic relationship with a waitress, Cassie Cartwright (Linda Cardellini). Jack and Lureen meet and befriend another couple, Randall and Lashawn Malone, and it is implied that Jack and Randall begin an affair behind their wives' backs.Find out what happens next...Verdict: Superb photography. The locale is stunning. Ledger is a better actor than Jake Gyllenhaal any day of the week. The only problem I have with Ledger is that he has an ordinary face. Take for example Mel Gibson. Now that guy has a face. Story pacing is a smooth and comfortable ride. The climax of the film leaves you with a jolt. You know how lonely Ennis Del Mar really is and he has been denying himself all along. His life is a lie and we really feel sympathy for him. I think this could be Ang Lee's greatest contribution.Similar themed film: Longtime Companion.",Brokeback Mountain
127,Danusha_Goska,Elegant; Beautiful; Important; Did Not Move Me,7,8 January 2006,"I expected a lot from ""Brokeback Mountain."" Pre-release buzz has been overwhelming, and overwhelmingly positive. Ang Lee is a favorite.""Brokeback Mountain"" is a beautiful, elegant, important movie. The performances are first rate. Randy Quaid, Roberta Maxwell, and Grahm Beckel are particularly brilliant in small roles. ""Brokeback Mountain,"" as a whole, just didn't move me.I know that professional and amateur reviewers have emphasized how moving and ""haunting"" this film is. I know there are often audible sobs in theaters.I thought it was a beautiful, intelligent, very, very classy movie.But it didn't move me. I've seen a lot of stupider, less beautiful, less classy movies that reduced me to tears.My specific problem was: why are these two people so much in love? We've all had attractions like that. You're in your twenties, you're in the middle of nowhere, the person next to you becomes the be all and end all of existence ... but, still to be hankering after that person twenty years later, with no one else taking their place? That hasn't happened to me, or, afaik, to anyone I know.The one moment of high emotion for me in the movie was when Jack's mom shows a kindness to Ennis that involves a piece of clothing ...those who've seen the movie know what i'm talking about.But the love between Ennis and Jack is the fulcrum of the movie. If that doesn't convince and compel the viewer, you're left looking at two hours plus of sheep, mountains, and horses.It's not Gyllenhaal's or Ledger's fault. They are both beyond reproach. I just wish director Ang Lee or scriptwriter Larry McMurtry had created some scenes that would communicate more clearly, and more devastatingly, the depth and complexity of this human bond.I can think of numerous movies that depicted bonds between males that convinced me more thoroughly than ""Brokeback Mountain"" did that the two males on screen, if separated, would be deeply wounded by that separation.Some, like ""Bent,"" depicted gay male couples; many, from the Robert Redford-Paul Newman and Walter Mathau-Jack Lemon movies, to Ben Affleck and Matt Damon in ""Good Will Hunting"" and Jay and Silent Bob in their eponymous film -- depict straight male couples.I experienced intellectual admiration for the movie. Its well-conveyed central irony is that the cinematic wide-open spaces of the American West, iconic as the ultimate site of human freedom, becomes little more than an emotional cage for the main characters.",Brokeback Mountain
128,rainking_es,Too much controversy = disappointment...,7,11 July 2006,"Once upon a time there were two brawny cowboys that loved each other so much, and they spent the nights giving free hand to his love inside their tent there at the Wyoming mountains. They wished they could stay just like that for ever and ever, but it's not possible. In the deep America of the 60s (and at present time) it was quite a taboo to be a gay, so they'd better marry and have some children... the way is meant to be. Maybe they'll meet each other once a year and they'd be able to release they're true instincts... but that'll be all.Anytime a movie creates a big controversy you end up discovering that it wasn't that important at all. Ang Lee perfectly portraits those wonderful mountains, those streams, th sunsets... maybe he recreates himself too much (he just CAN'T make a movie of less than 2 hours). So, what's best about ""Brokeback Mountain""? Well, the photography, of course; the extraordinary beauty of those enclaves... and the work of Heath Ledger. I always thought he was a second rate-expressionless actor, but he makes a virtue out of that expressionless in this movie. He really looks like a redneck (even though he's born in Australia).*My rate: 7/10",Brokeback Mountain
129,TheNorthernMonkee,"powerful, moving, but personal unease still remains",8,25 September 2005,"SPOILERS First and foremost, ""Brokeback Mountain"" will probably forever be labelled as 'that film about the gay cowboys', but that's only half the story. Beautifully shot by Ang Lee and with multiple Oscar nominations over the horizon, the film is a powerful and brutal film about a secret love which is neither socially or personally acceptable. It is a joy to watch, but at the same time, as a heterosexual male, it still sits uncomfortably on the mind.When Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) meet on a sheep herding job, both lives will be forever changed. After a brutal opening to their relationship and a slow developing love, they go their separate ways. Whatever they do in their lives though, the love is never far away.This is the finest film that Heath Ledger has ever done by a considerable distance. Absolutely superb as Ennis, Ledger is a revelation. He genuinely gives the impression of loving Gyllenhaal. The former ""Donnie Darko"" star is also out of this world, and just like Ledger, he gives a portrayal which is so natural, that it sits uncomfortably on the surface and which many find awkward to watch.This is perhaps the ultimate tribute you can give to ""Brokeback Mountain"". Whilst films are constantly using homosexuality as an issue nowadays, few have such a shock inducing effect on the heterosexual male. You feel uncomfortable watching particular scenes in this movie, and the simple fact is that you feel that way because the characters affection feels real. It's just like Harry and Sally, or Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. The on screen chemistry is there and you generally accept that they are a couple. In ""Brokeback Mountain"" Ledger and Gyllenhaal are so perfectly in tune with each other, you believe that they genuinely feel that way. Their performances are simply out of this world and if they don't even get a nomination, then you know that the Academy Awards are flawed.As well as about the love of two men, the beauty of ""Brokeback Mountain"" is the way it shows the attitudes of loved ones to the realisation. Michelle Williams as Ledger's wife is on form as she follows the love, and likewise Anne Hathaway is brilliant as you question how much she genuinely knows about the relationship.Hathaway has come a long way since ""The Princess Diaries"" and this is easily the finest performance she's done so far. It's a shame though that she does partly ruin it by being a part of the films attempts to drag in the heterosexual male. Hathaway's part is not a small role, but when, after being on screen for ten minutes, she strips off her top, you know that she's been used to drag in certain members of the audience. Her part in the film is arguably more crucial than Williams, but the exposure of breasts by both women is completely unnecessary and serves little more than to encourage particular types to watch the film. It's a shame the film has to do this, but that's life.Director Ang Lee is, by any definition, a legend for having the courage to make this film. A difficult subject since most heterosexual men still find the whole topic of same sex relationships (male anyway) to be awkward, Lee has take a gamble and it has paid off. Creating a beautiful and moving story, Lee has managed to get stellar performances by his young cast. Ledger in particular comes in for praise with a natural performance which genuinely does cause an awkward feeling for most straight men. We can enjoy the film for it's merits and it's story (even if the ending is ever so slightly too drawn out), but watching Ledger fall for Gyllenhaal gives an uneasy feel which is difficult to shake off. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is an awkward but beautiful masterpiece.",Brokeback Mountain
130,russem31,Beautiful,9,23 January 2006,"Brokeback Mountain is a very well done film, directed by master director Ang Lee (of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon fame). After the dismal Hulk, he returns in top form for this film. What really makes this film work is the proper casting of the main characters played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, whose chemistry really works and is believable. The cinematography also is top notch, with the mountain vistas looking either beautiful and serene or at other times dark and dismal, which symbolically represents how the main characters feel about each other at any one time. A must see for sure - a definite 9 out of 10.",Brokeback Mountain
131,Atreyu_II,All the hype is virtually ridiculous,3,31 December 2011,"Before I started to write my own review, I took one good look at the reviews around here. I didn't pay much attention to the positives because my priority were the negatives. And I agree with a lot of things said by the people who wrote negatives.There is frankly nothing memorable in this film. Its one saving grace is some of the beautiful scenario of Brokeback Mountain but there is so little of it. I mean, so little of the best of the scenario.It's a painfully slow and long (2+ hours) movie, as much as it is forgettable and boring to death, so boring that I could yawn like a lion. It isn't even the slightest bit entertaining. The acting of Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal and all other actors is clearly overrated. To be frank, both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall act quite badly, but Jake acts particularly badly. Heath could act a little better but still he wasn't a great actor. He had a typically cowboy voice but that wasn't enough.Also, there isn't any real feelings, emotion, sympathy and chemistry between the lead actors. They simply weren't believable together. All they did was this: one moment they were kissing and making love and suddenly they were brutish to each other and constantly yelling. Their story was so forced and phony, just like the rest of the movie.Other negative aspects were the lack of character development, the weak plot, the bad direction and finally the thing that bothers me most: the implied animal cruelty. Some animals here are shown in highly questionable condition. As an animal lover, that disturbs me and horrifies me.I'm glad that at least I didn't waste any money to watch this deplorable thing, although I still had one small price to pay: the energy wasted in watching it.",Brokeback Mountain
132,gelman@attglobal.net,"Prizes for Ang Lee and Rodrigo Prieto, not the Film",8,30 January 2006,"Okay, I'll admit it up front. Watching two men make love is not my thing. And I find it difficult to believe that a fumbling sexual encounter between a repressed cowboy (Heath Ledger) and a somewhat more eager bisexual cowboy (Jake Gyllenhaal) can lead to a love affair lasting many years through both men's marriages. Heath Ledger does quite a credible job as a silent, tortured cowpoke -- they are actually there to herd sheep, not cattle. But I wouldn't give him the prizes he seem destined to carry off. The photography and the setting are what elevate this movie. Ang Lee and Rodrigo Prieto have taken full advantage of the Wyoming landscape that is at once gorgeous and forbidding. Odd that the all present cowboy movies of a recent generation have become a vehicle for portraying gay relationships. I suspect that the awards this film is certain to earn are mainly for the story line. Hollywood is like that. If it were up to me, ""Brokeback Mountain"" would finish far behind ""Good Night and Good Luck"" for best picture honors and David Strathairn would take the Oscar for best male performance.",Brokeback Mountain
133,grahamsj3,Highly overrated,6,1 August 2006,"This film was greatly overblown. I now wonder why it garnered so many Oscar nominations. It just didn't do much for me. This film is supposed to be this great emotional roller-coaster, but I wasn't able to get involved with the characters very much. I'm not quite sure where it went wrong for me. Perhaps the homosexuality did it, since, in my moral upbringing, that's a terrible sin. The acting wasn't at fault, as it was quite good. The cinematography shows a lot of beautiful scenery and that part was enjoyable. The story is pretty good as well. So I think the problem is just me thinking all the time that these guys are going straight to hell. And it just ruined the film for me. I've heard that if you're not bawling your eyes out at the end of this, you aren't human. Guess I'm a donkey or something, because my eyes were dry. Sorry, it just didn't click for me.",Brokeback Mountain
134,barryrd,Powerful movie of same sex love,9,11 March 2015,"Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall give outstanding performances in this movie about same sex love that goes far beyond much of the rhetoric we hear on the subject. The movie is a story about two human beings who struggle with themselves, their families and the misunderstandings and prejudices of people in their lives. Both Gyllenhall and Ledger shined but I found Ledger's performance more moving because he was in denial about his own nature and continued to put his family before himself throughout the story, causing great personal and mental anguish. At the end he was less withdrawn and came to realize how much Gyllenhall's character meant to him. The dynamics with both families were typical of family conflict aggravated by their secret lives. Ledger and his daughters had a special bond that plays so well in the movie. It was also very interesting that both these men had mastered the alpha male persona that fit in with their frontier environments. Gyllenhall was willing to take risks about approaching other men but Ledger was incapable of acting on his instincts, with the exception of his liaison with Gyllenhall. It was also interesting to see how they handled the romantic interests of females. A truly extraordinary movie, it is a powerful story with a final scene that you will not forget.",Brokeback Mountain
135,Superunknovvn,Beautiful and important movie,8,19 March 2006,"I admit that I walked into the cinema with a few prejudices. Firstly, I was turned off by all the hype around this movie and by all the nay-sayers who begrudged ""Crash""'s Best Motion Picture Of The Year-Oscar. Secondly, because I thought that ""Brokeback Mountain"" was praised more for the delicate subject it deals with than for its actual execution. Well, roughly two hours later I left the theatre disabused.""Brokeback Mountain"" avoids all the traps it could easily have fallen into. It's neither affectedly dramatic, nor is it a sweetened romance à la ""Titanic"". Instead it's a genuinely tragic story of two men who have to suppress their feelings for each other, because they can't escape the conventions of their time and their milieu. Not every bit of the story is pointed out, certain plot points are only hinted at, which underlines once again that this movie is for thinking people.Ang Lee's direction is candid and unobtrusive. It's admirable that an Asian director can portray primal-American culture so well. Lee definitely deserved his Oscar (although I still think Woody Allen should at least have gotten a nomination for his direction in ""Match Point"").Ledger and Gyllenhall were very convincing and natural in their roles and - just on a side note - I thought the make-up artists did an incredible job letting Ennis and Jack age.So, yes, it's true. ""Brokeback Mountain"" was the most important movie in 2005. Not just because of its message, but also because of the compelling way it was conveyed.",Brokeback Mountain

Because even I,who won't give a chance to gay films unless it's The Birdcage or Bruno. But even I couldn't deny how good Brokeback mountain was.Ledger and Gylenhaal, in their Oscar nominated performances, played Ennis and Jack, two cowboys who fall for each other while trying to get a job offer. As years go on, their love still remains a secret as they both marry women.It's okay to enjoy a film about gays. People may look at you in a weird way for it. But screw them. Some people believed it deserved best film of the year over Crash. Well, i'm not one of those people because Crash was the underdog masterpiece. I thought it was the best movie of 2005.The acting from everyone is terrific. I think that Gylenhaal gives the best performance. If he wouldn't have been in The Dark knight, this would've been his best performance. Michelle Williams, who married Ledger in real life and in the film, does a very good performance as a wife who witnesses her husband making out with a man.I never wanted to give this film a chance.

137,MattyGibbs,Outstanding,10,18 May 2013,"I remember watching this for the first time and disliking it. For some reason (thankfully) a few years later I re-watched it and felt completely the opposite. Quite why I didn't like it first time i'm not sure, but it has since become one of my favourite films. It's a simple story of the forbidden love between two men in the tough American West. It's a brave film as on the surface a film about gay cowboys is not going to be everyone's first choice of viewing. However thankfully just like life nothing is ever clear cut. Even after watching it's not really clear ( to me anyway) if both men are even gay or just have an attraction to just each other.The only way this film could succeed was by a good script and great performances and what it got was a great script and superlative performances. I have rarely if ever seen such a towering but understated performance as that of Heath Ledger in this. How he did not pick up an Oscar for this i'm not sure. He is backed by a very strong young cast. Jake Gyllenhaal has the lesser role but is almost as impressive as Heath Ledger and the two supporting female leads Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway are excellent. I would suggest that this is the career high for all concerned ( apart maybe from Jake Gyllenhaal who was superb in Zodiac). The cinematography is incredible and you get a real sense of the vastness of the American wilderness. The plot meanders at it's own pace but you are so spellbound at what you are watching it never drags. Much has been made of the infamous sex scene but whilst as a straight man I can't say I wasn't uncomfortable watching it, it is necessary and it is handled very well. This is without doubt a classic movie and one of the best movies of all time in my opinion. It's a shame it hasn't got a higher rating than 7.7 on here as it easily deserves a Top 250 place but sadly I guess the films content stops it achieving it's rightful place.",Brokeback Mountain
138,Isaac5855,An Epic Cinematic Masterpiece,9,8 January 2007,"BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a masterpiece of storytelling that takes some uncomfortable topics and situations and places them in the context of a moving and beautiful story. This is the story of Ennis Delmar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal), two cowboys whose isolated summer sheepherding assignment turns them from strangers to friends to lovers in the matter of couple of months. After their assignment is over they are separated for four years, in which time they both marry and have children. They are then reunited and it's like no time has passed at all. Unfortunately, Ennis' wife, Alma (Michelle Williams)witnesses their passionate reunion and chooses to live with the secret instead of confronting Ennis. What we then see is two people who seem to genuinely love each other, kept apart by circumstance. The word love never passes between Ennis and Jack. Ennis calls it ""this thing."" The men claim to be straight after their first encounter (though I have my doubts about Jack). The words ""gay"" or ""homosexual"" appear nowhere in the screenplay, though the word ""queer"" is used once. What we see more than the passion these men share when they're together is the passion they long for when they are apart. Ang Lee's sensitive and detailed Oscar-winning direction captures every nuance of emotion and passion between these two men without preaching to us or taking a stand on the underlying issues here. Ledger and Gyllenhaal give breathtaking, Oscar-worthy performances and receive solid support from Williams as Alma and Anne Hathaway as Jack's wife, Lorene. For me, this movie is above everything else, a love story, a beautiful, moving, emotionally charged love story where the protagonists just happen to be men.",Brokeback Mountain

Actually Philadelphia is one of my favorite dramas and i thought it dealt with the homosexuality issue very well. This film just didn't appeal to me, because although the characters were interesting and it was obvious that i would have understood much more if i had read the book, the flow of the film, the events and style of direction were all just too slow and bland for my liking. I was uninterested part of the time, the dialogues were decent, i thought Ledger did better with the acting than Gyllenhaal, which was surprising as i don't consider Ledger the better actor.

141,DonFishies,"Much more than just a ""gay"" love story",9,22 January 2006,"Well, the front runner for Oscar gold finally came our way, and I took full advantage of it. And well, I can't say I wasn't surprised, because I was much more than that.Yes, it's about gay cowboys. Yes, it contains male nudity (there is some female nudity to boot however). Yes, they do make out. Yes, there is male on-screen sex. Yes, I mean what I'm saying. And yes, I did accidentally cough when they first start making out.But it's much more than a love story about gay cowboys. It's a heartbreaking story about a friendship that is much more than just that, yet can't go any further because of social standards. They know they can't be together, and so does the audience. The most depressing scenes in the movie (its filled with them), just tear at your heart and really make you feel like this movie should be accepted as much more than a typical love story. Or as a gay love story for that matter.The scenery is beautiful, and some of the dialog is just fantastic. Ang Lee's direction is astonishing, and the way the actors come to the material is just marvelous to watch. Heath (even with his annoying accent) and Jake give Oscar worthy performances, while Michelle and Anne may be up there in the limelight a whole lot more if there was just more of them in the actual film. Because its all about Heath and Jake, the whole female presence gets cut right off (in the 135 minute-odd movie, anything that isn't male doesn't show up until at least 40 minutes in). While this isn't necessarily a bad thing, you just really notice how little scenery either get to really chew. Michelle gets more than Anne, but their performances still come out to being about equal.But another thing you notice is while the years in the film are moving by at break-neck speeds, the movie has a serious issue with slowness. The whole movie is just fantastic, but its bogged down with long tracking shots, and long bits of unneeded scenery or dialog. It could have easily had at least 15 minutes excised, and it would be the same if not even better. And like I said earlier, the movie is horribly depressing. I did not expect nearly as much heartbreak and tragedy as I got, but then again, I doubt anyone else did either, and that's why it is cleaning house at all the award shows.Overall, I wouldn't be upset about it winning Best Picture, but then find myself knowing there were at least 2 movies better than it this past year.9/10.",Brokeback Mountain
142,moviesleuth2,A groundbreaking and important film,10,12 December 2009,"Homosexuality has been depicted in films for ages, but typically it is used as a subplot or a buried secret. This is especially true of mainstream films (before ""Brokeback Mountain,"" no film in wide release dealt openly about homosexuality). Ang Lee's courageous film finally brings homosexuality out into the open. With it, it brings to light the fears and feelings that many people face, but most don't know or understand.Ennis del Mar (the late great Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) meet in the summer of 1963 working as sheep herders for Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid). But the more time they spend together, the more they realize that a mutual attraction is growing between them. Both recognize the love that they feel for each other, but this is 1963, and such a relationship can have consequences. They agree that this was a one time thing, but staying away from each other is harder than they think.For a film that is intended to break new ground and open a lot of doors for discussion, it has to be good. And ""Brokeback Mountain"" is excellent.The performances are superb. Without a doubt, the beating heart of the film is the romance between Ennis and Jack, and Ledger and Gyllenhaal are more than up to the task. Ennis is the central character. He knows what he feels, but his fears and need to keep a level of normalcy keeps him from acting on it. Ledger is nothing short of incredible in his performance. I haven't seen ""Capote,"" but quite honestly, Philip Seymour Hoffman must have been REALLY good to steal the Best Actor Oscar from Ledger (interesting note: some claimed that Ledger had more work to do, as he created a lot of Ennis's qualities from nothing, while Hoffman merely mimicked Capote). Ledger creates a truly memorable character that everyone (straight, gay, bi, in the closet) can identify with. Jake Gyllenhaal matches Ledger beat for beat. Like Ennis, Jack is a little confused by his feelings, but unlike Ennis, he is not tortured by fear and insecurity. He knows what he wants, and is content to get it; his only obstacle is to convince Ennis to join him.The female actresses are just as good, although their roles are strictly supporting. Michelle Williams is solid, although her Oscar nod was a little surprising; her part is pretty small and her development is stunted to make room for the Jack/Ennis romance. Williams plays Alma, Ennis' wife. She loves her husband, but she wonders why Ennis never comes back from his fishing trips with any fish, even though she asked him. In my opinion, Anne Hathaway should have gotten her first Oscar nod here. She instantly sheds off her Disney past as Lureen, Jack's self-absorbed wife. Lureen is so caught up in her own life that she doesn't even begin to notice anything strange going on about her husband's frequent trips up north. Linda Cardellini is excellent as Cassie, the waitress who falls for Ennis. But he's so conflicted by his own feelings that he alienates not only her, but everyone else. Anna Faris is unrecognizable as Lureen's chatterbox friend.Ang Lee is hailed as one of the greatest modern filmmakers around, and rightly so. He has created two masterpieces, and his other works are not far behind. If you look at his resume, you'll notice that none of his films are in any way related to each other. Lee has tremendous versatility, and he refuses to be confined to one type of genre, which I highly value. Although Lee got his long overdue Oscar for ""Brokeback Mountain,"" this is neither his best film nor his best directing. Lee has been known for his subtlety, and while that often works in his films, it doesn't quite make the mark here. We understand the emotions that the characters are feeling, but the film is so subtle that we can barely feel them, if at all. Part of the reason is that he brings every scene out equally. The main story is the Jack/Ennis relationship. But Lee brings the other scenes out to the same level, and while they work on their own, one scene's effectiveness comes at the cost of the other.Four years after the release of the film, it is obvious that ""Brokeback Mountain's"" goals have been achieved. It opened a lot of doors for discussion, and it was widely seen. But did it get to the people that really needed to see it? One of the problems in our society today in terms of LGBT rights is the stigma attached to homosexuality. The stereotype of gay men as being effeminate or ""emo"" is everywhere, and I think that really hampers the acceptance of it by some men. ""Brokeback Mountain"" addresses this social stigma in a way that should be enlightening. So if you think that being gay is not ""manly,"" see it. It will change your perception of gay men. As for those who are turned off by it being a romance, I'd like to quote Richard Roeper (though in a different context): Get over it. Yes, it's a romance, but sappy, it is not. This is not ""The Notebook,"" nor ""Titanic,"" despite the associations with it. Besides, it's 2.5 hours. What have you got to lose? There is no doubt that this was the most talked about film of 2005. After viewing the film, I think this is based not so much on quality, but because of what it means to society. Don't get me wrong, this is a wonderful film. But it's not perfect. Being socially liberal, I was disappointed at its loss to ""Crash."" After viewing the film twice, I have to admit that ""Crash"" is an overall better film. But in all honesty, no one is really going to remember ""Crash"" in a few years. However, they will remember ""Brokeback Mountain"" because of its importance. And really, that's all that matters.",Brokeback Mountain

145,museumofdave,"Should Love Always Be A Reasoned Choice? Whose Life Is It, Anyway?",10,8 April 2013,"One of the problems with watching this film for the first time is all the baggage that has already loaded onto it--all the controversy, all the various agendas that viewers bring to it; So many people who watch this film seem to have already prepared themselves to watch a different film--that is, they want a traditional love story, or they hope for more action, or want a Gay entitlement film or they expect it to be a conventional Western in ways that it is not. I think that the fascinating appeal of this film is that it can shoehorn itself into several genres and still come out ahead.I saw this film for the first time several days ago, and am still haunted by the repression forced on both leading men by a traditional small-town life, by expected values and early childhood experiences, by grinding poverty that gives them very little with which to enrich themselves.Who knows why we pick the people we really love, and even today, except on television talk shows, how easy is it to confess even to ourselves why we sometimes choose to be reasonable instead of passionate?The contrasts in this film between the great freedom of expansive, forested vistas and the cramped rented trailers where physical needs and emotional wounds are nursed are strong, and the performances persuasive. Brokeback Mountain has obviously touched lives in many ways, else how to explain the more than 2,000 reviews of the film on this site? I think this is a challenging film, and if you're looking to be lightly entertained, look elsewhere.",Brokeback Mountain
146,WriterDave,It Is What it Is....,7,8 May 2006,"Postcard perfect cinematography and impeccable direction (Ang Lee deservedly won his Academy ""Reward"" for this film, as it sits nicely alongside his more potent ""Ice Storm"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" to put him near the top of the cream of the crop of modern directors) highlight this film about gay cowboy romance in 1960's Wyoming.Plotting and character development are glacially paced to the point of banality in the early portion of the film as the melodrama slowly unfolds into a sappy star-crossed romance amidst gorgeous mountain scenery. The drama really heats up in the middle portions of the film as our two lovers (a very good Heath Ledger as Ennis and a slightly annoying Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack) try to hide their true feelings and lead normal lives with wives and children. It's interesting to watch how the repression manifests itself differently in the characters' lives, as Jack's pent up frustration allows him to finally stand up to an oppressive father-in-law while meeting with other men on the side keeping both his wife and Ennis completely blind, while Ennis' repression leads to a complete disintegration of his life highlighted in powerful scenes with Michelle Williams as his all too-knowing wife as she delivers a shockingly raw and emotive performance.The film lurches on into its strained later portions as it becomes painfully clear to even the most patient viewer that this was based on a short story. The flawless direction of Lee and some delightful cameos (with Linda Cardellini very effective as Ennis' later-day waitress girlfriend and Anna Farris serving some comic relief as a loquacious ranching high society Texan) keep the film engaging. However, it eventually deteriorates into the art-house equivalent of a Nicholas Sparks' adaptation complete with dialogue more memorable for its unintended comedy than for any deeply moving undercurrent, which is why I suspect the film succeeded so well with mainstream female audiences. Unfortunately it left this movie lover wishing for something a bit more meaningful.",Brokeback Mountain
147,LoneWolfAndCub,"Moving, Unforgettable and Painful",10,19 December 2007,"This is not a movie about homosexuals, this is a movie about pure love. It doesn't matter how many people call this a ""gay cowboy movie"" or shun it for featuring two men in love, this is one of the best movies ever made. Not only that, it is one of the truest movies you will ever see. Ang Lee is probably the best modern director, not only is this movie a masterpiece, but most of his others are as well (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Ice Storm). He is not afraid to approach a story which has a touchy issue and film it with such beauty that it considerably moved this reviewer. But Lee is one of the many involved in this movie who did an amazing job.All the actors did such a fantastic job it is hard to say who is best. Ultimately, though, Heath Ledger carries this movie with his best performance as Ennis Del Mar. Ledger's performance is not only his best but one of the best period. Anyone who watches this can not deny Ledger's phenomenal job. However, it would not be fair to dismiss the three other actors who were also brilliant. Jake Gyllenhaal is Jack Twist, a heart-wrenchingly sad character who falls in love with Ennis. Much like Ledger, this is another career best. These two actors took on two of the hardest roles one could take on and from them gave two moving and unforgettable performances. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway are the two supports and both are perfect. Michelle Williams' Alma is such a sad character it's hard not to feel for her and Hathaway's Lureen is a strong but in the end broken women it is likewise not hard to feel for her. Both ladies are amazing.Now to the writers, these amazing people who have created the best story to be put onto the big screen in years. It is so real, so beautiful and so sad. Yet, it seems so simple. Two men, Ennis (a ranch hand) and Jack (a rodeo cowboy) who after spending a summer together sheep-herding for a lifelong connection which is really love. Although they go their separate ways and marry and have kids they realise the true depth of their love.Along with a touching and moving score and some beautiful shots of mountains and the country this is ultimately the most affecting and touching movie that has come in awhile and will likely be remembered and revered as one of the greatest films ever made.5/5",Brokeback Mountain
148,Antagonisten,A must-see,8,8 March 2006,"It took me a while before i got to see ""Brokeback Mountain"", and saying that expectations were high is an understatement. Raving reviews, Oscars and Ang Lee's track-record said that this should be something out of the ordinary. And it was.Movies about forbidden and impossible love is nothing new. Usually it's between a man and a woman, separated by perhaps family, culture or other such boundaries. Here instead it's two men facing that cultural boundary. A love that society can not and will not accept or understand. In my opinion the greatness of this movie is that it manages to feed the viewer both hope and desperation, both happiness and sadness. Happiness that there is love in the world despite the obstacles, sadness that small things should be allowed to get in the way of people's happiness.I'm quite surprised really that this movie has become so intensely popular despite it's, in many parts of the world at least, controversial subject. But i'm happily surprised. And ""Brokeback Mountain"" is worth watching for so many reasons. The beautiful imagery, the flawless direction from Ang Lee, the powerful acting from especially Heath Ledger. And of course the amazing story. Definitely one of the best movies of 2005 and a must-see.",Brokeback Mountain
149,Laakbaar,"Profound, cathartic, important",10,2 March 2014,"This is a beautiful, simple film about a lifelong romance between two closeted men raised in a homophobic culture. Yes, it's a movie about coming out of the closet and about homophobia, but more importantly it's a movie about finding true love and being true to your feelings.The morning after their passion erupts, they tell each other they're not gay. The second night, they embrace once again and accept what they are. This is the true coming out. No, it's not just about sex.It is crucial that this movie was shot in God's country, and the love that burst through here occurred between two attractive, masculine men in the prime of their lives. Gay love is everywhere and it will always find its way out.All relationships are different. The story of what happened to Ennis and Jack is particular to them and not true for all gay men. Both of them were unable to complete the process properly (after all, it was 1963), but Ennis in particular was almost crippled by his mental blocks and social constructs. His closet became of his own making. Thankfully most in the West now don't have so much difficulty with it. What rang true in the movie were the powerful and painful experiences of coming out, finding love and fighting prejudice. It's unbearably sad that self-hatred and homophobia have choked so many millions of people from leading fulfilling lives. In a sense, this movie is a clarion call for perhaps the greatest liberation movement in modern times. This movie said to me: all the sh*t you put up with, all the things you missed out on, all the difficulties and disappointments -- it was worth it because what matters most is Brokeback Mountain.This movie touched me deeply. The second time I saw it, the ending was so moving to me that I started weepinguncontrollably. I kept crying during my walk home from the theatre. The floodgates really burst when I finally got home. How do you explain that? Catharsis? I still don't understand why this movie had this effect on me. No movie has ever done that to me before or since. The final scene with Ennis and Jack's jacket (""Jack, I swear..."") is the most powerful image of lost love ever put on film. Heath, thank you.Not all gay stories are sad. Many gay men live happy, joyous lives without regret or trauma. For many of us, Ennis and Jack make it work.How can I rate this movie anything less than 10? Thank you Annie, Ang, Larry and Diana. And perhaps most of all, thank you Jake.",Brokeback Mountain

151,ronakkotian,Ledger and Gyllenhaal shine in this tragic love story.,9,15 January 2021,"Ang Lee is a director who has a very mixed filmography. From great films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Life of Pi to terrible movies like Hulk and Gemini Man, Ang Lee is hit or miss but thankfully Brokeback Mountain falls into the former category.Brokeback Mountain follows Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, two cowboys that develop an intimate relationship with each other and the struggle they face due to the times they live in.This film really shows Ang Lee's talent as a director and how amazing Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are as actors. This is a deeply saddening film about a tragic love story and the film manages to pull on your heartstrings till the very end. The film takes place over a 20 year period as we see the constant battles both Ennis and Jack are facing. Amongst the gorgeous scenery, Lee handles a subject matter like this with immense care and leaves each scene with tons of emotion whether it's happy or sad. I also really loved the score which helped communicate the way characters were feeling but it wasn't overused to the point where it was telling you how to feel during a certain scene. The screenplay from Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana examines the time period the characters lived in and communicated the range of emotions they were feeling brilliantly.Heath Ledger delivers a monumental performance as Ennis Del Mar. There are so many layers and nuance to the character and Ledger pours his heart and soul into the role. It's sad that a talent like him had to pass away so soon. Jake Gyllenhaal has always taken risks as an actor and has played many different characters but Jack Twist is one of his best. I really felt the frustration he was feeling and the desire he had to make this relationship work. It's yet another phenomenal performance by him. The supporting actors are also really good especially Michelle Williams.Brokeback Mountain is a heartbreaking love story filled with Oscarworthy performances from Ledger and Gyllenhaal. It's a great examination of the loneliness and struggle of being in a relationship that was forbidden at the time that ends in a way that's sure to leave tears streaming down your face.",Brokeback Mountain
152,MichaelMargetis,"""Bottom line is... we're around each other an'... this thing, it grabs hold of us again... at the wrong place... at the wrong time... and we're dead. "" - Ennis",10,6 January 2006,"It seems as though whenever the subject of 'Brokeback Mountain' comes up almost everyone is quick to make jokes. 'Fudgepack Mountain', 'Bareback Mountain', 'Breaking My Back on a Mountain', etc. To be honest, I felt the idea of a film about two gay cowboys was flat-out stupid. I mean it's perfect bait for a Saturday Night Live skit. Then about a month before release I heard all these incredible rave reviews from film critics across the globe. The New York Film Critics and Los Angeles Film Critics both named it the 'Best Film of 2005'. The most negative review I read of 'Brokeback' was a '3 stars out of 4 stars' review. I couldn't believe it, and I had to see it. If everyone was raving about this film, I knew I had to see it so I could have an opinion about it. I went with my sister's fiancé, Mike. We are both straight, but we were able to put the mild homophobia we shared behind us and enjoy the film. I personally went into it thinking it was going to be pure graphic and explicit gay sex the movie critics panned as brilliant to be what every asshole in Hollywood is -- ""politically correct."" But let me tell you something, when those ending credits started to roll I thought to myself, ""My god, was I wrong!"" I knew at that moment I just viewed a beautifully crafted masterpiece with some of finest ensemble acting I've seen in years. 'Brokeback Mountain' will move most people emotionally no matter what orientation, race or creed.A common mis-conception about 'Brokeback Mountain' is that it is the gay cowboy movie. It's not, really. Deep down, it's a film about love and real life. The film doesn't distinguish gay and straight and 50% of the love agony is from straight relationships. 'Brokeback' is a portrait of four very unhappy people trying to find true love and more importantly happiness. Ennis can't find happiness with Alma since he can never have the same love for her as he does Jack, and Alma can't find happiness with her 'gay' husband because he's gay. (same thing with Jack's wife). 'Brokeback Mountain' rises above the labeling of 'gay', 'straight', or 'bi' and just labels these people as 'humans'. It preaches a positive message that love isn't just about straightness, gayness or even sex. Love is a force of nature, like the slogan of the film says, and it cannot be controlled. This is a message everyone can get no matter what orientation or social backgrounds.From a technical stand-point 'Brokeback Mountain' is all the more brilliant. Ang Lee (who has previous shown his diversity from going from a film like 'Sense and Sensibility' to 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon) even furthers his range with this. When you think a movie surrounding issues stemming from homosexuality, the last film director that comes to mind is Ang Lee, a straight Asian film director. However, Ang Lee provides us with excellent and eye-popping direction capturing some of the most beautiful sites on screen, the beautiful mountain-range and country scenery is undeniably breathtaking. Lee also does a masterful job capturing the actor's emotions which are even more brilliant than the dialogue. Not to take anything away from the writing, 'Brokeback Mountain' has a rich, multi-layered and complicated screenplay that will no doubt win the 'Best Adapted Screenplay' Oscar come March. IThe best aspect about this motion picture in my opinion, however, is the acting. Heath Ledger gives a performance so exquisite and indescribably powerful that it reminds me of previous work from a young Brando or DeNiro. What shocked me most about the movie was Ledger's capability to engage you through the entire runtime and make it seem so natural. You know an actor is ingenious in their craft when they can make it seem easy. In a less awe-inspiring role, Jake Gyllenhaal is outstanding to say the absolute least as the tortured soul that is Jack Twist, who yearns more than anyone else in the film to be happy. Gyllenhaal and Ledger steal the entire film from the ladies, but Michelle Williams still manages to move audiences with her compelling portrayal of Alma , a woman who does the best with knowing her husband is gay, while Anne Hathaway who was previously known for less than impressive work in 'The Princess Diaries' opens us up to a whole new side of her with a performance that is quiet yet first-rate none-the-less.I recommend 'Brokeback Mountain' to people who admire excellent and innovative cinema like I do, and for people who can excuse some gay scenes for one remarkable film. I went into 'Brokeback Mountain' figuring I'd get some material for jokes but what I got was a masterpiece and a lump in my throat which lasted an entire hour. I predict this will go down in film history as a classic. Grade: A (screened at Harkins Camelview 5, Scottsadle, Arizona, 1/2/06)",Brokeback Mountain
153,departed07,Such a sad but beautiful movie,9,20 May 2008,"When I first heard about ""Brokeback Mountain"" in 2005, there was buzz all over the place from critics and moviegoers alike who lauded the movie for being a risk taker while at the same time being the pun of jokes on comedy and late night talk shows because of the subject of having two gay cowboy lovers. My first reaction in watching the movie on HBO almost made me want to giggle in remembrance to the jokes, but it wasn't until five minutes later where I wasn't laughing anymore as I followed the story and kept my mouth shut.Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) are looking for work at a cattle ranch in the late 1960's where they have to take a flock of sheep from one part of the ranch to another without having too many or losing any of the creatures. From there they start a bond where one night the bond starts to deepen where Jack falls for Ennis but not before being pushed into sex which they agree to only do so in the tent and not say a word about it to anybody.Years later after the little stunt, Ennis and Jack go their separate lives where both of them are married to women and have families. Jack is working in a business that his wife's father owns while Ennis is working odd jobs just to make ends meet and still remember his pride as a man but nothing could stop them from falling for one another where they try secretly to meet with each other until realizing that their secret relation is damaging their lives and those that surround them.Ang Lee directs this movie where even though I'm familiar with some of his action works in ""Hulk"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" the film is what Roger Ebert said about most of Lee's films, including this one, that it's about misguided characters who deal with consequences.The performances are outstanding, especially by the two male leads (Ledger and Gyllenhaal) who prove that they could step outside the teen movies and show serious acting. The same goes for the female performances as well from Michelle Williams who plays Alma, Ennis's wife and Anna Hathaway, who breaks out of her Disney Princess Diaries shell, to play Gyllenhaal's wife Lureen Newsome.This film won't appeal to everybody, including those who were raised by moral ethics, but it proves that a non-American director and four former teenage actors can show what they have to make a great movie.",Brokeback Mountain
154,andrewroy-04316,"Moving and poignant, Brokeback will break your heart",9,29 January 2021,"I don't know why it took me so long to watch Brokeback, a universally acclaimed film with two of my favorite actors starring in it, but I am so glad to have watched it. Brokeback Mountain prioritizes a grounded tone and atmosphere over dramatic dialogue and flashy shots. This is a story concerned with the harsh truths of reality, and of humans grappling with their passions. Coming into it, I would have never expected it to be such a film, but in a way it works as a film about passion and how people grapple with being unable to do the thing they love. I love the script and Ang Lee's direction. From the opening shot, it's clear that dialogue will not be added for the sake of it - people react to each other subtly and don't go on dramatic, unrealistic rants or one-liners. It's an intimate and ultimately quite simple story of two men grappling with the conflicting forces of their love for each other and the risks their love carries. Lee maintains a narrow and deep focus on this fundamental question by richly developing both characters, from their mannerisms to their home lives to their moments of weakness. As you would expect, both Gyllenhaal and Ledger are truly exceptional, with Gyllenhaal playing a vulnerable man and Ledger a subtle and quiet one. The supporting performances are solid across the board, with Williams and Cardellini particularly impressing in their struggles to relate to Ennis. The score perfectly suits the hopeful yet somber tone of the film, and the cinematography is gorgeous. This is an impeccably crafted film with not a second or word wasted. Every moment is atmospheric and you feel these characters deeply for every second. An early candidate for the best film I'll watch this year, I am blown away by Brokeback Mountain.",Brokeback Mountain
155,ClaytonDavis,BM plays all the right chords....,8,10 December 2005,"Brokeback Mountain Ang Lee, the director of the masterpieces ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" ""Sense and Sensibility,"" and ""The Ice Storm"" has really provided a powerful message to all who experience this wonderful film called Brokeback Mountain. But let me just stop there and tell you that I didn't love it like the rest of the world has been. The heart of the film is in its performances and direction by Lee. There have been rumors flying about stating that this is the greatest love story ever told and it has the power to transform the most conservative hearts. Well, as a liberal I will go on the notion that this isn't that great of a love story.We watch the progression of these two characters, Jack Twist and Ennis del Mar from two lost young adults whom find comfort in one another one summer and start down a path either of them could have expected. Ennis who is played stunningly by Heath Ledger is a man who is entirely reserved. Jack Twist who is played by the no less than perfect Jake Gyllenhaal is an extroverted charismatic individual who's looking for himself.These two young men just don't fall in love and that's it. The relationship starts off as a very lustful one with the only thing between them is attraction and sexual frustration. Up until the last twenty or so minutes of the film I never really feel the love between them. I might have been expecting too much out of the film and that's why I felt a little disappointed but its still impressive. The sheer bravery that Ang Lee has in making a film about homosexual cowboys in our very conservative day and age is striking. But let me say this To me, this film has nothing to do with homosexuality. The subject at hand is homosexuality but that is not what the film is about. Its about self-acceptance and courage. Trying to find a place in a world that has told you that you are wrong. We all make different choices when an obstacle is before us. Some of us choose to live or be in solitude, not talk to anyone whilst others keep themselves occupied. Most people want to face the problem face to face but are often reluctant to do so. This film gets the chip off your shoulder and makes you stop being afraid of who you were born to be. Fear is the enemy here not people. Love is the key to freedom and with that comes sacrifice and caution but with love at the center all falls into place. Okay, enough with the messages and themes and let's get on with the review of the film.This year's best picture race is totally wide open. Even though this film seems like the likely winner at this point, it just doesn't have that one thing that best picture winners are made of. What is it? Not sure at all at this point; the story tugs at your heart like previous winners (Million Dollar Baby, Forrest Gump) but this film moves very fast in its two hours and sixteen minutes. We span over 20 years in this time. That's a lot of ground to cover. Maybe that's where BM just went wrong. Lee should of just bite the bullet and make it three hours or so, I mean hey, those win best pictures too. (Braveheart, Titanic, Return of the King) Ledger as stated gives a stunning portrayal and I expect him to be a nominee this year. This subtle performance yet so strikingly moving is what gets people to the Oscars. Gyllenhaal whom is the heart and soul of the film will definitely make it to Oscar. When I was watching the film I suddenly got a vision of him standing at the podium accepting his supporting actor award but then I came to my senses and realized that won't happen with a snubbed man like Paul Giamatti around. Michelle Williams who plays Mrs. Alma del Mar has the right hand to play her way to March. The suffering wife is an academy favorite and you really feel for her character throughout the film. So that's three acting nominations you say, and that is correct. We will see BM in the picture, director, actor, supporting actor and actress, adapted screenplay and probably some more. This was a really good film and even though it may not win the top prize there is no denying the MVP of the film is Mr. Lee. After his loss to Soderbergh this will be his makeup Oscar for directing and he truly deserves it. He took us to a place no one would dare and made you feel for these men. I wish the depiction of love could have been better but it was there. Better late than never. The rest of the supporting cast is great with Anne Hathaway as Mrs. Twist who was a little miscast I might say. Anna Faris, Randy Quaid, and the very surprising and very powerful Linda Cardellini were great as well.Brokeback Mountain is a truly captivating and magnificent film. Despite the minor flaws in story, there's no denying the brilliance and courage this film has. There's a Brokeback Mountain for all of us and this film truly makes you want to find it.Grade: ***1/2/****",Brokeback Mountain

How could it not be so when the only reason for making it was to show two gay cowboys on screen. Did we need over two hours for that? Two slow, painful hours?The direction and the photography are classy, but there is nothing else. At best, there is something, an exact copy of a secret heterosexual romance with the predictable pinch of social outcry. So this is why I call it a ""gayxploitation"" movie. The ""Oscar worthy"" performances? Heath Ledger is good but not special and his smoking/spitting thing is rather annoying (okay you desperately want to look genuine, we got it), while Jake Gyllenhaal is miscast. Come on, can you see him as a cowboy? The mustache at the end is so fake that compares only to Johnny Depp's at Donnie Brasco.

Countless romantic comedies or ""chick flicks"" have based the entire story on this premise and nothing else.The producers of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind present an Ang Lee, director of Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Ice Storm, has added a new, controversial film to this genre. Brokeback Mountain is an extremely emotional and intense film about two ranchers who after spending one fateful summer in 1963 together on Brokeback Mountain fall in love.Ennis, played by Heath Ledger (The Patriot), is the roughneck cowboy who is just trying to earn some extra money over the summer. He winds up working with Jack, Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko), a soft-spoken boy who is also looking for a summer job. The two must keep watch over a heard of sheep for three months in the area of Wyoming known as Brokeback Mountain.When a freak blizzard hits, the weather turns cold up on Brokeback and instead of having one sleep in the tent and the other sleeping near the sheep, the two shack up for warmth, but what happens is not what the two expected. In what can only be described as a passionate love scene, is the turning point of the picture.After their engagement is cut short, they say farewell and go their separate ways. The next summer, the employer who gave them the job last summer (Randy Quaid, Independence Day) found out how they were ""passing the time"".Jump to four years later, Ennis has a wife Alma, Michelle Williams (Dick) and two children, living in a cramped apartment. Jack is working with his wife Lureen, Anne Hathaway (The Princess Diaries), selling heavy farm equipment. Jack writes Ennis telling him he is coming down to see him. Upon their meeting, Alma catches the two being a little too familiar with each other. From here on out she must hide his secret without him or their children knowing.The rest of the film features several rendezvous back to Brokeback and the complications their wives create and the world they live in. It spans several years with each year bringing more conflict and hurt. Jack wishes they had never fallen for each other saying, ""I wish I knew how to quit you!"" several times.Lee's direction is stellar to say none-the-less. He uses the panoramic landscape of the Canadian wilderness as his Brokeback Mountain stage. The vivid color is very romantic. It really brings out the emotion and passion emanating from the two actors. Lee's previous works have similar concepts with nature as a great element to have.Ledger and Gyllenhaal, both nominated for Academy Awards (Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor respectively), shine as two men lost in a world that can't accept them as lovers. As they get older, their relationship becomes more and more complicated. The most important part of their acting that makes this movie stand out is they make the story not about gay lovers, but about two lovers. Straight or gay, their acting is so compelling it doesn't matter what their orientation would be.Brokeback Mountain is a modern classic that speaks volumes. It has power beyond explanation. Lee presents a story about love that conquers all boundaries. Thanks to Lee's ambitious film making, the doorway has been opened up for filmmakers everywhere to pursue their dreams.",Brokeback Mountain
160,majikstl,Hide in plain sight...,10,28 December 2005,"BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is the ""gay cowboy movie."" Well, it is and it isn't.For one thing the two protagonists meet while herding sheep, not cattle; but they could just as easily be construction workers, truck drivers, butchers, bakers, candlestick makers or any regular joes who work for a living and are burdened by social expectations, responsibilities and the entire mythos of what it is supposed to take to be a man. As such, what it means to be gay in our still evolving world is absolutely central to what the film is all about, yet totally irrelevant. Gay or straight, the isolation and silent desperation that tortures the two young men in this film are feelings that are more common in males then we usually suspect or would ever like to admit.But homosexuality, especially being gay in rural or working class worlds, intensifies and deepens the burdens. BROKEBACK is about the things men don't talk about -- and not just what two men might do when alone, in the dark and in the throes of passion. BROKEBACK is about fear and pain and vulnerability and loneliness -- all the things that men are told they must swallow and deny if they are to earn the right to be men. The film is a courageous landmark in the depiction of homosexuality in drama, yet it is also a brave and rare examination of what it is to be a man, any man.It is the story of Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal), two wranglers for hire. During a stint minding sheep in the Wyoming highlands -- on Brokeback Mountain in 1963 -- they each discover that the other is not just his one true love, but also his one true friend. They are two lost souls who find each other literally in the middle of nowhere. They bond with an intensity that is rare in friendships and probably just as rare in marriages. They find they can share, not just their passion, but their dreams and their loneliness. The irony is they only feel comfortable and safe embracing their all consuming love out in the open, in the wide open spaces and isolated privacy of God's country. The two can be as one, but only if they remain part of nature, far removed from the rest of the world.But that other world exists and demands that they deny their love by also denying their friendship. Separated by states and states of mind, over the next twenty years they build separate lives and separate families, Ennis in Wyoming and Jack in Texas. But they can't stay apart and they don't do a very good job of hiding their passion. Torn between doing the right thing for their wives and children and doing right by each other, they compromise everyone and everything, including their love.Sparsely written by Larry McMurtry & Diana Ossana from E. Annie Proulx's crusty short story and poetically directed by Ang Lee, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a beautiful blend of the imagery and mythos of the American western with the flavor of European drama. It is acted without pretense by Ledger and Gyllenhaal who capture with understated eloquence the rowdy passion and the frightened tenderness of their characters.As a ""gay"" film, BROKEBACK is a stunning breath of fresh air. Ennis and Jack are not sexual predators or serial killers, they're not preening and prancing promiscuous little disco boys on the make or effete golden boys and they're not puppydog best friends designed to make the liberal main character feel good about herself. They are just average, non-glamorous working class guys who just want the same things out of life as any straight guy: acceptance, family, love. Their sexuality isn't treated as a tragedy or a joke, but as a fact of life. Ennis and Jack are typical working class men, not tiresomely stereotypical gay men.As honest as BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is in dealing with homosexuality, it is just as intent on offering a realistic picture of masculinity. The image of men -- American males in particular -- has been progressively denigrated in our society; men are demonized as abusers and wife beaters by the feminists and trivialized into ugly, violent, macho jokes by our Quentin Tarantino influenced media. The film was greeted with worries that straight men would not be able to relate to a gay love story, but the sympathetic vision of masculinity it proffers transcends questions of orientation.Few films do a better job of illustrating the buried passions of the average man. Replace the gay narrative with feelings of unrequited passion to travel or create or succeed or just to escape, and much of what BROKEBACK deals with is universal. Ennis and Jack don't have to be gay for the story to work -- no more than Butch and Sundance or even Thelma and Louise -- but the passion and eroticism of their love, stated clearly and without innuendo, somehow make the other themes more pure and profound. They are social outlaws of victimless crimes.The film deserves a place among the ranks of the best of the traditional westerns. It offers an extension of the gay subtext found in such film as RED RIVER, THE OUTLAW and BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID, but it also embraces the camaraderie between men and the communion with nature that is at the heart of the entire cowboy mythology. The film recognizes parallels between the solitary lives that often are part of being a cowboy or being gay, lives often lived just outside mainstream society. It is not a question of lifestyles, but about lives lived by different sets of rules.",Brokeback Mountain
161,wrlang,Great work Ang Lee,10,25 December 2006,"Brokeback Mountain is a remake of Same Time Next Year replacing comedy with social commentary and replacing Alda and Burstyn with two gay cowboys in an era that chooses not to understand. I didn't pick this film up until now because I really wasn't interested in the plot. I heard the Ang Lee was a great director, so Starting in 1963, two young cowboys start a relationship and then hide their love for each other over 20 years. They get married to women, have children, function as heterosexuals, and meet at brokeback mountain periodically over the years. You'll need to watch it to find out how everything turns out. Many cliché reactions and scenes riddle the film as they try to keep in the closet. Little mention of the Neanderthal reactions most other people have, but you get the impression they are always in fear for their lives should they be found out. And rightly so in the backward areas of the country they live in. While I personally couldn't watch the few gay love scenes, the story had a great deal of emotion and the characters and situations were very believable. An excellent film that has very high marks from me for everything.",Brokeback Mountain
162,Mehki_Girl,Meh,5,27 March 2021,"I didn't feel whatever it is everyone else is claiming to feel about this movie.The two main characters didn't really have chemistry. I didn't feel they're supposed heartbreak.All I saw were two people, sneaking around, one of whom was cheating on his wife and was rather cold toward his lover.I felt sorry for the wife. Come clean, so your bewildered wife could get on with her life. Leave your small narrow-minded town and move to gay-friendly San Francisco. Case closed.",Brokeback Mountain
163,alicecbr,"With all those sheep, why would you choose another man?",10,6 January 2006,"Sometimes the dark recesses of my grandmotherly mind surprise me. As a liberal with 2 homosexual cousins who are outstanding members of society and a resident of the only state to allow homosexual marriage, I had a strange reaction. The cinematography in this movie is so outstanding, you have to think, ""How could a wife with 2 crying babies compete with this splendor?"" I know better of course, as I hope you do, as well.Is 'stemming the rose' an expression I'm supposed to know? I didn't, but Randy Quaid delivered it well. 'Coach' also did an excellent, completely opposite to his usual roles, portrayal as the father of one of the boys. Having just seen ""The Knight's Tale"" on TV, the golden-haired jousting knight was not discernible in this mumbling, shy cowboy.The script was exquisite: ""When you ain't got nothing, you don't need nothing."" ""What you can't change, you have to stand."" See it twice to be sure you get all the finely tuned phrases, spoken roughly and haltingly, torn from their anguished souls. The subplots rang true, especially that showing the relationship between one of the daughters and Ennis. The actress does a great job of showing the genetic similarity of the daughter to the father, polite and shy.One question: Was this script written BEFORE the boy was murdered in Wisconsin/Montana/Wyoming (I forget which state), left to die on a fence after being beaten so severely? Both those wives were portrayed understatedly, showing by a look their growing awareness of their husband's 'condition'. The scene in which the divorced wife attacks her ex in the kitchen actually made me fear for his safety. But still, so repressed were they at the time that they couldn't even give voice to the specific 'charge'. Beautifully expressed in halting voices or hard nervous looks.Bravery, a 'manly' virtue, is shown every day of a homosexual male's life. By being 'out' in a hate-filled society such as ours that is always looking for a scapegoat, they risk humiliation, ridicule and physical danger daily...depending on their environment. One of my cousins has lived a terribly repressed life alone, because he has been so afraid of the repercussions from outing himself. That's why I was so thankful for the episode that showed this bravery, as the farm equipment salesman, Jack Twist, stands down his overbearing father-in-law (also his employer) in a Thanksgiving turkey carving, TV-clicking drawdown.Another remarkable aspect of the script was that the author used two completely non-stereotypical men to show how they lived with their homosexuality...without the protective enclosure offered to urban homosexuals by their well-educated, cultured fellows... making the movie even more powerful.As homophobic as our society is, even in Ma., I'm amazed at the reception to this movie. I've noticed that sometimes the public shies away from such movies as ""Good Night and Good Luck"", equally excellent in script, photography, acting but dealing with the moral rot of McCarthyism which we're having a recurrence of. Even some critics mistake the SUBJECT matter for the movie components in making their judgments, or let their biases toward the subject matter shade their opinion of the movie itself. That's not been true in this case.Still, I had to watch this movie in an 'arts' theatre, the Landmark Embassy, not one of the multiplexes. This isn't to say that 'Brokeback Mountain' isn't being shown there, just that most movies dealing with homosexuality are shown only in the 'art houses'.If any of you think that we're through with THIS form of prejudice, now that we have Muslims to kick around, come to my town in the bluest of the blue states, Ma. The corrupt Catholic church, loudly proclaiming its ignorance, still preaches against the 'sin' of homosexuality....promoting hatred toward their fellow man. Of course, they can quote the Pope as an authority, but they easily ignore the Pope's sanctions AGAINST capital punishment and this immoral war, fought for greedy corporations. Homophobia is still alive and well, as the kid who committed suicide in Canton a few years ago, could attest to if he were still alive. Some of these haters are trying to get the Ma. legislature to revoke homosexuals' right to marriage, and we have enough hate-filled ignorant voters in this state for it to succeed. Maybe this movie will remind them of the love for our fellow man that Jesus taught us to show, and that pseudo-Christians ignore. See the movie.",Brokeback Mountain
164,gsygsy,a cinematic milestone,10,9 January 2006,"This is a beautiful film. It is full of passion. It is based on a punch-packing short-story which I read a couple of years ago. When I heard who had been cast in the movie version I was sceptical. I shouldn't have been. It staggers me that the members of this young cast have found in themselves the depths of pain that they show. The final scene between Jack and Ennis is heartbreaking. The scenes between Jack's parents (Roberta Maxwell and Peter McRobbie - both superb) and Ennis are devastating. And the scene where Ennis finds what he thought he had lost moves the whole event into the realm of tragedy. Tears are the only option. Heath Ledger is given the difficult task of leading us through this agonising final section, and he delivers in a way that I just can't imagine any other actor of his generation coming anywhere near. Astonishing, unforgettable. Both he and Jake Gyllenhaal seem to be completely unafraid of finding these extremes of love and rage, tenderness and desperation, in themselves. The screenplay is excellent, overcoming every difficulty in the adaptation with skill and sensitivity - it must be one of the most faithful screen adaptations of a work of fiction ever made. The photography is as breathtaking as the scenery it captures. The use of music is exemplary - I can't think of a contemporary movie that deploys its score so tactfully. The whole project has been handled with sensitivity and compassion. It's a great work of art. It's a cinematic milestone. It will stay with me forever. My awed congratulations to all concerned, especially Annie Proulx - wherever did she get this idea?! - and the magnificent Ang Lee.Postcript, 22nd January 2008: RIP, Heath Ledger. Sad, sad news.",Brokeback Mountain
165,dead47548,A modern masterpiece.,10,23 January 2008,"Destined to become an American classic, Brokeback Mountain is a tragic story of painfully forbidden love in a world full of prejudice. The story is compelling and deeply heartbreaking with an ending that leaves me in tears every time. It's such a powerful story that was weaved so perfectly by Annie Proulx and adapted flawlessly by Larry McMurtry. Ang Lee's direction captures the beauty of the scenery (an aspect also captured by the score) and the pain of these characters like no one else could. The story is somehow completely subtle yet absolutely wrenching. Rarely has an ending drained me as much as this one.Of course when talking about the film you have to mention the performances, which are among the best of the decade. Heath Ledger (my win) is shattering as Ennis Del Mar, the more masculine of the couple who fights his love for Jack because of the consequences that society will place upon them. Jake Gyllenhaal is just as wrenching as Jack Twist, the more open of the two who wants nothing more than to be with Ennis for the rest of his life. Michelle Williams is also heartbreaking (a word that I use a lot, but mean every time when discussing the film) as Ennis' first wife, Alma, who discovers their secret and tears herself apart trying to keep her family together. Anne Hathaway and Linda Cardellini also deliver strong performances.On the surface, Brokeback Mountain is simply an emotional story of two forbidden lovers. But in this love story, it weaves the prejudices of American society on homosexuality that is so true of today even though the story takes place a few decades ago. It never blatantly judges society, but in it's story we see the ignorance and absolutely despicable way that people look upon homosexuals. Even in Ennis' denial of his love for Jack we can see this. Overall, it's a wrenching story with some absolutely phenomenal performances. Destined to become a classic and certainly one of my all time favorites.",Brokeback Mountain
166,charchuk,Flawed but well-made,8,22 February 2007,"Very daring flick that gets points for attempting something new, even if it ultimately drags on for too long. It's well-made, but I felt no real connection to these characters, and felt that they weren't really developed effectively. The acting was good, but I felt Gyllenhaal was better than Ledger, who just seemed to mumble a lot, and I found Williams and especially Hathaway surprisingly good in supporting roles. The story never really gets going, and seems fit to meander along until the climax, which doesn't take on the importance it should because the characters aren't built up enough. Still, the film is nice to look at, with sweeping cinematography of the Canadian Rockies (filmed in my province!) and well-shot scenes. The music bothered me to no end, though. So, a flawed but well-made film.",Brokeback Mountain
167,Stay_away_from_the_Metropol,The ultimate portrayal of 75% of America - IDIOTS,7,2 December 2008,"First off, let me say, this is NOT a homophobic post. I felt like I needed to say that for those people who aren't the best listeners/readers and can't figure out on their own.This movie is the perfect portrayal of 75% of the people in America - IDIOTS WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO STRUCTURE OUT A HEALTHY FUTURE FOR THEMSELVES. That was one of the best things about the movie though - is how it kept hammering down on the point that IF YOU DENY WHO YOU REALLY ARE, AND DON'T DO EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT TO BE DOING WITH YOUR LIFE - THEN YOUR LIFE IS GOING TO GET MESSED UP. (aka you're gonna upset people, you're gonna be unhappy and missing something inside and it's going to show, and you'll end up alone and miserable). The movie was extremely hard to enjoy while viewing, because almost every character in the movie was an annoying, brainless hillbilly. During the first section of the movie, when they're actually up on the mountain, it had me wondering ""what the heck motivated these guys to want to do this movie?"". Not just because they aren't gay in real life and have to get all gay (like really intensely gay) up on each other, but because aside from the intense making out and BF'ing, they are just a couple of BORING LOSERS. Who wants to spend their life herding sheep on a mountain? Day and night? And especially in the 60's - possibly the most amazing decade in our history??? Get a LIFE!!! Jake Gyllenhaal's character was really gross anyways. I don't really get it. If I was gay, and was going to love someone over Michelle Williams and my 2 daughters, it'd have to be a pretty hot dude like Kevin Barnes or that Shane dude from The L Word. Anyways, the movie really picks up once they get off the mountain and get married and we start watching their lives go by at like a YEAR PER MINUTE. it's impossible to have a bad movie when you are seeing only the entertaining stuff in a couple of people's lives. There was a massive amount of foreshadowing, which made things easy to call out but none of the scenarios were ever too cliché - they were all entertaining and effective. I am still surprised it won Best Picture, but it's a very solid and very different movie. All performances were solid - Heath Ledger was great, Michelle Williams was perfect, Gylenhaal was crazy and wildly entertaining but still extremely unattractive, Quaid was believable in his role, annnnd Anne Hathaway was surprisingly awesome in her part. I still think they should have picked someone else to play Donnie Darko's part...JACK TWIST?!??!?!Congrats Ang Lee - your HULK was really bad... way to recover!",Brokeback Mountain
168,theshadow908,"Dull, boring, and amazingly overrated.",3,14 April 2006,"I wanted to watch Brokeback Mountain for one simple reason. I enjoy watching movies that have a big buzz or controversy surrounding them. This had both. I read some amazing reviews from many different critics as well. Being a straight 17 year old male, I obviously took a lot of grief from my friends when I mentioned wanting to see this movie. However, I still sat down and watched it...What a huge mistake that was. It was the longest and most torturing 134 minutes of my life. I mean don't get me wrong, I've seen far worse movies, but at least they were so bad they were good. They half way entertained me. This movie did nothing for me.What was good about Brokeback Mountain? The film making and cinematography. Ang Lee was better here than with Hulk, that's for sure. The sets and the way it was filmed were done really well. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were good in their roles. I mean, anytime an actor plays a role that's something they're not, be it gay, handicapped, a serial killer or a drug addict, they have to be a good actor to pull it off believably. They succeeded with that.What was bad? Everything else. The story, the dialogue, the way it flowed, everything. Nothing happens throughout the movie. I could sum it up with ""They meet, they fall in love, they continue to meet until the movie ends"". Really, everything else was just stretched from there. I'm trying so hard to think of how to put this like an actual critic would, but I can't. It was boring! It sucked! I couldn't wait for it to end, and when it did I was relieved.I can't believe all the amazing things that were said about this movie. I think people just gave it praise because they wanted to fit in.

169,Enrique-Sanchez-56,"Love: O Mysterious, Seductive Treachery",10,20 January 2006,"Love is mysterious. It seduces us into places where we may not have ever gone, but for a love which is mysterious, wonderful and true.Yes.I have seen Brokeback Mountain.In fact it has been nearly 6 hours since I walked out of the theater and it has taken almost everything I have to summon any words to explain how this film has taken hold of me. How it has seduced my heart and my mind.This film is universal. And perhaps it is not universal.Enough cannot be said for HEATH LEDGER or JAKE GYLLENHAAL. They practically carried an entire film with an artistry that has propelled them both into a realm of deservedly elevated recognition.The specific events of this film concern themselves with two men who fall in love. It happens to take place on a certain glorious mountain while they work as cowboys. (Or in this case, sheep herders.) Some have said that it is a ""gay cowboy movie"". Yet, it is more than that and also on the contrary it is only that. The events might be transferred to any combination of lovers who cannot reveal their truths. Yet, it concerns only the results of trying to live the ""love that dare not speak its name."" I won't try to appease either side. This film will envelope you just the same no matter your vantage point.Anyway you view this film, the end result is that love which does not follow the path set by supposedly mainstream traditions is sometimes destined to implode from its rejection by society. That is to say that the love itself is not destroyed by the lovers but by the pressure which is exerted against those lovers. It destroys the lovers from the outside inwardly.Yet, in some miraculous instances, the love survives. That society has changed its attitudes some but, just a little in the ensuing historical 40 years since the storyline of this film begins is only a side issue. And yet, an important factor.The world changes slowly. Descendents of the confederacy still cling to what happened 141 years ago, Jews cling to what happened 60 plus years ago, Cubans cling to what happened to 47 years ago and Vietnam veterans will cling for at least the period of their lifetimes.Love like war is, to borrow a song title, a battlefield of beliefs, fears and unrealized hopes. But it is more than that. It is something that we cannot predict, or plan or contemplate until it hits us.We never know from where it is about to emerge and we never know where it is about to transport us.Jack and Ennis encountered this kind of dilemma. But they could not share it with the world and had trouble enough sharing it with themselves.What ANG LEE has done is to make an epic love story into an intimate tale. Sounds simple enough until one realizes that the epic nature of the film is within the hearts and minds of the two men. This expansion of the Annie Proulx short story by McMurty and Ossana brings us inside of the men's minds without necessary writing down every word for them to say. They rely on that almost extinct sense of art called ""subtlety"" to convey this. Another feat, not so small.That class of sensibility begins and ends the film. When Ennis has an uncontrollable torrent of feelings bursting out of him at the end and could have possibly said a multitude of banal statements, he only blurts out three words. These three words will stay with me for a very long time.Not only is there credit to the writers for the eloquent simplicity of that ending, due credit must deservedly go to the speaker, HEATH LEDGER. These are the three words that burst my floodgates and left me immobile, physically and emotionally overwrought until this moment. The words were not vulgar, nor offensive, sentimental or cliché. They were art.The answer to how many films have been able to do all of this in the past, is enough to explain how this movie has reached its worldwide acclaim. It is a distinction for its directors, writers, actors, composer and crews to have worked and brought us this timeless, timely tale of love.Recommended Without Reservation.",Brokeback Mountain
170,Mike_Devine,Will be remembered for its impact in cinematic history,6,9 May 2021,"At the core of Ang Lee's 'Brokeback Mountain' is a portrait of a love story that at the time could not have been, but still managed to be. While it's a reflection of a time and place that feels very far away from present day, the film still goes against the grain of what is considered mainstream, even 15+ years after its release.What 'Brokeback' has going for it is a picturesque setting of the American west and the story of a unique relationship between two cowboys who must conform to societal norms. The way things unfold over the course of decades, with Jake Gyllenhaal's Jack and the late Heath Ledger's Ennis, makes for an interesting storyline, as these two characters experience similar yet different tracks that test the strength of their bond. One can argue that Ledger out-acts Gyllenhaal, as he fits the role much more authentically, although you can barely make out a word he says through his chronic mumbling.Yes, it's a sad story that is hard to watch and is pretty boring at times, but 'Brokeback Mountain' will always be remembered for its place in history and impact on American culture.",Brokeback Mountain
171,nobbytatoes,a rare gem,10,11 February 2006,"In 1963, two strangers, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist are looking for work. Both find work herding sheep for Joe Aguirre on Brokeback Mountain. Both men are completely different from each other, Ennis is extremely introverted and emotionally isolated, not connecting to others through his mumbled words. Jack is open and self confident, with inspirations of glory on the rodeo scene. Over the days stuck in the isolated mountain range, their friendship makes a strong connection between them, soon becoming a highly intimate and emotionally charged relationship. When the season is over, returning to humanity, they both go their separate ways. Ennis marries his fiancé Alma and have two girls, while Jack tries the rodeo with little success, though soon meets Lureen both marrying with a baby boy soon to follow.Brokeback Mountain is one of those exceptional films that come ever so rarely, that instantly marks itself in history. The emotional manipulation is wielded so strong that its hard not to be swept up in the emotionally charged relationship of Ennis and Jack. While Ennis is happiest with Jack, he understands the ramification of public scrutiny, which Jack fails to understand, not wanting a hidden life. Taking the brunt end are Jack and Ennis's wives, stuck in their empty, impassioned marriages, constantly questioning themselves and the nature of Jack and Ennis's friendship.The subtlety of Ang Lee's direction reveals the beauty of Brokeback Mountain. Lee superbly connects the dilemmas of the characters and the landscapes they wonder. The breath taking, sweeping, remote landscape of the Wyoming Mountains, brilliantly captured by cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, are so lush and alluring that your uncontrollably drawn in. Brokeback Mountain could not have been placed in the hands of another director, Lee never being didactic while shooting you right into the heart of the film. While set in the open plains of the mountain, the story is so emotionally suffocating. The claustrophobia is tautly constructed by Ang Lee, tightly grabbing you and never letting go.The truth and honesty is the real distinguishing facet of Brokeback Mountain. Never does the story feel artificial or unrealistic. The themes are so universal of love stories, perfectly depicting unrequested love; where everything doesn't work out and doesn't end happy. Enahncing this is the somber, mellow acoustic guitar, constantly encapsulating the heart break and angst between Ennis and Jack.Nothing short of exceptional can describe Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal performances. Never have both actors been so revelatory in their career so far. Heath Ledger perfectly embodies the introversion and depth of Ennis. Ledger wonderfully shows the change of Ennis over the twenty year period the film takes. Jake Gyllenhaal does an equally brilliant performance, vividly bringing the angst and heartbreak to Jack. While it is the male actors that are center stage, Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway are both sorely overlooked. Michelle Williams is outstanding, with her shining above Ledger and Gyllenhaal. Williams is so dramatically charged, giving her career defining performance. While she has a minor role, Anne Hathaway is great as Lureen, finishing the perfect touch of brilliant casting.Deserving of all the accolades it's given, Brokeback Moutain is a heart breaking love story like no other. It's simple perfect in every way.",Brokeback Mountain
172,Rockwell_Cronenberg,"Six years later, it hits even harder.",9,28 October 2011,"I've always admired this film to a certain extent, but I think the thing that always kept me from loving it was that it never resonated with me emotionally. I would get attached while watching it, but all of those feelings would leave me fairly soon afterward. It had been about five years since I'd seen the film, and in that time I have grown up a lot, fallen in love, had my heart ripped to shreds and fallen back in love again and I think this growth personally has really opened me up to a place in my mind and heart to embrace this film more than most other screen romances that exist. Almost immediately it hit me harder than it had before and after a day since I watched it, the pain and heartache I experienced during it still remains at my core.It's a love film told non-traditionally, but not because it's two men, that doesn't even factor into the depiction of it. It's nontraditional because it's two people fighting against the love and it's accuracy in this is startling. How there are times where you can hate the person you love, hate so many things about them and hate that you are in love with them, but you can't give it up at all. You can't walk away from it because it's like an addiction and I think this film more than any before it captures that remarkably.A lot of this lies in the writing, but of course the performances from Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal certainly play a key factor in capturing it. Their characters take the love in different forms, Ennis fighting himself over it and Jack fighting the world because of it, but both actors capture exactly what they need to and bring this magnetism that really sparks. Gyllenhaal's openness is beautiful, his determination to make the love work and to just exist the way he wants to, he definitely provides the emotional anchor for the film and gives a heartbreaking portrayal.It's Ledger, of course, who steals the show though, with a kind of transcendent performance that we're treated to maybe once a decade. He becomes this character in such a vivid way that you don't even recognize the actor inside the role anymore. Gyllenhaal is Jack and hits the surface notes expertly, but you can still see Jake Gyllenhaal in there. Heath Ledger is completely gone and from the very beginning of the film we have Ennis and we have him until the very end. This character is an incredibly difficult one to take on, he could have easily been someone who was hard to like or sympathize with due to his internalizing and his refusal to fully embrace the relationship and who he is, but that's what makes it hit even harder, thanks to Ledger's brutal work.You see the pain in this person living a lie in every moment we have with him, with that turned in mouth and speech pattern that always sounds like it's hurting him to let anything out because he's afraid of how people are going to react. It's a performance unlike any other out there and in the end it's one that brings me to my knees. ""Jack, I swear,"" was always a line that floored me when I was watching it but now it's at a point where just thinking of the line and the way that Ledger delivers it brings some water to my eyes.",Brokeback Mountain

Although set in another time and place it shows us how far we have to go as a people to find something other than bigotry and hatred in this great land of equality of ours.This film hurt to watch. It hurt to see the love between Ennis and Jack. It hurt to know that they could not openly be together. It hurt to see the unfortunate end of that relationship. And most of all it hurt to realize the loneliness of Ennis in the end. This film should have swept the Oscars in its year, but the ever fickle and conservative Hollywood powers that be again acted out of their need to appear manly, godly, the usual form of Hollywood hypocrisy. No one who has seen this film, and has any humanity in them, has been left unaffected. It says so much in just what it doesn't say. The performances of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are sublime, showing that they are both actors capable of going outside the envelope in the roles that they will take, and giving their all for the parts. The rest of the cast was all right, but the power and the emotion of the work rests squarely with these two fine actors.

174,jayjaycee,"More than just ""that gay cowboy film""",9,10 June 2020,"""Brokeback Mountain"" is a 2005 drama directed by Ang Lee starring Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. For my second extracurricular contribution to the ""Queering Cinema"" community project, I decided to tackle one of the most critically acclaimed dramas from the oughts of this century. Allegedly, the director who has previously been known to me as the director of the visually stunning drama ""Life of Pi"" but also the disastrous comic book adaptation ""Hulk"" has created his opus magnum with this motion picture, hence my expectations to it remained neutral, even if I was a little euphoric as well, because of the phenomenal actors and actresses that star in it. Even if a star-studded doesn't automatically guarantee a fine film (history has proven it multiple times), I was sure to experience some excellence. Aside from Gyllenhaal, who famously happens to be my favourite actor, there is the legendary Heath Ledger starring opposite him, as well as a young Michelle Williams, who happens to be my favourite actress, and even Anne Hathaway in a smaller role. Regarding acting talent, this film is redundant with people who are capable of writing cinematic history. As it turns out, this is exactly what they did. Lee created a remarkable and multifarious drama that hits deep with everything it has to offer. Beforehand, I thought that the runtime of a little more than two hours could be too long, but ultimately turns out to be the appropriate amount of time to unfold the tragic romance between two shepherds. The film starts out rather slowly and takes a lot of time to introduce the leading characters, but at the same time feels oddly rushed. Most of the scenes in the beginning have zero to no dialogue and live from the visually stunning aesthetics of the mountains, storms and sheep flock and the relationship between Ennis and Jack develops in an extremely subliminal way. Avowedly, that both all suddenly have sex after in fact not much has happened between them appeared strange to me at first but makes a lot of sense retrospectively. As previously mentioned, the tension is built up subtly and isn't palpable straight away and hides in seemingly insignificant details. Also, it was all done intentionally to present the audience with a fait accompli, for they are confused about the whole situation themselves. Confusion is a pivotal theme in this film and influences the whole narration. Many things deliberately remain uncertain and the audience is left in the dark with most matters and must join the dots themselves. The by far biggest and most interesting mystery is what it is what they share. If I remember it correctly, the words ""gay"" and ""homosexual"" or other variants are not mentioned once, and it is left up to the audience to evaluate the relationship of the two protagonists. Are they homosexual, are they bisexual or was all just an illusion that resulted from isolation of being in the mountains? Whatever they have experienced remains unclear, as they both still seem to be attracted to their wives and also other girls, but fact is that those two human beings fell in love with each other despite their inability to express their true intentions and feelings. That's what makes this story so terribly tragic. The whole narration covers a time span of more than twenty years and the way they try to secretly relive their special romance they had in the early sixties. While the film was little fast paced in the beginning and could have taken a little more time to invest in depicting the heartache they feel when they are apart, it is still enough to make it appear so extremely unpleasant. It is nothing short of painful to see how those two men who share a deep bond must conceal their feelings, as homosexuality was not only frowned upon but also a matter that would have deprived them from any social status. Therefore, they continue living their lives without letting their true desire get in their ways, the only opportunity to meet each other is by one-night stands disguised as fishing and hunting trips. They even discuss their ideas of how it would be possible to settle down together, they have concrete plans of how to accomplish it, but ultimately Ennis fears the reaction of the society they live in. As if that hasn't been already heartbreaking enough, Lee ups the ante and makes it even more unbearable in the final act. After Jack all suddenly dies under strange circumstances, if he really died in a car accident or was killed by a group of homophobes, as Ennis imagines it, is not in fact mentioned, the film reached its emotional climax. Whatever has happened to him, fact is he is dead. How Ennis tries to cope with it in the final twenty minutes must be one of the most devastating sequences in history of drama. What makes it so utterly terrible is that they had so many chances, so many opportunities that could have prevented this tragic fate, but in the end, they never dared to seize them. All of this already sounds tremendously saddening, but it is the actors that breathe life into tragedy. Aside from a magnificent supporting role by my acting heroine Williams who masters the character of the fragile and subtly depressed wife wonderfully (another reason for me to love her), the chemistry between Ledger and Gyllenhaal is terrifically genuine and they play their respective roles convincingly. Also, their characters are both wonderfully developed and make this whole romance appear so realistic. Gyllenhaal is the more determined one, while Ledger portrays the more hesitant lover. Fact is, both manage to make it appear as if they are in love with each other in their own irresolute way and you can literally feel the way they express their desire for one another. While Ennis is taciturn throughout and leaves the talking up to Jack, it is the total opposite in the third act. They both have delivered already touching performances by then, but I swear to God, this final scene where Ennis stands in front of the wardrobe and looks at that blood-smeared shirt his beloved has kept over the years and realizes that he should have done so many things differently and breaks out in tears, is one of the most heartbreaking and devastating scenes I have ever seen. Seriously, I sobbed due to this emotional intensity. That his daughter told him that she is gonna get married with someone she barely knows but deeply loves no matter what reminds him of the chances he didn't seize. In this final shot it is all coming together, fear, regret and desire, and the combination of all those haunting feelings even makes the principally barely emotional Ennis Del Mar weep bitterly - and this is masterful acting and story telling. All in all, this star-studded drama is a highly emotional and hauntingly tragic ride into the deepest depths of human desire. It explores the strange love of two men who can not really tell how they feel about each other in an extremely sensitive way and comes to life by the outstanding performances of the lead actors who guide the viewer through this ambiguous and heartbreaking story. This film is without a doubt one of the best dramas of the decades and despite some pacing issues in the beginning, manages to be a breathtakingly tragic tale that sticks with the audience for a while. This film ends exactly as the two protagonists promise it to each other: What happens in Brokeback Mountain, stays in Brokeback Mountain. It is the devastating but unalterable truth behind it all. A gut-wrenching classic and extremely important entry in the landscape of LGBTQ films.",Brokeback Mountain

176,jackasstrange,One of the very best of 2005,8,11 November 2013,"Brokeback Mountain has a very original and well-made story. Two Cowboys being lovers during 20 years is really original. Although the same formula of the script of this film could've used to depict a straight couple. I mean, the story don't fit exclusively and only in a 'gay' universe. It's not something that would happen exclusively to homosexuals. And if we think well, there is no conflict, or at least a decent one, which treats of their homosexuality in relation to the other people, what is in fact, very surprising. Generally, 'gay themed' films tend to explore the relation of the gays being often in conflict with the society. But OK, that was the film intention anyways, so i just can cheer the production of the film for a nearly flawless romance film. Because technically it's a great film. Wonderful shots of the 'Brokeback Mountain', which looks dread and full of life at the same time. Is just weird, but beautiful...in a way. The soundtrack is not bad either, but i disliked some of the cheesy 'love' songs which started to play every time when the situation becomes way too melodramatic. That ruined the film a little for me. I found them to be way too annoying.And very inspired performances by all the leads. Heath Ledger is,once again, fantastic. This was arguably his second best acting performance in the career, just behind the obvious first place... So yeah, Brokeback Mountain is a beautiful film and deserves a watch. 7.7/10",Brokeback Mountain
177,jldmp1,Bodacious Cowboys,7,15 April 2006,"A fine example of compositional film-making. Ang sets this up from the get-go by framing the world of shepherding with the titular mountain as the background, a 'current' of activity in the middle, i.e., the sheep or the river current itself, and the passionate bits right up close in the foreground.This is mirrored in the story composition; the central relationship depends on those infrequent 'high altitude' trysts appearing way up close and tightly framed; the lives of married men and their families carry the middle current; the spectral backdrop is 'homophobia' (if such a charitably restrained word can be used to describe the disgusting inhumanity displayed in the Matthew Shepard murder, to which this plainly alludes -- it looms at least as large as the mountain).Kudos to Ang for getting the stance right -- no treatises on the minutiae of a cowboy's existence. And he got the musical accompaniment right...repeatedly iterating that minor-key waltz to punctuate the visual narrative and then move us forward.",Brokeback Mountain
178,B24,Finally Arrives at the HBO-Bravo State,10,28 June 2008,"OK, this is a little late in the game, and no one is likely to read it anyway, but history requires the perspective of age in order to elude snap responses that usually get it wrong.The movie and the story on which it is based are both fine pieces of creative work. I am familiar with both. Moreover, I lived in Wyoming sheep country for several years in the early 1960's myself. I knew lots of the folks characterized in this film, from preposterous uptight rednecks to gay sheepherders to cowgirl floozies. Annie Proulx got it all right. So much for that.Now that millions of people who don't go to the cinema and don't buy books or CD's are seeing the movie for the first time on cable, it seems appropriate to add a word or two to the thousands already written here. Even if you don't read through all the comments as an aid to understanding all the different points of view BB has opened up since it came to the screen in 2005 -- and you're seeing it now for the first time -- there is still time and need for you to offer your own fresh insights.Mine are as follows: (1) the visuals and the score cannot be faulted; (2) the text is open to question -- read the original story and you'll see why; (3) direction and editing are generally quite good; (4) acting tends to melodrama, which in turn accents the one flaw in an otherwise compelling story -- sentimentality that obscures basic character development.On the last point, sentiment itself is not a bad thing. It is the emotional basis of love. But one's need for love in one form or another is complex as to its origins. To set out to touch someone's heart is a task requiring more than inducing people to laugh or cry; it requires intellect as well. In other words, you don't need to like the characters or what they do in a film in order to appreciate them as fellow human beings. The film version of this story pulls too many punches in order to soften the image of the two main characters. It's just too easy to cry at the end and forget that both of these guys made some really bad choices as a result of a lack of honesty to their true natures and personal courage.The short story provides a basis for better interpreting the film.It also undercuts gratuitous and often subliminal gay-bashing that characterizes the usual suspects who rate this film merely on the basis of offended tastes.",Brokeback Mountain
179,come2whereimfrom,a real love story,8,28 April 2006,"Hot on the heels of a shed load of awards, Brokeback is a for-runner for Oscar glory. Set in the mountains of America it is a love story of sorts between two ranch hands that lasts over twenty years. Told with affection by director Ang Lee it is for one of a better phrase a modern day Romeo and Juliet. Forbidden love in a climate of intolerance. Firstly this film looks amazing the cinematography is superb, it has a great soundtrack and brilliant performances from the two leads. All that said the script is well adapted from the short story from which it was taken but there is a sense that it may be a little too long, the original was only twenty pages and captured the same emotion within that time as this film does in two and a half hours. Its not that there is really ever a bad moment just a few too many good ones. I don't dislike the film, I rather enjoyed it but I don't think it's as good as the hype, where as I could watch the directors other films like 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' over and over I'm not sure I'd ever feel the need to watch this one again. That said it is worth watching once for all the things that are right with it and I suspect it will clean up at the Oscars. If you want to watch a good film then see this movie.

180,flicklover,"A good film, but don't believe the hype!!!!",7,10 January 2006,"This film is getting a lot of attention for obvious reasons, the film has been adopted by people with agendas that have nothing to do with the film itself. It is of course about 2 cowboys that fall in love and have a secret homosexual relationship over a 20 year period. I went into this film wanting to see if it was as good as all the reviews are saying. Needless to say it is a good film, Heath Ledger gives a great performance, Jake Gyllenhaal is good but doesn't match the intensity of Ledger. They meet on a job during a summer,where they are alone, and have a sudden strong attraction towards each other. The movie is not really concerned with the physical part of the relationship. Director Ang lee should be credited with not dwelling on the obvious sexual encounters of the men. The movie believe it or not has a very tradition Hollywood structure, 2 lovers meet, realize they can't be together, and decide to have a a secret love affair. The fact that it is between 2 men is the reason that the film is garnering such attention. If the film's love story was between a man and a woman, the film would not be as highly regarded as it is. It bothers me because I think that as a film it is done with such care for its story. I do feel that the film does not focus on the wives of these 2 men enough. The truth is these 2 men are lying to the 2 people that love them, the movie really doesn't deal satisfactorally with that. The film will not change anyone's mind about the subject of homosexuality, I believe it is a compelling story. What I don't agree with is that it is being touted as a masterpiece simply because of the fact that the lovers are 2 men. The move is good on it's own merits, but it is really not what it is being made out to be. To call this the greatest love story ever as I have read I think is disengenious, it is a compelling human story, but it bothers me that this movie is being treated as if it were a masterpiece for political reasons.",Brokeback Mountain

182,refresh_daemon,Good,8,1 February 2007,"I'm sure we've all heard enough about the ""gay cowboy"" movie, but I decided to go check the film out with a friend one Saturday afternoon. Ang Lee's previous works that I've seen (i.e. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, The Ice Storm and Eat Drink Man Woman) haven't disappointed me in the past, so I figured this one would be good too.For the most part, I feel that it was. The pace and the directing was pretty typical for Ang Lee, which means a little slow (not necessarily a bad thing) and very controlled and subtle. The performances were very good, with Heath Ledger at a level you never would have expected from his filmography and Michelle Williams having one of the most difficult scenes to watch. These was a bit of sex on screen (both homosexual and heterosexual), but nothing outside of what we're used to from the industry. If this makes you uncomfortable or is otherwise unhealthy for you to see, I would recommend avoiding this one.The story was a bit limited, but the source materials isn't too deep, so it's unsurprising. I think viewing the film as a love story isn't the best way to see it and I think there would've been a bit more to gain by focusing more on Heath Ledger's character and reducing the screen time spent on Jake Gyllenhaal's character. If that happened, then the film might've been a very potent exploration of the character's self-discovery and growth, but as it is, focusing on the relationship between the two errant cowboys as much as it did took a bit of air out of beneath of the wings of the story's dramatic focus in Heath Ledger's character.Still, it was a good enough work for what it was, well directed, with solid performances. It could've been more, but it settled for just good in my eyes. It certainly won't deter my interest in watching future films from Mr. Lee. 8/10.",Brokeback Mountain

My headline, is in reference to the film itself, not the subject matter. It was a disappointing, slow, and sometimes boring film.The performances were outstanding, and the ones that really shined through were that of; Heath Ledger, Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway. Jake Gyllanhaal's performance was somewhat good, but it may have been his character I didn't care for, or he just didn't give it his all like I'd expected him to.If you don't know the plot already, you're in for a bit of a surprise. The two characters played by Ledger and Gyllanhaal, are bi-sexual, and although they lead happy normal lives with their wives and children, two or three times a year, the two men meet on Brokeback Mountain to share their secret love for one another, through reminiscing and sexuality.To be honest there were only two things I enjoyed about the film. The acting, and the cinematography. The acting was very realistic and at times brilliant, while the cinematography was phenomenal. Breathtaking and stunning, throughout the entire film. Everything else was a great disappointment. The story was even hardly worth a nomination let alone winning best screenplay. And, might I mention that although there are plenty of films out there that represent heterosexual adultery (which I don't advocate either), no one seems to acknowledge the fact that what these two men in the movie are doing, is extraordinarily selfish, and hurtful to their families. It was a strange film, and unanswered in a lot of ways.I wouldn't recommend it. I think it's just another drop of sadness to add to our declining culture. What a shame.",Brokeback Mountain

It almost makes me sad that 'Crash' won Best picture and not Brokeback, but then again, I would have felt the same way if the positions were reversed..And a special mention goes to the score and songs; I will never hear 'The Wings' or 'He Was A Friend Of Mine' the same way again.A masterpiece. 9/10.",Brokeback Mountain

The film won every major Best Picture award across three continents, yet I said to myself there is no way this film is that good.In the light of other heavyweights of that year, such as Spielberg's intense Munich, and Paul Haggis' uncompromising Crash (which actually won the Best Picture Oscar), I thought Brokeback Mountain was probably overrated. I could not have been more wrong and more ignorant; not having a chance to catch the film and perhaps not pursuing it due to its nature and theme, it has finally been more than three years when I decided to sit through and watch Ang Lee's unusual western if you like.Undoubtedly on of the best films of 2005, Brokeback Mountain is a daring and immensely powerful film with a simple statement: Love Is A Force of Nature (and who are we to judge how it takes form for some people).A lot of jokes have been made about this film, regarding the homosexual relationship between two grown men in 1960s Wyoming. All I can say is for those people who have not seen it, to go forth and witness a tragic love story, which is as sad as what we see in James Cameron's Titanic between Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio.A rancher, Ennis del Mar, (played astonishingly by the late Heath Ledger) and a rodeo cowboy, Jack Twist (another impressive performance by Jake Gylleenhaal) develop their relationship while alone in the isolated landscapes of Brokeback Mountain while attending a job of looking after hundreds of sheep. During the long cold nights, the two men finally form a sexual attraction between them; I suspect this is the first time they have been allowed to express themselves freely, in a time and a place much more hostile to homosexuality than some of our modern societies today.The story develops, as Ennis and Jack get married and have children - a sign that they are healthy, strong men, fit for America to accept them. However, the passion and the love between the two does not die out and their relationship takes on a dangerous path, sometimes destructive and ultimately tragic for both...Brokeback Mountain is an important film. It daringly shows a common humanity, it shows us that some people are simply happier with a same sex partner; now I won't sit here having moral and religious arguments.Ang Lee's film is a masterpiece. Praise must go to the superb cast, the amazing composition by Gustavo Santaolalla, the screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana and the cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto. An accomplished achievement.9/10",Brokeback Mountain

I'm pro-choice and pro-gay rights. I see no reason why homosexuals should not be allowed to wed and enjoy the same privileges married couples do. The whole protect-the-sanctity-of-marriage argument from the right comes from sanctimonious politicians who have no qualms about keeping mistresses.That having been said, on to ""Brokeback Mountain."" This is a good film. But it's also rather flawed and, frankly, undeserving of a Best Picture Oscar nomination. Of course, with all the accolades being tossed on it, instead of better, more compelling films, it appears Ang Lee's film will walk away with the top Oscar prize next month.""Brokeback Mountain"" doesn't get cooking until Michelle Williams shows up as Ennis' (Heath Ledger) wife, Alma. However, this doesn't happen for about an hour into the story and that's just one of the film's myriad problems.Screenwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana - and director Lee - take about an hour to set up what they easily could have accomplished in, say, 20 to 30 minutes, if that. Lee spends so much time trying to introduce us to Ennis and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal), but neither he nor the writers do anything substantial with that time. We're treated to gorgeous views of vistas, shepherding - yes, these cowboys herd sheep - and shots of Ennis and Jack spending the hours together in the hills, seemingly bored.Trouble is, there's nothing compelling about these scenes or the characters in these initial moments. And despite all this time together, there's never any sense of Jack feeling any closeness to Ennis. They chat - OK, Jack chats, Ennis mumbles. Often unintelligibly. (If you thought Marlon Brando mumbled his dialogue, wait 'til you get a load of Ledger.) At some point we had to feel a sense that these two connected, that there's deep feeling for one another. That never happens. Come the seduction, it's more lust appeal than any sense of budding love. By the time Jack utters the film's famous line, ""I wish I knew how to quit you"" - you just know this one's going to be spoofed soon - you have to wonder if he really means it. Because the characters, especially Jack, never express any sense of genuine love. These guys just have the hots for each other. It's as if the writers and Lee wanted to make a social commentary, but didn't have the guts to show us anything.The film's most interesting and exciting characters are the two women - Alma and Lureen (Anne Hathaway). Williams takes a lousily written role - you get the impression the writers simply wrote, ""She mopes,"" ""She mopes again,"" ""She mopes yet again"" - and turns it into something special. Williams makes Alma a thoroughly convincing person, a deeply complex woman grappling with alien issues she can't quite comprehend or know how to handle, a woman with an incredibly personal moral crisis. She truly deserves her Oscar nomination.Hathaway, like Williams, gets saddled with an underwritten role. After a topless romp, the writers relegate her to a role that's not even marginal; though they do sport her with some creative hairstyles. Hathaway does her best, but she's not quite of Williams' calibre, yet, and even a stronger actress would've struggled with this lackluster role. Lureen could've been a fascinating woman and provided the plot with exciting possibilities. But that was not to be.The lead performances are palatable, but Ledger and Gyllenhaal remain so aloof, it's downright impossible to be drawn into their love affair. This film also needed tighter editing. There's an utterly superfluous flashback toward the end that does nothing for the story.Criticizing this movie shouldn't make you a pariah. That's just political correctness run amok. The filmmakers clearly wanted to make a socially relevant film. And this is as much about societal prejudices as it is a love story about two men. But the writers never delve into anything in any real way. They begin with a stupefyingly dull first hour and skirt the message and love story.There've been many other much better, more moving gay-themed films that never got any attention. The wonderful Australian film, ""The Sum of Us"" (1994), starring Russell Crowe and Jack Thompson, springs to mind. There's more humor, genuine emotion and love in 10 minutes of that film than in all 134 minutes of the over-hyped ""Brokeback Mountain.""Subject matter alone should not automatically make a film good. Which seems to be the case here. Had this been about a man and a woman, viewers would see how humdrum it is.Interestingly, I saw this comment in Rolling Stone from Heath Ledger about the first time he saw the film: ""I understood that it flowed, it was presented well. But whether it was good, whether it was bad - we walked out not knowing what we'd just watched.""What's ultimately infuriating about ""Brokeback Mountain"" is that this story deserved to be told, only more compellingly and movingly. ""Millions,"" ""A History of Violence,"" ""Match Point"" or ""Junebug,"" deserved Best Picture Oscar nods before this one did.

This is true of all art forms of course, but the good ones drop clues along the way to point you in the right direction, but the great ones leave you struggling with paradox. My wife saw a tragic romance between two guys who could never admit their love openly. I saw two losers stuck in a dilemma without the wits to resolve it.The plot is too well known for much to be revealed as a spoiler. Two cowboys spend a summer alone together, high in the mountains of Wyoming, and have an affair. Then they spend the rest of the movie not knowing what to do with their feelings for each other. They come together much like the sheep they herd, roughly and lustfully, and they part with no stated intention to see each other again. One (Ledger) marries and becomes a father and seems determined to live out the life appointed to him. The other (Gyllenhall) drifts around the Rodeo circuit, secretly gay, but stranded in a land where such proclivities can get you beaten up or killed.When they hook up again 4 years later they fall upon each other with such abandon and indiscretion that Ledger's wife sees her husband engaged in unbridled passion not even a stone's throw from their home. This is where I lost the guys for the better part of the movie. Having a gay fling one summer is one thing, committing adultery without the blink of an eye, is another. Now I was left feeling more sympathy for Ledger's wife and children than I did for the lustful duo, the more so because I never saw much love between them. Plenty of lust and good old boy friendship, but little love. Committing adultery for lust put Ledger's character on shaky moral grounds, so I wanted to see it done for love. This is where projection comes in. My wife saw a love affair and what I saw was two guys putting their libidos ahead of their responsibilities. When Ledger goes on to neglect his doting daughter I cared even less about his dilemma.It's obvious that the story is not destined for a happy ending. It is, after all a cautionary tale about forbidden love in the land of a ""man's got to do what a man's got to do!"" But in the end thanks to the screenwriters finally getting Gyllenhall to open up about his intrinsic gayness, we also get to see Ledger's character realize that infidelity rips out the heart.Ledger will be nominated for an Oscar, and if Straithairn doesn't win it, then he should. His portrayal of a man strangling on his own pent up emotions is the centerpiece of the movie.",Brokeback Mountain
190,Jay_Exiomo,An emotionally powerful film,9,15 February 2006,"Based on a short story by Annie Proulx, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a melancholic tale of two cowboys caught up in the arms of a forbidden love. Helmed by Ang Lee, it looms as the favorite to win the Academy for Best Picture and Best Director Awards.Also nominated for Best Actor is Heath Ledger, who plays Ennis Del Mar, a cowboy who finds work as a shepherd one summer up in the grandeur of Brokeback Mountain. Working with him is another cowboy and a would-be rodeo competitor Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and their relationship grows into something more, and henceforth the film covers the fragility and superficial happiness of the two as they go on with their marriages, divorces, and dealing with their families. Twice a year they go back to Brokeback Mountain to rekindle what was once their paradise, excusing themselves from the rest of society as going to a fishing trip.This is a very provocative and, in some ways, powerful film that eventually stays on not only for its unconventional premise but for the way Lee superbly handles it. His reflective style obviously works for films like this. Gustavo Santaolalla gives an evocative score, composed mainly of singular guitar strums, that underlines the lush dramatic qualities of the film.Still, the strength of the film mainly rests on its well-written characters, and Ledger and Gyllenhaal deliver brave performances while ably supporting them are a cast of actors that includes Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway as the cowboys' wives.I liked ""Brokeback Mountain"" and appreciated it as a study of the emotions of the two main characters as they go on with the aspects of their feelings for each other. It's about reality told with much sophistication.",Brokeback Mountain
191,fimimix,A Tragedy of Life,10,30 April 2006,"I've read only one comment; while I agree with it, please read some of the other comments which give you details of the plot. If you haven't loved strongly, without knowing you do only to discover it is part-and-parcel of your life, it is impossible to get the true meaning of this film.The comment I read predicted a ""take-off"" for Ledger's (del Mar) career: I wonder! Although ""Brokeback Mountain"" is primarily about HIS aimless drifting through life and his performance breathed reality into that morass, I'd never heard of him; that he would be black-balled for his accepting this role would be a tragedy. However, Hollywood isn't nearly as liberal as most people think. Jake G. (Jack) has made several films; only ""Day after Tomorrow"" (so far) is nearly as good as his role in this film. ""Jarhead"" - while the acting is good, he certainly doesn't have any compulsions about appearing naked!, unlike the sweet character in ""Day"" - is a waste, except to vividly depict how the USA turns very young men into ""macho"" robots for killing. Society idolizes these men, then treats any homosexual tendency in them - or in a civilian life - as sinful.Yes, the old testament of The Bible condemns it; one can only feel that Jesus felt differently. This film is a perfect example of how hot-blooded males find love for another male, when they are isolated in an idyllic setting - or any ole place, if the chemistry is right. The recent scandal of soldiers in Iraq appearing on web-sites for prostitution is a wake-up call. ""Brokeback"" depicts a true-to-life story of self-condemnation and fear of discovery, while living miserably in secrecy, on ""del Mar's"" part. ""Alma"" discovered where her husband's true love lay when she witnessed the two men kissing in the alley. The fact ""del Mar"" never brought home a ""catch"" after an impassioned dash to the mountain to meet ""Jack"", her rage during the ""outing""-scene clearly depicted HER misery all through a failed marriage. ""Once I had an idea"" and ""every six months!"", as ""Jack"" tells ""del Mar"", are the revelations there is no other love for him. The scent of a shirt during ""del Mar's"" visit to ""Jack's"" parents brings it home clearly to ""del Mar"" he has made his own misery. Whether we recognize it or not, we ALL know men who love one another. Today, it is more openly accepted, but is still a scandal in many parts of our ""enlightened"" society.This film was robbed of its deserved academy awards. It will be difficult to produce another film with its clarion announcement: we have no right to judge others, and that love will be love no matter whom it finds. It also shows that we cannot be tolerant toward those who are different than ourselves, and how difficult it is to be compassionate toward other humans we don't understand. ""Brokeback Mountain"" was superbly acted by every member of its cast. Mr. Ang directed a masterpiece, with the help of wonderful cinematography and a brilliant script. There are many films on this subject, but none so easily understood and openly presented as ""Brokeback Mountain"". Bravo!",Brokeback Mountain
192,Bob Pr.,"Fascinating ""Forbidden/Unattainable Love"" story",10,25 January 2006,"I read the story shortly after seeing the movie. (It's in the Oct. 13, 1997, issue of ""The New Yorker"" which most libraries will have; BTW, that same issue has a fascinating article on Truman Capote.) Reading the story (for me) added to my appreciation of the film. The film was remarkably faithful to the short story. I voted it an ""8"" shortly after seeing it but changed it to a ""10"" for its remarkable capturing of painful human dilemmas.My view of BBM is shaped by my 35 years as a psychotherapist working with many people, straight and gay (closeted and out), families, etc.Most people see BBM as a tragic love story in which Jack and Ennis could have lived happily ever after if only Ennis had been able to let himself do that.But my experience is that almost always, to be capable of loving -- of giving and accepting being loved -- a person needs to experience lots of that as a child with one, and usually both parents (or parent surrogates). Ennis didn't have that and if Jack got even a little of it, it sure wasn't from both parents. So both of them grew up yearning for something either they never received or got far too little of. And when that happens, the less common result is to to seal off emotions (as Ennis usually did to blunt the pain) or, far more frequently, to be like the sad clown who keeps reaching to the floor to grab something he wants very much but whose foot always kicks it away just before it's grasped. IMO, Ennis could function with his wife, Alma, mainly when they played out conventional 1920s-50s gender stereotypes or roles. (Men on top, women submit, mothers (not fathers) feed their children, etc.)But love with Jack? -- Ennis could express lust and some resemblance of love only as long as the barriers remained (barriers of distance and time in between his meetings with Jack). And he could become most fully aware of his yearning for Jack only after Jack's death -- death, the ultimate, permanent barrier. So I saw it as a story about a common human tragedy that many people experience -- males and females, regardless of sexual orientation. Because when, as a child, we don't get something extremely important to us (e.g., love,affection, feeling of self-worth, etc.), while we often spend the rest of our lives pursuing it, we also find myriad ways of defeating ourselves -- e.g., by choosing the wrong partners, by ill-chosen reactions or decisions to drive away any partner who could be right, etc, etc., etc..IF Ennis HAD been able to let himself go live with Jack, their relation (IMO) could not have lasted, in part because neither would any longer have the stereotypical gender roles to guide them, in part because of Ennis's inability to talk things out, his blocking of empathy, but most of all because of the ""danger"" both would feel in ever actually getting a forbidden goal. Their relationship could last as long as it did because it was a forbidden fruit that the two could only briefly taste between long periods of separation.Acting in BBM was absolutely superb as was the casting. Films usually delineate one character very well, maybe another fairly well, and all others only briefly. While that was true here, the Ennis character was exceptionally well brought to full life; Jack's only slightly less so. And the marvelous quality of this movie is the extent to which ALL of the other characters -- Ennis's wife, Alma, and oldest daughter; Jack's wife, Lureen, and her father; Jack's parents -- all contributed to an integrated, totally believable, totally human, totally realistic picture. And I've thought that ALWAYS a film will be less detailed than the story from which it's adapted. This is an EXCEEDINGLY RARE exception; it is far more detailed, more nuanced than the short story on which it's based while remaining absolutely true to it. Many kudos to the director, screen writers, and their human behavior consultants. The photography was also superb -- some shots looked as if they could be framed and hung in art museums.",Brokeback Mountain
193,tnrcooper,Fabulous film,10,26 March 2006,"I'm curious to see Crash having seen this film. I have a hard time believing it was better than this one. This film is masterfully adapted from an Annie Proulx short story. Ang Lee directs and once again impresses with his range. He has directed ancient Chinese epics (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), 1970s epic scale dramas (The Ice Storm), big-budget blockbusters (The Hulk), Civil War epics (Ride the Dragon), and British 18th century literary adaptations (Sense and Sensibility). The first film, which gained him the attention of Hollywood, was 1993's The Wedding Banquet. The ability he showed in making that film convinced execs that he could bring Sense and Sensibility to the screen in a winning and convincing manner. And he did not disappoint them. 13 years down the line, Lee continues to impress. The main attribute in allowing him to tell such a wide range of stories is a lesson that many lesser directors would do well to remember: it's about the story. And now this. Lee's ability to find the emotional center of all these stories explains his success in making films that have made money but have also retained their stories' essential integrity. It doesn't sound like particularly ground-breaking advice, and indeed, it isn't. However it always serves him well in telling a story that has a thesis, that has a point. Most people realize at least that Lee has a mastery of his material and that he wishes to tell stories that will connect with many. This is certainly the case with Brokeback Mountain. Lee has fantastically adapted the Annie Proulx short story, focusing on a forbidden relationship between two men (Ennis del Mar and Jack Twist-played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, respectively) over 20 years, from roughly 1961 until about 1981. The men meet and get along during a cattle drive in Wyoming, and engage in a sudden, unexpected passionate clench. They do not address the forbidden love during the remainder of the cattle drive although they continue to get along quite well. When they come down from the mountains, both try and find their ways in life, Ennis marrying a reserved local girl named Alma (the fantastic Michelle Williams) while Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal, excellent as the needier of the two men) finally marries the assertive daughter (Anne Hathaway, very good as a capable businesswoman increasingly remote from her husband) of a prominent agricultural equipment salesman. Twist meets his wife in Texas and settles there while Ennis remains in Wyoming, working intermittently as he is able. However, he and his wife live an austere life. They have two girls and although he is a good father, the family's financial insecurity increases the stress between the parents. It is several years after Ennis and Jack's original encounter that they meet again. A postcard from Twist alerting Ennis about his impending arrival is received with a jolt of excitement and their re-union ignites the connection anew. Over the next sixteen or seventeen years, the men meet with some regularity, seemingly more as time goes on. Both marriages suffer as a result. However the relationship is not fulfilling for either man. Both men consider the opportunities they might have missed and whether they should have made more of a commitment. Ennis' marriage breaks up although it is perhaps more owing to stress bought on by financial insecurity than to his affair, which his wife is aware of. Ennis cannot form a new relationship with women which speaks to the depth of feeling he has for Jack while Jack becomes increasingly needy and shrill in condemning Ledger for refusing to make a stronger commitment to the relationship. The film chronicles with heartbreaking austerity the pain in their forbidden relationship. The relationship is not fulfilling for either man but at the same time, both derive much pleasure and satisfaction from it, which keeps it going. Lee has a mastery of the material and knows that the long- term heartbreak is more searing than occasional moments of passion. The film stays with you and the sense of regret that characterizes it has an undeniable emotional heft. The acting, in particular from Ledger and Williams, is fantastic. Both are from traditional, conventional homes and both are well-mannered. The toll that poverty takes on their marriage is rarely spoken of and when either lashes out, the words are all the more cutting for their rarity. Both are likable characters and one wishes the best for them and as one sees the toll that Ledger's infidelity and the scarcity of money has on the couple, one feels sadness as surely as one does in any film. Lee allows his actors to act and does not constrict them with manipulative aesthetic elements such as musical cues or cinematographic choices. The cinematography is sparse and simple and the music is similarly low-key. Both choices re-enforce the essential loneliness underlining the film. Fantastic film and although I have not seen Crash, I find it hard to believe that it is better than this film.",Brokeback Mountain
194,adventure-21903,Masterpiece with Shattering Performance by Heath Ledger,10,6 May 2020,Brokeback Mountain And Lee's magnificent film was the best movie of the year. It was robbed of the Oscar as was Heath Ledger for his brilliant performance of Ennis the rancher who falls in love with Truitt played memorably by Jake Gyllenhall.This movie about two men who fall in love is brilliant.The story is well known by now. The scenery of the open west and the 4 performances of the 4 principal players is landmark acting. Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams are perfection as the women in the lives of Ennis and Truit.Ang Lee takes the ultimate in male macho the rugged Cowboy and turns it into a love story between two men. Every time Isee this miracle of a film I learn new things.It is in the company of Vertigo and a few other movie masterpieces that define what outstanding movie making is about.Brokeback Mountain from start to finish is a gem of a movie. Hurrah for the cast and crew and especially Messrs Lee and Ledger.Heath Ledger is so great in this movie he was destined to be the #1 actor worldwide.RIP Heath!,Brokeback Mountain
195,JoshtheGiant,The Best of the Year,10,15 January 2006,"Brokeback Mountain has been called many things that include ""The Gay Cowboy Movie"" and ""Racist"" The film is far from being either, on the other hand it is pretty much the opposite of racist and calling it ""The Gay Cowboy Movie"" Is a huge mistake. First of all about the gay cowboy thing they are presumably bi-sexual, not homosexual, and they may even not be that because particularly Ennis doesn't seem to be interested in any other men besides Jack. Brokeback Mountain is also in my opinion and instant classic, and a film everyone should see at one point or another. The plot: Two men in their early twenties try out for a summer job of caring for and herding several hundred sheep on Brokeback Mountain together. They are Ennis Del Mar a soft-spoken disturbed man who has a woman (Alma) waiting to marry him when he returns. And Jack who is the elder of the two is more outspoken and used to and easier life. He is also the first to give in to the desire he feels for Ennis. They learn that one has too sleep illegally up on the peak of the mountain with the sheep to take care of them and that the other will stay at the main camp cook and such. One day they shoot an elk and have a party. They get drunk and it gets dark and they decide Ennis should just stay there for the night. He at first sleeps outside he tent but after getting really cold moves in with Jack. After some awkward situations they make love. The next day they are both scared and disturbed and say to each other that it was a one-time thing but they both know they want more. After several days they fall into bed again, and again and slowly fall in love. Jack and Ennis part at the end of the summer, both marry Ennis to Alma and Jack to a rodeo cowgirl named Laureen in Texas. They both have children and don't meet again for four years. This chain of events leads to a twenty yearlong secret love affair on Brokeback Mountain. Brokeback Mountain is one of the hardest films to watch since Raging Bull, and possibly one of the best since than too. The performances in particular are wonderful. Jake Gyllenhaal is in my opinion the stand out as Jack, he gives the best male supporting performance since Brad Pitt in 12 Monkeys, and I will venture to say one of the best ever. Heath Ledger would probably come in second as Ennis. He gives a performance that reminds us of a young Marlon Brando. Ledger is completely unrecognizable in his roll, he has been for a long time a teen heart throb playing in movies like A Nights Tale and Ten Things I Hate About You, but this year he has really come into his own giving two wonderful performances in Lords of Dogtown and Brokeback Mountain. Michelle Williams plays Alma and although she can't top the men she still gives a wonderful performance. She has some wonderful scenes in which she grieves over finding out about Ennis's affair but still can't help loving him. Anne Hathaway shows surprising depth as Laureen Jacks wife. Her performance is easily the most underrated of the year and surpasses that of Michelle Williams who is headed towards Oscar gold. Her accent never breaks and she has so much emotion hidden just under the surface. The screenplay is also wonderfully written by the master who gave us The Last Picture Show. He crafts his characters so perfectly, and between the wonderful acting and the writing we don't really need his wonderful dialogue to get everything. Ang Lee has given us some wonderful films before such as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, Sense and Sensibility, and The Ice Storm. They are always different from anything done before, and this Brokeback Mountain is probably his best. Brokeback will certainly have a good run at the Oscars this year with locks for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor, and Supporting Actress, and is expected to win many of them including Best Picture and it is one of the few films in years that actually deserves it. I suggest that you see this masterpiece whether you wait for the DVD or not, it is simply a must see.",Brokeback Mountain
196,ldavis-2,Ride 'Em Cowboy!,3,26 December 2005,"Although based on a story written by a straight woman, directed by a straight man, starring actors who are straight (one of whom is dating his movie wife), ""Brokeback Mountain"" has become a litmus test for society's tolerance of the so-called gay lifestyle. It reminds me of the self-congratulatory hoopla over ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,"" a film made by the very people who saw to it that blacks never played anything more substantial than maids and train porters! Such films exist solely to make the elitists look good and feel good -- which is why it will make out like a bandit on Oscar night!The filmmakers want you to conclude that Jack and Ennis don't get to live happily ever after because of ""intolerance"". Oddly, this ""intolerance"" demands that the boys choose to betray those fool enough to love them. If they weren't such selfish pricks (give Ennis points for feeling bad about the sheep being killed while he was, uh, busy), I could have gotten on board. But each treats his wife like crap, and Jack sleeps with other men! Don't give me the line that the boys they ""had"" to marry: Ennis could have broken his engagement, and it was perfectly acceptable back then for a man to be a ""confirmed bachelor"". And when his true love dies, is Ennis devastated? Hardly! His run-in with that bear had more depth!As for their ""historic"" hook-up, you'll find more explicit stuff on basic cable! The boys never show us their ""fishing gear"", but the girls show us their ""bait"" -- that's Hollywood's idea of progress, kiddies! Worse, the movie utterly fails to convey gay love as natural, what with all the jokes just begging to be cracked about the boys eating beans and sleeping with sheep!If the story was about a guy and a girl or two girls, would the movie condemn the lovers for betraying his/her partner, or excuse the affair? When the elitists regard minorities as fellow human beings instead of cynically patronizing them with pretentious tripe like ""Brokeback Mountain"", then they can consider themselves enlightened.",Brokeback Mountain
197,roland-104,Fresh entry in the canon of American tragic love stories; Ledger's acting turn is stupendous,9,25 December 2005,"Heath Ledger offers one of the finest performances in memory by an actor in an American film as Ennis Del Mar, one of the two star-crossed lovers in this tragic tale of homosexual longing and desire set in the wilds of the Wyoming high country grasslands. Ennis is paired up with Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal), a third rate rodeo cowboy, when the two sign on as sheepherders in the summer of 1963.Their erotic hunger for one another emerges almost immediately after they settle into their routine with the herd in the high country. From their bear cub-like foreplay scuffles, to tender scenes of their kisses and embraces, to the serious throes of their intercourse, the mutual attraction and consummation of lovemaking of this couple are believable to the core.After this summer of love, the men go their separate ways. They each eventually marry, have children, settle down. Ennis stays in a tiny mountain town in Wyoming, barely scraping by as a ranch hand and cattle drive herder. Jack drifts to Texas, rodeoing, where he pairs up with the daughter of a prosperous small town farm machinery dealer, who grudgingly takes Jack in as the lead salesman. Jack and Ennis meet once a year for a tryst, when Jack drives north and the two go off together on ""fishing trips"" to the high country where they first had met and discovered their love for one another.What makes Ledger's role so memorable (I kept thinking of his Ennis and visualizing him for days afterward) is not so much his lovemaking, good as it is, but rather the immense complexity of the character he plays. Gruff, rough, moody, surly. A simple but passionate man. At some moments, explosive as a powderkeg. Nearly mute at other times in his inability to express the power of his feelings. Visibly trapped - cornered even - in his poverty. Tender and caring as a father and, to the extent he can muster, as a dutiful husband. Ennis's excitement, his joy of anticipation, is palpable when the moment of Jack's annual visit nears.Gyllenhaal's role is less complex though acted well enough. His Jack is a more garrulous, forthcoming fellow, who wears his needs and his feelings on his sleeve. Unlike Ennis, whose forbearance is huge, Jack does not easily suppress his impulse for homoerotic contacts. He visits male prostitutes in a Mexican border town and begins to strike up what hints to become a relationship with another married man in his Texas hometown. Jack's inability to stifle his impulses proves in the long run to be his undoing.The screenplay by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana was adapted from a short story by E. Annie Proulx. Canada stands in for Wyoming for the location shots. The photography, by Mexican cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (""Fibra óptica,"" ""Amores perros,"" ""Frida,"" ""8 Mile,"" ""21 Grams""), is sometimes stunning, in particular the sheep herding scenes early on. Director Ang Lee masters yet another film genre here (Westerns) and evokes fine performances not only from his lead actors but several excellent supporting performers, including Randy Quaid, Anne Hathaway, Michelle Willliams, Kate Mara, Roberta Maxwell and Peter McRobbie.This film deserves a proper place among tragic American love classics such as ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" ""Casablanca,"" ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller,"" ""A Place in the Sun,"" ""West Side Story"" and ""Wild at Heart.""

198,wnterstar,Hauntingly Beautiful!,9,6 January 2006,"This movie goes down as one of the most haunting I've ever seen. It's the story of star-crossed lovers with a twist. Ennis Delmar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) are two cowboys hired to watch a herd of sheep over the summer. During that summer, they have only each other for company and get to know each other very well. The rest of the story is how their relationship affects their lives. They can't be together, but being apart is almost torture, not only for them, but for their families. It was not about sex but about their deep, passionate, enduring love. The sex scenes were tastefully shot, not graphic, and not sleazy.Jake Gyllenhaal was amazing and the only bad thing I can say about Heath Ledger's acting is that I wanted to tell him to stop mumbling several times during the film. The supporting cast was terrific as well.The only real problem I had with the film is that I thought a couple of the scenes were needlessly brutal.

The movie told us then, about Ennis and Jack (The two Cowboys)in the 60s. Without being known, the both must work in the called ""Brokeback Mountain"" to care about a lot group of animals which must be there for its owner. We don't know nothing about this guys, and the movie little by little, going to told us they dreams and they fears. And how they going to find certain affection. The plot could be more simple if we ignore all the social topics.The movie was the sensation in almost all the world, but the thing that surprised me is if, in all the gay movies that exist, this is the best. I don't think so. I think that there are much gay films better than this. But in spite of that, of course, this one treat a different topic: The real love which born from our hearts. The performances are good too: Jack Gyllenhaal, Heath Ledger, Michelle Williams, Larry Reese, Randy Quaid and Anne Hathaway. But maybe the points that take our hearts are 3: The soundtrack, the photography and the ending. The music composed by Santaolalla is really enjoyable and memorable, gives it the essence of western that the film needs. The photography, or i better say the scenario is tremendous and natural, which gives to the film a warm, kind but biter air, a bitter aspect. Finally, the ending is a sad look of nostalgia, so hard that we feel the feelings of Ennis. And at the ending of that old clothes, and the closed door.This work of Ang Lee is incomparable -althoug not superior to others- that should, and surely going to be remembered for a lot of time.*Sorry for the mistakes...well, if there any.",Brokeback Mountain
200,Mitch-38,A Piece of American Western Heritage which happens to be Gay,7,31 January 2006,"CAUTION TO THE READER-SPOILERS AHEAD: Director Ang Lee's film BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN delves deeply into the American psyche. A psyche of puritanical, almost rabid, reverence for the cowboy myths and legend. They were truly the U.S. version of ""The Nobility of the Sword."" They entered hostile and unknown lands, making a slow path for the rest of immigrant and established America to follow westward. Some of it is bona fide American history, much of it sketchy legend. Then, we flash forward to the early 1960's where the last bastion of independent cowboy employment is reaching its finale, of sorts. They are lone cowboys not belonging or working for any particular ranch. Against this backdrop is where we meet the main characters of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar, two drifters looking for work in Wyoming.The work is hard and the pay was low, however these were men who needed money. We, as viewers, take this journey with them and discover an indirect affection between them. As this affection evolves into the physical act of love, we find both characters struggling with their perceptions built upon their life up to now, and their emotions. For individual reasons and reasoning, Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar keep their love, yet lose their happiness, much due to the mores and times in which they live. One of these men find life away from Wyoming, and moves to Texas. His life takes a path where he doesn't want it to go, yet makes his way with success in a chameleon-like existence. He is bold and visionary, and not afraid of life's chances, if only the man he loves would dare to jump for the brass ring of happiness. He is not interested in a solo act, it has to be a team effort. Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger are simply great. A standout performance is delivered by Michelle Williams as Alma, and Anne Hathaway as Lureen. Graham Beckel and Randy Quaid provide solid, entertaining support. Peter McRobbie and Roberta Maxwell are terrific, as Jack's parents. The viewer cannot help but get involved into the lives of these men. The fluidity of the screenplay, thanks to Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana the screenwriters, keep your interest in the raw emotions, subtle tenderness and warm humor of the plight of these two men. It illustrates the anguish that such relationships with men or women can be wrought when true honesty is absent. The screenplay succeeds most of the time in its intent. Unfortunately, it tends to falter near the critical juncture of its conclusion. No one is saying these two should hold hands and go skipping off into the sunset. That certainly would not have been a realistic ending, considering the travails of Ennis and Jack. A tender, yet long overdue understanding and acceptance of each other would have sufficed. However, the oldest cliché in Hollywood history was dusted off, and presented as the dessert, after a spectacular five course meal. I'll let you ponder a guess. Question: In Hollywood film production, when two star-crossed lovers meet and pursue romance, you can almost bet your last check that one of them will...? a) Win the lottery. b) Move to The Netherlands where it's not illegal. or c) Get whacked or murdered. It is a strong critique of an otherwise brilliant movie. Therefore, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is certainly well above average, and worthy of your consideration for emotional and intellectually stimulating entertainment. You will not be disappointed in the least. The almost 2.5 hour run flows effortlessly by, due in large thanks to the pacing by director Lee. Highly Recommended.",Brokeback Mountain
201,NJMoon,Gonna Build A MOUNTAIN...,8,9 January 2006,"...from a little hill. From a short story at the back of a collection of Wyoming tales by Annie Proulx comes this incredible film. Short stories seem to serve well as the basis for screenplays, leaving lots of 'space' for visuals. Here, the landscape of Wyoming is the backdrop for one of the most moving and unique romances since Romeo wooed Juliet. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are the central figures. Gyllenhaal is a master of charm - with a glint in his eye and a winning smirk. Ledger broods and mumbles in a performance that is reminiscent of (but never competes with) the memory of a young Marlon Brando. Despite the film's male-centric plotting, the female cast members are just as riveting. Anne Hathaway's final scene is played to perfection and Michelle Williams is the emotional core of the story. Both women are every bit as watchable and talented as their male co-stars. From a modest beginning, director Ang Lee has crafted a memorable and emotional journey. This is a mountain of a film.",Brokeback Mountain
202,manendra-lodhi,A nice bisexual story.,8,30 May 2012,"The film focuses on the bisexual relationship between two men. In how many films do you get a chance to see this? A nice film about the film that could change your view towards these people. Beautifully scripted. Although I must say the characters were complex to understand. You will find yourself engaging in the talks all the time especially when the two of them talked. These characters showed that they are man and not afraid of things unlike in many other films in which gays are shown like timid people. OK they were bisexual. I found everything perfect in the film. But only one thing that seemed awkward to me was that everything seemed to happen so fast (other than the chemistry between themselves), like meeting a new girl and than marrying so quickly. I mean the period of four years between them was shown so quickly. As if other characters did not mean anything to the story. But anyway it did served the purpose well. Engaged me with the story all the time.""A recommended watch for all loving nice scripts on different subjects and not bothered with slow paces of films""",Brokeback Mountain
203,galensaysyes,Desire of object obscure,7,14 November 2008,"With different actors, this might have been a beautiful little film. With those present, it's likable and suggestive, but too remote from its subject. Perhaps it could have used a different director as well, because the subject appears to be outside this one's natural range.The subject (surprisingly, given the publicity that surrounded the film) is not homosexuality, in its own right, but the power of desire. The particular case shown happens to be the desire of one man for another, but it could as easily be for anyone else not allowable. The characters possessed by it seem as straight as they are queer, so that what their encounter with each other opens up may or may not be their innermost nature. In either case, and more importantly, it's the fulfillment of the strongest desire they've ever experienced or can imagine. The rest of the film traces which ways they go, and how far, under its sway.Plenty of films have shown characters throwing all away for the sake of passion. But generally their stories are presented as tragedies or comedies. This is the only one to show the series of little, everyday, foolish or wayward acts to which a man can be drawn by the irresistibly compelling, almost besotting force of a temptation. The excitement it introduces into his mind, crowding everything else into a corner; his fear and longing for it, which throw him into a kind of fog through which everything else looks vague and far away; his shunting aside of family, friends, job, all the obligations that seemed important before now dropped while he runs after his desire; the fabricating of stories to explain where he's off to, and the excuses he makes to himself; his feeling sorry afterwards, and even while he's doing it--but then, not truly.... At some time nearly everyone goes through something like this, or consciously resists it. The case shown is of a man wanting another man, but the condition is universal.The film observes it with great sympathy and accuracy of detail. It traces all the big steps in the characters' lives of desire: the preoccupation, concealments, getaways, and so forth. These, rather than the strict time sequence, are the basis of the chronology. And so perhaps they should be. But this structure leads to some jarring rifts in the straight timeline. For instance, one of the characters meets a woman, and a scene or two later she's bearing his child. I accepted these jumps to an extent, as approximations of the characters' own perceptions of their lives, but they tended to throw me out of the film and ought to have been managed more adroitly.I've read complaints that the film is slow. So it is, compared to films set in big cities. But it proceeds at the tempo of the Western towns where it's set and of the Westerners who live in them. If they moved faster, their actions would not only be unlifelike but would be robbed of their meaning.Where the film falls shorter is in the leading performances. The two actors are agreeable, but not good enough for their roles (or the roles weren't right for them). To be sure, the script doesn't give these enough definition, but the actors don't fill in the spaces. And they don't seem quite right otherwise. They don't seem of the place or of the period; in their scenes together, they don't seem to know each other or to be with each other. (In scenes with some other characters, they do.) Most crucially, they don't communicate any desire for each other, which is what the story turns on. In their sexual scenes, one has to infer this. And the action itself (as usual in sexual scenes) tells almost nothing about them.Perhaps the director or the screenwriters did intend the film to be about homosexuality. The last reel, approximately, so suggests. It takes a different, more sentimental direction than expected (I wonder if this was added on to the original short story). A more logical close might have been for one partner to lose his desire, or to feel it swamping him so much he had to give it up. The film's close isn't about desire at all; it's about love. To be sure, there's a relation between the two, but the film doesn't make clear what it is, or how we got to one from the other, so that the new facts we learn about the characters in this section feel like footnotes.The town settings at the beginning are almost painfully authentic in their quietness, the sharp sunlight, the cold heat of the air and the sun. I only stopped believing when the actors stepped in.The mountain is never as real as the town. Probably that's because its meanings are never communicated in visual terms. The narrative meaning is probably a literary one that no actual place could measure up to; the emotional meaning could be caught, but only with effort. It would have to grow out of the characters' everyday interactions with the place, first in their work and then, gradually, in their personal relations. But the details of these are scamped, so that we only glimpse, but never feel, the atmosphere unique to the place: the bite of the wind, the hardness of the ground, the steepness of the climb to the grazing field, the denseness of the herd; then, the relative comforts of the camp and, even more, the tent; and finally, the releasing of an urge that's been straining at its cinches, and the association of that freedom with the place where it happened. Some films achieve that kind of identification of landscape with interior feeling.But first must come the feeling.",Brokeback Mountain
204,Ric-7,Much More Than Just Hype,10,28 December 2005,"I wish very much that I had seen this film without knowing anything at all about it, and so my appreciation of it would not be colored by my expectations. I found the film to be a nice little film--entertaining, beautiful, extremely well-acted, and often very moving. But I don't think that it was intended by its director to be a trend-setter, or to make a statement, or to strike a blow for equality. And the fact that I could enjoy the film as a fascinating story, and at the end find it to be a ""nice little film,"" rather than political statement, is a further testament to Ang Lee's artistry.Ultimately, whether or not there are many other persons ""just like that,"" or whether life in Wyoming is ""just like that,"" the more important fact is that the film convinces us that there COULD be, and that it is difficult to criticize the characters for the choices they made.My only complaints about the film (minor ones, admittedly) are that I thought the makeup--specifically the fake mustache and the sideburn extensions, could have been improved; and I am not sure what Heath Ledger had in his mouth to make him sound like that--I never saw him dipping snuff.SECOND VIEWING: I have raised my rating. After seeing the film again, there was so much more that I had not noticed before--a sign of an excellent film. The last 5 minutes of this film are absolutely unforgettable.",Brokeback Mountain

There have been a lot of movies about gay love or gay couples that were critically acclaimed, but most of the reviewers talk about this film as it was the first movie ever made about homosexual love, which is not true.Despite that, this movie was enjoyable and well directed, unlike other boring and pretentious dramas that always win the Academy Awards for Best picture.The performances were good (But I think that the performance of Heath Ledger in ""The Dark Knight"" was better) and the characters were interesting. The last scene was very emotional and dramatic.Despite some boring scenes, this film was worth-watching and well made. But I still must insist that this movie was overrated.",Brokeback Mountain
206,ilovedolby,Powerful!,10,8 January 2006,"This is a very emotionally painful film to watch, and for many more reasons than the obvious. Certainly the story is upsetting when you see two people who are deeply in love with each other and because of circumstance it cannot be pursued, or must be kept a secret. But what about the people involved in the whole circle, and the times they live in. These two men, Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhall) meet as young sheepherders in 1963. They are from the Great Plains where the notions of everyday people are not really liberal or fair-minded. They know the danger that could await them if their secret got out. Moreover, what about their families? Each character has children and a wife. How would this affect their relationships with those members? Obviously their wives would probably divorce them and maybe they would never see their children again. All these men eventually have is a seasonal trip to Brokeback Mountain where they first met. The film is not shy about the subject homosexuality or showing the intimacy of their relationship. But I never found it to be anything offensive, pornographic, amoral, etc. This movie is not a film that seeks the why of anything. It does not try to be a psychological, physiological or morality study. It is simply a tragic love story between two people who are forced to keep their affections a secret. Nothing more or less, this is the reason why the film is so painful to watch. It strikes an emotional core that we can all relate to. The performances are outstanding, especially Ledger's, as he is the protagonist of the film. But that's not to down Gyllenhall is any way. He's a fine young actor and I've been a fan of his ever since I saw ""October Sky"" in 1999. What is more? The cinematography is breathtaking. Ang Lee's direction is terrific. He's a director who has quite a diverse palletfrom ""Sense & Sensibility, ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" even ""Hulk"" was a fine film. There have been other films that have tackled gay relationships before, but not so mainstreamed as this. And, certainly not with one of the greatest and most conservative of American imagesthe cowboy.",Brokeback Mountain

208,moutonbear25,What a view!,10,8 January 2006,"BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN Written by Larry McMurtry & Diana Ossana Directed by Ang LeeBefore the accolades began falling around Ang Lee's modern western, hype had already planted its spurs into the public's anticipation. It was becoming known as ""The Gay Cowboy Movie."" Yes, it's gay and yes, the leads are cowboys but that title doesn't do justice to the love that grows between these two men throughout the span of a twenty-year period. A love that lasts that long despite every challenge is the foundation of a good home. It cannot be explained or defined; it merely is. The fact that it is between two men is not relevant. All that matters is that the love itself lives on and the two affected by that pull are man enough to face it.Brokeback Mountain is a quiet film that takes place in a simpler time. Conversations don't run long or deep; the buildings in town are no more than two stories high; and work involves using your hands when you can find it. And if you were a man, you made sure you found that work to ensure having enough money to raise the family you were about to create. There was no time to waste wondering about where your life could take you as the life that you had brought with it certain responsibilities. If that meant herding sheep up on Brokeback Mountain all summer, then you made sure you were the first in line to get that job. The first two in line for the job here are Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, respectively). Ennis and Jack meet each other in silence outside an office where they await work orders. And though they say nothing until they both have the job and are sharing a drink in celebration, they sneak glances when the other isn't looking. It isn't long before they're on the mountain, a mountain of immense beauty with lively rivers and protective forestry. The sheep they are herding move up the mountain in waves and flow like the river they walk alongside. And once the two men, their dog and the hundreds of sheep have reached their camp, the foundation of love begins to be laid down. Amidst the purity of the nature that surrounds them, something innately natural begins to emerge, tying these two men together in a way they had never expected. They build themselves a home without even realizing as one tends to the camp all day while the other goes out to labour with the sheep. When Jack no longer wants to eat beans, Ennis makes sure to get soup despite his distaste for it. When Ennis cuts his head after being thrown from his horse, Jack is there with a wet towel to wipe away the blood. Their caring is shown through actions that come without thinking. They may not be able to verbalize the compassion one has for the other but the words aren't necessary anyway. The trust they build opens the door for the men to share about their past lives and future hopes, neither having felt this safe with someone else before. And as their intimacy deepens, they are seen wearing less clothing, lingering longer before looking away until, on one cold night, Ennis joins Jack in the tent for a night that changes their lives forever. It is one thing to walk around all day after you've had sex the night before when you weren't expecting to. It is a whole other thing when you've had that sex with someone of the same sex when you didn't think that was who you were. And it is yet another thing entirely when that someone is someone you care about. This turmoil can be read all over the face of Ennis, played with a fierce stoicism by Ledger whose silence screams how deeply he internalizes his confusion. Jack on the other hand, will not say how much he loves Ennis but will sing loud and proud about his happiness. And though the two will reach an understanding that their lives are not complete without each other, the complicated nature of their relationship creates a direct contrast to the simplicity that surrounds them. Consequently, this complexity seeps into their regular every day lives, threatening everything they've worked for.Lee's love story is both tender and tragic. It's somber acoustic guitar score carries you gently along for the journey as it exposes all the trappings life has to offer. Ennis himself says it best when he says, ""If you can't fix it, you gotta stand it."" And this certainly applies to his career of unsteady work or loveless marriage (his wife, Alma, played by Michelle Williams in a revelatory and eruptive performance). Jack knows better though. Jack knows that Ennis and him have what it takes to have the good life, that they're love is the kind that everyone wishes they had. Theirs is a love is that helps you through your problems if you let it grow but it is also a love that brings you nothing but trouble if you keep it all boxed up.Brokeback Mountain is an important film and one that I've been looking forward to all year. It is a film that transcends its homosexual imagery allowing for the communication of the basic elements of the story to reach the viewer, any viewer. I took a deep breath before watching in an attempt to remove some of my expectations but I'm glad to say that it was everything I had hoped for it to be. Lee has created a benchmark film about how love can take hold of any two people at any time. I cried three times before the credits ran and was barely able to speak after the lights came up. My big, tall cowboy hat is off to you, Mr. Lee.",Brokeback Mountain
209,Irie212,A meritorious subject does not guarantee a meritorious film,3,13 August 2009,"Like most people who saw ""Brokeback Mountain,"" I came wanting to like it because I am morally involved with the subject matter. In the end, though, whatever compassion I felt for the two men came from my principles, not film itself. Their longing for each other is embedded in the screenplay, but the only reason I had to believe that they were in love was that I was told it. I never felt it.Dealing with homosexuality as a forbidden subject accounts, to some considerable degree, for the fawning reception this film received. But a meritorious subject does not guarantee a meritorious movie. If it did, then the drab rehab movie ""28 Days"" would be a classic and the racist ""Birth of the Nation"" could not be.While the failed marriages of the two men were convincing, their failed chemistry left me unmoved. But that wasn't the only problem, of course. Ingrid Bergman and Cary Grant could be kissing in 35mm and it wouldn't overcome Ang Lee's stale direction. I'll confine myself to three main complaints: 1) the watching-paint- dry pace that makes this 2-hour movie seem longer than a 20-inning baseball game; 2) the gutless country music soundtrack, which is Santaolalla's worst work; and 3) Ledger's incoherent mumbling, for which there is never any excuse. Mumbling was one of Brando's signatures, but his artistry was such that he delivered the emotional essence.It would be shorter to say what's right with ""Brokeback"": the Alberta and Wyoming locations, and Michelle Williams.By the way, for real chemistry between men in a far more effective and important movie on the subject of homosexuality, see ""Victim"" (1961). The screen is never even shared by Dirk Bogarde and Peter McEnery, but the strength of their forbidden love — in England, criminal love until 1967-- is all the more powerful for including scenes explicitly addressing the tragic political and social bigotry.",Brokeback Mountain
210,screenwriter-14,BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a timeless love story and a film for the ages,10,11 December 2005,"From the moment BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN opens to the vastness of the green mountains, to the closing scene with a green field blowing in the wind through a window, Ang Lee has delivered ""a timeless love story and a film for the ages"" that is one of the most beautiful, haunting, and memorizing films in 2005. The LA Critics got it right as BEST PICTURE of 2005 and this film deserves all the accolades that it can garner.Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger are simply two cowboys who fall in love on BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN and take this love all through their lives to the final conclusion. What a shame this love between two people could not have been one they would have shared, rather than the one ""we dare to show openly"". The pain which Enis goes through and the loneliness both he and Jack feel when they are apart will haunt me forever, as well as the audience.The supporting cast, the writing and the wonderful, visual development of the characters, Enis and Jack, is a masterful stroke directed by Ang Lee. Cinematography and the simplicity of the music against the beauty of the mountains and the love affair of Enis and Jack are visions to store in your ahead when the right person comes along in your life and you are not afraid to embrace that love for the world to see.BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN transcends the love between two men, and brings to the screen a powerful story of friendship and love.

It's rather disconcerting to realize how much of the movie-going public is uptight about sex and obviously unable to discern the difference between a loving relationship involving two men and the weekend romp of a couple of screw-buddies.Contrary to popular belief, there is no love between the men in this story. Not one scene is devoted to showing how the two cowboys might feel love for each other. No heart-felt conversations, no gentle holding of hands, just random opportunities for them to patronize the nearest cockroach-infested motels.... gee, how romantic. And what wonderful guys they are, disrespecting their wives by cheating on them the whole time. It certainly takes a lot of integrity to do that.Maybe somebody will get it right the next time by painting a picture of two men whose love for one another transcends the boundaries of the sex act, instead of trying to fool the smarter people in the audience (like me) who have the brains and the passion to see what this wannabe ""love story"" is really about: a cheap 24-hour roll in the hay between trick-buddies in a musty tent on a lame mountain called Brokeback.... no thanks.",Brokeback Mountain
215,budmassey,The hallmarks of greatness.,10,9 March 2006,"The hallmarks of greatness are scattered through Brokeback Mountain. Directed with exquisite beauty by Ang Lee, the only director out there with a soul these days, BBM is a lilting surfeit of beauty of an aching, melancholy kind. Of course, Lee could coax beauty from unexposed film stock, but fortunately, he had a bit more to work with here.Writing credits are impeccable. Anne Proulx has proved time and again that she deserves her place among such masters of the short story as Joyce Carol Oates. When BBM first appeared in The New Yorker, the literati were quick to embrace it. Add to that the brilliant screen writing of Larry McMurtry, and you've got story pretty well nailed.From an acting perspective, aren't we all tired of signature performances that could have been phoned in by actors who make a living playing themselves? Heath Ledger delivers a stunning performance not only in its own right, but particularly in comparison to the diversity of work he has rendered thus far. For an Austrailian actor previously known for pin-up boy roles to capture with such intensity and ferocity, not to mention accuracy, the wild and rough nature of the American cowboy defines acting.But most defining was the fact that, had the part of Jack been a female role, Jake Gyllenhaal would have been nominated for a leading role instead of a supporting role. Even Hollywood was not prepared to deal with a gay love story of such power and import, and the concept of two male leads was too much for even the MPAA to process. That, in fact, is the very definition of art, to push boundaries and redefine concepts.The fact that BBM became so instantly iconic, whether for better or worse, is proof positive of its historical and artistic importance. Let me put it this way. A friend once asked me why I decided to get a piercing, and I said to separate that part of my life before I had it from the part after. Hollywood will henceforth be likewise divided; that part before Brokeback Mountain, and what came after.",Brokeback Mountain
216,jay4stein79-1,Satisfactory,7,2 January 2006,"Do you know how excited I became when my screenwriter friend told me Ang Lee was making Brokeback Mountain with Heath Ledger, Anne Hathaway, and Jake Gyllenhaal? I just about flipped my wig, more or less. I just about drooled at the thought of Ang Lee tackling the landscape of the American West (here is a man whose Ice Storm continues to color my experiences of driving through southern Connecticut and Westchester--every time I pass by Rye and look at my surroundings I can't help but think of that film). And the actors? They're among my favorite young actors. That's not even mentioning the brutal story by Proulx, which ranks among my favorites shorts of all time (significantly better than anything else I've read by her). So what happened? My idyll began unraveling around the time I saw the trailer for Brokeback, which was closely followed by an article in the Times about how the film executives planned on marketing this film as a romance. Well, it is, but looking at the images that floated through the preview it became apparent that it would also be Romantic. I hoped my instincts were incorrect; I hoped they wouldn't transform a very gritty and sexual story into a beautiful and sensual tale of woe. Proulx's prose, as Stephen Holden wrote in his review of the film, is tough and gnarled. It reminded me of an old man's knobby hands. That this style told the tale of the doomed lovers made the story all the more affecting. Jack and Ennis are Marlboro men and Proulx told their story the way they would tell it themselves. Yes it was a sad and touching romance, but it never forgot what type of men these were. The film, unfortunately, fails to translate that style visually. The film is stunning to look at but the tale is completely Romanticized visually. In that way, it becomes more sentimental too. That's the gravest fault I can find in the film. Ang Lee managed to transform a tale of romance into an actual Romance. Moreover, the grand vistas of the West inflate this story. Proulx's tale was terse and gritty and small. The film looks epic and feels that way too. These things should not have occurred. Allow me to quote from the Proulx story: ""The room stank of s***n and smoke and sweat and whiskey, of old carpet and sour hay, stale leather, s**t and cheap soap."" My censorship lessens the impact slightly, but I think that makes my point. Ang Lee did the same thing. The above sentence describes the motel room after their reuniting tryst. Mr. Lee took all that and cast the room in a rosy light. He casts the whole movie in a rosy light, while the story is dusty, dirty, and tragic. Maybe it doesn't help that I fell in love with the story years ago. The impact of the movie--of Jack's death and the shirt within a shirt (one of the greatest images in contemporary literature)--was completely lost on me. I wasn't overwhelmed by sadness the way I was when I read the story, and I didn't cry. I cried during the previews, though, when the trailer for the film about the guy swimming across the English Channel played. I also cried at the end of King Kong and I well knew that the monkey was going to die. So then maybe it's not that I read the story but that there's something wrong with the movie--that it keeps you at arms length. That's probably true, as the Ice Storm did the same thing. At least there the distance and chill made sense and worked wonderfully; Mikey sliding lifeless down the road is still arresting. In other words, this movie just doesn't work the way it's supposed to. That said, it's beautiful to look at, never dull, and slightly daring. As others have pointed out, the love story is straight forward--no pun intended. There's nothing that you can't find in Titanic or Romeo and Juliet. Except the doomed affair occurs between two men (oh wait, that totally happened in Romeo and Juliet, at least on the Elizabethan stage). That's nice that a major motion picture has taken the subject of same sex relationships on, and something for which we should praise the filmmakers. They do a nice job creating a convincing same-sex relationship, which is an accomplishment, seeing as how most gay characters in Hollywood films fall into some stereotype or another. The acting is uniformly excellent as well, though I'm not as surprised as some by the turn Heath Ledger gives. It reminded me of his role in Monster's Ball. He wasn't there for long, but I remember thinking that he had something special that you couldn't see in A Knight's Tale. He does something amazing here, as he takes the more masculine of the men but allows something distinctly feminine broil under the surface. I couldn't help but feel that though he was physically the top in this relationship, emotionally he was the bottom. Gyllenhaal was quite good as well, finally proving that he can branch out. Remember that year he played the same character twice--once in the Good Girl and the other time in Lovely and Amazing? I'm not knocking him, but he had seemingly cornered the market Tobey Maguire left behind to play Peter Parker. Anne Hathaway was also a knockout as Lureen. The way her early scenes of soft sensuality transformed into a brittle hardness are impressive.This is a good movie, though a disappointing one for me. A lot of others really seem to adore this picture, and I wonder if it derives from the unfamiliarity with the source material or if the film managed to affect them in the same way the story did me.",Brokeback Mountain
217,ohlabtechguy,Thoroughly contrived gay cowboy romance...,9,24 October 2021,"Excellent acting, direction and cinematography is what elevated this movie despite the story line being stretched beyond all belief. The entire story had one goal....to show how society forces gay men to make unhappy choices that can end tragically. When the two love birds finally meet 4 years after their brief mountain top fling, they throw themselves madly at each other and kiss passionately as if they had been pining away for one another the whole time, in between getting married and starting families. Totally didn't buy it. And then for 20 years thereafter, they meet once a year to unleash a whole year's worth of carnal passion, all while smoking up a storm. Didn't buy it for one second as being plausible. Gay men generally have a lot of fleeting encounters. It's very very difficult for them to maintain a 20 year passionate romance under the circumstances portrayed in this movie. Hence, I took a star off this movie, which is otherwise well cast, directed and shot.",Brokeback Mountain
218,Dragoneyed363,Wonderful cinema; pleasantly surprising and heartbreaking,10,27 January 2009,"I had been putting off Brokeback Mountain for quite a while, mainly because, being a homosexual myself, I feared one of the most popular, gay, mainstream cinema releases would be entirely overrated in many ways, such as the writing and direction wouldn't be right or true to what the film needed to do, or it just wouldn't be able to capture what I would be expecting and live up to what I hoped it would be able to deliver, to an extent. Yes, here I am having doubts on a film that I should have been very excited to see, but I had just figured that the Independent filmmakers had been doing it right and now that homosexuality as a subject was becoming more popular that it would be picked at and prodded until what was being viewed on screen was a disgrace. After the film was over, I could not believe I avoided it for as long as I did and I was completely delighted to find a magnificent movie, even one of the most surprisingly surpassing that I had seen, in regards to my exceptions on films before. The story plot was really so touching and strongly perceived that I could feel what the main characters were going through, even though I had certainly never been in that exact situation, and the defining aspects of the plot were also due to the brilliant acting from both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall who captured the characters perfectly. There was not a weak point of entertainment in this movie, for it keeps your full attention through out and doesn't strain away from the main purpose of the film, even if it does stray a little from the main point of the actual story, in general, if you can understand what I mean by that statement.The execution was sheer ingeniousness everywhere you turned, and I could not have been as more content with the way this film ended up being as I was and still are. It was wonderful, and every film buff should at least consider giving it a chance, as they should many other homosexuality themed films, some of which I think are even better than this one, and not just cross them all out of their viewing queue because it is a homosexual movie, like a lot people in today's society would actually do. I loved it.",Brokeback Mountain
219,dhaufrect,Superb Lovestory,10,29 March 2006,"""Brokeback Mountain is a superb love story. It is a dramatic tragedy that is compelling in performance as well as in its cinema. The photography is panoramic. The acting is tender and dynamic at the same time. Jake Gyllenhall plays Jack Twist. Heath Ledger plays Ennis Del Mar. The two seek work from Randy Quaid who plays Joe Aguirre, an overweight manager of a large herd of sheep. As sheep ranchers the two of them spend lots of time on Brokeback Mountain to the point that they fall in love. Larry McMurtry's screenplay comes to life in a vivid way that may have shocked yesterday's moviegoer. However, the director, Ang Lee, has composed a masterpiece in that the scenes between these two are both believable and tastefully done. Even the music is coordinated to enhance the film, and the nomination for an academy award as best picture is relevant. I can highly recommend this movie. Put it on your ""must see"" list.",Brokeback Mountain
220,mosquitobite,Still packs such a punch,10,15 August 2021,"One of my favourite scenes in cinema is when Ennis grabs Jack when they first reunite.It was so intense because Ennis is by nature /nurture so emotionally stifled, it was just an explosion and wonderfully executed by Heath who I miss so much.People speculate about what Ennis was thinking of when he said "" Jack I swear..."" to me the finish f that sentence is ""...if I had my time again I'd find a way"".",Brokeback Mountain
221,guilfisher-1,Dirty rotten shame,10,5 March 2006,"Having just witnessed this year's Academy Awards, I almost threw up over the choice of CRASH over BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN as Best Picture of the year. It shows that money in big studios make winners for Oscar. What didn't make sense is giving the Best Director to Ang Lee for his masterful and courageous undertaking of bringing this story to the screen. But, of course, it was a small budget film. The big films have to get their money back.CRASH is a sordid, manipulating film with just about the ugliest characters ever put into one film. So, what's their message? Be an evil bigoted person, kill those who disagree and continue to take this country further into the abyss of hatred. I hated CRASH and everything it stood for. I couldn't watch too much of it.BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN brought back belief in oneself. It brought into the main stream public a love story. Not just about two guys, but about the right to love who you choose. Not murder who you choose as CRASH demonstrates. Unfortunately, Hollywood has gone back into the closet if we're to judge the academy voters. My hat's off to Lee and his amazing and trusting cast, cameraman, sound engineer, costumers, music composers and screenwriters. They have stepped up to bat with this movie, even though obviously by the voters choice the rest of Tinseltown remains in the closet.I won't relate the story. Go see this film. Don't wait for the DVD. See it on the big screen. It's well worth the time and effort. Support these film makers who dare to take chances and tell their stories with out violence and hatred. So be it. Both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were terrific together. Believable in their roles and you could see their trust in each other as actors to be able to play the intimate scenes. Bravo!Here's a bit of nonsense. Randy Quaid, who appears in less than 10 minutes of this movie as the stupid jock boss man, is now suing the producers for 10 million for his appearance. That's 1 million a minute, folks.Is anybody worth that? Please. With theaters suffering and actors begging for work, this sort of thing not only cheapens the business we're in but shows the greedy little so and sos that are taking all the money to the bank. It's out of balance, this movie business. And to me there's no one, no one, worth the price they are paid to schlep through any film. Mr. Quaid should kiss the ground he's working at all. And if a producer makes some money, that money will go into another film and more work for more actors. Move over Quaid, you ain't the only one in this business. I root for the producers and Mr. Lee for the vision and the guts to bring this to the screen. Not one measly actor who's out for himself. Who cares!",Brokeback Mountain
222,film_riot,Brokeback Mountain,9,18 November 2006,"What this movie comes down to is a love story, to be more specific, a story of love under difficult (almost impossible) circumstances. This kind of love stories have always been the most popular and we have often seen them. Despite being one of the best of them, Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Mountain"" adds the situation of the lovers being gay, which is the trigger for (almost) all of their problems. Or, more exactly, the real problems are caused by the society, which doesn't accept homosexuality, and the main characters treatment of it. When Ennis (Heath Ledger) tells Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) the story of how two gay men living together were killed when he was a child and then shown to him and his brother as a deterrent, this was just a scene that I won't forget. Later in the movie this image comes up again and gives you a punch right into your stomach. Much critical praise came over ""Brokeback Mountain"", I would say: Fully deserved.",Brokeback Mountain

Outstanding direction by Ang Lee and terrific performances made by Heath Ledger and Jake Gylanthal. Their scenes together were outstanding and heartfelt. Ledger was beyond perfect as the man who went through the pains of his feelings as a gay man at a time and place where it was considered forbidden. The ending broke my heart. You could see in his eyes what he was going through. It was nearly a perfect film with the exception of Randy Quaid in a small role. I found his character as despicable as he was in life. Quaid had and still has an offensive life-style and is openly disliked by every one that has ever worked with him. Fired by Equity Actor's Union for life speaks a lot about his character. A disgrace to us fellow actors. Maybe Mr. Lee saw this quality for the role and hired him. In any case I hope to never see him work again. We will miss Heath and all the work that we might have seen him do, had he lived longer. God rest his soul.",Brokeback Mountain

I can't add much to the other superlative reviews on this site except to say that Ang Lee is my favorite director and expect the unexpected in this deeply moving, beautifully performed, amazingly photographed, lovingly scored, perfectly scripted picture. In an early scene, Jack is in the foreground, while Ennis is have half-naked in the background and I said to my companion, he's going turn left to look at him. It didn't happen. That's the mark of a brilliant director (even other fine directors would have Jake glance over). Other untraditional sequences include Ennis' retching at summer's end, the reunion scene, Jack's truck breakdown, Ennis' emotional upheaval in a late fishing trip, and the final sequences that are beyond heart-wrenching. Hope it wins more and more awards.",Brokeback Mountain
226,ScottAmundsen,"Raw, Powerful, and Unforgettable",10,22 December 2011,"I remember when this movie first opened and it was being casually referred to by nearly everyone as ""the gay cowboy movie."" Knowing Ang Lee's work as I do, I knew before I saw it that it would be so much more than that, and I was not disappointed.1963. Two young cowboys, Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal), show up at the office of Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) looking for work as sheepherders. Jack is a friendly sort who introduces himself immediately, whereas Ennis is painfully shy and even getting his name out of him is like pulling teeth.The two young men are hired to tend the flocks on Brokeback Mountain. ""Tending the flocks"" involves some unforeseen hardships; they have only one tent, and each night one of them stays up to guard the sheep while the other sleeps. The nights on the mountain are frigid, however, and perhaps inevitably, they end up in the tent together for warmth. Up to this point there has been little communication between them; Ennis is shy and repressed to the point where he can barely string two words together, so Jack does most of the talking, getting little or no response. But in the tent that night, something clicks and the two men find themselves in the throes of passion, making love almost violently.Thus begins a love story that lasts through marriage and children and Jack's occasional trysts with male prostitutes. Every few years the two men get together for ""fishing trips"" on which no fish are ever caught, and even Ennis's somewhat naive wife Alma (Michelle Williams) gets the idea that something is up, especially after she sees the two of them kissing, a sight that shocks her but about which she does nothing since she has no frame of reference for what she has seen.Jack, too, has married. His wife Lureen (Anne Hathaway), however, is more sophisticated than Alma and at some point in the film catches on to what is happening, leading to increased tension in the home, and, if memory serves, divorce (It has been some time since I saw this film).Ang Lee's films range from the delightfully silly THE WEDDING BANQUET to the brilliant homage to martial arts films CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON, to this lovely and tragic love story, set at a time when love between two men (or two women) was not just an aberration, but the participants could find themselves in danger.As is his wont, Lee places his characters under a microscope and looks at them close-up, pores and all. Ledger is brilliant in an Academy Award-nominated performance as Ennis, a man so tied up inside that expressing himself is almost impossible; on more than one occasion, his frustration at his own lack of eloquence leads him to use his fists. Left alone at the end of the film, Ennis finally expresses the depth of his feeling for Jack in a silent scene that speaks louder than pages of dialogue.But for my money, as good as Ledger is, in many ways this is Gyllenhaal's film. Also Oscar-nominated, but in the Supporting Actor category, not only is his role every bit the equal of Ledger's, but a good portion of the story is told through Gyllenhaal's expressive eyes. Less repressed than Ennis, Jack is more willing to give voice to what he feels, and whenever he looks at his lover, it is with a longing that will bring tears to your eyes.The film also makes good use of the opportunity to make a few statements on what life was like for gay people in the period. Ennis is torn between the man he loves and his sense of obligation to play out the role of what he has been taught a ""real man"" should be. And in all fairness, he is not totally lacking in feeling towards Alma; he simply loves Jack more, a fact that shames him and makes him even more repressed except for the rare get-togethers with Jack.Jack, on the other hand, less repressed than his lover, finds himself drifting away from the woman that he married more out of convenience than real love, and in one rather sordid scene, availing himself of the services of a male prostitute in Mexico. Degrading, perhaps, but at least more honest than Ennis's life of near-total repression.The wives here are more than just accessories. Michelle Williams is brilliant as the innocent girl who marries Ennis, only to discover his secret later on. Totally unprepared, she initially says nothing, because she has no words to confront him with. The marriage does not last, of course, but the breakdown is painful to watch.Anne Hathaway as Lureen brings a cool breeze to the proceedings. Far less naive than Alma, she picks up on the fact that her husband is hiding SOMETHING fairly early on, and when the marriage ultimately collapses, she remains perfectly in control of herself; the impression is that she has seen this coming.Of course, the love story is what drives everything else in this film. It is the story of a love that endures despite societal disapproval, and in the face of marriages and children. It is perhaps inevitable that this story does not end happily for either of these men, but in the final moments of the film, Ennis at least acknowledges what he has had so much difficulty in putting into words.A beautiful film that rewards multiple viewings.",Brokeback Mountain
227,Laight,One of the Greatest Movies of All Time,10,23 January 2006,"There just hasn't been a movie this powerful made in America in years. It's an extraordinary confluence of the right director, the right screenwriters, the right actors, and the right time. By now everyone knows that the two lovers in the film are men, not a man and a woman. That in itself is pretty amazing. But plenty of movies have done that already. What this movie does is show that any two people--gay, straight, or anything else--can mess up their lives if they fall in love and can't figure out how to cope with their feelings. In this case, there's also pressure from society, but you could say that of Romeo and Juliet too, or Guess Who's Coming to Dinner--what makes this movie so startlingly beautiful is how the director et al. puts you inside the heads of two very likable people, and causes you to feel for them in ways you might not have felt before. You leave this movie when the two hours is over, but the movie never really leaves you.This movie will immediately make it on the top 10 lists of all time movies, and deservedly so.",Brokeback Mountain
228,teh_mode,"Beautiful, heartbreaking romance",8,12 January 2006,"Forget all the hype and hoopla you MAY have heard about Ang Lee's latest. This is not the controversial, left field gay western that it was originally advertised as, and which Ang Lee is desperate to eradicate. This is simply a beautiful, heartbreaking romance about two people who find each other in an unforgiving world. And they don't know what to do about it. In the summer of 1963 two cowboys by the name of Ennis Del Mar (A shockingly superb Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) meet at a ranch in Montana. Amidst the vast nowhere of the rocky mountains, these two form a strong relationship, that develops into an affair. However, this new found love is one that neither man is prepared to comprehend straight away. One drunken night of passion, leads to both men barely able to look at each other in the morning. How did this happen? They both reckon they're not homosexual. ""I ain't queer"" Ennis proclaims, somewhat fretfully to Jack. ""Neither am I"" retorts Jack. As far as these two men are concerned, what happens on the mountain, stays on the mountain. And so the affair continues, much to the chagrin of their disgusted boss (Played by Randy Quaid).As the years grow on, the two men appear to get on without each other. Both men get married, and even have children. But then one day they meet up again. And everything is compromised. Jack, ever the optimist, wants them to leave their wives and live together. Ennis, the realist, however, knows that an unforgiving society, especially in such a masculine environment, would never accept them together. So their secret affair continues, under the nose of their suspecting wives and friends.Brokeback Mountain may sound like an exploitation movie. Or indeed one about acceptance. But whilst it touches on these issues, it's really about something a lot more familiar in movies: Loss. Redemption. And Regret. It may be a western about homosexuality, and the taboo of it. But make no mistake. These are just two people who want to love each other. And that's the real tragedy of it. But that's not to say it is recurrent of films gone by. Far from it. Ang Lee has constructed a patient film, that deals with modern issues in a way that is much more reminiscent of Casablanca rather than the Rocky Horror Picture Show.If I have any criticism, it is that some people may find the film a tad too languid. Lee expects the audience to concentrate with this. You can put the Times' crossword puzzle away. Heath Ledger deserves an Oscar for his moody, subtle depiction of pent-up aggression. It is a fine, and very surprising performance from someone who is clearly destined for great things. Jake Gyllenhaal who in the past has done fantastic work, and has the label of the best actor of his generation is almost as great, with a brighter eyed performance.You will be touched and heartbroken, but will walk away glad. This is a film everyone should see.",Brokeback Mountain
229,Solnichka,What was all the fuss about?,6,1 October 2006,"The basis of this film is the relationship between two men, yet that relationship is not developed thoroughly at all. They spend a few nights together in the lonely mountains whole herding sheep. But why? Do they have some special bond? Barely. Do they share stories of their commonalities? Not really. One of them is drunk and cold, and lo and behold, he's now naked in the tent. If this was a movie about heterosexuals, it would be boring.The scenery is beautiful, and the film does a better job at developing the relationship later as life goes on, but the core of the story -- the beginning -- is really lacking in development. Pretty scenery and artistic film-making can only make up for so much lack of plot development. Considering it was drawn out from a short story, this is probably one of the difficulties in screen writing.This film would be much more realistic if the relationship was actually based on something tangible, but it's not. At the end, you do feel some pain for one of the main characters, so the movie does a decent job of bringing its audience into the characters' lives. But it could have been much better than it was, and a lot of people seem to be overlooking that fact.",Brokeback Mountain

231,RCWjr,"Good, not the ""Best Picture"" some would have us believe",8,14 April 2006,"This film is a good film, no question about it. However, I think because of the subject matter, it is elevated to a level it never really attains on its own.The performances are really good. Maybe too good. I'm not sure how the Jack character is portrayed in the book, but I found the character to be selfish and sniffling. I really had a hard time feeling any sort of empathy for the relationship as a whole. I did have empathy toward Ennis. His struggle to remain loyal to both of his relationships was far more compelling than Jack's constant moaning and groaning. The total disregard for his own family and Ennis' hurt the overall relationship in my opinion.The film does tread the line I feared it would. There is a sense that the story wants you to believe that all cowboys have closeted homosexual feelings. Though it borders on this, Lee knows better than to try and push that and pulls back just enough to save it. My biggest fear was the relationship would be presented as common place just so as to validate it. It came close, but as I said, stopped just short of that.Overall, a good film with very good performances and beautiful shots of America's grasslands.",Brokeback Mountain
232,FilmSnobby,"Gus and Call, 100 years later.",3,7 January 2006,"I found this movie to be over-hyped, but I'm nonetheless glad that it was made, as it is truly a landmark film that NEEDED to be made for the mainstream American audience. The movies have been demonstrably successful at raising social consciousness on a variety of issues, and consciousness-raising is clearly called for on the subject of homosexuality in the United States in 2006. *Brokeback Mountain* is a landmark film because it is, as far as I can tell, the first mainstream Hollywood gay romance, starring two hot new A-list stars -- Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal -- who happen to be heterosexuals. (As I said in another of my reviews, advances in civilization are always more recent than we think. This one's happening right now.) All this is fine and dandy, but, as with almost all ""landmark"" films, *Brokeback Mountain* announces itself as a future historical artifact (today, who watches *Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?* out of anything more than historical curiosity?), is weighed down by its own self-importance, and finally cannot avoid preaching at us. The solemnity here gets tedious very quickly. Whenever one of the characters makes a wisecrack, the audience laughs gratefully, being hungry for some amelioration for the self-seriousness that hangs over the movie like a dark cloud. Love can be tragic, of course, but even Shakespeare provided ""Romeo and Juliet"" with plenty of comic relief.The movie is NOT about ""gay cowboys""; these guys actually begin as gay shepherds. Screenwriter Larry McMurtry, writer of ""Lonesome Dove"" (among other Westerns of both 19th- and 20th century vintage), knows that the presence of sheep in a Western setting is always an elegiac sign of encroaching civilization. In other words, sheep means that the old macho ways are dying out. I've not read the Annie Proulx novella on which the movie is based, and therefore can't judge her understanding of this milieu, but McMurtry certainly hammers home the deliberately non-tough symbolism: the boys herd untold thousands of sheep during the first portion of the movie. I suppose this is fitting, but like everything else about the movie, it's also heavy-handed. The story is set largely in Wyoming during the Sixties and Seventies: Proulx, who wrote the story before the grisly murder of Matthew Shepherd (that word again!), was certainly on to something with her subject. But McMurtry feels that he must include a couple of scenes of homophobic violence, in case we missed the point.Meanwhile, McMurtry has trouble constructing a decent narrative out of such episodic material. The first portion sort of meanders, much like the sheep, until the boys finally get on with it . . . and then, the movie can only sort of hop around the next two decades, quite often dwelling on matters of ancillary interest. Do we really need to see Ennis beat up a couple of bikers who are behaving like skunks at the local 4th of July picnic? (Is this supposed to prove he's really not ""queer""?) Or watch Jack sell tractors down in Texas? I suppose the filmmakers are trying to provide a wider context to the love affair, but they spend far too much time doing it. For a love story that implicitly trumpets its own boldness, Ennis and Jack spend remarkably little time on screen together after their first job. We catch glimpses of them trysting at their Brokeback Mountain hideaway, gradually getting grayer and paunchier and generally less sexual. I was oddly, or perhaps not so oddly, reminded of *Same Time, Next Year*, just without the fairly interesting conversations between Alda and Burstyn.I was also reminded of McMurtry's own ""Lonesome Dove"", of which this film seems little more than a rewrite tailor-made for one of the pressing issues of the moment. Gyllenhaal is Jack/Gus, and Ledger is Ennis/Call. Amazingly, the corresponding character to McMurtry's Western novel dies as well, and, yes, wants to be buried in the place where he found the most happiness in life, which leaves the other character to mull over how he can fulfill his friend's final wish. Oh well, I suppose it IS clever that McMurtry rewrote his most famous characters -- macho as you could please -- as 20th century homosexuals.All that director Ang Lee can do with this formless, yet grievously ""important"", material, is film it beautifully, which he majestically does, taking full advantage of the natural beauty of southern Alberta (standing in for Wyoming). I was grateful for that, and for the uniformly excellent performances from the four principals (Ledger and Gyllenhaal, along with Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway as the long-suffering wives). But as much as I enjoyed the notion of the movies' first gay love affair for mainstream audiences being set in Wyoming -- Dick Cheney's home state -- I found *Brokeback Mountain* itself to be poorly executed.3 stars out of 10 for cinephiles of EITHER sexual persuasion; more stars for whom this sort of thing is a revelation.

I wait until all the hubbub dies down and after time if the film is still being discussed and seems to have a real lasting effect in peoples' minds then I rent it (sometimes I buy it if my instincts tell me to). Just this week I found a copy of 'Brokeback Mountain' in my late mothers' DVD drawer. Was I surprised!? Yes. This movie was on my short list of 'must sees' sooner rather than later. So I watched it and have to agree completely with all the raves of the past 4 years since its initial release. Heath Ledger is great in this film. His mumbling, shy yet tough Ennis is a multi-faceted, subtle and deeply moving performance. Jake Gyllenhaal's Jack is less faceted but then his character knows what he wants, at least more than Ennis does, at first. There is less room in the role for Gyllenhaal to grow as a character which is mostly set from the start. Even more impressive than the leading men are the leading women. Michelle Williams gives a very nuanced and lived-in performance of Ennis's wife, Alma. And Anne Hathaway's Lureen Newsome is also superb as the more controlled and worldly Mrs Jack Twist.The actress playing the 19 year-old Alma jnr, whose name I can't remember at the moment, stands out as well in a very strong cast.Music, cinematography, editing... everything, about this film qualifies it as one of the icons of great film-making in the United States. I'm glad I waited to see it without all the pop hype rolling around in my head.",Brokeback Mountain
234,Blade_Le_Flambeur,Strong performances and solid direction are ultimately dogged by a weak screenplay,7,6 January 2006,"'Brokeback Mountain' is a love parable set over twenty years, focusing on two men as they yearn for each other. The film has picked up a strong amount of steam and is likely to win at least one major Academy Award. The film features, undeniably, extremely strong performances along with some nicely done technical awards. It is in the screenplay and story that it falls apart.Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) is a quiet cowboy from Wyoming who is looking to get some money for a job watching over sheep. Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a gregarious, youthful man from Texas who wants the same job. At first the two just drink a beer together then go up to the mountains. As they quietly observe the scenery of Brokeback Mountain they slowly unravel their lives to one another - only to have a sudden sexual experience that neither of them can understand. The men can not deny or accept their passion for one another and once the job is done Del Mar goes off and marries his sweetheart Alma (Michelle Williams). Twist goes back to rodeo and there picks up the dashing and wealthy Lureen (Anne Hathaway). The two eventually settle down and start families until one day Del Mar receives a letter from Twist, reminding him of their passion. They each make excuses that they are ""fishing buddies"" while they go up to the mountains to share the passion amongst themselves. Things go awry as the two men are heartbroken over the fact that they can never be together even though they crave it so. An interesting idea, but one that unfortunately doesn't work out as best as possible.'Brokeback Mountain' is based on a short story by E. Annie Proulx. Short is the key word here. The screenplay by Larry McCurthy and Diane Ossana feels stretched out. The film covers the personal tales of these two men over a span of twenty years as they fade in and out of bitter relationships and fight with those around them. The film feels like a replay of everything - running at 2 hours and 15 minutes it's not exactly short. The problem is that after a certain period of time the audience understands that these two men will never be together, even though Twist may come up with an idealistic future. The photography of the mountains is well done by master Rodrigo Prieto ('25th Hour', 'Alexander') although it seems the imagery of the mountains does most of the work. The film has a melody to it's visual technique but that's not enough to save the flawed script that overreaches. This is not to say there aren't any positive elements to the film.The performances are nothing short of great. Ledger gives a strong, somber performance as a man who has dirt because he doesn't know how to get what he wants. Also sublime is Williams as the tormented wife who loves her husband but only wants him to love her back. Similarly impressive are the other two cast members. Lee, as a director, has established himself already. Here here adds to his filmography, providing a subtle view to the story. His ability to get strong performances out of his lead actors is unfaltering, as is his ability to tell a story about outsiders.'Brokeback Mountain' is interesting. It's a slow, quiet film that takes it's time. But what exactly is the right amount of time? With some strong performances, neat technical details, and solid direction 'Brokeback Mountain' had a recipe for something better... too bad it didn't quite take it.7/10",Brokeback Mountain

Life is too short, nothing, absolutely nothing, is more important than experiencing this kind of passionate, loving relationship shown in this mind boggling movie! I thank the author, screenwriters, producer, director and the actors for all sharing their genius, passion and greatness with the rest of us! You have changed my life forever!",Brokeback Mountain
236,GMJames,Taking two lives in context,10,7 January 2006,"Describing ""Brokeback Mountain"" as ""that gay cowboy movie"" is simplistic and condescending. When talking about male/male and male/female relationships, this has much more depth than a lot of other movies. I think director Ang Lee and screenwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana knew that they had a great project in adapting author Annie Proulx's short story to the big screen.Sometimes you can tell if actors are not totally invested in their roles especially if the script is weak. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal convinced me that they were Ennis and Jack. Both actors give their best performances to date.A good film can be an even great film if you have a strong supporting cast and ""Brokeback"" is no exception. They include Randy Quaid as the ranch owner who first hired Ennis and Jack, Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway as the wives of Ennis and Jack respectively, Linda Cardellini as the waitress Ennis meets after his divorce and Kate Mara as Ennis' eldest daughter. Also, Roberta Maxwell's brief scenes as Jack's mother were very memorable. (On a side note, the last short story that I thought was adapted brilliantly to the big screen was Stephen King's ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" which became ""The Shawshank Redemption"". Is it a coincidence that Thomas Newman's music from ""Shawshank"" is being used for the TV ads and the trailers for ""Brokeback""?) It may take more than just one viewing to see if a film holds up to close scrutiny. With ""Brokeback"" receiving so much buzz and controversy, that scrutiny will continue. It's been about a few days since watching ""Brokeback"" and I'm convinced that it should be called an instant classic.",Brokeback Mountain
237,broadfoot,Overrated,6,17 February 2006,"While I think ""Brokeback Mountain"" was well-acted and directed, it's probably one of the most over-hyped movies of 2005. The subject matter could have been handled in a more delicate manner. For example, the opening sex scene in the tent between Heath Ledger and Jake Gylenhaal could have been displayed with a shot of the tent exterior and the camera slowly drawing back from the tent while the audience hears the sounds of sex coming from inside the tent. Today, however, Hollywood feels that everything involving a sexual and violent nature must be displayed graphically.I cannot feel any sympathy for Ledger's character. Not only does he feel it is appropriate for him and Gylenhaal to publicly display their homosexuality in front of Ledger's wife and children, but whenever he and Gylenhaal experience a disturbance in their relationship, he responds by berating his wife and threatening her with a beating.To me, this is just another gay-friendly movie with a twist. If it wins for Best Picture at the Oscars, it will prove that enough audiences and critics have been fooled yet again by the ""Hollywood Hype"".",Brokeback Mountain
238,drpakmanrains,Overrated Dull Film Would Be Deadly If Not For Gay Theme.,5,2 April 2012,"It fascinates me that most of the user reviews of this film were 8 or above, while its competitor, Crash, were mostly 1 or 2 for pages at a time, yet user ratings were higher for Crash. Well I, for one, thoroughly enjoyed Crash and felt it richly deserved the Oscar, while this film seemed dull and flat, with only the scene where the wife saw her husband kissing his male lover having much power. The big love scene in the tent was hard to see and looked more like a fight in the poor light. There was not much chemistry between Heath and Jake, and they never convinced me they were in love, other than the dialog in the second half. I sincerely believe that if this film were about a heterosexual love triangle, it would have died and been trashed by critics. I have about 10 gay themed films in my 500+ DVD collection, all better than this. For example, Save Me, You Are Not Alone, A Very Serious Person, Summer Storm, and A whole New Thing. Many think this film would have won the Oscar were it not for the gay issue. I think it was the only thing that made it noteworthy, and for me, it was a disappointing film at that.",Brokeback Mountain
239,clydestuff,Excellent film about wanting to love and be loved in a world unwilling to accept it,10,9 February 2006,"One does not head out to see Brokeback Mountain without having a general idea of what the film is about. Unless you've had your head buried in a cocoon, you know that Brokeback Mountain is the Gay Cowboy Movie which has received one award after another as the best picture of 2005. Are the accolades more the result of its controversial subject matter or is it really that good? I can say unequivocally that Brokeback Mountain is much more than just a gay cowboy love story. Yes, it is a love story, but it is also about the heartache, the heartbreak, the guilt and the shame forced upon those who through no fault of their own, love and cherish someone of their own gender and are unable to acknowledge that love openly and honestly because of the rigid codes forced upon them by society. It is in every aspect an excellent film.A ranch hand, Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) meets rodeo cowboy Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) while working as sheep herders in the mountains of Wyoming during the summer of 1963. During their time together they fall in love and have sex. Yet, it is a love that is never acknowledged between them as being such. It is as Ennis puts it, ""one-shot deal going on."" ""You know I ain't queer,"" he tells Jack just to make sure he understands.Jack's reply, ""Neither am I."" One need look no further then when Ennis relates how his father took him to view the corpse of a gay man who was tortured and then beaten to death, to understand the consequences of not only being gay in 1963 but being discovered. It's a story that casts a dark shadow over the rest of the film. Both men do what they can to fit in. They marry and have children. With Ennis, it is a way to prove that his summer on Brokeback was just a one shot deal, with Jack it is a marriage of convenience.It is under this ominous cloud that these men must find a way to share their love, in whatever way possible and still try to fit into what society views as being normal. Jack knows he is gay without admitting it. We experience their joy when they are together. We feel their loneliness when they are apart. When four years have passed since their summer on the mountain, Ennis anxiously awaits a first visit by Jack. He chain smokes and chugs on beer trying to stay calm, unable to hide his feelings. It is also the first time that his wife, Alma (Michelle Williams), begins to realize there is more to the relationship than meets the eye.Ang Lee's direction of this film is beyond reproach. It would have been tempting for some directors to exploit the subject matter and hammer us over the head with it. Lee keeps the focus on a very personal level, never letting the story stray or go off on a tangent. The cast is as superb as the direction. I have seen Heath Ledger in several films, most of them instantly forgettable so I was totally unprepared and shocked by the depth of emotion he brings to Ennis here. And he does it not by being over the top, but with a great deal of subtlety and nuance. Ennis is a man of few words, but Ledger tells us everything we need to know about him without a tremendous amount of dialog.Gyllenhaal is every bit as good as Jack Twist. Jack Twist is a man of many words, but he is also a man who never gives up on his dream of someday living the life he wants to, and sharing it with the person he loves the most.In supporting roles, both Michelle Williams as Alma and Anne Hathaway as Jack's wife Lureen are excellent also. We suspect that Lureen's marriage to Jack is as much a marriage of convenience for her as it is for him. She doesn't have much screen time, but she makes the most of it. If her roles in the straight to DVD film Havoc and Brokeback are any indication, her days of being thought of as the Princess in the Princess Diaries films will soon be forgotten. Regrettably, I had not seen any of Michelle Williams work before Brokeback but I wish I had. She is very deserving of her Academy Award nomination for her work here.Of course, there will always be those who say that much of the recognition Brokeback is receiving has more to do with its subject matter than with the quality of the film itself. Nothing could be more wrong. Yes, the subject matter may be controversial to some, but the truth is there is there is no reason why it should be. Although things have changed quite a bit since 1963 there are still way too many who fear gays as if they were the devil, the bogeyman, and should all carry the last name of Nasty as Alma calls Jack at one point. In the week before I saw Brokeback Mountain, a man walked into a gay bar in Massachusetts and began assaulting the patrons with a hatchet and a gun. In Roanoke Virginia five years ago, Ronald Edward Gay walked into the Backstreet Café and began shooting, simply because he wanted to kill homosexuals. If the day ever comes, and whether or not it is in my lifetime, that a person can love someone of their own gender and walk through a mall, a parking lot, or an amusement park hand in hand without receiving so much as a glance, then Brokeback Mountain may no longer be controversial. But it'll still be a great film, and when you're a great film you know I have no choice but to give you an overwhelming A+.",Brokeback Mountain
240,kylehodgdon,Lots Of Emotion And Depression,6,16 January 2010,"This movie turned out to be quite a bit better than I thought it was going to be. When it began, and for the first twenty-five minutes afterward, I thought that this was going to be just a movie about Ennis and Jake having troubles herding sheep together and being gay. That would have been incredibly boring. To my surprise and joy, it changed after the first half hour and the story really picked up.The way that this movie showed the characters emotions was very nicely done. Above anything else, that is probably this film's greatest achievement. To say that the closing of this movie is sad is a gross understatement. Even more than the closing of it actually, a large percentage of this is very depressing. Neither one of the main characters (or supporting characters, for that matter) are happy in this film. This movie is so depressing at times that it turns into something that I would rather not be watching. I am very glad I saw this movie to understand what all the buzz was about, and it was much better than I was expecting. If you feel up for a depressing kind of movie, this is a pretty good one with a lot of character emotion shown.",Brokeback Mountain
241,howie73,Cannot reach the heights....,5,10 April 2006,"I'm glad the Academy went against critical opinion in its rejection of Brokeback Mountain for best picture Oscar. Ang Lee's uninvolved ""gay"" cowboy film has been overrated by many critics who should have know better. Based on a short novel by Anne Proulx, heterosexual director Ang Lee has mangled a one-note symphony out of a threadbare and inconsistent story. And therein lies the problem. There is simply not enough material to fill over 2 hours. Had Lee demanded a better edit he might have saved this film; yet what we get is mangled, self-consciously dire exploration of gay love amongst men who ""ain't queer"". It feels like an upmarket Lifetime TV movie minus the cheesy soundtrack. The acting is also sub-par. Heath Ledger as Ennis needs elocution lessons (as does Gyllenhaal's Jack Twist) who seems to be chewing tobacco throughout this film. It's virtually impossible to decipher what they are saying. I think this film needs subtitles. In addition, each lead cowboy cannot elicit our sympathy. Both are selfish and self-contradictory to the degree that any sympathy on the audience's behalf is lost. Ledger's Ennis is so tortured that he cannot express any emotion when he needs to; yet he openly kisses Gyllenhall when he visits  a scene so unconvincing and overdone that it wouldn't go amiss in any weekday soap-opera. This is a pity. The film needed an emotional core built around its leads but fails to provide that. The wives are equally unsympathetic, so much so that we don't even feel sorry for them  especially Hathway's character who is married to Jack. However there are good elements here. The cinematography is excellent in the first thirty minutes and towards the end; yet that alone cannot save one of the most depressing and overrated films of recent memory. Thank God the Academy saw sense. For once I applaud their judgment.",Brokeback Mountain
242,pyotr-3,Must be seen twice,10,17 December 2005,"Possibly the greatest film I have ever seen. Period.I didn't think it possible that anyone could beat Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Truman Capote this year, but by golly Heath Ledger DID it. His portrayal of ranch hand Ennis Del Mar is the most real thing I have ever seen. I will go even further: every actor who performs for even a second in this film is absolute perfection. It could not have been better acted or put together.Ang Lee has proved that he is a genius with this film. If he does not win the Oscar for Best Director, I will know that something is rotten in Denmark. His work here was simply unbeatable. Unsurpassable.I recommend reading the story as well as seeing the movie, and I recommend seeing the movie at least twice. Ang Lee has packed every moment with so much, that I do think it is essential to see it more than once to FULLY appreciate all that this film has to offer.Many men have written to author Annie Proulx to tell her ""You have told my story."" It is a true-life western story that is way past due being told. It is the real life story of many ranch hands, cowboys, and farmers, and it is a shame that the world is only now seeing and hearing their story. I have never been a cowboy, yet it mirrored my own life to an amazing degree nonetheless. I could relate 100% with every single frame... at times I did feel as though my own story was being told, even though my story took place in the southeast rather than the West.See this film. It will be a historical landmark film for the ages.",Brokeback Mountain
243,marissas75,Oustanding blend of the classic and the modern,10,13 December 2005,"""Brokeback Mountain"" combines high-quality film-making technique and universally resonant emotions with subject matter that some people still find discomforting or taboo, for an outstanding movie that feels both classic and modern at the same time.The first part of the film deals with a summer spent by two young sheepherders, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, on Brokeback Mountain, where their relationship goes from friendship to copulation to a love that they can scarcely believe is real. After this idyll, the film follows these characters for the next twenty years as they marry, have children, and pursue their love in secret. It's a succession of heart-wrenching emotional moments, each more painful than the next. But, amazingly, the film is never noisy, bombastic, or sappy. The film's quartet of young actors all do wonderful work. Heath Ledger is astonishing as Ennishe takes the stereotype of the taciturn, stoic ""Western"" hero, forces this iconic character to confront a range of new emotions, and does it all without a hint of mockery. He makes an archetype believable again. As Jack, Jake Gyllenhaal is a great foil to Ledgermore exuberant and more hungry than he. Michelle Williams makes Ennis's wife, Alma, into a sympathetic, quietly tragic figure, and Anne Hathaway is a lot of fun as Jack's wife Lureen.I heard that the director and producer decided that women were the target audience for this movie, according to the logic that ""it's a love story, and they're cute!"" But because the ""love story"" part of that statement is so true, the ""they're cute"" part gets negated. When watching certain romantic movies that star good-looking actors, you start to fantasize that it's you in the movie, kissing the handsome guy (or beautiful gal), in place of his or her co-star. This is fun, but it also means that the movie is mediocresuch fantasies take you outside of the world that the movie is trying to create. Daydreaming that you have replaced one of the actors means the romantic relationship was so weak and unpersuasive that you think you'd make a better romantic lead than the actual character in the film. But in a truly romantic movie, you believe so strongly that the two characters are meant to be together that you wouldn't dream of replacing one of them with yourself. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is such a film. Who on earth could break up Jack and Ennis' lovea love that persists in the face of so many obstacles, a love that they themselves cannot end? It would be sordid even to try.So, women: go see ""Brokeback Mountain."" Get your heart broken half-a-dozen times by all its emotion-filled moments. Be astounded by the performances of Ledger, Gyllenhaal, Williams, and Hathaway. Just don't go expecting to spend two hours fantasizing about a handsome actor or two. This film's rewards are different, and greater. Any mediocre movie can make you fall in love with a cute leading actor. But ""Brokeback Mountain"" has the rare quality of making you fall in love with two characters, Jack and Ennis, and the love between them.",Brokeback Mountain
244,lostintwinpeaks,"Beautiful, intelligent and thought-provoking.",10,4 March 2006,"After failing with the well-intentioned but risible The Hulk, Ang Lee (not his first time directing a film with a gay romance  see also 1993's The Wedding Banquet) returns with one of his best films to date, a poignant and beautiful adaptation of E. Annie Proulx's short story, Brokeback Mountain.Charting the twenty-year love affair of two men, the film features brilliant direction, stunning cinematography, a beautiful authentic-feeling score, and a dignified and well-written screenplay (courtesy of novelist Larry McMurtry and writing partner Diana Ossana) that judiciously adapts Proulx's story.The film is also filled with superb performances from all its cast. Heath Ledger in particular gives a stunning performance. Initially I thought his portrayal was a bit too stiff and teeth clenching but, as the movie progresses, you realize it is the perfect portrayal of his character, Ennis del Mar. Ledger really grows into his character and gives method acting a grace and dignity reminiscent of Montgomery Clift. Co-star Jake Gyllenhaal also gives a fine performance, though unfortunately he will be overshadowed by Ledger: it's understandable, as the movie concentrates more on Ennis del Mar than Gyllenhaal Jack Twist, but Gyllenhaal is a talented young actor who gives a marvelous performance.Both main stars are well supported by Michelle Williams (as excellent as she was in another gay-themed film, HBO's If These Walls Could Talk 2) and Anne Hathaway (giving surprising depth that you would not expect from the star of such films as Ella Enchanted and The Princess Diaries).The film plays beautifully, never sensationalizing its so-called 'controversial' topic (really, in 2006?) and all the cast and crew display an obvious respect and passion for the subject.If there are any low points, they are few - such as the cast is very young (not only the main leads but Hathaway and Williams in particular look too young) which stretches credibility as the twenty years slowly pass. However their fine performances just about make up for this and the filmmakers wisely didn't overdo the aging make-up (in fact they keep it to a bare minimum: young cast members playing much older characters can be hard to believe, but particularly so when they are obviously heavily made-up to look older!).There's very little else to fault in this wonderful movie, though perhaps the passion between the two main characters could have been slightly steamier  you do get the feeling the producers were treading carefully; then again, had they steamed things up, maybe it would have felt too vociferous and controversy courting.As things stand, this is a tender and heartbreaking masterpiece and one of the most beautiful films to come out of America in recent months. Though the film thugs wonderfully at your heartstrings, it never comes close to being one of those awful 'weepies' like Love Story.Hopefully, the controversy surrounding this movie will stop. It's unnecessary at this point in time. This film deserves to be viewed, enjoyed and cherished on its own right, as a beautiful tale of a love affair repressed and hidden out of fear of society's reaction.Brokeback Mountain is an intelligent and thought-provoking film that deserves to win all the Oscars it's nominated for. I truly hope it does.",Brokeback Mountain

Tastefully done, it will surprise those who think they are going to see hardcore scenes, because there are none. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway give splendid support but the film belongs to the two Leading Men who are brilliant actors.

It is a good movie, with fine performances, a thoughtful script, and involving direction; however, it is probably not a great movie, or the year's best film, or a milestone in the history of cinema. This fact will not prevent many from viewing it that way. That's fine.I subscribe to James Berardinelli's view of the film: that audiences, in an effort to rebuff the hateful words of some right-wingers, have over-hyped ""Brokeback Mountain"", making something beyond what it is. It is a good movie, however, and I recommend it to anyone with an interest in these kinds of tragic stories. Michelle Williams should be singled out for her especially good work, and Linda Cardellini is great in a small role.",Brokeback Mountain
247,bjones,Brave new cinema...,10,30 January 2006,"After waiting for what seemed like forever for the film to come to our fly-blown sand-speck of a town I finally gave up and made a two hour drive over a mountain ridge in disgust just to see it. Other than the considerable hyperbole and the meager trailers I had nothing to go on. As a result, I had more than a few expectations upon purchasing my ticket. Would a film about gay cowboys be worth the trouble? Overall, I have to comment first that I was most pleased right away by the Cinematography of Rodrigo Prieto. He made a film that was beautiful to watch. Unfortunately, it looked a lot more like Canada than Wyoming - both places I've been to a lot. Still, I love the mountains and some scenes reminded me of places I had been camping or hunting as a boy, so I liked it anyway. In fact, so much of it reminded me of my childhood - absent a long shopping list of abusive, alcoholic cowboys - that it gave me a definite feeling of discomfort in places.The next thing to notice is that most of the screen time seems to be occupied by Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar and Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist. So much is demanded of their talents it's hard to imagine the pressure they must have felt to pull it off, even with all the support they had behind them. The sheer weight of the controversy they both must have felt in even taking the roles, and their resultant success or lack thereof, may effect film making for a long time to come. In any event, I would personally thank them both for their obvious courage in stepping forward to take these very difficult and controversial roles. I hope they know that regardless of whether or not they garner future awards for their efforts, millions of people will be touched and their lives enriched by witnessing their performances here.For me, being a westerner who grew up in the shadow of huge, majestic mountain ranges, I oddly felt myself want to be negative about Ledger's performance. After all, why couldn't they find an authentic American to play the part, I asked myself? Well, I have to say that Ledger found a character within him that genuinely reminded me of people I have known. How far this is from his real persona can only be guessed at, but he certainly didn't do any injustice to the real type of person he played. For his part, Gyllenhaal didn't disappoint either (although it was a bit harder to buy both as they ""aged"" on-screen). Their portrayal of their happenstance meeting and subsequent attraction that grew over their first summer together into a life-long secret life and even more secret love-affair is the central theme of the film. The lost and lonely gay men they portrayed, trying to make their way in a society that was, and to some extent remains, a highly dangerous one to gays, were both touching and heart-breaking to witness. The pseudo success of Gyllenhaal's character's ""hetero"" life gave a stark comparison to the lonely semi-reclusiveness of Ledger's circumstances and, doubtless, both are true enough to reality, but both were equally tragic in that they were denied the full happiness that life could have given them. I enjoyed both performances a lot although their characterizations were quite different. At the end I felt both wonderfully fleshed out their roles and gave honor, dignity and grace to what they brought to the screen and I will long remember them. The end result was a story of two humans who just plainly loved each other and could never find a place to just be alive and truthful to themselves. Neither Romeo and Juliet or Tristan & Isolde have anything on these men, as theirs is a story that ultimately feels much more real, believable and tragic. Even as I write this, there are but very few places in the world that would not shun or condemn them for just being alive.A pivotal element of the film were the scattering of other characters around the central stars, giving a sense of completeness, ""fleshing"" out their lives. I especially enjoyed both Michelle Williams as Alma, Ledger's wife, and the wonderful Anne Hathaway as Lureen, Gyllenhaal's wife. This was quite a departure for Hathaway from the sort of usual characters she's played, but her's was a great counterpoint to Gyllenhaal's. Both of these ladies reminded me of women I've known, so I felt they added more reality to the overall presentation. Other's who truly added substance to the film, for me, were Graham Beckel, as Lureen's father; Randy Quaid as Joe Aguirre; Linda Cardellini as Cassie; Kate Mara as Alma Jr. and Roberta Maxwell as Jack's mother (her's was a real gem too). In fact, I think I have loved both Cardellini and Hathaway in everything I've seen them in.All-in-all, it was a great movie, extremely well made and very entertaining, well worth the trouble - and long drive - I went through to see it. The remainder of the crew who brought this to the screen should all be commended for a superlative job, but in the final analysis, I think the impact of this film will be one of being remembered more for it's socio-political statement more than it's cinematic quality.On the eve of the announcements for the academy awards, I feel it's a shoe-in to get many nominations and should deservedly win some. I like it better than some of the other possible contenders for Best Picture, Cinematography and certainly enjoyed the performances enough to hope that at least Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams get a nod for acting. Good luck to them.",Brokeback Mountain
248,joker-4,A short story that should have been treated as a short film.,6,16 March 2006,"Let's not look at BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN as the ""gay cowboy"" movie or as ""the film that should have won the Best Picture Oscar."" Let's avoid the clichés that cinema as an art form reflects the political nature of society and let's definitely not tiptoe around the assumedly politically-correct stance that the homosexual community needs to rally around this film and treat it as a benchmark. Instead, let's look at BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN as a film, something many reviewers (and fans) refuse to do.From its opening scene of a lonely pre-dawn road through the entire first act filled with Canadian majesty masquerading as the purple mountains of Wyoming, film auteur Ang Lee tries his best to illustrate the solitary life that a sheep-herder must certainly face. This solidarity continues its theme as Ennis and Jack learn that they are a definite minority and how their lifestyle affects other choices they must deal with.BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN possess a number of fine and memorable scenes, most of which occur in the following two acts where Ennis and Jack, apart from each other, do their best to simply live life. Lee's base camera-work coupled with beautifully-authentic looking sets helps capture these cinematic moments. Where BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN fails is its inability to place these individual moments into a cohesive and compelling film. Lee fails in glancing over this solitary cowboy life by providing nothing more than the quickest of glimpses. As a result, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN as a whole appears as nothing more than filler material padding a short story.The silent moments in a cowboy's life is a topic that has been illustrated in more compelling films than this. Kevin Costner's OPEN RANGE is perhaps the most current example. A handful of good scenes does not make a complete narrative and Ang Lee and James Schamus have partnered on better collaborations than this.Heath Ledger's Ennis is a one-dimensional rough and stoic cowboy of old whose press has surprisingly outshone that of Jake Gyllenhaal's work, whose character  and acting  is definitely the superior of the two. Not to slight Annie Proulx's magazine story, it appeared that Lee and Oscar-winning writing team of McMurty and Ossana failed to forget the basic premise of adapting a single short story into a full-length feature. Great scenes become highly memorable but without a cohesive story combing such scenes into a greater sum results in an unimpressive product.",Brokeback Mountain
249,Balthazar-5,A profound disappointment,6,12 January 2006,"Ang Lee is one of a triumvirate (with Hsiao-hsien Hou, and Edward Yang) of Chinese directors who are among contemporary cinema's greatest assets. I have loved most of his previous films to exasperation, and so it was with great - perhaps too much - expectation that I ventured into 'Brokeback Mountain'. Let me emphasise that I have not read anything by Annie Proulx, but it doesn't matter. Films, no matter what their origins, have to stand by what is on the screen, and what is on this particular screen is, in my opinion, fatally flawed by careless cinematic expression. The two central characters are noticeably and understandably inarticulate. Their outdoor lifestyles are the total inverse of those of the chattering classes that inhabit, for example, the world of Woody Allen. But in the cinema, there is a rule that says if your characters are inarticulate, then it is up to the director to give them 'visual articulateness'. If they cannot express their feelings in words, then we must be given visual pointers to their feelings. In 'The Ice Storm' - Ang Lee's masterpiece, in my opinion, this principle is adhered to with wonderful results. But here, we get grunts and manly gestures that suggest nothing. The 'bond' which ties them together as they part does not express any emotional need - they do not dream or daydream of each other, sexually or otherwise, as far as we are shown. The scene at the end of their summer on the mountain is a complete cop-out, we need to feel what they feel, and we are not invited to feel anything. Why is this film attracting so much attention (compared with Lee's better early work)? I fear it is because a film embracing gay modern cowboys is thought to be on the brave side of risqué. Perhaps it will help us gain tolerance or some such desirable attribute. But it isn't cinema.",Brokeback Mountain
250,DannyBoy-17,"Brave film-making, but over-hyped",7,3 January 2006,"I guess there had been enough built up about Brokeback Mountain as a great expression of the purity of love that I was really thinking ""Best Picture"" material as I went in to see it. So, my expectations were high: they weren't met.For one thing, the plot seems to get lost about 3/4 of the way through the film. Especially once Jack is gone, I began thinking that the plot had lost its focus, and I was just waiting for the ending. The performances are worthwhile though, especially Ledger who seems to arrive already burdened or repressed even as the film just starts. Actually, it reminded me of Billy Bob Thornton's performance in Sling Blade, and suddenly I remembered how excellently Ledger had played Thornton's son in ""Monster's Ball.""However, the thing about Brokeback Mountain is it's not a great film: it's a well-made film about a subject almost no one is willing to tackle, men on the DL. Men carrying on homosexual affairs within the confines of marriage and family, not because they want to, but because they believe society's reaction to the truth would be so brutal that they'd be in fear for their lives.This was the 60s-70s, and to some degree, the fears these men have could still exist today. I wonder how much things have changed; are cases like Matthew Shepard rare anomalies or are they the kind of thing that could happen to many men who came out openly and refused the confines of marriage?I read one Christian site review that said the film was artistically made but still seemed to condone these men's choosing of homosexual relations, which they see as sinful. Still, it is what comes naturally to them, and as long as they hurt no one else in the process and mutually consent, then what is the harm? Why persecute them?In the end, the film is at times shocking, at times challenging, but overall more of a slow character study. Ledger is worth bearing with, seeming to always have layers to pull back of anger and passion. The film becomes remarkable not as a great work, but as a well-done film about a very difficult subject. ***.5",Brokeback Mountain
251,kitellis-98121,It never gets old.,10,12 July 2018,"I've watched this beautiful film many times, and it is still as good each time as I remembered it.It is epic, yet intimate; uplifting, yet tragic; heart-warming, yet heart-breaking. The landscapes are magnificent, but they are only the backdrop to a small, gentle story about love and loss, told in a quiet, simple way, with a script that is extraordinarily economical with words - more is said in the silences than in the dialogue.The performances too are understated and subtle, with not a single wasted look or gesture.I always need to be in the right mood for this film, as it is certainly not the most cheerful, but I do keep coming back to it. For me it has become a comfortable film to snuggle up to in the cold.",Brokeback Mountain
252,adamshl,Superb Classic,10,8 January 2008,"Years after seeing this film, I am still haunted by its beauty and perfection. Ang Lee really outdid himself in fashioning a realization of a lovely short story.The cast is uniformly excellent, the photography brilliant, and the score most moving. It ranks as one of the greatest films ever made, and goes down cinematic annals as a masterpiece.Though it may be unfair to make a comparison to the film that won Best Picture that year, ""Brokeback"" is a far superior work. I predict that years after the former will be forgotten, ""Brokeback"" will be revived again and again and rediscovered by future generations.",Brokeback Mountain
253,Monotreme02,"Touching, honest, tragic, beautiful",10,25 January 2006,"I find it hard to express in words just how this movie made me feel. Take this as less of a review and more of an expression of my impressions and feelings regarding the film.It is touching, and extremely emotional. It is raw, pure, and honest. Tragic, heart breaking. Beautiful. These are all words that describe this movie. I won't explain any of them, all I will say is, if you see the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about.This isn't a film for everyone. People whose favorite film from last year was Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, or King Kong (as good as they may be) will probably not like Brokeback Mountain. But people who can appreciate an honest, beautiful and tragic drama, which is slow and subtle but at the same time very complex, should go see this amazing triumph of film-making.My theory is that, besides the normal division into genres, films can also be divided into the following three categories: Plot-driven films, character-driven films and mood-driven films. Plot-driven films are those in which much happens, and the plots are intricate and complex. Most American movies fall into this category. Character-driven films are more rare, and are usually win lots of awards. Recent films such as The Hours, Sideways, 21 Grams, and others are intricate character studies, although plot-wise, nothing much happens in them. Nor is the plot at all important. The third category, mood films, can be found mostly in European or Far Eastern cinema. Ang Lee, whose roots are in Hong-Kong-based cinema, brings this Eastern subtlety and ability to create a very specific and strong feeling or mood in films and transfers it to his American films.Ang Lee is a director of subtlety. Sure, he has directed some bigger films, such as Hulk, but his masterpieces (Sense and Sensibility, The Ice Storm, Eat Drink Man Woman, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) are pieces of subtlety. Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon has its action scenes, but the movie expresses far more in the scenes in which nobody speaks than it does in the action scenes. Even the action scenes, while impressively choreographed, still express a sort of subtle, quiet, tranquil beauty, and are not bombastic or overbearing.Almost every aspect of Brokeback Mountain is very subtle, but all these aspects together create an elaborate and very powerful mood. The cinematography is very simplistic. The camera rarely ever moves, and there are no pompous or intricate shots. The shots take there time, too, but the vistas of the Wyoming mountains and lakes are just so beautiful, and the cinematography emphasizes these vistas with stunning and unsparing long shots. The musical score, played basically on a single guitar, is minimalist, but beautiful, and fits the mood of the film perfectly. The acting, too, is subtle, but flawless and quite amazing. Jake Gyllenhaal and Anne Hathaway give strong performances, but the two real stunners of the film are Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams, who plays his wife. Ledger's character is so intensely complex, and yet, he acts him with such subtlety. He flawlessly slips right into the part. It's a really, really powerful performance, and it coming from Heath Ledger, whose previous movies include mediocre ""teenage"" films such as ""A Knight's Tale"" and ""10 Things I Hate About You"", only adds more to its value. Michelle Williams gives yet another strong performance, expressing her characters emotions through her facial expressions alone, and not through talking or actions. The scene in which she snaps is haunting and tragic.The script, too, is very minimalist. As in Ang Lee's previous films, the true shining moments of Brokeback Mountain are those in which none of the characters speak. There really isn't that much dialogue in the film (although this is partly because of the nature of Heath Ledger's introvert, reclusive and mainly quiet character), which allows the film to express itself through the characters' emotions and feelings, and not through their actions or dialogue.To my dismay, this film is receiving some severe backlash due to its gay themes  themes that aren't even present in the movie. The film is not a ""gay cowboy"" movie  it even emphasizes the fact that both characters are heterosexuals. The movie, as its tag-line says, describes love as a ""force of nature""  it is an emotion so strong that once it grabs hold of you, it will never let you go. Although the film focuses on two very specific characters, its themes couldn't be more universal. Its message and themes could apply to any case of forbidden love  homosexual, inter-cultural, religious, and more.I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that Brokeback Mountain is a cinematic landmark. I think it is the best movie of 2005, and I will be very happy if it wins some major awards. It has already won quite a few  all of them very well deserved. I recommend this beautiful, flawless film to anyone and everyone  although viewers who are not used to slow-paced dramas probably won't benefit from the ultimate effect of this touching, emotional and tragic movie.",Brokeback Mountain
254,leilapostgrad,Austin Movie Show review -- greatest film to ever depict 2 men in love,10,18 December 2005,"Yes, absolutely! Brokeback Mountain deserves all the praise, hype, nominations, and awards it's receiving. It's so good that I just want to cry all over again. Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) meet as young men in 1963 Wyoming. They spend the summer as hired ranch-hands, taking care of a herd of sheep on Brokeback Mountain. One night, after having spent the day drinking an entire bottle of whiskey, the two fall asleep together in a tent. Jack reaches for Ennis hand and wraps it around his body. Ennis jumps up and tries to get out of the tent. Jack holds him back. In a moment of serious passion, without a word or even a kiss, the two end up having sex right then and there. And so beings their lifelong and doomed love affair.Undoubtedly, Brokeback Mountain is the greatest film ever made about a gay relationship. The morning after their first physical interaction, Ennis (the quiet one) says to Jack (the more out-going one), ""You know I ain't queer."" Jack replies, ""Neither am I."" This movie isn't about homosexuality or heterosexuality. It's about a painfully passionate  yet forbidden  love affair. But the summer ends, and both men go their separate ways, hardly saying a word to each other. Ennis gets married and starts having children, while Jack moves to Texas and marries a rich rodeo girl.Four years later, Jack contacts Ennis and tells him that he's coming up to Wyoming to visit. The two lovers pick-up exactly where they left off. Ennis tells his wife (Michelle Williams) that he and Jack are ""going fishing"" for a week up on Brokeback Mountain. For the next 20 years, Jack comes back two or three times a year, and the two ""go fishing"" for a week. Jack always wants more. Jack wants to get a ranch with Ennis and live together forever. Ennis keeps him at bay, warning him that their relationship could end up killing them both  literally.In 1960s and 70s Wyoming, it was impossible for two men to be openly in love and in a committed relationship. In most states in this country today, the same is still true, as more and more state legislatures pass Constitutional Amendments banning gay marriage. Jack and Ennis both end up alone because society never allowed them to be in love and be together.For more reviews, visit www.austinmovieshow.com.",Brokeback Mountain
255,Scoval71,Stupendous,10,2 March 2006,"At first, when the movie started, I simply could not figure out or master the speech patterns---the drawl--or maybe I am trying to say they were mumbling a lot and I,personally, could not understand the speech--it was really, at times, very inarticulate, and maybe the director should have picked up on this. However, after a while I got used to it, but there were many times I simply could not figure out or understand,maybe that is a better word, what they were saying-- a lot of mumbling. Aside from this, this movie was one of the best, well acted films I have ever seen in my life. I was so moved. You know when you see a movie and then something about it, something in it, moves or touches you, and it stays with you for the next day, you keep thinking and thinking about it---over and over again,well that is exactly what happened here. I applaud this movie and I just think it was truly wonderful. Wonderful. Poignant and powerful and it stands as a beacon, a lesson for all of us, gay or straight, to learn about how we must follow our heart as far as love is concerned. That and so much, much, much more. See this movie!!!",Brokeback Mountain
256,samuelding85,Heartbreak Mountain,9,24 February 2006,"Ang Lee turns the heartbreaking short story from Annie E. Prolux's Brokeback Mountain + Close Range into a heartbreaking drama that touches the heart of every man, with Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal as the heart breakers kept in the closet.It is really amazing for Ang Lee to turn a mere 55 pages short story into a 134min drama, of two cowboys who finds love among themselves during the period where they take care of a bunch of sheep in Brokeback Mountain. They found passion among each other and they shared their happiest moment together. Soon, their job comes to an end and they go separate ways.Both Ennis (Ledger) and Jack (Gyllenhaal)hide their feelings for one another during their respective marriage with Alma (Michelle Williams) and Lureen (Anne Hathaway). While Ennis is torn between his fidelity with Jack and Alma, Jack never seems to find satisfaction from Lureen, who has a well to do background. He finds fulfillment from the gigolos in Mexico, and that marks the threat to their relationship.Ang Lee is not selling homosexuality in Brokeback Mountain. More rather, he let us see how love can be powerful outside heterosexual context. Though i've not personally watched his previous homosexual-themed drama The Wedding Banquet, i could see that Brokeback is not your typical homosexual-themed drama or gay haha comedy, where a happy ending among a gay couple just simply passed off the whole film. It does not sell or glorifying homosexuality, but more rather, it reflects homosexuality and the pressure it faced during the 60's to the 80's. If Brokeback Mountain is just simply a gay drama that features nothing but endless gay sex, glorifying homosexuality through husband divorcing his wife and go live with another man, then Brokeback Mountain has failed terribly, and at the same time, defy Prolux's initial idea of penning down Brokeback Mountain. Compared to the novel, Ang Lee and his scriptwriter Larry McMurtry & Diana Ossana adds in more details to back up some points that surrounds the story, without destroying Prolux's idea. This further enhanced the film on the forbidden relationship that lasted for decades.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal shines in the film, with Ledger as the more reserved Ennis, who puts his family in his first place on top of his love of the more talkative, outgoing Jack. While Gyllenhall took the role of Jack, his appearance to continue his relationship with Ennis not only makes Alma cry and kept Lureen back in the dark, but also putting their relations at jeopardy. He questions himself on his fulfillment in love and lust on both Ennis and Lureen, which earns himself a nomination for Best Supporting Acotr in 2006 Acdamy Awards. Michelle William's breakthrough role of Alma earns her an nomination for Best Supporting Actress, where her helpless cries on Ennis fidelity with a man could not be heard. She finds an escape to that through constant overtime work, which eventually ends her marriage with Ennis. For her breakthrough role, she is putting herself onto the world map from her previous unknown roles in her earlier movies.The film breaks the heart of the audience, and breaking the mountain into pieces means they are making several award statues for themselves as well. Brokeback Mountain is one of the rare gems that could make such a remarkable achievements.",Brokeback Mountain
257,cdelacroix1,How Not to Tell A Tragic Love Story,5,15 January 2006,"Heath Ledger is just extraordinary as Ennis. He carried this role with such skill and authenticity. I really think he's one of those gifted actors who can truly act almost any part he's given. Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack is good. So are Anne Hathaway as Jack's wife Lureen, and Michelle Williams, as Jake's wife Alma.I really like the cinematography. There are breathtaking big sky scenes, with a movingly austere beauty. Country and small-town scenes are exquisitely composed and depicted as well. Night scenes are delightful.My main disappointment is with the story, or the script, itself. And the script is so inadequate that to me it overwhelms the movie's remaining strong features.I have not read Annie Proulx's short story. But the story in the movie version is primarily, IMHO, a Love Story. A Love Story of a special kind: Tragic Forbidden Love. This kind of Love Story takes deft handling to bring it off; and it just plain doesn't work for me in this movie.Compare other well known Forbidden Love Stories: Romeo & Juliet, Lancelot & Guinevere, Tristan & Isolde; Nabokov's Lolita. A modern movie version of Tristan and Isolde is in movie theatres at the same time as Brokeback Mountain, and they really make an interesting contrast. More on that later.Surely what is in common in all these tales is that as long as the Love Story is borne in Fantasy, it carries all kinds of special features that we attach to the Special (if Fantastic) World of Love. The Forbidden Love is carefully cultivated, with plenty of hints, suggestions and flirtations between Lovers. Then Love encounters Reality: and Tragedy results. In each case, we feel the Love very acutely; and we feel the Tragedy very acutely.Compare Brokeback Mountain. Almost nothing prepares us for the initial sexual encounter. When it does happen, we have these two men, who have almost no connection, proceed post-haste to kissing and anal sex. This is perhaps credible for Jack: the implication is that he's experienced in this area. But Ennis ... ? Ennis who, as a child, was shown a man's dead body, brutally murdered for engaging in this kind of sex? There could be some development to get Ennis from that kind of past to anal sex with Jack in the present. But there's no hint of this in the script.Likewise, we see Ennis and Jack becoming friends *after* having sex. I guess this is consistent with the modern myth of how intimate relationships develop. And in terms of (say) Fantasy, that sequence can certainly work in a movie. But again, in terms of the real-life context of a ""realistically"" styled movie, the sequence to me is very unconvincing, unless there is some kind of development. It's not in the script, though.The triangulating couples ... Jack & Ennis, and Jack & Lureen, and Ennis & Alma ... are unconvincing to me in many respects.For example, we have Ennis & Alma waiting for Jack to come to town the first time: then Ennis and Jack start making out in front of the building, in the street, within easy view. What Forbidden Love Story has the Forbidden Love so much in the open? And remember, this is supposed to be 1960s Wyoming; and Ennis is supposed to have deeply etched memories of what can happen to a man who does things with another man. And yet it is *Ennis* who grabs Jake, ignores the public place, and starts making out.Then Alma sees them making out. Alma's face looks almost comically nonreactive. The audience I was in laughed. Then we see Alma's face in painful shock. The audience was then silent. This sets up an amazing pattern for the rest of the movie: the Forbidden Love's consequence to Someone Else is shown, but is first undermined by humor. We are allowed brief glimpses of each wife's pain, but always it's preceded by humor that (I suppose) is intended to minimize the pain for the audience. Contrast Tristan & Isault. The dark side of Forbidden Love ... Treachery, Pain and Suffering ... is shown full force. It's part of what makes Tragic Love so Tragic.Alma never questions Ennis about his infidelity, until long after their divorce. The eventual confrontation dialog implies she's just figuring out that the fishing trips aren't fishing trips. How is this credible? She knew from day one. Both wives are depicted as a cross between the comical and the sad. Other than that, we aren't given enough insight into them to really sympathize. Similarly, all scenes with the children show them as happily oblivious to what's going on. Indeed, if there's any indication that the children, or their parents, are aware that the Forbidden Love might be causing any kind of problems for the children, I missed it. Except, indeed, for some additional odd use of misplaced, scornful, humor.Some symbolism was heavy-handed. For example, the early scenes with Jack and Ennis amid a sea of white sheep, followed by later scenes in which the wives are depicted with white light engulfing them from time to time seemed calculated to help us view their marriages as full of sterile, boring sameness. Contrast the far richer, deeper relationships in Tristan and Isolde.Don't get me wrong: there are wonderful, touching scenes. Many between Jack and Ennis; and a couple of lovely scenes between Ennis and his daughter; and a few others. A good Forbidden Love Story has a lot to commend itself from my angle. Some of the statements ... ""We're stuck"" ""It could be better"" ""It could be more"" ... have wonderful evocations of the Love Story tradition of Longing and Hope and Desire that can be challenging and complex and deeply moving ... in a well told Love Story, that is. However, in this movie, the storyline and script consistencies overwhelm the unfolding of the Story.",Brokeback Mountain
258,Michael Kenmore,This is the most emotional movie-going experience I've ever had,10,19 February 2006,"Growing up a sexually conflicted person, Brokeback Mountain spoke to me like no other film ever did.I'm biologically heterosexual but remain conflicted about having to face the fact that I may be gay -- to be precise, bisexual. I have a famous Roy Schatt photograph blow-up of James Dean 'walking in the middle of the street' poster on the bedroom wall. One thing that I had to accept as a condition to go through life without much emotional baggage is to live in self-denial through repressing my desires, for the sake of maintaining self-respect and living a Christian life.What does the above have to do with the film? The film shows, without cynical manipulativeness and condescension that would cross the line into parody owing to stellar acting by the ensemble cast, superior screenplay adaptation and Ang Lee's gently adept direction, that longing for love out of loneliness lead to expressing one's desire is natural even if one must vigorously deny oneself's desire to be considered socially acceptable.Before I went to see the movie last Saturday night, I had a reservation about the movie being a politically motivated gay propaganda that push buttons to manipulate the audiences. Patch Adams is one kind of a movie I despise the most. The beginning of the movie initially come off as self-important, typical for an art film, but this seeming pomposity eventually wear off and it got better as the film progress.I'd hate to spoil the movie, because it must be seen to be experienced. I had not felt this emotionally deep watching a movie since I saw Dancer in the Dark a number of years ago. I perceive myself to be a cold and stern person, but if the film hits the right note, I let go of the rigid macho state and let the vision roll over me. That's what this film did and the emotional payoff was wondrous, to say the least.What made Brokeback Mountain wonderful is that it does not have an iota of manipulativeness. It felt real. The actors made the movie feel like a world unto itself, as if we know the characters so well they are truly human rather than the product of superficiality in so many fiction movies. This film is the product of a superb artistic craft with the emphasis on character development, which is a commendable accomplishment.Health Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams and a couple of older actors who portrayed one of the main protagonists' parents towards the ending made it an experience that start slow only to become intensely emotional as the film progresses. There is no indication that it might be intentionally manipulative or self-serving as strident gay propaganda. Ang Lee handled the duty of directing the film like a professional-caliber filmmaker with nary a major blunder.Brokeback Mountain exhibit a rare quality not only as a well-directed character drama film, but also a great deal of care and respect for both characters and the audience without being manipulative and condescending.Ang Lee is deserving of a Best Director Oscar for his incredible effort in realizing the vision with Buddhist-like caring aura that made it an amazing movie-going experience in terms of emotional openness.",Brokeback Mountain
259,native_girl333,Two hearts,10,22 June 2006,"I'm a huge fan of Ang Lee- movies. I thought ""Sense and the Sensibility"" is one of the all time's greatest relationship-film. Lee is the kind of director who is not afraid to show the cruel and brutal sides of relationships. Also his directing is very blunt but still so amazingly beautiful.""Brokeback Mountain"" tells a story about two unemployed cowboys who manage to get a job on the mountains herding sheep. With the lack of entertainment the two fall in love.When ""Brokeback Mountain"" came available for the big audience I read many writings that the movie was a gay-cowboy flick. I have always been a big supporter of minorities. I had waited for an honest film to speak the things as they are. Homoerotic love isn't any extraordinary as heterosexuality is. Ang Lee proved this point to be true. So, I didn't want call ""Brokeback Mountain"" a gay-cowboy movie. I think is a bad underestimation of the subject.Again Lee's cast was just brilliant. Heath Ledger and the heart drop Jake Gyllenhaal made strong performances that were rawly beautiful and sensitive. Their chemistry was unspoken. Michelle Williams made a touching role of betrayed wife. Anne Hathaway was surprisingly good as the female love of Gyllenhaal's Jack Twist. But who made a biggest impression was Heath Ledger. His portrayal of southern grumpy cowboy Ennis Del Mar was his best performance yet. Too bad he was up against superb Philip Seymour Hoffman at the Academy Awards. Ledger has a promising career head of him if he manages to get Del Mar-kind of roles.Ang Lee is famous of being a director who aims for showing true feelings. For this time Lee got an young cast that was willing to do everything what he asked for. Lee enjoys doing pictures with young cast because they are easy to make do even the most uncomfortable scenes without any murmurs. On the set of ""Sense and the Sensibility"" Lee got the nickname of brute because of his rough directing.Lee's humane way to make people to become what their feel is worth all efforts. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is beautifully cruel and crude with high emotional sense and sensibility. Annie Proulx's short story is made just the way it should have. Thanks for Diana Ossana and Larry McMurtry's insightful script and the amazing cast.""Brokeback Mountain"" is an ordinary story of two people who just happen to fall in love. It's a story of a universal love. Love and nothing else.I recommend it to everybody who have ever deeply loved someone.",Brokeback Mountain
260,Lily_hoho,Love is love,8,16 April 2020,"There is a moment also let a person mistook for young impulse. As a friend after reading the comment said, wild land, except men are sheep, either men, or sheep. In the end, if you don't choose sheep, you can only choose men. Everyone laughed, want to end a love is so deconstructed by you. I don't think so. If on the spur of the moment, can be in a year after the relaxed farewell, go their way. Will not have to break up when the intense vomiting, like the same; Will not have a long time to remember, and become the only insist on life.I think we should be thankful for the taboo. The taboo of their identity makes love last forever. The big obstacle made the love. People have an innate resistance to prohibition and obstruction. ""Any warm reality of calm, contentment, any rock-solid image of happiness, will be destroyed by the hand of time; The forbidden and damaged love lives forever by the one who exerts power and the one who endures pressure."" Together so difficult, will be particularly cherish; Don't know when goodbye, people will know how to miss. What we see around us too much is the feeling that there is no resistance but no way to end, self-pendulum own goal. In other words, we are in turn putting on such a bad show.As soon as Jack appeared, people could smell the smell of homosexuality, and his appearance was indescribably provocative. He was also more active and honest in his subsequent entanglements. Ennis was silent, restrained and even repressed. Always feel guilty about your feelings. Despite their differences in personality, the two men were really beefy cowboys. Fighting and falling in love. This is where ang lee's brilliance and intention lies. I don't remember his exact words, to the effect that I meant to express love. Pure love. A universal feeling. Love in a broad sense should not be confined to men or women.",Brokeback Mountain
261,Det_McNulty,"Set To Be An American Classic, ""Brokeback Mountain"" Strides Alongside The Great Tales Of Unrequited Love",9,8 May 2008,"Opening to mass public scrutiny and critical acclaim, Brokeback Mountain is easily one of the most controversial American films in recent years. The fuss surrounding the production and eventual release was baffling, with religious groups campaigning for boycotts and cinemas even threatening to not screen the film. Such notoriety backfired, sparking worldwide attention and leading to a surprisingly large box-office reception. In retrospect, the controversy was baffling; it was not as though it was the first mainstream feature to have a narrative based around a homosexual romance. What ""appalled"" the conservative and religious sectors was that the John Wayne, rugged and raw cowboy image had been shattered. Nevertheless, a western setting does not make a western.Emerging two years after his Hulk misfire, Ang Lee was determined to return to his directional roots, while experimenting with a story more challenging than anything else he had attempted before. Upon completion, Lee entered his finished product into the Venice Film Festival line-up, and eventually earned himself the prestigious Golden Lion award. Then the Oscars arrived, where the film earned Lee a Best Director award, along with Best Original Score and Best Adapted Screenplay. The film, adapted from a short story by Annie Proulx, revolves around two down n' out, drifting cowboys who fall in love while ranching cattle together. From then on in the two men secretly maintain their thwarted relationship, visiting each other while both remaining married with children.Performances are the key ingredient to Brokeback Mountain's overwhelming emotional power. The most notable roles are responsible to the two lead male performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Both actors prove to be above and beyond the generic acting standards found in mainstream cinema. Respectably, it is Ledger's performance which is to be cherished; the gentle humanity he brings to his rough and troubled character of Ennis Del Mar is beautifully conceived. The feelings of guilt, the troubled expressions and idiosyncrasies are beautifully mastered by Ledger, showing his ability to capture a man struggling to accept his inner desire to escape with the man he so loves. It is bound to leave a profound impression of imprisonment, and almost any viewer will respond with empathy.Further developing his directional craft, Ang Lee succeeds in establishing himself as one of today's most important and resourceful directors. After the success of grand period-pieces, such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Sense and Sensibility you would not have expected trashy flops like The Hulk. Fortunately, Lee ended up producing a fine counter-piece to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and also evolving his reoccurring theme of characters coping with suppressed emotion in the confines of a judgemental society. What I admire most is Lee's ability to demonstrate the utmost respect for each character, especially valuing the perceptive nature of his camera. His attention to detail is tender and cordial, displaying a much needed humanity rarely found in today's pictures. On the contrary, there are specific moments of episodic allegory which tests the viewer's interpretive skills. Such a device also increases the intimacy and speaks for the questioning turmoil of the characters.With its gorgeous score, striking location footage and motivated acting, Brokeback Mountain does everything a masterpiece should. It is films like Brokeback Mountain that have the capability to make individual members of society become more aware and accepting of homosexuality. Yet, more than anything else it proves that love is an uncontrollable force, whilst holding testament to the beauty of cinema and its ability to captivate the viewer like no other medium.",Brokeback Mountain

263,JimD73,So much more than a gay cowboy movie,8,9 February 2006,"I'll admit, the first time I heard about a gay cowboy movie with huge Oscar buzz, my mind went immediately to that episode of South Park about the independent films with gay cowboys eating pudding. Of course, my second thought was whether or not it would actually be more than just that: a gay cowboy movie. While, I will admit, I was a little scared to go an see this, just because, like any teenage guy, there is a hidden layer of homophobia we often let get the best of us, since I had the opportunity to see this before the Oscars (making it one of two Best Picture noms seen so far, along with Crash), I wasn't going to pass it up. Thankfully, I didn't, as while Brokeback is certainly flawed, it is a moving romance, in spite of the subject matter.The story of Brokeback Mountain is fairly simple at first, but escalates later, meaning that it is hard to tell enough without spoiling it. At the start, Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) and Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal) are hired by Joe Aguirre (Quaid) as ranch hands to take care of getting some sheep across the mountains. This means that the two of them are alone with no company besides each other. One night, after some drinking, the two of them end up sharing the same tent.Well, you can probably guess what happens next. Suffice to say that the two of them had a little more than a hangover the next morning. Instead of trying to put it in the past, Jack and Ennis actually fall in love and continue their relationship until the job is done. They both go their separate ways, get married and have kids. When, four years later, Jack contacts Ennis, they have an affair that puts their normal lives in turmoil.It's when they start the affair that the movie kicks into gear and becomes interesting. This would be about forty five minutes to one hour into the movie. Not say the first half is boring, but it definitely pales in comparison. Before it reaches that point, there seem to be a lot of pointless scenes that really have no significance whatsoever. It could have used a little more editing, to say the least.It is also worth noting that, for the sake of any straight males like myself in the audience, the homosexuality in the movie is actually not all that unnerving. The director played it smart by giving us the most graphic scenes early in the movie, so that the two of them making out later on really isn't that uncomfortable by comparison. In other words, don't be afraid of this movie just because of the content, as if you stick with it, that all becomes a footnote.The main problem about the movie is that it becomes apparent that Ang Lee has no idea how to build up to a romance. I get that they were inebriated, but the first time that Jack and Ennis get intimate, it just seems completely out of nowhere as they had barely bonded whatsoever before then. Not to mention the fact that Ennis was engaged at the time. It seems that they go from just barely past strangers to in love within one night. The same problem does exist, although to a much lesser extent, with Jack and his wife Lureen (Hathaway), though it can be disregarded as the whole sequence of events that encompass that go by fairly quickly.Even if the opening may be awkward, we definitely feel the passion between Jack and Ennis once it has been established, which is a sure sign of the excellent acting. You can really feel the passion they have for each other, despite the conditions under which that passion occurs. Neither of them were expecting it, nor wanting it, to happen, but it becomes an obsession that they both deal with in different ways. Gyllenhaal's Jack is filled with delusions that they should run away with each other and leave their life behind. For his part, Gyllenhaal is absolutely perfect, though it is Ledger who gets the more complex role. Jack Twist is very outgoing and impulsive, and Gyllenhaal shows the depths he sinks to as well as the child inside. Ennis Del Mar, on the other hand, is much more conservative, but his body language says it all, and Ledger perfects that. Both are incredible leading performances.It would be wrong to praise the leads so openly and ignore the supporting cast, as one in particular stands out. That one would be Michelle Williams as Ennis' wife, who watches her marriage fall apart after Jack re-enters Ennis' life. There isn't much to say about her without spoiling parts of the movie, but suffice to say that her performance is definitely award worthy. Anne Hathaway, who plays Jack's wife, does not get as many powerful scenes, but she does quite well considering she was the Princess Diaries star not too long ago. The whole cast overall is quite exceptional, with two incredible leading performances backed up by two strong supporters.Brokeback Mountain isn't just a movie about gay sex. It is about a passion that two individuals have for each other but have to keep covered up for fear of ruining their imperfect lives. After a while, you even forget it is about gay sex at all. That is the true mark of great movie making, especially when dealing with a topic so controversial. This movie definitely has its flaws, but it is one of the best romance movies I have ever seen. It took risks, and they paid off to make one of the best movies of the year.Overall Rating  89%As a footnote, Crash is still my favourite for Best Picture, though I'd have no bad feelings is this took gold.",Brokeback Mountain
264,pied,Broken Hearts,9,10 April 2006,"After all the hype I didn't know what to expect when I saw this movie on DVD. First of all, it's not about ""Love is a Force of Nature."" A tornado is a force of nature--that doesn't make it a good thing.The acting is outstanding as is the directing. This is an expertly made movie.I haven't heard or read of anybody else saying or writing this, but ""Brokeback"" reminded me of ""Anna Karenina. In that classic by Tolstoy, Anna is a very sympathetic character, but her adultery with Count Vronsky has tragic consequences including her suicide. In ""Brokeback Mountain,"" the people really affected by Ennis and Jack's love affair are their two families. Both are destroyed. Adultery always has consequences--bad consequences whether it is two men, two woman, or a man and a woman.Ennis Delmar and Jack Twist made the decision not to stay with each other but to marry and go on with their lives. When they made that deal, they should have kept that deal. By not doing so, they hurt their wives and children eventually destroying their marriages.Another lie I've heard is that this is about two gay men. Wrong. This is about one gay man, Jack Twist, and another more heterosexual man, Ennis Delmar who is obsessed with one male--Jack Twist. Along the spectrum of homosexual/heterosexual love Jack was over there, and Ennis is definitely over here. Jack has other lovers, he has to get sex in Mexican border towns, and eventually is having an affair with another man when he is killed. Not so Ennis. He loves Jack, true, but he dates other women. There will be no other men in Ennis Delmar's live now that Jack is dead. Ennis is not gay.I found this movie very powerful. I loved the women in the movie and think their roles are underrated. I especially loved the scene when Ennis promises to attend his daughter's wedding.Ennis is a good and tender man. I believed his character and thought the whole movie was tremendously sad.",Brokeback Mountain
265,alexx668,"Hype, hype, hype..",5,27 February 2006,"All over the world, the critics hailed ""Brokeback Mountain"" as a masterpiece. Inevitably, the public hailed it as a masterpiece too. After all, It's not the first time that the public, literally brainwashed by the hype and relentless promotion around a certain title, follows blindly. Yes, human opinion is that easy to shape.It seems as if the Americans, or Western society in general, decided it was time for gay love stories to creep into the mainstream, but that doesn't make a good film. Remove the novelty of the gay cowboys love affair, and all that's left is a boring melodrama. Ang Lee's direction is the movie equivalent of a postcard, plastic and soulless. The film hardly says anything meaningful, it is merely the next ""thoughtful"" blockbuster in a series that includes ""American Beauty"", ""Truman Show"", ""Schindler's List"" etc.Basically everyone concentrates on the wrong points. This is far less interesting as a love story, and far more powerful as social commentary: the 2 men follow completely different lifestyles, one is a lower-class outcast, the other becomes a middle-class professional. The former is more bound to social conventions (even though ruined by the system), the latter not so much. Essentially, they are both hypocrites and losers, and especially Ennis (who is more amoral, though a bit of an idealist).",Brokeback Mountain
266,shaid,A must see film,10,20 February 2006,"*MAY CONTAIN SPOILER* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS* *MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*There is very little to say about a film that generate so much reaction. There is little to add to previous positive reactions. I agree with them all. This is a movie that touch you and stay in your mind long after you have seen it. The acting is superb and while Heath Ledger(Enis Del Mare) is excellent, he could not have done it with out all the actors around him and especially Jake Gyllenhaal(Jack Twist). The cinematography is beautiful and serve the film exceptionally. The music is simple but sneak to your heart like the film itself. I think this is one of the rare occasions where a film have managed to describe the word LOVE or the feeling of LOVE without being schmaltz or predictable or even to use the words I love you(the line: ""I wish I knew how to quit you"" is a classic quote-say to someone you love him with out uttering the word love) . One action can say more than a thousands words. Word can deceive you, actions do not.After saying the above I can only add some point or react to other comments and give my own point of view.For me the film starts slowly and I had difficulty getting into the story. Another difficulty for me, has been the fact that the film begins in what I can only describe as cliché way. But the clichés disappeared(as if director And Lee is saying: look beyond the clichés and see the people beyond the clichés) and by the end of the film I was caught with the characters and with the story. They and film itself have griped me in the heart and in the throat and didn't let go. There is no conciliation at the end nor there is a happy ending which can bring relief to the pain I have felt in me when the film end. Even the tears which were going down my cheek were tears of pain, not tears of comfort. The tears of comfort came several days later(but this is another story).Some people claim that the gay element of the story should be ignored and that people should only see this as a film with the universal theme of love. I simply don't agree with this notion. I don't believe that the film would have the same impact if the characters were a man and a woman. A man & a woman don't have to fear for their life when they are in love with each other, as Enis point out to Jake twice in the film. The feeling that Enis express in one point that he think that everyone know about him is a common feeling for gay men in the closet. In short, stop pretending it's not a GAY love story. It is, and there is no way to look around this point.The film treat the audience in the most respect. This is intelligence film making in its best. Director Ang Lee prefer mostly to hint about things than say them out open in the air. 3 examples come to my mind(although I am sure I can find some more). See how Lee show the passage of time. He does not use titles but use cloths, changes in appearance, music. Another point is how he show us how the encounter with Jake is more significant to Enis than he wish to admit. The 1st scene which come to mind is the one right after Enis & Jake come down from Brokeback Mountain and after parting Enis break into tears. This is an heart breaking scene. It show you with no words that Enis know that he had something special which he had never known before and may never know after. And he wants it so much. The 2nd scene is the sex scene with Alma. At a certain moment he turn her over and take her from behind.Without words you can understand that he wants to recapture the intimacy he had with Jake and for him this will be the only way he can get intimate or relive the experience.I can go on and on talking about this film. I don't think I have enough space to say all I want to say. I will summarize by saying that this is a film that has became an instant classic and will be quoted and analysed in future to come. As with classic films, it will be parodied(I have seen already 2 on the internet and there are more to come).It is a film that will affect anyone who watch him. You can not stay indifferent to this film. Audience in general will be moved by the film. Gay audience will appreciate the respect the film shows to his characters. For the first time in many year Gay men are not treated as freaks or as buffoons but as people who need to overcome obstacles in the course of finding love and be loved.In short. Go and see the film. It worth every penny or Dollar(or any other currency you use) you will pay for it.",Brokeback Mountain
267,the-gossip-king,It tears me to pieces just writing this review,5,13 April 2008,"After hearing that Heath Ledger had sadly died I decided I better watch this movie because all I have heard is non stop praise for it. I got hyped up and of course I was disappointed. The idea was terrific and original, the cinematography and music score were beautiful and the acting was amazing. Heath Ledger deserved that Oscar by far for this movie. Sad that he didn't and can't win one now and for a while I though Jake Gylennhall couldn't act. Boy was I wrong. He was amazing and truly put heart into his character. However, the thing that brought this movie down was the story. I did hear this was based on a short story and it feels like Ang Lee took the story and padded it out and instead of throwing in some new twists to make it interesting he has the characters just looking at each other. I also heard the wives weren't in the story so I guess there was an attempt at it but for most of the time all they do is sit there looking suspicious at their husbands. I really think if you can stand slow movies then see this but otherwise don't bother. I salute you Heath Ledger!",Brokeback Mountain
268,mindcat,The Finest Hour for Two Young Actors,9,10 January 2009,"I have viewed Brokeback Mountain a total of three times on a 50 inch plasma. I spaced my views almost six months apart so I could grasp more completely and without prejudice, how I would rate this flick.It is beyond a doubt an American classic and looking back I regret so profoundly the death of Heath, who played Enis. The amount of acting skill and diversity it took to do such a touching and completely honest job, makes this young man, Heath Ledger, a legend.The scenes in the Brokeback were beautiful and allowed me to imagine somehow I was transformed back in time watch these young men.The truth is neither one of the characters was entirely gay, rather bisexual, but they did find each other as their own natural soul mates.Unfortunately cultural prejudice and homophobia prevented them from doing what Jack Twist had dreamed, ranching together on his father's spread.The final scenes are absolutely acted with such depth of character, the viewer is taken to tears. The Brokeback will not have Jack's ashes, since even in death, the culture denies him his final request, his ashes spread upon the Brokeback.Many of the bigots who have posted here on this fine cinema should be ashamed as they bray their ignorance for all to read.A fine film and probably one of the top love stories of all time in film.",Brokeback Mountain
269,kevjfarrell,A first rate movie,10,15 February 2015,"This movie is superbly acted by the two main characters. A realistic portrayal of repressed homosexuality between two guys who keep up the appearance of being macho. Heath Ledger's character tries hard to fight his natural urges but the draw is just too great for him. In his mind it is wrong, but his body tells him otherwise. Jake G's character accepts his sexuality but knows he needs to keep it secret. It portrays an era and a sensitive subject so accurately. I hope macho men aren't put off this movie because of the subject content. It really is worth watching for anybody. The ending is very powerful - full of unspoken emotions. Ang Lee directed this with tremendous skill. Even if you have a problem with homosexuality, put that to one side and watch this!",Brokeback Mountain
270,andrewmerritt-31652,The movie that should have won best picture,7,8 November 2019,"Brokeback Mountain stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger who play two cowboys who begin a relationship together and try to keep it a secret for many years. I feel uncomfortable reviewing this because even if you haven't seen the movie you should know what's it about. And if I'm going to be completely honest with everyone, I liked this movie. It may have not been my favorite movie or made it into my top 10, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. I also feel uncomfortable reviewing this because if you have the courage to admit that you like Brokeback Mountain people automatically assume that you're gay. You don't have to be gay to enjoy this movie and just because you like this movie doesn't make you gay either. And also, there's no law that says that either. And I'm still not going to change my opinion of Brokeback Mountain if someone says I'm gay for liking this movie. I think one of the reasons people are so hesitant on seeing Brokeback Mountain is the plot, but if you look between the lines, it's actually a good movie. But say what you will about Brokeback Mountain, there are some beautiful locations here. I may not appreciate the movie, but I can appreciate the beauty and nature this film has to offer. I felt really uncomfortable watching it, but when the movie cuts to some nature shots I felt at peace and relaxed. This was the film that was robbed of best picture and instead went to Crash. And that's another thing I want to bring up. Even though it may not be the movie for me, I still think it should've won best picture. Where Brokeback Mountain lacks in the film plot makes up for its beautiful directing, cinematography, and sound editing that should be a perfect combination to earn this a best picture win. So overall, as much as I liked this movie, it just wasn't for me, but that still doesn't mean that you shouldn't check this out. Just ignore the plot and accept it for what it is.",Brokeback Mountain
271,Foxbarking,What an amazing film,10,6 January 2006,"I have been waiting for this movie for months now. Usually when that happens, I end up over anxious and disappointed. I didn't this time.I think the movie was pure brilliant film-making. Ang Lee has won me back after ""Hulk."" Lee has always been one of my favorites, but I never understood why he signed on for a superhero movie. It just didn't seem like him.The brilliance in this movie lies in the fact that as I watched it, I felt something was missing from the film. I thought of several ways I would have done it different. I won't say because of spoilers, but there are a few things I would have done in another way. But afterwards, I realized that was the way I should have felt when I left the movie. I felt like something was missing, exactly how the characters felt throughout the entire movie.Heath Ledger definitely deserves an Oscar this year. I have been impressed by a few performances this year, but this has been the Major one, along with Joaquin Phoenix in ""Walk the Line."" But Ledger pulled off the country boy thing really well. I grew up around people like that and he reminded me of a few of them.I think a movie is best defined in how it inspires you. This was the most inspirational film I have seen in years.",Brokeback Mountain
272,Phantasm01,A Masterpiece of Modern Cinema,10,1 July 2006,"Spectacular! There are no words to describe just how moving and honest and real this film is. The bottom line here is a message that transcends all barriers; gay or straight, male or female, rich or poor. The message is that love comes in many forms and if you are ever lucky enough to find a love so deep and strong, you must hang onto it regardless of all other outside factors. And when you don't, you very well could end up with nothing just as Ennis DelMar does. This is not a gay cowboy movie. It is an honest look at love and how two people who have the world against them try to follow their hearts but succumb to the pressures of a society that doesn't understand that love must transcend all.I've read a lot of the other reviews and it seems that everyone has a different take on Jack and Ennis's relationship. But this is how I see it: Yes, they were both gay and they were both in love, not in lust, with each other. Lust doesn't last 20 years and the fact that they did go on to have so-called ""normal"" relationships with the women they married was not because they were bisexual but because they were doing what they thought they ""had"" to do. They tried hard to deny who they really were inside and married women, had families, then girlfriends but this was all part of the social pressure they felt to be ""normal"". Jack had more guts than Ennis did and was desperate to have a life with him because he needed him and loved him so badly, but Ennis was too uncomfortable with his love for Jack, was too embarrassed by it and couldn't have followed his heart because he was too consumed with the murder of the gay man he'd witnessed as a child. It isn't until the end, when Jack is gone, that Ennis comes to the realization that he let the love of his life slip through his hands. His daughter has found love and is getting married, Alma has remarried and Ennis finds himself alone with nothing to love or hang onto because he let his fears and insecurities about who he was come before his true love for Jack. The lesson is a hard one but the message is simple: No matter who you are or who you love, don't let anyone tell you who you should be. If you have love to give, give it freely and to whomever you wish. Never, never, never deny your heart.",Brokeback Mountain

So I decided to see Brokeback Mountain, despite that the reviews made me suspicious.I love Canada. The scenery shots were worth the admission price. No regrets there.I am female without homosexual love experiences. I could relate to the sex scenes in-between the two men, I could not relate to the fact that they were supposed to love each other. It is easy to keep up sexual tension if you meet only from time to time in a recreational atmosphere. It has nothing to do with a love which has to survive the daily grind.The story told in this movie(I have not read the book) is not a love story, the story told is about a love affair drawn out over twenty years, hurting a lot of people on the way. In many of the reviews I read a regret. A regret of not having had the courage to live a love. But if these two would have lived their love consequently, the story would probably have been even more depressing.I left the theater a little bit frustrated. Frustrated because I had not seen the moving love story I expected, but an all too familiar tale of human shortcomings, well portrayed.",Brokeback Mountain
274,antoniatejedabarros,One of the most poetic love stories ever told (and ever performed),10,15 April 2015,"Brokeback Mountain started filming on May 23, 2004 and was premiere at the Mostra Internazionale d'Arte Cinematografica della Biennale di Venezia on September 2, 2005 and released in the States on December 9, 2005. What can I say about this wonderful and poetic movie and Heath's superb portrayal of a tormented gay cowboy that has not been already said? Director Ang Lee is amazing, the music (Gustavo Santaolalla) is touching and beautiful, the cinematography (Rodrigo Pietro) is exquisite and the performances of Heath (Ennis Del Mar) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Jack Twist) are really stunning. Anne Hathaway is quite good and poor unfriendly Ms. Williams couldn't even get the accent right. Although the movie was banned in China and got protests from stupid-right-wing-Republicans in America, the world, especially Europe, loved it. Brokeback Mountain was very important for the gay movement, but the point is that it is a love story, not a gay love story: ""It transcends a label. It's a story of two human being who are in love; get over the fact that it's two men –that's the point"" . The film is based on a short story written by Annie Proulx (originally published in The New Yorker on October 13, 1997). The script was written by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana. Was Ossana who was fascinated by Heath, when she saw him in Monster's Ball. MacMurtry says: ""Diana (Ossana) asked that I watch the first 20 minutes of Monster's Ball to see Heath performance (...) After seeing him in that role, I felt that he had what it would take to play Ennis Del Mar –he was that powerful"". About kissing another man (a stupid sexist question that many interviewers asked Heath), Heath said: ""My biggest anxiety wasn't having to kiss Jake (...) It was a perfect script and Ang Lee was the perfect director. So the anxiety for me was – I didn't want to be the one to f+++ it up"" . Heath describes Ennis Del Mar as ""(an) homophobic male in love with another man"" . Everybody knows that Heath got an Oscar nomination and that, unfairly, he didn't get the award. Although all the Brokeback Mountain and Heath fans were probably very disappointed, since Heath didn't believe at all in awards, he probably didn't care.",Brokeback Mountain
275,qball_82,An amazing piece of cinema..,9,12 September 2005,"I was fortunate enough to see the North American premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival. That was two days ago, and this film just wont leave my mind. Not that I'm complaining because this is what good cinema is all about.Ennis and Jack, two cowboys who fall in love. As others have touched on, Brokeback Mountain is so much more than merely a ""gay cowboy movie"". It perfectly captures what true, unbridled love is all about and this love transcends any issues of sexuality or gender. ""Love is a force of nature"". Unfortunately for many people and indeed the protagonists of our story, society doesn't always view it that way. Kudos to Ang Lee who has not shied away from the material at all. This adaptation stays true to the original short story and the two lead actors fit the roles perfectly. Ledger and Gyllenhaal give incredibly strong performances but the supporting cast shouldn't be overlooked either, particularly a somewhat unrecognizable Michelle Williams. Solid work all around and with Mr Ang Lee's vision they have created an amazing piece of cinema that should not be missed by anybody. Without giving anything away, you are going to be moved by this one.",Brokeback Mountain
276,tml_pohlak_13,How do I hate thee? Let me count the ways...,1,5 May 2009,"""Brokeback Mountain"" won 3 Oscars, and was nominated for 7 more. The late Heath Ledger's performance was praised, as was Jake Gyllenhaal's, and critics hailed it as a masterpiece.Looking at the poster for ""Brokeback"", I noticed that it was very similar to another movie poster, ""Titanic"". According to Wikipedia, it was designed after the ""Titanic"" poster on purpose. And that sums up the movie perfectly: it tries too hard to be touching, to be heart-warming, and to be romantic.Why does everyone praise Heath's performance? He wasn't that great, all he really did was talk through his lips with a deep voice. All of a sudden he deserves an Oscar?This movie was really (also) poorly made and directed. It starts with an awkward and far-too-long silence, and that's just about the whole movie: Ang Lee spends way too much time (for instance) following Ennis and Jack to the bar, showing a lot of (rather lovely at first, but then gets really boring) scenery. Please remind me why Lee got an Oscar for his direction instead of Steven Spielberg for ""Munich""? About 10 minutes into the movie, I'm waiting for something to happen. 20 minutes: ooh! A bear shows up! But nothing ends up coming from it: it's shown, you have an exciting minute waiting for some sort of plot to develop from it, but it turns out that we're coming back to Ennis and Jack after all.I'll cheerfully admit that I'm biased, and that romantic movies really aren't my thing. But ""Brokeback Mountain"" has such a poor plot, casting, direction, and an appalling score (that once more tries too hard to sound romantic)... How bad do I hate this movie? Words cannot describe my feelings.Do you want a well-made (keyword: WELL-made) romance movie? Watch ""Titanic"". I'll take it any day over this junk.",Brokeback Mountain
277,cwrdlylyn,BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN : Beautifully Filmed & Emotionally Powerful...,9,18 January 2006,"BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN The fact that the word love is rarely spoken (if ever) in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a testament to the sheer brilliance with with Ang Lee has handled the tragic love story that is BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. While the tortured love affair between Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger, who's brilliant here) and Jack Twist (Jake Gylenhall) features a beautiful script, it is the unspoken emotion that creeps out of the screen with profound subtlety that truly tells this love story.The story opens one summer when Jack and Ennis are employed to watch over a herd of sheep on BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. It doesn't take long for the introverted Ennis to almost desperately open up to Jack, the only person who seems to have ever provided him every ounce of emotional support he's needed all his life. Their love continues even after both men become married... and they meet as often as possible in the only part of their world where they know how to be happy, on Brokeback.Although the story maintains a constant focus on both men's lives apart from one another, the focus is slightly skewed in Ennis' direction. This is probably because Jack's emotions are more consistent. While Jack is sure he could spend the rest of his life with Ennis, Ennis is too concealed to ever allow himself to come to the same realization on the surface.The irony is that Ennis has the more difficult time living the lie convincingly. His marriage to Alma dissolves slowly from the moment she witnesses a passionate kiss that her husband shares with Jack. The emotional divide between Alma (played beautifully by Michelle Williams, in a performance that will buck all preconceived notions of this former WB star) and Ennis is perfectly captured by Ang Lee's direction. We see the suffrage in Williams' eyes as she struggles to handle her conflicting compassion for Ennis with her anger for being betrayed.One of the most brilliantly played scenes in the film comes in the only moment that Ennis is confronted with the truth. After divorce, and emotional separation, Alma finally has the courage to let Ennis know about Jack... but her reasoning for never bringing it up before becomes clear as Ennis' depression boils over into fury at a moments notice, immediately threatening Alma with a blind rage.Ledger and Gylenhall bring a complete honesty to their roles and they are both phenomenal. The performances are of very different natures, but they have found differences that blend together perfectly in a believable love story. They are never in complete agreement on anything, yet their love for each other is never false. As said before, we never see the two characters say ""I love you""... and they are never overly affectionate with one another. But you can see behind their eyes that somewhere deep down inside the words are begging to come out. Jack longs to say these words to Ennis, but Gylenhall's performance shows that the only thing stopping him is knowing that Ennis could be scared off. Ennis fears saying the words b/c he's someone who has been so internal for so long... embracing his emotions and going against society scares him to death. While Ennis' is the ""tougher"" of the two, he simply isn't strong enough to be what he wants to be... and we see this eating away at Ledger in every frame of the film.Anne Hathaway as Jack's wife Lureen is wonderful as well, and in her final phone conversation with Ennis she is riveting... but the role doesn't pack the emotional wallop that the other characters do.Ang Lee has crafted a masterpiece with BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. It often feels as if you are not watching a movie, b/c it is so simple in it's beauty. He never cheats the jilted women, but he never makes the men have to apologize for anything. The pressure of society at that time is always clear, though never too in-your-face. Instead of focusing on outside influences, Lee looks into his two leading men to show what fear of society can do to a man. The imagery is beautiful, and even as I watched Ennis and Jack hold possibly the worst summer job ever, I completely realized and believed that for these characters, that awful job was a blessing.I only saw the film last night, and I possibly need to digest it more... and see it again to more so appreciate everything that Lee contributed to the film. On first viewing for me, it was all about the performances. So I can't put my finger on what it was exactly that Lee did so well... but I know he has constructed a classic. It's a film that can preaches without ever even coming close to being preachy... and a film that grabs it's audience at the gut without ever reaching out of the screen. BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN lets it's audience slowly come on their own, and through that connection with the characters, it becomes one of the most powerful love stories ever captured on film....

278,hughman55,"June 26th, 2013, DOMA and Prop 8 - Struck Down",10,27 June 2013,"There are 2225 reviews of this film here at IMDb. On this momentous day when a good measure of marriage equality has been recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States I would like to add the 2226th. When I first saw this movie I was with my partner of 13 years and it was December of 2005. For the next two days I was in a state of sensory overload. And no matter where I was or what I was doing, this film, it's characters, and the story, ran unbridled through my head. We went back to see it again two days later. And then again the next day. And finally, a total of somewhere around fifteen times. I'm not sure because I lost count around ten. We held hands as we watched this film pour over us like a waterfall from this giant screen and for the first time understood, in a way we couldn't have ever understood before, the power of ""the big screen"". For the first time we understood what other couples experienced as they would watch films like ""The Shop Around the Corner"", ""Romeo and Juliet"", or ""Shakespear in Love"", in the giant format. It was overwhelming. For the first time in our lives we weren't watching from the outside. The raw emotion, love, hurt, happiness, and sadness was in ""our language"". And so over and over again, we sat in a dark theater, holding hands, and watched our lives for the first time, role by on a giant screen. We could have gone fifteen more times.Our story, on paper, didn't resemble the one in Brokeback Mountain. We were actually very happy and loved and accepted by our friends and families. The tragedy of this story, though, was that Ennis could not bring himself to live the life he was meant to live and enjoy the richness of what could have been. He let the world decide his happiness. Or, unhappiness as it were. I found that heart breaking; and felt maybe just a touch of survivors guilt along with the sadness. A month later, coming home from visiting our families for Christmas, after these numerous viewings of this film, I was thinking about the part of the story that dealt with the regret for what might have been. The part about how this man diminished the importance of his happiness to the point of no longer believing he needed it or was entitled to it. Either way the result was the same: living in a prison without bars. I then took a moment to reflect on our lives together and asked myself if there was any way in which I/we might be doing the same thing to ourselves; and I remembered that about ten years earlier we had talked about getting ""married"". It would have only been a private ceremony for family and friends with no legal standing but it would have been an important public declaration of who we were. Ultimately we didn't go through with it. And the reason we didn't go through with it shocked me as I realized it, in that car, driving home, that Christmas. We had diminished it mentally and emotionally to the point that we no longer believed we needed or even deserved it. Mostly because we couldn't have it, for real. But in fact now, in 2005, we could get legally married in Massachusetts. Thinking about that film, thinking about how those characters had deprived themselves of a happiness they could have had, I proposed to my partner. I told him that I thought we had bought into the lie that we didn't deserve this, or it wasn't important, or that it didn't matter, because that's what most people believed. I told him how much I loved him and how I didn't want to wake up 13 more years from now even more disconnected from what our true happiness could be. Should be. We married in Boston a month later in January of '06. We flew there from Texas and faked a residence by using a friends home address, opening a bank account, and putting our friend's utilities in our names. Even though it felt a little like a cold war spy mission, the ceremony was very moving for us and our one witness. So, this film changed our lives in an unexpected way. I will never forget sitting in that theater, holding hands with my now husband, and seeing that film tower over us like a skyscraper from that giant screen. It is still overpowering thinking about it today, June 26, 2013, as we are now recognized as legally married in the eyes of the U.S. Federal Government. Is Brokeback Mountain also a great film? Absolutely. Is this a very good film review? No. But there are 2225 film reviews here to argue the merits of what I believe to be a terrific film. At this moment in time it is my intention to take the opportunity to say what a life changing film this is. My husband and I just celebrated 22 years together on our last anniversary. Today we celebrate equal justice under the law. But it was this film, back in 2005, that revealed to us the invisible bars we had wrongly accepted and placed around our own lives, and opened up the opportunity for us to rectify the injustice we had done to ourselves. And today, the U.S. Supreme Court has delivered us a long overdue measure of justice and removed it's bars from around our lives. This is a great film. And it was a life changer for us. And today, June 26, 2013, I just wanted to mark this historical moment.",Brokeback Mountain
279,dwr246,Groundbreaking movie about a heartbreaking love that develops while doing backbreaking labor,9,6 March 2006,"Ang Lee does indeed manage to create a groundbreaking film in this tale of two cowboys who fall in love, but must keep their relationship secret. The story is told honestly and directly, with little sentiment or sensationalism. The end result is a movie that has resonated with the American public at large - no small feat given its subject matter.Brokeback Mountain tells the story of Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger), two cowboys who meet one summer while tending sheep on Brokeback Mountain for Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid), a rancher whose only quality seems to be that he looks down and dislikes everyone. While their personalities are almost diametrically opposite - Jack is a gregarious idealist, while Ennis is a taciturn realist - they soon become friends and eventually become lovers for the summer. As the summer draws to a close, they have differing views on whether or not to continue their relationship. Jack would prefer to find a place where he and Ennis can set up a ranch and stay together. Ennis, having seen first hand what happens to gay men in ranch country, wants no part of that scenario. The two men part company at the end of the summer. Ennis marries his sweetheart, Alma (Michelle Williams), while Jack hits the rodeo circuit, eventual marrying Lureen Newsome (Anne Hathaway). Both have children. However, after a few years, Jack finds Ennis, rekindling their romance, which ends in tragic consequences for all involved.Ang Lee is a master story teller, and it is apparent in this film. Every aspect of the production serves to further the telling of the story. The cinematography is gorgeous, serving to highlight how natural the relationship between Jack and Ennis is to them. The pacing is unhurried, allowing the viewer time to absorb what is going on and internalize it. Even the music, haunting and melancholy, serves to subtly reinforce the sense of the story.The writing is spectacular, deserving the accolades it has garnered. The characters presented are believable. Their reactions to their situations are understandable, if occasionally unfortunate. And, in a refreshing change of pace, the wives are presented sympathetically, rather than as unlikable characters. You feel for both of them in the situations they have found themselves in. There is some ambiguity, particularly as regards Jack's fate, but the deliberateness of that ambiguity helps to accentuate how little Ennis knows of what becomes of Jack, and what he fears could have happened to Jack. Ennis' visit to Jack's parents house is particularly well crafted, showing a self absorbed father, and a mother who knows, but cannot directly acknowledge the truth. While not a happy ending, the film does have a hopeful one in that perhaps Ennis has grown before it's too late for him.The acting was also excellent. Gyllenhaal's Jack ages from optimistic idealism to hurt cynicism in a believable arc. Ledger shows Ennis' self protective reserve quite well, although his unemotional monotone begins to wear after awhile. Still, given the truth with which he shows his character, you can forgive it. While I had trouble emotionally connecting with their characters, I feel both actors still turned in fine performances. William's Alma is a nicely drawn portrait of a woman trying to constructively cope with a difficult situation. Hathaway's Lureen never loses her sweetness, even as she becomes more worldly and jaded. Quaid's Aguirre is malicious and menacing, and Roberta Maxwell's portrait of Jack's mother is a lovely performance in an unfortunately small part. Kate Mara's presentation of Ennis' daughter in one of the final scenes is also nicely done.It is ironic that the religious right objected to this movie as stridently as they did. While their sexuality was not presented as evil, these are not gay men who fare well. By the end of the movie, one is dead, and the other is an emotionally shattered wreck living alone in a small trailer. What more could a homophobe want? Also, much was made out of the assertion that Jack is a predator. While I didn't read him that way, it was definitely a valid interpretation. In the end, it doesn't matter, because the relationship and what it does to their lives is what's most important in this film.While the movie was ground breaking on many levels, it also highlights how far the American movie viewing public has to go regarding the issue of homosexuality. Brokeback Mountain did successfully appeal to the mainstream, but perhaps that is because it portrays very manly men, who ultimately don't stay together, and marry women and have children instead. When a movie with two men who stay together has this kind of appeal to the masses, we will be making real progress. Even more so when the men are not of an age, and the older is not denounced as a pedophile or predator. Still, this is a huge step down that road, and one we should all be thankful for.",Brokeback Mountain
280,irish23,WHAT a letdown,2,12 February 2009,"After all the years of hype, I finally decided to see this film, even though it's a Western (I generally hate Westerns). Ang Lee did indeed create some gorgeous cinematography, and the acting is out of this world, particularly Heath Ledger's phenomenal characterization.Regrettably, I found the movie as a whole totally boring and ultimately frustrating. It's supposed to be some fabulous love story -- where's the love? I get the passion and the strong, undying physical attraction, but that's a small piece of what love is. Love isn't about periodic idyllic getaways with a lover -- that's a vacation. It's easy. Love is the everyday slog. Every day, re-forging your commitment and somehow making it play out. Both men were complete failures in that regard, perhaps because they were with the wrong spouses, perhaps because they weren't with each other. The fundamental problem with the picture is that it doesn't make that clear.The men lead two completely separate lives -- one where they're with their families, and one where they're together. Perhaps if Lee had shown some overlap, the love aspect would've been more believable. Perhaps if there had been more conflict and more tenderness in the men's time together rather than just companionable silence or awkward sex, it would've demonstrated what a real love relationship was like.Ennis' terror of discovery was completely believable and real. Yet that terror doesn't excuse the lack of love demonstrated on screen. His affection for his eldest daughter was more apparent than his love for Jack, even when he and Jack were sharing private moments.I was greatly disappointed in the film. It was lovely but too slow, and ultimately torpedoed by its glaring omission of real love.",Brokeback Mountain
281,eschetic,A flawed masterpiece is still a masterpiece,8,11 December 2005,"Last night my partner of 24 years and I went to see BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN (which appears to be solidly selling out for the full first weekend across the river in Manhattan). Hyped within an inch of its cinematic life and not without flaws (Heath Ledger's central character has the one of several moments of inexcusable carelessness outside his town apartment too *early* in the film for full credibility, and the stories of his and ""Jake's"" marriages are not fleshed out entirely satisfactorily - that would have taken a longer film that was probably commercially feasible), but my Lord, was this a moving, satisfying film! Ang Lee paints gorgeous cinematic pictures, and if he OVERkills the ""shit-kicking stoicism"" of Heath Ledger's ""Ennis"", Lee creates an emotional landscape that those of ANY ""orientation"" should recognize and identify with - though those who are . . . or are aware how many people they know are . . . gay or bisexual will find the film most beautifully observed and poignant. Set in 1963 and the years following (without significant reference to any of the world changing events of those years) this landscape flirts with an almost classic melodramatic trap: Ennis as a boy was horrifically traumatized by his father - Jake Gyllenhaal's ""Jack"" is the more equipped to deal with the realities of the plot situation - in fact, for two coming from the same ""hard scrabble"" poverty and lack of education, he DOES handle it better, yet we follow Ennis' story rather than Jack's. Make no mistake; these are not ""role models"" any more than O'Neill's Tyrone family in LONG DAY'S JOURNEY INTO NIGHT are, but they are recognizable human archetypes. Ennis, in his unresolvable frustration is brusk and uncommunicative ...occasionally drunk and abusive. Jack, more self aware, is no better able to communicate and lucky to find a wife who knows better how to cope with his limitations. In lesser hands, this could have been a sorry soap opera. Instead, it is a life affirming recognition of people's ability to endure and grow even when not always making the right decisions or believing they have better alternatives.I've read a very few (for the most part revealing their own unacknowledged bigotry) questioning how ""middle America"" will take to BROKEBACK..., but when I was back in Kansas for my 20th College Reunion some years ago (one of only two in my graduating class who were ""out"" - as I had not been in school - and one of only half a dozen who were now living in ""big cities""), the stories I heard from married classmates still living between the coasts almost make me feel in retrospect that this film was made ABOUT a lot of people I went to school with - the poverty and lack of education aside. This film should do very well in ""middle America"" - even if, as the Grandfather in Saturday's ""Boondocks"" comic strip said, there will be a lot of people who ""don't want to talk about it."" The prospects abroad, where they aren't as provincial as recent years have shown parts of our country to be, should be even greater.Most people won't even notice the fine score, it's so subtly and perfectly chosen. The music is not only perfect for the scenes supported and good music from our own lives - akin to the great compilation made for THE BIG CHILL years ago. From the Spanish version of ""Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps"" (recognized by many as the theme song for both the wonderful British and failed American sitcom, COUPLING), used during ""Jack's"" trip to Mexico to the perfectly taciturn (matching Ennis' character) Willie Nelson recording of ""He's My Friend"" which almost brings tears over the final credits it's outstanding. I haven't heard a better final piece of music since Bette Midler's ""You Got To Have Friends"" capped THE LAST OF SHEILA in 1973. It's one of this film's few weaknesses that the music score *doesn't* end there. If the song were new - I suspect it may just be new to me - it would have close to a lock on this year's ""Best Song"" Oscar.The film is, in many ways, a moving blend of SAME TIME NEXT YEAR, A RIVER RUNS THROUGH IT and Almodovar's BAD EDUCATION. It should be for American cinema as groundbreaking and successful as Fellini's LA DOLCE VITA was for Italian. It is almost guaranteed Oscar nominations for Adapted Screenplay, Actor for Ledger, Director, Cinematographer and Picture. At this point, BROKEBACK... may have a lock on Adapted Screenplay (possibly setting a record for the least actual words in the sound era ever to win that award) and be ""the one to beat"" for Best Picture. Gyllenhaal and Michelle Williams (who plays Ennis' wife) will deserve ""Supporting"" nominations, but Gyllenhaal is clearly the second lead and Williams' character is too drearily dislikable. While we want to pity her, Ennis' wife brings more than half her problems on herself (not least by forcing their young family to move), rather than being the victim of her husband's ambivalence. It is fascinating to watch the actress who plays *Jake's* wife (Anne Hathaway) as she brings a perfect subtext of knowledge to her under-appreciated role. She doesn't play for Oscar baiting pathos, but may actually be giving the BETTER performance for its reality.Rereading the original New Yorker story (at www.newyorker.com/printables/archive/051212fr_archive01), even though I do not agree with some of the conclusions Ennis draws in it - makes the achievement of the film's largely faithful screenwriter all the more impressive.Good story, wonderful film. Flaws and all. Not to be missed by anyone who loves serious cinema and is adult enough to be secure in their own sexuality.",Brokeback Mountain
282,Michael-70,"A Film Full Of Real Pain, Still It Is Cathartic To Watch.",10,22 December 2005,"A question, IS it better to have loved and lost than to never have loved at all? Brokeback Mountain forces you to confront such conundrums. Heath Ledger stars as Ennis, a taciturn youth orphaned as a boy. He was raised by his siblings and he has never owned up to having any strong feelings of any kind, especially none for himself. One summer in 1963, he goes up to the titular mountain and along with Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) they are given jobs tending sheep.One night, after consuming a pint of whiskey, these two young men have sex with each other. I won't say they ""made love"" because this first time it is just a rough bout of alcohol fueled sex. They could easily brush it off with a, ""I was so drunk last night, I don't know what I did!"", but they don't. Instead, before long, the rough mounting Ennis gave to Jack initially, slowly turns into mutual caressing, tender kissing and other playful physical contact.Both are high school dropouts with little future. Neither got much nurturing from parents or siblings, so this sudden discovery that they are both worthy of love and that they have the capacity TO love is scary. This fear is made worse because they are two guys. Whoops! It ain't supposed to be like that! Some reviewer's point out that Ennis and Jack have no words to describe what is happening to them but they do have words for what it's not. ""I'm not a queer"", Ennis tells Jack. ""Neither am I"", comes the reply. I have never seen a film with so much Homo-sex in it, but so little queerness as this one.Ennis goes on to marry Alma, a plain girl and by all rights, this should be the end. If it were, then Ennis might have a chance at normal happiness, but the ""love that dare not speak its name"" is also the love that won't go away.Four years later Jack sends a post-card saying he's coming by for a visit and Ennis is beside himself with anticipation. When Jack finally shows up, they greet with warm handshakes, hugs and then to their surprise and delight, they kiss with intensity. Ennis's wife sees this kiss and wisely says nothing. Yet, Michelle Williams quite brilliantly shows us the wife's pain as she watches her husband kiss another (and a man no less) with more passion than he has ever kissed her.Ennis and Jack decide to keep up this relationship with quarterly ""fishing trips"" wherein they are gone for weeks at a time, but never seem to bring home any fish. Both of them move like zombies on autopilot between fishing trips, for it is only then they feel they can be happy.Jack seems to have accepted that Ennis is his true love and he pushes for Ennis to settle down with him on a ranch together. It is the hopeful Jack who drives from Texas to Wyoming in an instant without thinking when he hears about Ennis's divorce. Jack also seems to have come to terms with his sexual attraction for men. In fact, when he can't have Ennis, he's off with the husband of one of his wife's friends or down in Mexico paying a male prostitute.Later, when Ennis visits Jack's childhood home and we meet his bastard parents and see the sparseness of his loveless upbringing, we see that Jack has indeed overcome a lot. But Ennis, dear Ennis, poor doomed Ennis only has eyes for Jack. I don't think he would be happy with another man or even another woman.Although Jack dies young in the film, it is Ennis who is the sad tragic character. The Chinese have it right, if you really want to hurt somebody, don't kill them; just let them live. Till the day Ennis dies he will have a dull ache in his heart named Jack. He'll also have the pain of knowing he could have been happy with Jack but he didn't act on it, and probably even drove Jack away.Brokeback Mountain wisely does not blame society for this dysfunction in Ennis. It would be too easy to place them in a blatantly homophobic environment. Homophobia is alluded to in the film, but clearly, in this case, the fault is not in society's inability to understand the love between Ennis and Jack, but in Ennis's inability to understand it. ""If you can't fix it, you have to stand it"", is how Ennis sees his duty.Taking a cue from the philosophical idea that you can never really understand a thing until it is taken out of everyday context; this thing called ""love"" becomes problematic if the object of your affection is not what you think it should be. Meaning, if Ennis had felt this strong love for a female, he WOULD have done something about it, but when Cupid shot the arrow into his heart, the name on the arrow was Jack. Nothing in his experience had prepared him for that, so he effectively shut down, even though Jack wants to live with him, he is too tortured to make the leap into Jacks more than willing arms. It is true, the strongest prisons are the ones we build for ourselves.Heath Ledger is excellent and so is Gyllenhaal, although Ledger has the harder role, emoting without saying or doing much, unlike the carefree Jack. The film-making here is solid and classical in style, there is no attempt to deconstruct the western genre here. It is a love story pure and simple, a doomed love story and so belongs in the realm of Romeo and Juliet, Gone With The Wind, Manhattan and Titanic. Brokeback Mountain is a touching and well-crafted story and film.",Brokeback Mountain
283,marcosaguado,The Heart Of The Matter,10,16 December 2005,"I didn't believe for a moment that the film could live up to the hype, or to some of the comments posted here, some of them read like love letters to the film, to the director and the actors. Well, now, after seeing the film, I feel like writing a love letter myself. The film took over my senses and transported me. The tragedy that envelopes the lives of Ennis and Jack is caused by an ancestral ignorance that is part of our DNA and if you don't believe me read some of the hateful comments posted here alongside the love letters. That's the heart of the matter. After the summer in Brokeback Mountain, Ennis and Jack go their separate ways and Ennis hits a wall with his fists crying, trying to destroy his longing, self loathing, guilt, horror. Imagine in a world without ignorance and therefore without hatred, Ennis and Jack could have celebrated their love and attempt an honest life together. Imagine also if things were the other way and heterosexuals were the dark minority, imagine falling in love with a girl and having to keep it secret, never been able to tell or to show publicly your love for her. Men like Ennis, and there are many, have to curve their own emotions and conform, entering and developing unhappy marriages and why? Read some of the comments here and you'll understand why. There is one that condemns the movie and what the movie may do for his kid and his vision of cowboys without actually having seen the movie! That's the heart of the matter. I will go and see the film again tomorrow, if I can get tickets, I'm taking with me a group of people that hate the movie already without having seen it. I won a bet so they will have to. I'm taking them to diner later to talk. I intend to report the results if you let me. But for the time being let me tell you, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is an extraordinary film. Jake Gyllenhaal, Ann Hathaway and the magnificent Michelle Williams give superb performances but it's Heath Ledger's film. He gives us something that nobody could possibly have expected because what he gives us is not only, honest and moving and powerful but totally and utterly new.",Brokeback Mountain
284,alanpuzey,Is praise for this film a result of political correctness?!?,2,14 April 2006,"My lover and I watched this movie in anticipation and at the end asked one another what the fuss was about. Oscar contender! The only reason we could see for the praise for this film was that Americans thought it a cutting edge movie involving gays. Hey, Europeans have been making such movies, and far better ones for decades - it's only that the USA is so homophobic that this is making any noise now. Even much better American films dealing with gay and mixed sexuality have been made during the past five years. It was filmed well, and had some nice touches, but was ultimately BORING. I think I must add that Ang Lee seems to be a critic's favourite at the moment for I also thought that 'Crouching Dragon' was again completely overrated. Please watch far more ancient films such as 'Death in Venice', 'The Servant' or 'Victim' to see how well this subject can be treated.",Brokeback Mountain

In real life, they cannot be together due to various reasons. The two love each other but cannot be together, this feeling is so contagious and heartbreaking!",Brokeback Mountain
286,kaaber-2,"Breakheart, rather ...",10,26 December 2005,"First of all, I planned to see ""Good Night and Good Luck"" but arrived too late. Then, one of the previews was for Wright's new ""Pride and Prejudice"", which seems to confuse Austen's subdued conversation piece with ""Wuthering Heights"", as far as melodrama is concerned (I may be unfair, though). And after this, ""Brokeback Mountain"" took me quite by surprise. It is so slow moving that I would undoubtedly have skipped passages if I had seen it on DVD. Luckily, I did not. Based on a David Hare-like and highly romantic idea that we can search all our lives for that moment of happiness that eluded us at the crucial crossroads of our lives, ""Brokeback Mountain"" tells the love story of two guys - cowboys, at that - through twenty years of glimpses. True to the character of the unusually tight-lipped Ennis (Ledger), only the bare essentials are told, tip-of-the-iceberg Hemmingway-style, crass realism, no frills whatsoever, and for that very reason, I believe, the tragic undertow of the story hits all the harder when it finally dawns on us. When thinking of the film afterwards (and it's one of those films where that cannot be helped) you find that you know all you need to know about the characters, in spite of the seemingly scant info. There are little hints that both the main characters have had loving, caring mothers and horrid fathers, for instance, and they are both marked, in each their own way, by a deeply moving innocence, so as to constitute a community of saints, with Brokeback Mountain as another Eden. Ang Lee, Heath Ledger (extremely touching, as he was in ""Monster's Ball"") and Gyllenhaal are geniuses, and so is MacMurtry, I presume - he is only one of the two scriptwriters, but the sentiment of ""Brokeback"" matches his ""Lonesome Dove"" and ""Dead Man's Walk"" accurately. Moreover, I can't recall seeing another film that so successfully adds 20 years to its main characters. Gyllenhaal is helped by a paunch and a mustache, but Ledger seems to do it all by acting. A rare talent. I hope some Oscars will make the trip up Brokeback Mountain.PS! I HAVE TO RE-EDIT my review (which I will now do) - I have JUST found out that Larry McMurtry wrote the screenplay for ""The Last Picture Show"" - I didn't know before now, but I swear that I had that 1971 film in my mind when, and after, seeing ""Brokeback"". I was just about to add that title in the above after mentioning the two McMurtry series, scout's honour, but then I thought it would be strangely confusing to do so just because I sensed some similarity. But beshrew my apprehensions! ""Last Picture Show"" is another modern-day western, sad and hopeless like nothing else - it choked me up back then and continued to haunt me for years. I am now inclined to send one more bucket of credit McMurtry's way.",Brokeback Mountain
287,mfsor,Superb,7,7 January 2006,"This movie was somewhat boring during the first half, even though there is beautiful mountain scenery. Maybe if you're gay, you think the interaction between the characters is interesting enough. The movie is about this interaction, and after their first summer together, it follows their relationship is a serious and intelligent manner. Their relationships to their wives is shown in the same manner. The difference between them is also portrayed with detail and sensitivity. Heath Ledger does a superb job in his Gary Cooper-like non-talking cowboy. I did enjoy the movie very much. It was about the development of a romance, but the fact that it showed scenes of them getting together every few years made me think it would have worked better as a long novel (yes, I know it was based on a short story).",Brokeback Mountain

I must confess that I was a bit ambivalent about the film, because of all the (mostly, positive)advance publicity.I was blown away by the film; performances all round are excellent, from the ""supporting women"" in the cast - a very good Michelle Williams, who by her body language and the silences, shows so much. And Anne Hathaway, as Jake Gyllenhaal's wife, is superb! Ang Lee's film is highly atmospheric, and is beautifully photographed. Both Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger are good, natural and one feels for them in their 20 years' of unspoken love.Heath Ledger is outstanding: he underacts, and that gives his performance added strength. It's an excellent film, more honest in its portrayal of same-sex love than Philadelphia. In fact, the film doesn't examine sexuality at all: it is primarily a love story.It's a tender film, visually haunting, an Ang Lee is to be congratulated on a film that does not leave one's psyche after seeing it: it is engaging, satisfying and provoking.Game, set and match!",Brokeback Mountain
289,adeckofcards,An impossible love,9,25 July 2020,"In 2005, the director Ang Lee ventured to direct a film that deals with a subject, until then, little explored.
The story follows two cowboys, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, who during a summer in the mountains begin a relationship beyond friendship.
In appearance, with this story Ang Lee could be raising a flag for this group, however the film is not only limited to this speech. What is really expressed on screen is something much sadder and more painful, an impossible love. Many of them have already been presented in the history of cinema, but in this case Lee focuses completely on the consequences that this generates for the characters and how they both deal with this. The actors here play an important role, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal provide their characters with body language so explicit that words are not necessary to bare the soul and feelings they experience.
A beautiful landscape that hides a deeply painful secret for its protagonists is what Ang Lee offers with this love story that is really the story of a tragedy, of a dream destroyed by the impossible.",Brokeback Mountain
290,segacs,Slow but poignant,8,23 December 2006,"Brokeback Mountain is a simple, tragic love story.There, I've said it. Because, once you strip away all the media attention and hype surrounding this movie, that's all it is. No more, no less. It's a story of forbidden love, as old and as tragic as any Romeo-and-Juliet-based tale. And if it weren't for the fact that it was about a couple of dudes, most people probably would have never heard of it. (After all, how many of you saw ""The Shipping News""?) It's well-acted, to be sure. Jake Gyllenhaal is particularly good as Jack, and the absolutely gorgeous Heath Ledger holds his own pretty well as Ennis, despite a disastrous attempt at a Wyoming accent. The interplay between the two is mostly non-verbal and is well done.The cinematography is beautiful, the scenery (mostly filmed in Alberta, Canada) is gorgeous, and there is fantastic use of symbolism. Yes, it's a bit slow at times, and yes, it's quite sad, but it is really a beautiful movie when it comes down to it.It's a real shame that this movie will be most remembered for a couple of sex scenes in a tent. Because it's about so much more than that. Love, loss, passion, jealousy, uneven relationships, hope and despair - all universal human emotions that have nothing to do with sexual orientation. With all the talk about gay rights and equality, I think that there will only truly be equality when we can judge a love story - gay or straight - on its own merits.

Many did. Some were gay, some were not. Gays did have to stay in the closet then, but these characters, don't even have the guts to do that! I think their lack of backbone aggravated me about as much as anything in this film.They never do anything to make things better between them.The other highly unsatisfactory thing about this film is that the men are portrayed as if being homosexual is just a choice. They have no obvious problems in being with women.Nor do we get any backstory on them regarding sexual orientation when they were growing up.The sex between them is very sudden, with no lead-in, no hint whatsoever that homosexuality has ever even crossed either of them's minds.Jack is made to be the ""gayer"" of the two, in that he does eventually get it on with a couple of other guys. Ennis never does. Yet even Jack marries, fathers a child, and remains married. He and his wife drift apart somewhat, but no more so than a straight couple might.Both Jack and Ennis are portrayed as losers. Ennis never makes a decent wage. Jack marries into money, but his father in law barely manages to tolerate him.The two lead actors do their parts well, and there's beautiful Wyoming scenery, but this film really did no great service to the gay community as far as I am concerned.",Brokeback Mountain

The relationship was mostly built on promiscuity, and not so much on emotional connection. They were attracted to their wives as well; cheating is cheating. Later on, Ennis's now ex-wife revealed that she knew of this secret relationship. Ennis grabbed her arm violently. And I say, physical abuse is abuse. To add on, they were absent and alcoholic fathers. Their secret relationship was toxic; there is mutual blame, no self-care, no change, no responsibility, and their own families disregarded. What is emotionally disturbing is the bigotry not being addressed. Bigotry brought on by Aguirre (their previous employer) and Ennis' father (who forced him -as a child to watch the torture and killings of two males.) Overall, I disliked the misconceptions highlighted around these bi/gay characters.",Brokeback Mountain
295,PaulLondon,An Instant Classic,10,11 January 2006,"Forget all the 'gay cowboy' furore and watch this film with an open mind and you will be open to watching one of the truly great films of the last few years.The film is nothing less than a masterclass is directing, writing and acting. The story of the relationship between two men and how it effects the rest of their lives is delivered with intelligence, integrity and sensitivity by all concerned.The film has more in common with the classic cinema of the early 70's than it does with the loud, dumb films that Hollywood churns out today and it never underestimates the intelligence of the audience. The script is sparse but beautiful and allows the viewer space to understand the feelings and raw emotions that seethe beneath the surface. Lee's direction is flawless; he paces the film beautifully and avoids excess melodrama in favour of real emotions. The acting is quite stunning, the two leads say as much with their looks of longing and quiet despair as they do with their words and they are superbly supported by a faultless cast.This is a film that resounds and resonates. It is achingly human with all the joy and sadness that entails. Don't miss it as this really is an instant classic",Brokeback Mountain
296,villard,Flawed Classic,6,6 January 2008,"This is a top-quality motion picture, beautifully filmed, astutely edited, largely well-acted, with an outstanding music score.However, the film is inexplicably crippled by the way the character Ennis Del Mar is played by Heath Ledger. Thought one of the two lead characters  and having the most screen time - - he mumbles his way through the film and is frequently barely understandable. This becomes a significant distraction. It disengages viewers trying to follow the drama.His persona is equally distracting. I have known several terribly shy people but never one so acutely introverted they come off as clinically depressed. So the viewer is distracted again wondering what's wrong with this guy. It's not just his sexual adventures.Finally, the screenplay gave me little insight into homosexuality in the 60s and 70s. All I came away with is that these two guys are confused, frustrated and fearful about the deadly consequences of leading an openly gay lifestyle. The Jack Twist character hits it off so well with women I don't know if the two cowboys are bisexual, homosexual, or experimenting heterosexuals, or *whatever.* Sensitive as the film is, it doesn't help in building gay social acceptance. Also, I can't remember a film about a heterosexual love affair where the where the cheaters get so much sympathy while they deceive and hurt others.",Brokeback Mountain

The first time I saw this I hadn't read the story or any spoilers, so the ending was all the more effective. When I did read, I discovered that this is one of the most faithful adaptations ever. Perhaps scenes took place in a different order, but they're all in the film. (Apart from a disturbing flashback.) The minor characters are fleshed out nicely for the cinema.

And that's when I found out how heartbreaking the end actually was. And not just the end, the whole story about two people that want to be together but the time and the circumstances are not right is just terrible. And because of people arrogant and stupid thinking, they couldn't live their live as they wished. And god, I felt so lucky because I have the freedom to live the life that I want.

300,severindringel,"A beautiful and sad film about heartbreak, passion and self-discovery",9,19 February 2021,"This 2005 romantic film is the acclaimed masterpiece of Taiwanese director Ang Lee. Brokeback Mountain was the loser of arguably the most controversial Oscar decision of all time when it was defeated by Crash in the Best Picture race. The shock was deep because this film told the heartbreaking story of same-sex lovers Ennis and Jack, finally addressing the taboo subject of homosexuality in Hollywood at the time.Heath Ledger (Ennis) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Jack) embody the two protagonists in their breakthrough roles. The now deceased Ledger and Gyllenhaal were very good friends in real life, which visibly benefits their chemistry in the film. As individuals, they could hardly be more different. On the one hand, there is the introverted and taciturn cowboy Ennis, who gets to know himself better through his relationship with Jack, which he doesn't always like. He finds it difficult to show feelings and to fully engage with his co-cowboy. Jack, on the other hand, is a slightly eccentric rodeo rider, but also highly sensitive. He knows what he wants from the start and tries to make this clear to Ennis. However, his insecurity gets in the way of Jack's happiness, which is why his further path is rocky. Every time Ledger and Gyllenhaal share the screen together, there is a subtle but exuberant mood, laced with big emotions, feelings of happiness and a lot of frustration. The two give their all in these highly complex roles and deliver enormously human and passionate performances. In their separate, different lives, they are joined by strong female supporting roles. Michelle Williams as Ennis' wife Alma and Anne Hathaway as Jack's lover Laureen are also victims of a love that doesn't want to be, where Williams in particular acts very vulnerably.In addition to the performances, Ang Lee's grandiose direction deserves special mention. Brokeback Mountain inspires with beautiful landscape images from the mountains that reflect the emotional worlds of the protagonists. When they return to the Brokebacks together, everything is colourful and idyllic, while in their private lives in the city, much seems dark and dreary. This arty component puts its stamp on the film and sends important messages. The score is also beautiful and gives you constant goosebumps. As artistic and real as Brokeback Mountain is, it is definitely not light fare. The story of two men who love each other more than anything, but are prevented from doing so by society, is hard to watch. The ending is more than borderline. The closeness to reality is both the great strength and weakness of Brokeback Mountain. The brutality towards animals is also exaggerated, even if it was a sad matter of course in the world of cowboys. However, if you love films that do something to you, this is the one.",Brokeback Mountain

305,zactac,An Epic Love Story on the Same Level as Titanic,10,30 January 2014,"Every generation has that defining forbidden love story. For Shakespeare's time it was ""Romeo and Juliet,"" a story about two teenagers from different families but from the same world. ""Titanic"" is from the 90's and is also about two young people falling in love except this time they're both from very different worlds. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is the forbidden love story of our generation and this time both lovers are from the same world, sadly, that is the problem.The film focuses on two young cowboys in 1964, Ennis and Jack, who are working together for a summer herding sheep. During their time together they become close, so close they fall in love. Instead of living together they go their separate ways to live their own lives. They both get married, have children, and have decent jobs. However, they never forget each other and every chance they get, they get together on Brokeback Mountain to spend time together in anyway possible.I am one to openly state that I do not like western movies. I personally feel that the characters are unrelatable and stiff in western movies. And this is not just from watching one western, I have tried watching more than one an they all feel the same. However, I was completely engrossed in ""Brokeback Mountain."" This was a movie filled with fascinating characters and a story that made them as relatable as any real person. We have all been to a point in our lives where we fall for the person we know we can't have. The bad boy or the good girl, vice versa, and that is how they treat the characters in this film. Both of these men love each other wholeheartedly and there is a sense of melancholy surrounding their relationship because you know it will not end well for them. Watching them made me feel like I was watching ""Titanic"" again and that I was looking at this generation's Jack and Rose.Of course, this would not have been possible if it was not for the fantastic performances of the leading cast. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal gave some of the best performances of their careers in this movie. Heath Ledger was heartbreaking as the obviously distant and maybe even hollow Ennis. A man who detached himself so much it was as if he was not even alive. That is until he was around Jack (played wonderfully by Jake Gyllenhaal), then he would light up with such a joy you would believe this man had never experienced joy like this before. And of course Jake Gyllenhaal also gave an equally powerful performance as Jack. A man who was willing to give up everything for Ennis, risk his life and future because he was madly in love with him. Yet, this also makes him equally as tragic. A man who cannot hide his feelings as well as Ennis and ends up trying to be himself while holding onto the life he has now. This movie would not have been what it was without these two amazing actors. Such fascinating characters.In fact, I was so utterly fixated on their characters I (even though tragic love stories have taught me differently) was hoping that they would find a way to be together in the end. That they would find the happy-ending they deserved. And that is why it works. If a tragic love story does not make you hope the best for the couple in question then it is not doing it's job. Even though I've watched ""Titanic"" a hundred times, I root for Jack and Rose, I want them to find their happy ending because I am that invested in the main characters and their love story.I keep going back to ""Titanic"" because I feel that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is our generations ""Titanic."" We have ourselves one of the most beautifully told love stories in years that makes us root for them even though we know it will not end well. That is the beauty of this film. It makes us believe in true love while showing us that sometimes it isn't enough. Sometimes people need to change for love to live on.Also, I cannot forget the magnificent performances of the supporting cast. Michelle Williams gave a fantastic performance as the wife of Ennis. A woman who is definitely in love with Ennis but heartbroken by the truth of their relationship. The same can be said of Anne Hathaway and her riveting performance. She starts out as young woman in love with Jack but soon she realizes just how distant he really is from her. It is powerful to see her go from a young woman full of life to an older woman filled with bitterness. Both women are fascinating. And the filmmakers show us that it is not entirely anyone's fault when things fall apart. It's the fault of the fear of what's different, fear deep in a society.This is the type of movie that will open people's eyes to the truth about love: it is universal. It doesn't matter if the relationship is heterosexual or homosexual, love is the driving force in relationships. However, it is a reminder that society is the main force that can tear relationships apart. Whether it be because of social class, feuding families, or even whether it be of the same-sex. As a society, we must learn to accept love for what it is.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to find a great romantic film to watch. ""Brokeback Mountain"" gives one of the most honest portrayals of a homosexual relationship to ever hit the screen. With such an honest view it made the issue all the more universal and relatable. On that note alone I commend the fantastic team behind this wonderful movie. With wonderful performances, sensitive direction, and a beautifully written script; ""Brokeback Mountain"" soars to it's proper place among classics such as ""Titanic."" Bravo.",Brokeback Mountain
306,pookey56,exquisite force of nature,10,23 January 2006,"BBM is one of the most credible love stories' i have seen. taking it's time to build the relationship, nothing in this remarkable film felt contrived, or unbelievable. the mountains in the background i have seen and traveled on many times, and they are that beautiful. the cast,each of whom were so good their performances were mesmerizing, adapted screenplay, beautiful score and cinematography were heart-breakingly spectacular. no one made a false step, and it is by far the best film i have seen in a very long time. the film also held a few surprises for me: 1)the first physical love scene aroused me.2) the make-up aging of Jake and Heath was amazing.3) i don't want to be a cow boy or a cow girl. this is my problem. i have nothing against the cow boys and girls. i wont get in to why but let's just say they are a bit too anthropocentric for me.4) Anne Hathaway can play bitch, and play it well. 5)Michelle Williams can say more with her eyes than many of the best actors around.6) not much has changed since the start-time of BBM. this in itself is disheartening. for example, we just voted in a TROLL here in this beautiful country, where this film was made. this makes this film SIN, not love. the real sin here, is intolerance. this film is for adult audiences who enjoy great movies. the heartbreak of unfulfilled love, and the joys of it, are told better here than in any other film i've seen. i hope it sweeps the Oscars. and a shut-out in acting categories would be a travesty. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were brilliant. Not for one moment did i not believe that they were in love. is it better to walk away from love, and always ask what may have happened? or embrace it and risk hurting those who love you? i took that chance, an anguished, painful choice; and i'd do it again... but i did not have to risk being murdered for it. the greatest gift that humanity has is love. it didn't matter an iota whether this poignant love was between two men,two women, a man and a woman, or the love we have for any of our fellow creatures. love transcends all of that. this film embodies this essence. social intolerance is the true shame here.

307,middleburg,More than the Heart can bear,10,27 August 2006,"Throughout art, there have been countless stories and books, plays and movies about unrequited love. Some of the greatest stories and greatest works of art are about this very subject. And Brokeback Mountain enters this Pantheon of enduring love stories told with heart and beauty. The contrasts in Ang Lee's film are almost painful to have to deal with. The beauty of the scenery - skies so blue as to be dazzling in their intensity, mountain landscapes that are breathtaking in their grandeur - contrast with the heartbreaking poignancy of this sad, sad tale. The film consists of layer upon layer upon layer of emotion and meaning. The backdrop is beautiful. The pathetic nature of the lives of characters we grow to care so much about during the course of the film, are sometimes painful to watch. But then in the middle of these tragic story lines, there are moments of beauty and peace appearing like flowers suddenly blooming in the desert - Ennis' loving and loved daughters, Jack's humor, the strength of Alma and Lureen desperately trying to make their marriages work, Ennis opening up of his true feelings. The audience watches this life journey and is profoundly touched. We think we know what direction the movie might take at several times during the film, but then like life itself, the film veers off unexpectedly as fate and circumstance suddenly appear and the characters are forced to continually deal with life in all of its complexity - complexity of feelings, of situations, of inevitability, of both happiness and tragedy. The ending is genuinely emotionally charged. The culminating scene between Jack and Ennis where anger gives way to heartbreaking declarations of helplessness, and ruefulness at wasted time and wasted lives is simply devastating. The final scene with Ennis toasting his lovely, precious daughter, followed by that unbelievably tender final tableaux of Ennis, tears flooding his eyes, gently adjusting the photo of Brokeback Mountain is one of the most powerful scenes in recent American Cinema. For the audience, it is a moment that is almost more than the heart can bear. This is a classic film, and it will long endure as one of the most touching and profound films exploring the deepest recesses of our hearts.",Brokeback Mountain
308,ematerso,feel cheated,3,6 August 2006,"Given all the hype I expected a really great movie. It gets my 3 stars only because of gorgeous scenery. It was unrelentingly dreary, depressing and dull. Why did every character have to be a stereotype? From Jack's father to his big haired wife? Why was there no charm in any of the domestic interiors or interactions of the secondary characters? How did a postcard get stamped ""deceased"" How would the post office know that? Did the wife stamp it and send it back? Altho it was my understanding that Jack had been murdered by homophobes, the viewing of the scene was less clear. Could it not have been a fantasy in Ennis' head because of his childhood experience? Or if in fact a real murder why would the wife not have said so? Even in the 1980's a homosexual could not be murdered and there be no investigation which Ennis could easily have found out. There was absolutely no chemistry between the two characters of Jack and Ennis. This was my first introduction to Heath Ledger and it was an unfortunate one, his character and his looks, lack of ambition and callous treatment of his wife did not make him appealing (to me) to anyone of either sex. This was a very tedious film, it was sort of like jumping rocks in a stream, you just go from one year to the next with no purpose except to get to the other side. One reviewer did ask why Alma jr. wanted to live with her Dad. That she explained was because her Mom had a new baby and that is often a desire of children of divorced parents. . . to switch from one to the other. No, she did not know her Dad was in a gay relationship, but her Mother did and why she did not confront her husband but instead waved him off for yearly trysts seemed kind of unbelievable to me. This may have been a marvelous short story but it did not deserve the screen treatment it received. Either in length, execution, expression, acting or writing. Sometimes shorter really is better.",Brokeback Mountain
309,robtaday,A True Classic from the Word Go,10,7 November 2014,"I saw this film on its release and have seen it sporadically since. It is absolutely spellbinding. Both leads are magnificent. I, however, see the film less as an indictment of society against allowing homosexuals to ""be themselves"" as it is about confronting one's demons and coming to terms with them. It is no secret that men can and do love one another; best friends, etc. without engaging in sex. So what makes this film so tragic? I think in many ways it points to the fact that many times homosexuality is the easy way out. In other words, for men, the opposite sex can be a real drain: they have to be courted, wined and dined (if you will), and ""understood"" which is almost,if not totally impossible. However, two men (or two women for that matter,) can connect in a way that eliminates all of that protocol. Some men manage to have sex buddies of the same sex and can leave it at that. The problem, however, is that more often than not, one of them falls in love. It is a common phenomenon for ""the other woman"" as well in adulterous affairs. Some reviewers have tried to minimize the effect these characters' fathers (and mothers) had on their development but I don't think it can be minimized; I truly believe as with many homosexuals, the need for a strong male bond is so strong that they fall into homosexuality underscoring the need for fathers in todays' society to step up and BE role models. Mothers too. It is becoming more and more fashionable today to say that homosexuality is just fine, nothing to be ashamed of. I think though that as with Ennis in particular, it is something deep on the inside that tells you it is wrong, not society, in much the same way one would confront incestuous feelings toward say, one's sister. I really don't think intercourse was the foundation of their relationship. I don't think, for example that oral sex was something either of them engaged in with each other although they might let some OTHER guy do it to them (Jack in Mexico for example). When they both declare that they are not queer, I believe them. Jack is the one who seems to need sex more to validate the relationship which is kind of unfortunate for Ennis whom I think could take it or leave it and still love Jack with all of his heart. The film is a true work of art. A masterpiece even. Heath Ledger is astonishing, as is his vis-à-vis Jake G.",Brokeback Mountain

The way they try at individual lives, at individual relationships, and fail, only to come back got each other is that much purer. They have a connection, a need, to be with each other, to take brakes in themselves from lives they lead and don't enjoy. The actors do such a good job at conveying all of this. From the loneliness to the failed love. There are messages here, ones that should always be listened to. They speak of warning to fully arrange something like this should it appear in your life. To fully embrace it. The way it ends in tragedy is also adding to this, leaves one feeling sad and depressed.Everything about the way it is even made is one of quiet, one of always letting the viewer know of all of these things that are truly the essence of what two drifters in life, to loners are feeling on the inside.

It could have been between a guy and a girl, heck it could have been between a guy and one of the sheep (there were plenty enough). I like that the story is told sparingly and with restraint. What I've seen of Ang Lee is impressive. He's quite versatile (I've seen his period piece, Sense and Sensibility. I've seen his comedy, Wedding Banquet, I've seen his kung-fu movie, Crouching Tiger and his big-budget movie Hulk, and I've not always liked it, but he's always told it intelligently and a few times, he had the balls to risk trying something. There are a lot I haven't seen, Eat Drink Man Woman, Ride with the Devil and Ice Storm, and from their synopses these are all pretty diverse films too. I love Larry McMurtry, from his early stuff (Hud) to his fertile period (Terms of Endearment, Lonesome Dove, both the movies and the books) and I'm glad he's back. This is his first try at gay anything, and I think he's done it convincingly enough for me, but nobody does cowboy like McMurtry. Yeah, I'd recommend it.

In every way 'Brokeback' is a superior film; in every way it dwarfs all the other films of 2005; it's a brilliant achievement in timeless, enduring cinematic storytelling possessed of all the classical complexity and power of love tragically denied and self-denied and, ultimately, it ends with the beginning, the hope, of love redeemed.Ennis Del Mar - Ennis of the Sea - evolves, he changes for the better, he emerges, he moves from the inchoate, turgid soup of the sea to plant his feet on terra firma whence his love finds its roots and begins to branch out, to embrace his daughter's love for him and for her betrothed, and his love for them. Ennis holds onto, and the rest of his life's heartbeats depend from, the tragic talisman of his bloodied shirt, because it is his passport - and this enduring film's timeless, classical metaphor for tragedy - to the sublime which, in Jack's and his life, was not to be theirs.In twenty years time people will still be moved by, and they will continue to ache from and to love, 'Brokeback Mountain.'",Brokeback Mountain

317,bobbyelliott,Nothing happens,7,8 January 2006,"I'm not sure that there's much in this movie for the average straight guy. However, other demographics (including straight women) will enjoy it since it is, at heart, a simple love story. And ""simple"" is the operative word. The storyline is basic. Nothing happens. It plods along at a majestic pace with a brooding atmosphere - and nothing.Some people have said that the gay aspect of this movie is incidental - that it a love story between two people. But this film would have sunk without trace had it been about a man and a woman.The storyline is the problem. Great movies (""Shawshank Redemption"", ""American Beauty"" and Ang Lee's own ""The Ice Storm"") have great stories to tell. This one doesn't. Unless the fact that there are gay cowboys comes as news to you.But I don't want to be too critical of this movie. I enjoyed it. It's visually beautiful. The acting (especially by the two leads) is fantastic and the direction flawless. But if you put great ingredients into a pot and slow boil them for long enough then you'll end up with mush.",Brokeback Mountain
318,Len9876,"""Brokeback Mountain"": A Gay-Authentic Love Story",10,8 April 2012,"""Brokeback Mountain"" is more than a 'groundbreaker'. The story involves two men, who have more than an 'affinity' in them. They truly love each other, but an ignorant society and negative influences very divisively tries to break and separate them (discrimination, family influences, folkways, hostility, ignorance, inflexibility, mores, narrowness, norms, oppression, anti-gay parenting, perceptions, perspectives, prejudice, non-family relationships, repression, rigidity, standards, inner and outer struggles, upbringing, and etcetera). Negative influences, and not the men's love for each other, are what makes the film uncomfortable and unsettling. Like ""The Boys in the Band"", the film infuses stark reality, and takes audiences outside of their 'comfort zone'. But, it is love that legitimizes and validates a gay relationship. Negative influences can hamper, but not necessarily destroy, a gay relationship that is brought together in commitment, dedication, and love (unless those directly involved allow them to). Love transcends death, and it continues into infinity. Although physical presence is not perceived in death, faith, hope and love are the abstracts that render a relationship to become concrete. If you believe, nothing is impossible. In life, or in death.Some say that Heath Ledger is best remembered for ""The Joker"". That is not necessarily true. Others believe that he is best remembered for ""Brokeback Mountain"" and his sensitive, strong, anything-but-weak portrayal of a gay man who, sadly and unfortunately, believes that his gay relationship cannot be. No doubt the film was given an unhappy ending because of a belief that audiences would not accept two men (or two women) legitimately loving. Quoting an old saying, ""Oh what a web we weave, when we practice to deceive."" Remember that Hollywood is highly invested in making money. Conveying honesty or truth is not a prerequisite (example: in most 'cowboy and Indian' films, 'the white man' is rarely shown as 'the bad guy').If one uses critical analysis when viewing this film, the gay cognitions of two gay men and their highly-charged emotions in a harsh and judgmental environment, will be better understood. Outside of the two gay men, in this film, gayness is not even tolerated.",Brokeback Mountain
319,Knewsense78,These Marlboro Men Smoke More Than Just Cigarettes!!!,7,1 December 2006,"Well, after waiting awhile to watch this film, I finally have. Was it good? Yes. Was it great? No. Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar meet one year (1963) and herd sheep together. One thing leads to another and next thing you know, Jack is taking it from the back by Ennis. Why? I don't know. Nothing leading up to this moment indicated to me that they would be playing ""Rump Rangers"" any time soon. Oh well. That aside, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN does pound (no pun intended) home it's point about forbidden love for it's era. Though it's still not widely accepted now, it is more so than yesteryear. When Jack dies, it is powerful stuff. JAKE GYLENHAAL(?) does a good job as Jack Twist, the man who just can't ""quit"" Ennis, played by the equally good HEATH LEDGER. But the real wonder in this movie is MICHELLE WILLIAMS, absolutely wonderful as Ennis Del Mar's wife. After she see's Jack and Ennis kissing, her performance is truly stuff to rant about.",Brokeback Mountain
320,majic-5,Moving and beautiful,8,28 January 2006,"By now, everyone who hasn't been on the run from the US law enforcement has heard Brokeback Mountain summarized as ""the gay cowboy movie."" Indeed, I think that the most interesting question about the film, and its themes, is whether it appeals to people other than gays, lesbians, and extremely open-minded people. Given the film's limited distribution, the film's distributor, Focus Features, didn't think so. Based on my thoroughly informal survey of half a dozen people, I was surprised to find that the three heterosexuals who had to be persuaded to see the movie were quite moved. I think what resonates for most people is summarized by Ennis DelMar (Heath Ledger), about the frustration of having to have a covert relationship with Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal): ""If you can't fix it, you've got to stand it."" These two have to live a lie in their marriages, enduring relationships that feel fundamentally wrong to them, with only brief breaks for the only relationship where they feel at ease on the most basic level. It's being trapped in a way most of us can sympathize with, but never really know. Amazingly, Ledger reveals his torment to the audience without saying much, and mumbling a lot of what he says. His body language, his lack of ambition, and his self-imposed isolation all scream that this is a guy who has never gotten the nurturing he needs and who believes he never can. Gyllenhaal conveys his agony more verbally, but less affectingly. He tells Ennis that he and his wife might as well have their marriage over the phone, he gets all huffy and stomps around when Ennis tells him he has to skip a seasonal rendezvous, but he doesn't convey the same level of inner agony with his body, in his vocal shadings, or in his other relationships with nearly the same skill and conviction that Ledger does. The cinematography turns the beautiful and rugged Wyoming backcountry (shot in the Canadian Rockies in Alberta) into another character, alternately echoing the beauty and the hardship of the two men's love. It feels perfect as the place to forge a bond between two men who work in nature, as a retreat from the outside world, and as a harsh challenge simply for the men to survive.The women in this film, although they get far less screen time than the men, put in wonderful, nuanced performances. Michelle Williams, as Alma DelMar, hits just the right notes of shock mixed with shame when she figures out Ennis' secret. You can almost hear her rationalize to herself, ""well, at least it's not another woman"" as she tries to carry on with a regular family life. Her frustration with Ennis' ""fishing trips"" has a believably sharp edge that leaks out from her control, as she struggles to reconcile her duties as wife and mother with her unhappiness. She's developed enough as a character that when she finally leaves Ennis for a reason other than his continuing affair, she makes it eminently believable.Twist's wife, Lureen (Anne Hathaway), on the other hand, doesn't react so kindly, turning harder and more bitter as the years go by without the love she has the right to expect. From a spunky teen rodeo princess, she transforms bit by bit, into a brittle ice princess. By the time she finally talks to Ennis, you get the clear sense that there's a seething anger barely hidden below her polite veneer.Although the theme of frustrated and forbidden love as a backbreaking burden has wide appeal, what ultimately makes Brokeback Mountain special is that it explores its theme in an unconventional relationship with great depth and tenderness during a period of great controversy about same-sex relationships in this country. I hope that in 10 years, I can watch this film again and be just as moved.",Brokeback Mountain
321,jasonmichaeldickinson,Amazing,10,1 October 2021,This was an amazing movie I loved it very enjoyable story one of the best movies ever made.,Brokeback Mountain
322,arturus,Splendid,8,13 December 2005,"My partner and I saw this film together (something I recommend to everyone: see it with the one you love) and as we both grew up as gay men in the time portrayed, we know something of what these two were facing, in a time when other gay people were invisible and spoken about in whispers, if at all.This film is the best adaptation of a short story I've ever seen, expanding it without bloating it. It's beautifully photographed, the use of music and sound is very effective, the actors look and sound exactly as their characters should, and in the manner of the greats of the screen, like Tracy, Stewart and Fonda (and in the current time, Ed Harris and Kenneth Branagh) the two leads become their characters with utter simplicity and economy of means.The subject matter is handled unflinchingly, with no hiding and no cheap shots. The scenes of passion are awesomely done, some of the best (gay or straight) that I've seen on film: you can taste their longing and need for each other.I have two small quibbles with the screenplay as photographed. In Ms. Proulx's concisely written story, when Eannis and Jack are having sex for the first time, at the climax Jack says, ""Gun's going off."" That strikes me as perfectly in character and would have added much to the story as filmed. But he doesn't say that. Also, when they meet again after four years, embracing and kissing with passion and sheer relief at being together again, they pull apart and Ennis (accordinig to the author, ""not one for endearments"") using the phrase he says to his horse and daughters, says to Jack, ""Little darlin'"". That phrase humanizes their relationship, Ennis' character, and takes it all beyond sex to love. I waited with bated breath for the filmed character to say this line...but he doesn't! This accounts I think for the negative comments here from ""Christian"" viewers, that the film is only about lust, not love, thereby somehow proving that that is all a same sex relationship is, in their view. So why leave out this particular line? Did the producers think that a loving relationship was less acceptable to a general audience than a purely sexual one?I think the reason why the story this depicts is so relevant today is because the culture still does not support and provide equal rights for same-sex relationships. ""Heterosexual"" married men still feel they must lead secretly ""same-sex"" lives on the side, without their wives' knowledge. The findings of Kinsey more than fifty years ago are still true in 21st century America. I have known quite a number of these men in my time. This is unfair to them, to their wives and families, and to the other men involved. And, as depicted in this film, can lead to tragic circumstances, including suicide, murder and health issues.This film is a great achievement, deserving of every award it gets.",Brokeback Mountain
323,mpofarrell,One Of The Greatest American Movies Of The Past Quarter Century,10,29 January 2006,"From the pages of Annie Proulx's poignant, sparingly written short story screen writers Larry McMurtry and Diane Ossana have woven an epic love story for the screen and with director Ang Lee guiding a perfect cast have created in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN a motion picture that ranks with the great classics of the past. So much has already been written and discussed regarding this prematurely famous film that it seems superfluous at this point to add another comment. But what I find amazing about this film is its dichotomy: on the one hand there is all the current brouhaha concerning the screenplay's ""controversial"" subject matter. At the same time here is a movie that dutifully follows the pattern of good, old fashioned Hollywood -style film-making. The 20 year saga of Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, their passionate love thwarted by convention and bigotry is given the full throttle treatment by Ang Lee who dares to take the time to tell this story at a leisurely pace. The film's opening section is deliberately paced but never boring. And as we come to know the characters of Ennis and Jack and their time on Brokeback Mountain, the rest of the story becomes an emotional journey for the audience as well. Once off the mountain, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN gains momentum. If the film's longer second half veers into soap opera, as some critics have charged, then it is soap opera of the most riveting and utterly believable sort.Mere words cannot do justice to the performance Heath Ledger gives in this film. His Ennis is a man whose laconic nature barely hides the anger and passion just underneath the surface. I can't recall another performance where such inchoate feelings of love and loss have been so brilliantly rendered. The final minutes of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN are as heartrending as any you will see on the screen. Jake Gyllenhaal compliments Ledger's performance beautifully. His Jack is all feeling and frustration, a sweet-tempered man whose dream of sharing a life with Ennis is seemingly quashed at every turn.Technically labeled by some as a western and/or cowboy movie due to its setting, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is really a universal story. However, time (the early 1960s through the early 80s) and place are evoked so completely that one feels immersed in those Wyoming mountain pastures (actually filmed in Alberta ,Canada for the early scenes). As with every other aspect of this film, the cinematography is stunning. Clear mountain lakes mirror majestic skies and pines; a lone campfire, an orange dot on a mountainside, is nearly swallowed in the immense darkness of night; sheepherders guide their lambs, ewes, dogs and mules through vast mountain terrain, one particular shot photographed from what seems like a perch on the moon; small western towns; garish, neon-lit Country Western bars; a nighttime Fourth of July celebration and weathered ranch homes, barns and trailers are registered just as beautifully. This is a movie where grace and grit go hand in glove. Rodrigo Prieto's camera work is flawless.Ang Lee's achievement cannot be underestimated. He has pulled off an incredible hat trick in making a film that all audiences can relate to. No doubt there are many people who will resist going to see this film, but it will be their loss. BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is an ineffably sad tale : an elegy for dreams never achieved and roads not taken. It is an American masterpiece.",Brokeback Mountain
324,NewDivide1701,A truly moving movie of forbidden love.,8,22 May 2006,"Definitely a truly moving movie about forbidden love.This movie does and excellent job at portraying 2 men who fall in love with each other, and having to face a cruel world that isn't open to them. And even with their attempts to regain ""normal"" lives after their encounter at Brokeback Mountain, they always go back to each other when they felt true love.There is a reason why Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger were nominated for their performances, acting performance that is. They truly brought forth their characters. Ennis's (Ledger) reluctance and denial of his feelings, and Jack's (Gyllenhaal) willingness to be with his true love.And Ang Lee definitely deserves the Oscar for bringing forth love, betrayal and heartbreak to the screen. Especially the heartbreak that really brought forth the full emotion of the movie.Obviously the gay sex scenes would be too much for people who are very squeamish about the subject (dropping it from a 9 out of 10), but the rest of the movie is irresistible.No doubt as to why this movie was nominated for best picture, give Brokeback Mountain ...... 8.5 out of 10.",Brokeback Mountain
325,sullibrandon,A Beautiful Movie,9,19 February 2006,"I went to Brokeback Mountain feeling slightly apprehensive about the whole thing. I wasn't sure what to expect, and I wasn't sure if I'd like it, I just knew that a film that was garnering so much critical praise and public attention and controversy was a film that needed to be seen.I left the theatre feeling a mixture of anguish, praise for the movie, and half guilt for how homosexuals are treated in our world today.Now first, let me start by reviewing the movie itself, regardless of the fact that there are two gay cowboys in it. It was a breathtakingly beautiful film, I swear, every new view of Brokeback Mountain or the fields and forests surrounding it took my breath away with their encompassing grandeur. Excellent cinematography, unquestionably. Very very well done.The acting was quite a high point, as well. Jack Twist's and Ennis Del Mar's wives played their roles to perfection, Ennis's wive a confused soul when she finds out her husband is having an affair - with a gay man at that - and Jack's b****y wife who really couldn't give less of a darn that Jack sneaks away up to the mountains to go ""fishing"" several times a year. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall were the perfect choices for this film - and they both played their anguish so well I could almost physically feel the pain they were going through. The way they show the connection and love they have with each other is unbelievably good. The way the story seamlessly panned twenty years was very well done too. You could see a very clear difference in each of their characters between the beginning of the movie and the end of the movie.Now for the part about how the main characters are gay. I'm not really against gay people in general, but what I didn't like about the movie was the way the main characters cheated on their wives, and how it was presented as mostly acceptable, simply because they're in love. True, it would have been unbelievably difficult for them to not have an affair once they found out their feelings for each other, but the way their affair breaks Ennis's wife's heart broke my heart as well. The fact that the community around them would have most likely killed them if they found out, too, was another heartbreaking point in the movie, and how even Jack Twist himself is killed because people find out he is gay.On the whole, no matter who you are, this is a movie you should see. It is a heartbreaking, beautiful, painful, wonderfully acted and beautifully filmed masterpiece.",Brokeback Mountain

328,ierenz,What is truly distinctive about Brokeback Mountain is that it brings to life a love story,9,26 September 2019,"In Ang Lee's ""Sense and Sensibility,"" the characters never stopped talking. In his new film, ""Brokeback Mountain,"" they rarely start. Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) is a ranch hand who is hired, along with sometime Texas rodeo rider Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal), for a summer job herding sheep on Wyoming's Brokeback Mountain. They've never met before, and for a while, they communicate - or at least Ennis does - mostly through grunts and mumbles.Their closeness is that of the classic Westerner's - what is not spoken is more eloquent than that which is. But then the film takes a startling turn. On a cold night, Ennis and Jack lie together for warmth and then, suddenly, have sex.In most Westerns, the devotion between cowboys is depicted as deeper and more spiritually sustaining than the love between a man and a woman. ""Brokeback Mountain,"" which screenwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana expertly expanded from the celebrated 1997 short story by Annie Proulx, makes explicit the sexual undercurrent that, rightly or wrongly, not a few critics have at times detected in the intense masculine bonds of these strong, silent types.In this sense, as well as in the graphic nature of some of the sex scenes, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a zeitgeist-capturing moment for Hollywood. But, ultimately, its timing may well be a matter for the sociologists. As, too, will be the response from the general audience, which inevitably, and understandably, will be sharply divided. After all, nothing like this film has ever really been seen before from a major movie company. I'm referring not only to the film's sexual content here. What is truly distinctive about ""Brokeback Mountain"" is that it brings to life a love story that, after all these years of love stories, is essentially new to mainstream movies, and it does so without special pleading or sentimentality.Ennis and Jack come down off the mountain that summer not knowing if they will ever see each other again. They barely acknowledge what went on between them, and no future plans are made. But as Jack drives off, Ennis throws up. He can't comprehend the chasm that has opened up inside him.For the next 20 years, from the early 1960s to the late '70s, Ennis and Jack, both of whom become husbands and fathers, hook up for brief, intense getaways. Jack wants to leave his family for Ennis, who can only respond by saying, ""If you can't fix it, you gotta stand it.""He is the more emotionally armored of the two, and for much of the movie he is unable to acknowledge his passion for Jack. As his marriage to a good woman (the remarkable Michelle Williams) breaks up, his violent outbursts, which are really a form of self-abasement, become the only way he can act out his despair and bewilderment. Ang Lee is a remarkable humanist. He shows us not only the emotional damage that Jack and Ennis undergo but also the toll that is taken on their wives and children. No one is a villain, and no one is spared from sorrow.Gyllenhaal has a rare ability to bring out the youthful ardor in his characters without seeming callow. It is a gift that stands him in good stead because we must believe that the smitten Jack, over a period of two decades, is capable of sustaining a deepening passion. Ledger does something even more difficult: He gives us a full-scale portrait of a man who is so imprisoned by tradition and inhibition that he can never break out. Ledger's underplaying is a sign of grace. It is an acknowledgment that, for some men, there is pain too deep for words.Ennis, we are made to believe, is the Old West while Jack, who imagines they can have a life together, is a precursor of the New West. But both are in the wrong place at the wrong time. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a tragedy because these men have found something that many people, of whatever sexual persuasion, never find - true love. And they can't do anything about it.",Brokeback Mountain

The movie is based on a short story by E. Annie Proulx. I'm not familiar with it, but since this film was SOOO successful & acclaimed, I just decided to see it (Internet-wise). I didn't enjoy it. It was an below-average film. It can look like a good film; from a technical standpoint, it's pretty well done. But the plot is somewhat dull and the overall feel of the film is depressing.""Brokeback Mountain ""is a movie about a pair of teenage cowboys who perform a homosexual act during a time of prolonged seclusion from others (particularly from females). Afterwards, they part ways and marry beautiful, dedicated, and loving women. But four years later, their past comes to haunt them and destroys not only their lives but the innocent lives of their wives and children. Audiences witness the families torn asunder in waves of agonizing revelations, as the men continue to meet periodically, telling their wives they are going fishing. All the hype and glowing reviews from mostly LIBERAL & pro-gay media only came out about it because the story was about two men who had gay sex. That's it!There's nothing really remarkable about this film. It's not a love story and in fact it seems to be anti-love. After some days have passed on the mountain and some whiskey has been drunk, they suddenly and almost violently have sex; afterwards, they say ""It's a one-shot thing we got going on here,"" but it's FAR from that. Both the main characters betray their families & reject those who do love them.My only advice is, first off, never cognate ""gay marriage"" with ""interracial marriage""; a black person doesn't have to ""come out and tell people they're black."" LOL Second, watch some of Ang Lee's better films, such as ""Hulk"" (2003), or even ""Life of Pi"" (2012) - now that is a far superior work. To me, Brokeback DID NOT live up to the immense hype. Sorry but I just do not like it at all!

I waited. Then it went on ""3 for a week for a fiver"" and I rented it. Ang Lee did a great job there, not only in shooting a difficult story, but also with exceptional photography (it looks like an ad for a cigarette brand, but I don't remember which) and brilliant acting and bringing us back to the US in the 1960s.The story itself, about a secret love affair, is dealt with cleverly, and with qualities in the script, in the performance, and without cheap and easy voyeurism, which in itself is admirable of Ang Lee. Heterosexual love is the subject of so many films that directors lack practise in treating homosexual love, and with the controversy around Brokeback Mountain managing to get through the minefield was not easy. I felt a bit that only one of the two cowboys was in love with the other - but this is an opinion only, but most importantly it seems to me that Brokeback Mountain deals also with the eternal topic of forbidden love, and in that way manages to send the gay aspect of this love to the background",Brokeback Mountain

In the Dallas theatre where I saw the film, the audience actually applauded this scene for one of two reasons! Either because Jack told the ol' boy off, or the more likely reason: The switching off of a 1970s CFL Grey Cup game between the Edmonton Eskimos and Montreal Alouettes! (Canuck football on Texas TV? What's a Buckaroo to do?)The cowboy lovers keep each other going through some hellish personal circumstances and at great risk to their social well-being.

The passage of time that they spent together early in the movie was simply slow-moving (in fact the whole movie moved slowly) and then their first time together seemed to happen too fast and was overly violent.The script required them to get married to women, have children and then largely ignore their families in favor of their relationship. You feel bad for Ennis's wife when she sees the two men together; you can understand her shock but it all seems a little too by-the-numbers.One glaring issue that I spent too much time paying attention to was that the two men don't realistically age. Their children age and Anne Hathaway's wigs get bigger and poufier but apart from some hardly-noticeable wrinkles around their eyes, they don't seem to get older. Perhaps if a better makeup job was done, the audience would more feel the passage of years that they spent together.A touching movie might be made on this subject but I didn't feel that this was it.",Brokeback Mountain

""They're making a movie about what?"" Later, it lost the ""Best Picture"" Oscar because Hollywood was just too squeamish about the subject matter. Even Jake ""Jack Twist"" Gyllenhall himself made light of it during his Saturday Night Live hosting gig around the time of ""Brokeback's"" theater run.What exactly makes it great? For me, it's not just a touching romance story, but it's also a good period piece. The writing and production team captured the simpler, more black-and-white times leading from 1963 all the way through to the 80s where the story comes to a close.It's also an ensemble piece although at heart the story is about Jack and Ennis of course. There are Jack and Ennis' wives, their children, various in-laws, the gruff ranch owner played to perfection by Randy Quaid, and a couple of nice supporting turns by Linda Cardellini and Ana Faris, the former being a love interest for Ennis after his marriage dissolves, and the latter the wife of one of Jack Twist's rodeo pals.Speaking of rodeo, there are some nice sequences about mountain ranching, bull and wild bronco riding, and barrel racing. An item in the trivia section states Anne Hathaway learned how to barrel race for her role, yet a stunt double was used because of insurance reasons. These types of activities don't show up in movies every day, so in some ways ""Brokeback"" has some qualities of a sports western.The story is quite nuanced and has cumulative power because half of the writing team is the great Larry McMurtry. ""Brokeback"" shares a lot in common with other great McMurtry stories such as ""Last Picture Show,"" and ""Terms of Endearment,"" which are sprawling, epic takes set all or in part in Texas yet seem to be about EVERYTHING.The movie's final act contains several gut-wrenching, tearjerking scenes. You'd better have a box of tissues handy for this one, and if you've never seen it, what are you waiting for? ""Brokeback"" is definitely one of the best movies of the 2000s and appears on some ""100 best movie"" lists.",Brokeback Mountain

The local color is very authentic...all of it.Love develops between two young cowboys Jack and Ennis-- and the movie is about the trials of homosexual love in the 1960s and 70s. Yes, there was a little bit of gay fantasy window dressing...very handsome men using chew but nothing that is at all impossible-- in fact given the circumstances likely. Ennis an emotionally battered inexpressive man, is someone that it hard to believe Jack would stay in love with for 20 years...The ending is good Ennis living alone....having him remarry would have ruined it completely.RECOMMEND.",Brokeback Mountain

The others, of course, are racial, then ""religious,"" the latter ""fundamentalists"" constituting mankind's self-destruct today. Fear, of course, stimulates hatreds, which herein are outer-directed, foisted onto the perceived ""other."" I lay odds that within every homophobe there resides a closet queen. Or someone who fears ""he"" is. Second, on that assumption, the true ""hero"" of this tale is Jack, who had the balls to embrace his sexuality, and the ""victim"" is Ennis, who bought his father's fears and hatreds. And, in the cowardly purchase, sealed his own death-in-life, his final avowal of ""I swear to you, Jack,"" the epitaph far too late and totally inadequate. Authentic ""tragedy,"" in the classic Greek sense. That said, I, personally, found the film ""true"" and, ultimately, affecting.

340,elitt,Not Just a Gay Cowboy Movie,8,6 January 2006,"Ennis and Jack are two cowboys at the same paths of their lives. Both around the same age, come from crappy lifestyles, and not much to look forward to. They take a job working as sheepherders for a season and when the elements and boredom throw each other together, the two of them begin a homosexual relationship. What starts out as a lark turns into something more. For Jack, it's something that he probably has felt for a long time. For Ennis, it's a person showing him some love and companionship that he doesn't get enough from from his girl back home, who he in fact eventually marries. The two of them, after continuing their lives, begin a sordid affair of seasonal trips to the mountains where they had their first experience together. This goes on for years. The film takes place in 1963 Wyoming, where homosexual behavior isn't exactly encouraged. They keep it a secret and live their lives as if nothing happened, but they both know the one thing that keeps them going is their trips to Brokeback. The performances by Ennis (Heath Ledger)and Jack (Jake Gyllenhall) are terrific. Ledger is Australian, and you'd think he was born to play a cowboy. He seems to say more with his eyes than his voice as he tries very hard to hids his accent which he does a very good job doing. He's a very versatile actor. The movie tells a very poignant story. It's very slow moving, but I think it needed to move at a certain pace to tell their story right. Some of the scenes are a little rough and will make some feel uncomfortable. This isn't a movie you come out of the theater smiling and thinking how much you enjoyed it, but it is a very thought provoking film and extremely well acted and well written. As many refer to this film as the gay cowboy movie, I'd hope that people would give it a chance. It's really more than that and I believe tells a very poignant story. (***1/2)",Brokeback Mountain
341,maxmik,Oscars for everyone!,10,4 January 2006,"Oscars for acting, direction, screenplay, photography are all deserved. Also the set designs are crucial showing the lower class Ennis and the upper class Jack in their milieu. The music is good and if there is one criticism I have is that the actors do not age very well over the years. I don't know if this is the fault of the makeup or what but Ennis & Jack look pretty much the same throughout the movie. Knowing the cowboys in real life - they do not age very well and often become quite unattractive. But Heath & Jake look hot the whole time. I also thought Anne Hathaway was a hoot - she definitely changed over the length of the movie becoming blonder and blonder. This is a jewel of a movie - a miracle really - a classic love story - one that should last throughout time.",Brokeback Mountain
342,rchrdshelt,I've had a massive change of heart,10,1 July 2006,"Back in February when the Oscar race was heating up, I saw Crash and was blown away by it as written. However, I hadn't seen Brokeback Mountain and for that reason had a slight hope Crash might win. I honestly wish I had seen it back then. While I loved Crash, having seen this film today I can honestly say it was ten times better and deserved every award it received. I actually think its a crying shame and insult the Acadamy passed over this film and played it safe with Crash in a clear attempt to stay clear from controversy.Before seeing this film I had no problem with gay people in general or in society. Although I was not a person who was a strong believer in Gay rights, I did agree that a relationship between people of any sex is about people who love each other no matter what age, colour, race etc. and they should be free to express that in society. After seeing this film my views are stronger and I honestly was moved for the second time this week (having watched Once Upon a Time in America a few days before although Brokeback Mountain is even better.) Heath Ledger, Jake Gylenhall, Michelle Williams, Anne Hathway and many others turn in outstanding performances here, with Ledger and Gylenhall carrying the film. Their scenes at Brokeback Mountain and when they reunite throughout are some of the most powerful and emotional I've ever seen and I actually shed tears on several occasions. They heavily strengthened my belief from earlier further and I now strongly understand the torment and sadness many homosexual people suffer at the hands of many society's today. God bless all of you.The deepest thanks go to Ang Lee, the writer of the short story Anne Proulx and screenwriters Larry McMurty and Diana Ossana for forming this masterpiece. Also worthy of much recognition are the Oscar winning score and beautiful photography.A tremendous achievement and landmark in cinema history 10/10",Brokeback Mountain
343,Kryzak,"Haunting, Heartbreaking, and Powerful",10,11 December 2005,"First of all, I'd like to state that this movie transcends politics, religion, agendas, and even the mis-marketed ""gay cowboy"" tag-line. It is a movie about two people and their undeniable emotions for each other.With that said, I am still haunted (like many other viewers out there) by Brokeback Mountain a day after seeing it. Not too many movies moved me emotionally like this movie did. In case you were wondering, the other movies that affected me like this were Schindler's List, The Green Mile, and A Very Long Engagement. Let me break this movie down to it's basics: Direction: Ang Lee has crafted a masterpiece out of Brokeback Mountain. I've only seen ""1.5"" movies by him (Crouching Tiger and parts of The Wedding banquet) and wasn't super impressed. Now I thank him for making such an efficient, concise, and superbly directed movie. With the help of the screenplay writers, the pace of the movie was just right (maybe a little hurried in some spots), the cinematography was breathtaking, the emotions captured on film was brutally honest and powerful, and the story was faithfully adapted from Annie Proulx's short story. He deserves an Oscar nomination (or even win) for this effort.Acting: I've also never been impressed by Heath Ledger's resume in the past (A Knight's Tale, Four Feathers, etc...), but he simply shocked me with his performance in Brokeback Mountain. I never thought he could portray such nuanced and subtle emotions, through his accented mumbling (some people may need subtitles to understand what he's saying =P), than he did here. The fear and conflicting emotions that Heath's Ennis del Mar experiences were fully transferred to me watching in the audience. I've always enjoyed Jake Gyllenhaal's performances (Donnie Darko, Jarhead, and even Bubble Boy/Day After Tomorrow), and his Jack Twist was a perfect foil to Ennis. While many will argue that Jake's role was an ""easier"" one, I disagree with that conclusion. I believe Jake's character was just as complex because his Jack Twist had to be the perfect foil to Ennis. Jack's extroversion and playfulness balanced by an inner longing, sorrow, and frustration that was beautifully portrayed in this movie. Both of the lead characters deserve Oscar nominations for their performances and I will be watching out for their future films from now on. While many reviewers were impressed by Michelle William's Alma character, I thought it was good but nothing outstanding. Maybe I've seen too many ""suffering wife"" type characters or just wasn't drawn into her performance completely? I don't know. Anne Hathaway was definitely brilliant in the final telephone scene, and she played her character pretty well. Otherwise, the rest of the cast acted very well and the movie gel-ed together perfectly because of the supporting actors.All in all, I strongly recommend this movie for those of you who are willing to watch it with an open mind and no judgments. It is not a movie with an agenda and the story is brutally honest and powerful. Like many reviews already said, it's about two people who love each other, no matter their sex or sexuality. It's also about being honest with your emotions and showing the people you care about that you love them. This movie has earned a spot on my list of great movies, and I hope it will on yours too.",Brokeback Mountain
344,eyal philippsborn,A sadly-gay film,9,3 February 2006,"I'll be honest here, gay-kissing scenes make me squirm a little. I know that a relationship between any two people (as long as thy are consenting adults) is just as noble and worthy as the next and I despise all the hate ridden mongrels who proclaim ""God hates fagots"". I believe that if god hates humans, he hates those who are dispersing hatred, bigotry and narrow mindedness. I sincerely believe all those things. The problem is, no one had bothered to notify my stomach about it. If my stomach would have written the review, it would seem like a Jerry Falwell manifest. Thank god my stomach's only job these days is to make my jeans feel like spandex. In 1963, my stomach's opinions were pretty common. Gays were ridiculed and scorned. Those who were unfortunate enough to be recognized as gays were severely punished, not by the law but certainly without repercussions from law enforcers. 1963 was also the year that the lives of Anis del mar (Heath Ledger in a wonderful performance) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal in an equally great performance)were conjoined and altered forever. Anis and Jack were assigned to lead a herd of sheep for a week for mountain grazing. The two young men, each one with his aspirations and his southern roots deeply embedded in them, found in each other their soul mates.It goes without saying that in 1963 Wyoming (and let's face it, also everywhere in 2005) gay relationships were, to say the least, frowned upon and the two men had to build a life in the rural, southern states, start a family and go through the process that had no room for two gay man to materialize their love. Anis turned to the cattle business, Jack was a rodeo rider and later, a sleek salesman. Both living out the lives society deemed them to have.They also continued to see each other, having a clandestine affair where they basically, reenacted that week they spent together in the scenic location that the film bares its name. At some point, suspicion was bound to rise and that unfulfilled love and loveless marriages are never without a heavy toll. This toll is the recurring motive in the characters' lives and the thread that binds the movie.That thread is a subtle one, it reflects on the characters' weaknesses. Don't expect to find the ""Queer as folk"" plot lines, this movie is about regular people, not overly sensitive men, not inspiring visionaries, just two guys that fell in love with each other in time and place that left them very little chance to pursue their common personal aspirations.Unfortunately for the film, the same thread that makes it a subtle, atmosphere oriented feature is also the thread that stretches for 130 minutes that I (and not just my stomach) found to be partially redundant.Than it dawned on me. Jack and Anis, written, acted and directed almost flawlessly, are too dominant in the film. The supporting roles (Excellent performance all round, especially Michelle Williams and Anna Faris) were wrongfully remained a background setting while the ongoing endless struggle of Jack and Anis between their love and their obligations seems repetitive and is drained of new angles somewhere toward the end of the movie. In what the movie succeeds beyond expectations and will prompt me to evaluate it more now than I did when I exited the movie theater is the notion that keeps running in my head. Have we evolved since then? Oh, sure we all accept gay relationships, I have gay fiends and I couldn't care less who they choose as their life partners. We all heard of actors and performers living for a very long time with same-gender partners and we wink to each other and we genuinely know there is nothing morally wrong in this scenario. Where we made little progress, though is in our tendency to hush it, many times we rationalize that many people are still not openly gay by their will to avoid unnecessary hassle while secretly knowing that the gay issue remains uncomfortable. This movie, though low on plot and pacing and sometimes sluggishly dialogued, leaves a mark of impression and raises issues in 130 minutes screening that a generation of well mannered debates never managed to raise. The rarest of achievements.9.5 out of 10 in my FilmOmeter. p.s. It was today, 4/2/06, when a gay bar was smashed and brutalized by ignorant hate mongers. Those are still out there but that's not the reason why I bring this up. The reason is thee are many gay bars that are not the sign of progress but, rather, the indication of how little we changed since 1963. The straight bars are still not welcoming the gay community and those gay men and women have to wonder off on carefully marked, highly distinguished places that are nothing but the indication of how little our society had assimilated them. Unfortunately, not one movie, even this one, will make the difference.",Brokeback Mountain
345,QStrum,Good Film...Not the Best for 2005,6,10 January 2006,"This is a well-structured, simple story about two cowboys that engaged in a love affair that started during a job they had done together sheep-herding. After the job, the two lovers are forced back into their own individual lives, both in 1960's Midwest America, where their love affair would never be accepted. They had to pretend to be into their wives and have children while the true love they had was in each other, far away. Things become more complicated for one of the characters when his wife finds out about his intimacy with the other man.Brokeback explores homosexuality in ways never seen before ""by me"" on film. However, it's not as daring as people make it sound in it's exploration. In fact, I think it's overrated in that aspect. There have been dozens of Foreign films that took stabs at the subject matter of homosexuality. Most recently was ""Bad Education,"" which was a truly complex, multi-layered story that held no bars in it's telling. ""Bad"" had not only explored the prevalence of homosexuality, it also focused on the issues of the catholic church and the accusations against it involving sexual abuse against children.Ang Lee does a great job directing this film. The cinematography was first rate, with epic views of the mountains in Middle America. Lee did lose points from me in some moments when the film started to feel pretentious.Also, there were some holes in the screenplay. There were some things that were totally unclear, which was also very vital to the climax of this story (I can't give it away). At the end, I felt I had missed something that had me scratching my head, baffled. I also had trouble believing the beat for beat actions of Ledger's character when he related with his wife. It seemed absurd to believe that any man, straight or gay, would make himself look so obvious in his involvement in an extramarital affair. There were moments that even sunk to the level of ""Soap Opera"" as the truth about Ledger's character comes to light more and more. I never believed Jake's wife in the film. She seemed so cold and withdrawn, makes me question her involvement with what happens in the end because she didn't tell the truth about it when we find out. And if there was any involvement on her behalf, then why were we robbed of experiencing the progression of her change from loyalty to betrayal against Jake? The movie didn't fully work for me. I think Hollywood is unsure about the best film they had produced last year because there were too many bad and mediocre films. The critics are just happy to see a film that deal with homosexuality in such an intimate, realistic way that you rarely see from ""American"" films, straying away from stereotype and dealing with deeper issues of self-hate, self-deception and self-betrayal. It's not bold and nothing about it, for me, was memorable. Some originality in American Cinema? Yes (never seen gay cowboys on screen for so long in one film). Great performances? Absolutely. Best film of the year. No way.",Brokeback Mountain
346,tgrock,Underwhelming,6,27 August 2014,"The overall plot of the film is a great idea. However, it is just not well done.For the first 30 minutes of the film, the two main characters show no interest in each other sexually or emotionally, and the first love scene between them comes as a WTF? moment. If one were to not know the plot of the film, this would probably be a point where one would stop watching based on how laughably bad it is. However, the rest of the movie is pretty decent.The main problem with the film is that there is just too much to cover. We barely get to see the two characters' wives and how the two men's love affair takes a toll on them. The film just whizzes by through 19 years. It's like we barely get enough time to see the two main characters together during this time and barely enough time to see their lives away from one another. The film needed more focus.I do commend the acting of Heath Ledger here. After seeing his other roles, this one is a knock out just like his portrayal of The Joker.If you are looking for a better look at a homosexual man in the 1960's, I would suggest watching the first season of Masters of Sex instead of this.",Brokeback Mountain

It is griping and also quite devastating. The drama is intense, and the emotions are raw.If you have the patience to sit through a slow-moving romance and you lack the vanity to be put off by explicit cowboy on cowboy relations, you'll greatly appreciate the light at the end of Brokeback Mountain, a work of art that's more than just a movie.A superb romantic drama featuring solid performances, especially from Ledger, and excellent direction from Lee. The complexity of the relationships between various characters, including both physical and emotional, is one of the movie's strengths and also featuring some beautiful and fitting music. ---Yidioo",Brokeback Mountain

349,joseph952001,"With Apologies to Tony Bennett: ""I Lost My Heart, In Brokeback Mountain""",10,27 November 2006,"I'm a romantic! Always have been; always will be! This movie was aired for the first time on H.B.O. last night. Never saw the film, but heard a lot about it; mostly damaging, so I wasn't sure what I was expecting to see, but to my surprise, I was happy that I was lied to about what the film was really all about, but the problem with people seeing this movie is that you really have to be someone other than a city-slicker and have to love and appreciate the outdoors and nature! The scenery is spectacular. The story is very moving. The performances are incredibly honest. I wasn't sure how the end would come out, but it was one of those freak accidents that never can be explained leaving all those who loved the person beside themselves except for Jacks parents. It seems like they knew their son better than what most parents know their own son and was accepting of his life-style. They also knew who Heath was even though they had never met. This was apparent in Jacks father knowing where Brokeback Mountain was, and especially Jacks mother and how she related to Heath, and I'm willing to bet that the true ending to the story is that Heath later returns to Jacks parents and lives with them, and helps them with the farm until their dying day standing in for Jack as their second son! And this would complete Heaths love and respect for Jack! Betcha! So, after last nights airing, I have to say that I loved every minute, every second, and every foot of this classy film. How can, anyone, straight or gay, if they have any love in their hearts, not have compassion, and love, for these two men? But, when you come right down to it, how many men, and I'm sure there have been more than what we realize, found then selves moved because they, too, at one time, had been somewhat, in the same situation? But, and I know I'm going to be criticized for this, this is not a gay cowboy love story! These two men are not gay. It's true that circumstances being what it was in the mountains, no women around to have sex with; well, the inevitable happened and what started out to be a rape, turned out to be a love relationship that is hard to explain. What happened to them in the mountains caused them to become very much in love with a sexual relationship that was beyond gay, but even though that relationship continued on pass Jack's death, the two men were not gay! I don't know how to explain this any better. Even they both told each other that they were not queer! Maybe, I could say it was better than gay, that their relationship was more than gay! It was higher up the ladder! I'm sure that there is someone out there that knows what I'm trying to say when I say it was higher up the ladder than just being gay. It may have been a love relationship that many gay men would love to have but have never experienced! Anyway, this movie just tore me apart, and at the end when Willie Nelson, by the way one of my favorite performers, was singing, ""He Was A Friend Of Mine"", I just sat there overcome with a big large lump in my throat with tears pouring down my cheeks! Such an overwhelming, powerful, love story. Anyone who doesn't love this movie is a heartless, unloving, old Grumpy!",Brokeback Mountain
350,AndrewPhillips,A Masterpiece,10,17 January 2006,"Like a lot of reviewers I have felt compelled to write about this movie, something I have not done before. So why have I, well the acting is a career best for both the male leads, especially Heath Ledger, who I think found that defining role and excelled in it actually that's an understatement he was amazing. I also responded to the subtle approach, not being told when to cry, or in fact feel any emotion, just left to get on with it and decide for myself, how grown up, Ang Lee's master touch me thinks. It also made me think of that all consuming passion you experience every now and then in life, memories of which stay with you forever, powerful stuff. So go see it, you would be mad not too.

351,gus120970,The definitive film of homosexual love,10,9 January 2006,"I can only think Oscar approves. Wilde that is, who himself had a documented affection for western roughnecks. Because this is a film of great humanity and insight, told through a simple, gentle story, directed with artistry and restraint. I have such admiration for Ang Lee's versatility as a director, not only in his diverse choice of subject matter in his canon but also the balance of his craft in directing performance, scene composition and the telling of the story between the lines of dialogue as well as through them. The term 'masterpiece' seems ill-fitting for such an understated piece of work, but is there any other description that does it justice? It could quite easily not have been so, and I am sure many find it distasteful or even grotesque. There is a great compassion for all the characters that are affected by the love affair between the central characters, particularly Ennis' wife, played by Anne Hathaway. Heath Ledger' performance is revelatory, and both him and Gyllenhaal as Ennis and Jack depict brilliantly the span of a relationship from instinctive, guilty lust through to tender, hackneyed affection.You may or may not cry. But the film does not make a tawdry attempt to wring tears at any point, especially in the final act, when a final return to Brokeback Mountain could have been used to exploit all the previous dramatic tension (I can only think how Spielberg would have milked it).Like the stunning mountain that provides its backdrop, this film will stand the test of time, though it age and weather, to be admired in years to come.",Brokeback Mountain
352,ellagilbert-23101,devastating,9,24 February 2021,"I wouldn't describe this film as enjoyable to watch. It's slow and sad. But you will be absolutely immersed in Jack and Ennis's relationship.

353,Kalle_it,"Gimmicky ""masterpiece""",3,2 December 2009,"Had it been a man-woman love story, it would have been labeled as a boring and predictable TV-movie. But since it was about ""gay cowboys"", and the director was Ang Lee and not some random guy, Brokeback Mountain got the immediate Masterpiece status.Let me get this straight (pun intended): it's NOT a movie about homosexuality, coming out or same-sex relationship.The whole ""gay"" theme is an excuse, a gimmick if you will.Honestly, for being homosexuals, both Jack and Ennis did get more than enough (female) tail. Are we supposed to believe they could live a lie for 350 days a year, just being the real them in the one occasion they went ""fishing"" together? For all those years?Sorry, I don't buy it for one second.Brokeback Mountain uses the homosexuality like a promotional tool, while in the movie itself the issue almost gets treated like a secondary topic.Moreso: the sexual intercourse takes place early in the movie, so the cat is out of the bag when there's still plenty of time and the rest of the movie is devoted to a dragging and tiresome hide-and-seek game which has really no reason to be... They are attracted to each other, we KNOW that... And if that wasn't bad enough, the characters have a rather sloppy psychological evolution, if any.Since they pretty much pretended to be straight, getting married and having kids, the dramatic tension goes out of the window. Even the ""revelation"" to the wife is, at that point, sterile.I'll gracefully gloss over the melodramatic ending.So in the end Brokeback Mountain suffers from the typical ""much ado about nothing"" syndrome. The allegedly shocking topic gets treated in a very stereotypical way and doesn't even get developed like it could have been. The rest of the movie is visually pleasant, but too glossy. The acting ranges from overdriven to just fine, surely nowhere near Oscar material.My final impression was Ennis and Jack weren't more gay than J.D. and Turk from ""Scrubs""... It was just a very deep bond, with the occasional ""episode"" of homosexual intercourse. But hardly a revolutionary take on same-sex love.Those who hailed Brokeback Mountain as a milestone for the movie industry and as a milestone for homosexuality awareness either didn't watch the movie, or just wanted it to be so and didn't bother to actually see if it was the case or not.A wasted occasion, because the basic idea had so much potential. Too bad they took the cheap way.",Brokeback Mountain

It is great.Of all the great love stories that I have seen in movies and in plays, I can't think of a story that has spoken to me more intensely than Brokeback. Ever since rewatching it a few days ago, I have been playing back the scene when Jack says ""Sometimes I miss you so much that I can hardly stand it"" over and over again. It's just that good.Tragic. Tender. Terrifyingly beautiful. From the natural beauty of Wyoming to its rural poverty, the American West has never seemed more full of brutality or love.One of the great love stories of our time, Brokeback should be relevant for far more than the ""gay cowboy"" closet.(I have seen this several times, most recently on June 22, 2017)",Brokeback Mountain
356,johnmichael-2,I finally got it right,10,14 January 2010,"This is my third go at reviewing this film. It came after rewatching it, and now I finally get it.This is a masterpiece. This is Ang Lee's best film, and he has made many good films. This is 2005's best films and one of the best of the decade. It is probably the most socially significant American movie of the decade.I admit, though, that the first time I saw it, I didn't like it. It wasn't that I was expecting too much from it, but that I was expecting the wrong things. I expected it to be more sensational than it was. At the same time, I didn't understand the characters' positions, sexually and socially, as I am able to now. So I said it seemed ""off,"" and that it was too long and slow.I take it all back. This film is perfect. It is an intense gay romance, and yet it really holds back in what it shows us. The sex scenes are not graphic, the story is not ""pro-gay,"" and political/social agendas seem to be absent. In fact, the film does not concern itself with the gay agenda at all. It is invested in its characters, who happen to be gay and in love with each other. And this makes the movie a hundred times more of a knockout than it would ever be if it climbed upon a platform and spewed hate messages against homophobes.The performances are perfect. Everyone deserved their nominations, and Anne Hathaway was robbed when she was the only one of the four main stars left out of the Oscar pool.

A movie like this is about love and friendship, universal traits that are sorely lacking in the world today.",Brokeback Mountain

A lot of this was the thin premise of the story. Two cowboys thrown together in lonely circumstances begin a sort of sexual relationship but, because of their lives and situation at the time (the sixties) have to continue their love secretly. For me it was a very disappointing film, although very well acted by all the actors, I genuinely felt it wasn't going anywhere and after half an hour, felt it could have been a shorter movie.I'm not even sure it did that much for the gay rights movement in America, either. After all, neither actor was overtly gay either in their scenes together or in real life. Heath Ledger was the strong, very silent type and Jack Gyllenhaal, an actor who was more at home playing this sort of role, was quite likable.",Brokeback Mountain

It might even be the worst film of the decade.I hardly ever walk out of films, but I had to walk out of this half way through. Watching paint dry would be more exciting.It is a complete con. Not only are the cowboys not homosexual (they just f uck each other out of boredom - it is odd that the audience didn't do the same, really) but they aren't cowboys, they're sheep herders. There is hardly any dialogue and what there is is utterly unconvincing. The acting could be done as well by tailor's dummies.I'm not really sure if I should say more about how bad it is because it might make you think that it is one of those films that are so bad that they are funny. Nope. This one is the utter dregs of film making - I seriously thought of asking for my money back.I'm cross.

This film forces us to look at our own culture's ruthless and even vicious hatred of gay men, how we force them to conform to a mold that does not suit them, how they are pressured into marriages that they do not want, and how we discard them like dirty toilet paper when they express their true selves. It might be said that gay men are the only gifts from God that we despise. For without the love of man for other men, the world would have long before dissolved into endless hatred and pride. Annie Proulx, who moved to Wyoming late in her career, was deeply touched to discover these ""deuces,"" who struggle even in Wyoming to express themselves as intended. And, here too, they only encounter endless hostility from the straight culture. Heath is convincing as the poor subsistence ranch worker who falls in love with Jake Gyllenhaal's rodeo rider character. The beauty of the Wyoming scenery matches the beauty of the frustrated, but quite real, love between these two tragic ""deuces.""I await eagerly ""Brokeback Mountain: The Lovers Return.""",Brokeback Mountain
361,pseawrig,"stark, haunting strength",10,22 December 2005,"Some of you may be thinking of avoiding this film because of its same-sex subject matter. That would be a shame, as this is an unusually smart and poignant love story, one that earnestly and candidly asks questions about life's purpose and our duties to each other and ourselves.Two hard-scrabble young men share the summer of 1963 herding sheep in the American west. One, Jack, is brash, energetic, and talkative, innocently seeking attention and camaraderie. He wants more from life. The other, Ennis, is less confident. In fact, he is stoic to the point of being nonverbal. Ennis has been bred to endure a life filled with silences, tedium, and loneliness, without imagining the possibility of more. This will change. Except for their shared work, which is hard and numbing, Jack and Ennis seem to have little in common,One night, Jack and Ennis's physical horse play turns sexual, maybe out of loneliness, maybe out of boredom. The film remains purposely vague on this point, refusing to know more about this encounter than do its lead characters. Afterwards, Jack and Ennis . . . especially Ennis . . . contend with guilt feelings, but return to each other's bodies with renewed sexual vigor. At summer's end, these otherwise seemingly straight men have become caught up in feelings that transcend physical attraction, feelings which they acknowledge, but are unable to shape, categorize, or really even understand.Herein lies this film's stark, haunting strength: from start to finish, it does not pretend to understand Jack and Ennis's feelings for each other any more than they do. Instead, it recounts their clandestine and intermittent meetings on Brokeback Mountain with an unflinching eye and a raw soul. Every sensual tool of the cinema ensures that we feel the pleasures and relentless demands of these men's sexual attraction. Meawhile, nuanced and not-so-nuanced elements of dramatic structure show the problems their attraction brings, the damage it does, and the violence it elicits. All the while, the film maintains a strangely languorous pace . . . as if each scene were inevitably flowing from the previous one according to fate's dispassionate cadence.Brokeback Mountain quietly celebrates the love it reveals, itself a welcome achievement. Still, it does so much more. It contemplates this love. It stands in awe of its power to infuse even the meanest of lives with depth, beauty, and meaning, even when . . . or perhaps especially when . . . that meaning proves tragic. The film reaches emotional heights by artfully asking how sexuality, privilege, historical accident, and personal responsibility determine the opportunities we find and the choices we make in life. It achieves epic grandeur by refusing to resolve these questions with easy answers or familiar slogans.This film is not a happy story, but neither is it completely sad. It is sublimely beautiful and a startlingly significant American film.",Brokeback Mountain

This story is about more than gay lovers, it is about passion, love, responsibility, wide open spaces and those curves that life throws at us. I am surprised at the number of men refusing to see it, I think many of them would profit from watching this film and then talking about it.

I just watched this movie for the first time, and I can see how this movie gained such hype back in 2005.The plot follows 2 cowboys-Jack and Ennis(Jake Gyllenhall and Heath Ledger, respectively), who meet after taking a summer job as shepherds. Despite denying their homosexuality at first, they have sex together one night. Time passes, and they move on.They get married and have kids- but still meet up a few times a year to see each other. They realize they are in love and can't live without each other. ""I wish I knew how to quit you"", Jack famously says.From a filmmaking perspective, Brokeback Mountain is visually beautiful, particularly when the cowboys were in the mountains. Jake and Heath are also amazing in their brave roles as a gay couple. As far as BM is as a movie, it also grabbed my interest throughout and was well paced.Before I give my single criticism of the movie, let me be frank about something: I believe homosexuality is a sin- that said, I'm not against gay people if that makes sense. They still deserve the same respect as straight people.I do NOT have a problem with Brokeback Mountain being about a homosexual romance. I knew that was the premise going in. Complaining that this was about gay cowboys would be as ridiclous as complaining that The Godfather was about the mafia.My issue is with the 2nd half- they don't just visit each other while married(that would have been fine with me), but they continue having sex with each other. The gay relationship was one thing, it turning into infidelity was another. I would have had the same issue had the plot been about a heterosexual couple.They don't have any backlash for it either, other than one of them getting divorced, which the man practically celebrates. (By the way, the wife sees them kiss passionately when they meet for the first time in years, and she rightfully gets jealous, but remains married to the man for years- why would she do that?)Anyways, despite that bothersome aspect that the movie could have gone without, Brokeback Mountain was still a wonderful movie and it was indeed very brave and well made. If you can overlook the cheating aspect, BM is well worth your time. You definitely don't want to quit this film.",Brokeback Mountain
364,brodie_kashmir,"Strong performances propel this ""average"" love story, but still over-hyped",7,10 July 2006,"Most of the end of the year praise is thrust upon Brokeback Mountain. A love story centering on the secret 20 year relationship between two cowboys, Brokeback Mountain doesn't really deserve all of that praise.Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger play Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar, two ranch hand cowboys in 1963 rural Wyoming. Their job is to spend four months in the mountains herding sheep. They find, well, let's just say ""an interesting"" way to pass the time. They know they shouldn't, but they do anyway, neither one admitting they're gay. They spend the next 20 years meeting in private every couple of months putting a strain on their relationship with each other and with their wives.The movie isn't a ""gay"" movie. It's a love story. A romance. Larry David (""Seinfeld"", ""Curb Your Enthusiasm"") wrote a satirical article, I believe for the New York Times, about the movie making him question his sexuality (remember, it's a satirical article). It doesn't It won't make you gay to watch it.But as a love story, it seems pretty standard. If you look at it as that, as a love story, leaving the whole ""gay"" thing aside, then it's pretty standard. The Notebook was way better as a love story. I honestly think that the only reason it's getting all the praise is because instead of a man and a woman, it's two men. If it was a man and a woman, no one would look twice at this film.Heath Ledger deserves a lot of the attention he's getting. He did very well and is certainly a contender for Best Actor. His soulful portrayal of the eternally conflicted Ennis Del Mar. He's completely in love with Jack, and he's able to accept that. But he doesn't think of himself as gay. It makes for a very compelling character.Jake Gyllenhaal does well as Jack, who is more accepting of his lifestyle than Ennis is, though he doesn't come without his own struggles. While he is more accepting of his lifestyle, he still has to hide it from his wife and everyone else. And that just tears him up. You can see the strain on Jake/Jack's face in the climactic argument, and that proves why Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the top young actors.The supporting cast is populated by teen queen pin up girls, and they actually get to show off their acting chops. Anne Hathaway as the distant wife of Jack gets high marks for expertly stretching her range out of Disney Princess films and finally playing a character with depth. Michelle Williams leaves Dawson's Creek behind, and comes into her own as Ennis' long suffering wife. I'm thinking a Best Supporting Actress nomination is in her future. ER's Linda Cardellini gets to shine in her brief stint as Ennis' new and then ex-girlfriend.Ang Lee's direction at least makes up for The Hulk. Was it anything spectacular? Not really. Like I said earlier, it was pretty standard. Nothing spectacular, though the production designer should get a nomination or two for finding some beautiful Western locations to shoot at, and the cinematographer should get some recognition for capturing them.The script and story, except for it being two men, was just a love story, an average love story.The real saving grace were the fantastic performances",Brokeback Mountain
365,silva-w-pius,a master piece that should be celebrated,8,11 August 2013,"It makes cowboys cool again, breathing warmth into archaic notions of not only cowboys but also stereotypes of masculinity and what it means to be a man, saying to all that watch that it's okay to possess emotion and actually have feelings, but to still be considered a man. I personally felt it was a beautifully sculpted, film art work that provides us with a brave and heart wrenching exploration into forbidden love, which evokes every emotion from all over the rainbow, making it almost impossible not to fall in love with the two main characters, almost at the same time as the two main characters fall in love with each other. An Ang lee (Life of Pie) film tells the story of two cowboys, -Jake Gyllenhall (Zodiac, Jarhead and Donnie Darko), and Heath Ledger (Oscar for best supporting actor in his role in The Dark Knight). Who meet and fall for each other on the Wyoming landscape. But due to the nature of this relationship, it's a love that is wrongfully hidden from the world. Also featuring supporting actresses Anne Hathaway (Les Misérables), Michele Williams (Great Gatsby) and Kate Mara (We Are Marshall) to name a few, who play their parts well, to ensure this film becomes a classic. It's a massive complement to our hearts and minds, that Ang lee pays us as the audience, providing us with a story that brings the LGBT community to not just too mainstream cinema, but to our homes and our hearts.

367,johnnysugar,Gay cowboys eating pudding,3,29 December 2005,"WARNING! THIS REVIEW CONTAINS NUMEROUS SPOILERS! ""Catwoman."" ""Xandau."" ""The Apple."" ""Pootie Tang."" What do all of these films have in common? They're all about as entertaining as ""Brokeback Mountain"", a lead balloon of a message movie undone by its own good intentions and its own sense of cinematic entitlement.Based on the short story by Annie Proulx, ""Brokeback"" concerns two ranch-hands, the improbably named Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger), who meet as young men while both are sheep-herding on Wyoming's Brokeback Mountain. The two develop a close relationship, culminating in a fumbling night of intimacy during a cold snap. After their job ends, the two part ways, each marrying a woman and fathering children: Jack marries well-to-do rodeo girl Lureen (Anne Hathaway) while Ennis marries down-to-earth Alma (Michelle Williams). Both men, however, continue to hold onto their memories of Brokeback, until the day they finally meet again and begin a secret relationship thinly disguised as a series of fishing trips. The film chronicles the two men as their secret slowly destroys their marriages and threatens to consume them from within. Much angst ensues.""Brokeback"" is a film of substitutions: a collection of mannerisms substituting for characterization, a series of landscape shots substituting for direction, an assemblage of country-fried aphorisms substituting for a script, rampant and unrestrained melodrama substituting for human emotion. The largest share of the blame for the film lies with director Ang Lee, a man who could probably make very vivid wilderness films but who rarely knows what to do with the humans caught in his frame. Lee's direction is ridiculously dull and ponderous, each scene moving with a slow, aimless gait into the next with no forward momentum or dramatic pull. To be sure, some of Lee's footage is gorgeous even while its lack of realism proves distracting: the moon over Wyoming is always big and full, the top of the mountain is always pristine, and the small towns of the film are always picture-perfect in aping what Lee believes they should look like. Diana Ossana and Larry McMurty's script doesn't help matters at all. The words don't so much advance the ""plot"", for lack of a better word, as much as they intermittently nudge it down a lazy river.But that doesn't leave the actors in the clear. Much attention has been paid to the two male leads, especially Ledger, for their performances, but the praise comes not so much from the performances themselves as from what they represent. Like Charlize Theron in ""Monster"", few critics believed Ledger was capable of performing such a role, while both men are seen as ""bold"" or ""daring"" for playing ostensibly gay men. The caliber of the performances no longer matters at this point: the quickest way to an Oscar nomination is to play gay, handicapped, or a prostitute. But the praise is misplaced. Certainly, both men are giving heartfelt performances, and both fully believe in the film, but Ledger decides to mumble most of his words to the point of making half of his lines unintelligible, while Gyllenhaal comes off simply as trying to act too much. He's endearingly artificial. The only characters who appear as natural, genuine human beings are the two female leads. Williams has a few very difficult, emotionally raw scenes that she pulls off remarkably well. Hathaway is better-than-expected as a woman who decides to drown her marital ennui in a Tammy Faye-esquire swirl of bleached hair, gaudy jewelry, and taloned fingernails.The argument has been advanced, and never more enthusiastically than by the producers of the film, that this is not a ""gay cowboy movie"", but a ""universal"" love story. But this is not a ""gay"" movie. Jack and Ennis never identify as gay or consider themselves to be gay men. None of the lead actors are gay. None of the main talent behind the scenes is gay. This is a film by, to, and packaged for self-gratifying heterosexuals, brimming with a well-intentioned but ultimately patronizing, stultifying view of gays and their relationships that typifies the Hollywood penchant for sacrificing structure, story, and quality in order to advance a viewpoint that the filmmakers have little (if any) familiarity with. I should point out at this time that I am a gay man, but the attitude presented in Brokeback insults me. Jack and Ennis' relationship is presented as the purest of all the relationships between all of the characters of the film, despite the fact that the word ""love"" never escapes their lips once during the film. Anyone who criticizes them for any reason is automatically a bigot, even as the two men's selfishness not only brings misery and unhappiness to both their families, but ultimately proves to be their undoing. Jack, while desperately seeking the constant companionship Ennis denies him, is gay-bashed to death, graphically, with a tire iron to his face. Sadly, it is the only appropriate end for this antiquated, ""Children's Hour""-style take on those quaint little homosexuals. On the other hand, given the amount of effort everyone involved in the film has put into making all of these characters so uniformly miserable, a happy ending would have been ludicrously fake.30 seconds of poorly-filmed sex and a few make-out sessions is not enough to call yourself a ""bold"" or ""courageous"" film. The fact that this is essentially a Harlequin-style doomed romance that happens to feature two men in the leading roles doesn't excuse the horde of clichés marching across the screen. Perhaps I'm old-fashioned, but I firmly believe that just because you want your movie to be important doesn't mean you have to make it skull-crushingly boring.On an episode of South Park, Eric Cartman states that all independent cinema consists of is ""gay cowboys eating pudding.""

During the job they become closer and closer friends until their relationship turns intimate. Even though they both care about each other, neither feels completely comfortable living a gay lifestyle and must attempt to sort through feelings they don't fully understand.Brokeback Mountain is a beautiful film not only in the flawless cinematography of the sweeping landscapes but in the many deep and heartfelt emotions that are being dealt with. This is without a doubt one of the best romantic movies ever made, it just happens to be about two men instead of a man and a woman.The truly amazing thing is that it has a much more universal appeal to audiences than many conventional romances. Brokeback Mountain deals with relationships with friends, lovers, family as well as the idea of living of lie. Many people, gay and straight, feel as if they aren't really living the life they want and this movie captures the detrimental effect that can have. It also deals with feeling that you can't connect with anyone and you are alone in the world.All this aside, the best aspect of Brokeback Mountain would have to be the acting. Jake Gyllenhaal is excellent, but Heath Ledger's portrayal of Ennis Del Mar is just on another level. He embodies the role like very few actors can; every line, every look he delivers just exudes pain.Brokeback Mountain isn't just a romance and certainly isn't just a ""gay cowboy"" movie. Brokeback Mountain is a movie that transverses the entire emotional spectrum and studies the human condition.

Somebody made a gay western with two mainstream Hollywood actors in it. First you think they've gone nuts. That it's probably going to end their careers faster than a first-rate video game stinker, ala Street Fighter. I guess at some point anybody that approximately knew what the film was about either thought it'll get bashed and laughed at, or that it'll be somehow ignored and quickly forgotten by the general audience. Meaining that it's just going to be another mediocre socio-drama. Now that the word 'Brokeback' is (so I read) the most frequently said and searched word when it comes to movies of 2005, the last thesis seems to be just plain old dumb. Meaning that the movie wasn't by any chance ignored by the general audience, nor forgotten by that matter.No, it was more or less ignored by a well-known, some would say the most credible institution in the world of motion pictures. At least on the points I find to be most deserving. Brokeback Mountain, really is something new in many viewpoints. It's hardly the second Ang Lee's film I've seen so far. The first one was The Ice Storm. He really seems to have many talent in the point of depicting the microcosms of society. Families and individuals.This time he sends us to the middle of nowhere to confront us with one of the most disagreeable subjects. In the middle he puts two ordinary, lower-middle class men who just want to make some decent money. Lonely, wistful and kind of bored they become very close and one night they do something for which they both claim to be just a 'one-shot thing'. After their painful split, they go on with their lives as if nothing happened. All this time they feel forced by society and obliged by their families to hide an important part of their love-lives. So they do. And this is what the movie is best at. In showing how people want something so badly and yet they hate it and reject it because they want to look 'normal' in front of everybody. They're well aware that they most likely wont receive a shred of understanding from anyone. 'Brokeback' can become a hated and misunderstood film if watched under the influence of prejudice. A part of the male audience will feel very unsettled and provoked by the hair-splitting depiction of the two 'family men'. So before seeing it, 'preparing' yourself wouldn't be such a bad idea. You will enjoy it and even understand it a lot more if you try to be a bit open-minded. To me it's not a 'gay movie'. It's a vibrant statement about a society that lauds ideals and who's individuals are completely unwilling to except something they are unable to determine.

Character development was spot on. It's been a while since I actually FELT the passion that was emitted on screen.

372,gurghi-2,A beautiful lie,5,22 January 2006,"Great acting, grand scenery, good writing. A sure lock for Best Picture, and a significant event in movie history. These, and more, I grant Brokeback Mountain. What I want to get at, though, is why I am not joining its legion of revelers. I do not, as so many here, flatter myself for my tolerance and fall all over myself to laud it.Clearly, many find the film deeply moving and identify strongly with its characters and with the dilemma at its heart. We may further debate its merits and discuss its implications, and I applaud the movie for engendering thoughtful conversation about, and consideration of, sexuality and society. It deserves more than mere approval or dismissal. But in reviewing it, I cannot avoid the central conceit. So I'll cut to the chase:The relationship never moves beyond its passionate beginnings. Even if we assume that it could have if given the chance, it's an empty dream. Jack tells Ennis, ""It could always be like this,"" but that is clearly a delusion; what were for them the halcyon days of Brokeback Mountain cannot be repeated, much less lived indefinitely. No mature couple, be they gay or straight, can remain as they were at the start. Singularity— an existence apart, seemingly, from obligation and constraint —is, it is clear, integral to the appeal of any illicit affair. We may blame society, fault forces beyond their control that two men in love cannot freely pursue, and allow to develop, their passion. But the movie also asks us to lament that Jack and Ennis never get to return, metaphorically, to Brokeback Mountain— when that haven doesn't really exist at all. It is a constant challenge to live with lasting connection, keep promises, and choose the welfare of others over one's own. To do so is also frequently incompatible with, but ultimately more rewarding than, the pursuit of one's own gratification. Jack and Ennis repeatedly deceive their loved ones— including each other —and selfishly chase after their own fulfillment, and yet the movie has less sympathy for their responsibilities as employees, husbands, and fathers than it does for their affair.I believe that their affair is immoral, and would be still if between a man and a woman (of course, in that case it wouldn't be as notable a movie). While I sympathized with the characters and admired the artistry of the film, I am not moved to mourn the consequences of romantic folly. (For this reason, I also find movies like The Bridges of Madison County, The English Patient, and Titanic fundamentally flawed. ) Romance and sex are not the only components of love.Brokeback Mountain shows the futility of life lived in denial and deception, but assumes that embracing and affirming one's passion is by definition, if not without consequence, more laudable than obligation and restraint. That's an assumption I don't share.",Brokeback Mountain
373,magicsinglez,"One gay, anti-gay movie",8,28 June 2007,"Heath Ledger, as Ennis, is really on fire in this movie. Reviving the role of the romantic leading man. He, truly, becomes a sex symbol in Brokeback Mountain, and in his own way, with his warm relationship with his daughter, a symbol of how to become a good father. If anything 'Brokeback' is the promotion of hetero sexuality. Ledger is like a very cute, very hard working, very sexy Clint Eastwood.Ledger is really amazing and Brokeback is a beautifully filmed movie. It is also patently anti-gay. From the first words spoken in the film. . . ""You pair of deuces lookin' for work, I suggest you get your scrawny asses in here pronto"", to the final credits. The first scene, I think, where I kind of noticed there was an anti-gay theme going on in the background (I was mostly just watching and enjoying the film), was when Ennis and Jack are embracing, and then the film quickly, purposefully, cuts back to showing their wives and children back at home.Late in the film, Ennis says, lost in thought, "". . . Up on Brokeback mountain"", and I realized, he's not referring to the mountain. . . he's referring to their relationship. As he said the words, and I realized what he was really talking about, I kind of felt bad for them, shame for them, perhaps I was, amused, by them. . .When we see Jack with his new boyfriend. . . there's really no indication the two are together, yet, I just knew what the deal was. While I may have found this realization to be amusing, too, one reviewer observed, there was some actual laughter among the young audience (particularly at the fooled wives). No one was laughing at the end. During Thanksgiving, Jack, his wife and their kids, and Jack's mother and father in-law, are all at the kitchen table. Jacks father in-law's standing up and carving the Turkey. Jack turns off the ball-game playing on TV in the next room. His father in-law makes a comment then turns the game back on. Jack gets up and turns it off again. When his father in law goes to turn the game back on, Jack yells something like, ""Sit down you old Jerk!"", and he finds himself, without realizing it, standing over the Turkey beginning the chore. Jack has become the man of the house. This is the point in the movie the audience is expected to cheer. When Jack died. . . Was he really killed by accident, by the rim of a car tire, or was he beaten to death, like the vision that appeared throughout the movie, for being gay? I believe he did die in the accident, and the accident sounded unpleasant, not something that I would want to see happen to anyone. But I agree with other reviewers who say what really happened is left open to interpretation. In fact, near the end, for just a moment, I couldn't believe what I was watching. . . Is the film encouraging us to violence here? It was definitely open to interpretation. For just a moment, I couldn't believe my eyes. . .If this, is, what the film is suggesting we think about. . . it makes me wonder. . . what kind of other crazy things might people be walking around thinking every day? What else might people be thinking, but not saying?Frantz Fanon observes, ""There comes a time when silence becomes dishonesty.""To tell the truth, I didn't know what I was watching there near the end, I knew a good movie. It wasn't until the giant letters, 'Directed by Ang Lee' cut into the film, that I did know. When the large, words, Directed by Ang Lee, formed, I knew I just watched the best anti-gay movie ever made.This is how I wanted to end the 'review'. It's a good ending, I think. And that's exactly what 'Brokeback' is, very skillful anti-gay propaganda. Or perhaps the promotion of 'traditional values'. Brokeback, could have easily been just another film using reverse psychology. A silly, misogynistic film, an obvious parody of scenes we've all seen before. Having Jack and Ennis overcoming prejudice and the evil townsfolk in the film, or, showing Jack and Ennis as constantly the victims of society, but, if the film was a parody, I don't think the audience would have enjoyed it near as much. If anything the film, very nearly, does the opposite. In ultimately giving dignity to Jack and Ennis, Brokeback Mountain is a celebration of humanity. In giving dignity to Jack and Ennis, it opens the door to all of us being treated with dignify. Brokeback Mountain does it's best to celebrate the worth we each have in all of us. The worth that's shared by all of us. In celebrating our dignity, it's the best pro-gay/anti-gay movie I've ever seen. Or should I say - the best ""anti-gay, pro gays"", movie, ever.Well, 'The Band Played On' was pretty good too.",Brokeback Mountain

I did not know exactly what to expect going into this movie, except for the cliché stereotype of Brokeback Mountain. After watching it I was deeply moved by the epitome of what this movie really is: a true love story, regardless of gender.The direction of Ang Lee is simply spectacular. There is the scope of the mountain scenes, the gentle conversation between the main characters, and that all builds throughout the twenty years in which this movie takes place. It truly tells a story that some can relate to, while others can certainly see the message it portrays.If you go into this movie with an open mind, you will walk out of it with a greater understanding of what can happen with love in any stretch of the imagination. I highly recommend it, for the directing, acting, the musical score, and the message. 10 out of 10.",Brokeback Mountain
375,jackharding89-1,"Bold, beautiful and utterly brilliant...",10,17 April 2012,"Bold, beautiful and utterly brilliant. Ang Lee's heartbreaking cowboy film is a vital meditation on love and longing, maleness and morality. A year on from the passing of its leading light, The Edge remembers one of the decade's most important filmsAn eloquently tender slice of American cinema, Brokeback Mountain is a film I've held close to my heart now for quite some time. Among other things, this delicately spun picture brought to my attention the skills of an enticing young actor who was fast becoming recognised as one of the finest his generation had to offer. Heath Ledger. A dynamic talent whose Oscar Nominated turn in Ang Lee's epic love parable proved he was, in fact, the real deal. Okay, he didn't win the award and Brokeback was erroneously pipped to the best picture prize by the pretentious Crash. But in 10, 15, 20 years time, Lee's spacious adap of Annie Prolux's short story will no doubt be remembered as the film of 2006. Perhaps even the noughties. And while Ledger's show-stopping spin on Lee Bermejo's retooled Joker maybe the role forever coupled with his name, I will always remember him as the man who played a prominent part in the conception of, quite possibly, the greatest love story of our time.Set against the sweeping mountain vistas of Wymoing, Brokeback Mountain tells the tearful tale of Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal). Two twenty something ranch-hands who inadvertently forge a secret love affair in the summer of 1963 that, for all its twists and turns, snags, wrongs and rights, endures: emerging a subversive yet authentic testament to the power of love.Spanning three arduous decades, Ennis and Jack's covert allegory is one awash with danger, deceit, thought, feeling, density and doubt that bobs and weaves from start to finish. In spite of their mutual affection, Ennis's repressed spirit and alpha-male tendencies obscure the two men's hopes of a happy life together. Jack is the beta and more in-touch half of the bond who, in time, comes to terms with who and what he is. But for Ennis, things aren't so easy. He's a cagey, conflicted and near- inaudible entity who's always quick to remind Jack that their country and culture has a ""heterosexual or highway"" policy that cannot be inverted. Considered ""alien"" even now, homosexuality is outlawed in and around certain pockets of the U.S which is why controversy surrounded and continues to prod the picture three years on from its release. Given the underground credentials of art house autuers' Pedro Almodovar and Wong Kar Wai.Ang, Lee wasn't the first to tackle the theme head-on, but under the stuborn eye of the Hollywood mainstream's- he was. ""The first time I read the script for Brokeback, I rejected it,"" he confessed. ""The second time I read it I decided to do it for the exact same reason I'd rejected it before: no one was going to see it."" Lee was right to some extent: the percentage of insular homophobes occupying the mainstream of the movie going world was and is, no doubt, large. But Brokeback is too good a film to take on board the criticism dished out by the obtuse. Wake up, smell the coffee. This film is a flat out triumph. A gracefully spun tear jerker with hope, pride and splendour to spare. Brokeback Mountain is one of the most important films to come out of America in living memory. One that compels, captivates, moves and inspires: it stuck with me for months after viewing it.Much more than just a gay love yarn about two cowboys, Brokeback Mountain is a spectacle. A heart-wrenching morality play that has the power to reshape the notions and ideals of those who discard diversity. This is a film about love. Love that transcends gender, reason and the so-called ""norms"" laid down by a heterosexual world. Brokeback doesn't ask you to embrace homosexuality, but to understand it, to accept it. Discard it as an ""issue"", even, for love is an inescapable force that knows no bounds. Ennis and Jack's same-sex relationship even defies relevance as the film flows towards a melancholic finale, paving the way for a full fledged romantic melodrama that has an unmistakable air of Romeo and Juliet about it. Gylenhall is fantastic, Ledger is a revelation. The late chameleon's pitch-perfect portrayal of a troubled father and husband torn between what he feels and what he thinks he should feel is as true, as touching and as potent as anything you're likely to see in cinema. Much like the film's breathtaking backdrop and photography. Brokeback looks magnificent. The jagged peaks, land; lake and sky-scapes together with the deftly plucked and strummed strings of Gustavoa Santliano's acoustic guitar mount towards one effortlessly potent motif: reminding the viewer time and time again of the men's rocky liaison; of the struggle, pain and care they both share. Brokeback Mountain is an emotive masterpiece. A truly special film that has the dexterity to stir, touch and even transform.",Brokeback Mountain
376,Jamester,"Powerful, Numbing",10,12 September 2005,"I just saw this at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) to a packed house (with Ang Lee present for today's screening). And I have to say, it absolutely transfixed me and was worth the watch. Out of 24 movies I screened at the TIFF this year, this was the only one I rated a 10/10! Three things really stood out for me making this a stand-out of a film:1) HONESTY: Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal really pulled this off. I wasn't expecting performances so real and nuanced, and was warmly surprised. Kudos, also, to Mr. Lee for making such a poignant and refreshingly honest film!2) STORY: Great story-telling. In fact you're not actually being *told* a story. The story unfolds and the viewer watches what happens pulling you in. What a great experience! In fact, I want to experience this story again -- I'm going to look for the short story.3) NUMBING: In a thought-provoking kind of way. I left the theatre digesting the story even as I sat on the streetcar thinking about the characters. I cared for them, and wondered what could/might happen to them after the screen went black. My mind was playing out scenarios and in that sense, it was numbing, in a thought-provoking, emotionally heavy way.This is powerful cinema and is definitely worth checking out. It's the best Ang Lee film I've seen to date (I've seen most, but not all of his feature films).",Brokeback Mountain

Well, I'm a straight person and I saw this movie today. And to tell the truth it wasn't that bad.The love story between these two cowboys was somehow tragic since one of them meets their demise. This is a good movie to watch. Even if many gays and lesbians praise this movie, some straight men and women enjoyed it also because of how touching it was.The music was typically country style since it took place in places such as Texas and Wyoming and even in the mountains somewhere in the south.The movie was very good and deserved to win awards.

I thought it was one of those average movies, I didn't pay much attention to it. And today I decided to watch it because I had it on my list, and oh man!! What an amazing, heartwarming, heartbreaking and memorizing movie. The chemistry between Jack and Ennis is fantastically beautiful. You believe they're actual soul mates. This movie made me feel very happy but also especially very sad. It really depicts to you how life was to for a gay person during those times and especially in the south, it is heartbreaking. The movie is beautifully directed too. I'm not much of a reviewer, I just wanted to type this cause I really liked the movie, and I don't generally review movies or TV shows unless I really love them or really hate them.

381,parrot007,A passionate and influencial milestone for film.,9,2 September 2020,"For a film that spans so many different phases of our two main characters lives, Brokeback Mountain is incredibly well paced. Every single scene in this movie is given just enough time to develop the characters in meaningful ways without ever dragging on too long. This is executed with strong and powerful writing and outstanding performances, especially by Heath and Jake. Few other times have I seen such complicated emotional feelings covenyed this well in a film, those of confusion, sexual frustration, fading love, longing, and just pretending to be someone you aren't. Characters convey their feelings though their actions, not words, and Brokeback Mountain is a shining example of how this works so well when it's done right. Jack for example, wants to build a life with Ennis, but he slowly realizes that it can't work, and he tries to fulfill this longing via other people/means. It only makes his pain worse when he compares it to the few times he gets see him. And thus, despite having a life much better than Ennis', he suffers inside greatly. It's a powerful message to just commit to who you are and be honest with yourself.",Brokeback Mountain
382,Kevin_Maness,"good, but with a strange, pop-psych flaw",9,21 January 2006,"I enjoyed Brokeback Mountain, and especially the performance of Heath Ledger. I don't know how many movies I've seen where the dialogue has to state, explicitly, something like: ""if you keep bottling up your emotions like that, you're going to explode,"" but I've never seen someone act this concept as effectively as Ledger. At one point, when his emotions do blow up, it's hard to tell whether his appendix has ruptured or if he's merely trying not to cry. Overall, I agree with the positive comments about this movie's brilliant exploration of forbidden love and its patiently unfolding narrative.The only thing that bothered me about the movie was what appeared to me a strange pop-psych assumption that two under-educated cowboys, faced with inarticulable emotions and an untenable situation would resort to violence to express themselves. The whole, ""I'm loving you, so I'm punching you"" thing seemed a little trite and unexamined. I mean, is this really the way that a macho gay man would express his love physically? Would he really be torn between whether to kiss his lover or break his nose? Maybe so, in which case I'm happy to withdraw my criticism. But I felt like this bordered on insulting, almost like saying that men are such brutal, emotional cripples that this is probably the only way for them to communicate complex feeling and inner confusion. I guess this would be a screenplay issue, or is this part of the Annie Proulx story? In any event, this is a fairly minor flaw, I think, in an otherwise solid film.",Brokeback Mountain
383,wolverinesforever,Sadly misunderstood,9,1 September 2008,"It is ashaming that so many people have refused to see the impeccably made ""Brokeback Mountain"" because of its gay themes. It is heartbreaking that the Academy, after awarding Ang Lee a long overdue Oscar for Best Director, suddenly did a 180 and awarded Best Picture to the ""safe pick"" ""Crash"" instead. It is unfortunate that this film will never get the fullest appreciation it deserves because of its ""controversial"" material. The fact that so many people have rejected ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a sad sign that our culture still holds some very unfortunate prejudices or reservations that this film explicitly tackles (and very well too).This film, along with ""Walk the Line"" and ""Capote,"" is one of the best character studies of 2005. Hands down. The acting is simply excellent; Michelle Williams is incredibly compelling as the troubled wife whom tries to keep everything okay in a tight marriage but can't escape the fact that things were getting shaky from day one. Heath Ledger, as her husband, gives his best performance of his career in this feature. Yes, say all you want about him as the Joker in ""The Dark Knight,"" but I do believe history in time will judge this performance as his best and most well rounded. You can't help but feel saddened for him, as he struggles through relationships, through tough finances, through family, and through his identity. And of course, there's Jake Gyllenhall, whom also gives a stellar performance. Though you're glad that his character is better able to handle the same situations that Heath Ledger deals with, you can't help but worry for his slightly careless nature about his marriage and his feelings towards Ledger. Anne Hathaway too is a surprising find as a cowgirl who starts out spunky and wild but ends up hardened and edgy because of her so-so marriage to Gyllenhall.The writing is top notch. So what if the characters mumble through their lines and express emotions in subtle ways? That's life! We don't just openly declare our real feelings, we hide them, or speak about them in extremely reserved ways. I just love how deep the director Ang Lee gets into his characters. He dissects all of their complexities so well; they feel like regular human beings by the end of the film, as they should.Yes, it is slowly paced and does feel lengthy. But sometimes, through the toughest moments in life, we feel as though we can never escape them. This film wonderfully illustrates how it feels to have the ""wrong feelings"" in the ""wrong places"" at the ""wrong times."" And yet at the end of it all, you can still have the chance to make some things right again. But sadly, it is just that deep illustration that have repelled so many people away. I can only hope that time will give ""Brokeback Mountain"" the fullest justice it deserves.A heartbreaking masterpiece. My fullest recommendation.",Brokeback Mountain
384,AEBarschall,people who make themselves miserable,8,8 January 2006,"Acting: great photography: great sex scenes: great believability of story: pretty good overall: very sadHowever, why was this movie so sad? Was it so sad because these men couldn't cohabit publicly in a committed relationship? I don't think so. If they had been able to have the ranch that Jack dreamed of, it wouldn't have been all cuddling and swimming naked in mountain streams. They would have had to work hard and would have started bickering over personal habits, chores, and bills, just like the all the rest of us do with significantly others; and eventually they probably would have broken up, just like all the rest of us do. What was sad was that they couldn't feel happy and grateful over having the cool relationship that they did have. I walked out going, ""Gee, I don't think I've ever had any relationship that was as passionate, intense, and meaningful-seeming as theirs."" That's probably because I live in the real world, not in a movie. And real guys get passionate for a while, but then they get bored and distracted by something else. You only get passion like that in forbidden affairs.All of these people, whether gay or straight, who are drowning in self-pity because somehow their relationship doesn't measure up to what they see in the movies, need to realize that movie relationships are no more real than Harry Potter is. Gay people need to realize that an awful lot of, if not most, straight people feel disappointed in their relationships and fantasize about better people or more intriguing sex acts. And those straight people also go out and have affairs and consort with prostitutes as well. This is not reserved for gay people. Also, most real gay couples don't look like these two actors, either. When I was done watching the movie, I stood up and looked around and saw a real life gay couple. They were both pudgy and bald, with matching shirts.So, instead of feeling grateful that he and Ennis have these great, passionate vacations together, Jack Twist tortures himself the rest of the year, because he imagines that it would be possible for him to be on vacation like that all the time. A lot of people do that. Make gratitude lists. Count your blessings. Avoid wallowing in self-pity. Live clean. Eat healthily. Get plenty of sleep and exercise. Work hard. Pray and/or meditate a lot. Then you will be happy. Having the relationship you are dreaming of is not a long term solution for finding happiness.",Brokeback Mountain
385,Lockout_Salties,"Good, but very disappointing",7,9 December 2020,"Today is the 15th anniversary of Brokeback Mountain, and in honor of it I'm writing this review.I wanted to love this movie, but I just couldn't. I personally think it's, at best, a 7/10. I liked Gyllenhaal's performance a lot, as well as the two leading ladies'. But I honestly wasn't the biggest fan of Ledger's performance, and it was hard to understand him a lot of the time.Additionally, their relationship from friends to lovers had almost no sense of progression, which wouldn't be a problem if there was some sense of sexual tension between them pre-lovers. But there isn't, and so we get them acting like friends, and then spontaneously jumping into bed with each other.Another thing: while I liked Michelle William's performance, her character seemed very underdeveloped. We never see how she was brought up to treat LGBT people, and so I really didn't understand her motivations for a lot of the film. Did she think Ledger was a horrible sinner? Or was she simply never told about homosexuality in the first place? It's never shown, and so I had a hard time understanding her mindset.I was also very unsure of who we're supposed to root for. Are we supposed to feel sympathy for Michelle Williams? Well we have all the scenes with Gyllenhaal and Ledger that are obviously supposed to be heartwarming, so that can't be the case. Are we supposed to be rooting for the two men, then? Well no, because we have all these scenes of Michelle Williams being sad that her husband is cheating on her. And also, Michelle Williams' character is a really nice lady, and we have no reason to root against her other than she's in the way of Gyllenhaal and Ledger, which is in no way exclusive to her. So are we supposed to feel sympathy for both? If that's the case, the movie is too tonally confusing. Gyllenhaal and Ledger reuniting is played as a triumphant moment, but seconds later we cut to Williams being sad. So if we're supposed to feel happy for Ledger then sad for Michelle, what emotion are we supposed to take away from any of this? I don't have a problem with a movie that evokes a lot of emotions. One of my favourite movies ever, Florence Foster Jenkins, leaves me laughing on the ground one second, and crying my eyes out the next. But Brokeback Mountain, if it is trying to make us feel for both Williams and our cowboy couple, comes across as emotionally confused instead of complex, mainly due to the jarring juxtaposition of emotional scenes between the two parties.Finally, I'm really confused why everyone was weirdly okay with Ledger and Gyllenhaal's relationship. The cowboy who gave them their job together finds out they're together, but doesn't tell anybody and only cares because it led them to do a terrible job of sheep-caring. Wouldn't it make more sense for them to do a good job, and he fired them purely because of their sexuality? Because in the movie, his reasoning is perfectly legitimate: they did a very bad job taking care of the sheep, and so he does not want them to do it again. Michelle Williams doesn't tell anyone about her husband's adultery, not even asking advice from a gal pal of a priest or something. The only time we actually see any homophobia is in Ledger's childhood, and arguably when he finds out Gyllenhaal's died (although the latter is ambiguous as to whether or not he actually was the victim of a hate crime). The strange lack of almost all homophobia almost makes the time frame completely unnecessary. You could set it in the 90s-2010s and almost nothing would change. Why couldn't the movie further explore the prejudice and hate that LGBT+ people endured?Brokeback Mountain one of the first mainstream films about LGBT+ people, and it deserves a lot of credit for that, but I really think it is still very flawed. It gives me the impression of a fantastic 3 hour movie that was cut to pieces by the studio, and the movie suffered because of it. If that is the case, then I hope one day a director's cut will finally be released. Until then, I unfortunately do not think as highly of Brokeback Mountain as everyone else.Final Score: 65/100.",Brokeback Mountain
386,felixoscar,Glorious!,10,25 December 2005,"Thanks to all those involved in the creation of this film! It was a difficult project to get off the ground, yet, after too many years of delays, Brokeback Mountain has emerged with a happy ending ... for its viewers get to see a masterpiece! This love story, with its rich psychological, political, sociological overtones, is still essentially about the power of human connections. Under Ang Lee's care, and the remarkable work of the two screenwriter(I had read the short story), a modern love story, among two unlikely protagonists, amidst the grandeur, and misery of rural America, unfolds. Hopefully, those many who took a chance to bring this film to life will earn many rewards. SPOILER --- Several hours after watching this instant classic, I remain angry, disappointed at disturbed by Ennis' inability to alter his life. Things were hardly fulfilling for him by the mid 1970s: divorced, alone, ""always broke"", bored. He had a TV, he was aware that the world was changing, and he certainly yearned for time with Jack. Moving away from a failed life, just getting in a car and moving to California or Texas, Oregon, anywhere just to be with Jack, why the hell not? Being a waiter, a factory worker, anything!, as long as he had the one passion in his life with him, how could you resist? Clearly the demons that haunted him kept him from prevailing.But enough armchair psychology, and let's get a couple million viewers, especially young men, into the movie theater to really be exposed to something different, striking, important and memorable.",Brokeback Mountain
387,Nezz,Best Kiss of the Year,9,14 January 2006,"So I've finally found my film of the year to cheer for and (surprise surprise) it's Brokeback Mountain.Despite all the deafing buzz surround the film, I actually managed to go into the film relatively unfazed and was shocked at how good this film is without all the Oscarbuzz clouding up my perspective. If for any reason Ang Lee hadn't secured his-self in my top 3 favorite directors by now, he's safe now.I have to say I've never been a fan of Heath Ledger. I have just never found him interesting as an actor and the only movie of his I can really tolerate is A Knight's Tale. But I have to say his portrayal of Ennis Del Mar is one of the best performances I've seen an actor give since the 00's began. From his inarticulate way of speaking to the hurt seen in his eyes, Ledger captivates throughout the entire film. He never once lets up and I appreciate that so much.Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist is just a wonderful ball of boyish sexuality and confusion. Obviously Twist is more comfortable with his sexuality than Ennis at first and Gyllenhaal is completely believable as a man starving for love and waiting at all cost.The women are good as well. I actually prefer Hathaway to Williams simply because I'm so shocked she had that type of character performance in her. She is so hilarious as a rich Texas girl growing into the type of rich bitch that type of person could become. Williams was good as Alma but it's nothing I haven't seen from Williams before. She gave knockout performance after another on Dawson's Creek all the time.There are so many scenes in this film that are absolutely heartbreaking but the absolute best one is the Reunion Kiss between Ennis and Jack in front of the house. Best Kiss of the Year.Best Film of the Year.A+",Brokeback Mountain
388,JCBar,Disappointing,4,16 February 2006,"Brokeback Mountain is one of the most disappointing films I've seen this year. By now all know about the 'gay cowboy' film. And that aspect of the story did not bother me at all. I don't care who falls in love with whom. The sex scenes did not faze me, nor did I even find them all that graphic or jarring.The main problem I had, besides it being somewhat dull, was this - I was unconvinced that the two leads even liked each - I could discern no chemistry between them. Plus, I couldn't connect with them either - as characters, as victims, or even as star crossed lovers. The only character I cared about (always a bad sign when you start looking for people to care about in a film) was Michelle Williams, who plays the wife of Heath Ledger's character, and stands out the most here for her overall excellent performance.As far as the rest of the performances go, there is not a bad one. But I was surprised at the accents - Heath Ledger's accent sounds like every Aussie or Brit actor who 'can't' do an American accent - or hams up a Southern one so clichéd that a Foghorn Leghorn image springs up. And I'm not sure a Wyoming cowboy would sound that way anyway. As far as Jake Gyllenhaal's Texas accent, I found it nondescript  being not all sure he was even attempting one.Spoiler coming - and while the off-screen (for the most part) murder takes place in Texas, and not in Wyoming, the allusion to the Matthew Shephard killing is one that I waited for the entire movie  esp with the foreshadowing of the two cowboys being 'shepherds' in the beginning of the film, the story of the two other cowboys (who were beat to death) that Ennis tells Jack about, and the fact that the movie takes place in Wyoming. But that is not a major complaint  that was mostly my fault. Most will find that the movie is really not a preachy movie  it is primarily just a love story between these two men. I just wish it hadn't been as dull as it was.",Brokeback Mountain
389,morphion2,Certainly Doesn't Disappoint,9,28 January 2006,"Director Ang Lee made his big Hollywood splash with the 2000 blockbuster ""Wo Hug Cang Long (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon)"". This first film was a dazzling display of artistic flair, a talent lost on his later blockbuster ""Hulk"", starring Australian comedian Eric Bana. His 2005 project, an adaptation of the Annie Proulx short story ""Brokeback Mountain"", is in a very different style to his two previous films, and by a mile the most critically acclaimed.Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) are two lonely cowboys who meet while applying for work in the summer of 1963. Sent out on a sheepherding run up to fictitious Brokeback Mountain, Wyoming for several months, the two men begin to form a bond with one another, which grows into affection which becomes a passionate affair. At the end of the summer, they each go home, Jack to his sick father and Ennis to his fiancé. However, their fierce and undying love for one another stays strong through the following years, and they each must face great hardships and tragedy in their struggle between social responsibility and happiness.""Brokeback Mountain"" is the most talked-about film of the year, for many reasons; the subject matter, the direction, the cinematography, the acting. But it's not a film for everyone. At over two hours, it plods along with what will be for some an insufferably slow pace. This will be one of the main criticisms from viewers not overly interested or engaged by the story to begin with. But its celebrated success is by no means undeserved.The most striking thing about the film is its infinite subtlety. Almost everything of importance is said without words. The opening scene of Jack and Ennis meeting each other for the first time is a beautiful example of this; and the two lead actors look so cute shying away from each other under the brims of their cowboy hats. Another thing that works with the subtlety of the film is the frustrated inarticulacy of Ledger's character; he has to communicate without words because he simply doesn't have the words he wants to say. It is, just quietly, a sensational performance from the Australian actor, a display of talent previously hidden in his other works.Opposite Ledger, of course, is the equally good Jake Gyllenhaal, as the more honest and communicative of the duo. Jack Twist is not as deeply ashamed and mortified of his affections as his surly lover, but he nonetheless does everything society expects of him, including getting married and having children. Gyllenhaal shows a different side of himself than ever seen before in this suitably restrained performance, which simmers under the surface with a deep passion. If this is any indication of the direction Gyllenhaal's acting style is going, upcoming war-movie ""Jarhead"" promises to be even more rewarding than already imagined.Performances from the supporting cast of women in the film are all quite stunning, especially the two cowboys' respective wives, Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams (Ledger's real life partner). They don't get as much screen-time as the men, but they shine fabulously, even when somber or in pain. Their pain is, in fact, a central point of the film's message; far more people get hurt than are to blame.Finally comes the picture's most memorable quality: some films are sad, some films are depressing, but ""Brokeback Mountain"" is one of the few truly heartbreaking films of the western world. For those unconvinced or uninterested by the subtle ingredients the movie has to offer, perhaps emotional turmoil will be out of the question, but for most the story and, more particularly, the acting will move you to tears.There is no perfect film, to be sure; each has their flaws, and ""Brokeback Mountain"" is no different. A little editing would not have gone amiss, but aside from that, this is pretty brilliant stuff, well worthy of its high critical praise and, for my money, not likely to be rivaled for outstanding performances by any other film this year.",Brokeback Mountain
390,Juliette2005,Beautiful,9,11 February 2006,"This is a powerful beautiful film about love, in whatever form it takes. The acting is all superlative, but the film making itself is what sets this apart.Here is a film maker who is not afraid to take time, to show you images with music, it's not fast paced (that's not to say it's slow) and it loves itself in a good way, if that makes any sense at all.Ang Lee is truly a gifted film maker, he crafts this film from a simple story into a deeply thoughtful and moving testament to love, and a political comment on our world as well.Yes, it features some of the worst wigs seen on film since Everybodys All American, but no matter. It's a beautiful piece of work, and one of the few films that you should actually see on a big screen- it's vast.",Brokeback Mountain
391,trevd-22977,A Beautiful Thing That Bites Hard & Devastates!,9,14 October 2018,"I went to see Brokeback Mountain at the cinema with a friend when it was first released as there was so much fuss made about it. I was completely unprepared for the emotional king hit this film has. 
 I have subsequently purchased the film on DVD but have never been able to watch it again. A bit like keeping a dangerous thing tied up where you know it's safe. It is beautiful to look at and very intelligently made but the pain portrayed in those last few moments of the film are just too much to ever want to endure again. This is the most affecting and saddest scene I have ever experienced in a film.
 For the artistic team & the director to have made a movie like this that explores so artfully the themes of denial, repression, betrayal & loss. I give the film 9.5/10. Strange to think so highly of a film that I will probably never watch again.
 If you have any sort of empathy for your fellow man, approach this with caution but I absolutely recommend you watch it at least once.
 Brilliant, Brilliant Cinematic Artistry.",Brokeback Mountain

Afterwards, I thought about why. I'd seen male ""gay"" interaction on screen before, but not like this. These two were very much IN LOVE, and I was not prepared for it.This is NOT the ""Best Picture"" of the year, but very decent.Anne Hathaway has shown she's all grown up and not uncomfortable with nudity here (and in Havoc).

393,Kelt Smith,Far More Powerful Than I'd Anticipated,10,1 January 2006,"The now familiar story of 2 cowboys in 1963 Wyoming who unexpectedly fall in love is one powerful movie ! Aside from the gorgeous scenery, the first 45 minutes are rather slow viewing. Jack Twist (GYLLENHAAL) and Ennis Del Mar (LEDGER) are hired for a summer to watch a herd of sheep as they graze in the mountains of Wyoming. Both young men are from poor backgrounds. Del Mar is particularly quiet and says little. Alone out on BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN, they slowly begin to bond. One night as they share a tent sleeping, a casual arm pulling the other nearer leads to a suppressed release of passion. That done, the story really begins to take off. They part ways at summer's end. Ennis vomits and pounds a wall, partially because he's confused about his taboo love, partially because he's not an articulate individual. Each marries a woman that they seem to love, but not be in love with. The men reunite 4 years later when Jack is going through the town where Ennis is living with his wife (WILLIAMS) and two young daughters. Ennis looks like he is alive for the first time in years when his old friend arrives. Ennis's wife sees the two men kissing during the initial visit, but says nothing. She is numb. The men go away on a 'fishing trip' which is a romantic liaison. They decide to go on fishing trips whenever times allow: Once, twice a year. Jack's wife (HATHAWAY) appears not to be aware of anything out of the ordinary except for her father's apparent contempt for her husband. Their story continues over the course of 20 years. Their inability to communicate and how they in turn express themselves is the real tale.Precisely directed with standout performances by LEDGER, GYLLENHALL, HATHAWAY & WILLIAMS, this is definitely one intense, powerful piece of storytelling. Very well done, and one of the best movies with a real 'story' that I've seen in years.",Brokeback Mountain
394,NateF88,Defines Reality,10,26 December 2005,"Brokeback Mountain: The most realistic and heartwarming film of the year. I must say, December of 2005 is turning out to be one hell of a month for film fans. First, there was the brilliant King Kong, then there was Munich, and now there's Brokeback Mountain.Though everyone pretty much knows that this film is about gay cowboys, it's about much more than that. It's more about how Enis and Jack live their lives together in hiding, and how society's disapproval of homosexuality affects not only Ennis and Jack, but the one's who do not accept it. However, those themes are very subtle, and the message isn't slapped right in your face. You really have to observe the chain of events that occur in the film. For ever action in the film, there is a reaction. Another interesting thing about Brokeback Mountain is that you can easily identify the structure of the story. By that I mean the key sequences in the film. Without giving anything away, I'll start by saying the complication of the film is Ennis's and Jack's relationship on Brokeback having to be kept secret. There is also an easily identifiable turning point and climax. The acting by both actors of Jack and Ennis are top notch, as are the performances of the contributing characters. The setting is definitely an important part of the picture, and helps express the sedate, yet tense mood of the picture. The story, like I said before, is perfectly structured, and filled with funny and heartbreaking moments. Everything is wrapped up very nicely in a perfect denouement.Ennis and Jack are the cutest on screen couple I have seen in a while. It's rare a couple on screen has so much passion for each other. The film is very realistic. It defines reality due to it's dead-on portrayal of homophobia in America. I believe, while being very subtle, there is a strong message in this film that will make people think.",Brokeback Mountain
395,jeev7882,Too much bad to go along with the good,6,11 May 2006,"Grade: B-Brokeback Mountain is a brave and daring movie that wisely doesn't focus on its controversial nature. This is a story about an unconventional love. The movie is quiet and simple, like its main character Ennis Del Mar. The biggest problems are that the performances and characters are the strongest points of the movie, not the screenplay and plot. Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams both give great performances well worth of the praise they are receiving. Jake Gyllenhall is very underrated. His character, Jack, is more outgoing, not as subtle or complicated as Ennis. The first act of the movie, until Ennis and Jack get together, is very slow. There are numerous shots and scenes with no purpose that really detract from what the movie could have been. All in all, Brokeback Mountain is good, but it's certainly not the best movie of the year.",Brokeback Mountain
396,Britinmiami,Brilliant! And about time...,10,18 December 2005,"I came out of this film stunned! At last a film that portrayed the real angst of a love affair that, for all we know, could have been replicated a million times not only in America, but all over the world.The tension between the characters was so thrilling and the acting was superb! It was easy to get into the lives of both of these guys and feel the pain of the situation they were in. What were they to do? Every character in this film had a pivotal role. At one moment you felt for Ennis's wife as she had to play a character in his life because he didn't know what to... She really loved him but he could not love her back. His love was elsewhere and it was constantly eating him up. But what could he do! The pain throughout was so intense at times you wanted to cry.I believe that Lee did a brilliant job with this film and it will be seen as a classic in time. I hope the actors get the recognition they deserve. Finally, I hope enough people see this film that it will make a difference.If you are thinking about seeing a serious movie, go and see this one.P.S. The scenery is beautiful and deserves to be seen on a big screen - don't wait for the video!",Brokeback Mountain
397,ArmsAndMan,The McMurtry Touch,8,25 January 2006,"When I first read Annie Proulx's story in the New Yorker, I was moved by the ending and admired its political subtext, but felt the story entire didn't spring to life. It came across as a pulpy example of political correctness where the characters never escaped their author's noble intentions. Proulx's first love scene between Jack and Ennis was rushed and corny and somehow false -- their actions being the product of an impatient writer. Because of this mixed experience, I dreaded seeing the film.What a surprise. The filmmakers took Proulx's sketch and turned it into a love story to rival the best works of Larry McMurtry, right up there with ""Hud"" and ""Lonesome Dove"" and all the other stories that acknowledge ""love is a force of nature."" There are so many great moments with the McMurtry touch, but the biggest influence can be seen in the female characters, and how much impact they carry.The moment that makes or breaks the film -- the first love scene -- is a testament to Ang Lee's skill as a director. The care used to establish this moment, a flawless first act, is peerless.In a year with several outstanding films, 2005 will always be remembered for this outstanding collaboration: Ang Lee, Larry McMurtry, and Heath Ledger.",Brokeback Mountain
398,phaylen,"""Brokeback"" not all it's cracked up to be",4,24 January 2006,"I was one of those people anxiously awaiting this film that has been critically lauded since before it's release. I listened with great anticipation as people in various internet/news/magazine forums raved about how important and inspirational this film was. It won SAG awards, Golden Globes, Director's Guild Awards, and is the front runner for this years Best Picture Oscar. Finally, I saw ""Brokeback Mountain.""Now, it's time to be honest, to cut right into the bone and leave the meat for the industry hype machines. What was supposed to be one of the most profound love stories of our time was everything but. The pacing was so proposterously slow that I nearly fell asleep in the first hour. Sometimes, 15 minutes of screen time would pass with only three words of dialog. The atmosphere Ang lee set up is unmistakably his signature, sweeing mountains, mists in the forests, the feeling of remoteness. Intentional, I'm certain. While the performances in this film were stellar, it boils down to this; The story was benign. Truly the most vacant story I've seen in years. Far to quiet to maintain any true cinematic value, with the exception of the aforementioned cinematography. The powerful love story hailed worldwide is actually not at all absorbing, but makes you feel more sympathetic to the women in their lives that they are uniformly deceiving. The focus was not at all on the male protagonists, but how they adapted to mundane lives away from Brokeback Mountain...I expected to be moved beyond measure, in fact, I was bored, emotionally detached, even a little depressed by the ending, which was so anticlimactic that it failed to serve any real emotional impact except the traditional ""awww...""I believe now, after experiencing ""Brokeback Mountain"" that this IS an important film only in that it spotlights the very real repression many gays suffer with even today. If homosexuality were not the centerpiece of this film, it would never have been made specifically because of the dry, dull nature of it. ""Brokeback"" should be regarded as a statement film. Thats what it set out to do, and thats what it has accomplished, much in the same way ""Schindler's List"" (a far better film) portrayed the Jewish tragedies during the Holocaust. Because of these statements alone we celebrate like these.. In Brokeback's case-not because they are exempliry of cinematic greatness, but because they encourage a progressive mentality, and promote a little more social understanding.",Brokeback Mountain
399,smoothhoney1265,Much ado about two cowboys,3,30 March 2006,"So this is finally it. The movie that moved so many critics in the world. The movie basically everybody has been talking about in the past months. The movie I have been waiting for and looking forward to seeing for three years. Just to leave the cinema with an empty feeling afterwards.Two men who love each other are unable and scared to admit it because of the time and the society they live in. What potential stuff for a movie! Even more so because it is set in the Wild West area but presented in a natural way. Annie Proulx' short story ""Brokeback Mountain"" is probably the most powerful, moving, tender and beautiful tale and love story I've ever read in my life. Too bad Ang Lee turned it into a sleepy two-hour documentary of the undoubtfully stunning Canadian landscape and the forced acting of two young Hollywood actors. Because basically this is how you can sum up the film that  according to critics  should actually be able to shake our beliefs and change the world.As for me, it just didn't reach me. Or touch me. Or move me. Maybe Jake Gyllenhaal is just too flamboyant to play a simple cowboy. Or Heath Ledger too intellectual. From time to time their faces basically scream in this movie: ""Give us Shakespeare! Or Allen!"" Maybe the movie is badly cut (which surprised me the most as it is made by Ang Lee)  the scenes and landscapes just are lined up one after another and somehow there is no time or space for them to set in. There is no flow. But what annoyed me most is really the obviously forced acting of the two protagonists that ruined the film. The sentence ""I don't want to do it but let's just get over it"" is all over the place and casts its shadows at every intimate scene those two cowboys have together. Also, often the viewer simply has the feeling to be in a theater and either watch two people perform in a hysteric, overacting way or witness two actors rehearse for their roles. Distance between a performance and the audience might be a good thing and work in a theatre but it sure is bad in a movie because I think the most important thing a film should achieve is to pull you straight into the plot and capture you so for one moment you forget about reality.It's not about the gay aspect of the story. But this couple in love just isn't authentic enough. Or close enough. Or goddamnit human enough. Two men who work together surprisingly notice that they are attracted to each other. One day, their feelings just overwhelm them and they have sex in the first place they can find  tearing down each others' clothes, sweating, not knowing what to do and one of them simply thrusting into the other. It's all violence and energy, with one or two tender looks in their eyes but so much lust and passion. It's dirty, it's uncontrolled, it's all over the place. You can see their pain and lust in their faces, you can almost feel it. One of the best (first) love scenes I have ever seen in cinema. But what I have just described here is a scene from the gay drama ""Proteus"" and something you definitely won't find in ""Brokeback Mountain"". Yet there were one or two strong things in this film. Stunning, powerful and moving performances by the two leading ladies  Michelle Williams' and Anne Hathaway's best work so far. The soundtrack has the most beautiful music I've ever heard in a movie and is the only thing about ""Brokeback Mountain"" that really deserves the buzz. And then of course the shots of the stunning Canadian landscape I've already mentioned  they breathe wilderness, freedom and freshness so you just wanna pack your bag and travel there. But what's the use in two good actresses, great music and stunning landscape if you can simply forget about the rest of the film?My final conclusion is that this film was shot in the wrong time (it should have been thirty or forty years earlier), the wrong director (should have been a gay one or Francis Ford Coppola), the wrong (male, leading) cast (too young, too Hollywood) and simply in too big dimensions. I really wish that this story will be adapted again one day  by an independent, small, largely unknown European company, an independent, largely unknown director, with an independent, largely unknown cast. I think that would hit the tone of the novel far better than this large blockbuster something.There have been and hopefully will be films that can shake your beliefs, change the world and some ignorant minds. Brokeback Mountain is not one of them.",Brokeback Mountain

As a liberal, I was not offended in any way by the movie. However, I found the movie to be very slow moving and too long, as well as short on entertainment value. I had recently seen Match Point and The Squid and the Whale and found them to be extremely well acted and much more enjoyable.The acting was uniformly good, but I expect that in a high caliber movie. The real plus of the movie is the Director was able to convey extremely well the emotional turmoil that the characters felt. However, there is a lot to endure to reach that end.I hope I don't sit back and see this movie take a lot of awards because it was so hyped by the critics. I haven't seen Munich yet, but of the movies I have seen this year, there are a number that I liked much better, including the aforementioned, and Crash, I Walk the Line, and Hustle and Flow.If you have to see all the movies that will be nominated for best picture, you'll probably have to see this one.

403,featheredsun,A Moving Film About Love and Regret,8,29 March 2011,"This movie is beautiful. It paints a nuanced and heady landscape of fear, love, social unease, anger, and most of all - the pain of knowing that you could have had something wonderful and you didn't step up and own it.You can see some parallels b/w the story of Jack and Ennis and Li Mu Bai and Yu Shu Lien in another of Ang Lee's understated love stories, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. In both films we see two people who are drawn together by a deep soul-felt bond of love, but hesitant to embrace it fully because of the societal constraints they follow.You can approve or disapprove with the characters' choices in life, and this film shows you plenty of reasons for either. Both men are married and have families and we see the pain, especially in Ennis' case of how infidelity hurts all around it including the men responsible. But though you may judge, you still feel the strength of the bond between these two men...feel the sense of pure freedom the mountain gives them. It transcends many things.The acting, all round, is superb. The cinematography is open, bare, and grand. The story paced perfectly.A great, sad, moving film that will move anyone...ANYONE...who has felt soulful longing and love that for whatever reason was never given a real shot.

I am about to watch it again after i write this review. Like many others, I felt obliged to commend Ang Lee, the late Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal and everyone else involved in this wonderful film. A true modern day classic.First and foremost, I decided to watch this movie because I heard about a steamy scene between the two leads Ledger and Gyllenhaal, which in itself was amazingly executed- but i had no idea what i was in for with the movie. Which was why I'm even more upset and hypnotized by this film. Don't do too much research, go in blind.Ledger and Gyllenhaal are exceptional and have the most amazing on screen chemistry (especially considering they were both heterosexual- to the best of my knowledge) The relationship Jack Twist, upbeat rodeo boy and Ennis Del Mar, glum ranch guy have is spellbinding. The looks they give each other, the subtle touches and their constant longing for each other makes this EVEN MORE heartbreaking! I won't spoil anything for you but be warned- you will feel deeply affected by this movie, i know i have been- In a beautiful way!Today, i have felt slightly empty. Feeling lost with out Brokeback Mountain and all it ensues. It is truly the best movie i have ever watched and i have seen many a film. I need to watch it again because i feel i need closure otherwise this film will haunt me forever. I have told all my friends about this film, and felt i needed to tell you too! I can't stop thinking about this film, and everything that went on. It covers 20 years of life, love and mountain trips that are truly delightful. Delightful.If you make the brilliant decision of watching this film, you are in for a roller-coaster of humour, heartbreak and passion like no other film.

408,newday98074,Relationships,6,18 April 2007,"Based on Brokeback and Crouching Tiger I believe Lee is better showing representational relationships than the real thing. Westerns, gangster movies, teenage love films, have used this method for years to bypass building stories. Viewers assume the lone cowboy and rancher girl will fall in love, the hard-bitten gangster moll has a heart of gold, etc. Lee wants us to assume facts about the marriages of the two cowboys but gives us little more than cliché. Neither marriage succeeded as a relationship I could believe in and that removed the reality of the cowboy's love for each other. Did these guys really love anyone? It might have been better to make their meetings strictly sexual trysts (as they were portrayed when in action) and skip the love angle because I couldn't figure out if they loved each other or loved the sex or loved being loners and used that to get out of facing the world, another unexplored angle. A pet peeve: reaction shots to show us what to think about what is going on. Such shots tell me the director believes that the characters and script need help, as in the closeup of the daughter's face toward the end of the film displaying adoration of her father. If she had shown a fraction of understanding of him, empathy, even sympathy, it might have worked, but why use that shot at all? Let us think what we think. Ah well, that's Hollywood.",Brokeback Mountain
409,SandeepLoyalka,Have I missed something?!,2,4 February 2006,"To all the people of the world who've loved this film - 'What movie did you guys see?!'This has to be one of the dullest,blandest and most irritatingly sterile film's that I've watched in my entire movie-going life.Based on a short story by Annie Proulx,it should have remained just that - a short story.But screenwriters McMurtry and Ossana in their infinite wisdom have seen it fit to 'flesh-out' the story in order that it become 'filmable'.Although the story spans 20 years,the main leads don't seem to look any older than their younger selves and,in particular,the horrendous and amateurish wigs worn by all the protagonists appear positively laughable (don't miss the stick-on sideburns!).Heath Ledger's 'fantastic' performance amounts to spending the whole movie speaking from the south-west corner of his mouth so that audiences go back not having understood a word of what he said.The pace of the film is,to put it politely,leisurely,and I found myself looking at my watch once too often to check on the seemingly endless passage of time.To top it all,although this is supposed to be a love story,it distinctly comes across more as a lust story.I'm practically speechless as to why this movie has got so many raves.It's probably going to sweep all the major awards and I guess I'll have to enroll in some film-appreciation classes to perhaps 'understand' and fully appreciate this kind of cinema.As was the case with director Lee's earlier monumental bore 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon','Brokeback Mountain' left me cold and completely unmoved.If this seems less like a review and more like a rant,then I guess it just points to the fact as to how passionately I detest this piece of trite.The 2/10 rating is only for Rodrigo Prieto's breathtaking cinematography.",Brokeback Mountain

411,ducdebrabant,they belonged together,10,12 December 2005,"I waited all my life to see a beautiful, sweeping big-screen love story between two men, with production values and real movie stars. Now I've seen one. I hope I don't have to wait too long to see a financially successful one -- that this one is it. I do now have to wait for one where the story is easy and happy and the world isn't against them.All of the acting in the movie is excellent. Heath Ledger, who seems to have the farthest to go to get to the character he plays, is probably going to get more of the kudos. Gyllenhaal is able to use more of his own personality, as we know it.Ang Lee's direction is superb. I do want to say something about the sex. Because there are no big long sweaty naked love scenes, I think a lot of people may be expecting something sanitized and overpolite. That is not the case, in my opinion. In the first place, there is a fair amount of nudity, that simply isn't shown in a sexual context, but is assimilated into the sex within the viewer's mind. In the second place, the passion these men feel for each other is in EVERYTHING. It's even manifested in scenes where one of them is not present. It runs through their lives like veins in their skin. I don't believe you'll feel shortchanged, and I think after seeing it you may agree that the film would have seemed more manipulative if it had included the standard, glamorized and ultra-titillating, talk-about scenes some people were hoping for.For example, in a Hollywood film in which Brad and Angelina strip down and do it for 20 seconds (a long time) in front of a fireplace or a lot of candles, you may be wishing you were with Brad, or wishing you were with Angelina. In ""Brokeback Mountain,"" even though I find both actors attractive, I never for a single moment wanted Jack or Ennis to be with anybody on earth but one another. That's the film's accomplishment.",Brokeback Mountain
412,AlanSKaufman,"Loneliness, the Bible, and Brokeback Mountain",10,24 December 2005,"It's Christmas Eve as I write this article. We're all aware that in our culture, this holiday is not about Christ but rather commercialism and family. For those of us living alone with limited means the season can be torturous. But since money does not buy happiness, and many relationships have difficulties, even rich couples can feel empty. Jesus Himself was neither wealthy nor a family man. He associated with persons who were social outcasts. He loved His male disciple. Then He died painfully, abandoned by most of His friends. His experience offers solace to some, but others seek something more tangible.Many people escape their loneliness through movies with a ""Hollywood"" ending. But consider It's A Wonderful Life. Were it not for his impossibly wonderful wife, would Jimmy Stewart's character have found the will to live? And are those of us without such a partner really made happy by this couple's happy ending? Frankly, as a single person, I'd more identify with a movie whose lead character handles loneliness, showing us how it can be done.Such a movie is Brokeback Mountain. But before I can say more, we must deal with the word on the street that Brokeback is about gay cowboys lusting after each other, ruining their respective marriages in the process. Rather than condemning this homophobic view, let us recognize that many men properly fear dating the same gender precisely because sex would get in the way of genuine friendship as is too often the case between men and women.As Apostle Paul flat out says, it is best to be single and celibate, but if one cannot control one's lust, then one should marry. While it can be debated whether the Bible explicitly condemns homosexuality (the interpretation depends on which translation one uses), marital sex is clearly not held in high esteem and is necessary only for procreation. Brokeback acknowledges this by displaying equally unpleasant sexual scenes with both same and opposite genders, but honors having children. Unlike so many ""romantic"" movies of today that pretend ""making love"" is heartfelt love, Brokeback plays it straight, pun intended.I won't disclose the ending but the movie hints at its denouement from the opening scene with the lead character Ennis waiting for someone. Because of all the hype surrounding the alleged gay theme, I initially wondered if he was hoping for a pickup. But of course not! He's actually anticipating an employment interview. I realized that I needed to put out of my head preconceptions and grasp what I was seeing. I then understood that this movie is the story of Ennis through his own eyes. His physical involvement with a man occupies only a small portion of the screen time. Mostly Ennis copes with what he has sown, struggling to achieve salvation.Brokeback Mountain rephrases the question ""is it better to have never loved than loved and lost?"" to ""is it better to have never loved than lost the chance to love?"". The paradox is that one can only answer either question by experiencing the consequences. Without a lover at hand, one can exist on fantasies of an entirely imaginary lover, or on fantasies of what love was or might have been like with a specific real person.Watch Brokeback Mountain not for what the hype says, but for what it says in context. Though the word ""says"" is misleading. The dialog in the film is sparse as most of the context is expressed through facial expressions and body language. This is acting at its finest.

413,ociopia,Extraordinary,10,3 January 2006,"This must be a breakthrough film. It certainly is for me. I was not expecting such depth and quality. Being 60 and from Oklahoma, the hardscrabble life of no hope and make do resonated too close. I remember those ""the mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation"" people. Ang Lee manages to get them to emote. At one point I thought, ""no wonder we have sex between men and women - otherwise there wouldn't be any communication at all."" And between men and men? Just the way they rarely look each other in the eye. Unbelievably wrenching. Heath Ledger is brilliant. There is no other word for it. Mute, muffled, and mumbling, he is the everyman of the everyday man, haunting in the separateness of being male. Jake G. manages to light a fire inside Heath's character, but every spark is eventually blown out by the bleakness, only to be rekindled with their reunions. This is love as survival. Don't miss it. You will be awakened.",Brokeback Mountain
414,jerk1483,Landmark Classic...but it could have been so much more,9,10 January 2006,"There are so many moments in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN where you wonder, doesn't anybody just cry it out once in a while? Having recently gone through a heart-wrenching long distance relationship, I know the anguish these men wore on their faces. It's no chore, probably even for utter homophobes, to get over the gay thing. The film deftly handles how they consummate their love, making it seem raw and tender and genuine, not flirty and flamboyant as gay men are so often portrayed in pop-culture. In fact, it doesn't really feel like a ""gay"" film, it's just a plain old love story which is gut-wrenchingly sad. That said, I couldn't help but wonder if this could have been one for the ages. They're calling it the gay Gone With the Wind, but it's more emotionally spare than that. Heath Ledger is a force on screen. In a moment at the beginning, he has the look of a lost 5 year old boy. He's laconic not to be cool or tough, but because deep inside he trembles at the entire world. It's a simple look, probably unplanned, but he shows just a little the inner turmoil that he cannot let loose. He's not just a closeted homosexual, he's closeted about everything.This film might run away with the Best Picture Oscar and years from now people will remember a defining moment (perhaps) in the gay rights movement. This could be, in a way, the gay ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?"" Perhaps not a flawless masterpiece, but a humanizing look into the taboos of our times. Just like all classic screen lovers, you yearn for them to make it out together and happy, but the prejudices of others always seem to end that, don't they. Overall, an excellent film, certainly nothing too salacious for even your most staunch Republican conservative male. Surprising as it may sound to say it, this film was just a bit too chaste, but I suppose that's more an issue with our times.",Brokeback Mountain

Annis (Heath Ledger) feared for Jack (Jake Gyllanhaal)that they will end up dead if they lived together as a couple. My God! That scene when Annis was 9, he was shown a dead man with his penis chopped off for being gay!! Shocking! And then, when Annis retrieved a letter from Jack that said he was deceased! According to Jack's wife, he died from a popped tyre but Annis believed that Jack was gay bashed!! And I could believe that, but it was easier to believe that he died from a popped tyre because, that was too shattering to believe in! But whatever happened to Jack, it just meant that Annis's and Jack's relationship was over! And after watching this film, it had such an effect on me and it made me cry for 4 days!

416,ken1848,Move Thee Reviews: LOVE the People Around You Before It's Too Late,10,28 April 2011,"Brokeback Mountain is a great film with mesmerizing music, stunning cinematography and superb acting. Director Ang Lee takes his time developing the characters and situations, making the proceedings credible. Don't expect to watch a very entertaining tear-jerker. There are no ups and downs and it is slowly-paced, but what happens to these two men who love each other may touch you.For the prejudiced folks disliking homosexuals, this movie may reaffirm their beliefs that homosexuality ruins families when people follow their sinful desires. However, they don't see that Ennis and Jack are not only lying to their wives, but also to themselves, and the principal culprit leading to the tragedies is the ""social norms"" pressurizing them to get married and have children. They are in fact victims whose lives become regrettable as a result.The magnificent Wyoming settings captured emphasizes natural beauty, as well as the feeling of remoteness and isolation. It seems that Ennis and Jack can only live happily there, without others. Both of them are in the wrong place at the wrong time.The moon also symbolizes their intimacy which cannot be made public.The story is a tragedy because Ennis and Jack have found something that some people, of whatever sexual orientation, never find - true love, AND they can't do anything about it. I finished watching this haunting film with a heavy heart and a profound sigh, pondering how the social norms cruelly ruin the lives of these two men who love each other. ""If you cannot fix it, you have to stand it."" Open your heart to see the film and it will break your heart, quietly, without special pleading and sentimentality, at the end.

419,FargoUT,Lonely Broken Hearts,10,4 December 2006,"""Brokeback Mountain"" was the first short story I read from Annie Proulx--it was also the last. Her story drove me into a week-long depression, a reaction I've never had before or since. Her words spoke volumes in just a few short pages. I read this story after hearing about Ang Lee taking the director's chair for this supposedly ""gay cowboy"" adaptation. This oversimplification may have simply lowered my emotional guard. Why not also call Shakespeare's ""Romeo & Juliet"" a love story about teens? Brokeback Mountain, as filmed by Ang Lee, is one of the best romantic tragedies I've ever seen. It is one of the greatest love stories ever told. It is also one of the saddest, most heart-wrenching displays of grief, fear and regret to ever grace the silver screen. It is a tragedy of epic proportions--this is not the simple story of two gay cowboys (which isn't even accurate itself since they are not cowboys). It is about families torn apart through lies, it is about society's inability to accept unconventional love, it is about a man who is so stricken with fear that he is unable to accept love from anyone. Ennis Del Mar is a representation of the lonely broken heart, damaged at an early age and incapable or unwilling to be mended.Both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal play these characters with respect and dignity, relying on the emotional core to drive the story instead of the plot. There isn't one misstep in the cast, not one moment that rings false. Michelle Williams has the unenviable task of playing another lonely broken heart, one damaged by her husband's betrayal and dishonesty. Anne Hathaway does exceptional work with her rather underwritten character--until her final key scene shows her to be just another victim of Twist and Del Mar's love affair.One could easily blame Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar for ruining many lives, not to mention their own. But such is the tragedy of Brokeback Mountain. Two characters who had no intention of ever falling in love finding themselves gripped with the kind of passion a person would be lucky to experience even once in a lifetime. In spite of this, Del Mar gives in to fear, pulling away from the only true love he may ever know. The final climactic moments as Del Mar learns of Jack Twist's fate are poignant, underplayed, and emotionally devastating--both for him and the viewer. I can not begin to express how shattering the final moments of this film are. Annie Proulx's words captured it perfectly and I can not do it justice but with pale imitation.Common complaints and criticisms seek superficial answers for the complexities of this film's story. These characters are never pardoned for their transgressions. Del Mar's emotional abuse of his wife is a reflection of his own internal abuse. These are flawed human beings with real problems that are not easily tidied up. To say the film excuses his behavior is wrong on many levels; in fact, his behavior leads to his ultimate punishment, a life spent alone with only regret and pain to fall back on. This is the tragedy of Ennis Del Mar's choices, one we should all learn from. Love can never be explained and none is needed here.Brokeback Mountain, in my opinion, transcends itself to become more than the sum of its parts. It is one of the greatest love stories ever told, but it is also emotionally tragic. This is Shakespearean in scope, a tale of true love lost by way of fear, and one of the best American films ever produced. Hopefully we may all learn to love and overcome the fear which can often paralyze us. One day, it may be too late, handed our fate on a small postcard, forever trapped in a pit of despair and sadness. I can not think of a worse punishment for anybody, a life of internal pain and sorrow that nothing can rectify. The final moments of the film, with Del Mar alone in his trailer with nothing but his long lost love's shirt hanging in his closet, are at the same moment truly horrific and truly heart-breaking. It is a punch to the gut. The lonely broken-hearted end of all things for Del Mar.",Brokeback Mountain

Watching this movie you can perceive how hard is to be oneself: after a first time of shame and trouble, the main characters put their feeling before, changing their lives forever; but experience teaches that world don't accept who is ""different"", who is not like you, and you have to be ready to defer to people judgement, to their punishment... At the end, the message is clear: you can pretend to be who you are not, but it is impossible to deceive oneself, and when you will understand this, then at last you will not mind what people think or do: and in that moment, maybe, people will stop to judge other people by appearances!",Brokeback Mountain
421,thrix,Homo-erotic should be a suitable term,9,9 April 2006,"With ""Brokeback Mountain,"" Hollywood films has taken homosexual love and passion from laughed-at comedy to deep drama. Gyllenhaal and Ledger makes a great and believable pair of cowboys, coming closer than close during a summer job i Wyoming during the 60's. In a time of prejudices and widespread and sometimes violent homophobia, they do what they see fit - keep their love for each other a secret while outwards living a ""normal"" life with wife and kids.Scenery is stunningly beautiful in the beginning, as the environment there makes the most to show. Ang Lee continues to cleverly utilize camera angles, motives and views to enhance the visual experience.If anything negative is to be said about this film from me, I would consider the ending a bit too quick over with. From passion to sorrow in about 5 minutes is a little too steep a fall for me. 9/10 - best movie of 2005.",Brokeback Mountain
422,ZebraGreg,Moviemaker confuses lust for love in lonely shepherds. Movie fails as allegory for homosexuality in America.,5,21 January 2006,"Two hands at a sheep ranch have sex during one lonely summer, and continue the relationship into their adult life, creating love triangles with their future wives. It explores the power of homosexual lust in adult men. Later in life they face discrimination because of anti-gay stereotyping.This movie is a story about how sex between two lonely young men gets confused with love. Some interpret the their relationship as a love story and see the movie as an allegory for homosexual lovers in 21st century American society, but this is a false analogy. The men don't really love each other, they don't do the things lovers do like take care for each other, communicate through letters or phone calls, laugh at each others jokes (very little smiling in this movie), or even go fishing together. The men are motived by good sex not love, and the movie explores the power of sex to complicate life, in this case tragically. The best part is the relationship between Ennis and his wife Alma (Ledger and Williams). This relationship takes place in the real world not the pretend world on the mountain.

Michelle Williams and Ann Hathaway are incredibly good but the film belongs to Heath Ledger. I'm not going to talk about revelations or Oscar buzz, I'm just going to let you know that what he does in this film is so courageously beautiful, so truthful and so transcendental that his Ennis del Mar is bound to become a point of reference not just for us but for generations to come.",Brokeback Mountain

Ang Lee's movies always seem to have this emotional restraint that prevents the story, however tragic, from getting melodramatic and sappy, and yet he can move you deeply. He definitely knows a lot about the devise ""less is more"". He makes movies that can leave a strong impression, but this one might haunt you for a while. It haunted me, and left me with the feeling we have when a loved one departs. It is beautiful, delicate, perfectly crafted, sensual and honest. Jake Gyllenhaal's Jack Twist is so expressive, he speaks to you even when he doesn't say a word. Heath Ledger is unforgettable; his character is someone trying to contain an emotional storm inside and slowly imploding from the strain. Michelle Williams is great in the role of the nesting wife; Anne Hathaway as the business-oriented, small-town-minded southern wife manages a pretty good texan twang. The cinematography is beautiful, the music is scarce (thank goodness) and complements the movie perfectly. The story is powerful and the love scenes are too, although without being ostensibly explicit or uncomfortable. Here's my two-cent psychology: This is a movie that has the capacity to touch anyone, although some might not want to admit it. Personally, I think one must have hefty empathy issues to not be moved at all by it, regardless of their sexual orientation or mentality.",Brokeback Mountain

But this film doesn't just stop at being different, and it's not at all afraid to be slow paced and sometimes just stop the story so the characters can develop on screen. With amazing performances from Heath Ledger (Who seems unrecognisable) and Jake Gyllenhal (Who's grown up so much since Donnie Darko and The Day After Tomorrow) Brokeback offers a great story, a sad twist, fantastic acting and dialogue, some of the greatest landscapes ever seen on screen and some shocking scenes, especially with the sheep and the couple's first time.

428,dfarhie-1,"An emotional washboard that will wring you out, but it's worth it.",10,18 December 2005,"Ang Lee has taken a short story of few words and made it into a monument of deep feeling and sensitivity that will stand as one of the finest films to deal with ""the love that dare not speak its' name"". Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) is a cowboy of few words, yet his body language, his face and movements speak volumes to Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal)a man ready to set up house and live happily ever after at the drop of a hat. Unfortunately for Twist, Ennis is so haunted by a childhood incident, that the mere sharing of a grope or kiss or wink in public is anathema and must be done with frequent glancing around to make sure jaundiced eyes aren't watching. The result is an angst filled anxiety roller-coaster that causes Ennis to withdraw from life into a beer bottle and Twist to wish for a different ""happy ending"" to his life story, house and home, warm fire in the hearth and a Marlboro man to love till the cows come home. The film is full of cherished lines and situations because neither character is a font of conversation. Ledger speaks his lines from behind clenched lips, holding back imaginary chew juice, even though he smokes cigarettes and never spits. Gyllenhaal uses those amazing bedroom eyes to convey the deep love he has for Del Mar. He takes the good with the bad, the bitter with the sweet, but increasingly bitter times lie ahead for both of them. This is a classic love story of two men who married, had children, lived separate lives, but came together to share the only real love they ever knew. The wives, the kids are all incidental to the rapids whitecap-ping constantly between Jack and Ennis. Some may find this behavior selfish and immoral, but to the end, Brokeback Mountain transcends this prejudice and shows us what was probable, but never possible because of a hateful society that surrounds the characters. I highly recommend this movie to anybody with an open mind and a heart. Bravo.",Brokeback Mountain
429,yduric,"At first I was impressed, I was petrified...",1,12 July 2006,"I am paraphrasing Gloria Gaynor's lyrics of 'I Will Survive' substituting 'afraid' by 'impressed' to express the first impression this film made to me. However, as time passed by, I changed my opinion very much and came to a very different conclusion:yes, I have to admit that I was at first moved by it, probably influenced by all the hype surrounding it but... After having thought about this film a very long time, I became convinced that its great success and overall high rating is due to its tragic ending. The question is: If Ang Lee had slightly 'deviated' from Annie Proulx's short story, and put a less tragic ending (something like, for instance, Jack Twist fleeing to a supposedly gay-friendlier country, or disappearing in a big city, or something like that...), would the film have been so highly praised? I am convinced that the answer is a definite NO. The 'sacrifice' of one of the gay characters at the end (killing them both would have been too much, of course...)is certainly what a great part of the audience unconsciously demanded, in order to render the subject matter acceptable. This is precisely what fills me up with some kind of nausea, and I therefore disagree with many people who claim that this film could contribute to a greater acceptance of homosexuality. It seems, that also nowadays any gay-related film, in order to gain some success must absolutely add a so-called 'virtuous' note, in the case of 'Brokeback Mountain' one of the protagonists ending up bashed to death.Moreover, if we compare 'Brokeback Mountain' to the, in my opinion, far superior 'Mysterious Skin' (whose director was, by the way, nominated for best director alongside Ang Lee at the Independent Spirit Awards, and it is a shame that he did not win it), things become even more clear: despite of its sometimes questionable behaviour, Neil McCormick, the gay character played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt in 'Mysterious Skin' (terrific performance, by the way...) does NOT end up tragically, on the contrary... But this, of course, does certainly constitute a 'major sin' to many viewers, and this is why, very unfortunately, some very courageous films do not stand a single chance against the fundamentally homophobic weepie I just reviewed...",Brokeback Mountain

Here is the love story of two men who cannot be in love with each other, and not just because society doesn't allow it; they can barely say aloud what they are. The second half of the film slows down the momentum and gets a tad episodic, but the overall effect is extraordinary.

Roughly a week after it was released on DVD, I went in to rent it but there were no more copies available. The clerk went ahead to tell me there was just one DVD left for sell - so I purchased it, which is rare for me, but I finally had to see this epic film everyone was talking about.By the time I saw the movie, the Academy Awards had already given Oscars out and rightfully so to the incredible Ang Lee for Best Director; this story was super and translated to the screen extraordinarily also winning it an Oscar for Adapted Screenplay. I'm not sure of all the awards given that night to Brokeback Mountain but I know it also won for Original Score which was perfect for this film. The scenery was captured exquisitely via all the wonderful cinematography. Everyone attached to this project should be proud for undertaking something so bold and courageous. Nothing will change my mind concerning the fact that all the actors and actresses should have won Oscars but this was not to be so. Brokeback Mountain should have swept the awards in all categories because everyone was awesome throughout; I loved Michelle Williams as Mrs Ennis DelMar and Anne Hathaway as Mrs. Jack Twist - they were great.There are not enough words to describe Jake Gyllenhaal, who just breezed right through his role as Jack Twist with such aplomb - I always smile when I hear him sing that gospel song. Heath Ledger amazed me as the unforgettable Ennis DelMar. As I said before everyone was superb including those who supported the cast, Kate Mara who played Emma Jr was a young standout for rounding out this film.In my personal opinion Hollywood as well as the world at large may not have been ready for something of this magnitude. Brokeback Mountain is a story of true love, plain and simple. The fact that the two individuals were of the same gender was what got blown out of proportion. Not to put Crash down but no one is gonna remember it in the years to follow. Brokeback Mountain is a hallmark film that is beyond the Oscars, Hollywood or any awards system.

This is not just about a pair of gay cowboys who turn into long term lovers, because it covers facets (money, power, bad in-laws, abusive fathers, abandonment) of many relationships and standards in society. The true themes seem to be poverty and isolation. Regardless of one's personal views and fears, homosexuality has existed since the beginning of time, and it is unlikely that anyone willingly makes that choice. It must be horrible running around in life AC when 90% of the rest of the population is DC. I am a conservative, southern, Christian, straight white male and I believe that it is time for respect and tolerance on this issue.As for the Academy Awards, they must have bowed to peer pressure granting Best Picture honors to Crash. The incomparable Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall will likely be granted Oscars for later work in lieu of what happened here. They really belted out their roles with sensitivity that grabbed the audience in their seats. These may end up being the two greatest ""male"" roles in motion picture history. Heath and Jake could melt paint off the walls in this one. I felt a little worse for the Jack Twist character? Could anyone see Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt even attempting this?

440,awjonesjr,More than it seems,10,13 March 2006,"The biggest shame about BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is that it was, and may forever be known as, the ""gay cowboy movie."" Is STAR WARS ""that space opera""? VERTIGO ""that dizzy cop picture""? The phrase simply became a shorthand for the controversy -- an easy way for conservatives to dismiss it, but also for liberals to make it clear that the words ""gay"" and ""cowboy"" are not mutually exclusive. Certainly they are not. Gays are everywhere, every style and age and profession; they have a variety of characteristics, from flamboyantly flighty to brutally macho. It is no more unlikely that there were gay cowboys in 1960 than in 2005, merely that no one talked about it back then. That said, Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar are not ""gay cowboys;"" they are cowboys who happen to fall in love. Does it matter that it is with each other? Haven't stories about forbidden love been around since Tristan & Isolde, or Romeo & Juliet? Isn't the real question, How well is the story told? Does it resonate for the audience? On that score, BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a marvel of storytelling. Ang Lee uses silences as well as anyone this side of Jean-Claude Annaud, telling his story visually, and setting it up so no one person is the antagonist: Society is. This is deeply felt movie-making that transcends the label ""gay cowboy movie."" It's a career performance for Heath Ledger and a brilliant revelation for Michelle Williams. I hope everyone sees it.",Brokeback Mountain

Several times I wanted to quit but, due to all the publicity, stuck it out to the bitter end in the hopes that something happy might happen - but it didn't. May have been OK if Jack had got killed right at the beginning! I fear for anyone who sees this movie who is suffering from any sort of depression. They might want to commit suicide after sitting through this! Two marriages and families ruined by the selfish perversions of the central characters. I couldn't help wondering why anyone would want to make a movie of such a miserable story. On the good side, the background scenery and settings were stupendous. Take the story away and it would make a great travelogue. What a waste of time!",Brokeback Mountain
442,StephanieGould,One of the most poignant movies ever made,10,13 January 2006,"""Brokeback Mountain"" follows the lives of Jack Twist and Ennis del Mar throughout their lives after meeting one summer while working as sheep herders on Brokeback Mountain. It is a beautiful love story that speaks to everyone no matter what their sexual orientation or beliefs. It is something we all go through as human beings.The cast is formed perfectly with subtle performances and transformations throughout the picture. The aging process between the two main characters and their female counterparts is amazing down to their voices and looks. I would definitely recommend this film to everyone. It angers and saddens me that so much criticism has been made towards such a beautiful story and wonderful film directed by Ang Lee. Definitely go see this movie.",Brokeback Mountain
443,bzb2001,Achingly Beautiful,10,4 February 2006,"The phrase ""gay cowboy film"" is, in a large part, a misnomer. Though it is true two men wear cowboy hats and cowboy boots while riding horseback, there is scarcely a cow in the film at all. However, the phrase does get right down to the emphasis of the film. It is hard for many to comprehend the idea of two men sharing a kiss, making love, or even staring longingly into each other. It is even more strange to imagine the two as rough ranch hands.I wonder how the film will play in fifty years, will our prejudices and fears be quelled by then? Even to a 21st Century audience it is hard for many to watch the love between these two men, so it is not hard to imagine the hatred and fear within many of the characters.The archetypal ""cowboy"" is one of a mysterious nature. He wears the rim of his hat low to keep people from seeing his eyes; he scrapes mud and muck from his boots before entering a saloon where he drinks a bottle of whiskey before retiring to the cold trappings of a prostitute. He rarely says a word, and when he does it is preceded by the spit of tobacco and a hissing glare.In Ang Lee's achingly beautiful Brokeback Mountain, we see some of these actions. It is true these two must remove defilement from their boots; one of them indeed rarely says a word; another (we assume) attends the benefits of a person paid for sexual favors. But it is altogether different, Ennis and Jack seem more human in their interactions with these settings. Of course there is no saloon, since the meat of the film takes place in the 1960's and 1970's, but there are bars. And it is understood that in those bars there lurks a fear of what Jack and Ennis are, and that could get them killed.Jack and Ennis meet innocently enough, they are hired to watch after a herd of sheep on the distant hills of Brokeback Mountain. Ennis, quiet and reserved in speech and so we assume in emotion, is in charge of keeping camp. The film weaves a tapestry of domestic ritual to Ennis' daily work. Even when two men are left to their own devices in the wilderness, someone must do the cooking, preparing, cleaning and shopping. Jack's job is to watch after the herd, he is more extroverted than Ennis, so it is no surprise when he makes the first move.They do come down off the mountain. This is not a slice of life tale that exists in a few hours. The film follows them and forces them to make the choices we understand must me made. It is hard to watch some of the decisions and the hard truths they bring, but there is an understated tone throughout Brokeback Mountain that recognizes much of this could have been avoided, and that is the real tragedy that is told.So what are Jack and Ennis? Are they gay? Bisexual? Adventurously straight? What really matters is that their relationship is a dangerous taboo that can either be smothered with a come what may attitude, or more often recede to a psychological haze. Indeed the film has little to do with the sexuality of it's characters. Put any sort of ""Romeo & Juliet"" type of love and you could produce the same story. I thought, for instance, of the love between a white woman and a black man or the union of a Catholic and a Jew. These bonds are as sinful or radical as is forced by the society within which they exist.The main thread through Brokeback Mountain does not wholly explain this force of society, but it exists quietly in the background. The story moves so delicately that the thoughts of retribution for the characters' actions seem so harsh they may break the film in two. So, too, does Ennis' actions - a man of few words but, when pushed, he can unleash a horrific scene of contrary behavior.Like a bed sheet floating perfectly down into place, Brokeback Mountain is the type of film that nestles quietly waiting for someone to notice it. Heath Ledger, who is tremendous as Ennis, steals the film with a look and sound completely original yet recognizable in life. Ang Lee continues marching through Hollywood, making films his own way, each more different in treatment and look than the last. What he creates here is his best work to date, a masterpiece of tone, presentation, and spirit. **** out of ****",Brokeback Mountain
444,garboventures,The secret of this film's success,10,11 January 2006,"The secret of this film's success is how it stays with you, after the event, and indeed, its power intensifies. I hugely enjoyed watching Brokeback Mountain at the cinema - the film is a visual cinematographic treat, the acting performances are spot-on, the changing period details are subtly wrought (although Anne Hathaway's wigs are outright hilarious), the theme of forbidden love is duly frustrating and - less hyped - the class context which underpins much of the story too is extremely well done.However, there are some 'minor' problems with the film too. The film's first act up Brokeback Mountain is a masterpiece - as indeed it is the high point for Ennis and Jack for all of their lives - and the chemistry generated between the lovers is deftly handled. We warm to their characters, we want them to be happy. After Brokeback, the film has to cover a lot of time and comes across as choppy, too episodic, and by the end of the film, the pace even loses traction a little. Perhaps we would have been better off witnessing Jack's death for ourselves? Although we cannot be precisely sure just HOW he died, which is possibly why the film chooses to offer us two versions - Lureen's account and Ennis's lurid imaginings which mirror his own childhood fears of the brutalised, murdered homosexual rancher his father cruelly forced him to witness - the experience which traumatises poor Ennis for life.Interesting then that these 'problems' actually become a strength after leaving the cinema ... the episodic format enables easier 'recall'. I found moments and scenes drifting into my consciousness, often unbidden, for a few days afterwards. Similarly, the soundtrack which mainly comprises acoustic guitar riffs and vast swathes of silence, was far from impressive I felt - and even a little annoying, when each mini-episode seemed to crank up with yet another twanging reprise of the acoustic guitar. And yet, this little riff can't quite leave my mind now - and I have even come to like it. It is a cunning little device, because it formally kickstarts each little episode - both on film and in mental replay. Again, post film recall is made easier.Much praise has gone to Heath Ledger as Ennis, and much of it is deserved, as he embodies this pained, buttoned-up character, who shies from emotion and only seems to find release with Jack. But I found myself more haunted by Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist. His frustration is palpable - not just with Ennis and their circumstances - but his whole life. The turkey- carving scene with his overbearing father-in-law was superb, capturing their 'masculine' battle for patriarchal control of the family. This then was mirrored perfectly by Alma's demure new husband carving his turkey with an electric carving knife - which said everything about Alma's new squeaky-clean life without Ennis. Jake Gyllenhaal's haunted eyes powerfully recall what might have been, as he nostalgically remembers the intimate, playful relationship Ennis and Jack once enjoyed up Brokeback Mountain, even revealing how Ennis had cared so tenderly for Jack  a sudden insight into Ennis himself, his own emotional potential, which has been stymied throughout the film. This brief glimpse into past youthful happiness which has never been fully realised is tantalising and tragic, as Jack wistfully watches Ennis driving away from the mountain after a bust-up. Gyllenhaal carries this moment superbly well.One of the most poignant and important moments in the film is when Ennis explains to Jack that it is his poverty, the harsh realities of his hand-to-mouth economic situation, which also put a brake on his ability to spend more time with Jack. The contrast between their circumstances is stark. Jack can afford to take time off work to visit his 'fishing buddy'; Jack works for the family firm and is unlikely to lose his job. But poor Ennis has had to sacrifice much more to be with Jack. Jack brings swish camping gear to their mountain rendezvous, subtle signification of his increasingly middle- class status, which further alienates him from the non-aspirational Ennis who is socially entrenched. Indeed, so rigid is his conservatism, it has become his personal prison. Ennis always stays the same.Jack's wife, played by Anne Hathaway, is also superb - and in fact impressed me much more than Michelle Williams who plays Ennis's long-suffering wife Alma, and seems to be garnering more critical plaudits. Williams was OK, but she never moved me, and I feel her role demanded that kind of response.Did the film as a whole move me in the way it appears to have affected so many others? Frankly no - but this is probably a strength and not a failing. Ang Lee has not opted for mawkish sentimentality - and he had many options to do so. A completely melodramatic emotional collapse from Ennis at the end would have served this point well - but he chooses instead to steer clear of overt emotionalism, and allows the story to tell itself, the characters to 'be'. The film thus feels realistic, rather than voyeuristic - and political messages are never forced home with undue punch and pomposity. The narrative solely charts the emotional journeys of these two simple, everyday men - it is never hyperbolised, messy, unnecessary but tightly controlled, under-stated, even spartan. Much is left unsaid, and the film is the better for it. One of the most glorious 'characters' of the piece is the awe-inspiring scenery of ""Wyoming""/ Alberta in the film - the manifold wide-lensed shots, the dramatic colours, the luminous skies, the rolling clouds, the clear blue rivers and even the vast flocks of sheep texturing the landscape - these images stay with you.8.5 out of 10.",Brokeback Mountain
445,Edd-N-Furter,Love is a force of nature: unpredictable and ungovernable,10,7 April 2010,"1963. Ennis Del Mar, a ranch-hand and Jack Twist a rodeo cowboy in search for a better work and money decide to work as sheepherders in Brokeback Mountain (located in Wyoming), what they ignore is that this job is about to change their lives forever. This is the base of award-winning short story written by Annie Proulx Brokeback Mountain, adapted to the big screen in 2005 by Larry McMurtry and Dianna Ossana and directed by Oscar winning director Ang Lee.Instead of focusing on the ""gay"" angle, Proulx's story and McMurtry & Ossana's masterful screenplay narrate the emotional journey of two people who love each other, but are unable to stay together due to fear of losing everything (even their lives) if they're ever discovered (avoiding morbid and gratuitous situations/scenes that could have spoiled what the movie's trying to say). Ennis is a quiet, distant man who cannot express his feelings as openly as he'd like to. Jack, on the other hand is a cheerful, expressive guy and needs to feel affection and being cherished by someone. Even if their tempers are completely different, what Jack and Ennis share will keep them going throughout the years in spite of knowing they might not end up together at all. Is the acting, nevertheless what gives this movie a very special dimension, especially considering the main characters are young and they have to be played by very talented actors. Ang Lee knows this and trust entirely in the cast and he wasn't mistaken: Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams as the young wives of the main characters provide an unanticipated humanity to roles that could have been simple adornments to the story. Jake Gyllenhaal proves once again his extraordinary potential as Jack Twist, the lovesick, charismatic man who wants to share the rest of his life with Ennis in a place where they can't hide their love. And the late Heath Ledger, in a performance that's about to become legendary along with his Joker as Ennis: a man whose silence seems to condemn him to loneliness, with a prodigious body language Ledger echoes the most iconic Bergmanian characters. Brokeback Mountain is a movie about love, but it is also about showing how fear is the greatest obstacle when it comes to love someone.",Brokeback Mountain
446,falcondj,Not gonna support an agenda because I've been guilt-tripped into it.,4,18 January 2016,"First off, I support gay rights all around, and I have several gay, lesbian, and bi friends. That being said, I thought this movie was dull and extremely boring...not to mention predictable. Now, the only reason I decided to come here and review the flick after this long is because, even though I watched this movie nearly 2 years ago, I still hear about it in bad and good ways. But then I realized nobody thinks it's okay...they either love it or hate it solely based on their views about homosexuality, particularly male homosexuality, because I guarantee if this movie was about two females it'd be viewed completely differently. Anyways, when I got here, I saw the lowest user score was 8/10, and sorry, that's simply not true. To me, that many people rating this movie that high sort of tailors to the ""look at me, I'm not prejudice against gay people"" fad that's been huge for a few years now. I've actually met people who strive to hang out with their ""gay friends"" just for appearances. ""Hey, look at me, I have a gay friend, so you know I'm cool."" Anyway, as someone with gay friends whom I've had in my life forever, I can only dish this movie a 4/10. It's worth a watch, but it is in no way the masterpiece it's been praised for being. If this was about a straight couple in the same situation, it wouldn't have even made it to theaters.",Brokeback Mountain
447,ricbigi,A Film About the Power of Love,10,20 February 2006,"BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is both a tragic love story and an indictment of bigoted, conservative, Bible-waving America. It shows us in careful detail the development of a special relationship between two men, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, cowboys hired to tend to a flock of sheep in the mountains of Wyoming during the summer of '63. Based on the short-story by Annie Proulx, which was adapted to the screen by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, the Ang Lee film is a masterwork of restraint, subtle yet firm, stark and ultimately indelible in the power of its images. Lee shows us how his two characters are victims of their home environments, limited by poverty and the effects of a conservative upbringing that is psychologically destructive and dehumanizing. Ennis is particularly affected by his personal history, which leads him to be uptight, guarded, emotionally boxed-in; in spite of the hardships of his past and present, Jack is better able to deal with his feelings and express them, both verbally and physically. Set against the splendors of nature, the awakening of love between these men is one of the most breathtakingly beautiful sequences in film history. Never before have I witnessed a film that portrays so well the yearning for love as it imposes itself upon spirits repressed by years of conservative upbringing. And when Ennis and Jack make love for the first time, they are like two cougars mating. All their subsequent love scenes have a sense of urgency, they are violent and lyrical. There is great purity in these men. These are lovers who are not touched by the degrading effects of voluptuousness. As life starts to separate them, one keeps hoping that they will have a chance to be happy together. Ennis's reluctance and inability to fully commit to their relationship eventually brings about the tragic ending. The murder of Jack Twist gives the final scenes an eerie feeling, a special quality of despair that is all the more poignant due to the sober treatment that each individual image is given. BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a fundamentally important work. Ang Lee has been justly praised for his sure touch, his highly dignified yet bold and realistic vision of the material. The acting is superlative in every sense. Heath Ledger does wonderful things to express his character's introversion, his deep sensibility beneath a rugged, taciturn, insensitive facade. Jake Gyllenhaal is admirably adept at showing his character's longing for Ennis. His Jack is a jewel of a man: brave, generous, warm, willing to defy society in order to affirm his right to love Ennis. The entire cast deserves recognition for its impeccable ensemble work. Screenplay, cinematography, art direction, music, all contribute to making BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN a superior piece of cinema. Finally, I have the feeling that Brokeback Mountain was indeed the perfect place for these lovers to exist and be together. Its pristine beauty is the perfect setting for the story of a love that is as pure as nature itself.",Brokeback Mountain

And not just the nature shots, there are many great / memorable shots on this film. This movie is visually great.In our life, we may encounter unexpected things. Loved ones can be gone just any day, all of the sudden. Just like Delmar learned Jack died on a normal day, suddenly. Things like this make this movie feel real and authentic.I also view this movie as a story of loneliness. Delmar played by Ledger falls in love twice, and leaves the lover twice as well. He never gets to live with Jack together. At the end of the movie, he is still living alone, with his daughter visiting him occasionally. He misses dead Jack, with his jacket and the picture of the mountain in his closet.

But it is much easier to portray your impression of a real person than it is to create a character from scratch. Heath Ledger, as Ennis Del Mar, is one of the deepest, complex, most memorable characters that I have ever seen portrayed, on the screen or on the stage. I don't think he said 50 words throughout the whole movie but the way he carried himself, the LACK of movement that he used, really made this character come to life. I had to put the subtitles on so I could see what he was saying because the manner in which he spoke made it nearly impossible to understand what he was saying. That made Ennis all the more real.The relationship between Ennis and Jack was so.......God, I don't have the words to describe it. I have never been so moved in my entire life.

452,grandenchilada,Happy Trails,8,17 October 2006,"It is my duty to report that I have mixed feelings about the Mountain: I was ecstatic to see that the man responsible for the stunning, sensitive cinematography is my incredibly talented countryman Rodrigo Prieto. Prieto has worked on Amores Perros, Eight Mile and many other splendidly lit movies. In Brokeback Mountain he reins in his spectacular color effects and lights this film in a beautiful, tender, unobtrusive way. The same can be said for Ang Lee's sensitive, graceful, touching direction. He has a wonderful way with actors and all of them are quite terrific. The mood is elegiac and tragic and beautiful and managed to move me deeply. But I kept wishing for a number of things: 1. That they would not keep cutting away to a full moon, as if we were watching a documentary on the life of the wild coyote. 2. That Jake Gyllenhall, who is a subtle, delightful actor on whom I have had an enormous crush since Donnie Darko, would get his cowboy accent straighter. And that I would believe more that he is actually a cowboy. My dream casting for the film would probably have been Joaquin Phoenix and Peter Sarsgaard, both of which radiate something more mysterious and elusive and who I love to death in everything. 3. I wish I liked Heath Ledger, who is wonderful in the film, more than I did. Hype is evil. (How come the Aussies and the English always nail the US regional accents better than the homegrown talent?) 4. It would have been nice to see the cowboys rough it out a little more. I would'nt have lasted a day and a half eating beans in the great outdoors, but for instance, when they decide to kill for lunch, instead of a demure cut to them already enjoying their dinner, I would have liked to see a little bit more of how they got to extract the meat. 5. I wish that the writers did not have to resort to intimations of terrible violence against homosexuals in order to make the point, which they already make beautifully, that the prejudice against homosexuality is terribly pointless and stupid and tragic. Just the fact that two people go through such self-denial, destruction, deception and sadness because of social prejudice is enough to drive home the point. However, I understand that I may get it, but others less enlightened may not. Still, Brokeback Mountain is a movie worth pondering. The women in it are wonderful, particularly Michelle Williams, as Heath Ledger's wife and the amazing Roberta Maxwell, who steals the film in one scene as Jake's mom. I hope that audiences in multiplexes all over the homophobic world will approach this movie with the grace and thoughtfulness it deserves. Since I have no faith in mankind, I seriously doubt it.",Brokeback Mountain

454,PizzicatoFishCrouch,The Mountain that Broke Me.,10,11 March 2006,"The year is 1963, and Ennis Del Mar (played by Heath Ledger), a ranch hand, and Jack Twist (the ever delectable Jake Gyllenhaal), a rodeo cowboy, meet on Brokeback Mountain in a summer job hoarding sheep. It's the classic chalk and cheese story. Ennis struggles to mumble his own name, and Jack, the charismatic charmer, lives to communicate. Over time a slow, steady bond forms, which leads suddenly and surprisingly into a physical relationship. After Brokeback they leave to follow their own lives  Ennis marries a sweet, shy girl, Alma (Michelle Williams) and Jack marries into money through rodeo princess Lureen (Anne Hathaway), but the memory of Brokeback Mountain is one that engulfs the men's lives for the next 20 years.The opening half hour, in which Ennis and Jack are introduced to the audience as well a each other, is shot in a beautiful way that, whilst paying homage to the classic Westerns (with the fusions of the skylines and the grass, as well as the classic close ups of the eyes), has a dreamlike state of its own that bears closer resemblance of the 90s Art flicks. The colours and images presented to us by the cinematographer and utterly stunning, and the music, though used sparsely, is wonderful. It is impossible not to get sucked in to the story.Adapted from E. Annie Proulx's short story, screenwriters Diana Ossana and Larry McMurtry have created a masterful script, one that stays completely true to the source material, yet combines some filmic techniques of their own, such as the foreshadowing: (Ennis moans over his lost shirt and we get a lingering close-up of Jack's face; it is later revealed that Jack took his shirt), and adding in many more scenes - some that give the characters any additional depth that may have been lacking in the story (the masculinity of the relationship is emphasised with an antler shooting session), some just for the enjoyability value (Jack driving a tractor with his son is a pricelessly cute moment).Director Ang Lee has coaxed superb performances out of his young actors. Despite all the hype surrounding Heath Ledger's performance, I was still astonished by his wordless, bruised performance as the brutal Ennis. Michelle Williams shines too, as the long-suffering wife, who has seen her husband with another man, but cannot bring herself to understand what it all means. Even Anne Hathaway, so mediocre in the Princess Diaries films, impresses as the disappointed Lureen. But the star of the show is Jake Gyllenhaal, in what must be a career-best turn. His doe-eyed portrayal of Jack is everything like how I'd expected him to be  vivacious in life, tender in love, brilliant on screen. The fact that Gyllenhaal is so 100% adorable just makes his change into a bitter, resentful old man even more depressing. Essential to the film is Jack and Ennis' chemistry, and Gyllenhaal and Ledger have risen to the task commendably. Never before in a film have two actors had such amazing chemistry.To label Brokeback Mountain as ""that gay cowboy movie"" is a horrendously cruel oversimplification. For one, intimate scenes aside, the film is every bit as heterosexual as Casablanca, maybe more so. More importantly, this film is not just a 130-minute mediation on gays. No stone is left unturned in terms of their relationship  we see how the women are affected by the relationship (in a gruelling scene Alma confronts her husband on his ""fishing trips"") and we see the suffering caused by the relationship. However much we're rooting for Jack and Ennis to make it, something tells us that they won't make it, yet the heartbreak, when it comes, is no less devastating.There are a few scenes in the film that have really lingered with me. One is when Jack stands by the fire, half-asleep, and Ennis cuddles him and starts whispering sweet nothings into his ear. The affection and gentle charge of that scene makes it utterly unforgettable. Another scene is when Jack, sensing Ennis' frustration at having to leave Brokeback, playfully throws a lasso over him, which leads to a fight. To me, this scene encompasses everything the film represents  Jack's desire to make the relationship work and make Ennis happy, and Ennis' constant pushing him away. The same could go for almost any forbidden relationship.Brokeback Mountain is by no means an uplifting film. Although the first half-hour has a light, jovial tone to it, the rest of the film escalates into despair, and every scene with Jack and Ennis, however sweet, bears a sense of impending doom. However, Brokeback Mountain is essentially a tribute to love, and the goodness of love. Many people have found solace in this film, and this is because, like Jack and Ennis, everyone has had a love they could not keep. Age differences, religion, class and the opinion's of other people are just a few reasons that lovers cannot be together. But Brokeback Mountain tells us not to shy away from love, because it is the most potent, wonderful feeling. Embrace it, and embrace the movie, a resounding triumph in every way; one of the best pieces of cinema to come along in recent years.",Brokeback Mountain
455,spottedreptile,"Huge cultural impact comes from small, quality film.",9,11 January 2006,"I worry that with all the buzz and hysteria surrounding Brokeback Mountain, that audiences will go to see it expecting a vast sweeping saga, with epic scope and numerous Oscar-bait scenes like every other movie that has been an Oscar front-runner over recent years.Brokeback Mountain isn't like that at all. It's a small, intimate and very personal film which starts off quietly and grows subtly and slowly, into a totally engrossing drama of human relationships and tragic loss. The emotional punch it produces is not lessened by the filmmakers' not manipulating your feelings. Instead the film meanders along quietly and then when you're not looking, it socks you right in the gut, rather than eking tears from your eyes.I've watched so many films recently that use sledgehammer tactics to drive their messages home, or try too hard to wring every conceivable emotion out of my soul, that it's very refreshing to find a film which lets the audience do a lot of the thinking for themselves. You have to watch each scene, you have to listen, and sometimes you have to do your own working out. It's a challenge, but one which pays off big time. You may go home thinking, yeah, okay good movie I suppose, and then find you can't get it out of your head for the next week.There isn't an area where Brokeback Mountain is weak. The script is taut, the acting is inspired and the photography is gorgeous everywhere. An awful lot is conveyed by silence, and gestures or looks instead of words. These characters don't emote on the surface. They don't babble on  they are taciturn men. And it works really, really well. They become so engrossing that it's difficult to stop thinking about their fate and speculating what might have happened, what a certain scene meant, why a character did so and so.Don't expect the film to give you all the answers either. Just go along for the ride and revel in the simple beauty of pure human storytelling. And by the end you may have forgotten that Ennis and Jack were gay, all you will remember is the anguish of what might have been.",Brokeback Mountain
456,ctodd1000,This film has moved me like no other...,10,14 January 2006,"I have just seen the film ""Brokeback Mountain"" here in NYC, and this film has moved me like no other. I have looked up pertinent information on IMDb.com and am including it here, in case others have not noticed the original author or screenwriter's information.The screenplay, by Larry McMurtry (""Lonesome Dove""), was based on a short story by E. Annie Proulx first published in the New Yorker in 1997. Proulx won the 1994 Pulitzer Prize for fiction for ""The Shipping News,"" another favorite film of mine.""Her short story ""Brokeback Mountain,"" which contains a character who is killed in a Wyoming gay-bashing, was published in The New Yorker in 1997, almost exactly one year before the real-life murder of gay Wyoming man Matthew Shepard. Proulx, who lived close to where Shepard was beaten, was called to but not selected for jury duty for the trial of Shepard's murders.""Proulx published her first novel at age 56. She was born in 1935 and McMurtry was born in 1936, so they are both around 70 years old. Maybe it's not all over for us yet!I have read McMurtry's about cowboys and the west, and as the screenwriter here, he does the same terrific job he always does. It was filmed in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, so the scenery is stunning and well worth a trip to a ""real big screen theater"" which I haven't been to in many years.I feel this film will change this country and this culture in ways we never could imagine, and it's long overdue. Tolerance and Understanding, or at least just ""tolerance"" would go a long way for all people to begin to get along and to live ""free."" Free from hate and fear, for starters.""To enter heaven, one must bring it with them."" Yours, Catherine Todd",Brokeback Mountain
457,lkl6411,Outstanding acting but not an epic movie,7,16 January 2006,"Any movie that keeps a consistent 8.0 or above score on IMDb must be outstanding, right? I hesitated to see Brokeback Mountain because I'm not into same-sex relationships, but I'd heard the acting was superb and the cinematography beautiful. I wasn't disappointed with either of those 2 aspects of the movie. All of the actors did a fantastic job portraying their characters. And, to my surprise, it was the heterosexual sex scenes that left me wondering why they included what they did (bare breasts on both female actresses-totally unnecessary in this movie) The homosexual scenes were treated with delicacy and discretion in my opinion.The movie made you think and yes, it did make me tear up in 2 spots. Love is love, I guess.I wish things had ended differently and the characters hadn't lived such tortured lives. But that's up to the writer! This movie wasn't a ""life-changer"" or one I ""won't be able to get out of my mind"" as some reviewers felt. It had poignant moments but it wasn't quite ""epic"". I do hope Heath Ledger wins some awards. Jake Gyllenhal deserves recognition too. Brave men to take on these roles.",Brokeback Mountain
458,Leparsdon,Ho Hum,6,17 April 2006,"Honestly I really don't understand what the hype is about this film. I went in with the best of intentions and came out truly disappointed. What I was left with was a mediocre story that tried to be more than what it was. Mediocre acting as well as dialog. Noting really special about this other than it featured two straight actors playing homosexuals and quite unsuccessfully at that. Anne Hathaway gave a nice performance and the scenery was beautiful, but as far as Oscar worthy anything this definitely wasn't it. Heath Ledger struggled with his dialect and for me his performance was lifeless and dead. He left me wishing that they had cast a more vibrant actor to the role who could truly convey the pain and confliction that his character was going through but that didn't happen and the rest of the film didn't really give much to hold anyones attention. Boring and slow. Not worth it.",Brokeback Mountain
459,Bunty-at-IMDB,Touching and beautiful,8,30 August 2010,"Brokeback Moutain is a very brave attempt to showcase the whole life of a gay couple, their dilemmas and stereotypes and homophobia of the society towards them. Ang Lee has created something very unique and simplistic romantic film.Script writers Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana have achieved a remarkable adaptation of Annie Proulx's short story. The dialogs are very well written and the characterization is just outstanding. The story follows two life and times of two cowboys - Ennis (played by Heath Ledger) and Jack (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) who have their own children and wives but they love each other. This unusual bond between them forms the crux of the story. Over the time, they maintain their secret relationship from the world. Kudos for both of the Lead Actors - Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal really appear is if they are in love with each other. They have wonderfully done justice to their characters. The bittersweet romance between both of the lead actors is a delight to watch. Performance of Michelle Williams - who played Ennis' wife is also amazing. Her portrayal of a woman who knows his husband is a gay and her ultimate decision is very beautifully played by Michelle.The film is beautifully shot. Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography is very flamboyant. Filmed in eye captivating locations in Canada, the wide shots of beautiful mountains and landscapes are breathtaking. Music by Gustavo Santaolalla is pretty much minimalistic - just a guitar playing throughout the movie but it is very melodious and lovely to hear and it worked like a charm in the film. Ang Lee's direction, as mentioned above is very clear cut and he is on the focus throughout the movie.In the end, the film will be a remarkable landmark in history of American cinema. It will probably change the view of some people - The film is not for just gays, perhaps it is for every person who believes in equal rights for everyone. And of course if you want to see something unusual, but yet very touching romantic film - Brokeback Mountain is for you.8.5/10",Brokeback Mountain
460,nycrules,Eat It Up Conservative Middle America and Choke on It!,10,27 January 2006,"Let me just start out by saying this was not one of the best movies I have ever seen. It wasn't life changing or so moving for me that I wept by the movie's end. At the same time, I do think Heath Ledger's acting performance is worth high praise as well as Ang Lee's direction. I love this movie for sticking it to the Conservative and Religious Right in this country because they asked for it. That's why I tell everyone I know to see this film. The political landscape swings to the right and something in our culture such as this movie becomes a smashing mainstream success! Otherwise it would have been just a fairly good movie seen mostly by a gay audience. Instead the movie has taken the red states by storm and has everybody talking. Thank you Carl Rove! Thank you George W. and the rest of your camp! The result of the 2004 election helped pave the way for this kind of homo mania, and there is a lot more to come! Would it have been like this if certain right wing politics hadn't played their dirty hand to use gay rights as a wedge issue to get Bush re-elected in 2004? Of course not! If you are going to oppress a minority such as gays and lesbians as second class citizens denying them all of the same rights as everyone else, expect much more of this. It's a nice big man cream pie in the face of the Ann Coulters out there and their extreme right agenda! I could be wrong, but I believe this movie wasn't made for political reasons. However timing is everything. It just happened to come out no pun intended at a time when it had unprecedented impact. This movie was not made to titillate. It just happens to be a story based on the fact two ordinary men CAN love each other more than just ""fishin buddies"" but a lot of small minds don't want them to. For that reason, this movie has more than artistic merit and earned a place in American film-making history.",Brokeback Mountain
461,selenedm999,over-hyped melodrama,5,2 February 2007,"I like Annie Proulx. I like Larry McMurtry (try The Last Picture Show). I like Ang Lee. I like Jake Gyllenhaal.So why didn't this movie live up to the sum of its parts? On the plus side, it was well-acted, and beautifully shot. I would have been happy with a docudrama about sheep ranchers, really, because I found the animals MUCH more interesting than their human counterparts.On the down side...Honestly, if Jake had been a woman, the movie would have been boring and formulaic. And these aren't people I care about in real life, so I doubly don't care to watch them in a movie. Plus, they didn't age in the fifteen or twenty year span of the film, which undermined its credibility.Now, if anyone reads this, I know I'll be flamed as a homophobe, but my love of ""gay-themed"" movies is what sent me to see it in the first place, expecting a great deal more than I got. If you want good ""gay""-ness, try Torch Song Trilogy or Hedwig and the Angry Inch, which are about compelling people and their relationships.",Brokeback Mountain

463,knows_film,A Perfect Movie with something for everyone,10,6 February 2006,"Brokeback Mountain.A movie about many things. But for me one thing stood out. And that was the sheep. Being from New Zealand you can appreciate my love for sheep.All the sheep gave really good performances playing sheep. I felt the cast of 700 sheep did a fantastic job portraying 117,000 sheep. Not one time was I able to distinguish which sheep were used for particular shots. Now that is what I call method acting.Casting did a great job getting just the right sheep for the meatier roles. I hear some sheep were flown in at last minute from all over. But credit to crew who obviously had to pull strings to get such a great ensemble. And a pat on the back for the producers who showed guts in hiring not only the best sheep, but taking a gamble on some of the unknowns too.Ang Lee I feel really captured the essence of sheep.He also captured that other stuff too.But really good job on the sheep. I had lamb chops for dinner that night and I must say they tasted just that little bit better. Thanks Ang!",Brokeback Mountain
464,Vanyel,"Lovely scenery, story a bit weak",7,18 December 2005,"The most outstanding part of this movie is the outdoor cinematography --- it really shows the beauty of the back country. The story, however, is stretched too thin. All you get is a brief peek to see that ""yes, this is happening"", but you don't really *feel* it happening. To be fair, I got the same feeling from the short story when I read it a few years ago too, and it is a hard thing to do. But that's what this story is about, so it has to succeed on that level for me to give it a 10. The acting was a bit uneven as well: Heath Ledger gave the most moving performances in the movie, though the first breakdown scene didn't quite pull me into it. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway also get a chance to make us feel for them; they pull it off well, though Anne's scene has no background as to why she should feel that way. I see in the ratings that it's a ""love or hate"" situation, and I think those people are voting for or against homosexuality and/or Ang Lee, not the movie itself --- it isn't terrible, but it isn't perfect either.",Brokeback Mountain
465,demonsquipster,gay cowboys stay superior,10,4 October 2019,"Heartbreaking, incredible, absolutely blew me away. it deserves all the attention it gets. Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger really went ""screw homophobia"" with this movie. this movie stands apart from typical romance movies. the romance between Jack and Ennis feels so pure and real, due to both the genuine performances by Gyllenhaal and Ledger, and the incredible script. no other movie (that I've seen, at least) has conveyed the importance of acceptance and the impact of societal homophobia like this movie has. the casting was perfect. no one else could have made Jack and Ennis work the way Gyllenhaal and Ledger did. on the outside, it seems easy to make fun of, with the whole 'gay cowboys' thing, and straight people's favourite: ""I wish I knew how to quit you."" but this movie is so much more than that. it's painful, emotional, sensual, and beautiful. it's so much more than just a romance movie or a gay movie. if only people would bother to see it as such.",Brokeback Mountain
466,Fielga,I was absolutely positive that I would LOVE this movie!,5,27 May 2012,"I desperately wanted to adore this film and defend it against the haters. A huge fan of both leading actors and an LGBT advocate, I thought that absolutely nothing could stop this from becoming my all time favorite film. I'm in awe by how wrong I was.I really don't see the appeal, as much as it pains me to say it. The cinematography is stunning, but that's about as far as it goes. The plot was surprisingly thin and I didn't see anything remarkable in any of the performances. Not that they were bad necessarily (except Ledger's. I adore him, but he was just awful this time, I had to turn on the captions to understand what he was saying), but everything was underwhelming and the majority of the characters were hard to tolerate at all, like nails on a chalk board, to speak nothing of trying to actually care about them.I do understand this movie's social relevance of course, but as unpopular as this is to say, it's just not really that great of a movie. I think they had a great thing going, but somewhere between the concept and the premier, it all collapsed and left something actually sadly forgettable in its wake.But such is merely my own personal opinion. And although I do have strange taste, I really feel like this is a fair summary of a (sorry) pretty dull movie.",Brokeback Mountain
467,naillon-2,Faces of love,10,7 March 2006,"This film doesn't just deal with the love of the two main characters for each other; it also deals with the love of family and friends. Starting in 1963, when homosexuality was never discussed, and ending in the early 1980s, at around the time AIDS was becoming a well-known disease, the topic of sexual orientation is rarely mentioned due to the stiflingly conservative, narrow-minded milieu in which the characters live. Even toward the end of the film, when homosexuality is accepted in many circles, the small towns in Wyoming and Texas are still, in many ways, stuck in 1963.Heath Ledger was truly remarkable as Ennis Del Mar, a man who has never learned to show emotion - with the notable exception being anger. He is so locked within himself, afraid to ask for what he wants, afraid even to ask HIMSELF what he wants, that he merely exists; he only comes to life on Brokeback Mountain. Ledger is so good that I truly believed - and was thoroughly exasperated with - his character; he lives in immense fear of the truth being revealed (with some reason, given his memory of the time his father took him to see the battered corpse of an alleged gay man); he can't express love, kindness, or friendship; he can't imagine a world or a life outside the narrow, dusty confines of rural Wyoming.Gyllenhaal, as Jack Twist, is the one with whom I sympathized. He knows what he wants, and whom he loves (though neither man uses the word ""love"" toward the other). He admits that he and his wife don't love each other, and he wants to live with Ennis, who refuses to entertain the thought. Unlike Ennis, who doesn't feel much emotion toward his daughters, Jack is very close to his own son. Jack is thwarted by Ennis' inability to communicate, and by the love he feels for Ennis that keeps him near Wyoming. Clearly, Jack would be far better off if he left Ennis and moved to a more liberal environment, but the viewer knows that, just as in real life, Jack will not leave.The two actors do an amazing job aging approximately twenty years; I'm not speaking of the makeup, but of the body language. Ledger, towards the end of the film, moves with the stiff motions you would expect from a man who'd been a cowboy for his entire adult life. Gyllenhaal's motions are also slower, though his life has been one of greater comfort (thanks to his marriage to a rich woman).This is a real triumph of film language. Kudos to all involved.",Brokeback Mountain

The living conditions in the mountain are mot very simples and give opportunities of connection between the two men. One evening, after drinking too much, they sleep together and have homosexual relations. This is the beginning of a love story between them. But they don't wish these relations to be regular, only one time a year and only on this mountain. Several years later, both of them are married. Ennis is always a cowboy and his wife, Alma, works into a supermarket and they have two children. Jack has married Cassie, the daughter of a rich farm equipment seller, and they have a boy. Nevertheless, Ennis and Jack continue once a year to spend some time together under the pretext of fishing parties. This relationship will be the reason of rupture of Ennis' couple and perturbation of Jack's sexual life. But both men must not ever forget love, which has tied them, and that even Jack's death cannot destroys. The filming of that movie is very beautiful with splendid landscapes and the acting of the two major actors, Jake Gillenhaal and Heath Ledger, is remarkable, true and touching. With such a difficult subject put on the screen, Ang Lee' movie is full of correctness and simplicity.",Brokeback Mountain

The end of the film is one of the most gut wrenching things i've ever seen in a film before. Jake and Heath really are convincing in the roles and i could see this happening due to the realness of the script. Ang Lee really out did himself with this movie, its beautiful yet still believable and very moving which is a mix you don't find very often in movies. So anyone who says i don't want to watch that film kits about gay guys, you should just put that thought behind you because i think this film has the potential to be loved by everybody and anybody who's truly willing to give it a chance.To me this film will become a classic and will always be up there with the likes of 'Gone With The Wind' and 'Titanic'.",Brokeback Mountain
470,robertlauter25,Well made but with no mainstream appeal despite the hype.,7,1 July 2013,"Brokeback mountain is a character study. It has no antagonist or protagonist, unless you consider society and history's established view on homosexuality as evil. The visuals are spectacular, and heath ledger deserves credit, he is a rare talent. The director should have edited the film more sedately. The scenes involving sex are uneven which reeks of agenda. If you want to show vivid graphic homosexual scenes, don't chop the heterosexual scenes before they become vivid and graphic. There are also scenes involving Ledger's gay lover that are completely irrelevant and silly. This movie has no mass appeal it was allowed to run in theaters for over 4 months. The Hollywood establishment was orgasmic, and it was lavished with award after award at the expense of other far more deserving films of the year, including other romance movies like Must Love Dogs, blockbusters with opposing messages such as The Chronicles of Narnia and even The 40 year old virgin which where far more memorable than brokeback mountain. 2005 was a terrible year for movies, especially for dramas. Perhaps it was by design, nothing Hollywood does these days surprises me. The characters aren't likable, but as I said it's a character study and it was well made. That much said it is completely inappropriate for Hollywood to prop it up in an obvious attempt to give it mainstreen appeal, far better movies have been yanked after a month. It has no mainstream appeal. Strictly for the artistically astute.",Brokeback Mountain
471,Mr. D,Easier to admire than to enjoy,7,17 September 2006,"It's going to be very hard to put forth an 'objective' opinion about this film. It has crossed over from being just a movie to a cultural milestone that is regarded and lauded as one of the best love stories out there.I'm sorry, but I don't think it is.Despite the strong acting of the leads and the stunning cinematography of Wyoming, the central story felt rushed and incomplete. There was little to no explanation or backstory on why these two felt so strongly for each other. Sure, they had sex, but as many straight and gay people can tell you, that in and of itself doesn't lead to a lengthy relationship where each party pines for the other and awaits their time together. In addition, the movie abruptly jumps forward years in time with nothing more than a cut. Then the ending pops up out of nowhere and felt like a complete tear jerking cheat. I understand what Ang Lee was trying to do, but couldn't he and the screenwriters have come up with something more original than having a character killed off? Personally, I would've found it much more devastating if both parties remained alive, but realized that their dream could not come true due to the outside forces aligned against them. All of this feels like the result of an editor that was too scissor happy. It's rare to say this, but this film needed to be longer. It needed to explore the depths of these characters more than it did.Now I'm sure that I'm going to be branded as a homophobe by some simply because I didn't think this movie was the greatest film ever, much like disliking ""The Passion of the Christ"" makes you an atheist. However, I am trying to separate the film itself from the taboos and societal barriers that it broke. As a film that actually depicts a male on male relationship without resorting to stereotypes or cheap comedy, its impact is huge. It's too bad that the film itself just isn't all that great as a piece of pure cinema. I am sincerely hopeful that this film acts as a springboard for mainstream movies to deal openly with this topic. Eventually we may see a 'gay' romance movie that finds all the nuances and depth of character that ""Brokeback Mountain"" missed.So, to summarize. This film's release will hopefully user in a new era where homosexual relationships are treated with the same fairness as hetero ones, and the boundary that has been placed between 'traditional' and 'progressive' morality will disappear. But as a film, and judged outside of it's societal impact, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is an attractive, yet incomplete film that fails to adequately explain why these two grow to care for each other so much that it consumes them alive. It is and always will be remembered as the first mainstream 'gay romance' movie, but this historical fact is not enough to elevate the movie itself above the level of 'well meaning, but flawed'.",Brokeback Mountain

He walks like a Wyoming guy, talks like one, stands like one, etc. I don't know how he did it. But he did.Don't get me wrong: this is a very solid movie, which manages to appeal to everyone, although it would seem at first that it is hard to relate to (unless you are a gay cowboy in the closet).

What can I say that the newspapers and magazines haven't already said a thousand times over? Ledger is a ripe young actor truly flexing his acting muscles for the first time and stunning us with his skill for someone so young. Lee, as usual, teases out genuine emotions and life-like struggles--the fear, longing, and sadness in this tragedy. This is Lee's work at its best. The fine adaptation of Annie Proulx's short story by McMurty and Ossana is highly commendable. They carefully painted a portrait of life in 1960s Signal, Wyoming, setting a very realistic stage for the drama to unfold. All in all, it's impossible for such a formidable group of people not to produce a marvelous work of art. The cast, screen writers, director, and even novelist each rank among the finest in their respective fields.

It helps that the point of reference here is a story by Ms. Proulx and that Larry McMurtry wrote the screenplay. But it is, first and last, an Ang Lee film and it reveals the maestro at the summit of his craft.In brief, two guys find in each other the love of all time but can't make a life together from it. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal turn in the best performances of their young careers. They are remarkable. So is the Wyoming landscape. Too bad that all those jokes about ""a gay cowboy movie"" on late night TV will make a lot of people shy away. This movie can't be pigeonholed.

476,limau,An observation,10,28 February 2006,"It is perhaps in the nature of IMDb that even the best movie is likely to be given poor reviews and very low votes by some. I have seen that for many good films, but for Brokeback Mountain, a film which is critically acclaimed and widely lauded, this effect is particularly striking. It is often useful to look at the hostile as well as the favourable reviews in order to get a more rounded view of the film, but in the case of Brokeback Mountain, it is worth looking more closely at the hostile ones to see what is happening. The bad reviews generally are of the two following types - 1) Complaints that the movie is too slow and boring, not enough characterisation of the main or minor characters, too few words spoken, etc. It is perhaps unfortunate that ""slow and boring"" is always the criticisms that any thoughtful movie is likely to attract, some people simply won't make any effort to understand a movie that doesn't have constant action or flashy cgi. They may also expect everything to be explicit spelt out so they don't need to work out what is happening by themselves. Brokeback Mountain is therefore unsatisfactory for them, it being largely about the private emotional lives of the protagonists, much of which is left unspoken. However, for those who are more thoughtful, they will find a beautiful story, simple yet complex, sparsely told yet highly emotional in its effect.2) People who haven't seen the movie but nevertheless will insist on pronouncing on its (or rather lack of) worthiness. Some of them even pretended to have seen it, but the errors in their reviews showed that all they did was to read other similarly ignorant reviews. Some probably even pretended to be what they are not - a couple of gay cowboys turned up one immediately after another to trash the film (one of these self-described gay cowboy even derided it as gay propaganda with little coherent explanation why it is so), how likely is that? These reviews are often stupid and dishonest, they don't make the slightly sense to anyone who had actually seen and understood the film. Some of these people will say that the film is ""average"" or ""OK"", but then it give a 1 out of 10? Do they understand what ""average"" means? Brokeback Mountain is by no means the perfect film, there are parts which I find unsatisfactory, either I find these parts not well-acted (Cassie, for example, overacted with her huge drops of tears in her last scene when Heath Ledger gave a perfectly restrained performance in the same scene that still managed to show his anguish and desolation), or I thought perhaps could been done differently or better. However, it is not possible to give it a vote 9.5, so a 10 it will be, if only to do my little bit to counter those dishonest people who voted out of hatred and spite rather than having genuinely seen the film.",Brokeback Mountain

Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhal are both so handsome and good looking, both brilliant actors, performance - outstanding.This movie is like Romeo and Juliet of the homosexualism. A love so pure and true made impossible by the prejudice and narrow-mindedness of the people. The whole tragedy of the characters is that they are bound to live in times that are not mature enough to accept the different, and reject them in fear of the unknown.They both realize the time and space they live in, there is nothing pretentious or pompous about the way they behave, nothing fancy or phony, the only reason they follow is the love to each other and the only real time is the one spend together.

We had read that it was going to be sweet and tender and a depiction of forbidden love. To begin with I was dazzled by the beauty of the countryside that Ang Lee had chosen to set the movie in, and Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal looked very promising in their roles. They began their relationship it seemed to me as two friends who just got on well. But before you knew what had hit you they had had their ""meeting"" in the tent and were thrown in to this forbidden love that just seemed uncomfortable. It did pick up however when they both went their separate ways and began to get married and have kids etc. After that it began to be a relationship and not a fling, a part of themselves that they had to hide to prevent horrific things happening to them. The acting in this movie does have to be praised as the two protagonists broke barriers even of what two men acting in a movie can do, and it was convincing enough that by the end of the movie I found myself crying when Heath Ledger found the shirt that he had lost twenty years earlier kept by Jake Gyllenhaals character. Overall this film was impressive in set and acting but the way that love was handled to begin with ruined what I felt could have been a really tender relationship build up.",Brokeback Mountain
481,Viddy24,Slow...and disappointing.,4,7 March 2007,"I watched it, and honestly...I was expecting it to be really good. What I got was nothing more than a slow, and not very impressive film. Firstly, Heath Ledger was brilliant. He played his role nicely, and it was very realistic. That was probably the best part of the film, plus, a few other bits. Unfortunately, there were too many bad things about the film. 1) It was too slow!! 2) Jake didn't give an Oscar nominee/worthy performance, though it was good. 3) You could hardly hear what they were saying, and thats not a lie. So overall, the film was disappointing, I ended up turning it off near the end because...I just didn't really care. 4/10.",Brokeback Mountain

Over the course of several weeks, they develop a friendship which on a cold and drunken night becomes something more. At first they are wary of what they have done but realise that what they have shared which each other overrides any shame or anguish they may have about their taboo relationship. It soon develops into more than either two could have imagined but of course there are difficulties to overcome. Heath Ledger's character, Ennis Del Mar, is to be married in November and cannot commit to Jake Gyllenhaal's character, Jack Twist, who wants them not to hide what they have and move somewhere where they can make a living and continue their relationship unabated. However, Ennis cannot make this commitment and rejoins his fiancé and marries.The story picks up years later when Ennis has 2 children of his own and receives a postcard from Jack that he will be in town. When Jack turns up on the doorstep, none of the affection has diminished and they passionately embrace, a move which is not missed by Ennis's wife and the seeds of disaster are sown. Over the next lot of years they make trips away to ""fish"", and life continues as normal as far as Ennis's character can foresee. Due to their on/off relationship and intricate nature of their own desire for each other, Jacks character also marries after knocking up a girl he woo's at the rodeo and both women are obviously kept in the dark to their extra-marital affair.The film explores the deep seated bigoted machismo of the American mid-west and the necessity to hide their love even when they are not around their wives. However, it is more of a film where a secret love must be hidden from everyone even to the point of hiding their true feelings from each other. About how such a love can have disastrous impact on those around them when such a love is revealed and how love survives through even the most difficult times. If you thought Brokeback Mountain was just a gay cowboy movie then you are in for a revelation. If you thought Brokeback Mountain was just a love story then you're in for a surprise. The film is as groundbreaking as it is a treat to watch. Do yourself a favour and saddle up to an Oscar worthy movie full of twists, turns and outstanding performances.",Brokeback Mountain

We've all heard of the story of 2 cowboys who fall in love with another and form a homosexual relationship. But what this movie is an emotional telling of 2 people who could not conform or be accepted into society because of their love for another. The story is simple but powerful. It's filmed wonderfully by Ang Lee as he shows the landscapes similar to Terrance Malick in Badlands. The acting throughout is so spectacular too. It's such a pity we lost Heath Ledger, because this film shows how verso tale of an actor he was. Jake Gyllenhaal also churns out his best performance since Donnie Darko. The rest of the cast also contributes nicely, but its clear the focus of the movie. It's all on the should ours of the 2 leads in a quite difficult role to play. You feel emotionally connected to these characters by the end, and that's hard to do in a story like this. Give credit to Ang Lee for filming this movie with the right touches to avoid distaste.

I was so invested in the characters, Jake and Heath did amazing work here, their chemistry was of the charts, everything was brought to life in such a terrific way that I really felt as if I was in this world with them. As a member of the LGBT this story really hits home, this movie never through around gay stereotypes, just two men falling in love in a world that is so hateful, that you have a target over your head if anyone found out. ""Jack, I swear."" honesty brings me to tears thinking about it, something so simple but with so much meaning and symbolism.

Obviously they feel that this twist will either sell the movie, or maybe do not want some folks to be surprised by the plot? To be honest I was sitting there waiting for the relationship to start.This is a long, slow moving love story, and I loved how this story arced over many, many years. A friend mentioned to me that the relationship was not explicit enough, but for me the story was all about love and friendship. Their relationship, like all others, is full of questions, confusion, and doubt, expressed by Heath Ledger's understated, moving performance.Alberta province in Canada acts as the stand-in for Montana, and serves as a beautiful backdrop for an important aspect of the story. The outdoors is where they have sanctuary, and all their fond memories of that first summer back in '63.It was an honor to have Ang Lee show up and introduce the film. He said that after The Hulk he wasn't sure if he wanted to continue to be a filmmaker. This story, the screenplay and the shooting experience in Alberta has shown him to love making films again.See Brokeback Mountain for a well told and real love story.

They only had themselves. The complexity of their situations would be incomprehensible to people were it not for the fine film-making and acting. This movie really hurts. I am emotionally overwhelmed. But also we should be really proud that it came out of America. Gay people (like me, I admit) should be really happy that this big mainstream movie is so impressive and moving.

488,Redbreast777,Grossly over-rated ....,4,9 April 2006,"Grossly over-rated ... but PR is PR. Certainly the gay and artsy communities are happy to see the film made for the groundbreaking it does - but groundbreaking does not equal good film-making.The plot is relatively predictable - think back to Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn in ""Same Time, Next Year"". Two lovers meet on a regular basis for a number of years while living separate lives the rest of the time. Big deal, this time the two lovers are gay cowboys. Yes, it was a love story - but a poorly done love story that drags on and on and on - then abruptly falls off a cliff and ends too quickly.The acting starts off mediocre and doesn't get much better. Randy Quaid was OK in ""Category 6: Day of Destruction"" (TV) but hasn't had a really decent part since ""Hard Rain"". This was a big step backwards. Jake Gyllenhaal is weak (though the ladies seem to drool a lot when he is around) and heartthrob Heath Ledger plays below his capabilities. If you can ignore the less than stellar acting and look at the scenery, the location in the Canadian Rockies is absolutely spectacular and the cinematography is incredible. Also nice to see Linda Cardellini from ER with a minor part which she handled well - look forward to seeing more of her on the big screen. Look for good things in the future from Kate Mara.I can only suggest the movie's reception was largely a product of all the hype - but as they say in Texas, this one is all hat and no cattle!",Brokeback Mountain

It is true that the main characters in the movie are cowboys, and that they fall in love with each other, but that is not everything. This story could be of anyone. But it is of two men in love.Ennis del Mar (Heath Ledger) is a shy young guy who gets a job herding sheep for a summer in Brokeback Mountain, with Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) as a partner. One cold night they end up drunk and in a same tent, and make love. This is where the love story begins. After the summer both men go separate directions, get married and get children, but they never forget each other. Then one day after four years they meet again and there is no turning back.Brokeback Mountain is emotionally packed, powerful movie. It left me feeling blown up for a day at least. Only few movies do that to me, that they really get into my head and don't let go. Brokeback Mountain did that. It is not so much of the things that are said in the movie, that get you. It is the things that are left unsaid. And it is not only the things that are shown in the movie that get you. It is the things that are left unshown.It was interesting to notice how big erotic impact a movie like this can have. I have no desire to see real gay sex, but seeing these two strong men hugging each other, kissing each other after many years of separation, I was totally stunned.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are amazing in this movie. They are brave men who take this kind of role that has the possibility of making them immortal and take them to the top actors' league, but also possibility of marking them with the ""gay"" stamp forever. Both were just fantastic. Of the minor roles, Michelle Williams as Ennis' wife Alma actually shines in her role. When Alma witnesses his husband kissing a guy, she is heart broken, but keeps everything for herself.Ang Lee really knows how to make ""pretty pictures"" (for example Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). Every single frame of the movie was a work of art in itself. The stunning scenery, colours and the people, everything was just perfect.",Brokeback Mountain

It tells the story of 2 sheep herders who have an affair that spans over 20 years. They meet at the place they originally met, Brokeback Mountian, and have their dalliance every so often even though they both marry two attractive girls and settle down with children. The story is simple really, but Ang Lee directs with a softness and tenderness that is both poignant and sad. I felt sad for these two that don't seem to connect with anyone;including their wives. Heath Ledger is especially good as Innis. He's got the walk, talk and mannerisms that I would expect a cowboy to have. Jake Gyllenhall is good, too as Innis' ""friend"". The film is not boring or dull but a fascinating character study of lonely people in lonely places that few fear to tread. This was a close second to CRASH of the choices that we had.

491,agsconnolly,Unexpectedly important,8,13 February 2008,"I resisted watching this film for a long time. The media hype it received over what I perceived to be hackneyed subject matter was off-putting and the raving over two young actors acting out a forbidden love story was something I felt I could do without.I'm somewhat ashamed to say the death of Heath Ledger is what forced me to take the plunge. I had to see what all the fuss was about. Still, I approached it with trepidation, haunted by phrases such as ""the most important film for years"" which seem to be applied to anything that can be construed as left wing these days.Thie first 30 minutes or so left me uncomfortable. I guess, like many people, I was afraid of the graphic portrayal of the two men's relationship and didn't know how I would react to the first signs of it. And yes, I did find it tough to start with. But I soon realised that the reason for that was due to the characters I was watching, and the fact that neither knew how or why it was happening, and would never have considered this kind of union in their normal lives. Ledger's character, particularly, is a massively introverted and silent soul who cannot process the feelings that the relationship generates.The rest of the film is simply a study of isolation and deeply-stored feelings that are universally understandable. I had been concerned, prior to seeing the film, that its premise would be absurd and there would be an impossible depiction of two queens living it up in secret amongst dour cattlemen. But what the film portrays is far more real, a confused mesh of feelings and hopes, and the fierce and brutal opposition to it that lurks continuously.So having seen it, I can agree that this film is important. It's important because it doesn't particularly say one thing or another. It's not a wail against homophobia, it's not staunchly against the social politics of the American South, it's not a protest for freedom and understanding. It's just a story. And a brilliantly delivered one at that.RIP Heath Ledger.",Brokeback Mountain

And thats not a nice thing to be. So be it, it's a great story perfected by two fantastic actors that made us believe there love for each other.Ang Lee knew what he was doing when he decided to work on this film, he found the right cast and found the right environment for a great film and he knew that out of all his films this is the one that made it big, people noticed this film as his big one. Ang Lee has always made sure that all his films are different and this continues that saga of films.Heath Ledger, what do you say, what a brilliant actor, he fired himself up for such a role and probably got a lot of stick for it, when I saw him on my screen, I realised he was that cowboy, he was the one that fired up Jake Gylinhalls character, he is that big character that has too choose, he played the role so well, no one could have challenged his performance.Jake Gylinhall, was perfect, when they start there intercourse scene, Jake did it perfectly, calm and careful and then he pushed Heaths character to do it, he managed to find this difficult character and played it brilliantly, he knew what he had to do and he did it. Donnie Darko to Jarhead (bummer) then to this (fantastic) he has proved himself an actor.Overall I give this film a 9/10 because of Ang Lee's style to shooting and how shoots the film, Heath and Jake's wonderful performances, and also to the female characters who stay far away but play there roles brilliantly, and even Anna Faris being in it (scary Movie girl) she also performed her role brilliantly. And the accents are great.Great film, watch it if you know what you are about to see, if you don't watch it, we all know why, this film tells us about love in a different way, it deserves everything, I mean everything, it is one brilliant film that stuns you from start to finish, Ang Lee you are great!",Brokeback Mountain

From the deepest part of me this is a beautiful, beautiful masterpiece which has been wrenching at my gut for days. It has left me with the thoughts 'why didn't he say this? Why didn't this happen?..but ultimately the only consideration is: 'if only they could have been together, which is what both men wanted.' How deeply I felt for Jack who, despite all his efforts, cannot realise his simplest dreams. (not even in death when his old man refuses to send his ashes to Brokeback)It is criminal how humanity treats what is the most divine thing of all: love (no matter between which adults) and how it has been turned into something salacious by certain individuals. eg. the religious right in America who really glory in making everyone feel miserable sinners and who believe people have to live the way they have chosen to. Nor should they be allowed to dictate how this love should be depicted on screen -so 10 points to Ang Lee for his refreshing honesty.I also applaud a film which shows real men, as it happens in real life and not stereotypically versions of camp gays. It might be uncomfortable for the straight men among us, but why should it be? These are serious flaws in society that need to be examined once and for all. I find it all the more difficult to understand those that have given one star - we're all different, I know, and sometimes a film speaks to you and sometimes it doesn't but in this case I can only assume they have closed their hearts they have been indoctrinated by the MTV 10 sec pop-blurb sort of film where you need the concentration span of a fly. (What is revealing is the anger they have inside)I have spoken to nearly all my male friends, straight and gay, and all have said they have experienced a love and longing for, maybe, their best mate, that they might never have expressed or else a deep regret that it was never taken further. In the film we are talking soul-love here, spiritual love which, when it cannot be denied, will spill over into true physical expression. This impression is shown admirably in the strength of two wonderful performances of the actors Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. One, more accepting and braver to ignore what others might think to experience the only happiness he has with Ennis, the other deeply hurt as a young man and thrashing about internally trying to come to terms with the desire to just follow Jack on his path but not allowing himself to (his inner mind's thoughts and criticisms that really belong to others weighing him down) He knows he is happy with Jack, he knows that he would want to be with Jack because love is an energy and transcends the two protagonists; it's a soul mate thing. Not for one moment did I think about the sexuality of these actors or of the characters they portrayed, I just saw two men's love for one another. And what is the utter beauty of the film is a complex story told so simply in the most natural of surroundings. It convinces, it causes you to feel your own emotions and ultimately this film works so perfectly; it is so heart-rending because I, myself, have been there.",Brokeback Mountain

It's about unfulfilled dreams and the missed chances for happiness. It is something every human being can relate to. I think the performances are outstanding and the movie treats the subject matter with a seriousness that prevents it from ever becoming maudlin or even simplistic.Heath Ledger is superb as the tormented cowboy trying desperately to conform.

You can polish off the Proulx short story, write an essay about it and still have time to clean your house in the time Ang Lee takes to bring this one into harbour. It even manages to lumber on for half an hour after the major plot issue is resolved, but the story offers so little hope from the beginning that you've not exactly been on tenterhooks waiting for Ennis and Jack to elope to San Francisco.They do age well though, probably better than I did during this epic. Ledger becomes a stockier Robert Redford, Gyllenhall into a more muscular John Waters. Sadly we'll never know how one of those guesses worked out in real life. Gyllenhaal is his usual revelatory self, every tic and muscle emanating conflict desire and emotion. Ledger, as the less self-aware character, has less to work with and plays every scene as though he had a sock stuffed in his mouth.But it's still way too long: Proulx manages to cram a novel's worth of insights and epiphanies into 10,000 carefully chosen words.

Not only was it genuinely good, it was actually remarkably sophisticated for a mainstream movie. In many ways, it reminded me of a Herzog film: nothing felt rushed, a lot relied on innuendo (in a good way) to convey inner thoughts and emotions, and there was some beautiful cinematography. Mostly I had heard that it was sad and, yes, that was true at times, but there was also some humour and, IMHO, some profound metaphor. I guess the fact that it's a hit is a good sign: audiences may be becoming more sophisticated (which, hopefully, will result in the film industry responding, specifically in the arena of bigger-budgeted films).

Same thing here - no Brokeback Mountain, no Jack and Ennis. The mountain itself is free and unbounded - just like the two men probably wish they were. Alas, there's always society to deal with. Heath Ledger (Ennis) is wonderful in this -- taciturn and unable to articulate any of his feelings.

Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar are hired to herd sheep on Brokeback Mountain. They get to know each other in the middle of nowhere and their friendship soon blossoms into feelings they cannot deny. When they part ways due to the ending season, what seemed to be a summer fling actually turns out to be a lifelong passionate love story. Brokeback Mountain tells Ennis and Jack's secret relationship over almost 2 decades. This masterpiece is a love manifesto avoiding clichés. Its focus is the struggle to live with yourself when society doesn't accept who you are and dictates who you should or shouldn't love. The fight against self-hatred and prejudice are also central topics of the storyline. Ang Lee majestically directs one of the most beautiful love stories ever told on the silver screen. He succeeds where others have failed: he delivers a dynamic movie out of a plot that could have been slow. Lee certainly is an actor's director. The cast he's chosen to prove this point radiates with truth. The late Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal in the leading roles praise tolerance with their magnificent interpretation. You can also enjoy the performance of a plethora of good supporting actors: Michelle Williams, Kate Mara, Anne Hathaway, Anna Faris... The fabulous country original score is soothing and echoes in the splendid hills of Wyoming. The sound of the resonator guitar transports you to those quiet great outdoors. I can only hope the blatant moral of this picture will stick to your shoes forever. Brokeback Mountain highlights the cruelty of mankind towards difference. There is a paradoxical challenge enlightened by this tale: whether you embrace or hide who you are, you will have to pay the price. Let's hope Brokeback Mountain, a figurative mountain of New Queer Cinema, helps people not to ever have to pay the price again.1 reason to watch: BM will be a wakening whether or not it's about your own situation.

Ennis is a boy of so few words he can barely open his mouth to release them; he learned to be guarded and fearful long before he knew what he feared. Jack, who has done some rodeo riding, is a little more outgoing, and likes to have fun. After some days have passed on the mountain and some whiskey has been drunk, they suddenly and almost violently have sex. After the day fades away Ennis tells Jack ""This is a one-shot thing we got going on here,""Ennis says the next day. Jack agrees. But it's far from that. After summer, they part. A while after their boss Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) tells Jack he doesn't want him to return next summer. Many years pass and Jack and Ennis get married to different people, not seeing each other a while after Jack sends a postcard to Ennis saying he'll be in town (Wyoming). They begin a routine were they pretend to go fishing on mountainside and secretly they act out their secret passion. One day, Ennis's wife Alma (Michaelle Williams), suspects there is more than a friendship between the two. After they both learn that they have an intimate relasionship, which is ruined after a tragedy that will engulf their long, secret relasionship.The movie is based on a short story by E. Annie Proulx. I'm not familirar with it, but since this film was so acclaimed, I though I should just see it, and I did. I didn't particularly enjoy it all over, it was an average film. The performances where outstanding, but I really failed to see what everyone else saw in this film. The scenery is outstanding, along with the performances, that's another good thing, in the world beyond Jack and Ennis' relationship, love and tenderness are rarely found. That's a flaw in this finely crafted film, though it does serve to emphasize the unparalleled importance Jack and Ennis' relationship has in their lives. My only advice is to watch some of Ang Lee's better films, such as The Ice Storm. Now, that is far superior work. To me Brokeback did not live up to the immense hype. Sorry, but I just did not like it that much.6/10",Brokeback Mountain
506,almagz,The Malborough Man can be gay,4,27 April 2006,"Mediocre westerns have been filmed on grandiose backgrounds where majestic mountains and great divides have somewhat compensated for fifteen minute plots where a group of unwashed ragtags eating beans take up an expendable hour getting from point A to point B. To some extent this movie shares that unremarkable distinction.If the intention of this movie is to present the male homosexual experience in a memorable, unforgettable, landmark way, it fails terribly. Two rednecks with the vision, ambition, and sophistication of one of the Clampetts are brought together carnally as they herd (watch? protect?) sheep in very cold weather. It is the way in which they first get it on that in my opinion dooms this movie to the level of mere fashionable shock. They get it on pure and simple and with the skilled directness of professional porno actors. There is little if any pretense at affection, seduction, exploration, discovery, etc. and the application of spit so artful! I could not help thinking that if it had involved the sheep instead, it might have been done more gracefully.They drink a lot, swear a lot, complain that sheep-herding and cow-punching is no way to get rich, and apparently get it on a lot since they are rarely near the sheep and their job performance is a bit questionable. The rodeo bit is brought in eventually as another indication (I guess) of men being macho, financial failures, and gay. The author apparently wanted to convey a story of true love being trapped and doomed by circumstances leading to an unhappy ending. Well, Romeo and Juliet this is not. As they lead their separate lives, our two main characters meet to get it on at varying intervals and their get-away love nest gives title to the movie. The continuous frustration expressed in their inability to conveniently become life partners is not enough to earn them much sympathy with this viewer. The limited diet of their wilderness tryst is a subject at times, but they never bother to fish. Is it that they don't like fish? They ride horses, enjoy the beautiful scenery, discuss how unfair the world is to them, and apparently get it on so much, they don't have time to fish. Thing is, it is the limited scope of their world that is limiting their opportunity. If they truly love each other, why not get away somewhere else-say San Francisco? Is it because there are no sheep or cattle to herd there? Or that there is no need for heavy construction equipment there? It seems that they are more afraid of leaving their redneck environment, then they are of being miserable and horny most of the time.In the final analysis the movie would have been better titled Redneck Mountain, and the acclaim it may have received is probably in no small way due to the present ""correctness"" trend in artistic circles. I can't say I was qualified, or interested in judging the actual acting. For one thing it would make a difference knowing whether the protagonists are actually gay or not. Except to those that choose to make this movie a flagship for their cause, I am afraid that the acting performance is doomed to be forgotten.A tawdry, sad, exploitative movie.I retrospect I can see that this review will succeed in pleasing almost no one. The true homophobes will feel I am too kind giving it four stars (three are for cinematography) and those desperate or fashionable enough to feel obligated to taking this movie to their heart will think me insensitive, a closet gay-basher or whatever.Fact is I have no desire to pass judgment or express an opinion on any aspect of the entire alternate sex issue. I am limiting myself to the story and the character development as a worthy movie. Now, the majority of gay people are going to feel committed to seeing this movie for obvious reasons. Certain straights are going to see the movie and force themselves to like it in a patronizing sort of way. I fall in neither of these categories, so I am going to call things as I see them, plain and simple. The relationship between the two men is never developed past the purely physical. Other than small talk and what they have been doing for a living, one has little idea at what they have to talk about. They are both cheating on their wives and the beautiful mountain location is not the inn of the seventh happiness but merely a far away place to hide their unpopular activities. The way the children and wives are handled by them is selfish and insensitive. So they are afraid to come out, but other than for the fact that it is inconvenient and possibly dangerous in their circumstances, little else is developed on the subject. Now it isn't as if they have serious careers or other critical factors keeping them from moving elsewhere. Their wives indubitably would be better off without them. So they make (or fail to make) their choices and if I were gay, I would be far from pleased with this movie. On the other hand, if you've decided you're going to like this movie, by all means go see it.",Brokeback Mountain
507,martin_g_karlsson,The Gay Cowboy Rides Again,8,17 April 2006,"Its the old familiar story of two cowboys developing a love for each other and the obstacles that a very conservative society puts up in order to prevent it. The challenge they face is much greater than that of an average rodeo ride as there are forces involved bound to throw you out the saddle a lot harder than any horse ever would.The story is actually quite simple, but still very gripping. The two main characters work hard to hide their love, they take on new families and deny themselves continually and systematically, just to create the front required. The film never gets cheesy or syrupy, the way that I perhaps thought it would for some reason. Rather its all about a long struggle to achieve ""normality"" and to at least just sometimes get to bust that nut up in your lovers butt. The sex in the film is not particularly graphic though, there is only one real sex scene, and its short. Rather you sit and want for them to at least blow each other a bit.Its a pretty classy movie, which might indeed become a classic. Wonderful photography. Great acting. And a believable sad and sometimes bitter sweet storyline with an important message. People should be free to love each other the way that they want.

508,TheFabulousThomasJ,A Film Classic That Will Be Remembered 50 Years From Now,10,11 March 2010,"My friends and I have a theory: those who bad-mouth Brokeback Mountain have NOT seen it.This is a beautifully filmed motion picture; I'd dare as line it up alongside the David Lean 1962 classic ""Lawrence of Arabia"" and John Ford's 1956 masterpiece ""The Searchers"" for landscape and scenery being a principal character.And heartbreaking, too; my, my! Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal play two young buck cowboys with nary a pot to pee in nor a window to throw it out of, herding sheep by their lonesome in Wyoming during the summer of 1963.And because they have nothing but themselves, they first fall into rutting lust, and then slowly into love.What is even more heart-breaking is the fact that they have the opportunity to strike out on their own as cowboy ranchers, but fear keeps one of the duo from following through.And in the course of twenty years of meeting for summertime fishing trips, they fritter their lives away.I watched this in a full house of blue collar types when it arrived here in our town; after the film was over, the general consensus was Brokeback Mountain was awesome, and we were glad for the chance to see this (finally) on the big screen, after all the hoopla controversy surrounding it.Definitely one to own on DVD.",Brokeback Mountain
509,b-gaist,Well-Crafted Gay Propaganda Movie,5,12 April 2006,"""Brokeback Mountain"" is not just the title, but also a character in the movie. The beautiful and lavish shots of nature, trees, animals, water, sky, snow - all these are skilfully employed in the attempt to convey to viewers a sense, that what takes place between the male characters is ""natural"". The tag-line (""Love is a Force of Nature"") underscores the director's intention to persuade us that, not only is gay sex ""natural"", it is also beautiful and loving. In doing this, Ang Lee is almost successful, and will no doubt preach his message mostly with the results he desires, convincing both the already converted and many among the undecided. The dark shadow of gay sexuality barely shows through this film, in a single, rather ritualistic encounter between Jack Twist and a male prostitute in Mexico, and also in the amusing scene where Jack and his wife Lureen meet another Midwestern couple, and the ""husband"" arranges a sexual meeting with Jack on the pretext of going fishing (again - how many women are going to wonder about their husband's fishing expeditions after watching this film?!). Joking aside, the film does do a good job of portraying the deceit which accompanies such empty and unhappy marriages; what it fails to do, however, is to explore the motivations and psychology of the characters in real depth. Jack and Ennis come across as two rather flat and ill-defined personalities who are little more than the director's mouthpieces. They are both sympathetic in many ways, but something's missing. What have they really found in each other? Why is their bond so strong? Ang Lee has directed a film which reinforces current stereotype notions of depathologised homosexuality. If this was a movie about a man and a woman with the same plot and setting, would it get so many awards?",Brokeback Mountain
510,Deoglood,"Despite hype, portrayal is authentic!",9,18 November 2006,"I've read many of the reviews, and I'm real puzzled by the audience's blindness to the passion between the two cowboys. Can anybody give an example of better acting of passion? Given that cowboys are a special breed, and that the movie not only displays two men loving each other, but that two men in this very specific circumstance and faced with this very real challenge, I just don't know what someone could expect.The so-called 'family values' crowd can complain about how a movie would 'celibrate' infidelity and a lifestyle that is 'ruinous', but they are missing the point. It's that kind of thinking that the two cowboys have caved to and tried to be what they knew, against their nature. At no point was this glossed over or amplified, it was and is real for today's and yesterday's rural men and women.Yet the liberals complain that the movie was poop because the story would be stupid if the characters had been heterosexual. This would be true, because in the social context, two straight people falling in love and cheating is pretty common, and usually petty in nature. If you cannot distinguish the different social forces that make this story significant, then by all means, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! Go to church and pray for your sins.For those of you who claim there is no passion between these two men, you know nothing about cowboys or rural men. Step out of the metro-sexual mindset, this ain't the Gillmore Girls.I've been fortunate, having experienced love like this. It's painful, it's frustrating, and sometimes it's worth every second of it. What those actors did was nothing short of accurate and they honored what this movie was about.This movie was Shakespearean, and the acting was excellent. There were some things I didn't like, but they were stylistic and not even worth complaining about.",Brokeback Mountain
511,Louisville88,"A wonderful, touching film that is realistic",10,7 January 2006,"This is just one of the few movies I've seen that seemed real. These characters were just so wonderful. Jake Gyllenhaal was fantastic! I cried in the scene in which Ennis turns him down and I'm a straight male! Heath Ledger was also wonderful. You really saw his struggle between right and wrong. Michelle Williams was also phenomenal! I've never even heard of her until this and I hope she wins that Golden Globe and Oscar. I also cried when she found out about Ennis secret love. The only thing that really made me upset was when Jack (Jake) had sex with a Mexican whore and got some ugly rancher toward's the end. I thought, ""They ruined the story. How is it suppose to be a story about forbidden love, when one of them is cheating?"" Then I reread the book, and discovered that that really happened. Then I analyzed it as, ""Well, he had the love and affection (From Ennis) but he just needed the Romance. He was the more gay of the couple and he needed to fill loved. Sleeping with a Mexican whore and some ugly rancher was really his only way of being with Ennis."" Anne Hathaway was also good, though I have to say I was more shocked on seeing her bear her womanhood than Jake and Heath kiss. That brings me to my next point. Ang Lee made me, and my girlfriend, feel as if what Jack and Ennis were doing was as normal as could be. My girlfriend and myself weren't uncomfortable in the least. We just got uncomfortable seeing our little princess bear her womanhood. But it was still okay, really didn't my mind away from the film. I also got disappointed when they played one of my favorite songs from the film, ""I don't want to say goodbye"" in the scene with Jack and the ugly rancher. Really Jack was dancing with the ugly rancher's wife, but still. This is a terrific movie that deserves Best Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress, Song, Screenplay and score. Also, they did a wonderful job with aging everybody. They even gave Anne nicotine stains in-between her teeth! A must see for anyone with an open mind and a heart.",Brokeback Mountain
512,CC4ever,Brokeback Mountain,7,11 June 2020,"I wanted to watch this movie very early, but I still watch it now. Moved? I didn't feel it.Respect the choices of others, never underestimate the love between same sex, and even feel that they are brave and pitiful: after all, in the eyes of most people in the world, this is not accepted or even shameful. But what is wrong with them, love and not love, born with it.Faced with secular pressure, form marriage: This should be the most perfect solution. The two are good friends and live a life of convention. Cheating marriage: Marrying another woman with your heart on your back, the woman's face is stunned: Why doesn't my husband have sex with me, how can sex be so difficult? Is it because I have a problem, I am not beautiful enough and not good enough? Self-doubt is deepening and he is loving. Unmarried: Bachelor, I just don't get married, and I don't want to talk about how to force myself. In short, I don't get married. Open love: Be brave and be yourself. I even bless them in my heart, they are particularly brave. After all, the pressure is all there!Here I just want to talk about cheating. You can make love with others during the relationship between husband and wife. What do you think about your wife in this name?Can you accept that your wife was cheating during the relationship?If you can't accept it, why not tell her and then say: Let's divorce.Or tell her that I like others and respect your choice.What makes her self-deprecating and self-deprecating in a painful life, and tells her spiritedly: You are wrong.What is wrong with them.When you step out of your own denial and dare to admit to yourself, then you are the brave one and will also drive the bravery of another person.

514,robertrosado,The best film of 2005.,10,8 June 2006,"I first saw ""Brokeback Mountain"" when it first opened in theaters, late last year. I left the cinema shaken, and not exactly sure what to say. As I lay awake that night, my mind remained stuck on this film. No matter how hard I tried, I could not shake this tragic and powerful tale. I began to wonder: What happens to these characters after the credits begin to roll? When a movie buries itself so thoroughly into your subconscious, you know that it is something special. In the summer of 1963, young ranch hands Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) are signed on to work together on a Wyoming mountain range. At first, their relationship is strained, with Jack having to coax the shy Ennis into speaking. Soon, their bond deepens into something that neither of them expected: they fall in love. Once the summer ends, Ennis marries his fiancée, Alma Beers (Michelle Williams), and Jack weds spoiled rodeo queen Lureen. Through the eventual unhappiness and heartbreak that follows, the two risk their careers and lives by trying, once and for all, to follow their hearts in a time of discrimination.Plain and simple: This film is a masterpiece, as only a sturdy and brave filmmaker like Ang Lee could deliver. He's in control at every turn. The pacing, the silences, the tears... Not since ""Ordinary People"" have I seen a movie that so truthfully and beautifully embraces the human spirit. These are not characters, these are real people. Real enough to make legions to moviegoers around the world care, listen, and feel.The performances are uniformly strong. Michelle Williams's startlingly moving work may be just what she needed to have a long and healthy career. She is brilliant as Alma, Ennis's unhappy wife. The expression on Williams's face when Alma discovers Jack and Ennis kissing is chilling in its accuracy. Williams builds the character's growing angst, cumulating in an outburst that feels organic. I don't know how Williams prepared for this scene, but it has to be seen to be believed. Anne Hathaway also shines as Lureen, Jack's trophy wife. As we see Lureen's gradual descent into animosity, Hathaway's performance reaches its peak during a phone conversation between Lureen and Ennis. She's excellent.The rest of the cast is great, too. In a textbook example of ensemble acting, there are no slouchers here. Randy Quaid is stern and cold as Jack and Ennis's boss. The luminous Linda Cardellini, with approximately 15 to 20 lines, creates a believable human being in Cassie. Kate Mara is astonishing as Ennis's loyal daughter, leaving a lasting impression with only a handful of scenes. Anna Faris is refreshing and hilarious as LaShawn, Lureen's talkative friend. Finally, Canadian actress Roberta Maxwell makes a brief yet unforgettable appearance as Jack's mother. In a later scene with Ennis, she puts her hand on his shoulder, and whispers something to him. What she says, and how she says it, will send shivers down your spine.However, the film belongs to Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Jake Gyllenhaal is spirited and earnest as Jack, playing him as a caring soul. Jack wants nothing more than to be with Ennis, knowing full well that it's impossible. It is when Jack becomes bitter and angry that Gyllenhaal's portrayal hits its stride. At the risk of sounding like a cliché, Ledger's Ennis del Mar is the soul of this picture, and he could not be more stunning. Who would have expected Ledger - whose credits include ""10 Things I Hate About You"", ""A Knight's Tale"", and the acclaimed ""Monster's Ball"" - to deliver a performance of such depth and frightening understanding? Ennis is a man who lies to himself for so long, only to realize that he has wasted his life, and possibly ruined the life of those he loves. Ledger makes this internal variance feel palpable and transcendent, using masterful choices in voice and body language to create a man who is conflicted with himself. This is a focused and thrilling performance that will go down in history.Technically, the film is flawless. The costumes are well-suited to the characters, and are carefully aged with the story, as well as the make-up and hair. The cinematography, by Rodrigo Prieto, flawlessly captures the breathtaking landscapes, as well as the nuances of the story. The sparse score by Gustavo Santaolalla is haunting in its simplicity. The editing, by Geraldine Peroni and Dylan Tichenor, is smooth and the pace is neither rushed nor sluggish.As great as the production values are, none of it would matter if it were not for Ang Lee. Lee wisely starts the movie on an awkward note, illuminating Jack and Ennis's uncomfortable connection with one another. Once the plot finds its direction, the story moves swiftly through the decades, without ever feeling either static or intermittent. Lee finds the genuineness and clarity in the story, and gets miraculous results from his cast and production team. The themes that the film sets itself upon are tricky. One wrong look, one wrong note, and the whole thing could collapse under its own weight. Lee does not let this happen. It is also to his credit that the love scenes between the two men are as tasteful and romantic as they deserve to be.As the film draws to a close, the final scenes are played with a perfect, bittersweet note that subtly hints at what could have been, and what may be. And it all occurs without ever coming off as histrionic. Every once in a while, a movie is released that, for all intents and purposes, is flawless. A movie that is poetic, profound, skillfully made, and deeply felt. A movie that so diligently shakes the viewer to their very core, that is seems all but destined to become a classic. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is one of those movies. It's the best film of 2005, and it should not be forgotten.",Brokeback Mountain
515,abelardo64,The Look Of Love,10,20 September 2005,"I don't remember when was the last time I felt a movie like I felt Ang Lee's extraordinary ""Brokeback Mountain"". I can safely say it's the greatest, original American melodrama since the times of Douglas Sirk and I'm sure that even the great Todd Haynes would agree with me. His stunning ""Far From Heaven"" is an exquisite reproduction, this one updates and reinvents it without betraying it. My girlfriend had tears in her eyes and so did I. Heath Ledger's character spoke to me directly. And the word sex hasn't come into the equation yet. Love takes over the whole story and Heath Leger will be the dominating star of the next decade, if he wants to. Jake Gylenhaal is also superb but his character, nags,understandably so, but we know Heath much better than him and we're on Heath side. The buttoning of the shirt is already a landmark scene in my mind. I'm sure this film is arriving at just the right time. It will teach without preaching and many will learn.",Brokeback Mountain
516,nick rostov,Why can't I stop reliving this movie?,10,17 December 2005,"It's been three days now and this Brokeback Brain-flu shows no sign of letting up. I've tried watching other movies, going out with friends, reading, working, but nothing works: not unlike Jack and Ennis, I'm stuck on Brokeback Mountain. Why am I awash in an aching flood of longing? That wasn't my life at all up there on that screen--I haven't lived a life of regret and lost chances. When I was twenty, thirty two years ago, I spent a magic summer with a girl I fell in love with the second I saw her--and we've been together ever since. We're surrounded by our almost grown children, we have careers we love, we're still discovering things about each other and forging all kinds of new paths in our lives. So why the aching and the longing and the sweet-sad regret that took hold of me the second I heard the first strains of Santaolalla's awesome score and haven't yet let go? Is it that the themes of pain so powerfully explored in this great work of art go deeper than the satisfactions and achievements of any one life? Is it that the movie says something eternally true about how alone we remain no matter what arms may hold us? Looking back, the last time I walked around in a movie for days and days after seeing it was The Last Picture Show, over thirty years ago. . So maybe it's about the magic combination of Larry McMurtry and Randy Quaid. Whatever it is, this movie is now up there with The Godfather, Citizen Kane, Wild Strawberries, The Last Picture Show, etc. I was beginning to think I'd never again see a movie that I would consider calling the best movie I ever saw in my life.

519,FilmWeekUK,A movie that's hard to forget,9,8 January 2006,"My initial thoughts on leaving the cinema were of slight disappointment given all the ""hype"". Despite attending a ""preview"" screening before the new year (in the UK where the movie has only just been released) the screen quality was poor (dusty and out of focus). I'd also expected more ""chemistry"" between the two leads but with the benefit of hindsight I guess I was just expecting more overt ""gay""ness, which really isn't what this movie is about. In the two weeks since I saw it, the subtleties of it keep coming back to haunt me and the little touches that are all the way through it suddenly come back to me. I've come to realise that the chemistry between the two leads is there and true to the characters. The movie is over two hours long and as someone who is still complaining about the three hours of my life wasted watching King Kong that I'll never get back (there was a really good 90 minute movie in there somewhere that got lost in poor dialogue and over-indulgence and some pretty ropey effects work) that isn't something I'd regard as a good thing normally. 90-100 minutes is as longs as should be needed to tell a story. But this movie is different. It takes its time, particularly in the first hour, but that's what makes it so powerful in the second half. It leaves you wanting more, looking at your watch wondering where the time went. The acting is superb from ALL those involved, minor and major characters, but if I had to single out any actor I'd agree with those who think this is a ""career best"" performance for Ledger as Ennis. He is outstanding, and bear in mind this is a comment coming from someone who'd dismissed the actor because of what appeared to be rather homophobic remarks he'd made about not being gay himself. If this movie doesn't win a whole bunch of Oscars for direction, for acting, for the score, for the cinematorgraphy.... there's no justice in the world.Bottom line: It's not a ""feel good"" movie but it's one that you won't forget. Go and see it! NB: Unlike the other ecstatic reviewers I've given it a 9 rather than a 10 (10 means it just couldn't have been any better, but I thought the ageing of the characters wasn't very convincing which marked it down). Don't let that lack of a 10 put you off. I generally wait for a movie on DVD but I went to the cinema to see this and despite the poor viewing experience because of the poor cinema facilities I will probably go and see it again before the DVD comes out (but at a different cinema).

And yet I write one more, because this movie moved me and means a lot to me as a gay man and a human being. I don't think this movie would have worked without the transcendent power of Heath Ledger's portrayal. When Ennis Del Mar ends his life ruined by his internalized homophobia, the pain he makes us see brings us all immediately to his experience. This is what can happen to you if society and your relationship to it conspire to keep you from attaining something so important to the human condition as love.This is a big Hollywood Epic, but masterpieces are not the exclusive terrain of quirky, off-beat films.

It was called Same Time, Next Year and was, I think, adapted from a stage play. In any case, it covered much of the same ground, i.e. two lovers take the occasional break together while carrying on a family life with someone else.

Just like that Harry Hamlin turkey, it may be an important historical landmark but it's really not much of a film. It's not even especially daring, going out of its way not to offend the prejudices of the potential straight ticketbuyers. There's definitely nothing to frighten the horses here.What you get is a rather laboured and overlong Hallmark TV movie instead. Tasteful, distant and lacking in passion but professionally made, it's hard to see what all the fuss is about from a European view. I suspect that people in the USA are embracing it like a banner without noticing the shonky stitching, using its box-office success to affirm their identity in a time when their government holds them in contempt. If so, any film would have done just as well, even Oliver Stone's much more daring Alexander, which did a lot more to break gay stereotypes than this does.The way that any criticism of the film is met with cries of homophobia is worryingly symptomatic of a wider insecurity that has nothing to do with the film's strengths or weaknesses. And there are a LOT of weaknesses here. Some bad performances from Heath mumblemumblemumble Ledger and Randy show-me-the-money Quaid, a hopeless copycat score, direction that plays more like disinterest than sensitivity and a script that goes on hitting the same two points over the head forever chief offenders. Worse is some of the dialogue, that sounds like it was lifted straight from a Jeff Stryker prison porno. I almost expected to hear the immortal ""I'm not gay"" ""You are now"" exchange that's such a mainstay of gay porn!!! Not a turkey, but more TVM than Trojan Horse. Come back, Andy Warhol, all is forgiven.",Brokeback Mountain
525,rsampron,Cliché Love Story Left Me Bored,3,16 February 2006,"Academy Award voters will likely give ""Brokeback Mountain"" the Oscar for Best Picture.The decision will be political rather than artistic, because it is a story about gay lovers. And that's a pity. Film is an artistic medium, first and foremost. If a film is didactic and awards are to be given, then they should be given for how artistically well the message was delivered and not for the message itself.Don't get me wrong. I'm a pro gay-rights liberal. I believe two people who love each other should be allowed under the law to marry, regardless of their sex. I have gay and trans-gender friends and acquaintances. If two people can love each other enough to want to make that commitment, my blessings are with them.Perhaps because I'm not at all ""shocked"" by the gay relationship, I approached this film strictly as a story of star-crossed lovers. On that level it is uninspiring and pedestrian. Worse, it is cliché. And that is unforgivable given the film's intent.When dealing with the story motif of ""star-crossed lovers"", there are usually two sets of conflicts: internal and external. The internal conflicts take place within and between the lovers in their souls and within their immediate, intimate relationship. The external conflicts are between those inside the intimate relationship and those outside it who want it stopped and, sometimes even worse, want the lovers punished because of it.The external conflicts are kept to a minimum, here, and dispatched quickly. They may account for 10 percent of the film. That being the case, this is a film that focuses on the internal conflicts. Because film is a visual medium, this can be a problem because internal conflicts of the soul are not terribly visual. They tend to work better in literature because we can read the characters' thoughts. As a result, directors tend to rely on external symbols as metaphors for the internal conflicts. That is fine with me, except this is how Ang Lee's work descends to cliché.The various clichés include: the men as shepherds (perhaps a connection to Matthew Shepard, the poor young man killed in Wyoming for being gay); sudden changes in weather, including flash snow storms and thunder; gentle sheep contrasted with a craggy, jagged landscapes; an unsettled feeling that the tent is not set-up right; unending meals of beans (lack of variety); the threat of wolves; following the first gay sex, a sheep is killed by a wolf followed by the wolf's inferred death, his tale hanging from a pole; the shepherd man on horseback rides into a stream clearing, startling a huge bear who roars at him furiously, frightening off the shepherd and his pack mules. These are as cliché as symbols can get.CAUTION! A SPOILER IS COMING. DON'T READ FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT THE PLOT LINE TO BE SPOILED! There is only one really good symbol, and it is actually for the external conflicts. One of the men dies under questionable circumstanceshe was changing a tire when it blew out and the rim hit him in the forehead and killed him, though the lover suspects he was killed ala Matthew Shepard (and another Wyoming connection, BTW). Half of his cremated remains are spread in Texas and the other half is sent to his parents in Wyoming with instructions that they be spread on Brokeback Mountain. The father will not allow it. These will be interred in the family plot. The truth of the relationship will be buried within the family and schism between two worlds, Texas and Wyoming, gay and straight, will stand even in death. It's a very good bit of symbolism.So when the visual metaphors of a story of internal conflict prove cliché and, therefore, fail to drive the emotions of the piece, we must rely on dialog to do the job.Unfortunately, we are left to suffer Marry McMurtry's (Lonesome Dove) suffocating staccato style. One man's a talker. The other is Gary Cooper in ""The Westerner"". He doesn't talk much, though he does kick stuff once in a while. Yup! For me the story fails because it doesn't inspire the kind of emotional connections one should feel from a story of star-crossed lovers. The best example of this kind of film for me is Zeffirelli's ""Romeo and Juliet"". Obviously you can't beat Shakespeare for the dialog. But the visuals that are married to this dialog allow the film to soar, fully supporting the word paintings with images worthy of the words.About the acting, I don't understand how come guys from Wyoming sound like they're from Oklahoma. I live in Colorado. I've been to Wyoming. People don't talk that way. In Southern and Western Wyoming, they speak with a flat, mid-western accent. In the Northeastern part of the state, they sound like they're from the Dakotas (think the movie ""Fargo"", but not quite as extreme). This interpretation is a real a problem because, even here, we are dealing with cliché. Why? Judging this film solely as an artistic love story, ""Brokeback Mountain"" failed for me. I was bored. If I was watching on HBO, I'd have been searching for the remote about halfway through. If it was not for the shock value of the gay relationship, this film would be forgotten as quickly as ""The Squid and the Whale"", another poorly rendered love story.This film will win Best Picture. It shouldn't. Of the three Best Picture nominees I've seen so far, ""Capote"" should.",Brokeback Mountain
526,stereoplaysjunk,"The Real ""Love Story""...",10,12 January 2006,"If you're going to put two attractive male actors on a beautiful backdrop of mountain scenery and tell them to get it on, it's always going to be a winner - this was at least my opinion on 'Brokeback Mountain' before I watched it the other night. And I was right - as I suspected.All too often does Hollywood present a 'more than perfect' insight into relationships, painting over the ugly parts and restricting any audience empathy. This film breaks all the rules but along the way redefines them with such grace that should be credited and admired.'Brokeback Mountain' tells the often heartbreaking, continuously touching story of two seemingly reserved Southern American guys who find love in the stunning Brokeback Mountain of Wyoming.The many people who have referred to this as 'The Gay Cowboy Movie' could not be more wrong. Brokeback serves as so much more than that and offers an insight into the perils of homosexual relationships in the mid sixties where when you were 'gay' you were happy.This film offers few rays of happiness however for the two lead characters Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) as they battle with their feelings for each other over the course of a twenty year affair.Ennis and Jack meet whilst herding sheep up on Brokeback and one drunken - and freezing cold night, Ennis is forced to take shelter in the tent with Jack.The highly talked about 'gay love' scenes are not nearly as scandalous as people (mainly strongly-heterosexual males) make out and Ang Lee presents pure lust, aggression and passion in just a few short seconds of footage.Gyllenhaal and Ledger star perfectly alongside each other in what might just be their 'career defining moment' and I truly doubt they will walk away from the major awards shows this year empty-handed. Both characters deliver some great lines, which will be quoted for a long time and a special mention should go out to the tear-jerking speech Jack gives on realising that love isn't as perfect - or as easy as the fairy tales tell you.The perfect script serves the film brilliantly and it is obvious that much love and time has gone into making it into a touching and sensitively shattering piece of writing.Perhaps I'm too sentimental, or perhaps Lee really does work that hard at pulling on the heartstrings of the audience, and what comes of it is pure, unadulterated emotion.Brokeback Mountain was always destined for success. When you have two such complex and superbly in-depth characterisations from the leading men and a very strong supporting cast it's always going to do well. The amazing direction from Lee and a more than perfect script all contribute to what I hope is going to be the film to sweep up at the Oscars.Never before have I been so moved by a film, and never before has a piece of cinema lingered on my mind for so long. It's true to admit that every once in a while a movie can come along and, believe me - it will change your perceptions on a lot of issues.My final tip? Take your tissues, 'cause you're sure as hell are going to need them.",Brokeback Mountain
527,aussieukangel,Am I missing something?,7,11 March 2006,"I just finished watching this movie and I have read some of the other peoples comments...am I missing something??? I have rated this movie 7 out of 10 simply because it has some great acting and 2 great actors but as far as the storyline goes...?? I thought the subject matter was very interesting but I think that a little more could have been done with it. Maybe I was expecting too much after hearing and reading others comments. I did like the scenery very much and the over all look of the movie, but at times I reached for the remote control thinking I would skip ahead to something interesting. I endured it without skipping ahead and I am not unhappy about that, but I did wonder at times...is this movie nearly over?? I had hoped for a different ending ( can't say too much and spoil it for others ) and I guess the ending we got was what life is like. I would have rated it more than 7 if it was a little shorter in some areas and focused more in other areas. But generally speaking, it is worth watching and judging for yourself. A fairly good way to spend a lazy Sunday afternoon!",Brokeback Mountain
528,bbrown8870,This movie will still be talked about a generation from now.,9,4 March 2006,"I convinced my wife, who is often very socially conservative, to accompany me to see ""Brokeback Mountain"" last night. We both loved it.It moves at its own deliberate pace, but after a few scenes, you realize that a pace any faster would be untrue to the story. Characters develop appropriately. Casting is perfect. Dialogue is just right. The Canadian Rockies play a flawless stunt double for Wyoming. The movie's visual sweep adds to the enjoyment is actually integral to the plot.If you fail to see this movie because ""gay cowboys really don't do it for me"", you are missing the point. This is an extremely well-crafted, intelligent, adult (in every sense of the word) piece of cinematic art. If you see this movie and can honestly say that you didn't enjoy, you'd better stick to ""Leave It To Beaver"" re-runs. That was the portrayal of a comfortable world. ""Brokeback Mountain"" portrays a very uncomfortable contemporary version.These tough young men are equal to the challenges of nature without, but are no match for nature within. Supervisory tyranny, social prejudice, family issues are challenging enough for anyone. They deal even-handedly with life situations most of us would blanch at, but have no answer for love. They are rational, Ennis more than Jack, and approach horrendously difficult tasks with equanimity, even disdain. They are irrational, even rash, however, when dealing practically with their feeling for each other. Watching it all unwind was the best entertainment I've enjoyed at a movie since ""Private Ryan."" That's high praise.A tiny quibble: There is one tiny editing error, but it occurs at an awkward moment for the story. There is a fly or some other small, black insect on Ennis's right cheek, down by the jaw. You see it from the front when he's in a highly intense conversation with Jack. The camera switches to Jack's face where you now see Ennis from behind. The bug is gone. Back to Ennis--voilà! The bug is still there. Insect predation is not at all unusual for that altitude, but it distracted me from what was one of the most gripping dialogs in the entire plot.The net is that I really CARED about these characters and can't get them out of my head, not that I'm trying. If you're of age, please, see this movie.",Brokeback Mountain
529,finding-something,Quite Possibly,10,16 March 2006,"This might be the best movie ever; certainly one of the most potent.A thank you to the actors, the director, whoever was in charge of cinematography, and Ms. Proulx. Simply amazing. Honestly, Brokeback Mountain has ruined all other movies for me. This is a rather happy shame.While it is obvious anyone involved in the project invested in it completely, Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams gave absolutely legendary performances. I found myself hoping Ms. Williams would end up in other scenes throughout the film. She animated Alma and gave her to audiences without any sort of reservation. Mr. Ledger's performance was nearly flawless as well. The story and the movie are both powerful. I don't know if I can say that about any other movie I've ever seen. And I'm afraid I've seen too many.As for the film's ""controversial"" nature, what controversy? It is a love story. Love is messy, wrong, and destructive. Love can be shared between two men, and whether that is wrong or right, the movie provides no commentary. Homosexuality is far from glorified in this movie. That would be grotesque. It is, however, shown as a reality. Love has consequences no matter its makers. This movie is beautiful, and should be watched. I don't care who you are.",Brokeback Mountain
530,s_cadzow,Best Film of 2005,10,20 January 2006,"Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain is an extremely powerful and moving film. While Ang Lee's level of direction is now commonly known to go hand in hand with excellence, the level that Lee is on with Brokeback Mountain is something that few films in history have ever achieved. Despite a limited release and a hesitant reception in the box office, Brokeback Mountain is a film that will not let its raw power be denied by unwilling critics.Based on the short story by E. Annie Proulx, Brokeback Mountain is the heart-wrenching tale of two cowboys, Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal), who meet one summer while working together as cattle hands on Brokeback Mountain in 1963. While their co-worker relationship starts off awkward and standoffish, Jack's outgoing charm finally finds its way through Ennis's quiet and rough defenses, exposing two men unsure with the directions of their lives. The only thing that Ennis Del Mar knows, is that once he gets off Brokeback, he and his fiancé Alma (Michelle Williams) are getting married and starting a family. Through the loneliness and cold nights spent on Brokeback, Jack and Ennis, to their own surprise, stumble across a love interest between them that will change their lives forever.Now, for a film that's subject matter alone for one reason or another causes some of America to cringe, you can imagine the delivery of such intense roles would be an incredible task, and that is exactly what we get in Brokeback Mountain, absolutely incredible performances. Every scene between Ledger and Gyllenhaal is electrifying. There are multiple instances while watching the exchanges between the two that I realized I had literally stopped breathing from their performances. After their first night making love, Jack and Ennis share a quiet scene on a hillside where Ennis says, ""You know I ain't queer,"" then near the films end, while the two are talking about how hard it is to see each other so little, Ennis chokes out through his tears ""Well, why don't you? Why don't you just let me be? It's because of you that I'm like this! I ain't got nothing... I ain't nowhere... Get the f**k off me! I can't stand being like this no more, Jack!"" Now you think about the contrast in those two crucial lines, and imagine the development that Ledger and Gyllenhaal go through during the film, and it is undeniable that the two of them are at their absolute best.To only talk about the men of Brokeback would be unfair, Michelle Williams who plays Alma, Ennis's wife, and Anne Hathaway who plays Lureen, Jack's wife, also deliver dynamic performances. The composure and character that these two wives have to maintain through the years, knowing that Alma is aware of the affair and clued in that Lureen has a quiet suspicion, is numbing. There is a very intense scene where Jack pays a visit to Ennis's apartment, and while the two are ravishing each other behind the stairwell we watch as Alma sees them through the front door. From that scene on, the relationship between Ledger and Williams in the film is like a ticking bomb, a bomb that the audience has no idea when it is going to explode.To separate a great movie from a good movie, you need everything, but most of all you need direction, and this is the strongest point of Brokeback Mountain. Ang Lee uses the vast scenery of Wyoming to accompany his actors in such an indescribable way, combined with the phenomenal camera work of Rodrigo Prieto, that it just keeps carving away at you with its beauty. Without many words spoken for the majority of the opening, Ang Lee's direction already has you hooked, it already has you interested, and it already has you committed. Every scene in Brokeback Mountain has a point, and every scene is used to further the plot. With so much beauty surrounding the already beautiful story, Brokeback can get extremely heavy on your heart.While the subject matter of Brokeback Mountain can at first be a shock to some, you have to remember at its heart, Brokeback Mountain is a love story, as sincere as they come. This is a film that exposes everything and holds nothing back. Everything in Brokeback Mountain is on it's A-game, the performances, especially the bare all performances given by Ledger and Gyllenhaal, the Oscar worthy direction of Ang Lee, and the jaw dropping cinematography of Rodrigo Prieto. While I'm sure you've heard it a thousand times before about thousands of other movies, but if you see just one movie this year, see Brokeback Mountain.",Brokeback Mountain
531,theshape-13,A hauntingly beautiful love story that will stay with you!,9,14 March 2006,"I entered the screening of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN with the most open of minds and left emotionally drained. When a movie can do that to you, then you know you have been deeply entertained. BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN has been constantly referred to as a 'gay cowboy' film, but that unfortunate label doesn't even begin to describe the film.In their star-making & Oscar-nominated performances, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal portray Ennis & Jack, two sheepherders hired to watch over a flock of sheep on the movie title's mountain. The two men are polar opposites - Ennis is the mumbly, quiet chain-smoker engaged to be married while Jack is the younger, idealistic one. One cold night, Jack has Ennis sleep in the tent so Ennis doesn't freeze and from that point the real story begins. The attraction the two men feel is foreign and scary to both of these good ol' boys. Their physical encounter is passionate & aggressive - something Jack & Ennis have never experienced with others. It is on this night that the men form their 'bond' - a love for one another that cannot be spoken of to others, yet they deny themselves the chance to be together. The fateful day comes when their jobs end and both men go their separate ways and attempt to live 'normal lives. Ennis marries Alma and has 2 girls; Jack also ties the knot and sires a son. Over the course of 20 years, the men meet up and unify their bond. Of course, with any great love story ultimately comes tragedy...To label BROKEBACK the 'gay cowboy' film is ludicrous, in my opinion. This is a film of raw human emotion, pure and simple. Everyone wants love - everyone wants to be in love. The love between Jack and Ennis is tangible and powerful, yet these two plain ordinary men cannot explain it, even to themselves. Their actual conversations are few and far between, but in the case of Ennis, his silence speaks volumes! The performances in this film is really what blew me away. Heath Ledger is a revelation - his Ennis Del Mar is a tortured soul, a man who cannot have the love he wants. Jake Gyllenhaal is very good in the less showy role of Jack Twist. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway are dead-on as the respective wives of Ennis and Jack.This movie deserves its long life! As the film's tag line says - ""Love is a Force of Nature"". I will carry this movie with me for a long time to come.",Brokeback Mountain

I had a hard time not hitting the fast forward button on my remote control. Can someone please tell me what the fuss was about, or better yet, why it has won several Oscars? To me the story line deserved more elaboration than it was given. I was not quite convinced of the genuine love between the two main characters. And come on, to me a love story does not need to show a lot of flesh, but a bit of fumbling in the dark is very, very prudish.

So I saw, the upset loser of the 2006 Academy Awards. All I can say is Brokeback was robbed. I liked ""Crash"" too, but Brokeback's acting, directing, screenplay is much better. Being that I grew up in L.A., I kinda know why ""Crash"" won, but just because Brokeback was the butt of many jokes and still is, it doesn't mean this film should be discarded. Movie fans will surely consider this a ""classic love story"" and landmark cinema. Superb direction from Ang Lee, remarkable performances from Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams and the rest of the acting crew. The accompanying music, part classical, part country western, sets the mood just right. Human emotions are very complex. Brokeback Mountain sets a perfect example.

534,sideburnmikeguitar,Let's be honest,6,10 December 2006,"Ang Lee's a fine director. Any intelligent person knows this. The photography was great, dialog seemed realistic, the acting...Well, what do you expect when the basic premise was envisioned by a character on South Park? To be fair, I found Ledger to be surprisingly convincing. On the other hand Jake's ridiculous accent, prop comic-looking mustache and ""I wish I knew how to quit you"" were pathetic. When this movie was released (you're welcome: I didn't say ""came out""), it was promoted as a love story and about how people don't understand the community involved. Awfully preachy for a movie that got so many angry at the ""hypocritical"" religious community. Beyond that, little time was spent showing how the actions of the characters affected their families. The wives take up all of 15 minutes of the movie it seems. Neither is offered an explanation or apology as far as I can tell. They're relegated to shame--whenever someone cheats on someone else whether they're gay or straight it's the same universal idea--for being left behind, not good enough. If the two really loved each other and if it was really a love story, not politically motivated, then it could've been shot as a married hetero couple having an affair...oh but that would've been wrong (which IS true). The wives have to feel shame for trying to change men who are in effect cowards because they refuse to ""be who they truly are."" It's effective in making you feel for characters involved, but for me it was more for their families. There's a touching scene at the end that has an odd uncomfortable resolution where you'll feel this no matter what. Still, Gyllenhal's out of place acting (the rest of the cast do quite well) and the awkward push for the viewer to accept this as a pure love story are too much to make it anywhere near the masterpiece it's proclaimed to be.",Brokeback Mountain
535,Homogeek,Brokeback Mountain Soars,10,13 March 2007,"In all of the thousands movies I see there is usually one common theme. Be it Jolie with Pitt or Crowe with Zellweger it is all 'boy meets girl'. Brokeback Mountain is a 'boy meets boy story'. There are plenty of gay centric movies that are released direct to video, however direct to video does not have the budget of a big picture or are as well done. And they certainly do not have a career performance that Heath Ledger gives in Brokeback Mountain. The movie starts out in 1963 with Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal), a rodeo cowboy wannabe; and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger), a man of very few words, as they get summer jobs herding sheep. They are to take the herd of 3,000 sheep to the highlands for the summer. Some whiskey and the cold mountain night gets both of them in the same tent together. One thing leads to another. Although the sex is pivotal in the movie it is not what the movie is about. The film looks at the men's relationship as it evolves over years. There is that uncomfortable period immediately after a one night stand. Ennis states that ""He ain't no queer"". What gets them through this is that up in the mountains there are no one else to turn to and you eventually have to talk. At the end of the summer they say goodbye, Jack is ready to take this relationship further but Ennis is engaged to Alma (Michelle Williams) and he has no intentions of leaving her at the alter. Ennis does marry, as does Jack, they have families that grow. After four years apart, Ennis finds Jack has sent him a post card. Ennis replies with ""Hell yeah"". We check in with Jack and Ennis several times over the next twenty years. We see the years pass in the fashions and as their children grow up. Jack and Ennis establish a ""fishing trip"" two to three times a year to return to Brokeback Mountain. The fishing trips comes at the cost of Ennis's marriage to Alma (he never brings home any fish), but it is something that Ennis can not give up. In 1963 Wyoming, two men just cannot live together with out raised eyebrows. Ennis recounts two ""bachelor"" ranchers in the community that he grows up in. After years together the ""bachelors"" were the local scandal. One year when Ennis was eight, a group of the local boys decided to teach the ""bachelors"" a lesson by torturing them, literally, to death. Ennis's father forces him and his brother to view a tortured corpse and it leaves a lasting impression on Ennis. Ennis pays this cost but not alone, he loves Alma but cannot commit to their marriage. Alma loves him but cannot live with his ""fishing trips"". Jack loves him but Ennis cannot accept that lifestyle. Ennis's Children also pay when he and Alma divorce. Gyllenhaal did a fine job as Jack Twist; It is Ledger's Ennis Del Mar that is amazing (could this be the same Ledger from 'A Knight's Tale'?). Ledger takes the role of a man that has not much to say and speaks volumes. Ledger shows how Ennis struggles with every short sentence.

Its been called ""the greatest movie ever made about 'gay cowboys''' but, there's more to this film than that. Brokeback is more about finding real love with someone, that in society is forbidden, and about their longing to make this secret love real and unhidden. Its not just about 2 gay guys 'going at it'. You rarely see them do any really ""controversial"", but you don't need to see those sort of things to make you realize this love is real. Ledger and Gyllenhaal show us their true acting talent, followed with a great supporting cast, including Elma, played wonderfully by Michelle Williams. Now, I know I can't convince those with hardcore beliefs to see this film, but no-one can understand or criticize anything without experiencing it first.

538,thomasaaa123,Great movie. Some minor points,9,22 May 2006,"It's a very good movie. The cinematography, setting and performance combine to create lasting emotional impacts. Indeed, there's already many reviewers who have said enough good things about the movie  and I agree with most of them. I would rather point out certain things about the movie which I don't feel 100% happy with.1. The movie is much about the tension between what one feels inside and the constraints imposed by the outside. Heath Ledger did an amazing job embodying such a tension. Bravo! But the same cannot be said of Jake Gyllenhaal's performance. To be fair, Gyllenhaal's character Jack Twist is likely to be less mentally tormented by the social pressure. But what's troubling Jack more is the frustration of not having the life he DARES to have. At times I feel Gyllenhaal could have done better expressing this kind of frustration.2. The most romantic scene, to me, was the one that's shown near the end  a flashback where Ennis was holding Jack from behind and whispering to him soothing words. Of course, their feelings for each other were sown when they were sheepherding. But I was not sure how emotionally intimate they actually were and how the feelings were developed back in Brokeback  besides a couple of sex scenes (one of which happened when they were kind of drunk), we were only shown that they were talking like friends. Only during the flashback near the end did I get a slightly better idea.3. It's related to the previous point, and is not really a criticism. I am not sure whether it was each other or actually the environ free of social judgment that Ennis and Jack longed for. Put another way, is this movie more about the love between the two leads, or people's love for transitorily breaking away from convention and expressing one's true feelings? Maybe it's both  maybe the two kinds of love complement each other. And maybe it's not important to distinguish the two. It seems to me that Jack truly loved Ennis, but Ennis might love the freedom more than he loved Jack.",Brokeback Mountain
539,macrths,wonderful love story,10,5 May 2006,"This movie was absolutely amazing! It was very powerful and emotional, one of the most moving films of the year.It's basically a love story, featuring cowhand Ennis Del Mar (played by Heath Ledger) and aspiring rodeo cowboy Jack Swift (played surprisingly well by Jake Gyllenhaal). The pair meet while herding sheep on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming.No surprise, Ennis and Jack hit it off and soon fall in love. Unfortunately, Ennis is engaged to be married. They decide that whatever happens at Brokeback stays at Brokeback and the two part ways in the fall.Of course, every story has a catch, and Ennis's now wife, Alma (played wonderfully by Michelle Williams, another surprise. Who knew the gal from Dawson's Creek could act?)catches her husband kissing his fishing buddy outside. (Of course, Jack drops by for a visit but he and Ennis can't wait five minutes to get a room.) Alma is hurt and after a surprisingly long while, files for divorce. Who could blame her? I'd be angry if I caught my husband kissing another man.Then there's more trouble in paradise, when Jack marries the daughter of a rich businessman. So the two meet for more ""fishing trips"" on Brokeback Mountain.I was very surprised about the film, I was told that it was disgusting but other than one gay sex scene in the boys' tent, it was not really all that explicit. The scenery was fantastic (I think it was shot in BC) and the music was beautiful. It was very thought provoking and definitely made you think. It was also very sad, as told in the last scene when Ennis is holding Jack's shirt at home, after his daughter told Ennis she was getting married.All in all it was a wonderful film, but not for those who are faint of heart or who only want to see Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal have gay sex.

It's their loss because this is an extremely well made, beautiful and hauntingly sad movie.This isn't a gay movie. It's a story of forbidden love not entirely unlike other such stories except the vehicle, in this case, is a taboo that still exists in western society. (that's NOT western because they're cowboys, but you know that)So many people are staying away from seeing this fine picture. The talk lately has been that people are avoiding it, despite the rave reviews, because it involves a gay relationship. It's ironic that this is the same general reaction that encases the two men in the movie with fear of having people discover how they feel about each other.My friends that refuse to see this movie will happily see outrageously violent movies. They don't worry that people will think they are going to run out and kill someone yet I know that some of them are refusing because of fear that people will think they may be gay because they've seen a 'gay cowboy' movie.As sad as it is to think this, maybe those gay cowboys were right to hide.",Brokeback Mountain
541,naun,Random thoughts on a third viewing,10,29 January 2006,"Brokeback Mountain has finally come to my town, and I can finally view it at my leisure. It is a movie that rewards repeated viewings. There's been so much said about this film that there hardly seems to be any point in writing a review, but here at least are a few random observations.Before this viewing I'd finally managed to get hold of the ""story to screenplay"" book. Larry McMurtry's essay, though only a couple of pages long, is a knockout piece of writing. One of the things he talks about is the contrast between the big landscapes and the small lives of the people in it. There's a recurring editing trick in the movie that makes me think of the same thing. I think they call it an inline cut, but at any rate it's where you first view an object (or a person) from a distance, then closer up from exactly the same angle.Some visual parallels struck me for the first time on this viewing. When Ennis gets the first postcard from Jack, he strokes its border the same way he does with the postcard at the end of the film. Time and again we are shown that, for an outdoorsman, Ennis can be remarkably gentle with his hands, and this is another example of it. And when he gets the fatal postcard, the camera swings behind his shoulder to an angle reminiscent of the one we see in the dead rancher scene. His visit to the Twist home also subtly recalls his first meeting with Jack, with the truck being seen from its right as it pulls in, and Jack's mother at the door.Another thing that struck me this time is the way Jack's posture and body language remain the same through the years, only, well, older. The passage of years takes a greater toll on him than on Ennis, if only because Ennis was never all that young to begin with. I've reversed my earlier opinion that they don't age Jack convincingly during the course of the film. The makeup tricks are there if you look for them, but *emotionally* the change in his appearance is right: he gets more drawn, more edgy, more brittle, and his costume and makeup reflect this change.Jake Gyllenhaal is being robbed blind this awards season. Look how much he can convey with a hopeful rise of the eyebrows, or a hesitation in his speech. His character is finely drawn and all of a piece. But I also noticed this time how Heath Ledger actually manages to work some comic timing into his taciturn portrayal of Ennis. Little pauses mean a lot in this film. Oh, and how superbly Michelle Williams does the pent-up silences and the ensuing outbursts in the ""Jack Nasty"" scene. She's a wonderful *voice* actor on top of everything else.I always marvel at the performances of the two older actors as Jack's parents. This time I noticed how much of the impact of Peter McRobbie's performance as the father comes from the asymmetrical lighting and the unnerving movement of his eyes. I've come to think of his character as ""the black and white monster"" because of the lighting: maybe he is seen black and white because that is how he sees the world. This is also the scene where religious objects hover fuzzily in the background, something I can recall from at least one Ingmar Bergman film I've seen. (My favourite Bergman film: Winter Light.) In one shot it's a cross, in another a cowboy hat hangs above Ennis' head like a halo.In scene after scene you notice the subtly (well, everything in this film is subtle) atmospheric use of ambient sound and music. Little things like the fact that you already hear the gentle trickling of a river outside the tent after their first night together -- the river signifying, as somebody suggested here, the passage of time (""same river twice""). Or the sound of the wind in so many scenes. Or the tinny noises of the television sets and other electrical appliances in the domestic scenes. Or the way we cut from LaShawn's gabbiness to Alma Jr's quietness. I've come to love Gustavo Santaolalla's score as well, deceptively plain but full of unexpected cadences, tracking every nuance of mood. People rightly talk about the two tent scenes but the whole sequence in between them is every bit as remarkable, with shots of stark and disturbing beauty, and those strange woodwind tones in the soundtrack.And with each viewing I marvel more than ever at Ang Lee's ability to weave together multiple emotional strands, as in the leadup to the first fishing trip, when we move in rapid succession from a sort of domestic farce to Alma's heartbreak to the liberating vistas of the mountains as the truck arcs its way towards them. Nobody can modulate emotional tone from scene to scene, or even within a scene, the way Lee can. At his best he can sustain this feat through an entire movie, as he does here. There's a kind of visual music that flows through the whole film.More than anything else I've come to love the tempo, the rhythm, the texture of the film. There's a quiet warmth that runs right through it, a kind of savouring of ordinary life, of domestic things, of everyday toil, of companionship and solitude, of private griefs, of shared days and nights. Nothing is romanticized, yet nothing ever feels jaded. I'm no art connoisseur, but I vividly remember the effect that Millet's peasant paintings had on me when I first saw them, and there's something of the same spirit here. This is a film that, in the midst of the larger tragedy, never stops being grateful for the most commonplace things in life.",Brokeback Mountain

544,stratsz28,"Slow down the hype machine, this movie is just plain boring",3,9 January 2006,"Let this be the first and last time I mention that my review has nothing to do with ripping apart a 'gay cowboy movie'.This movie bored me endlessly. First, I think the character development was lacking. Basically, by the movie's end, I felt no closer to any of the main characters. I didn't care about their losses or their tribulations because I never felt like I got to know them. In addition, the direction and cinematography were subpar. The action was slow, the camera shots too swooping, and the emotion forced. There were also many scenes that seemed omissible and pointless.The acting was OK, although it's difficult to evaluate acting when the characters basically sit with blank stares and don't talk for the entire film. I think Donnie Darko turned in the best performance.As a love story, this one doesn't hold up. As I mentioned, I didn't care about the characters, no matter what happened to their hapless relationship. Also, very little of the story actually serves to develop Jack and Ennis's love for each other.I'm not even sure to whom I should recommend this movie. I would compare this movie to that one IFC film in which the old guy drives his tractor across the country to visit his dying brother because he doesn't have his license. What a bore.Apparently, if you've read the story, this movie captures the spirit well. I advise you just read the story; save yourself the $10 and 2.5 hours.",Brokeback Mountain

But now, 15 years later, it has a whole new meaning.",Brokeback Mountain
546,geebeegb1,A tragic love story - give me a break.,2,17 February 2006,"I am still trying to understand the appeal of Brokeback Mountain. Here is a movie about two men who have sex during a stint of watching a flock of sheep. Then they go on to marry (women), have children, and, instead of being faithful to their wives and families, meet every so often to have sex. They talk about getting a place together but never have the ""you know whats"" to be honest to themselves and families. Therefore they remain in their marriages, making everyone miserable. I do not recall ever hearing the word ""love"" from either one to the other. The only phrase remotely in that ballpark was, ""I wish I knew how to quit you"". I am sorry but these two are selfish, cowardly, and unable to control their physical attraction. Just because their relationship lasted years doesn't make it love. If they were that much in love, they should have been honest and made a life together instead of destroying others.The scenery and music seems to give this movie much more credence than it really deserves. The real tragedy is the hype surrounding it. I rate it a 2 for the mountains and music.",Brokeback Mountain
547,evo8mr,very beautiful love story,10,17 January 2006,"This movie might be the strongest movie of the year. The photography, the direction, acting and above all the passion that went into this delicately made movie. What a beautiful love story.Heath Ledger plays Ennis Del Mar, a man brooding with anger and resentment who's also missing something in his life. When Ennis goes to Brokeback mountain, there he meets Jack Twist, played by Jake Gyllenhaal. Heath Ledger plays this man with almost bitter resentment and with something boiling inside of him. When he lashes out in different ways and then he finishes, you feel as though he still hasn't peaked. What a STRONG performance by Ledger.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Jack Twist, a rodeo rider and Ledger's other half. The way Gyllenhaal personifies Twist is unbelievable. His mannerisms, speech, and open kindness makes Twist one kind kind person in movie history. Again, strong performance, this makes Gyllenhaal's performance in Proof and Jarhead look amateur at best.Another revelation here is Michelle Williams, who plays Alma Beers Del Mar, Ennis' wife. She's winningly effective as the long suffering wife. Williams throws backs Ledger's punches and makes a real effect on her husband. Her chemistry with Ledger in this movie WORKS, and they are constantly believable as a married couple.Ultimately the movie is about the love story between Ledger and Gyllenhaal and their chemistry is undeniable. Much stronger than what Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt had in 'Mr and Mrs Smith' (don't mean to compare the two). This is definitely one of the best movies of the year.",Brokeback Mountain
548,sccoverton,"Far from Oscar-worthy direction, which at times approaches cliché",5,6 April 2006,"Not being a great fan of Ang Lee, after his dilute-to-taste Crouching Tiger, I had to steel myself in order to approach this film impartially. I should note that I watched this film for the first time post-hype and post-Oscars.It became almost instantly, and thereafter increasingly, clear that Lee didn't deserve the Best Director Oscar. The direction is clumsy, and often unimaginative. For the first half of the film, I felt rather detached from the two main characters, and this meant that I felt very little empathy (or even sympathy) for them in the concluding half. Clearly one of the main facets of the film is denial or disavowal, but I think Lee overplays it in his mise en scene, and his actor direction, and thereby fails to provide any emotional attachment for the audience.His handling of homosexuality is deeply clichéd and very obviously comes from a (not just cinematic) tradition of very little understanding of, or empathy for, the subject. The sex is depicted as aggressive, even violent, which is how homosexuality has typically been portrayed by the mainstream, and this portrayal has only really ever been refuted by gay cinema itself. It was also a rather hackneyed and superficial idea to show Heath Ledger buggering his wife, as if anal sex were the exclusive territory of gay men (which, like AIDS, it definitely isn't). It is for this reason, perhaps, that Brokeback sits so comfortably with the heterosexual mainstream, in the same way that Miranda from ""Sex and the City"" does. I would suggest that simply exposing the mainstream to these uncomfortable subjects, if done in a familiar and predictable way, doesn't educate or provoke thought, it merely reinforces existing prejudices and gives narrow-mindedness a sheen of justification.The supporting characters are forgettable and have unclear roles in the film, which ultimately exposes the script as being unfocused and rather thin, with the ideas being few and overstretched at feature-length.To the film's credit, the very final scene - the final shot, in fact - is tastefully and professionally executed, and provides a genuine moment of empathy and emotiveness, although it lacks in its want of preceding scenes of emotional engagement. The cinematography is noteworthy too - it must have been a real achievement getting consistent exposures outside and in the dark scenes, and it's such a pleasure to see a film with *real* landscapes in the age of ""let them CG it in in post"".Overall, Brokeback Mountain is not a bad film, and while it was a brave choice for the Oscars politically, if not a sound choice artistically, it hardly goes down as a great film. I can't imagine anyone including it in their top ten, or even top 100 films even just a year from now.",Brokeback Mountain
549,redwing1499,Open your mind and see it no matter what your views on anything explored in the film,9,5 January 2006,"I've been hearing about this movie for weeks and curiosity killed the cat with me. I was expecting a movie about 2 men who simply get together just for fun because they enjoy each other's company. To be honest, my assumptions were very pedantic. This is unlike any movie you have ever seen. It is not about being gay, it's about loving another person so much that being without them hurts them as much as it hurts you. I know that a lot of people wanna put labels on it and argue about it until next year but you really have to see the film before you judge it. Like the 2 main characters, it takes a lot of courage to play a gay man when you are straight and I think they deserve props simply for their willingness to do it and making it a believable story. I'm a straight woman and I fell in love with Heath and Jake.This may be the best 2 & 1/2 hours you spend at the theater for a long time. You won't regret it.",Brokeback Mountain
550,bfreilly,Let me just check my watch...,6,19 July 2006,"I should have guessed from the first six or so minutes of the movie. We see Ennis (Heath Ledger) arrive at the head ranchers office first. He looks around, stands by the door, and waits. A minute or so passes. Then, Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) drives up in rather rickety truck. He gets out, shares a glance with Ennis, and gets back in the truck. More time passes. There was a point during this rather overly extended scene where I thought that the store had screwed up and given me a copy of ""Waiting for Godot"". But as soon as the owner (Randy Quaid) shows up, I put those negative thoughts to rest. It's sure to pick up soon, I reflected rather naively.Unfortunately for me, the entire movie runs like that introductory scene. It is verrrrry slooooow. Normally, I can sit through movies like this. There are a few that I have come to respect despite their leisurely pace. Not this one, though. Portions of this movie run like they've been dipped in molasses. I must admit, there are some portions that movie extremely fast; to whit, the relationship between the two. How do two people proceed from idle chit-chat to emotional and physical love without some intervening steps? I may be wrong, but I'm pretty sure meaningful relationships don't work that way. One-night stands yes, deep connections no.I can't really fault this film for trying. The makers of ""Brokeback"" shot for a rather high goal and I applaud them for doing so. The message of love and acceptance is an outstanding one, and everyone in the world would be a lot better off if they realized that just those with alternative lifestyles are no threat to the status quo just because of whom they love. That's a great message. The movie... not so much.Considering that I've only seen this movie once and walked out before the ending, my review might not be the best critique around. But I'm willing to be fair. At the very least, as fair as I could possible be under the circumstances. I'm going to give this movie one last try, but I'm not holding my breath; mainly because I could pass out from oxygen deprivation during those longer scenes.",Brokeback Mountain
551,yaadpyar,Still savoring the experience...,10,25 December 2005,"I won't talk about plot here - the story has to be experienced; another summary just sounds trivial and reductive. The story is told with such honesty and authenticity, never stooping to clichés in character or plot, and while it's deeply touching, it's never sentimental.Heath & Jake are both amazing at completely inhabiting these men, and bringing us in the middle of a love that is all about what happens when love can't be acknowledged or expressed, a story that transcends sexual identity in every way. Anyone who has loved knows the torture of trying to express what can't be expressed, and trying to hide what won't stay hidden.I saw it alone, and would like to do so again. The solitude allowed me to immerse myself in this experience and not be distracted by anyone else's opinion. For a couple of hours, I was living with these two men and their families, pulled into their relationship and learning as much about myself as them as the movie unfolded.I am so thankful to the original author for her story, and even more so to Ang Lee for creating a cinematic experience that I will savor for a long, long time to come.",Brokeback Mountain

I just had to see a movie that was ""Good"" enough to receive 8 Oscar nods.I was disappointed. I felt like I wasted money on a political movie that had no entertainment value what so ever.Numerous years ago I walked out of Interview with a Vampire asking for a refund. I came really close to walking out of this movie. People say that Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal where brilliant. I found that both actors where on par when compared to their previous works which where not that great.There is not an ounce of quality to Brokeback Mountain. This movie is pure hype. Movies like this have come and gone and slowly fade away once the hype wears off. It might win an academy award if it does, it won't matter. It's a par movie that has massive political motives behind it.People get tired of movies like this. I hope the academy sees through the political hype.

I saw it at a neighborhood theater last night and think it's the best movie since 1999's American Beauty. I'm probably a natural audience, being gay and living on the coast, but I'm also open to learning about and appreciating the totally alien cowboy/C&W ""lifestyle"" and at 50 hardly a sentimental teenager (in fact, I've grown resistant to sentimentality). This film and story is rich for those willing to see it without prejudice. No special effects, nothing was predictable, shocking only because it tells the truth: Love is never easy and often destructive; following your own path in opposition to social norms is dangerous; knowing another person is always difficult and drawn out; and in the end the only thing that matters is that we loved (not ""how"") and cared. Poverty is uncomfortable and degrading, but survivable by a nourished soul. Talking too much, and too little, puts up a barrier that others can't cross. The only slight negative for me was that some of the editing made me think of Dances With Wolves and Bridges of Madison County -- both wonderful films but to be a ""10"" something must be totally original. Have I ever known (and loved) an Ennis? You bet. Some guys grow up hardscrabble, fearful, not listened to and unable to trust. Mix in being socially condemned by a shallow culture and the road to redemption is rocky indeed. In a microwave world, Brokeback Mountain is a fully realized emotional feast.",Brokeback Mountain

When I saw it for the first time on the silver screen I was slightly confused as what to think of it. If anything I was sort of numb but in a good way, and very,very,happy,and at the same time very sad because of the ending. The film was like a dream come true except for Jake's tragic death.

You can really see the chemistry between Ennis and Jack, something that is usually done in poor taste. The love scenes seemed genuine and true, instead of raunchy or pornographic. Heath and Jake really got into their characters, and showed believable emotion when they were missing each other.

Ennis Del Mar is a hardworking man engaged to marry his fiancée, Alma and Jack Twist is a rodeo cowboy living in Texas. The two work together that summer, herding sheep in brokeback mountain. The two form a friendship which becomes much more when they fall in love. When the summer ends, the two go their separate ways.As time goes by, Ennis marries Alma and have two daughters while Jack marries Lureen Newsome, daughter of a wealthy tractor owner, and have a son, Bobby. Ennis and Jack meet four years later, in 1967. When they meet, they hug and Ennis pulls Jack aside to kiss him which Alma witnesses and becomes heartbroken.During Jack's visit, the two go up to fish at Brokeback Mountain, where Jack tells Ennis how much he cares for him. Jack then tells Ennis that he wants to be with him always and make a commitment, to leave their wives, live together with their own ranch, and have a wonderful life. However, Ennis shows no emotion or commitment to Jack's dream. Although Jack's hurt by Ennis' words, the two decide to meet every four years and continue their relationship in secret.As time goes by, Alma becomes fed up with Ennis' lack of supporting the kids even though she still harbors heartbreak from discovering her husband's secret life. The two divorce in '75 and Jack comes after wards thinking that Ennis is finally ready for a commitment. He is met with heartbreak when Ennis says that he isn't and the divorce wasn't over wanting to be with Jack. Jack leaves saying he'll come by next month and while driving away, brings emotional sobs for he pines for Ennis. Instead of heading back to Texas, Jack drives to Mexico where he picks up a male prostitute.Time continues to go by and even though Jack still pines for Ennis he begins a relationship with Randall Malone. Ennis is also confronted by Alma about his love affair with Jack which results in an argument and gets him into a fight later on.In 1983, Jack and Ennis meet for their annual get together, and have an emotional fight which results in Jack holding a crying Ennis tightly. But the ending will leave Ennis in realization of what he could of had yet lost.'Brokeback Mountain' is an emotional, heart wrenching, and well done movie. This movie will truly grasp the concept of love and bend your mind about relationships between different people. The movie not only tugs at your heart for its emotional performances but for those that become emotional hurt. Yet the ending will sadden you yet break your heart at the same time.I throughly enjoyed this movie. Although some scenes were a bit difficult to see, I still throughly enjoyed this movie that left me in tears by the end.

557,ReneWirtz,Wonderfully Slow,8,19 March 2006,"First off, the cinematography and sceneries are beautiful and the acting is very controlled and introverted. This last part enables the movie to stay far away from being a run-of-the-mill tearjerker, also aided by the absence of a dramatic, violin-fueled score.Secondly, the story line subtly has multiple layers, because this movie is not just about homosexual sheep herders, in fact I believe it is hardly about that; it's more about oppression, racism, religion, the fast changing times of the 60s and 70s and how different people i different stages of society deal with those.There's very little dialogue, but the body language tells the viewer so much, that words are really unnecessary and that is something that Ang Lee really did well. One point of criticism is that the movie runs too long. At the point where Ennis leaves Jack's parents is where it should have ended, because then the opening and ending scenes would have been identical. And the part after this shot really didn't add to the story or character development.All in all I give it 8 out of 10, because this movie shows how delicate relationships, any relationship, can be. And it does so in a non-judgmental manner.",Brokeback Mountain
558,theantigaz,A Film About Relationships,9,28 January 2006,"I went to see this film out of curiosity more than anything. I knew very little about it other than the usual media tagging of it being that 'gay cowboy film'. I wanted to know what all the fuss was about, was it truly a great film, or was it just getting media attention due to a mass-media perceived controversial subject matter? I was pleasantly surprised.From a cinematic point of view, Ang Lee has done a fantastic job of capturing the beauty and the desperation of parts of rural America. Showing the magnificent natural scenery to great effect and convincingly transporting his audience to the little farming communities and cowboy towns of Wyoming and it surrounding regions. The music is moving and fits perfectly with what you are seeing on the screen. An understated score perfectly adds to the atmosphere and feeling that the story generates. The costumes and sets create a convincing backdrop to the period of the story.Heath Ledger absolutely excels in his role as Ennis, a man of very few words with a lot on his mind. I came away from the film with the idea that Ennis was a man who had extreme difficulty communicating his feelings with others. This is most likely why when he experiences what he does with Jack on Brokeback that summer, he fails to cope with his own feelings, let alone those of the ones around him. Ang Lee has made this film cleverly, he never thrusts an opinion upon his audience about the characters or the decisions they make, he concentrates on analysing their reactions to the events which unfold and the way they deal with them. It is fairly obvious that homosexual relationships met with far more suspicion and disgust in the 1960s than they are in more modern times, especially in more rural areas.This film could have easily been about two men who fell in love in a time when it was not accepted. Brokeback Mountain however, goes much deeper than this. It does not just show Ennis and Jack and victims of the time they lived in, but shows the decisions they made and the impacts it had on their lives. Jack throughout the film comes across as more accepting of his nature, where as Ennis appears to struggle more with it. But as I said before, this film is not just about 'gay cowboys', it is more of a film about relationships. The relationships between two worker who become lovers, the relations ships they both form after their season together, the relationships they would face with society and their relationships with themselves in a less understanding era.Heath Ledger is in outstanding form throughout this film. Playing almost a tortured soul character with many difficult decisions to make about his life and himself. Jake Gyllanhall is also very good, but HEath just steals the show. Playing a man who says very few words, but he manages to convey a volume of emotion through his expression, body language and tone during the limited times he speaks out.Of course most people will think of Brokeback Mountain as that 'gay cowboy' film, but my advice to them is go and see it. In all honesty, this film is about relationships between people, it could have feasibly been made with two sets of families involving a 'straight' affair. The homosexuality of the main characters add more depth to this film, rather than detract from the story and the themes of communication, commitment and human nature.Most people will go and see this film and enjoy it, some more blinkered people will see it and be offended by it, worse still some damn ignorant people will refuse to see it and spout abuse and disgust purely because they are not open minded enough to enjoy a film on its own merits. I recommend you go see Brokeback Mountain, it is an intelligent, poignant, sometimes moving and sometimes sad portrayal of two people trying to find happiness with others and within themselves.",Brokeback Mountain

In such a situation, they had to keep their relation as a secret. I love this film because the description and scenery are very beautiful. I think people all over the world should watch this film and think about homosexual love.

560,manjits,Overrated,5,21 April 2007,"Brokeback Mountain is a reasonably good film, but nothing like the hype it's been made out to be. It reminds me a little of John Schlesinger's 1969 movie Midnight Cowboy, which was way ahead of its time. Without denigrating Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal performances, Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight were sensational in Midnight Cowboy. I have seen 4 Ang Lee directed movies (Eat Drink Man Woman, Sense and Sensibility, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and this one), and they all are well-made commercial movies, but none of them are great or original in any way. It was therefore a surprise to me this movie winning best director Oscar. Even the screenplay was very jumpy, and left a lot to be desired - there was no real insight into what the two characters shared emotionally between them to carry on their affair for 20 years, in spite of having girlfriends, wives, children and individual lives of their own. I believe, both the movie and director are bit overrated.",Brokeback Mountain
561,edinburghstoryteller,"Pretty disappointing movie, all in all...",2,7 February 2006,"Ignore all the hype that surrounds this movie. It's been one that produces vastly differing opinions at either end of the scale, but not because of the qualities of the film itself - there's far too much political nonsense wrapped up in the way people are viewing this movie and it should be judged on no more than how efffective it is at portraying the story in question. Too many people seem to have gone into this having already made up their mind that they were going to hate it or that they were going to be mesmerised by it.In truth, it's a fairly ordinary film. If it wasn't about homosexuality it would barely have gotten a mention, but as it is everybody feels the need to show how enlightened they are by writing melodramatic stories about how it's changed their life. That's just another bandwagon for people to jump onto though. In reality, this has a few decent moments, a decent premise and some stunning cinematography; apart from that it's badly put together and ignores far too many details.When I say 'details', I'm talking about the fundamentals, the foundational stuff. For example, the accents start out pretty bad and by the end of the film they're just plain awful. Jake Gyllenhall doesn't know how to ride a horse which - given that he's playing a rodeo rider - is just sloppy directing by Ang Lee. Apart from that though, I thought Gyllenhall was the better of the two main parts. Apart from the accent and the riding he did a very good job with it. Heath Ledger just mumbled a lot.The main problem with this movie is that it was about their struggle to come to terms with what happened up there on Brokeback Mountain - about their inner turmoil over it given their strict, traditional upbringings. With that in mind, they jumped into the sack with each other WAY too easily. It didn't build - it was far too easy a transition for them to go from nothing at all to stroking each other lovingly, and when that's what you're building a film on top of you need to make sure it feels authentic. This just didn't.So overall, some really nice camera-work, some mixed acting, a flimsy plot and a criminal lack of attention to detail adds up to a pretty ordinary movie. I wouldn't bother with it if I were you, but if it's one you want to have an opinion on then then don't expect anything spectacular. The scene with the fireworks is pretty cool though.",Brokeback Mountain

Secondly, I'm sorry but it's talked about as a ""love story,"" but I didn't see the love. All I saw was two guys wanting to get into each other's pants. Two guys so obsessed with sex that they'll endanger all of the other relationships in their lives.(SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW) We learn that on their later fishing trips they didn't fish. Presumably they were humping. When people who truly love each other go on a fishing trip, there is some fishing in addition to the lovemaking.",Brokeback Mountain

564,jcduffy,"Not as great as the hype, but deeply moving",9,3 January 2006,"Perhaps the hype surrounding this film, together with my enthusiasm for the short story on which its based, caused me to go in with my expectations too high, but I found ""Brokeback Mountain"" mildly disappointing. It was a good film, but it wasn't the great film I was hoping for. I'd like to see the film a second time on the big screen, the sign of a good film; but it's not a film I feel a need to own, which would have been the sign of a great film. (By way of a benchmark, recent films that did fall into my must-own category were ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" and ""Goodbye Lenin."") I can't put my finger on why ""Brokeback Mountain"" failed to meet my must-own criteria. The actors gave surprisingly good performances. I was particularly impressed with Anne Hathaway during her phone conversation with Heath Ledger's character--she did an excellent job of conveying her character's private thoughts with just small movements of her eyes. Heath Ledger's various nominations for best actor awards are well deserved, though I hesitate to say his performance actually ought to win those awards. I'd say the same about Ang Lee's nominations for best director. Depending on what the competition is, I wouldn't mind seeing ""Brokeback Mountain"" take the Best Picture trophy at the Oscar's.Still, there was something about the film that didn't quite come together. I was close to crying a couple times, but only close--the film couldn't get me over the edge. (By contrast, I still weep every time I watch the flying Lenin bust in ""Goodbye Lenin."") The film steered well away from the sin of maudlin sentiment, but its emotional energy didn't come into the tight focus that would have made it not just good but great.I will say two more things in the film's favor, though: First, it is a highly faithful rendering of the original short story. The dialog, even certain articles of clothing, were true to Annie Proulx's original vision. A good film doesn't necessarily have to be faithful to its original material (the film adaptations of ""Yentl"" and ""Orlando"" come to mind). But the conscientious fidelity of this film impressed me. There was only one significant deviation from Proulx's story: a certain character with whom Jack gets involved at one point (I'm being vague to avoid spoilers) is a woman in the short story, not a man as in the film. I presume the change was made to simplify Jack's sexuality--a regrettable move but understandable given the contemporary politics of sexuality, which favors clear-cut distinctions between gay and straight. A similar kind of change was made in the film version of E. M. Forster's ""Maurice."" The second, and final, thing I need to say on behalf of this film is something that many others have commented on as well. The film stays with you. For two days afterward, I was in a kind of funk somewhere between sadness and moist-eyed gratitude that I live in a time and place where I can BE with the man I love, thank you God. As a matter of hard-nosed aesthetic criticism, I wish the film could have coupled that ""aftereffect"" with a more powerful in-theater experience. Still, the ""aftereffect"" is an accomplishment.",Brokeback Mountain

568,lamer76,"Brilliant cast, epic love story",9,22 May 2006,"Love is all about the moment, the time spent together, the when and the where. Brokeback Mountain is the setting of that moment, one they could never get back. The rest of their lives is just centered around the memory of Brokeback Mountain, never amounting to much because they got stuck in that time. I'm a sucker for a good gay love story and this film moved me from minute one.Ennis (Ledger) and Jack (Gyllenhaal) are two gay cowboys who fall in love in the summer of 1963 while working as shepherds on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming. Needless to say, their relationship is taboo and they end up leading separate lives, each married and living far apart. They never forget each other and occasionally meet up on ""fishing trips"", desperately trying to recapture the time they had together when they first met. Time takes its toll, and the love they felt becomes a burden on both.With a brilliant cast, this epic love story will affect even those most opposed to homosexuality. It's not about gay love. It's about forbidden love. And it is in this love that Lee was able to merge the beauty of midland America with the beauty of a passion that inevitably turns into pain. You can't help but feel it. I know I did.",Brokeback Mountain
569,Thomasdinnegan75,Thought provoking movie with a message about life,9,29 July 2012,"In honesty, before watching this movie I expected it to be about 2 cowboys who fall in love on a trip and live the rest of their lives together, however that definitely wasn't how it panned out. I kind of like how the film starts when they're 19, and continues through until they're 39, and how a relationship was kept in secret for 20 years even though both, deep down wanted to live their lives together. Ledger's character Ennis is the main of the two, I like how the director focuses on him, as Jake's character Jack isn't all the worried about being gay, and living together, because he loves Ennis, however Ennis as a young kid experienced a horrible ordeal as he saw a gay man who was killed, just because of his sexuality and this puts him off, he doesn't like society and through the whole film, even at the end, he never really reveals too much emotion or talks about his feelings, and I love that the film isn't what I expected, just that the 2 of them fall in love and live happily ever after as that wouldn't have happened in 1963, or in 1989, dare i say, it wouldn't happen today in 2012, i love how the majority of this movie is about Ledger's character Dennis trying to overcome his emotions and feelings, and how although he is gay, he struggles with it, as this too me, is a realistic take on the relationship. Heath and Jake are both great in their roles in this film, they really pull it off together, even though Ledger is the main of the two, i think Jake was better in this movie. I kind of like the ending as once again it is realistic, from the beginning of the movie we see an inward character in Ennis, and although the ending could have been more powerful, I think that it was a good ending, yes, it could have had more emotion, maybe a scene of Ennis scattering Jack's ashes on brokeback, but as i said through the whole film Ennis struggled with emotions and it would have been stupid for him suddenly to change after 20 years of keeping all his emotions in, anyway its clear in the end that he regrets not living with Jack, we can see this when he says to his daughter after she says she is getting married, ""does this boy love you"", and she says ""yeah daddy he does"", and Ennis turns and looks out the window almost crying, this is the most powerful scene as now we finally see someone happy in a relationship, and Ennis realises that he could of had this, with the love of his life, Jack, we can also see that he is going to change and live as he pleases, as Jack always wanted him too but he didn't have the strength, now after 20 years he finally feels the courage to stand up for himself, and he gets this from Jack, this much is obvious to me when he looks at the shirt at the end and says ""Jack, I swear"", he now intends on living his life the way he wants to, although that dark cloud will always hang over him of the life he could of had with Jack, and his heart will always ache from his love for jack, but with the shirt and the picture of brokeback he will be happy, as he says to his daughter when she says ""Daddy you need more furniture"" he replies with ""when you've got nothing,you don't need much"" this implies the little things he has, the shirt and picture, he is happy with that, and it is all his had left, except memories. Even though as I watched this movie I felt awkward at the gay scenes, stupid yeah, but I did, in the end they didn't worry me, as this is a great movie and the hidden message is, be strong have the power to do what you want, not what society expects or thinks is right or wrong, man and woman, man and man or woman and woman if you love someone, you should spend your life with them, as you only live once, so why not live knowing that you are happy with yourself and who you are, rather than living miserably but living normal, this movie isn't just about a gay relationship, its about having the courage to be yourself, to do as you please, to take chances, not just in relationships, but in life, for example travel the world and explore, be happy, as we all, only live once",Brokeback Mountain
570,hallowedgrnd,This much-ballyhooed gay cowboy melodrama is an inert disappointment.,3,25 December 2005,"I saw ""Brokeback Mountain"" & I was 100% disappointed! A complete let down. Not the Best Film of 2005, nor the Worst Film of 2005, just the most over-hyped let-down of a film of 2005! Well, if you miss Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Mountain,"" that's okay  you're not missing much. This much-ballyhooed gay cowboy melodrama is an inert disappointment.All this was, and will ever be is a ""Gay-Film"" made with high end production values, with a B-Cast who couldn't act there way out of a paper bag, with a director who seems he wanted to re-build his reputation after the dud ""The Hulk"", and a studio willing to back his one-sided vision.Adapted from a short story by E. Annie Proulx (whose ""The Shipping News"" also made for a hugely disappointing movie), Lee's film stretches the story over the course of decades to beyond its breaking point.""Brokeback Mountain"" was the type of film made for the straight, art-house crowd, who only could probably handle a gay male (or anything gay for that matter as long as they didn't have to see it for real), or gay sex on the big screen, or in such small ways as ""Will & Grace"" that if it was actually placed in front of them in real life, these same so called open-mined people would freak out.Hailed as a landmark of mainstream tolerance (and to the ""mainstream""'s shame, that's exactly what it is), ""Brokeback Mountain"" feels more like an antiseptic gimmick that attempts to hijack the conventions of a traditionally-masculinized genre to further demonstrate, as if further demonstration were needed, that two men in love is as natural, tempestuous, and ineffable as heterosexuality. The obstacles thrown their way are hazarded at but ultimately poorly-drawn--in fact, there are arguably more opportunities for Jack and Ennis to have a gay relationship than there are scenes of hate and bigotry. Kudos, I guess, for presenting homosexual characters neither mincing nor particularly good at dressing and decorating, though one does get a little tired of the single-dimensions in which the female satellites and their problems are sketched.There was no ""real"" so-called ""Love"" relationship in this film. These two cowboys got drunk and had sex on top of a mountain for what one summer, & then what met every two to four years to do it over and over and over. Man if this is what Ang Lee calls a relationship, I would hate to see what he calls a ""F&%K Buddy""! Guys who get drunk and have sex is not love! I feel like the problem is that Lee's passion for this project is several degrees cooler than his cast's--like he's looking for a place to stretch out and relax (as indicated by the sloppy editing and laggard pacing & several goofs involving Jake Gyllenhaal's mustache) while everyone else is painting in swaths of passion, desperation, and regret, or even if you want to call it that.Ledger and Williams are not that amazing as critics & all the awards that they have collected will lead you to believe. None of the cast bring enough to the table between any of them to suggest what the film might have been--and to make ""Brokeback Mountain"" worth the look.As my partner stated the characters were nothing but cardboard, and we couldn't care about them or there lives as the story went along. As one critic pointed out, & I 100% agree: ""Of course, these criticisms fly in the face of popular opinion; ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a booby-trapped film, designed to appear like an Oscar winner, and to be viewed without question. It's infuriating that three other, much braver gay-themed films from earlier this year, ""Transamerica"", ""Mysterious Skin"" and ""Capote"", won't merit a fraction of the attention lavished upon Lee's timid effort. And gay audiences who have patiently waited for their epic romantic masterpiece will have to wait still longer"".THE WORST MOMENT: If U seen the trailer, the ending is so predictable that anybody could see it coming from miles away, that once you see the film you go who cares. I won't spoil it for those who haven't see the movie, but trust me I wasn't that moved, except when the credits rolled & I could leave the theater. I may be gay, but I didn't love this film, this to me wasn't a ""gay"" love story, it was more of a Cowboy ""lust"" picture with a low end production values, a really bad B cast and a film that felt like it went on forever & ever & ever. I hate to say it one more time, but gay audiences (like me) who have patiently waited for their epic romantic masterpiece will have to wait still longer.",Brokeback Mountain
571,zephyr24-1,The Cold Harsh Mountain,9,18 February 2006,"Brokeback Mountain Directed by Lee Ang Screenplay adapted by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana Based on the short story by Annie ProulxStarring Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Anne Hathaway & Michelle WilliamsHaving read the original short story by Proulx a few years ago, I was surprised by how well a tale of love between two cowboys set against a panoramic Wyoming backdrop was told. When I learned that the 60-page short story would become a film directed by celebrated director Lee Ang, I hoped it would be made soon.By now, most people would have associated Brokeback Mountain with gay forbidden love. The truth is, Brokeback Mountain is just a very simple tale of arduous love and anyone with an ounce of emotion should watch.The union of director Lee Ang, scriptwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, and the cast results in one of the most exquisite and endearing films made in the last few years.Lee Ang possesses the talent for slow, intricate and subtle film direction. He pays attention to almost every aspect from simple small gestures to complex emotional strife set against the magnificent mountain view.McMurtry and Ossana also adapted the story faithfully except for the fact that the two male leads were originally much less desirable than Ledger and Gyllenhaal with bucked-tooth and stocky bodies.The assembled cast is the third link which leads the film to flight. Heath Ledger, the stoic straight-man type is caught unexpectedly in a tangled web of emotions for a fellow cowboy, something that had never crossed his less-than-queer mind. A man of few words, Ledger plays Ennis to perfection when he displays the inner turmoil that Ennis encountered trying to live his life the way it is and learning to love Jack. Every time Ledger breaks down and cries in the film, it's when you'll feel him.Jake Gyllenhaal is the hopeful companion who prays for the day that the union could yield the type of permanence he so craved for instead of ""one or two of high-altitude f**ks once or twice in a year."" And he waited for 20 years until the audience shares his anguish and unfulfilled yearnings by the time he lashed out on what they ever have left is Brokeback Mountain.Michelle Williams plays the silent, long-suffering wife who witnessed the earth-shattering and ultimately heartbreaking kiss shared between Ennis and Jack after 4 years of separation. Williams is exceptionally sorrowful, swallowing her unspoken hurt until she could hold it no more that she wanted to hear the truth out of Ennis' mouth years after her remarriage. Williams' acting prowess is certainly validated by the expression she showed at the instance of that unexpected kiss and the heart-wrenching exchange with Ledger.Anne Hathaway plays a rich girl whose expertise is in making money not relationships. Given her short screen time, her change from a brash rich girl to a high-society career woman and finally a emotionless and grieving widow expands her acting abilities beyond her impish Princess Diary-self.Many unions, liaisons and break-ups later, Brokeback Mountain emerges as a tragic yet bittersweet and endearing tale of love between four suffering people afflicted with varying degrees of attachment but all not willing to let go. To me, this suffices as more than a gay cowboy story. To enjoy Brokeback Mountain, an open mind and eyes are definitely pre-requisites. (A+)",Brokeback Mountain
572,dc_follies,"Not a good script, which is a damn shame.",5,23 January 2006,"My viewing of Brokeback Mountain admittedly suffered from the hype surrounding the movie. Throw the Golden Globe for Best Drama on top of the other critical acclaim and you have the makings for a tremendous movie, right? Brokeback Mountain, as everyone knows by now, surrounds the relationship of two cowboys from the time they meet forward for twenty years. Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) and Jack Twist (Gyllenhall) meet when they take a ranching job in the mountains of Wyoming. Their relationship develops slowly with neither character saying much to the other. At one point, Del Mar says about three lines of dialog and that is followed by a comment from Twist ""that's more than you've said in the past two weeks"" to which Del Mar responds ""friend, that's more than I've said in a year."" Therein lies the problem with Brokeback Mountain. There really isn't anything thrown to the viewer to give you a reason to believe the relationship between the two cowboys. There isn't a shared past or a deep, meaningful conversation about anything or even loneliness. It is really difficult to believe that any of the characters really care about each other. By the time Del Mar and Twist separate after their initial encounter, it is downright impossible to sense any sort of chemistry or feelings between the two. The next time they meet, its as though they were war buddies reunited after 25 years. It just doesn't work. The main problem with the film is that this is one of the worst scripts in recent memory. The movie jumped in time after short scenes with little dialog or development, sometimes as much as ten years. It is a shame that this was so poorly written because the acting is outstanding, the direction was good and the scenery fantastic. All of that can't save a terribly written and developed story. I don't believe that this movie would have received all of its accolades if this script was about a straight couple - the relationships between all of the characters wasn't good enough to make the movie meaningful. I rarely agree with the Top 1000 voters, but do in this case.",Brokeback Mountain

The first half is flawless and gay or straight I can't imagine anyone not feeling for these guys. How the relationship is established seems so organic, not forced or part of some heavy handed ""message"" as so many other films dealing with issues like this are. On a side note many of the early scenes culminating with the first sexual scene can be pretty funny if you imagine a person unaware of the plot watching it. Imagining the reaction from a viewer watching it cold is pretty funny. Sort of like the kiss in Deathtrap multiplied by 10.I have no problem with the nature of the film and truly admire much of it... but why did it feel the need to denigrate children? Ennis dealing with children that never stopped screaming? Um, children may often be a pain but the way they are presented in this film is creepy. Screeching monsters that are beasts sucking the life out of the parents? What the hell is that about? That aspect actually seems to support a stereotype about gays. Jack hooking up with a Tomboy girl that suddenly becomes some cold methodical shrew? Some of this just seems arbitrary and at the service of the plot.Were Homosexuals really being murdered in the U.S. to the point that this plot would make sense? The U.S. has problems (as every society does) but it's not like Iran where gays are killed on sight and hanged by the government. There was no reason that Jack and Ennis couldn't hook up after Ennis' divorce and find a way to be together.While the tragic nature of the film is heart breaking I cant help but feel the film forced the events leading to the tragic end.

The actors are all really good; the death of Heath Ledger is a big loss for the world of acting. He did an excellent job as the reticent Ennis and he proves himself as a great actor. Jake Gyllenhaal is very good as well. The beautiful landscapes of the Canadian Rockies in Southern Alberta are amazing to see, and there are a lot of moving moments in this film.

The story itself is pure baloney where two cowboys in need of affection (sex) decide to do it like any dog would copulate, with an other one, on the spur of the moment.

577,jansen-aui,Powerful and poignant. I wish it knew how to quit haunting my thoughts,10,20 June 2006,"""If you can't fix it, Jack, you gotta stand it""So goes the adage that Brokeback Mountain's tragic central character, Ennis del Mar (Heath Ledger), lives by. In the summer of '63, two aspiring ranch hands with little to no prospects find themselves work herding sheep upon picturesque Brokeback Mountain. It is a place of desperate loneliness, and as much to their surprise as ours, the two men form a connection over that summer that develops to a lifelong relationship. ""Brokeback got us good,"" remarks Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal), during their first reunion that occurs only after four years of longing have passed since the day he and Ennis bade each other gut-wrenching goodbyes. By this time, both men have moved on and married: Ennis to his sweetheart Alma Beers (Michelle Williams) and Jack to rodeo queen Lureen Newsome (Anne Hathaway). They are marriages more of convenience that anything else  society would never, ever accept a relationship such as the one they share in secret. Ennis knows this better than any other, having been forced by his father at the tender age of nine to look upon the dried up corpse of a man beaten to death by tire iron when it became common knowledge he was living with another man. Over the next twenty years, we watch as Ennis and Jack retreat for fishing trips on Brokeback Mountain, where little fishing is done and where Ennis discovers that he is never as fulfilled as when he's in the company of Jack Twist, drinking whiskey under the moonlight. Despite any romantic ideas Jack might have that the two could settle down together, Ennis, scarred by his experience as a boy, repeatedly pushes Jack away so as to deny himself the happiness of being with the one person he truly, deeply loves. By the time the film closes, you cannot help but feel your heart has been ripped out of your chest: raw, same as Ennis.With Brokeback Mountain, all the aspects of film-making combine coherently to paint a visual expression of Annie Proulx's sparse prose under Ang Lee's delicate, consummate guidance. Writers Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana don't just adapt the 30-page short story; they expand upon it to fill a two-hour feature, by adding crucial moments that flesh out character and underline drama. Against a backdrop of Rodrigo Prieto's picture-perfect cinematography and Gustavo Santaolalla's emotive, expressive score, the young cast impresses. Gyllenhaal's frustration is palpable, Williams' devastation is incredibly powerful and sympathetic, but the phenomenon here is Heath Ledger: all clenched fist and clenched mouth. It's such an impossibility for him to express emotion that when he does, with his final promise to Jack, it breaks your heart.After leaving the cinema screening of Brokeback Mountain, I was haunted for weeks by its emotional resonance. Upon a second viewing on DVD, it elicits an even greater reaction. I simply cannot comprehend how, as Ang Lee's obvious masterpiece and what has developed into the most acclaimed film in motion picture history, the Academy could fail to honour this touching, tragic, universally powerful story that carries with it  but never preaches  an important message about love it's own Best Picture statue.

I was sympathetic to the movie's message about the hatred and violence that homosexual love for some reason triggers in so many people, but I was expecting a greater, a more inspired, love story. Scenery was nice, but the story itself dragged . . and dragged . . . and dragged. Half way through the story and I was glancing at my watch. I would have left actually if I had been there by myself.

(The couple we were with agreed.) We see a lot of movies and we've seen some great performances this year. This wasn't even close to being one of them. The question I have to ask is ""If this love story was NOT about gay lovers, how would it rate as a movie and love story?"" The answer is ""poor."" And that's what makes me think this is a great movie for people who have a particular interest in the subject matter, but not a great movie for other people.",Brokeback Mountain
580,ironman817,Same Time Next Year Meets Sheep-herding,5,21 March 2006,"Bless the academy for ignoring the political hype and rewarding the superior film - Crash. Brokeback is just a gay version of Same Time Next Year except that movie grew the relationship and the people changed and actually had conversations. It was a richer version of the story that I frankly liked better. Guess Who's Coming To Dinner was considered courageous and ground-breaking but who remembers it today or puts it on a list of great movies. Brokeback's first 45 minutes are a bore of sheep herding and eating beans and nice scenery. This is a movie where a life long love is unjustified by anything we see or hear on screen. What holds these men together besides lust? Who knows? It is a shame there was no way to make Angels in America a theatrical release because there is a far better written film with a real wow factor. It is not hard to believe that Brokeback came from a short story because there is very little story, very few great scenes (although the great ones are great) and a lot of padding. A good movie - yes. An Oscar winner - NO! Of course criticizing this film is not permitted amongst those who seem to believe that a liberal challenge to conservative bigotry should should win Oscars instead of writing and acting. Now that the movie has lost the Oscar it may be remembered at least for that.",Brokeback Mountain
581,BeerFairy100,Simply fantastic!,8,18 March 2010,"When a lot of people hear the title of the movie. They just assume ""Oh, the movie with the gay cowboys who just make out?"" Although, I think it's way more then that.I've enjoyed many things about this movie. Like for instance, the acting, and the intense love scenes between Jack and Ennis. This movie also sends out a clear message about repressed homosexuality, about how hard it is on yourself to just hide it, and pretend your not. It's also very accurate about how people felt about, these kinds of subjects at the time (even though I didn't like it one bit, it happened).What I didn't like about this movie was the ending, I'm not too big on sad endings. I did not agree with having Jack Twist dying at the end. Although, I guess it was another way of showing what would happen if people knew you were gay during the time of the setting. It was a bit of a tear-jerker for me.Overall, I'm giving this an 8 out of ten.",Brokeback Mountain
582,queerever,Forget DeNiro Pacino,10,4 August 2010,"People are so ridiculously sentimental. De Niro, Pacino, my bum. Dinosaurs. Ugly, macho monochrome actors who always seem exactly like themselves. Maybe they were great for their relatively, very uncompetitive, film age, but they don't come anywhere near Ledger and Gyllenhaal. I was shocked when I watched this the 3rd time and realised it was 2h 15mins, or thereabouts. The other times I watched it, it flew by so fast that I had thought it was a film of about 90 - 100 mins. at most. The absolute opposite of most other films. Even some great films drag. This one no, and why. Well, they must be truly great actors. Films have their value for so many different reasons; I am also not a fan of actors - I believe that writers and Directors deserve far more of the credit for making a beautiful work of art. However these 2 men, if you can take away your Homophobia and not even see it as gay, made the greatest romance of all time happen on screen. This is the most compelling 2 performances and tragic, romantic love story ever told. And the scenery helped of course.",Brokeback Mountain
583,jpseacadets,A revelation about human love.,10,9 February 2006,"They told me this was a movie about gay cowboys. The ads for it read ""Love is a force of nature."" How confusing, I thought. So I went not knowing what to expect. First thing that struck me was how quiet the audience was....man, what silence. The actors looked pretty tough and rugged, like they always did in westerns. Then came the tent scene ...and right there it hit me with a wallop. Man, I don't think I've been this glued to the screen in years. The first thing I felt was how the West could never be quite the same anymore. The next was my amazement in how they got two such tough guys to portray sensitivity the way they did. The answer had to be director Ang Lee with such an expressive Americana I have not seen since George Stevens' time. What a craftsman. Another answer lies with the two stars. Jake Gyllenhaal and his doe-like eyes filled with devotion. So vulnerable and such human vulnerability. But if a masterful director and a congenial, gifted actor weren't enough - - and these are plenty - - my greatest impression from the movie is Heath Ledger. What a treasure trove of talent! He is simply amazing. A repertoire of voice, walk, gesture, glance, grunting... and he breaks your heart with them. His portrayal of a lovesick cowboy is unforgettable. He just grows and grows on you! Not since James Dean or Monty Clift has there been one like he. Playing a man of few words who handles his quiet moments on screen with sledge- hammer effect. But I'm straying from the story. Because for all their strengths and toughness, life throws them a curve-ball. I wish I could tell you more without giving the movie away. Suffice it to say that one of the men must struggle with his inner demons, a struggle so fraught with pain that it exacts a heavy toll not only on them, but delivers much collateral damage to the women in their lives. They too suffer over some things that are no fault of theirs. But it's the men, Ennis and Jack, who endure the most misery, a misery that cannot even be articulated by either man due to their isolation; neither afford to say the words ""I love you"" to each other. This happens because these are the rules society has made for them. Cowboys, especially. It's drilled into us from when we're little boys that a man can't have a romantic interest in another man. Even for lonesome drifters.After witnessing these hardships and struggles most Americans know so little about, I leave the theater and go home, not in the mood to go shopping. I thought of myself as a kid wearing my cowboy hat, holster, and six gun, and how I realize my view of cowboys will be forever changed because of this movie. I even wondered what Randolph Scott, my favorite cowboy star, would feel about Ennis and Jack riding along the Chisolm trail with him? You've come a long way, Randy! Let me finish by telling everyone they have nothing to fear from this movie. They do only if human love is fearful to them. If they forget that love is truly one of nature's forces...and a transcending one. BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a momentous movie I tell my friends. Especially when viewed more with the heart than with the eyes. It's a pivotal event in American cinema.",Brokeback Mountain

585,bjorkpluto,Brokeback Mountain Is A Good Movie But Not Great,6,3 January 2006,"For all of the hype for Brokeback Mountain I was surprised at the misogyny of the director Ang Lee. It seems to me Focus Features, Lee and the main actors are trying to make this movie something it is not. I am glad some posts have called the film lame in the aspect of the intimacy. I was surprised the lack of physical intimacy between Ledger and Gyllenhaal. How is it groundbreaking that in the third act of the film..the viewer still doesn't sense that Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar are in love? Why is Lee cloaking the same sex intimacy in the film? If the film is supposed to be groundbreaking shouldn't there be more showing and less implying? The performances were great though all around. I was most impressed with Anne Hathaway even though Michelle Williams of course was amazing as well. However, Lee did not explain enough by SHOWING the viewer why Lureen and Jack's marriage broke down? I understand that Jack and Lureen's marriage was the more secondary marriage...but there wasn't enough background information into their relationship..that's my main problem with the movie. The middle of the film was boring and it dragged a bit...There wasn't enough EXPLAINING and SHOWING the viewers or building up to the conflicts that are dealt head on in the third act of the movie after Ennis divorce.This is the third movie I have seen of Lee where a young actress must show her breasts. There was absolutely no reason why Anne Hathaway had to expose herself in this film. I thought this movie was supposed to be about homosexuals? So why is there more sex scenes between Ledger and Williams and Gyllenhaal and Hathaway? And why was Michelle Williams also exposed? Seems like Lee just likes to see young actresses naked or something. Some male directors are so sexist its disgusting. The film overall gets a 6.5 out of 10. The critics are seriously delusional here. The middle of the movie..should of EXPLAINED MORE...SHOW MORE..TELL MORE...",Brokeback Mountain
586,Different_Voices,I am *not* homophobic but...,4,7 August 2006,"Its very hard to critique movies that everyone else seems to love, especially if they deal with controversial themes. I for one, did not like Brokeback Mountain at all. Of course, as soon as I say this everyone naturally assumes I'm a homophobe. This is entirely unfair. For years I've been a huge fan of Pedro Almodovar and Gus Van Sant. Both directors have dealt with homosexual themes years before Heath Ledger, Jake Gylenhaal and Ang Lee ever even set up their first shot. My Own Private Idaho deals again with the theme of homosexuality and is far superior to Brokeback for a number of reasons. For a start, I think its hard to see any love at all between the movie's two central protagonists Jack and Ennis. The very fact that two heart-throbs were cast as homosexual lovers makes me think that maybe they were more attracted to each other's body than anything else. Also there is really no connection between the two leads before they first have sexual intercourse. The two seem to be in lust, not love. The fact that Jack goes to visit a Mexican hooker in order to fulfill his desires seems to suggest he's really only addicted to sex. He doesn't need Ennis; he just needs anyone to relieve his sexual longing.Then again maybe the movie just didn't strike a chord with me personally. The ending which many found tragic (a woman sitting next to me was crying so hard she actually had to leave the cinema) left me cold. I didn't respond to the characters at all. The direction I found rather flat: the landscape seemed to do all the work for Ang Lee. He was just very lucky with where he set up all his shots.So in conclusion please do not label me as homophobic. Is it wrong to dislike a film because it deals with gay characters? Does that mean that any movie, no matter how terrible that contains the theme of homosexuality should be left uncritiqued?",Brokeback Mountain
587,johnm-38132,Majestic gay epic!!,9,28 January 2017,"Part of the major appeal to this movie is the majestic setting, the rugged mountains and wilderness. This played a defining role in the first part of the movie, when the central characters established their lifelong bond. The other appeal were the two fine actors who played the gay cowboys. I was drawn most to Jake, the dark haired, blue eyed, baby faced actor. Whenever the camera lit upon his eyes and face, it was easy to fall in love. Both actors depicted masculine, young, impoverished, rural men who were trying to find ways to eek out a living. They smoked a lot, ate a lot of beans and drank moonshine in their coffee. On camera, they did everything typical cowboys might do except burp and fart incessantly. I suppose underneath it all, they were true gentlemen. The director did a good job at convincing the viewer that these men were indeed gay, but were forced to assume a straight lifestyle due to immense societal pressure. Bisexual men, for instance, in those circumstances, probably would never have kissed so tenderly or established the lifelong intense bond these characters had. If it's just about sexual release or getting off, kissing and longevity are the first to be dismissed. In any case, the ending was somewhat disappointing because Ennis never evolved. He never overcame his paralysis about being gay and in love with another man. He was going to live ashamed and concealed for the rest of his life - this, despite it being the early 1980s, when gay culture had already evolved substantially.",Brokeback Mountain
588,kartiknnagar,"A tragic and melancholic, but beautiful and tender forbidden romance",8,19 November 2017,"In many ways, this is a very typical love story : a forbidden romance, bowing down to the rules and needs of the society, the resulting sorrow, ruining more lives in the process with betrayal, a desperate attempt to cling to traces of the romance, just leading to more heartbreak and an unfulfilling life. As can be inferred from the summary, this is a sad movie, but it is also beautifully shot, full of scenes with natural beauty and soothing calm, interspersed with moments of passion which nonetheless mellow out with gentle love and tender care as time passes and the characters grow older. What truly shines though is the brilliant acting performances, especially by Heath Ledger who truly sells a very conflicted and broken soul, torn between love, duty and fear.",Brokeback Mountain

Watching Jake and Heath I almost forgot I was watching two Hollywood A lister heterosexuals and it was like watching a real love story but the people didn't know they were being filmed. Heath in particular was just so incredible and you could see the torment his character was going through with the pain flowing through his eyes. You soon forget you're watching a ""gay love story"" and it's just two people falling in love despite themselves. I don't think anyone could have acted it as wonderfully as Jake and Heath did. It was Heath who really made this film for me because his character actually didn't have that many lines yet he told the story of every scene through his face and body language and when it came to the sad end it was almost too painful to keep watching. It was just an amazing film with a beautiful but tragic love story and the ending left me proper sobbing with real ugly crying because I knew that a lot of gay relationships didn't get happy endings at this time and it just reminded me how far we have come and how unfair and cruel life was for people who's only crime was loving someone.

I'm a reader of the thousands of online stories that depict homosexual love and sex in a well-written, tasteful and non-exploitive manner. (Yes, anything and everything flourishes on the Internet, it seems, even good writing by amateurs.) So my reaction to ""Brokeback"" was . . . it's kind of tame. I guess I should have expected that from the first major Hollywood movie to actually show gay sex. I'm REALLY glad the movie was made and that it's done so well, because homophobia still ruins lives and it's the stupidest thing in the world.

Some pretty scenery, some great photography capturing the cold loneliness of rural Wyoming, but a dreary death march to the ending.

594,redkamp-2,This film has haunted me ever since I saw it last night.,10,8 December 2005,"I was fortunate to see it at an invitational preview in a full auditorium. Everyone I was with sat spellbound throughout its entire 134 minute running time. We did not find the film to be too long at all. It would be pretty hard to condense twenty years into a shorter 90 minute film. It could have been even longer than 134 minutes so far as I'm concerned.The acting was perfection. Much has been said about Heath Ledger and his superb performance. I can't imagine anyone portraying Ennis with more subtlety or feeling. Jake Gyllenhaal has a flashier part which could have been a travesty in lesser hands, but Jake could not have been better as the soulful Jack. Both Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway are great as the wives who never achieve true love from these two conflicted men. All of the lesser parts are in good hands and Randy Quaid, in a small role, stands out as the gruff ranch boss.Not to be overlooked is the gorgeous cinematography, the sweeping vistas of the plains and mountains and the beautiful music score. And, of course, Ang Lee's masterful direction.Finally (a possible spoiler), the sad finale, where Ennis visits Jack's parents, contains the most poignant and achingly romantic scene I've witnessed on screen in a longtime. It's when Ennis finds their old shirts in Jack's boyhood bedroom closet and hugs them through his tears. I think that scene has haunted me today more than any other part of that magnificent film.Without hesitation, I give it a 10/10.",Brokeback Mountain
595,diva-19,Of Lovers And Longings,10,17 December 2005,"An excellent film about love. Every character is spot on. Excellent acting, though both leads are award winning. Both should hopefully receive nominations. Despite the film taking place in 1963 - 1983, it is also sorrowfully current. It is an important film for its subtle power. Though not preachy, it will have an important place in film history. The first part of the film is beautiful in its rustic beauty. Terrific cinematography. Mountains, rushing rivers, herds of sheep - innocence?Here it is on the mountain's slopes that the love of these mens' lives starts. There will never be anyone else. It is simple here, uncomplicated - a part of nature and natural. The physical is more violent than erotic or perhaps that is the eroticism. The sex scenes are hardly ground breaking and should not upset many. Not graphic unlike some reports. When these lovers do descend from the mountain and away from nature, is when their troubles and frustrations start. Absolutely no one fares well in this film. By the end most of the lives portrayed have been shattered. It is all extremely sad and honestly depressing on so many levels, but it is superb and a must see. A pretty safe bet as a very serious contender for ""Best Picture"" in all of the awards still to come. Commendations to Ang Lee for his languorous, perfectly paced direction and for making this film at all. It too must have been a test of endurance, which will ultimately benefit all.",Brokeback Mountain
596,kaleidoscope_eyess,"""Gay Cowboy Movie""",9,20 July 2019,"The essence of Brokeback Mountain is wholly grasped within the teasing meme ""gay cowboy movie."" Brokeback Mountain is about the clashes between two worlds. At the first sight, Brokeback Mountain seems so western with its sceneries, costumes designs, music scores, vernaculars, etc. Tensions instantly surface when Ennis and Jack, two masculine high school dropouts from Wyoming, reveal their feelings towards each other. Brokeback Mountain stands out as a continuation of the western tradition and a bold deconstruction of every element western movies once possessed. Ennis, whose life path has been completed deviated for the sake of Jack, could have lived a happy life with his wife, daughters and hourly jobs. In fact, he attaches to his philosophy of life all the time, silently supporting his own family with his hard work. While Ennis never doubts the idea of nuclear family, Jack has envisioned a bold solution: to move to a ranch and live together henceforth. Hence it can be derived that neither of them actually has imagined another way of living, i.e., to move to Los Angeles, New York City, Chicago, etc., and to start a brand new life. After all, the mountains and country life are what they grow up getting used to and what define their core identities as distinct individuals.The tragedy of Brokeback Mountain lies in the inherent incompatibility between the old world and the new world. In this sense, Ennis and Jack face the dilemma a Norwegian woman Nora used to face. In the closing of A Doll House, Nora is such a woken woman who seeks a new livelihood in a male-dominated world. But Ennis and Jack lack both revolutionary qualities and fearless spirit of Nora. They even do not possess a proper term to define their sexuality. Without higher education and contact with the outer world, Ennis and Jack become two wandering ghosts unsure about their fates.Strangely, no one knows better about the feeling of dis-belonging than the director Ang Lee himself, an East Asian migrant squeezing himself into Hollywood. Eventually, Brokeback Mountain is a love letter to all the ""outsiders"" struggling to fit into either world. The question posed in this movie is about human condition that lingers and will never fade away.",Brokeback Mountain
597,cj_685,Appreciate this film before you comment!,10,20 August 2006,"Wow! The arguing that goes on in here is so amusing! Anyway, I thought this film was really good and despite a few things I would've liked to have seen expanded on I'm happy to give this full marks! Movies of this genre don't usually move me in the way that this did! Unfortunately, I felt it was ashame that the story doesn't involve more about Jack and Ennis' relationship together, but then the main issue IS the fact that their love was a love that cannot be! The romantic scenes between Gyllenhaal and Ledger were, i thought, displayed extremely well and really did back-up what you were meant to believe (that the two men were actually in love)! However, i did think that the initial sexual interaction seemed to me to be a little odd! I do though, think that this is just because that scene is based around pure animal magnetism and not any means of love unlike the later interactions! The passion in the scene where the wife, played by Williams, sees the lovers embrace at the side of the house is perfect, and is handled brilliantly by the two actors! I think the reason why this film is appreciated in the way it is by so many people is that it is a beautiful and captivating story, which is supported by many pivotal moments of great acting! These moments touched me and thats therefore why I am giving 'Brokeback Mountain' the rating I am! I hope this helps",Brokeback Mountain
598,gordem1,"Yuck, maybe I am homophobic",2,23 January 2007,"OK, I'll admit it, I am one of the dreaded straights who has seen this movie. My wife said, ""Gord, trust me, you won't like it!"" and I wanted to prove her wrong. I see myself as a sensitive, caring, kind and generous football type.(or in days gone by....a real cowboy) I also thought I had come to totally accept that there were guys who preferred guys but I have found that this observation is somewhat qualified. I can accept it as long as it's tacit and kept in the bedroom. When it's waved in front of me I tend to gag. It's like watching someone pick his nose and eat the catch. I was proud of myself, curled up on the sofa and enjoying the Alberta scenery......and the acting of 2 burly, good-looking guys doing range work. I might have been alright if they had just embraced and left the rest to my imagination but when they started poking around each other's body trying to make entrances out of exits, I chucked my popcorn.It grieves me that in so few years, perhaps since the 70's, as a society we have been forced to accept that homosexual activity is perfectly normal and acceptable. At the risk of being politically incorrect, we now must endorse a way of life that is at cross-purposes with nature. I have to explain to my pre-teen that the mostly naked guy at the gay-pride parade who is rubbing his hand all over another guy's posterior is just being ""caring"". Even worse, I had to explain that the 2 guys in the movie, who are portrayed as perfectly normal, diligent workers, are not just breathing hard from work.It's difficult for me to weigh in on this film for its artistic value when I see it as exploitation, not art.

599,HollywoodAlicia,Touching...,9,21 May 2013,"Brokeback Mountain is such a touching movie, it will leave you in tears. People cliché it as a ""gay cowboy movie"", but it's so much more than that. What is so great about Brokeback Mountain, is that love like this is happening all over the world, but there has never been a movie that represents that love, so I think it was extremely brave of Ang Lee to do this.Jake Gyllenhaal took the spotlight as Jack Twist, or ""Jack Nasty"". (Only fans will get that one!) Jake's acting was off the charts, I can't even describe it. You could see his passion and his struggles; so bravo to him. Heath Ledger played Ennis Del Mar. I think for the character he did a great job, but the clenched-jaw thing began to annoy me halfway through (not to mention, you could here his Austrailian accent poke through a couple of times, but all great actors struggle with concealing accents); but his character is supposed to be a tight, clenched person so it worked very well. Anne Hathaway well she's always amazing; and Michelle Williams played the role of scared wife well.",Brokeback Mountain
600,Moviemaniacgirl-1,Shattering,10,25 February 2012,"If you are reading my review it means you were curious or considered watching Brokeback Mountain. I understand that the first phrase that comes to mind when you hear the title is ""Gay-Cowboy Movie."" Don't worry I thought that, too. At one point in your life you have to give up all pretenses and enjoy what you want to.I saw this because I knew that Heath Ledger wouldn't do something unless it had depth too it, no matter how deep or shallow the depth was. Don't turn away now. You have taken the time to find out about this movie, and you should. This movie is one of the most inspirational love stories I've ever seen. To tell the truth, it is the best love story I have ever watched, ever. Ang Lee has a special technique that adds to the focus of a film. In ""Brokeback Mountain"" his visionary method takes the movie to outstanding places. Through the mountains, and terrain he includes in almost every shot he shows how vast the love is, how vast the hatred is, and how vast every humans emotion can be. I like to look at the shots one by one and immense myself in the fact that there is so much to everything, there is almost too much. Lee takes every shot of the movie and makes it full to the brim, you have to look fast because each shot is gone so quickly, but is worth the look. Lee does a tasteful job filming the scenes that have branded this movie ""Gay"". If you think this is the ""gay-cowboy movie"" then watch what he does, and you will realize how he shows just enough, and not too much.He allows the relations to be seen, but not to force them down your throat. Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar was my absolute favorite part of ""Brokeback Mountain"". Some actors have a specific way about them, you can feel their soul. Ledger has a tangible soul and every moment that he is on screen you are feeling his pain, his love, his anger, and it allows you to BE him, not just see him. The character is silent, therefore must speak with is body and facial expressions, and I can't imagine anyone could do it better than Heath Ledger. His eyes themselves express every bit of passion Ennis Del Mar has. If for nothing else, watch Brokeback Mountain for Heath Ledger's stunning and beautiful performance that will surely go down in history. Jake Gyllenhaal left me speechless. I've never really liked him as an actor outside of Donnie Darko and Zodiac, but he surprised me by being so amazing. Jake had a love and a heart that was wide open. There are certain actors that fit the role, even if they are nothing like the character, they just fit. Jake Gyllenhaal fits Jack Twist like they'd known each other for years, and were old friends who knew each other inside and out. To understand what sacrifice is, you have to watch the tortured expressions Gyllenhaal is capable of. Bravo, and thank you Jake for surprising me. Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams served very similar purposes in the movie, and both served them well. I'm not going to rave on and on about how fabulous both actresses were, because in comparison to the male leads, they weren't. But, both had their own spark and their own stage presence that added to the film. Watching women struggle with a realization like the one in this film is fascinating. Don't take my comments on them as the two being bad, they just couldn't compare to the excellence and pure perfection of Ledger and Gyllenhaal. I've read the short story that this movie was adapted from. The short story is of the same name and carries the same power. When I read I see a movie going through my head following, so it is important that the author gives character and place description. Wow. Brokeback Mountain was truly an amazing read. it barely took thirty minutes and I had read it twice. Once you begin the journey of reading it, you can't stop. Every character, moment and feeling enveloped me. I can't stop thinking about everything and how amazingly adapted this film was. Reading then watching, watching then reading, either way you know the story inside and out. The short story and the movie almost mirrored each other. The only major difference was Michelle Williams' role. In the story it was featured less, but in the movie you got a chance to understand how the women fit in. Perfectly adapted. There isn't much else to say, besides this: Every once and a while you find a movie that touches you in a way that is unimaginable. Brokeback Mountain touched me so powerfully that I couldn't control my crying for twenty minutes after it ended. I cry every time I watch it, and every time I think about it, but after I cry I can feel something new and momentous. Something about love and about people. There is nothing more moving and powerful than the entirety of this heart-felt and soul- wrenching film.",Brokeback Mountain
601,jacktreese1,Unexpectedly captivating,6,7 January 2006,"Brokeback Mountain finally premiered in Rochester last night. Before I continue, I just want to say that before I walked into the theater, my conscience was saying not to go, because of my past view on homosexuality. My idea was that it was wrong and immoral.However, I still cleared my mind and gave myself the strength to pay attention. And I'm glad I did.'Cause I wasn't watching another gay-biased film. I wasn't even watching a new work that Ang Lee put out just to say he did something. No, I was watching an engaging, emotional, heart-felt romantic drama. Just with homosexual characters instead of the typical male-female romance.Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar deserves not only an Oscar nod, but a win as well. Jake Gyllenhaal was also good as Jack Twist.In the end, I learned that homosexuality should be tolerated, and that it's their own choice and no one else's.ACTING: 10 WRITING: 10 DIRECTION: 10 MUSIC: 10 OVERALL: 10",Brokeback Mountain

But never the less : This is one of the best Movies I've seen in a long time, and sensitized me for homosexuality and their ban and exclusion from society.Heath Ledger played his role overwhelming brilliant - all the time I had no doubt that his characteristic in reality would be the same as in the movie. His acting felt so real, this guy, who hasn't overcome his past and lives in seclusion - also mentally. Who fell in love but hast not yet decided if he'd fight society and their anti-homosexual tendencies and let go and feel with all thats inside of him or become conventional and denies his uprising feelings to another man.How sad he died a couple of years after the movie. Heath Ledger - rest in peace, with this milestone of movie you became immortal!",Brokeback Mountain
603,invisibleman-1,Moving,10,22 October 2006,"The one and only reason to watch a movie is to being moved. To be moved out of your own reality into the reality of the characters but then again feeling strong resonance with your own life subconsciously. Brokeback Mountain is such a movie which touches the most hurting wounds in our lives: the wounds caused by missing a chance, by missing an opportunity to walk another path. These wounds hurt the most when the only reason to not have chosen the other path is our own fear. Fear is such a destructive emotion and mostly an amalgam of our childhood experiences, education and socialization. On the other hand, love can also be destructive but the combination of both as we see in BBM is truly tragic.While Ennis is the fearsome guy it's Jack who always believes and hopes that one day their love will be stronger than Ennis' fears. But Ennis doesn't make a decision until it's too late.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal play these two characters and their love for each other in such a believable way that we are deeply touched. Yes, it is only a movie ... but we all know that must be many stories out there like the one between Ennis and Jack.Ang Lee did a fantastic job here. He created a true epic, with epic landscapes, epic emotions and an epic time line. On the other hand BBM is a very intimate movie watching closely the expressions of the protagonists. The music fits perfectly. It's minimalistic, not at all sweeping strings like the ones of 'Out of Africa'. Just one small complaint: I wish Lee had filmed in Cinemascope just because of the great visuals in the mountains; I think this would have made the movie even stronger.See this movie and you will hopefully see the world in a different light after watching it.",Brokeback Mountain
604,ajsmacdonaLd,a masterpiece,9,5 January 2006,"It is my opinion that this story is truly beautiful and still so frustrating at the same time. It gets to the heart of a homophobic society we are all forced to live in. It is truly a heartbreaking tale of how intolerant society can be and most times are. With such a tiny role, Jacks mother had more of an affect on me than any other actor. Her unspoken acceptance of her sons choices in this era(1960's-1970's) of ignorance and hatred was so well done that I have a hard time getting her out of my mind. It is truly an example of a mother's unconditional love in such a redneck era. Overall, I thought this was brilliant. Never overboard, leaving the audience to think for themselves. I am blown away at other's comments stating that they were confused, bewildered. Why is it that when a person goes to a movie, it is assumed that the writer has to spell out each and every little thing for them? Think for yourselves for the love of God. If you are mature enough to be admitted to see this film, then have an open mind and for God's sake....USE IT! Again, I will state- NEVER OVERBOARD, LEAVING THE AUDIENCE TO THINK FOR THEMSELVES......... A masterpiece....A masterpiece.",Brokeback Mountain
605,ilikedolphin,A remarkable gay movie,10,17 September 2015,"This might be the most famous gay movie. Jack and Ennis's faces and their touching story are known by thousands of people around the world.In 1963, one bright summer in Western Wyoming, two young cowboys named Jack Twist and Ennis Delmar work together to herd cattle on a mountain. Jack is more talkative, and good at riding horses. Ennis lost his parents at an early age and is shy. One day, on a very cold night, they drink too much and Jack and Ennis sleep together under the effect of alcohol and hormones. The two 19 year old young men fall in love with each other. They have the best time of their lives that summer.Under the pressure of society, Jack and Ennis go back to their normal lives. They have their own families and live in different places. They meet each other again 4 years later. Time does not dilute their love. They miss each other so much. In the following more than 10 years, they date regularly. Unfortunately, Jack passes away in an accident.After Jack's death, Ernest goes to Jack's parents' farm. He wants to take Jack's ashes back to Brokeback Mountain where they met each other. In Jack's room, he finds ""a secret"": their shirts which they wore before are neatly set in the same clothes rack. It makes Ennis suddenly cry. He realizes how much Jack loved him, and also how deeply he loves Jack. The witness of their love is Brokeback Mountain.I believe if an afterlife exists, they will reunite again with their deep love.",Brokeback Mountain
606,PrivateBozz,It takes two guys to show us love,10,18 March 2006,"What is love? Looks like a simple question..But when we bring ourselves to look at the male-female relationships around us closely (and even more honestly!), we will discover that in very few cases love is the main reason for them to exist. Relationships are often build on factors like comfort, addiction or the fear of loneliness. But the main reason for a relationship is an other: Picturing a 'normal' couple that marries, gets children, sees their children grow up and have families themselves while they get old together, gives us the feeling those people live a complete life. Something tells us that this is the reason why we exist. And it's in our nature, of course. Mens urge to spread his DNA, woman's urge to give birth to a child, the urge to leave something of us behind before we have to go. Even today, even as modern people, we are primitive beings.That is what stands behind almost every romance we witness. It's so much part of our image of a complete life, that even every movie has to have a romance in it to seem complete, may it be the next best superficial action flick or a more intellectual drama (the exception proves the rule, of course).So what is love then? Does this romantic image that we have in our heads when we think about this feeling exist at all? Or is it just a trick of nature to make us reproduce, to ensure mankind's survival?One single movie, called 'Brokeback Mountain', shows us brutally that love DOES exist. And it's two average guys who make us feel it all. Those two are forced to experience a strong affection towards one another, and through them we realize what this feeling looks like, ripped of all patterns. That affection is not explainable. It is not even wanted. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. Every justification for it is taken away. What's left is nothing but pure love.It's an assault on your mind, body and soul. It is raw and violent. It's a force of nature.That movie holds a firm grip on my heart ever since I watched it the first time, and I don't think it will ever let go of me completely. Yes, 'Brokeback Mountain' does make people think, and yes, 'Brokeback Mountain' does open your eyes. But most of all, 'Brokeback Mountain' does make you FEEL.",Brokeback Mountain
607,netty1968,A true depiction of forbidden love...,9,2 June 2006,"It's been a while since I saw Brokeback Mountain, but it's emotive content still resonates to this day.To over-analyse this film would do it a disservice, as it is in it's simplicity that the story revels.Although focusing upon the forbidden love of two men (set in the ultra masculine world of cowboys and rodeos), it manages to convey the warmth, devotion and unrequited emotions of essentially a couple who happen to fall in love.Here's lies it's magic; the two leads (played with exceptional restraint by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall) quietly invite the viewer into their relationship, gradually making one feel they are watching an intimate piece of reality.The essence of the story could be transposed to any supposedly socially forbidden coupling (bi-racial, lesbianism, etc) but it's core message is one of sustaining a love that has to be hidden and never explored to it's full potential.Ang Lee (as always) provides a beautiful cinematic back drop to the evolving epic and clearly allowed the actors to freely explore the range of their characters.I could go on but I feel the best way for any potential viewers to embrace the magic of this film is to pick a quiet afternoon, rent the DVD and settle back to enjoy what is truly an exceptional piece of movie making.",Brokeback Mountain
608,petcrows,cardbord cutouts - not believable,4,26 March 2006,"The professional reviews for this film are strange. Some loved it. A few thought it was formulaic. One wanted more body fluids to show up in the gay sex scene. I didn't have the later sentiment. It's possible it was formulaic perhaps. It wasn't particularly moving for me though either. What I came away from the film with was this impression: The movie was believable up until the first gay sex scene. And all the subsequent gay encounters were not believable either. At one point one of the two core cowboys met another presumably gay man and he asked him out. I watched in disbelief and wondered ""how the hell did he know that third man was gay?"" It was as if they both had built in gay-dar. Maybe since I'm not gay (so far as I know, but I'm pretty sure not) maybe I don't have a keen gay-dar spidey-sense, and perhaps I cannot recognize it in others. On the other hand perhaps the best option is to go with my first and continuing core impressions on this one, and that is this: all the gay portrayals in this film felt fake and artificial and like cardboard. Perhaps the more emotionally malleable or infantile among us saw great & deep meaning & value, & sucked up all the stuff which selected professional reviewers saw through as trite formula. As for me I found the film boring, not satisfying for the most part, and largely not believable.",Brokeback Mountain

The plot was mostly that of two angst-filled men (who were possibly bisexual, possibly gay, possibly mixed), neither of whom got what they wanted.If people think they are going to see ""gay sex"" they should forget it. There are better shots of Anne Hathaway's tits (which are impressive and do not look like the work of aftermarket manufacturing) than anything on the guys.However, if this film had been about a man and a woman, it would have been relegated to the dust bin. It simply doesn't have much to it. It is barely a love story, mostly a tragedy of how two people can fail to get what they might want.Fair at best.

When the wife sees them kissing, everyone in the theater gasped, but then we had to wait another hour before she confronted him with it, which was the only interesting scene. And the dialouge was stupid at times. ""Why can't I quit you?"" I just don't get the love story. It seemed much more about lust and perversion than love.

I came away with the same feeling. Now, I do happen to be gay, and having two handsome leading men in the film was certainly a treat.What impressed me more was the performances in the ensemble. From Randy Quaid and Linda Cardellini ( who have relatively small roles ) to Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway ( both very fine, worthy of Oscar mention ) to Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, who gave the best performances of the year, and of their careers.This is a 10 out of 10.

And a ""9"" for shooting a movie without much action and without much dialog and still not boring me. Ang Lee is just super talented. An Uber-Director. What bothers me though: why would everyone think of it as such a great love story?? What it really boils down to is two men who are committed in serious relationships and who are having children, yet break their vows over and over again. Let's disregard the fact that they are homosexual: here we have two people continuously committing adultery and thus hurting their spouses over the years. Especially Alma's suffering is hard to take. And consider Jack Twist's attitude: While Ennis really sticks with his responsibilities, Jack would just get up and leave his little son as soon as Ennis would permit him to.

European films have shown a few good ones too, but this is the first American one to break the mold (though there are many small ones that I may have missed).Even if it wasn't a gay themed movie, the story was very good too.

614,sjohntucson,You got to stand it,10,19 December 2005,"I drove to Scottsdale to see this today, about a 120 mile drive. That's right, you guessed it, I had some pretty high expectations.Turns out they were pretty reasonable expectations, too. The reviews praising Heath Ledger's and Michelle Williams performances, the cinematography, the source material, McMurtry's & Ossana's screenplay, and Lee's direction, were all pretty much on the money. And although I've read a lot of reviews that say Jake G's performance didn't, couldn't compare to Ledger's, I disagree. Jake's performance was just as perfect, although his character isn't the focus so much as Ledger's.I am pretty devastated still, though I got home many hours ago. The story keeps playing in my head, and, like many great works of art, the movie seems to keep taking ""different shapes"" in my head in the aftermath. Honestly, I couldn't even tell you at this point whether the overall effect is particularly gay-positive without arguing against myself in an hour.I'm not even convinced that the climactic event isn't a little ambiguous (I got the same sense when I read the short story, too). But while it seems to cause (to me) the meaning of the movie to kind of flicker between two different messages, the final effect is the same either way. Like I said, devastating. I didn't see a single dry eye coming out of the theater when it was over. I can't really explain what I mean without revealing too much, but you'll know what I mean when you see it. And, boy howdy, you have to see this. To be honest, I don't know if the straight folk are gonna dig this as much as I did; a lot of the story could have come from my own life, and the lives of my friends. But even if it doesn't resonate as powerfully with you as with me, it'll surely give you a sense of how toxic a closeted life can be, while simultaneously pointing out the stakes of not being closeted.",Brokeback Mountain

But this isn't a gay cowboy movie. It's a love story, it is a life story too. Just a really well told story about the relationships of two people. I hope this film doesn't get attention because it's gay. (I am gay by the way.) Heath Ledger really is fantastic. But not because he plays a gay character. If he had fallen in love with with a woman this would have been as equally wonderful of a performance. Jake is fantastic too. He could have very easily been the school quarterback falling in love the head female cheerleader, and his performance would have been just as wonderful. This movie isn't special because it's about gay characters. I love that it is, and that it's so well done, but don't go see this to see a gay cowboy movie. Go see this because we have all had loves in our lives that had struggles. We've all had moments of uncertainty in relationships, and yeah, we've all done things other people may not agree with, but we did them because it was true to ourselves.

616,yes_i_am84,This *blew* me *away*...,10,26 February 2007,"While the closing credits of ""Brokeback Mountain"" were scrolling down my TV screen yesterday night, what I was feeling was, most of all, the need to sit in front of my computer and share the emotions this movie had caused in me right away. I had to wait until the next morning to do it, but now that I'm here... I said it in the subject line, and I'll say it again: this blew me away, and as another reviewer has said, it is a movie very likely to make history.Director Ang Lee and lead actors Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal take the best advantage of a meaningful and thoughtful script that appeals to the emotional intelligence of the viewer with very, very few over-the-top moments. It would have been so easy while dealing with such material! But in such hands, no way. And the result is this gem of a movie.Ang Lee puts in this all the care and gentleness already displayed in the direction of ""Sense and Sensibility"", a movie that, at a first sight, bears very little resemblance of contents both to this one and to the ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""-like productions of the director. Yet Lee's trademark can be found in all of these, and his ability of picking good stories and directing them with the best level of emotional intensity is evident in the green landscapes of Wyoming as it is in Austen's England or in a half-fantasy, half-reality Far East.Heath Ledger is stunning in the leading role of Ennis, and as much as I admire Gyllenhaal's performance as Jack, too, I pick him as the true king of this movie. His role is maybe the more demanding of the two, as his character is the one that is less eager to become aware of the attraction he feels for his friend, and more worried that someone might know about their relationship. His internal struggle bring the best acting moments of the movie, like the goodbye between the two men after the sheep herding season is over. ""We might see each other again..."" ""Yes. Might be."" One word about the ladies: they may not have the big screen time, but they are all amazing in their small but wonderfully written roles. Anne Hathaway, Michelle Williams, Linda Cardellini, Kate Mara and Anna Faris add a lot to the already great mosaic of thoughts and feelings that this movie is.Its dealing with homosexuality in a relatively explicit way has brought this movie to the spotlight, but it would be a tremendous and unjust simplification to reduce it to a story of two gay cowboys. In fact, it would be a simplification to reduce it to any stereotype at all. It is, most of all, a movie of subtly and intelligently conveyed feelings that I cannot recommend enough. Let it speak to your heart.",Brokeback Mountain
617,coolsharpharp,"Frustrated desire, intolerance and love",9,9 February 2006,"It was a coin toss between Jarhead and Brokeback just before purchasing the ticket and the film Gods must have been with me. My worry about this film was that it would merely be about gay rights and wrongs. Thankfully I was wrong and it turned out to be a film that transcends gay issues. It is a film about frustrated desire, intolerance and love. You do not have to be gay to get this film just human.The basic premise is that Jack Twist(Gyllenhaal)and Heath Ledger (Ennis Del Marr) are in love in a world where being openly gay is a death sentence. They each marry and have families but are only truly happy when with each other. They meet up once or twice a year on Brokeback mountain over a twenty year period and share their frustrations at not being able to be with another.The sentimental moments in the film are genuine and not forced. It is easy to empathise with these characters if you have ever felt destructive love, frustration or a feeling that you do not fit in. The direction of the film by Ang Lee is fantastic. The film is suitably paced; the scenery is fantastic and the score is poignant.The performances across the board are superb. Right from the two main leads to their long suffering wives and the rest of the support cast. However, a special mention must go to Heath Ledger's portrayal of Ennis Del Mar who is a hard uneducated man who does not understand that their is a wider world to the one he is living in. Ledger's performance is understated, raw and genuine. Another actor may have over acted the part to the detriment of the character.The final scene of the film is one of the best that I have seen in recent times. There is no dramatic twist but their is a realisation on the part of Ennis Del Marr that not all desires need be unfulfilled; that if you are wise enough to see the wider picture all possibilities are open to those who are brave enough to take them.This film is highly recommended to those people who are bored with the run of the mill garbage that Hollywood seems to produce these days. If your a fan of run of the mill garbage, give this film a miss. This film is effective because of the fine cast, good direction and the visualisation of human nature at its best and worst.",Brokeback Mountain
618,snauth,"It is propaganda for romantic love, after all.",6,21 January 2006,"I admire Ang Lee, I always did, at least since the Icestorm, which is one of my favorites of all times. Ang Lee is a lot in the (movie)news right now, because of the media's self-acclaimed ""oscar buzz"". He always looks modest, without false pretensions and like a very nice guy. No problem here. This movie, however, is propaganda. What is done here is to connect the promise of living a life close to the forces of nature (""natural life"") with the inner forces of romantic love, which supposedly are stronger than death and of course in opposition to the trivial forces of societal prejudice. Stories about this kind of romantic love, which are in line with ""human nature"" and against the ""unnatural social"", are well known and this story is told very well here. It gets its special drive because the lovers are men. Their love is impossible, in this time and at this place, no doubt about it, but it is not like this any longer. And here the movie becomes problematic. If this story is - as Ang Lee claims in the aforementioned interviews - more about something universal: romantic love, then it is naive at best: This kind of romantic love is not universal at all. If this is all about romantic love, that it is close to itself only in its own suspension, then I do not need it either. If the movie actually is about love between men in the 1960s/70s in the USA, then it has a lot of real historic interest, but it should not pretend to be more. The general ennui of men who are forced to be good salesmen, who live in marriages which also could happen over the phone, who are surrounded by responsibilities and crying children, all this is not due to not living ""natural"" romantic love - be it between men or not. The curse under which we are forced to live nowadays is to be able to live with our romantic loves, and to witness how that extraordinary blessing turns into ashes after some years. However, because I have such a high respect for Ang Lee's work, I do not rule out that he is right and that there is some more universal lesson in this fine piece of cinematography: that real love is about not finding fulfillment and that it is worth it.-",Brokeback Mountain

To approach this movie primarily as a ""gay cowboy movie"" is tantamount to regarding ""King Kong"" as a story about bestiality. I personally am offended by the evangelicals and their ilk seeing nothing but sodomy in this beautifully crafted telling of an affecting love story. What dirty minds these Bible- thumping morons have. They see only ugliness where there is only beauty.Of the two protagonists, Jack (Gyllenhaal) and Innis (Ledger), only the former is definitely gay, whereas Innis is a laconic, combative, probably homophobic loner, who finds it difficult to make any human connection. He finally makes that connection with Jack.A beautiful love story, admirably told by a master movie-maker, Ang Lee. Paradoxically, I hope that this movie does not become too great a commercial success, because if it does, it will become retrospectively trivialized by scores of Hollywood ""gay-themed"" copycat dramas concerned only about the bottom line.",Brokeback Mountain

I never let them influence me differently. I stayed a huge supporter of the movie and when I saw it I was blown away. I never thought it could be like that. It is the most incredible, raw, passionate, and heartbreaking story that has ever graced the theaters. When people began labeling it as the 'gay cowboy movie' I became extremely upset! How could people judge it before they had ever even seen it, or even knew what it's about! I defended it until one friend gave in and went out and saw it. When they came back, they cried because they admitted they were wrong, and that they shouldn't have judged it! but still nobody listened. For a while I abandoned the 'campaign' if you will, for Brokeback and began spreading the word to people I knew very well that it was a spectacular movie. When the men I knew heard about it they scoffed and said that it was sick, and any chick who wanted to see it had major issues. I just told then to shove their opinions up their a***, pardon my french. I simply didn't care what they said about it. But in general this movie is the best movie i have seen in my entire life.

The story and film present a central theme of contemporary gender studies: the meaning of masculinity and the experience of being a man in postmodern Western culture. We must remember that there are urban cowboys, suburban cowboys, European cowboys. This is hugely moving film. It's epigraph might have been Enid Starkie's comment: ""Only two members of the same sex have power to wound one another so deeply when things go wrong between them, and to wound one another where hurt is most intolerable.""

626,Slack_Er,"One thing is for sure, you'll know exactly what turns you on and off by the end of this one!",6,11 March 2006,"When I was confronted with the first graphic sex scene in this movie, being the politically correct individual I am, I tried my best to view it as a normal love story. Ya know... just your typical steamy spontaneous romp. Instead, I couldn't help but cringe and feel like I was watching a sequel to the prison rape scene in ""American History X"" or ""Mi Familia!"" It was then that I realized this REALLY WAS a movie about two gay cowboys! Quite frankly, if ""Brokeback Mountain"" had been about a man and a woman, this movie wouldn't have been given any attention whatsoever. I've seen love stories with much better screenplays, acting, you name it! Yeah, I know, that's missing the point of ""Brokeback Mountain"" because the gay issue is what makes it unique, but I'm always wary of movies that you can accurately claim: ""If not for (insert event, plot catch, casting decision) no one would remember this at all."" I call it the ""Memento Catch."" Remember how stoked everyone was when ""Memento"" first came out? They claimed it was a brilliant movie! That Christopher Nolan was the next Hitchcock! Well, the thing about ""Memento"" was that the events themselves weren't anything special, just the order in which they were presented. I'm not taking away from Nolan's movie at all, it was a brilliant screenplay! Imagine that, writers DO matter. Someone let Hollywood know before they saturate us with the next ""Dukes of Hazzard"" or ""Scooby-Doo."" But there wasn't really anything special to that movie other than the clever order of events, which to my knowledge, no one had attempted before. But now, years later, after we've regrouped and seen some of Nolan's other stuff such as ""Batman Begins"" -- which is decidedly average when you consider it cost $200 million to make -- ""Memento"" doesn't seem to have the lasting power that say, ""The Godfather"" or ""Star Wars"" does. Anyways.... my point is that once the hype dies and people on both sides of the spectrum cool down a little -- both the homophobic haters and the people pushing their agenda -- is anyone really going to remember this? Ya know, when I check Netflix every week, they have a big section dedicated to gay/lesbian film. You're telling me that no one has ever made a movie like this? I guess the difference is this was the first gay project that was actually able to pull in big name directors and actors. After all, the Oscars don't seem to take you serious until you sign a few household names.",Brokeback Mountain
627,beachboy1893,Beautiful unconventional love movie,8,28 February 2006,"I think this movie deserves all the attention the press and the critic have witnessed. It's the moving story of the struggling, passionate and in someway tragic love between the two cowboys Ennis and Jack. Both Heath Ledger and Jake Gillenhaal give us a stunning performance that will make of them two stars. I'm very glad to see also that Michelle Williams has received the Academy Awards nomination for Best Supporting Actress and I see it as a great achievement for a so young actress who already had a great and serious career. It's definitely one of the best movies of this year and it's good to see that a non-conventional love movie can have such a success in a world full of prejudices.",Brokeback Mountain
628,hmghosthost,Why bother?,10,14 March 2006,"At the time I write this there is already some 1500 viewer comments, and I doubt anyone will read that many posts to finally come to my own comments. So I don't really know why I should bother. But in case there is that one person who does get this far....All I can say is that this movie hits you hard - and it hurts.The first thing that caught my eye was the broad variety of people in the theater... the very old, the very young, groups of girls, straight couples, gay couples, blacks and whites. I saw old men with their wives, I watched them cry. I felt the audience suck in a collective nervous breath when the first love scene occurs, but by the time the second love scene occurred the audience was leaning forward in their seats as though they would fall into the screen. This is not a movie you can effectively comment on because it is not one that is meant to entertain. It is an event, an event that grabs you by the front of your shirt and shakes you and forces you to realize that the real barter of life is love and relationships.But if any comment of value is to be made about the awesomeness of this film, it is the testimony of untold numbers of heterosexual men who are clearly mesmerized and captivated by it. It is not because they have suddenly felt homosexual feelings, but it is because men have been forced in society to keep all emotions and feelings locked away inside, and I think this movie touches them in that secret place of emotion and shows them that they are not alone. They are shown that they can show their love, they can show their emotions....if only life would back off and shut up and finally let them be a real person. I almost felt an urge to hug every straight guy in the theater just to tell them I know how they feel.I have a feeling that this movie will have one of the highest video sales of all time - not only purchased by those who saw it and loved it, but by all those men who wanted to see it but did not have the nerve to publicly attend a theater screening. I for one hope this movie helps people become better humans and more focused on the thing that matters most - love.",Brokeback Mountain
629,Marc-105,A masterpiece,10,23 December 2005,"(Written 12-23-05.) I've seen this movie twice. The first time, I had expectations that it would more erotic and sadder than it turned out to be. I cried a bit at the end. Then I saw it again a week later, and haven't been the same since. If I think or talk about Brokeback Mountain too much, I start crying (so far, six days after seeing it the second time). I probably can't be objective about the film because I'm in love with it, for all the reasons you'll see in the other comments: awesome acting, an extraordinary script, and direction that brought out the best in both. But more so because of its emotional impact. I have never had this reaction to a movie. If you feel lonely (as I did) before seeing the movie, be prepared.This paragraph is written on March 6, and I'm still shell-shocked from last night's Oscars. (I saw the movie for the 11th time on Saturday.) I realized this afternoon how angry I am: not giving BBM the Best Picture Oscar is in the same ballpark as making My Fair Lady without Julie Andrews. They are the two worst things to happen in the history of movies. Maybe last night's tragedy will fade in time. I don't mean to trivialize the snub of BBM by this comparison, but my anger is comparable.Consider a couple of other times when the Director and Picture Oscar were split. In 1967, Mike Nichols won for directing The Graduate, which I remember vividly. Does anybody remember In the Heat of the Night? A less exceptional example is 1998, when Spielberg won for directing Saving Private Ryan, and Shakespeare in Love won for Best Picture. Yes it was good, but nowhere close to Saving Private Ryan. 1972 is a counter-example, w/ Bob Fosse winning for directing Cabaret and Godfather winning Best Picture.Five or ten or twenty years from now, BBM will be remembered for the landmark and masterpiece that it is. Crash will be almost forgotten. Some other thoughts on the movie after so many viewings. Ledger's and Gyllenhaal's acting is some of the best I ever expect to see. I'm still stunned at--among other things--how good their (and everyone's) accents were. Just about every word sounded perfect throughout the entire film. And Gyllenhaal does a lot of good acting w/ his eyes. A friend, contrasting Gyllenhaal's previous movies w/ BBM, gave credit to Ang Lee for bringing out Jake's talent. I suspect the same would apply to what Ang Lee did for Heath's performance. Both of these guys are under 30, and it's a scary pleasure to imagine what kind of careers they have ahead of themselves.Finally, let me put in a plug for the trailer that's on the Brokeback website. In its way, it's as good as the movie--a masterpiece that makes me cry. The music breaks your heart. Ironically, I haven't seen it in a theater because I'm always there to see BBM.",Brokeback Mountain
630,kevin6527,I am so proud of Ang Lee,10,21 January 2006,"I am a Taiwanese living in Berlin. I just saw a special screening here in Germany and cried soooo hard at the end of the movie. I am so proud since the director is from Taiwan as well.Homosexuality is not really a big deal here in Europe. But it is a big deal in the USA. I admire Lee's courage for doing this movie. Honestly, how can gender be a matter when it comes to true love? It is hard to find true love, when we find it, we should be celebrating with even more love. We are lucky enough to live in this modern world. What happened to the two cowboys in the film is just a heartbreaking reminder, telling us how valuable true love is. And how Lee masters the accumulation of emotions is just amazing. Excellent acting. Let's all love. Stop spreading messages of hate. We love and we cry. We all have a brokeback mountain inside of us. Thank you, Ang Lee.",Brokeback Mountain
631,hydebee,the gay cowboy movie or more?,9,25 January 2006,"Brokeback mountain has been described as the gay cowboy movie, when in fact it is a story about being true to yourself, no this writer is not gay so I can not say how it feels from that perspective, but I must say anyone who has ever had to live a lie of any source knows, you must be true to yourself. this movie begins with them meeting and working together on broke back mountain in the 1960's we quickly learn that Ennis (heath ledger) character has came from a sad and tragic background and is basically alone in this world, we find Jake g. Character is from a more traditional background but has a twinge of religious fanaticism in his family; they meet and work together, that summer.They share their stories ,the loneliness of being alone on the mountain brings them together, in a scene I would say actually involves rape they make out for the first time, after they leave the mountain it shows heath vomiting from what he has done, while morally this is wrong heath is caught up in this ,unable to let go of this but knowing it is wrong to others, the story could have been a interracial or a husband cheating with another woman on his wife but it is a story of 2 men or any story of forbidden love, as we see them together on the mountain we see the last few days as being a time of awkwardness, a fight which leaves a bloody shirt on the mountain?, and many other questions I wish that mr lee had not shown certain scenes and left the conclusions to the audience I think this would have played out better and had more impact !!!! We go into the future a postcard tells us that Jake g, character is coming thru town, the wife ask who is he, the answer a old fishing buddy ,yet he never seems to bring home any fish,. Randy quaid statement you boys had a time on the mountain,So many things just don't add up for heath's wife (she had a great part and should have been nominated) what is a woman suppose to do to keep her hubby from cheating physically or emotionally? then we see Jake g character, his wife(Anne h, another one of my favorite and she is gorgeous as usual) just having a baby , living a life of lies ,his in-laws don t help as they are intrusive and rude, he is stuck in his mundane life .They meet every so often to go fishing, but in reality it is to escape their so called life's, they try to recapture the moment but still it is gone, heath tells Jake we must let it go, but Jake can not understand why it cant be this way all the time, heath tries to explain that society is not ready and probably never will be. Jake tells heath he can not live like this anymore, the next scene shows him picking up a male prostitute,To sum it all up we go into the future we see heath getting a call from Jake g wife who tells how he was killed in a tragic accident of BY A TRUCK TIRE, but instead he was really beat to death by gay bashers.We see heath going to Jake's parents house the mom is sort of numb but in some way you realize she knows her son was gay, the dad is just the opposite and never had a ideal, we see heath finding the shirt that he wore many years ago on the mountain blood stained, he hugs the shirt as to capture a time that is now lost and gone, it does not show romantic love or parental love but just love!!!!The father tells heath hell no you can not take him to the mountain he will be buried in the family plot; this is more than likely how any parent would have felt that had lost a child. We go in the future again heaths daughter is visiting him telling him of her future wedding, he is happy for her, but like so many in this movie you get the feeling she never knew , it ends with him opening the closet(coming out of the closet?)And the shirt being there hugging it as if Jake g was still there but in reality he is gone!!!!!See this movie and make up your own minds.",Brokeback Mountain
632,marchesa,Heart wrenchingly beautiful,10,6 February 2006,"This film is simply fantastic! It is not often that I see a film and am so completely drawn in and overwhelmed by all of its aspects. Endless comments and praise about superb performances from Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are not exaggerated. Michelle Williams delivers a wonderful performance as the innocent bystander of the relationship between Ennis & Jack.What is often overlooked is that the cinematography, scoring and visual impact of the film is stupendous, even overwhelming in places. All this combined with a brilliant adaptation of a simple, sad, but very short story makes one wonder at it all.My only disappointment is that the film had such limited release early on (and probably still does!) and that the publicity machine of Hollywood found it endlessly necessary to remind of of the fact that the male stars are straight. It is a sad commentary: that the terrible prejudices depicted so powerfully in the film still exist today. This is not a sad tale of how things were oh, so long ago, but resonates strongly today as well. One can only hope that these brilliant performances and the wide acceptance the movie has achieved will help to break down that barrier of society.",Brokeback Mountain
633,alexgs1,coitus interruptus (*may have spoilers here*),6,19 February 2006,"I saw Brokeback Mountain yesterday and left the theatre with this piercing feeling, which is not pleasant at all.The general feeling in the end is like a 'coitus interruptus' by a huge pain piercing your stomach.Looking back to the movie, it gives you a wish of having changed the facts to have the plot ended up differently.Also, I missed loves scenes in the movie (is that only me?) as this is all about the love between the 2 guys, but once they finally get together, you don't see them cuddling, holding, touching, kissing each other. They go to those fishing-escapes, but the movie show them only chatting, discussing future, etc. As if they were only chaps. I guess if someone has to wait 4 years to see the one he loves, at the moment you are together with the person, you would enjoy every single minute the more you can.I don't know.... I recognise it is a good movie, but I didn't like the insatisfaction feeling it brought me, so I am not sure if I can give it a high score.",Brokeback Mountain
634,sasya,A true work of art - makes you both think and feel,10,27 July 2006,"I was blown away by this film. It's so powerful and full of raw emotions that I can't shake it even several days later. I like it better and better.The story develops slowly and I started out thinking that the characters were pretty unsympathetic, but all of a sudden I was 110% emotionally invested in the story which then seemed so much more powerful exactly because no idealisation had been done.The film is tricky to read in several places and the ambiguity and the unsaid speak louder than the dialog. The attention you can feel has been paid to minute details forces you to pay attention and think both while and after you've seen the it. There's a lot to admire and notice, even on subsequent viewings.Outstanding camera work and scenery, jaw dropping performances and a truly complex yet gripping story line.",Brokeback Mountain
635,oldgal67,The point is.........,8,6 February 2006,"It's surprising so many people have completely missed the point of this film; which is how a gay man - Jack Twist - seduces a man who may never, otherwise, have known he might be gay. Ennis was already engaged when the film started and did go ahead with his wedding and married life as the hard-working father supporting his wife and two children. Ennis married, as planned, for love; Jack eventually married for money after he was himself seduced and forced into marriage as the result of a pregnancy. It was obvious that Ennis could have valued Jack as a friend without the sexual aspect of their relationship. Jack couldn't - so all of their meetings became primarily sexual. Ennis never tried to solicit another gay in the times between his meetings with Jack - Jack did so repeatedly and it was Jack who couldn't bear to be separated; Ennis never goes to Jack - Jack always comes to Ennis. This is not a gay romance; it is a picture of how a dominant gay behaved and ultimately left his conquest alive but unable to function either as a straight man or as a gay without Jack as his sexual companion. Jack, it is suggested, died for his overt sexuality; Ennis survived because he was not overtly gay - the only person who knew, his wife, loved him enough not to betray him. This was 1963 when to be homosexual was much more dangerous than it is today.",Brokeback Mountain
636,pdlaker34,Most Important film of the decade and by far the best year of 2005,10,31 December 2008,"Look, I am a 16 year old-straight male, and Brokeback Mounatin is one of my favorite films of the decade and I admit that and get made fun of and called a homo by my friends. Now, about a year and a half ago I would have done the same thing, but then I realized I loved film and actually watched Brokeback Mounatin and realized I was being an ignorant prick. It seems like everyone I am friends or family with will not give this film a chance because it is about a homosexual relationship and it pisses me off. If you don't like the film for a certain reason and you give it a chance or even give it a chance and say it made you too uncomfortable, then i can accept that, but don't say anything about the film unless you see it. This film is a heart-breaking, melodramatic, nuanced masterpiece. Ang Lee really makes the most nuanced films between The Wedding Banquet, The Ice Storm, This film, and the masterpiece which is Crouching Tiger, he is one of the best directors alive. Heath Ledger gives such a bold, theme detailed, and understated performance and when he finally snaps it is heart breaking. I respect Jake Gyllenahl for taking the role and he is good, but not great. All the female actresses like Hathaway and Williams are great as well. Larry McMurtry wrote the screenplay and you can tell. The film has a very similar bleak feeling dealing with a certain place with same type of enclosed and scared people that The Last Picture Show dealt with, one of my favorite films of all time. I normally don't cry during films, but I teared up during this film. I cried in in The Last Picture Show, Last Tango In Paris, The Pianist, Life Is Beautiful, Elephant, The Deer Hunter, Amelie, The Bicycle Thief, Letters From Iwo Jima, Forrst Gump, Amores Peros, The Sweet Hereafter, and now this film. It is a very powerful, well made, well written, detailed, and important film, maybe the most important film of the decade. An emotional masterpiece",Brokeback Mountain
637,caincrue,worth seeing but not great,7,3 February 2006,"A lot of people I respect really enjoyed this movie, so I thought I would also. Although it wasn't bad, I left wondering why it's getting so much play for Oscar. I found myself bored through a lot of the movie, especially the beginning and end. I just didn't buy how the two main characters fell in love. I also couldn't stand Heath Ledger's accent. How he got a best actor nomination is beyond me. I went in liking him but not really liking Jake G, I thought Jake's performance was great - especially the Thanksgiving dinner scene, my opinion of him has gone up... I also thought the women who played their wives were pretty good, their roles were fairly small but they did very well.Overall the movie was okay, but the problem I had was I thought the story was weak, I mean it was originally like a 12 page short story so they had a lot of material to fill, and that is where I thought it was lacking.I have seen all pictures in the best picture category and in my opinion the one that should win is Crash",Brokeback Mountain
638,nifnn,Truly remarkable!!,10,9 November 2009,"To be honest, I put off watching this film until recently, not because I'm homophobic or anything of the sort, but as a straight guy I assumed it wouldn't be my cup of tea and I wouldn't be able to relate to it, I assumed it would be homo-indulgent & hard to watch, like a chick flick or watching Science fiction if you're not a science fiction head. I was aware of the jokes and stigma attached to this film and I never found myself in a hurry to see it, despite the glowing reviews, I just assumed it would be boring & not my thing.Well I can tell you I have almost never been so wrong about anything in my life.. The sheer depth of this film blew me away on so many levels. Its the kind of film that after seeing it, you start questioning aspects of your own life, not necessarily your sexuality, but things like relationships with those close to you or in the past, the powerful emotions ''what if?'' that are characterised throughout this stunning film. One of the most impacting things about this film is its depiction of love, and how powerful it can be in its rawest form. Lets face it these 2 dudes are madly in love, and it is heartbreaking to see them not being able to get what they really want out of life. Heath Ledger is obviously fantastic and puts his heart and soul into this film, but I think the performance of Jake gyllenhaal is underrated and is equally as good, this is a fine actor with a good career ahead of him.Anyway to wrap it up if you want to be emotionally challenged and taken out your comfort zone I recommend you take some time out to watch this wonderful film.",Brokeback Mountain
639,d-l-polonsky,Boring Movie,4,5 June 2012,"I didn't like Brokeback Mountain. Of course, many people reading that statement, without knowing anything else about me, are going to think, most likely, I didn't like it because I'm homophobic. Actually, since the main problem with the film is that it's freakin' boring, having more gay sex scenes and beefcake shots would undoubtedly have improved it. I don't agree with the other reviewers that ""nothing happens in this film"". It's about a man (Jake Gyllenhall) who's lust/love for another man (Heath Ledger) is largely unreciprocated and how the situation tears their families apart and makes them both miserable. How is this nothing? If this were a straight couple, would you call it insubstantial subject matter for a film? The problem is that it plays out way too slowly and, because of bad editing and shots in the conversation scenes that last too long there's a weird feeling of emotional separation from the characters. The second half of the film - where Ennis marries a woman and has kids and Jack gets a girlfriend who's also his business parter and this one-sided reciprocation of this ongoing love-lust of the two men ruins their relationships and makes them miserable - is more interesting and involving because it's probably what would have happened due to the societal values and bigotry of the time, and because the slow pacing serves this subject matter better since it all would have happened really slowly in real life and you can really feel Jack's frustration. Michelle Williams is probably the best actor in the film. Gyllenhall and Ledger both have a not-totally-convincing and slightly cutesy acting style (partly, but not mostly, the fault of the writing), but Williams totally embodies the part. She's a totally believable and recognizable type of naive young woman who would grow up in Wyoming at that time. A few people I know, mostly gay people, have mentioned that it's a big problem with the film that neither of them said ""I love you"" to each other. Well, maybe the connection was mostly physical lust and not love. That happens. Ennis was too emotionally shut-down and too influenced by the homophobia (I hate that word; ""gay-hatred"" or something like that would be better) of the time to consciously recognize the relationship was even partially about love and probably wouldn't have said it even if he did. It might have been better for the emotional impact of the film if Jack had said, ""I love you"" to Ennis, but either saying it or not would have been realistic. Some people said there's no chemistry between the two of them. So what? There are people in real life that you can't believe are together. Ledger's performance is overrated. He plays a person with limited emotional expression well, but like Billy Bob Thornton's Karl Childers, it's easier to play a part with limited emotional expression. Another problem is they don't visibly age in 15 years except for a little grey in the hair. I call it the Shawshank Syndrome. All in all, a movie with a good story badly paced and acted.",Brokeback Mountain

641,berty2001,Only about homosexuality as much as Romeo and Juliet about family feud,8,13 January 2006,"Though this has been described as a 'gay western', I think the this is misleading. What it really is, is a romance set in western America. It is only about homosexuality as much as Romeo and Juliet is about a family feud, or Casablanca is about the war. These things are just obstacles that the couple need to get over if they are to be together. In that sense, Brokeback is an old fashioned love story.And what a story. Beautifully shot (though it does fail to totally convince that the mountain itself is as isoltated as they would have you believe), Ang Lee has in a sense remade Crouching Tiger, or at least the ChowYun Fat/Michelle Yeoh story. It is about two people whose love each other, but one who's honour will not let them be together.The biggest surprise in this movie is Heath Ledger. His performance is brilliant. Not showy, which ,means that he may not win an Oscar, but it stays with you long after the stunning landscape cinematography and western score.--Smaller Spoiler--Although over long (ending when Ennis goes to Jack's family homes would have been perfect), it is definitely worth seeing, if only once.",Brokeback Mountain
642,ptb4life,It's STILL That Gay Cowboy Movie (SPOILERS),4,8 April 2006,"So I finally watched most critics' so-called movie of the year last night, Brokeback Mountain. The most common thing I read about the movie was ""After you've seen it, you'll never call it 'That gay cowboy movie' again"". Guess what? It's still THAT GAY COWBOY MOVIE.Where to start....Well, Jack and Ennis are outside a trailer waiting for a job and they don't say anything... Then they get a job watching over sheep. For what seems like an eternity, THEY DON'T SAY ANYTHING. When Ennis (Heath Ledger) finally does talk, he mumbles so incoherently that you can't understand a word he says anyway. So they're all alone, hardly talking up on the mountain...once in a while Jack talks about the rodeo or something pointless. Then one night Ennis is sleeping outside while Jack is in his tent. Ennis is shivering and Jack tells him to get in the tent. Jack decides to put his arm around Ennis and Ennis pulls away and looks like he's going to fight him. Instead he pretty much bends him over and rapes him. It's not romantic, it's not sweet, it's violent and disgusting (and yes, if it was a man and a woman, it would still be violent and horrible). Then for some reason they get in a fist fight and Ennis's shirt gets all bloody and he leaves it behind.After they are done with their job they part ways and Ennis marries the slut from Dawson's Creek. They have 2 kids. Meanwhile Jack marries Princess Diaries (yes, we see her awesome boobs) and has one kid with her. 3 or 4 years later Jack comes to visit Ennis and make out in the ally and Dawson's Creek sees them (but says nothing). They then go on a few fishing trips each year. Eventually Dawson's Creek catches on and divorces Ennis.Lalalalala, 20 years passes and Ennis can't hold on to a job or a woman and he and Jack continue to go on fishing trips. They never say anything to each other really, they just hug and make eyes at each other. Then Jack finally breaks down and says ""I wish I could quit you"" or some nonsense. At this point, who the hell cares. I don't believe in them as a loving couple at all.Then Ennis gets a post card saying that Jack died. Ennis calls Princess Diaries to find out what happens. She goes on to tell him a story about him changing a tire and getting hit with the hub cap and drowning in his own blood (meanwhile they are showing a flashback of 3 dudes beating Jack up in a field).Ennis then goes to Jack's parents and goes to his old room and finds the bloody shirt from 20 years ago. Ennis sobs a little, takes the shirt and leaves. Now we're at Ennis's trailer. His daughter visits him with news that she's getting married. He says he can't come to the wedding because of his job, but then changes his mind. She leaves, and Ennis looks at the bloody shirt and says ""Jack, I swear.."" THE ENDWhy is my review so boring and matter of fact? Because this movie was BORING AND MATTER OF FACT! It was incredibly boring. They never really show you why the characters do what they do (other than a flashback of Ennis when he was a boy when his father showed him the body of a gay man that was murdered for being gay). For all the talk about this movie being romantic and whatever, I found it to be nothing of the sort. Two guys f***. Have sham marriages. Get together once in a while to f*** some more. Finally admit they love each other. Then one dies. Who cares!? I am the most over emotional guy I know...this movie affected me ZEROFor the record, I did not like this movie....not because it was about 2 guys, but because it was boring and crap. It was like 2 hours, but felt like 4. The acting sucked too. Heath Ledger got nominated for mumbling!? Gimme a break!4/10",Brokeback Mountain

This is the type of film making and the type of performances and the type of writing that you can't really say much about, as it's hard to find the words to describe them...or you just don't know where to start...All of the performances were great. Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams were definitely on point with very accurate portrayals of women in their situations...but obviously, this is Heath and Jake's film...They are so amazing as the LEADS (don't know why Jake has been made supporting) as Ennis and Jack. I was just in love with both of the characters for their bravery and, most of all, their love. They both give the performances of their life...and everything they do from now on will be compared to this film. Jake was shamefully snubbed, not receiving a Golden Globe nomination. I hope the same thing doesn't happen come SAG and Oscar time...Just to let you know, if you don't already, this is a story about love...ridiculous, undying, unabashed, uncompromising, indescribable, REAL love. It is such a revelation and a breath of fresh air for PEOPLE in general today, let alone a gay man like myself. Make sure you are confident in the love that you have for your partner, if you have one, as this will make you think and LONG for that kind of love...What a heart-breaking and AMAZING film!

There struggles and torment endure through there rocky long distance relationship further pulled me into the film even more. Whiles watching the film I have to say Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal effortless performances felt real and not focused at all.

However, there were some interesting aspects of it that just didn't seem very realistic (maybe they weren't supposed to be). For instance, both guys were supposed to be poor, yet they were wearing very nice, fashionable clothing. I felt like this was some American Eagle commercial with all the nice denim and pretty shirts to match their pants, not to say the jackets. At other times, it almost felt like the movie was some Malboro commercial. It was a much too rough a job and the conditions were much too hard for two such clean cut, pretty boys to be around. Also, I understand that Heath Ledger was supposed to be ""a man of few words"", but I had a lot of trouble understanding what he was saying, and at many times I felt as if he wasn't doing much of the acting. On the other hand, Jake seemed to be more the main character than Heath Ledger was. He always initiated everything, and seemed to be more of a central character. He also spoke more clearly. But this movie was great for other reasons. First of all, this movie is NOT about gay people. I hope that people who think this movie is purely about 2 gay guys will go see this movie so that they can realize that the love portrayed could equally exist between people of the opposite sex as well.It is about ""selfish love"", emotional, obsessive, love that makes a mess of things.Surrounded by the despair of the little, ugly towns of America (in those times), the lack of jobs, and the simple, boring lifestyles, the mountain trips provided something completely opposite. Brokeback mountain was beautiful and true and it seemed as if the boys longed for something deep and true, and once they found that, it was hard for them to let go. However touching their story was, it was also marked by tragedy in that they both had to live ""double lives"" and never could really be with each other longer than a few days. All in all I enjoyed this movie and I recommend it to others. I thought it was carefully made and it got that feeling of loneliness and longing across very well. Afterall, if a movie can invoke such strong feelings about love, or sadness, or lust, or loneliness, then it has achieved its goal and became a great movie that is both believable and sensitive. The scene with the shirts did not impress me as much as it impressed others. The most touching scene in the movie for me was the one when they see each other for the first time in 4 years, and they start kissing right behind the wall. I thought that was a very powerful scene.",Brokeback Mountain
646,jau-zeng,Banned in Malaysia/China but Still Amazing,10,4 February 2006,"I have been following the ""hype"" of this movie since day one and once I heard of its release, I was really looking forward to seeing it. First, because I'm a gay man who is in a closeted situation in a conservative society and second, because I have read the magnificent short story and the characters grow after each reading.I was very disappointed (but not at all surprised) that this film was not picked up to be distributed in Malaysia due to its themes. I always found it mind-numbing that violent movies or movies with themes about assassination (ie. Munich) is acceptable in a peaceful Muslim country but a movie about love between two people (and a powerful one at that) is censored. I bring this up because the distributor said that themes in Munich would be more acceptable in a Muslim society but homosexuality is a no-go. I think that releasing this film would help bring some understanding and maturity to the subject.So, I have to confess that I viewed this film on a pirated disc (which is one of the ways to see films in Malaysia - good or bad) but I do have the full intention of buying the DVD from Amazon when it comes out as well as see it in a theatre overseas sometime if I have the chance. The film is more than I expected it to be and I already had high expectations of it. Heath Ledger has grown so much as an actor and gives one of the most touching performances I have seen for a long time. Jake is beautiful as the frustrated and occasionally angry at the sorry situation that their in. My hat also goes off to the supporting cast, namely Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway who portray the sad, suspecting wives to perfection.Everything about this film, from the precise direction from Ang Lee and the 1997 script by Larry McMurty and Diana Ossana to the breathtaking cinematography of Wyoming by Rodrigo Prieto and the music by Rodrigo Prieto is balanced so well. This movie will leave a haunting memory of what could have and yet couldn't have been for Ennis and Jack. More than highly recommended.",Brokeback Mountain
647,Matthew-WH,Great film,9,15 August 2015,"I watched Brokeback Mountain a year after it came out at 14 years of age and i didn't enjoy the film. I thought it was slow, boring and i thought that the film lacked in passionate scenes with the two leads, there were no ' i love you's'. The film wasn't blatant in its message, they didn't say things just to set up the story, we weren't given the answers in a neat and tidy bow. Watching it now at 23, i can see now what i could not see then, being so young, a film that is absolutely beautiful. Not boring at all, intriguing, heartbreaking and full of wonderful performances by Heath, Jake, Michelle and Anne. All the scenes between Heath and Jake, they feel so real because they are not given abundant amounts of dialog that treat the audience like they need guidance. We are given brief moments, that to be honest i wanted more from, that not much is said but it is defiantly clear that these two mens hearts are breaking for each other. It is love without having to say it, without having to fall into cinematic clichés of how to represent love on screen. Heath and Jake had a wonderful chemistry, it was so believable. One of the most heartbreaking scenes is when Alma (Williams) sees Ennis (Ledger) kissing Jack (Gyllenhaal). This scene to me paints a perfect picture of the time and especially in the south. So many men that were gay were doing what they had to do to fit in and it is not at all fair on their wives and children but you have to blame society. I love the raw nature of this film, no moments felt forced, no scenes were wasted, it is a brilliant film. To see Heath Ledger look so damn beautiful and portray a wonderful performance, it really makes me sad that he is gone. He definitely left a wonderful legacy of films behind him and Brokeback Mountain is one of his best.",Brokeback Mountain
648,djhuckel,Two Cowboys Went up a Mountain...,6,27 February 2006,"By now you likely know the basic premise or something of Brokeback Mountain, i.e. It's about two gay cowboys. Well sort of.Another story taken from E. Annie Proulx short tale is made into an epic film about Ennis Del Mar, played by Heath Ledger, and Jack Twist, by Jake Gyllenhaal, who are two cowboy guys. They meet while being employed by Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid). Their job is to herd sheep, well fatten them up on public land on the quiet 'up on Brokeback Mountain' ready for sale the next season.While on the job for so many months together alone the usually quiet Ennis opens up to the more talkative, sometimes rodeo rider, Jack Twist. The landscape is beautiful, from the opening shot though it's the everyday for them. After one particular conversation (Jack: thats the most you have talked in these months', Ennis: 'it's the most I've talked in years') and the ubiquitous rum, Jack is more amorous and a little forceful. One thing leads to another This tale meanders across 20-30 years. After this encounter, the two fall into a lifelong addiction for each other, both afflicted in different ways. Both marry but Ennis still secretly pines for Jack & Jack pines back. But if Jack cant have Ennis then what else is there? Their infrequent encounters become less infrequent until Brokeback Mountain is held in high esteem by many and seen as not so good by many. It was a little of both for me. It's a long tale that took its sweet time looking at the great scenery as it goes, watching the life of Jack & Ennis take its ups & downs, and maybe it is a bit long for me. Check it out if you want an experience.Someone I know would tell you 'it got 8/10 on www.IMDb.com' but I will only give it 6.5/10",Brokeback Mountain
649,bilweeler,"""Love is a force of nature.""",9,5 January 2006,"As almost anyone who follows films knows, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a love story. A gay cowboy love story. And those who follow the movie hype know this one comes with critical acclaim and lots of buzz. So much buzz, in fact, that I decided that I had to see this one in a MOVIE THEATER to see what all the buzz is about. (The last film I actually went to a theater to see was ""Batman Begins,"" so you know how often this happens.) My fear with films that have a lot of advance buzz is that they cannot possibly live up to the hype. Time after time, I come away disappointed because the film cannot possibly live up to the expectations that have been set for it. I went to ""Brokeback Mountain"" expecting to be disappointed.But I wasn't. Not disappointed. Not even slightly let down. The hype is not really ""hype."" It's all true. This film is visually beautiful, thematically challenging, and extremely well crafted. Except for homophobes and religious fundamentalists, this film will engage you, challenge you, and ultimately touch your life. This is a love story, but remember this: not all love stories have happy endings. This love story left me feeling profoundly sad...not because it's a tear jerker, but because it is a brutally honest film. It shows both the romantic and the tragic sides of love. And whether the lovers are two men, two women, or a mixture of both, the message is the same. Love is complicated, and it doesn't matter who the lovers are. When the forces of nature take over, there is nothing we can do to change the outcome.This film is brutally honest because it coldly shows the consequences of a love that cannot exist. Consequences for the lovers. Consequences for the spouses of those lovers. Consequences for the children of those lovers. And consequences for their parents. All delicately acted, scripted, and executed.The cowboys have a forbidden love, and they cannot come out of the closet. When Jack Twist suggests that they could get a ranch and live together forever, Ennis Del Mar knows better. His reply:""If ya can't fix it, Jack, ya gotta stand it.""That about sums it up. Jack can't fix the fact that gay cowboys who come out have a very short life span. The better solution is to deny it, stuff it, hide it. What Ennis doesn't say, but everyone knows, is that if you deny your nature, eventually you will wind up an empty, broken vessel. It's all here. Stunningly beautiful mountain scenery. The tender love story. The stark reality that cowboys are NOT allowed to be openly gay. The innocent wives and children whose lives are forever changed by Jack and Ennis. But there's one thing I expected that I didn't find in this film: an agenda. It doesn't glorify homosexuality. It doesn't condemn it. It just shows it, with all the emotional peaks and valleys like in every love story. And it shows the wreckage left along the way. The acting, including Guyllenhall and Ledger, is first rate. Michelle Williams is wonderful as Alma Del Mar. And Kate Mara as Alma Del Mar has an uncanny resemblance to her screen mother.Can this film change the world? Probably not. The vast majority of the audience will probably be individuals who are open to improving the status of homosexuals. Very few films change the world. Some do however, change the audience a little bit. This is one of those films.FINAL RATING: 4.5 Stars (out of 5 possible)See this one. You'll be glad you did.",Brokeback Mountain
650,maurice_84,Classic in every sense.,9,5 February 2006,"Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a classic, both in terms of film and literature. Annie Proulx's short story is followed almost perfectly--with two non-essential scenes added by the screenwriters--and this adds to the strength of the elliptical dialogue. What makes this a classic? First, like any Greek tragedy, the story revolves around two ""star-crossed"" lovers whose fate involves not only their lives, but also the larger culture in which they attempt to negotiate irreconcilable desires. The sub-text of ""Brokeback"" is the vanishing American West and all that it symbolizes. As with Cormac McCarthy's ""Border Trilogy"", the story of these two men is played out over time, and the audience sees both the slow downward spiral of Jake and Ennis and the gradual commercialization of the West. In the Edenic world where the two men meet, the audience sees pure blue skies, ranging grasslands, powerful mountain ranges, horses, sheep, campfires--in short, an idyllic setting worthy of Homer. In the ""real"" lives of the men, horses are replaced with trucks, rodeos with television football, whiskey with pot, and the classic intimacy of tents with the bleakness of trailers.The film is also classic in that it mirrors many of John Ford's westerns. Profound and painful close-ups alternate with equally profound shots of the natural world. Heath Ledger's unarticulated pain and anger reach a tragic climax only once in the film. And this scene--Ennis' emotional ""showdown"" with Jack--marks the heartbreaking slide of the plot into its bleak denouement. It's a John Wayne movie without the Duke, and the absence of this icon of impossibly romantic machismo is yet another source of invisible power that makes this film one for the ages.",Brokeback Mountain
651,richardv-johnson,inescapable perfection,10,28 December 2005,"There couldn't be a more perfect adaptation of a short story than this. Annie Proulx said seeing the film made her feel like she needed an exorcist. What's missing is a few snippets of graphic sexuality which no one would complain about, and a few moments of self-awareness that give Ennis and Jack just a little more depth in the story. The only problem I have is with what's added - the emphasis on the unloved women. That's very small in the story, very big in the movie. Viewed from the women's point of view, this becomes like a Carson McCullers tale where everyone loves what they can't have (Reflections in a Golden Eye with Marlon Brando lusting after Robert Forster lusting after Elizabeth Taylor having an affair with Brian Keith married to Julie Harris who seems to care only for the fey Filipino houseboy). But Ennis and Jack aren't totally denied happiness, it's just restricted. And Alma and Lureen seem like ladies who can take care of themselves.",Brokeback Mountain

653,mastbradped,One of the Best!,10,4 February 2006,"I just saw it alone last night and am glad I did! My friend saw it alone and said he experienced it better emotionally so I'm glad I did that as well! I am still haunted by the movie, couldn't sleep last night and, when I left the theater, I had chills and had to take a few hours to process what I had seen! All of the characters in this film are wanting to be loved and something keeps it at a distance from them! Even Lureen wants love, even though she comes across as a cold, businesswoman! I identified the most with Jack, simply because he would do anything on Earth to be with the man he loves, drive across State borders for countless hours, just to have a few days or a week with Ennis! I would do the same thing for the man I love, give him everything I have emotionally and spiritually and hope that he one day takes it from me and gives it back to me! I can relate to Jack big time and my favorite 2 scenes in the movie are: 1: When he leaves Ennis after he surprises him and he chooses his daughters and Jack drives away crying. That scene is so touching and telling that he wants so desperately to be with him but he can't, either because of the time, family or other people.2. I also love the scene where Ennis drives away, actually the last time they see each other, and Jack flashes back to 20 years earlier when he rode off to go up and tend the sheep. A simpler time where the 2 of them were undisturbed and together.I really felt for Alma when she discovered the 2 of them kissing and loved Michelle Williams in the role! Great, great, poignant film!",Brokeback Mountain
654,bearian,Absolutely wonderful,10,12 December 2005,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in years, and the best this year. The mother of all Oscar buzz clichés. The acting and direction is fine. I have to agree with a lot of the posters on this site.I saw it with two very long-time friends on December 11. They didn't cry, but I had to break out the hankies. I have been an emotional wreck since watching this, and even read the story in the New Yorker archives.I want to add a few ideas of my own. (Warning - major spoilers!) There is a lot of religious symbolism. For example, religion suffuses Jake's and Ennis's lives, but they are so uneducated. They don't even know what the Pentecost is. Ennis refuses to go to a church social. The use of a rose (""stem the rose"") in the movie is interesting -- liturgical symbolism of penance and joy combined. Jacob's name means Twist -- the actor's first name is a literal translation of his character's last name. Even DelMar -- from the sea -- evokes drowning, perhaps the drowning of Jake in his own blood.I really started to cry when Ennis started to cry into the shirts in the closet -- closets are for clothes, not people! -- oh I started to sob.If you haven't seen this, you must go. And read the story.",Brokeback Mountain
655,SeverityOne,Rather overrated,6,6 March 2006,"This review is not going to be the heaps of praise that most other reviewers have given this film. Imagine, just for a moment, that it's not a film about a gay love story, but about a 'straight' love story. What's left?Well, it's a story about two people, spanning several decades. The photography is very well done and the opening shots of the outdoors on Brokeback Mountain are very promising... but somehow, I find it very difficult to feel any sympathy for the main characters. They seem self-centered in their actions, and the anti-gay sentiment is never really made felt. It's also a rather slow film, never picking up anywhere. There's no climax, it just... ambles on.In my opinion, the subject matter (which I can only praise, and about which there should be a lot more films) got the better of the perception of Brokeback Mountain. It's not a bad film, not in the least, but a masterpiece? No.In this light, I'm not surprised that it didn't score nearly as well at the Academy Awards as was thought beforehand.However, it does deserve praise for tackling a subject which is still very contentious in the more conservative areas of the world, and for being a film with originality. After all the rehashes, adaptations and sequels, that *is* a relief.",Brokeback Mountain
656,gweatherford,"Fine Observation Is An Acquired Taste - So, Then, Is This Film",9,26 December 2005,"I read many of the negative comments about this film, and I can understand them. What many see as ""boring,"" however, I tend to admire. I prefer what I call ""quiet heartbreak"" films to the paint by numbers variety we so often get. I prefer accumulated details and quiet observation to lightning epiphany and voice-over explanation of things I prefer to figure out on my own. So yes. the movie runs slowly... however the initial scenes build slowly to show the little things that make these two like each other; and if you blink, you'll miss the keen observations that are not accompanied by the swelling score or a close-up of a teardrop on a cheek: Ennis watching Jack with curiosity and interest as the other rides his horse up the mountain (a mere blip in the distance on the screen, yet obviously big in this man's mind); Jack trying hard not to look at Ennis as he bathes; Ennis acting as if the loss of money is the reason he is upset about cutting the summer stint short; Jack deflating when he realizes that a trip to see Ennis at his home was wasted. To me, this was much more beautiful than any heavy sex scenes might have been, more indicative of strong feelings than any screenwriter-imposed proclamations might have been.I also love that the women in the film got fair coverage; and Linda Cardellini's role, while an add-on to the book, was a nice side note to show that Ennis's interest in Jack was not just a cover-up for lack of marital connection. Her acting actually surprised me; Michelle Williams, heartbreaking as she has been, really anchored that the tragedy of these men's decisions was not just their own to bear. It was really nice to see a movie that showed how this societal urging to hide unpleasant things can have a ripple effect; and it was the women in the film, not the men, who made this truly stand out.In fact, the film seemed to have an interesting message: While same sex feelings are often viewed as irresponsible and selfish, the fact that these men stayed with wives in unhappy lives had a different sort of tragic selfishness behind it. Not that there were many options open (the comment by the Christian who says that these two would have built a life together had their feelings been true smacks of one who does not comprehend the true life of living in marginalized groups); but the refusal of Ennis to even fully admit his feelings to Jack for most of the film had as horrible effect on others as it did on him, mostly due to his refusal to see how this was bound to happen.What is beautiful to me is that these subtleties are not vomited all over the screen, as we so often see in Hollywood. Most of the moments are small, can be missed easily. One review I read said that the men's failings were passed over to make the movie more palatable; and yet Jack sleeping with others and his braggart little white lies hardly qualify as saintly, while Ennis's sexist treatment of his wife was often appalling. What made me appreciate them more is that most of them came in hindsight, in whispers and snippets of a thought that came to me as lay in bed, pondering the quiet subtle provocations of the movie,including the elusive last line of the film, both true to Annie Proulx's source novel and completely, justifiably, enigmatic for the rest of us.",Brokeback Mountain

The work of the two actors is very good, especially Heath Ledger in the personage of Ennis Del Mar. You can see in this personage yours change along the years of relations. He fight in the beginning to change It, and He will married and will have children, but He will be a unhappy man because He fight against his real feeling. He knows that they are happy when they are united, but He is not the sufficiently brave thing.Jack Twist discover too the homosexuality with Ennis I think, and He try too, to change this feeling, this love with the similar strategy like Ennis, but finally He know that He is very unhappy and he must to live with his love Ennis.A movie that has helped me to think about the important things of the life.",Brokeback Mountain

Not a lot of the emotional moments touched me...is it Oscar material? definitely for the performance of Heath Ledger (Ennis Del Mar) but for the director, not sure.I think there are problems with the direction and edition of the movie, or maybe not problems but things that I don't like : the way Ennis learned about Jacks death, there is no emotion there...a shame ... now analyzing both personalities: jack clearly ""is"" gay, he is hungry for feelings and sex and as Ennis doesn't give him enough , he goes elsewhere to find them (male whore in Mexico, cheating on his wife with another woman and maybe even the bearded character,...) Ennis clearly has difficulty in showing and accepting any feelings for jack or other people (his wife, the barmaid,his daughter,..) so all his life he is like waiting for someone, something .The best scene for (emotionnally speaking) is when they met again years after their first encounter.

659,cliffr2k,A review from a straight Christian guy.,9,23 December 2005,"This film let people understand how homosexuality is being force into misery life by the unnecessary prejudice and hatred toward them.It is sad that many people who carry traditional religion beliefs spread hatred against homosexuality.As the current society has problems that need to be focus on such as high divorce rate among heterosexual couple, domestic violence in this world(It hurts me as I see one of the movie review posts that glorifies SAW2 as far more superior movie and enjoyable movie when compare with Brokeback mountain).Despite all these problems, yet people choose to pick up on Homosexuality to go against and to hate. I have great wonderful friends that are homosexual, and know family whose son and daughter are homosexual and yet they are all just like the rest of heterosexuals and they want to love god , but mankind has yet interpret god as hating homosexuality....People of the current world please wake up...!!! Just like we did in the past when we were thinking that women weren't as superior as man, black men weren't doom to be slave (It was interpreted via the bible that way by the European.)

For me the first ten minutes of the movie seemed like twice that. I found this movie to be very boring. Not because of it mostly being dialogue, it was the lack of dialogue.It was written well and was played great by the actors It seems to me that Ang Lee was just trying to show off with most of the landscape shots. For me they seemed to throw off the story and bring me out of the movie. I haven't seen any of Ang Lee's previous films but after this I'm not sure if I want to. I guess what really ruined it for me was the unnecessary landscape shots, I think the audience realizes that they are on a mountain from both the title and the fact they mention it in the film.I thought it was a great idea for a film, I just don't think that they pulled it off, but that's just me.",Brokeback Mountain
661,jickweez-1,Why Ang Lee is a master,10,12 December 2005,"After reading Ms. Proulx's tour-de-force story (only 30 pages), I weeped for the rest of the day. How a writer can capture all five senses of a place and its people so keenly was a magical, near religious experience. Only a few writers have ever been able do this. And only a few directors can recreate this kind of short story into a brilliant, faithful adaptation.Mr. Lee accomplished this feat. The movie, like the written story, is about what isn't said. The silence, the human gestures and Mother Nature Herself tell the real story - the one lurking deep (very deep) below the surface. Lee's attention to detail is mind blowing. At one point early on in Brokeback, the audience sees an extreme static close-up of Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal). In the background, Ennis (Heath) is washing himself. Most directors would have had him steal a glance at the naked man. But Jack holds still, focused on his task at hand. This subtlety is what sets this movie apart from any other love story. It respects the audience, and in turn leads us to highs and lows not experienced in a theater before. I haven't been this emotionally manipulated by a film since Spielberg's The Color Purple.A standing ovation to Lee, Ledger, Gyllenhaal, and the supporting cast (who give some of the most heartbreaking small performances ever filmed). The ""buzz"" is on...",Brokeback Mountain
662,brown19,Remarkable,10,5 February 2006,"Imagine being an individual who is so deeply in love with another individual. Also, take a moment to think about what it would be like to try and deny those feelings for 20 years, but in the end, when the ultimate object of that love is dead to finally realize the true depths and meaning of the feeling.What I described is basically the meaning of (in my opinion) the greatest movie of 2005/2006, Brokeback Mountain. This movie is about two Young ""cowboys"" who meet while doing casual work together during the summer of 1963. Their job involves guarding sheep together high up in the mountain. Eventually, in the one place they least suspect it, they find a mutual attraction that quickly develops into love. This is the beginning of a movie that explores the depths of the human soul. As the years pass, they both get married, and have kids, and try to put on the face of the ""normal life"".Brokeback mountain is the kind of film that evokes such feelings and passion in the viewer that you are left thinking about its message long after the movie is finished. It is a love story that is really powerful in the sense in that the conflicts involved seem so real and you can also feel along with the characters exactly how they feel. I suppose part of this is due to the fact that it speaks to the deepest parts of each of our souls. We can all relate (to some degree) to the feeling of yearning to find someone to spend our lives with, and who will love us unconditionally.The ""love story"" is a theme that is done over and over again in films. To do a ""love story"" usually means the movie will become an instant ""hit"" because it involves young and attractive stars who fall in love and eventually have their ""happy ever after."" Although movies like ""Titanic"" and ""Love Story"" appear to be tragic, in the fact that one of the main lovers dies in the end, in the end they are redemptive and ""feel good movies"" because at least both of the lovers involved are able to acknowledge and accept their love for one another. These movies also have as the covert background ""truth"" that had fate not taken a tragic turn, they really would have been together forever.This is what makes ""Brokeback Mountain""completely different from any other love story that has ever come out in the modern cinema. Many people compare the relationship between Jack and Ennis to that of Romeo and Juliet, and where I do thee the thematic similarities between the two (the lovers who are doomed to never be together), but to me the greatest parallel is with ""Wuthering Heights"" because Jack an Ennis (like Cathy and Heathcliff) are never able to really accept their true love for each other. Jack and Ennis are in such gripping passion for one another, and the movie does an excellent job of showing us that, but they(and the audience as well) knows that they will never ever be together.Really, could a love be more tragic than this? Man, two people who spend years trying to be happy, and trying to find their peace in this world, but who are unable to because of the lives they all have been forced to lead. Truth be told, I went into this movie with preconceived notions about rooting on the two main male characters, but I found that the more I got into it, I really got to sympathize with the wives as well.Every one of the main characters is trying to fulfill social roles while at the same time following their hearts. Its stuff like this that make the final anti-climatic scenes of this movie so much more effective. The way that the ultimate love is discovered and expressed, when it is already too late.I believe that the one ""element""that could make this movie ""redemptive"" is the most tragic moment of all. The end when Ennis discovers just how deep their bond was, and his ultimate regret is the most heart wrenching part of this whole film. The pain that he experiences is expressed most vividly at the end. This movie leaves you (or at least it left me) wanting more. I did not want this to be the final end. So tragic, to live in a crummy trailer in the middle of nowhere dreaming and longing for a perfect life that could have been, but never could have been. Even though it seems like Ennis is coming to terms with just how deep their bond was, and this could be seen as uplifting, to me it was the final curtain on the most beautiful tragedy I have ever seen on film.This film is a must see piece of cinematic art that everyone needs to see. It is a true movie experience that bears witness to the pains and sufferings (and also triumphs) of the human soul. One warning though, you will most likely find your heart breaking in sympathy for the main characters. This is not a film for someone looking for a happy film, and you will most likely leave it with sadness, but I believe it is a necessary sadness.",Brokeback Mountain
663,marioncap,"Heartbreaking romance, one for the ages",9,28 January 2006,"This beautiful, difficult film depicts the love between two tender-hearted, emotionally deprived, educationally limited, fearful and bottled-up men who quite accidentally find each other -- and in each other, the love and joy of their lives -- during a hardscrabble teenaged summer herding sheep on Brokeback Mountain, WY.Since this is the rural American heartland, ca. 1963, neither of them even imagines the possibility of living a different life from what they've always known; they experience their first encounter as a one-time aberration, only to find out, much too late, that their deep joy and delight in each other's presence really is love, and they should never have married their unhappy wives just because marriage after a certain age was expected.The tragic content of the film resonates with the real-life murder, not too long ago, of a young gay man in Wyoming (Matthew Shephard), and this resonance enhances the power of the film.Best moments: Ennis' farewell to Jack's mother, with Ennis' old shirt in the brown paper bag; Ennis & Jack on Brokeback Mountain, lying side by side under the vast starlit sky -- Ennis says: ""I'm just sayin' a little prayer of thanks."" Jack asks ""For what?"" and Ennis replies, with a complicated smile, ""For you forgettin' that damn harmonica, for the peace and quiet.""",Brokeback Mountain

That's a compliment :) I thought the film is tremendous. One of my favorites that came out relatively not too many years ago. Some others are City of God; The Last King of Scotland; and Drive.I must say I watched Brokeback Mountain a while ago, and only recently started reviewing here, so I can't go into as much detail as some others here are doing on this film and neither do I much like that. I just want to point out to potential viewers that I highly recommend this one and they can, if they are of the opinion as me, check out some other films I think are ... superb.Anyways, acting in the film is top. Cinematography, poignancy, depth, all excellent. I don't remember much of the soundtrack, alas.All in all, a gem of a film.It was either due to Jake Gyllenhaal's performance in Brokeback Mountain, that I finally went out to see Donnie Darko (2001) or the other way around, but I have to say the guy has already appeared in quite a few notable films. Don't miss out on DD, October Sky (1999), Zodiac (2007).",Brokeback Mountain
665,wangdichaoyang,Thank you for your harmonica,10,9 August 2013,"I saw this film the first time when I was still in primary school. One of my parents (I don't know which) bought a bootleg DVD and kept it on the DVD player. One night they went out for a walk and I went through the DVDs and found this movie. At the time I was so afraid that my parents would come back at any second so I jumped through the film and saw the scene which Ennis and Jack first had sex. And now I am 18 years old. And this is the first time I see the whole thing. I don't want to say something critical about the film, because I want to leave it as it is in my mind. When I was a child I paid all my attention to that sex scene. (I haven't seen any thing about sex of two men ever at that time. It was a few years later that I saw a gay sex picture for the first time on a porn website.) But this time the film to me is all about the story, the relationship. I don't often get emotional because every time I cried as a child my father would yell at me like a mad person. As a result I don't have the ability to cry watching touching TV plays or movies. In the scene which the two people turned old and no one felt happy enough and blamed it on this relationship, I felt so much that I almost cried. (The two times I actually cried were Clapham Junction, when the young man in white enticed the fat person for his violence desire. And In The Flesh, when the history is revealed in the last episode in that cave.) What I can say about this film is the scenery is beautiful. And the story, how can I describe my feeling about this story... It make me believe that everything really happened. It's like if I go there I can see their old fireplace left in the mountains near the stream. I don't feel so sad that Jack died. I only feel so happy for them because they had what they had. Last year something happened to me that made me understand all the homophobic elements in movies and on TV screen. (I want to add here that my father said his was disgusted watching this movie, and he watched this movie.)I think as I experience more as I grow older I would understand more about this movie, about the death of Jack and the ending which everyone else seems to feel so strongly about. I watched the other film that Ang Lee made, The Wedding Banquet. The story had the same fierceness. But this time around the acting is better and the story seems more pure. Every time I see something about Heath Ledger I feel sad. And I always feel like I am not important enough to say something about it. I feel self-consciously uncomfortable every time I say that I like Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. One day I saw a video, the Oprah Show about Brokeback Mountain. And the two of them sat there. And I shouldn't say this but they seemed great sitting together. And that is just something wrong in my own private mind. Hope everything turns out fine and I will see this film again some years later.",Brokeback Mountain

It's the gay Easy Rider!,10,6 February 2006,"After the first 10 minutes i feared the worst for this film: the kinda gay drama you've seen a million times before with struggles about coming to terms with homosexuality and lingering shots of naked men by streams. Luckily it got better and turned into a nice understated drama with a lightness of touch I didn't expect. Like Easy Rider, it's Rednecks oppressing a couple of 'weirdos', with lots of beautiful nature shots thrown in and a struggle for the inner soul. But they're not smuggling drugs, they're smuggling homosexuality! You don't have to be gay to enjoy this film. I'm not gay and neither is my flatmate Tobias but we enjoyed it. And so did Malin but she is gay. I wouldn't give it 10 normally, probably 7, but I only give films 10 or 1 so I had to give it 10.",Brokeback Mountain

This is a story of 2 cowboys falling in love unexpectedly yet their love lasted forever. Ang Lee did an amazing job in telling this story. When you watch the movie, you feel that you are one of their friends watching how their love blossoms and how it goes thru the ups and downs. Thumbs to all actors and actresses. Heath and Jake were amazing. They never say I love you to each other yet their eyes are full of emotions of love. Sadly, they never end up with each other. Once you see this movie, you can't help wonder how can something so beautiful as true love between 2 human beings be so wrong in the society's eyes! Love is love. Who cares it is the same sex or not! The movie described well how the homosexuals are prejudiced in this movie and it is still the same in this reality world. I think this movie really inspire people to think and encourage one to face with true self. It is sort of a wake up call to the society not to place any more unnecessary prejudices against homosexuality. The acting is great. The scenery is beautiful. The plots are well played out. It is so good to see a movie like this. Strongly recommend it.",Brokeback Mountain

669,mervei,Sensitive and Inhibited LOVE between two men,10,6 March 2006,"BBM is truly a sensitive movie. It makes sense with the general look on Ang Lee's face. i firstly could not figure out why Jack suddenly got intimate with Ennis by putting his arm around his body in the tent.Because until then the conversation between them did not seem to be that much warm. However, as the story unfolds itself, it made me believe that there is a very passionate love between them and especially at the union and the shirt scene were quite touching. It was a very sad ending and made me CRY! and think of how love can be that much strong just like the one in ""Angels in America""Finally, i must say that this film will not be forgotten not because it freely tells about two men's secret relationship in a world where most of the people say that is wrong, but because it reveals love in a much sensitive way than the other films where the love is between a man and a woman. congratulations to Ang Lee.",Brokeback Mountain
670,bethlambert117,Two Men In Love at the Venice Film Festival,10,3 September 2005,"It was a real ordeal to get into the screening. The anticipation was palpable. The film arrived surrounded by a plethora of innuendo. ""A gay western"" ""Heath and Jake's hot scenes"" As soon as the film started every imaginable preconception flew out of the auditorium. This is a remarkable, moving and powerful love story. The setting is that of a modern western ""The Last Picture Show"" comes to mind. Ang Lee's attention to detail verges on science fiction. You can actually smell the place. Extraordinary. I'm not going to reveal anything about the story - Gian Luigi Rondi a legendary Italian film critic, revealed the ending to a television audience, what was he thinking?! - The film will be enjoyed much more allowing the story to unfold without having passages underlined and attention drawn to this or that particular. I felt compelled to write this comment because I'm overwhelmed. It has changed my perception, I must confess, about certain aspect of same sex love because I didn't think of same sex when I was watching it, I saw two human beings (amazing performances by both actors)I have the feeling ""Brokeback Mountain"" will make history, deservedly so.",Brokeback Mountain
671,hundredacrefilms,Scaling the heights and depths of human love by Thomas J. O'Connor,8,16 December 2005,"On the website for ""Brokeback Mountain"" an anonymous man from Atlanta writes, ""It would seem that after 14 years of marriage to a women I love endlessly, my father's death, three career changes and twenty two years that I should be able to press onward, and thought I had, but I haven't. I wept uncontrollably after watching this film....and I can't watch it again, because it is too painful...however, thank you for the film. It touches a chord that nothing else has."" His is one of a score of intimate portraits featured on the site. It is apparent that this seemly unique love story is not as uncommon or shocking as one might think.At this time, anticipation for the film version of ""Brokeback Mountain,"" referred to unjustly by many as ""the gay cowboy movie,"" has reached near fever pitch with already 7 Golden Globe nominations. Such early accolades can be a blessing and a curse, as there now exists the potential for the film to be over-hyped, thereby lessening its quiet dramatic impact, as was the case for me. Still, it is undeniably an important film, one that has the potential to bridge the gap between the homophobic intellect and the unbiased heart. Not only is ""Brokeback Mountain"" a story of a deep love between two men, but of those who share in their lives yet exist at the edges, their spouses and their children, aching as much for a connection with them as the main character's do for each other.Well into the film, when Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) reunite four years after an intimate summer as sheepherders in the majestic Wyoming mountains, they abandon any sense of their surroundings, quickly indulging in passionate kisses, witnessed unbeknownst to them by Ennis' wife Alma (Michelle Williams). At the screening I attended, the audience reaction to the Alma's discovery was one of laughter, perhaps relieving any tensions the story may have built up to that point. But for me the laughter was odd. Watching a woman discover something so foreign to what she has understood her relationship with her husband to be is understandably painful. As Ennis quickly introduces Jack to Alma he simultaneously grabs his jacket and informs her not to wait up for him as they most likely will be out all night drinking and he's out the door. Alma remains in the quiet of her kitchen. She is gradually overcome by confusion and sadness after having witnessed the most pep in her husband's step in a long time. It is at this point that the movie emerges beyond the simplicity of it's gay identity to broader themes, among them fear and regret.""Brokeback Mountain"" is an extremely well crafted movie all around. The Wyoming landscape (which here is actually Alberta, British Columbia) is as stunning and impressive as is its uniformly skilled cast. While watching the film one gets the feeling that they are witness to a part of cinematic history. At times you could hear a pin drop in the auditorium.Adrian of Sydney, Australia, another website visitor, sums up quite nicely the role this film can have in peoples lives. He writes, ""it is a powerfully honest look at the most profound sort of connection you can have with another human being -- the sort of connection which defies categorization, the sort of connection which seems to re-write the way we need to look at ourselves.""",Brokeback Mountain

I left the cinema feeling as if I have LIVED the film rather than simply watching it. Critics have said that it started slowly, but then picked up the pace, however, I find that its true to life feel needed that sequence, no human story begins, progresses and ends at the same pace.

Maybe because so many small tales are hidden in the acting and storyboard that you are not able to cope with them all until long after you leave the cinema.

677,alvoalvo,Is Brokeback Mountain really part of a pro-gay agenda?,9,2 January 2006,"I just got back from seeing Brokeback Mountain a few hours ago, and I have to admit that the acting was absolutely fantastic. Especially Heath Ledger. His performance, along with the scenery, are my favorite aspects of the movie.For me, I thought the movie was more about class and loneliness, rather than pushing some sort of ""gay agenda,"" whatever that means. Brokeback Mountain was set in Wyoming and Texas in the sixties, prior to the advent of identity politics. If you notice, Ennis and Jack both admit after having sex that neither one of them are ""queer,"" at a time when that word had overwhelmingly negative connotations. They didn't see themselves as part of a culture or underclass. They were simply alone-together.My favorite part of the movie was the first 30 minutes when they both meet and worked as sheep-herders. The work they had to do was back-breaking, dangerous, fascinating, and lonely. So perhaps as a result, they gravitated towards each other.And it seemed to me that the main reason Ennis couldn't spend more time with Jack was because he had to earn a living. Ennis couldn't move to Texis or Mexico with Jack Twist because he wouldn't be in a position to take care of himself. For me, that is why the movie is so sad---that the economic and social demands of their families kept them apart just as much (if not more) than the fear of homophobic attacks. That's why Ennis and Jack only had Brokeback Mountain!",Brokeback Mountain

680,therockin_rooster,No Oscar and for good reason,3,13 January 2008,"Ang Lee attempted and failed to direct an Oscar worthy contender.I watched this film after the Oscar awards. So when it didn't win on Oscar night, and I heard the talk the next day on the radio about what an upset that was, I could not comment one way or the other. But now, having seen it a couple of times, in my opinion, this film was much too flawed to even be a contender. I think the only reason it was even nominated was merely political since it was labeled a ""ground breaking"" film.The first and most obvious problem was the lead acting. Jake Gylenhaal and Heath Ledger had no business starring in this film. How they made it past the screen tests into the movie is beyond me. They have no on-screen chemistry whatsoever. They severely lack passion for each other and the ""love scenes"" look and feel forced as well as awkward. I have seen both of these actors in previous roles. Jake in ""The Good Girl"" and Heath in ""A Knight's Tale"" in which both performances were well above average and deserved notice. Not this time though I'm afraid.However, the supporting roles of Ann Hathaway and especially Michelle Williams are brilliant! And notable mention Randy Quaid as well.The second problem was the story telling itself. Again, I was not swayed to believe much of anything going on or that I should even care. Ang Lee failed to capture the emotion of a scene multiple times. For instance, when Heath begins to cry after they first part ways when coming off the mountain, is this because he knows he will miss Jack or is it because he is ashamed of what he's done? Same with the scene between Ennis and Elma in bed when they realize their marriage is not working, the scene falls flat on it's face. Those are simply a couple of examples of the many plot holes and empty story telling that Ang Lee has failed to fulfill.Overall, I would say this film is worth a look. And on some level, is slightly entertaining. It is however, not at all worth the hype and acclaim that it has received.",Brokeback Mountain
681,iscariot-1,"Great directing, good actors, lousy story",6,27 January 2007,"THere's been a lot of talk about ""Crash"" winning best picture and how the academy awarded it out of homophobia. Frankly, I can see why they would award it to that picture over Brokeback Mountain.Brokeback Mountain is a good film. Brokeback Mountain won Ang Lee the award for best director and he definitely deserved it. However, I found the story itself to be downright depressing. Both Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger are great in their respective roles, and so are the actresses that play their wives. I'll go as far as saying that the acting in this is wonderful, especially on the part of Ledger.However, the short story and the script are both very, very depressing. The film goes from racy to just plain sad through the film, ending with the final shot at the end. Were this a story about a man and a woman or a woman and a woman I would be writing the same thing. If anything this film is saying ""homosexuality leads to sorrow"" which is especially sad. I know several homosexual couples where this is the exact opposite. I wouldn't really praise this as Hollywood's coming out. It's more like a well dressed gay bash.",Brokeback Mountain
682,Scotty7777,Heartbreaking and utterly riveting,10,27 December 2005,"If someone had told me that the love story between two men would become one of my favorite tragic romantic tales of all time, I never would have believed them. But here I am writing a review for just such a movie and I would have to say that this is one of the most memorable love stories I have ever seen on film. Part of what makes this movie so compelling is the acting...Gyllenhaal and Ledger are amazing in these roles. Both men convey nuances of feeling with a look, a gesture, a stance....I've never seen anything quite like it. I have seen both men in other films and, for me, what makes a particularly good actor is that none of their roles seems the same. I would have to say that this is particularly true of these two actors. I had seen Gyllenhall in Day After Tomorrow, October Sky and The Good Girl...none of those roles has an iota in common with this one (and yet I enjoyed all these performances). Perhaps in this film I see a touch of the same character that Ledger created for Ned Kelley, but this is a complete divergence from Casanova (which I saw the next day), The Patriot or A Knight's Tale. Both of these men, in my opinion, are worthy contenders for Oscar nominations for their work in this film.The writing for this film was amazing as well. The dialog was succinct and realistic. The other characters were true to life...unfortunately. Would that real life were not so true to the world portrayed in this film. Perhaps sensitively told stories like this one will serve to help change that world by showing people that love between two people doesn't depend on anything except the state of the heart and the joy and intimacy shared between them.",Brokeback Mountain
683,Cannibully,a damn good love story,10,18 June 2006,"Let me start by saying that I was truly touched by this movie. I went into it with all the preconceived, homophobic notions with which most guys watch this movie, or refuse to watch it as the case may be. But it really surprised me. This is not a movie about homosexuality or gay cowboys eating pudding. This is a movie about love. This movie puts a face on it that not all of us are used to seeing or willing to accept. But it is about love in its truest form, nonetheless.Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis (Heath Ledger) are two people who happen to find each other and happen to fall in love. But this is in 1963 and their love is not something that society is ready to accept. So, naturally, they deny themselves. They manage to sneak away to see each other two or three times a year over the course of over twenty years. They are never able to fully give themselves to each other. In fact, they both have wives and children.Ennis seems to play the role of ""the man"" in this relationship, but it is Jack who is more of a man than Ennis will ever be. Jack comes to terms with his sexuality and wants to take the necessary steps to spend his life with the person he loves. Ennis, on the other hand, ""ain't queer"" and wants no part of it. Of course, he wishes he could spend his life with Jack but he's more concerned about what people will think. He tells Jack the story of a gay couple in his town when he was a young boy. One of them was murdered and left in a ditch, presumably because he was gay. Ennis is certain that this is what would happen to them if they were open about their relationship.Eventually, Jack ends up dead. Ennis finds out a while after the fact. He chose not to spend his life with Jack, so no one ever knows that he should be told that he is dead. Jack's wife gives him some story about how he died, but Ennis knows she is lying. He somehow knows that Jack was murdered, much in the same way as the man from his childhood. Ennis is a tragic character that ends up very much alone and very bitter. He thought he made the wise choice in not living with Jack. But his worst fear came true anyway. Now, instead of a lifetime of memories with the person he loves to comfort him, he is left with nothing but regret.As I said, this movie touched me. This is not about ""gays"" or ""alternative lifestyles"" or whatever other label you care to put on it. It's about two people who love each other. If this is not a personification of love that you are comfortable with, then maybe this isn't the movie for you. If you think watching and *gasp* enjoying this movie makes you or anyone else gay, than you would probably be better off watching Die Hard and Barb Wire whilst eating your Texas Double Whopper and reveling in your manliness.",Brokeback Mountain
684,Thelightbulb,Simply a great love story,9,29 March 2006,"When I came round to watching this film my fear was that this would simply be an average love story that had been massively over-hyped because of the star cast and of course the homo-sexuality that had caused so much controversy. Thankfully this fear turned out to be unfounded as this is in fact a beautiful film. Brokeback Mountain boasts a wonderful story, breathtaking scenery and above all a magnificent cast. While all actors and actresses do a wonderful job in portraying the story of two gay cowboys kept apart by the necessity to live a ""normal"" life, it is Heath Ledger who shines above all else in this film. The heart of this film lies in the dilemma that Ernis Del Mar (Ledger) has to face, one life he cannot allow, his love for Jack Twist (Gyllenhall), and the other life, that of a family man, he is not really made for. Ledger is virtually unrecognisable from the pretty boy characters he normally portrays, as he grabs the audiences hearts with his not-so-bright, rugged Texan character, struggling to come to terms with his dual life. Jake Gyllenhall is excellent also, while Ann Hathaway goes along way to prove she is truly an actress of tremendous ability and shake of her teen actress past. Director Ang Lee does a tremendous job of creating a wonderful love story without sensationalising the home-sexuality of Twist and Del Mar. Instead this film is about the love of two human being for each other with a story that put Brokeback Mountain up there with the best romantic films ever made. This film deserves to be viewed as such and not as a bi-polarised political statement pitting ""Liberal"" Hollywood against the bible bashers.",Brokeback Mountain
685,Bambikilled,I pity those who can not see,10,6 April 2011,"I just wrote a very long piece, trying to point out where the ones throwing dirt at this movie, were wrong. A long and upset monologue, educative, knowitall blabbering. Then it just hit me, a minute ago - they won't get it anyway. They will never get it. They are either homophobes, ignorant, not too bright, or does simply not have the emotional nor connoisseur skills to comprehend a piece of art when they see it. It's not boring, it's not full of padding. The story is not thin nor confusing at all. It's not a gay movie and it's not over hyped. It's even better than the hype says. You just don't see.So instead I turn to the ones who do see. I can't say much more than you've already said, and I mostly wanted to just add my voice to the unison - this is indeed one of the finest movies ever made. It is perfection in the art of movie-making if I ever seen one. And such a hard story to bring to life, to boot.Breathtaking acting from all involved but especially of course Gyllenhaal & Ledger who have a chemistry and talent that sends chills down ones spine, artful and beautiful editing, brilliant directing from perfectionist Lee, hauntingly beautiful score and photo, just... wow. A slow paced, detailed peek through a window into the lives of a bunch of miserable people, all tied together (and damned) by the love between Ennis and Jack. Raw and chose free, the story is served, for interpretation of the viewer. Someone not observant will probably miss a lot, because this is a work of precision. The absolute heart and core of this movie is shown not in words, leading scenes nor ready to serve statements, but in the glances between Ennis and Jack, and their subtle but mountain moving role interpretations. I could talk forever, but never mind. Just watch it for yourselves. To date I have seen it sixteen times, and I will probably see it another one hundred and sixteen times. I just can't get enough. As a movie freak this is total cinematographic climax - it just doesn't get any better than this. And also because Ennis and Jack haunt me as well as you. They make me think, they make me heartbroken, but also so incredibly happy. For the cynical misanthrope I am, a bittersweet comfort and reassurance of the possible happiness of life, I guess.

I will say to begin with that as a red-blooded and heterosexual male, it was difficult to get up the muster to watch this movie. But somehow I managed.I thought that the acting was good but the dialog between the characters was lacking and certainly not what I expected. If you had made this same movie about forbidden love between a black man and white women (or really insert any combination of colors here) - this movie would NEVER have even been talked about let alone win any awards.I'm not gay bashing - not at all. I believe that a movie should win awards and praise based on it's merit and the performance given by the cast and direction given by all of the support staff. Let's face it, this movie received critical acclaim not only because it was about two gay men, but that these gay men happen to be cowboys. That in itself probably wasn't even enough to put it over the top. When you factor in that the US currently has a President from a ""Cowboy"" state and who is perceived as a cowboy and given his stance on gay marriage makes for an interesting juxtaposition between this movie and how Hollywood would like to politicize the actions of the President (even though he is a moron) and his views with how Hollywood would like to see things unfold.My gay friends loved this movie. Not because of the great acting, screenplay, or brilliant camera work. They loved it because they want people to know what it is like being gay in America. Which is great and certainly within their rights to do so but, it doesn't make this a great movie. I'm happy that the movie made a statement but given that as a criteria, Hotel Ruwanda should have swept the Oscars.Open your eyes people, you are being force-fed the politics of the social elite in Hollywood. Based on it's own merit, this film would have ended up in a different Cann...",Brokeback Mountain
687,kingmattress,"Good, but not the milestone it's been built up to be",7,22 February 2006,"Brokeback Mountain is getting a lot of undeserved credit. Don't get me wrong, it was a good movie. It had a good love story. But it's getting a lot of credit as a milestone film, and it doesn't fully deserve it. The acting is incredible, especially on Ledger's part. He does understated very well, and if it weren't for Phillip Seymour-Hoffman's portrayal of a brilliant Truman Capote this year, he'd probably be a shoe-in for the Oscar. The story is where the movie falters. It's good, but it's a standard love story that's made ""special"" because it's gay cowboys. Plus, there are some plot holes. It's good, but probably not worthy of the Oscar it's going to win.",Brokeback Mountain
688,nilsslarss,Reach for the light ... or Jack ... or Jake ...,10,26 March 2006,"I have now seen this film twice and enjoyed it each time. A friend of mine said she was annoyed by the film: she wanted the love story to have a happy ending, and I think that is precisely why this film remains with you afterwards; you keep thinking ""what if ..."". Strangely enough it reminds me of the Dutch film ""Spoorloos"", whose ending with the hero buried alive haunts you for days afterwards. BBM was similar: you feel as though you have witnessed Ennis bury himself alive and you feel suffocated by his insistence on cutting himself off from all his feelings. Days later you keep thinking, why ...It is strange to see what an effect the love of two utter losers (and I really don't use this term pejoratively) can have on so many people watching the film. Despite everything that happens, you go away thinking this is one of the great love stories of the cinema. You keep hoping that Ennis will reach out to the light that is Jack and finally take what will nourish him; but instead he remains in the dark. In the end Jack dies, and Ennis connects his death to the murder from his childhood; I wonder whether this is also not a reflection on the sense of his death: would it not have been better for Jack to have died a death which had meaning (i.e. to die due to his love) than to be the victim of a random accident? If they had lived together, murder might have been the outcome, but death was the outcome anyway. It takes the death of Jack for Ennis to achieve his anagnorisis: at the end he changes his plans because he realizes it is important to make gestures to those you love (here his daughter) and finally at last he can blurt out the heart-rending last line (which still does not manage to articulate the words he needs). Like all good film love stories, the loss is what makes you feel the love. So, a haunting film (but perhaps too easily so). Not my favourite by Lee (The Ice Storm works on a so many different levels), but his best love story and one in which he coaxes difficult performances out of his actors. One thing does nag me: would this film have succeeded if they had used actors who were closer to those in the short story rather than the two most handsome young men in Hollywood?",Brokeback Mountain
689,kolrimes,The irony of the 60s and 70s,10,8 February 2006,"Ennis and Jack live in a world of stunning natural beauty, and I suppose the director meant for it to be that way. But even up to the present, for every breathtaking setting in rural Wyoming there is the omnipresent threat of a rigid and repressive social order that is lethal to variant lifestyles. In effect, Ennis and Jack are as much prisoners of geography as they are of their own hopeless love. The trade off against the mountain beauty of Wyoming is the looming menace of a social order that stamps out unwanted diversity, such as unisexual love, with horrible dispatch. As the plot unwinds into the licentious 70s, Ennis and Jack are faced with the inescapable irony that a few tanks of gas or even hitchhiking and the courage to leave wives and children would have delivered them to a locale where gay relations not only were tolerated but were open and freer than they have ever been in US history. Intensifying the irony is the fact that a trailer for the documentary ""Gay Love in the 70s"" precedes the showing of Brokeback Mountain. The garbage strewn streets of the East Village or the ""gay ghettos"" of San Francisco and Los Angeles, while not as awesome and clean as the mountains of Wyoming, would have provided the perfect setting for the domestic conjoined bliss that Ennis and Jack so desired. But they remain prisoners of their own locus on earth and the human horrors concealed therein.",Brokeback Mountain
690,cynsk8,A Must See,8,23 January 2006,"Not Quite but Almost spoilers****** Well, not for the lack of trying, we finally made it into a sold out showing of the newest Golden Globe winner. For all the hype I was expecting a slam dunk best picture nominee, however the reaction was more ""what was all the hype about."" This movie is unquestionably a must see. It is ground breaking on so many levels and challenges one to remember the profound obstacles to being gay in America.Brokeback is every bit about story. Except for the expansive shots of BIG Sky country, above average performances by Heath and some very emotional sex scenes, to me this movie lacked the necessary elements of a ""best picture"" film. Don't misunderstand, I thought the movie was amazing, it drew me in and I did not feel the time passing. Clearly the ""best adapted screenplay"" Oscar is a shoe in.What seems to resonate most about this picture is forbidden love that is so deeply hidden and denied. It is this contrast between sweeping all encompassing love and deep tormenting anguish that makes you feel constant tension and discomfiture.",Brokeback Mountain
691,benl-4,Provocative and Beautiful,9,25 January 2006,"Ang Lee has created some amazing films, and this is another. A covert gay relationship between taciturn cowboys is a provocative subject, but I felt that the film handled it well and gave an illuminating look at the subject of homophobia. Brokeback Mountain was filmed in Alberta's Rocky Mountains and I spend part of my career as a geologist in that region. It gave me chills seeing an approximation of my old life in the outdoors up on the big screen.Brokeback Mountain was beautifully filmed with powerful performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal as ranch hands Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist. I noticed that the sets of actors playing Ennis' growing daughters were particularly well cast too. To me the tale boiled down to Ennis and Jack being caught by a desire they couldn't acknowledge and a choice they couldn't make. The film captures the tragic consequences; Ennis pushing away everyone that loves him and Jack's unfulfilled but agonizing need.",Brokeback Mountain
692,elgaroo,Don't Believe the Hype,8,21 January 2006,"Yes, this is a very nice movie. Beautiful scenery, fine directing and shooting, very good acting, interesting drama...but it certainly is not the phenomenal masterpiece everyone is raving about. Plenty of other movies are far superior, but get a tiny fraction of the praise this film got. If the main couple were not gay, I doubt it would have ever gotten out of the underground. Of course, I guess if it takes a gimmick to get a decently made movie into the big theaters for a change, I can not complain too much.) The first half of the movie is a detailed look at the everyday lives of cowboys in the 60's?, and by far my favorite part. The second half is mostly less interesting domestic drama amongst small-town and country folk in the 70's. The actress who plays Jack's wife is very pretty and a good actress, but especially whoever played her daughter when grown up I think is a wonderful actress, and I really hope to see a lot more of her. The actor who played Jack was great as usual and still one of my favorite actors, despite having played Spiderman, though he did a good job even there and I hope he got payed real good for it. There are some very funny and cute bits throughout.Yeah, I cried.Anyway, I guess it's a good thing for there to be more non-hetero relationships on screen in general, and it is good to look at things differently, but I can not say that it really did all that much for me. I have much more appreciated other queer depictions, such as Hedwig, and Niel Gaiman's graphic novel A Doll's House (not yet a movie, unfortunately!) Do not believe any rumors of excessive female nudity.)",Brokeback Mountain

It started as a average movie but then I saw the movie crumble before my eyes. Yes I agree seeing two guys kiss was quite an event and yes it did earn that mtv award...but hello it's a horrid movie.I don't understand what this movie is supposed to show people...what is the moral?! I go to a catholic girls school and to tell the truth I have been adapted to the gay life, not because I want to but because I accept the way they choose to live life. This movie shows a different perspective of life...but not the ones people want or need to know about. It pushes the limits too much...I can't say I didn't enjoy this movie...it was enlightening but enjoying it the way i expected was not in my favor.

694,tony-peterson,"An excellent, haunting film...but what does Jake's character see in Heath, and where are the ""secret smiles"" all lovers share?",10,15 March 2006,"Although this is an excellent, haunting film, it was still very disappointing on so many levels, and the biggest disappointment was the absence of any sparks between the two main actors, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal.The entire romantic angle of the film is spoilt because it's hard to fathom exactly what it is that Jake's character sees in Heath's character, because Heath hardly says a word, and just mopes around endlessly. Where are the knowing, ""secret smiles"" that all lovers share? Nowhere to be seen in this film, that's for sure.It's all very well for Heath's character to be too scared to come out of the closet, but surely, every now and again, when the two of them are together, he'd show some form of affection. After all, they are supposed to be madly in love with each other. They show a bit of enthusiasm when they go off to their ""fishing trips"", but except for one or two moments, we never see them having any fun together.The supposedly controversial sex scenes are too tame.There's a lot more genuine sexuality in the original short story and it would have been a real breakthrough if, for once, a Hollywood film had smashed through a few of the remaining taboos and made a flat-out effort to tell this story the way it was originally written.Despite my initial disappointment, I can still see it's an excellent film, and perhaps one that needs to be seen a few times before the full impact sinks in.",Brokeback Mountain

696,Kalamata,A blue-jean bodice-ripper,6,18 July 2006,"I don't know what it was I was expecting in this film, but what I got sure was different. It started pretty quickly, too, with the first sex scene in the tent. To begin with, the sex happened way too quickly given who these guys were and what this kind of sex meant in those days. It was so sudden that I just guffawed. It was a big, Huh? There was tremendous social pressure against it. Two men could certainly fall in love and have sex, happened all the time, however, under the circumstances given by the movie, it was just too quick. There wasn't the kind or lead-up that you would expect. I wanted more character development. I needed to see what drove both these men to suddenly indulge in what was a forbidden love in that time and place especially. This wasn't after all, New York or San Francisco. While Jack Twist seems to have always been the truly ""gay"" one of the two, he would have been more careful about going after Ennis like that. A guy could get killed. Merely running around a campfire, having a few conversations, and then the guys are yanking each other's clothes off? I can't buy it.The movie was choppy. It was hard to follow the scent since the two guys lived far apart and needed to meet up a few times a year for their trysts. And little or no discussion of what all this did to their home lives, their children and wives. It was incredibly selfish and self-involved. Like somehow this was sacred, the love that is above all others. It was guilt-free which is complete nonsense to me. Ennis does mention that once, but truly, the pain that these two men were causing other people seemed to mean little or nothing to them. It made the characters seem extremely cold, selfish men. Yet I believe it was the director's desire that we should be completely forgiving of any shortcomings because this was just too big to be concerned with little things like other people's pain. The single, final confrontation between Luann and Ennis, long after they have divorced, was the one nod to the terrible selfishness and cruelty Ennis visited upon his wife and family. And even then it is as if Ennis never really gets it. He's incredibly dumb.Also, I found the film to be quite melodramatic. In a sense, it is a bodice (Pendleton?)-ripper, an overripe romance novel kind of love story. No one ever discussed this film in those terms with me. Either people hadn't seen it or they just thought it was the best movie EVER (or at least since Dances With Wolves). But really, this movie falls into a genre which is better described as a chick flick. I understand now why women seem to be the ones who just ""adore"" this film. Go take a look at the Brokeback Mountain IMDb boards. It's to swoon over! Seen in that light, I better understood what it was people were feeling. The film takes itself way too seriously, too. There is barely a glimpse of humor in it. I felt that the director and writers, good as they are, felt they were making something very important, something that was so special that it needed to be treated in an almost hallowed way. Once you sanctify something you have removed the humanity from it. Luckily, the last act stepped back a bit from that. Ennis's solo trip to find out about Jack's life and death was the best part of the film for me.There was one thing in particular that I found quite jarring, however, when Anne Hathaway tells Ennis about how Jack died. The director suddenly stuck a flash insert into the film that showed Jack being beaten to death by two men. This was a cheat. Did this actually happen? Is this Ennis's imagination (that doesn't ring true)? Why is that there? The reason given by Hathaway's character was perfectly good enough. It was banal, as it should have been. No drama, just a stupid accident. I didn't read Proulx's story, but I think she meant that he did die in a stupid tire-changing accident. The best revelations in the last act are how Jack Twist's father talks about how his son kept dreaming of bringing someone up to the ranch and setting up a household there and bringing the ranch back up to speed again. And the final scene with Ennis arranging Jack's shirt and jacket on the hanger was beautiful. Very touching. Too bad the film itself didn't have more of that kind of poignancy in it.",Brokeback Mountain

It's incredibly well done, and rich with it's metaphoric setting of a western wilderness harboring a love that neither character can ever truly accept, but nonetheless can't live without. Based on a short story it's been expanded to a full on epic. None of the short descriptions really pay this film justice. This includes breakout star making performances by the 2 male leads Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams and director Ang lee ( all multiple award winners and nominees including the Academy awards). This is the most awarded best picture of 2005, and one the most awarded in history along with Lord of the Rings:return of the king and Titanic.This is a film that haunts you long after it has ended and allows you to believe in the power and strength of love again.

I must have read the damn thing fifty times. She is such a gifted writer, able to sum up Ennis' whole life with just one beautiful, poetic sentence. I seriously fell in love with the story and was so excited when I discovered that they were making a movie version.Ang Lee was definitely the right man for the job as he is such a gifted director. I've been a fan of his since I saw the Ice Storm back in '97 and his cast are almost spot on. Jake Gyllenhaal is a perfect Jack Twist, just the way I pictured him and his last scene with Ennis is probably the best piece of acting I have seen in a long time. Michelle Williams' Alma was also a revelation - she sure has come a long way since Dawson's Creek. Anne Hathaway was good as Lureen, a character completely padded out for the movie. My only problem was Heath Ledger. He's just not Ennis. OK, he plays him as the reserved and monosyllabic person that he is but he's just lacking something. I am not disputing that he wasn't amazing (and very brave) but there just wasn't Ennis'... sadness, for lack of a better word. Also, I felt that the passion between the two was lacking somewhat.Despite these small faults it was still an amazing movie, and I hope that Gyllenhaal and Williams pick up Oscars for their amazing performances. Well done to all involved.",Brokeback Mountain
700,davidesachs1,Excellent,9,6 May 2006,"o, in Brokeback Mountainadapted by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana from a plain but evocative story by Annie Proulxyou have two guys with slim hips and dungarees and cowboy hats pulled low. They lean against pickups, smoke cigarettes, and trade monosyllables (if that). They're suitable for framing. But in the course of an early 1960s summer herding sheep on an isolated Wyoming mountain, they find themselves growing closer and closer and  yes, on Brokeback Mountain they make the beast with two broken backs.Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger play the men. Gyllenhaal's Jack Twist is the more extroverted one, the rodeo rider, the cowboy who makes cow eyes. Ledger's Ennis Del Mar is the quintessential Westerner of few words, and the words he says are not always audible: He speaks with a Wild West lockjaw that's sometimes annoying but also weirdly hypnotic. Ledger's performance is prime Oscar bait: He's ostentatiously immobile, with uncanny low toneshis voice is 50 fathoms deep. The whole performance is sub textual.",Brokeback Mountain
701,SinisterDreamMaker,...They Love Each Other?,3,2 April 2007,"Reading the comments here it's good to know that I'm not the only heterosexual male to have seen this sorry excuse for a love story. Also reading the comments here I think I'm the only heterosexual man who saw this movie that is not a homophobe. I really don't care at all that the movie's about two dudes, what I care about is the fact that everyone said this is such a ""powerful love story"" and it's nothing special...at all. Yes the movie's pacing is slower then a line at the DMV. You cannot understand a d--- word Heath Ledger's saying. But the storytelling is worse then the mumbling.I was asked to watch this ""Powerful Love Story"" by my girlfriend so seeing I will do anything for her, and that I'm a Film Major, I should be exposing myself to as many different kinds of movies as I can, I agreed to watch this movie. Quickly I realize that this movie is going to be a ""long haul"" with it's painfully slow pace. Then at about 15-20 minutes into the movie something happen that I didn't see coming at that point; Heath's ramming Jake in the ass. I was stunned, I thought what the hell? I looked at my girlfriend and her mother and they seemed unfazed. There was no foreshadowing to this, just a couple rack focuses of Heath with his back to Jake as he takes his shirt off, he didn't even make an attempt to look at him just a rack focus. There was no hint to sexual interest between them at all. If you're trying to tell a ""Powerful Love Story"" real love does not start with nookie, maybe if you're in high school, and you should show that the two characters, I don't know, love each other. In no way was I convinced that these two loved each other...at all.The characters later get back together and have secret ""love"" up on Brokeback Mountian, and talk about running way with each other so on and so forth. So the secret relationship goes on for years and then the two men have a falling out because Jake needs to have sex more then the few times they meet. This relationship sure is filled with ""love"" the one guy in the relationship need sex so he cheats on his partner in Mexican back alleys he must ""love"" him so much. If they loved each other so much Jake's character could keep it in his own pants. I don't care if he did it because he felt like he was living a lie or whatever REAL love is about sacrifice. Years later Jake's character gets killed because he can't keep it in his pants and gets caught. I'm sorry but I cannot feel or care for a character that dug his own grave like that, he knew what would happen if he kept up his man-whoring ways but he just kept doing it.In the end you really don't care about either character. They both were both just so selfish. Both never thought about anyone but themselves, not their kids, (who they abandoned), their wives, (who they abandoned) not even their relationship (which Jake's character screwed up with cheating and Heath's character screwed up with his controlling nature) just themselves. I would of like to see a movie about how they sacrifice so much to be together and how they worked through it because they loved each other, you know a ""love conquers all"" that would of been nice to see but what does Ang Lee give us a bad soap opera about gay cowboys, thanks Ang thanks a lot.

704,saturdaynightbeaver,Would have received very little attention if there were no homosexual elements.,4,27 June 2006,"When hearing that Ang Lee was helming a movie about cowboys falling in love, I initially thought that he had the potential to beat his own masterpiece, The Ice Storm. What an incredible set up: a notoriously closed-minded part of society to outsiders combined with a less tolerant era and two men living lies with wives. But he somehow blows it.Aside from the cinematographic style and some of the acting (Williams role actually has the most gusto to it), this movie is flat. It is a Romeo and Juliet scenario in that the lovers are forbidden to love. We know how old that plot is. But that plot can be still intriguing, thrilling... And unfortunately this version goes no further than just the plot. We just follow Romeo and Juliet around until one has to go.Sounds like a bad ""chick flick"" and, in a sense, it is. I was expecting the development and growth that were committed in just one day of storyline for the Ice Storm characters and was left with two stiffs that never grow in thirty years of storyline. What happened to Ang? Why would the gay community be so excited about this over past gay cinema that was much better? Doesn't this go underneath expectations when (if all the fat was cut off) this could very well been a short? So why did it get all the awards attention?One could argue that Ang was trying to give us the longing that this relationship had over a long period of time, thus the length. I'll buy it but it didn't effect the way I saw the characters. Why didn't other films that handled men dealing with both impulses to sleep with both man and woman get this much attention? Weren't the characters in Six Degrees of Separation far more interesting? What about Hedwig and the Angry Inch? Water Drops on Burning Rocks? All About My Mother?Watch some Pedro Almodovar from Spain. He is a smart director who is brave enough to make films about gay culture that actually tests us, thrills us, gives us something other than easy tragedy. I guess the point I am trying to make is that if you were ""wowed"" by this movie then you will explode upon watching any of the above films, because Brokeback falls short.",Brokeback Mountain

You are forced to review your moral code and ethics. You start asking yourself, Is this kind of love or what ever it is known possible? Should it be allowed or least be tolerated? Can simply two men fall in love, in its purest and innocent form? Such questions continually disturb you. What Director Ang Lee has weaved in his latest celluloid so philistine and utilitarian. Heath Ledger's Ennis is just a simple man, who succumbs to his passion and desires, which was assuaged by Gyllenhaal's Twist. Together, they forge a friendship which transcends the test of time and redefining the meaning of companionship. You start wondering, will they continue? Ang Lee's canvas, slowly but infallibly unfolds the emotional trauma which affects including you. Yes, continue they may but at what price?

Everything was happening too fast and too vague. I kept hoping things would get better during the second half but it just kept getting worse.The actors were good but I don't think they were great.

Between Heath and Jake, I thought Jake was more convincing, as a man yearning for the man that he loved and wanted; and dealing with it in his own way during the times he couldn't be with him.This is one of those movies where the tormenting pain of love is expressed in a way not often seen. I think it reaches people who are in love or who've loved and lost.

The beauty of this story lied in the silence of the charters, the fact they can't really express their feelings (particularly Ennis) and in the way it's delicately filming. Technically & artistically, Brokeback Mountain is sumptuous. Heath Ledger's interpretation of Ennis was amazing and so is the acting of Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams & Anne Hathaway. A heartbreaking film that haunted me days & days after I've watched it, like no others did before. The soundtrack is also beautiful, ""The Wings"" almost brings me to tears each time I hear it. -",Brokeback Mountain
710,goldilocks_78,"Heartbreaking, gut-wrenching about how lonely life can be when you can't be true to your own nature",9,21 November 2005,"When I saw Brokeback Mountain last night at the Oslo International Film Festival, I was perhaps a bit over the top desirous and eager to see it, as I had recently read the short story by Annie Proulx which I had replayed over and over in my head. Thus, I was somewhat numb throughout the whole screening, and it wasn't before after I had returned home and lay sleepless through half of the night with an unfamiliar tummy ache that I realized the profound effect the movie had actually made on me.This understated and heavenly beautiful movie directed by Ang Lee tells the story about a love that finds its wrong time and place in society. It is 1963 and two young ranch hands spend a lonesome summer herding sheep up on Brokeback Mountain, where they inevitably fall in love. However, they are unable and unwilling to recognize their relationship for what it is, leading their lives into misery. The film moves in a slow and chronological pace, telling an utterly realistic story about utterly realistic human beings. The dialog is never superfluous, making every second of it loaded with significance. The imagery of the Wyoming landscape and the sparse music score conveys the huge loneliness of these two men. However, as much the movie is lonely and quiet, it is full of emotional tension.The story is above all conveyed through the brilliant acting of the two main characters. There is perfect chemistry between Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Ledger portrays the hesitant and reserved Ennis del Mar. Gyllenhaal portrays the hopeful and daring Jack Twist, who is open about his desires and willing to take his risks to be with the one he loves. They complement each other and bring each other's character to perfection in a graceful and touching manner. Watching them act together is one of the wonders of the world. Body language, subtle glances and facial expressions tell their own story. We get close to the protagonists and we can feel their pain.What is most painful is the characters' inability to deal with their relationship  not even to define it. They know what they feel, but societal norms, their upbringing and all they have experienced thus far in life has taught them that 'this thing' cannot exist. They are both uneducated and come from broken homes and they simply do not have the reference frame to acknowledge what is going on. Their words are few, and they never mention their feelings nor do utter words such as 'sex', 'love' or 'relationship'. Instead, they constantly refer to their relationship as 'this thing'. On the other hand, through their actions and body language it is impossible to be mistaken about their true feelings. It is also impossible to be mistaken about the fleeting moments of true bliss and peace they find in each other's company during their short 'fishing trips' throughout the years. Not to speak of the lifetimes of misery they and the people around them experience all the while the two of them are trying unsuccessfully to lead normal family lives.The movie stays with you. And you want to stay in it, however painful it is.",Brokeback Mountain
711,mattfg,New American classic love story,10,12 September 2005,"I was lucky to get a ticket to the second screening of Brokeback Mountain at the Toronto Int'l Film Fest in September, months before the well-deserved hype kicked in. This is an absolutely beautiful movie. From a gay man's perspective, the love story was both satisfying and heart-breaking.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal give equally moving and accomplished performances, although the story tends to focus more on Ledger's character. Heath is note perfect in this role. I didn't detect a false moment once from him. Regardless of whether or not he wins the Oscar, his performance in this movie will be watched and admired for years to come as a landmark in acting. I truly related to his character's internalized homophobia. Every gay man has been there before. In many ways, he represents the embodiment of shame and self-hate, a product of his American, western culture. The flashback showing his father take him as a boy to look at the dead body of some murdered gay man should be shown to every Christian fundamentalist out there who ever argued (and continue to argue) that homosexuality is a choice and that gay men and lesbians are nurtured by their environment. I've seen the movie three times now, and Heath brings tears to my eyes every time - he's so good. Jake is also incredible, sweet, nuanced, loving. He had the difficult part of being essentially the ""love interest"" rather than the main character. By the end, he personifies the tragedy of hopes that never come to be - as captured perfectly by Lee with the cut between the flashback of Jake's longing and beautiful face next to Jake 20 years later worn down by the weight of dashed dreams, wondering what could have been. This is one of those movies where you find that you fully appreciate both performances of the two men, Heath and Jake, equally, but perhaps one before the other over time. I was first blown away by Heath's performance, which seemed to eclipse Jake's performance - but over time, I've learned to truly appreciate what Gyllenhaal did here and how utterly perfect his portrayal really is. The other performances in this movie are all first-rate, especially Michelle Williams who is the portrait of vulnerability in this movie. She deserves all the accolades she's received for this performance. Anne Hathaway did well too with very little screen time, but knocked it out of the park with the phone call scene at the end (incidentally, the only scene her character even had in the original short story.) The movie should become both an American love story classic, as well as a gay classic. Glad to have someone of Ang Lee's talent take on a project like this. What an amazing man he is!",Brokeback Mountain
712,jer-allen,Very affecting,9,12 January 2006,"I was deeply moved by this poetic and heartfelt movie. There was a real conviction about the performances. I can well understand the other comments that have been made. The sense of place is palpable -you get a feeling for the vastness of America and the immense beauty of the landscape. I think it is a very well written film, the dialogue has a natural unforced quality. I wasn't really sure that I liked the way the story worked out - in many respects I found it too sad. I am not sure I could willingly experience something as heartbreaking as this more than once. I would like to read the original story and see the differences. I think it is a film that can have an impact on real lives. It is shockingly sad - left me numb with despair and it is hard to get out of your mind. I hope it can change people's views and enable them to understand the complexities of human love a little more clearly. I wish I could say I enjoyed the film but it is too affecting for that.",Brokeback Mountain

I'm totally surprised by the hype surrounding this movie! BM is a simple, slow paced, predictable love story. OK, its a gay love story but who cares? Just change the sexual orientation of a character gives a movie all that status? OK, now i will begin to make Gay films and won some Oscars! Speaking seriously, Brokeback Mountain is an ordinary and boring movie. The strong sex scenes with famous actors and convincing roles gave this movie all that notoriety and media but, looking on the neutral movie fan prism, the movie lacks content and power.There's a WHOLE bunch of amazing pictures in 2005 like Cinderella Man, Constant Gardener, Capote, Syriana, Good Night and Good Luck and, specially, Crash. It's a shame, but this poor movie (Brokeback Mountain) will take the Oscar...Trust me, if you want a good movie, skip this one.",Brokeback Mountain

I read the short story years ago and was moved deeply - but Larry M. and Ang Lee have fleshed the story out to perfection. . The film is magnificent - beautifully directed, beautifully acted, beautifully scored. There's not a false moment in it from anyone that I could see. . The beauty of BBM is that it is so utterly human: our very best choices when we make them can lead to suffering the likes of which we cannot dream. And happiness, despite its social ramifications, is frail: it must be held with care and nurtured, enjoyed even as it dissipates before our eyes.",Brokeback Mountain
715,kubrick2899,*** - Not as Good as I Had Hoped,5,29 January 2006,"I rate films on a scale of five stars. I gave it three. Here's what I say (my wife agrees, on the most point).Here is how I describe it: It's a mixture of Cold Mountain, Closer, and Urban Cowboy, all of which are better (except Closer, of course). The film moved WAY too fast, the aggressiveness in the sex scenes was totally not needed (there is a difference between passion and aggression), and it relied way too much on sentimentality at the end. Everything was forced, nothing flowed very well. If the film had been paced slower, it would have been a fantastic film. I really wanted to love it, but unfortunately, I have to give it ***. If it wins Best Picture, I'm going to be very disappointed with the Academy.",Brokeback Mountain
716,pineapple_1013,"Um, Wow.",9,4 February 2006,"I went to this movie fully expecting to be disappointed. I tend to hate hate hate things that are over hyped, and this movie was so over hyped. But I went anyway, mostly to fulfill my role as the ""family liberal"", and I'm really glad I did. The movie, and I'm gonna sound like one of those stupid hype swilling people, but can't help it, was amazing. Finally, a movie in Hollywood about. . CHARACTERS!!! And people can go on and on about the pros or cons of homosexuality, but the plain and simple fact of life is that these things happen to people, and you can't hide true life just because you don't agree with it. And I think that was portrayed excellently in the film. The scenery, to start with, was gorgeous. Really wonderful shots. You really got a sense of the general BIGNESS of Wyoming and it's been since the LOTR movies, I think, that I've seen such a pretty film, in spots. I liked how beautiful the scenes on brokeback mountain were compared to the ugly dullness of life in town for Enis and in Texas for Jack. The acting was really fantastic. Some people are gonna hate Heath Ledger's performance because, for more than two/thirds of the film, it's incredibly subtle. He doesn't talk much, he hides his emotions, but you can see them, seething through, and THAT my friends is what makes a good performance, not leaping all around the screen. My particular favorite moment for him was after their first summer on Brokeback, when Jack drives away and he kind of collapses in an ally sobbing. Fantastic. Jake Gyllenhaal, whom I've loved in everything I've ever seen him in, does a really good job as Jack Twist, showing a lot of love and vulnerability underneath his bravado. Michelle Williams completely shocked me, and I think her performance may have been the best of the bunch. She just radiated betrayal, disappointment and controlled rage. Anne Hathaway had almost no screen time, and I wasn't fond of her character, but she did a good job, particularly in her last scene. The story, which is arguably the most important part of a film was just. . .so very very well done. I thought the relationship between the two men felt very authentic, as did their difficulty in coming to terms with what it meant. The only complaint I had was that the first time they touch each other, they suddenly have sex. There was buildup, but it didn't seem quite enough somehow. But I guess in film you have to get started somewhere, and maybe the suddenness of it was intentional. Beyond that one small complaint, however, I thought the relationship was handled beautifully. It was one of few movies I've seen lately where I actually cared about the characters. I wanted them to be happy, even though I knew they couldn't be. This does not happen often to me. Just to share,the three scenes that really hit me the most where (and here there be spoilers, friends) The last scene where Jack and Enis are together, after they fight and Enis kind of breaks down and they make up, there's this incredibly sweet flashback to their first summer on the mountain. It felt so natural and gentle and beautiful, and authentic, which, frankly, you don't get on film much. The scene where Alma freaks out on Enis during Christmas, saying she knows what was up with the two of them was very well handled, as well as Enis' violent denial of it. And the scene where Enis goes to Jack's parents house. The tension and everything unsaid in the kitchen was so authentic, and the scene with Jack's shirt in the closet kinda ripped me up. On a final note, about the controversy surrounding the film. . .there's in point of fact, much less sex than would generally be considered acceptable for a ""Straight"" film and so the concern about gratuitous sexuality is unfounded. Finally, I thought the subject matter was handled really well. You can't choose who you love, even if it wrecks your life. Jack and Enis where unable to act on their love for each other in an honest way, because of the society in which they lived, so they had to live a lie, for good or ill, because they needed each other. What ultimately happens to Jack, who was less able and less willing than Enis to conceal who and what he was, is a reminder of the ugliness of intolerance, but the movie doesn't preach at you. It doesn't scream ""we're here and we're queer!"" it basically just shows you two people very deeply in love, who really can't do a darn thing about it, even if they'd like to. ""I wish I knew how to quit you"" Jack says, and although Enis tells him to go ahead, ultimately, they know they never could. Love sucks like that, but it's also devastatingly beautiful, much like this movie.",Brokeback Mountain
717,jen0830,"Excellent movie, robbed of Best Picture...OK Jen, take a breath, let it go...",10,2 April 2006,"As a straight woman, seeing it with three friends, we were moved to tears by this film. I think the ""homophobic"" pseudo-liberals of Hollywood showed their true color ""YELLOW"" as in cowardice. They would not vote for a film about love between two men. I live in LA and when I heard a producer friend, who is now just an ""acquaintance"" say that ""Of course they wouldn't give it to a movie about ""bf"" gay cowboys"". I was livid and I asked people who voted if they saw the movie and many of them said no. They were uncomfortable with it and had no desire to see it. The ""politically correct"" race relations in Crash was a safe issue, homosexuality was not. What a bunch of closeted, hypocritical bigots! What can I say, to have both a gay and trans-gendered theme film nominated for Academy Awards is wonderful. I pray that more funding and talent and clout go toward excellent films like these and alleviate the hatred and stupidity of our society. If anyone connected to this film reads this, you did a remarkable job!",Brokeback Mountain
718,princessjenifer,What a double standard!,4,24 January 2006,"Before I even begin to explain why this movie was such an enormous letdown, allow me to first state that several of my best friends are gay, and I was DYING to see this movie from the second I heard about it. However, if you are expecting a romantic love story, this is in no way such a thing. I find it very hard to believe that critics would have categorized this film as a romance if it was involving heterosexuals. For instance, the very first ""love scene"" involving Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal did not involve any kissing, touching, or romantic gestures...simply pure, raw, and almost angry sex without any foreplay whatsoever. If Gyllenhaal's character had been a woman, would that be considered a loving scene? Definitely not. Throughout the movie, the two men meet for countless weekend getaways, but are still willing and able to live strait lives, such as making love to their wives...so doesn't that constitute them as bisexual? I was completely unsold on the fact that these men were even remotely in love with one another...they were merely too fearful to come to terms with the fact that they enjoyed a male romp from time to time. Their ""love"" was only defined by the fact that they were unable to admit their secret desires to anyone else, leaving them basically stuck with only one another. Lust and passion definitely exist, but the idea of mistaking that for romance seems almost absurd to me. Films such as ""Unfaithful"", dealing with heterosexual infidelity would never have the audacity to try and pass off a sexual affair as an unending love. I feel as though the critics that praised this movie as touching and romantic were almost afraid to say otherwise, in fear of stereotyping homosexual affairs. There is no way that they would have felt the same way if Ledger's character had been ruining his wife and children's lives with another woman. Unfortunately, double standards such as this are constantly overlooked, due to the fact that everyone is terrified of upsetting gay rights organizations. It was also difficult to have sympathy for the two men portrayed, when after twenty years had passed, they were still unwilling to come out, despite the fact it was the early eighties. It seems quite implausible that two people, gay or strait, would essentially give up such a tremendous love for one another, based on outsiders' perceptions. Overall, the story was well told and nicely acted, but in terms of portraying an emotional romance, they sadly missed their mark.",Brokeback Mountain
719,Sainsdy,"Good work by Jake, Heath back to the drawing board",9,20 July 2008,"I loved this film and would have loved it more if Heath's role had been played by an actor more suited to the whole ""in the closet gay man"". Jake's a top performer and just like so many of his other films the word depressive comes to mind. Jake is really suited to these rolls and somehow separates the similarities in them for each film. While there certainly was a lot of media attention surrounding this film, both good and bad, it probably helped it, in terms of attracting a larger demographic. Unfortunately there are better ""gay"" themed movies. One that comes to mind is Shelter (2007). Acting level is pretty much on par. Overall the ending certainly leaves you feeling moved and you'll end up loving Heaths performance but he certainly didn't do it himself.",Brokeback Mountain

It didn't change after seeing the movie, but I still like this movie.Directing, storyline, acting, dialog, cinematography, all of those are excellent. Ledger is doing great, but Gyllenhaal's acting is more or less overlooked. I think he is performing equally well. Williams is doing great, so is Hathaway despite that she is not given a lot of chances to present herself. I really like the scene of her talking with Ennis after Jack's death.What most attracts me is the movie is developing quite natural. It is not forced at all.

Lee has taken the gay love story and put it where it should be-in the mainstream. Brokeback Mountain is ultimately about the paralysis of regret and how it fractures the lives of not just those afflicted by it, but everyone else around them. Justice was done when Ang Lee won the Oscar for the Best Achievement in Directing. This movie has the simplicity and clarity of a fable wedded to the gnarled and taciturn physical realism of the Western. As I said justice was done when Ang Lee won the Oscar but some justice is due as Brokeback Mountain is a cinematic landmark but, unfortunately it's not in the IMDb Top 250 list.

722,mtaffeot,"Sad, haunting and beautiful.",10,11 December 2005,"I had the privileged opportunity of viewing this movie at a packed cinema in New York last night. Every show had been sold. There was a buzz and anticipation like I have never experienced in my movie going history. We all sat with baited breath ready for the start of Brokeback Mountain. The advertisements for up coming movies couldn't go quick enough.The movie is over two hours long but didn't seem so to me. I was riveted to the screen. The story unfolds at a nice easy pace and just draws you in and keeps you there. It is simply one of the saddest and most haunting movies I have ever seen in my life. This is the type of movie that you don't realize its impact until several hours later as you toss and turn trying to sleep, but the movie just won't leave you alone. It's difficult for me to even put into words how this movie has affected me, except to say that my eyes keep welling with tears when I think about Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar, two poor, uneducated men who simply just wanted to love each other, but live in a world that refused to allow them this honor.I went in with high expectations and was not disappointed. The acting is amazing, especially by our two main leads Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger. I know there has been much credit given to Mr Ledger on his performance, but Mr Gyllenhaal is equally as amazing in his roll. He plays a perfect Jack Twist. The chemistry and body language between both these actors is excellent. The intimate scenes between the two men is believable and beautifully shot. The second love scene is so very touching. It brought a lump in my throat. But the most heartbreaking scene comes during the end of the movie, which I won't give away, but it involves the line ""I wish I knew how to quit you"" Watch the performances by both Heath and Jake at this part of the movie and tell me it doesn't rip your heart out.There is such a feeling of sadness and loss which grows and grows as the movie progresses. So much longing as you watch these two beautiful young men grow older, only to meet up a couple of times a year. They share a love that is so profound and strong that many of use only wish we could find this type of a bond in our lifetime.Ang Lee has done a masterful job. Every aspect of the movie from directing, to editing to score is astounding. Much love and care was given in the making of this movie.This truly is one of the greatest love stories ever brought to film. I plan on seeing it again next week, and maybe then I will be able to shake it out of my system. Although I doubt I will.",Brokeback Mountain

There is an element of hope within the melancholic sadness of this Ang Lee masterpiece. There hasn't been such a limpid definition of love since the world was still innocent. Limpid, yes, that's the word that comes to mind, remembering the shy lopsided smile of the extraordinary Heath Ledger. Who could possibly have predicted that Heath Ledger was such a giant, unquestionably destined to a legendary career. Well, Ang Lee I guess. Lee seems in total control of his canvas. Every frame is a moment, the silences are exquisite, the humans are as humans are and we're allowed to dive into their hearts without tricks without illusions. Raw, limpid, poetic and above all, true. I can't wait for the world to meet Jack and Ennis in this startling Ang Lee, Larry McMurtry universe.",Brokeback Mountain
724,losdzez,Deeply Affecting,10,26 December 2005,"Seeing there were so many comments I wasn't sure I should post, but here goes. It won't be your standard review, though - haven't you already read plenty that tell you the story? First, unless you are deeply homophobic it will be tough not to be moved by this story. It isn't about gay sex, it's about human love. It's about how love sometimes overpowers us, how we can't control who we fall in love with, how we as human beings need connection with one another, and about how empty our lives can be if we don't find that connection, nurture it, care for it, and allow it to grow and deepen.It's about how the need for a particular person in your life can live in spite of time and distance, even beyond death.And finally it's about how life is too short for us not to go after what we want, to try to be something we're not, to deny something strong and pure.And Ang Lee managed to create a film about a gay relationship that has such a purity that we are not concerned about the logistics of their sex life. We only want them to be together, because if we loved someone that way, we would walk through mountains to be with that person.Some have said they should have just made this about a heterosexual couple. But what makes this story work is the backdrop of fear and hatred, the danger that this couple faces for something lovely between the two of them that harms no one, and that's no one's business but their own. Hetero couples don't have to face what Jack and Ennis face.The movie isn't perfect. Some of the secondary characters could have used a bit of fleshing out. I wasn't thrilled with the makeup meant to age Jack and Ennis.But Heath and Jake were phenomenal, sweet and knowable, and we half fall in love with them ourselves, wanting to shove them together. The sweetness of their love touches us where we are the most vulnerable.And as many have mentioned, the film will make you long for a love of your life.",Brokeback Mountain

Any fears one might have that the material will cause discomfort or inappropriate laughter are quickly dispelled. The pure quality of the observation, the depth of the intellect displayed both in the script and behind the camera, the sensitive level of the performances and the high quality of all technical credits translate into a rare cinematic experience.

729,RunnerOnIce1125,"A good movie, but not very enjoyable",6,2 January 2006,"There are many things about this movie that make me compare it to In The Bedroom.First of all, just by watching it, it's obvious that it's a good movie. It's bold, with excellent visual shots and an uncomfortable, tear-worthy ending. Critics love it, for whatever reasons- political, visual, or by sheer merit of the actors alone. There are fabulous performances- in this movie, by Jake Gyllenhal and Michelle Williams; in In The Bedroom, by Cissy Spacek and Tom Wilkenson.However, just like In The Bedroom, this movie is very rarely enjoyable. It's long, and tedious, and relies a lot on symbolism, which is fine only for a second viewing- the first time around, it feels slow and torturous. There are few genuinely funny moments- understandable, as it is a sad film- however, Return of the King (for example) manages to keep humor piled next to the tissue box. And the directors have both successfully renounced their relial on music to create emotion- a path that rarely manages to succeed.Brokeback Mountain was a fabulous idea. Let's face it, how many movies out there unashamedly display homosexual relationships as the main plot line- not a coming out story, but a relationship, without making it seem any more taboo than a regular affair? Unfortunately, it was very poor implementation. There is far too much emphasis on outside relationships, considering how little the audience cares about their non-Brokeback lives. There is lovely chemistry between Jake Gyllenhal and Heath Ledger, but Heath Ledger's character is an asshole for no apparent reason, and Heath Ledger himself has decided that a Wyoming accent means never opening your mouth to speak- as a result, it's nigh impossible to understand a single word he twangs.Frankly, I was disappointed. That doesn't mean I'll never watch it again. I still need to pick up on all of that symbolism- and, let's face it- reevaluate the Gyllenhal/Ledger sex scenes.",Brokeback Mountain

731,stvstt,BrokeBack Mountain: Short Change on the Range,8,22 January 2006,"Brokeback Mountain is poignant, thought provoking, haunting. It is a beautiful creation. But behind its beauty lies some terrible fault lines.It is based on an Annie Proulx short story, but unlike Proulx's earlier work Shipping News there is little character development. Ennis and Jack remain the same people at nineteen as they do when they reach their late thirties. As we are excluded from the various 'fishing trips' they undertake we are not aware of the subtleties that their relationship can take on. At the start of the movie they enjoy sexual physicality, but by the end of the movie they sleep together fully clothed. Annie Proulx assures us that their sexuality loses none of the intimacy, so what has happened in the screenplay? In fact, the screenplay is very lazy and contrived. Larry McMurtrey and Diana Ossana do reschedule a lot of the dialogue and add some padding with the wives and liaisons, but we learn nothing else Essentially, they've treated the original story as pitch perfect and sacrosanct  no revision necessary. But the story begs revision.As it stands the story is ahistorical, Jack and Ennis seem to live in a complete time bubble. In 1963 all gay relationships were difficult whether you lived in Manhattan or Montana. However, by 1983 things were a lot different. Stonewall had happened, the seventies were full of new bisexual or androgynous cultural icons. Legislation had changed or was changing. In this respect Jack's character doesn't make sense. He originally denies his sexuality to Ennis on being queer 'Me neitherit's a one shot thing', but we quietly discover throughout the movie that in fact he is really conscious of his sexuality. His only release is in furtive visits to Mexico to have sex with prostitutes, or surreptitious liaisons in log cabins with farm managers. As far as 'You don't know how hard it gets', in reference to the difficulty of sex, this is nonsense because there were a number of bars and clubs in down town Dallas and Houston at the time. Annie Proulx wrote the story shortly after the brutal murder of Matthew Sheppard, a gay man in Montana. Leaving aside this brutal hate crime, Proulx re-invents the myth that there are no go areas for gays, and this forbidden sex has given zest to the story. Since the movie came out there are a number of men who have (bravely) come forward and stated that they are 'cowboys' and they are gay. Homosexuality may not be popular outside the metropoles but it is there, and gays are there, and honestly so. Proulx and the film parades the myth of marginality and that gay liaisons are seedy, dangerous, and lethal.Ang Lee has stated that given the span of the movie he was faced with a dilemma: did he play older actors in young parts or young actors in older parts? The former would have been comical, so he opted for the latter. However, as competent as Gyllenhaal has being in earlier roles, playing the older Jack clearly stretched him.The denouement scene between Jack and Ennis, where Ennis learns of Jacks infidelity was disappointing. Gyllenhaal was weak here. This is the climax of the relationship between them, but Gyllenhaal played it like an over wrought teenager, and didn't have the acting maturity to pull it off successfully. He played it too flat and too even tempered as though he really didn't understand the emotional depths to which this speech required. It was as though he was shouting at mum and dad because Santa didn't bring him what he wanted.Ang lee has stated that he originally conceived 'Brokeback' as being 'art-house' because of the (much made of) 'sex scenes'. Independent film has never had the restrictions imposed by the Hayes code, and where Lee succeeds here is that he makes these scenes contextual and sensual and not voyeuristic. Even most heterosexual scenes at best aren't filmed this sensuously. Lee wants to inject mainstream cinema with the sledge hammer honesty of independent film, but this comes with a price tag. Hollywood is bubble gum factory that reaches the mainstream with outdated and reassuring clichés. Hollywood is dishonesty congratulating itself that is has sponsored a movie that deals with a love story between men. Gays have nothing to thank Hollywood for as gays have been more often than not portrayed as insipid, shallow, one-dimensional ciphers. In fact Ang Lee's own earlier independent film 'The Wedding Banquet' is far superior and honest in its depiction of a gay relationship. And it has a happy ending! Hollywood kills gays with a touch: Murders, suicides, HIV. It isn't enough to see Jack and Ennis drift apart during this movie, neither reaching the conclusion of their relationship, nor understanding it, nor even happily going into the Malboro' sunset with each other. Someone has to die, and Jacks longing for sex and companionship condemns him. Where gays don't die is when they become imagined palatable stereotypes for the masses: sex hungry disco bunnies. And that's another form of death. Brokeback is beautifully seductive, but its legend of sex equals sadness and death is too much. I cry for Jack, because I wanted him to live and breathe, and to have a future. Hollywood, you sonofwhoresomebitch why can't you learn?",Brokeback Mountain
732,alkarania,"Haunting movie, best I've ever seen",10,12 March 2006,"I saw this movie for the first time about six weeks ago and although I knew it was a beautiful movie, I realized I didn't quite get it. Then strangely enough I found myself thinking about the movie days later, something that has never happened to me. So I read the short story and went to see the movie again, and boy did it get me the second time and each time I've seen it after that. In my mind, this is the only case of a movie being far better than the book it was based on. I've seen it eight times so far and cry every time and am still haunted by it. I'm glad to see that I'm not crazy based on the posts here. I even bought the script and the soundtrack for Santaolalla's beautiful score and Rufus Wainwright's haunting and melancholy ""The Maker Makes"".What I found so incredible is that apart from being beautifully done, this film made me care so much about people who I would appear to have nothing in common with (I am a 36-year old female, American, of Indian heritage, never been to Wyoming though have been to Texas.) Ennis and Jack are very real to me and it's somewhat of a shock to remember that these are just actors who have gone on to other projects. It made me reflect on the decisions I've made in my own life, missed opportunities, missed loves, fears, etc. That is incredible film-making, and this movie deserves to a classic. Even if everyone involved in this film never make another good film the rest of their lives, they should be immensely proud of having been part of this film. I'm also awed that people like Ang Lee and Gustavo Santaolalla, who didn't even move to the US until the 1970s, could be involved in making such a beautiful piece of Americana. I am an American who has been living abroad for more than four years, first in Paris and now in London. Oddly enough this movie has made me proud to be an American again (which has been difficult through the Bush presidency), to see that this sort of movie can be made and do well in an America that has become hostage to the conservatives (although I wonder if it's making most of its money from people like me seeing it multiple times rather than having wide appeal?). It gives me hope. For the first time, I want to move back to the US and see these beautiful places.I was very disappointed that ""Crash"" won for best picture, thought it was a pretty bad movie. I was also surprised to read that some members of the Academy in supposedly liberal Hollywood couldn't bring themselves to watch ""Brokeback Mountain"". Guess times haven't changed that much. A response to a very strange comment I've seen posted, that Ennis was ""raped"" by Jack and somehow forced into the relationship? Jack certainly made the first move, but after the initial struggle with himself, Ennis became the aggressor. My favorite scenes: the second tent scene, the reunion, but most of all, the flashback near the end to the Brokeback Mountain days where Ennis holds a sleepy Jack from behind, humming to him and rocking back and forth, where you see the love on Jack's face, then being rudely brought back to the present where you see Jack looking sad, disappointed, and frustrated, and knowing that this is the last time they will ever see each other.",Brokeback Mountain
733,rdesalvo,12 Things I Learned from Brokeback Mountain,4,17 January 2006,"Although I was strangely unmoved by director Ang Lee's noble attempt to make the masses forget The Hulk ever happened, it doesn't mean I walked away from Brokeback Mountain completely empty-handed. Here are a few valuable things I learned from America's favorite gay cowboy opus.1. Copious amounts of beans and whiskey will make you gay. Like, barebacking gay.2. Dishes, dishes, dishes. There is an inordinate amount of dishes to be cleaned in the '60s and '70s, but, thankfully, Michelle Williams really knows her way around a kitchen sink -- as does this director.3. Anne Hathaway really knows her way around a wig.4. It is very difficult to express all the important, heartfelt things you have to say to your new gay cowboy lover with a bunch of marbles and peanut butter in your mouth, but you'll still get nominated for an Oscar.5. Every guy in Texas is a closeted gay EXCEPT the rodeo clown.6. People didn't age in the '70s...they just grew sideburns.7. Any time you have sex with a woman instead of your gay cowboy lover, she'll have a baby--in the next scene.8. Children do nothing but scream, cry and break things in stores. (And prompt you to go fishing with your gay cowboy lover).9. There are no gay hustlers in Texas, but they are all over the place in Mexico.10. It is a way better idea to wait out the sexual revolution and risk a painful death at the hands of homophobic hicks in Wyoming or Texas instead of moving with your gay cowboy lover to -- gee, I dunno -- San Francisco or Fire Island.11. If a movie is over 130 minutes, it means that it is really, really important. Like, Oscar important.12. Gay sex is excruciatingly boring -- even with Donnie Darko. Who knew?",Brokeback Mountain
734,JMAN-8,Broken Mountain,6,20 January 2006,"Here, as I see it, is the problem with the film: Flaws. Not a spectacular amount, but enough.For starters, there is no initial tension between Ennis and Jack. It almost seems like they just decided, due to an accidental embrace in the night, to have sex. There was almost no sexual tension between them from the start, and their bond seems forced throughout the rest of the movie. I never felt like there was real passion there.The biggest failing of the film, however, is its length. This would be a great 100-minute film...unfortunately, it's 134 minutes. Some of the characters seem two-dimensional and some of the plot threads dangle like parts of a badly-woven sheet. For instance, the man who invites Jack up to the cabin for ""fishing"" appears just a little too convenient.Undoubtedly, the best part is centered just before the end, when the friction building between Jack and Ennis comes to a head, and concludes with Jack's death. Ang Lee, however, doesn't let it end shortly after that. He drags it on, much like the rest of the film, until any sense of emotional connection with the characters drops off and the viewer is left with a disconnected feeling of confusement. Confused, as in ""Why did I spend over two hours on something this banal?"" Perhaps with a little more time in the editing room, a better build-up to the relationship, and less time prattling, this could have been a really quality film.Unfortunately, the politics surrounding it force this film to be spectacular, rather than merely bad love story. So be it, hindsight, such as it is, is 20/20.",Brokeback Mountain

Nope. Turns out I in fact did really really really like this movie. Because it was good. Because it was damn good.

I looked at is as two people loving each other ,but drama was keeping them apart. My favorite part would have to be when jack visited Ennis at his house. It touched my hard. Another part would have to be the end when Ennis visited jack house after his death and saw his shirt that he saved with the blood on it. It almost made me cry. Overall I thought the movie was an A+.

740,inman50,"One of the greatest, saddest, most heartbreaking films ever made.",10,21 December 2005,"I can see by the voting curve that there is a weighted backlash against this unforgettable film. Whether that has anything to do with homophobia or just plain ignorance I have no idea, but it doesn't speak well for the vocal minority apparently full of narrow-minded hate and fear. And I say this as a straight male who feels that Ang Lee and his remarkable cast and crew have made one of the most HUMANE films ever, one that eclipses gender issues and tells a beautifully understated tale with a poet's eye and a tragic undertone of yearning. Heath Ledger doesn't merely act in this film, he inhabits the role of Ennis Del Mar with a depth that feels more real than any ""performance"" I've seen in memory, and that includes Philip Seymour Hoffman's astounding acting in ""Capote"". The way he attempts to throttle his feelings, even as they continually bubble to the surface, is a wrestling match painful to watch, the dilemma of a man torn between what he thinks he should be and what he is. He and Jake Gyllenhall as Jack are terrific together. You can feel their furtive bond lighting the screen, even as they know, sadly, that it can never be anything more than episodic. But what is so devastating about ""Brokeback Mountain"" is how this love compromises the lives of those Ennis and Jack enter as substitution for their own passion. I will never forget the stricken look on Alma's (Michelle Williams) face as she catches Ennis kissing Jack with a ferocity she has never known in her marriage to him. You can see the life draining from her eyes, all hope of whatever she hoped to have shattered in a single, revelatory image. After all the dust of controversy has settled, time will justly award this magnificent film its rightful place in cinematic history.",Brokeback Mountain

Beginning from the plot, the very good (and good looking) protagonists, the emotional scenes and ending with the fantastic photography and the views of American environment. The meaning of the film too is touching and involve the spectator in this beautiful love-story where sexuality isn't important as some critics want to tell us defining this movie ""scandalous"". The cast on the whole is very good and dialogs are convincing notwithstanding some long periods of silence at the beginning of the movie. The last things to add are that it is a very good movie that makes people reflect about love in its noblest form and above all that this is a movie that makes people cry so bring with you many handkerchiefs!",Brokeback Mountain
742,clonesheep,Slightly above average,5,26 December 2005,"I find myself surprised, or maybe not so surprised, that I am in the minority by giving this film a middle-of-the-road 5, while the majority of readers here rank it either 10 or 1. Read on, then, as my comment might provide a fresh ""third opinion"".Let's begin with a random note. Brokeback Mountain has been described as a ""gay love story"" but the most explicit nudity in the film are those with the women, notably the gratuitous nudity with Anne Hathaway's bare breasts. This is, in fact, the third time Ang Lee has asked a young, inexperienced actress to bare their breasts in a gratuitous manner. The other two being May Chin in the Wedding Bamquet and Jewel in Ride with the Devil. What is this all about only Ang Lee knows. The example here (that the director put more female then male nudity in a gay love story) illustrates the lack of focus of the film. That, indeed, is a major problem.If the aim of the film is to portray, in a positive vein, a gay ""relationship"", it did not succeed. The two men we see are connected mainly by their need of sex. Other than the social constraint in the 60's and 70's, what separated the two men were mundane matters such as money and family responsibility, with which Ang Lee filled the film aplenty. That is not surprising to me. Many have praised Lee for being able to jump from genre to genre. In truth, all of Lee's films belong to the same genre, namely, family drama. Family drama is Ang Lee's comfort zone, upon which he built the movie, then added the gay theme to it. That is what Brokeback Mountain is at its core. Unfortunately, the family drama part turned out to be rather ordinary, while its permeance sidetracked the supposedly main theme -- the love between the two men -- in the film. In the end, the film is unfocused and the characters in it failed to connect.This is not to say that the film has no merit. Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams are excellent. The best scenes in the movie, oddly, has nothing to do with the gay couple but are all played between Ledger and Williams' characters. The cinematography is good, too. The soundtrack is boring, though.",Brokeback Mountain
743,TheHip14,What gay cowboy movie?,9,19 February 2006,"To walk into Brokeback Mountain expecting to see what most ignorant people call ""the gay cowboy movie"" would be massively underestimating this wonderful masterpiece by Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon director Ang Lee. Brokeback Mountain follows a 20 year love affair between ranch handler Ennis Del Mar(Heath Ledger) and Texas Rodeo Cowboy Jack Twist(Jake Gylenhall). It's the summer of 1963 and Ennis and Jack are hired to go move a flock of sheep's over Brokeback Mountain. While up on the mountain alone the two unexpectedly fall in lover creating what would be a 20 year hidden love affair.What follows next is a movie that will move you and may even shatter you emotionally. Ang Lee shows he is a master with the camera as he directs every shot with perfection. And Heath Ledger and Jake Gylenhall give career defining performances. Accompinied with an unforgettable score composed by Gustavo Santaolalla and breathtaking cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto this film is one that will be talked about for decades to come and will go down in film history as groundbreaking and unforgettable.When true love grabs hold of you the best thing to do is grab back and hold on, because before you know it, it might be gone, like in Brokeback Mountain.I rate this film 9/10",Brokeback Mountain

A thousand other words could not say or mean as much. As far as westerns go, they do not get any better than ""Lonesome Dove."" As far as tragic and forbidden-love stories go, ""Brokeback Mountain"", as told by Director Ang Lee, ranks with ""Romeo and Juliet"", Bronte's ""Wuthering Heights"", Hemingway's ""Farewell to Arms"" or Hardy's ""Jude the Obscure"".

This is a story, not about gay men, but about unfulfilled love that lasts over 20 years and is a ruling factor in these men's lives. I appreciated the realistic views on the obstacles to such a relationship, how it can affect a person's life when they try to do everything they can to be 'normal'.

Therefore my expectation was high, but I came out with an annoyed and disappointed feeling.The characters are very likable but the story is very weak. The love between these two main characters is idealized, in my opinion. First of all, such love cannot survive over 20 years. In the movie they are still deeply in love with each other. While such love is plausible but it is simply not real. With 50% divorce rate in this country in mind, and as someone who has been through such process, I see how love can change over time, drowned by daily mundane tasks and familiarity between two people. It is a miracle that a romantic love can survive 10 years, not to say 20 years. In the movie, the two main characters maintain their love through secretive meetings once a while. Such love may be able to survive because it contains no daily context, and no struggling through life through shared effort together.I do like the music and cinematography very much. Every shot is very powerful. However, the writing and story is so weak that a skilled director cannot save it.",Brokeback Mountain
750,lleeheflin,what do you mean this isn't a gay cowboy movie?!!,10,20 January 2006,"I have spent the last several hours reading user comments here about BBM (I got up to page 11). Everybody has said pretty much everything that can be said about the astonishing quality of this film in all possible aspects. And I was very very pleased to see how, almost universally, everyone was overwhelmingly moved by the sheer experience of it on the emotional/visceral level. At the same time, as I read on, I became more and more annoyed by so many of the commentators, gay and straight alike, wanting to 'neuter' the story by asserting the primacy of it's so-called 'universal' theme of thwarted LOVE at the expense of the specific example of it presented in the film. What is astonishing about this film is precisely the fact that the universality of ""LOVE"" in all of it's heavenly AND earthly pleasures and pains plays out to the fullest between homosexual couples AS WELL AS heterosexual ones. A few years back we got the straight version of this theme in Wong Kar Wai's IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE, a nearly equally astonishing ravishing film. And I don't recall any reviewer of that film feeling it necessary to down play the heterosexuality of the couple involved. As a gay man, I had absolutely no problem with the fact that they were straight. It never even occurred to me to want to 'explain away' that seemingly essential aspect of their story. As a gay man who came of age in the late 50s, I learned without having to think about it how to twist the straight stories that constituted the social environment of this world to fit my own personal needs. Given only a little imagination, any heroine can be morphed into another hero. By and large heterosexuals never find themselves in the position of needing to do this. This kind of 'make believe' is foreign to their lived experience. Until now that is.BROKEBACK MOUNTIAN has changed all that. It is precisely the fact that it is about the blooming of love/lust between two seemingly 'ordinary' (and at first seemingly straight) young country boys in the outback of Wyoming that gives the film it's astonishing visceral impact. I do not think it is now possible for a 'love story' about a straight couple to achieve such a level of impact on an audience. We've been there and done that ad nauseum. No, BBM is the utterly astonishing experience it is precisely BECAUSE it is about the socially doomed sex/love relationship between two men. Not two stereotypically 'gay' men of the ""Will & Grace"" type or like that pathetic caricature of a gay man in that awful film of Tod Haynes. But rather real flesh and blood MEN whose maleness is unquestionable.This then brings us to the real crux of the 'problem' with BBM: in a word SEX. Sex between two very hot & virile men who could have had any woman they wanted (and did) and yet who only knew truly mind boggling passion in their physical sexual experience with each other. It is precisely THAT which dooms their love for each other. It is precisely THAT which is the 'forbidden' about their love for each other. 'Love-buddies', if you will, only become 'problimatic' when they veer too close to becoming 'F-buddies' (if I'm not mistaken, one has to be 'coy' about these things on this site.) After all, BUTCH CASSIDY & THE SUNDANCE KID was a huge huge success. It was very easy to ignore the 'homoerotic' guts beneath the platonic skin. And that is what I see happening now with the response to BBM. People are desperately trying to hide the 'wolf' of real men, not just having sex with each other, but having the most rapturous sex of their lives, sex beyond anything they ever experienced with a woman, under the 'sheepskin' of some kind of sexless platonic 'ideal' called L O V E.Both Ennis and Jack were sexually functional with women. But they were only sexually ALIVE with each other. When Jack resurfaced into Ennis' life with his postcard, what nearly drove Ennis crazy was not just the prospect of seeing his ole buddy. It was rather the prospect of becoming ALIVE again in Jack's arms in the throws of their sexual passion. When Jack finally arrives they both try as best they can to maintain a buddy/buddy stance. That lasts about 10 seconds. And it is Ennis who breaks that impossible illusion, throwing all caution to the wind and in his sex/passion crazed state drags Jack, not into hiding, but rather to the foot of the stairs to his own back door where he practically devours him with kisses to the utter horror of his wife who, at that precise moment, has come looking for them. What so blows her mind, is less that he is kissing another man, but rather the total abandonment of his passion. She had never seen her husband that totally and unabashedly ALIVE before.Ennis and Jack are not mere 'symbols' for some kind of sexless platonic 'ideal'. They are very real men who were nearly starving to death for want of the nourishment they got from their sexual passion for each other. It is the sexual component of their relationship which gives it it's overwhelming power. To rob it of that, would leave us with just an empty not very noteworthy sheepskin. And BBM would not be the movie it is.",Brokeback Mountain

Actually had to blink away a few tears before the lights came up at the end. And being a red-blooded American dude, I NEVER cry at movies...or so I thought.This film touches some very deep emotional chords. I have heard it said that the central American pathos is loneliness. And the companion to loneliness is an aching, unfulfillable longing for understanding and companionship through this all-too-brief sojourn on planet earth.As with most of us, these two guys dreamt of the utopia that love promises...and then settled for a compromise better suited to the 'real' world. It is just there that the film makes its most poignant impact. Rather than arguing for a utopian vision (though Jack certainly keeps that ideal on the front burner), the film accepts the reality in which the story takes place; a reality framed, to some extent by the prejudices of society, but more importantly by the choices that the characters themselves make.In America anyway, we CHOSE loneliness...rather than social ridicule, or personal turmoil and self discovery.Why?

Viscerally it is a love story, but the symbolic vile nature of what is really going on is so well hidden that no one got it. It is simply too intelligent for today's typically mundane film goers.Take the title: Brokeback Mountain. What does it mean? It is where Ennis and Jack realize what they mean to one another. Two men in love. The film going audience interpreted this as a cultural step towards the acceptance of homosexuals as normal day-to-day human beings that also have feelings and can also fall in love. But the title of the film says it plainly: Ennis and Jack are the poison to society. They have to hide what they feel. They must keep it a secret and they do so at ""Brokeback Mountain."" There they commit there sins of infidelity and homosexuality and they ""break the moral back"" of society with the weight of their sins that has now, symbolically, taken the weigh and immensity of a mountain. There are other mountains nearby and theirs seems to blend in to what is a beautiful landscape, but the film almost always focuses on mountain of the title. It is only natural, because if you see or feel a problem you direct your attention toward it.Like the loose tooth that you keep probing with your tongue, you have 31 other teeth, so why put so much effort into one when you hardly think of all your teeth except when you are washing them? Because it is a painful problem that you want to get rid of. With all that in mind, watch the film again, but with this attention to subtlety and see a truly thought provoking and intelligent horror film that makes a powerful moral commentary.",Brokeback Mountain
753,kjosm,"very real, moving, no Hollywood ending",9,8 January 2006,"This movie was amazing in a number of ways. One, it had realism in it. It never went for the Hollywood typical endings, or even character and storyline resolutions. We are left feeling like they missed out on so many opportunities, even opportunities to say a tender word. But I think that is what made it feel real, because in reality we all have huge regrets and wish we would have said something different, done something different.I loved the love story between the two of them. I went, being fans of both actors, not knowing how they would portray two men in love. And they both blew me away. The tension between the two of them was almost better then any male/female love interest I've seen them have in past movies. I think I felt it the most when Jack comes to visit Ennis after four years of being apart and they fall into that unexpected kiss. It was very intense, forbidden, and you could see the emotions behind it. I really hope the actors get awarded for the intensity and passion they put into their roles.The characters also felt very real to me. I have relatives that 'rodeo' and also some quieter cousins that live on small horse ranches... They acted/talked almost identical to the people I know that would have similar lifestyles. I think I laughed out loud the first time Jack says 'Shit' because the accent was like hearing one of my Uncles talking.This movie was an awesome contribution to cinema. It was set in a beautiful location, had wonderful actors who had remarkable performances, and had a strong love story that pulls at the heart. I highly recommend this one!",Brokeback Mountain
754,conrad_wells,a touching and beautiful masterpiece.,10,23 April 2006,"This film was very powerful, moving and thought provoking. I went with a male friend to see this film who had a real gay phobia. He admitted that he now has a new opinion of the gay society. I loved it. It does not matter the gender of the two characters who obviously formed a very strong bond.The film was beautifully put together. A tragic love story that will be one of my favorites . It was genius and very brave of the crew to put this out there. I gotta admire that.I love Michelle Williams and she was magnificent here!!! Bravo!!!I was drawn into the tale from beginning to end. A real tear jerking love story for sure.Jake and Heath were very wonderful and brave to star in such a film. Their attractiveness has tripled for me!!To able to be so comfortable and confident of their acting abilities to take on such controversial roles. If the film sucked, it could have ruined them.Now they have certainly earned respect of avid moviegoers.It has paved the way for such silly phobias to be erased. We are all god's children and are all equal in his eyes no matter what sexual orientation we are!!!",Brokeback Mountain
755,leppakt,Beautiful filmed and expertly edited and directed human story,10,17 December 2005,"A beautifully filmed and directed story about two men and the people in their lives, who suffer the effects that social stigma inflict upon homosexuality in the rough tough and intolerant world of rural America. The suffering of these two men and the tragedy of their imposed discretion is shown in this film to something that makes all the people around them suffer likewise. It begs us to ponder the unspoken question - what if these to men were allowed to be honest and open with themselves and the people they are closest to in their lives. The happiness they are denied in their own relationship is reflected in their inability to share fully and honestly their feelings with the other people their lives touch. And, in turn, the punishment society imposes upon them is a punishment that in turn society imposes upon itself. The hard bitter beautiful truth of the taboo of Homosexual relationships is depicted with first class storytelling. Also, though I was uncomfortable with the thought of watching guys depicting sexual simulation. It is handled very tastefully, and complete intimacy is only depicted briefly early. Then it is extremely subtle with simply embracing and cuddling here and there. By the middle of the film it seems most tame and natural. This is about two people caring about each other, sexual interaction is nominal.I'm curious as to who Ledger took his accent from. I kept thinking it sounded familiar. If anyone knows can you post it? I've figured it out ! He is doing an impression of Sam Elliot - as the cowboy/narrator from the Big Lebowski. What do you think, am I nuts?",Brokeback Mountain
756,Minkwan,A film to treasure.,10,19 February 2006,"I came to ""Brokeback Mountain"" with many recommendations from friends who utterly loved the film. This usually means disappointment because few films live up to the hype, but ""Brokeback Mountain"" exceeded my highest expectations.The film is concerned with gender, relationships, fidelity and the human need for love, affection and companionship. Ledger and Gyllenhaal, who are both painfully convincing, have both said that this is not a gay film per Se, and although I first thought they were pussy footing around the fact, I have come to agree with them. The film doesn't merely portray a same-sex relationship or sexual encounter, although it does both, it rather addresses the construction of gender. What makes a man. This is most obviously done through the appropriation of what was in the 60's an unquestioned icon of machismo, the cowboy. Ang Lee gives us a glimpse behind the rough exterior of the Marlbro Man and exposes a vulnerable, tormented and guilt stricken man trying to survive and desperately trying to punch themselves into what is acceptable. The films narrative foundations may be that of a classic Hollywood thwarted romance, but it is so affecting.The film is beautifully photographed but almost too heartbreaking to watch, with every scene filled with unspoken truths, desires and tension. The men cry and break-down, but presumably not enough to let out all that is fermenting inside. Instead the cinema screen weeps. If you allow yourself the emotional connection needed to fully appreciate this film, then like me you'll leave the cinema with a stomach ache, completely exhausted.Lee's direction is invisible, but deft enough in order to analyze, pull apart and examine what's been done. This is a Hollwood film which adheres to independent sensibilities and made by an Asian director. A film about two (for a lack of a better word) ""gay"" men who are played by two straight actors. A quiet, in all senses of the word, film which is about the unsaid, the repressed and the silenced which manages to say so much, with sparse dialog.""Brokeback Mountain"" is a film to treasure.",Brokeback Mountain
757,insane-romantic,"Brilliant, Moving, Original",10,27 January 2007,"Brokeback Mountain has to be my favourite film around right now. Where can I start to explain why? Firstly, the acting - especially by Heath Ledger - was excellent. Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger play the main two characters and, despite being rather good looking, are most certainly not just ""pretty boys"". This is established even in the first scene as, before any words are even said, you can almost tell that you are in for a treat. The more minor characters, especially Alma (played by Michelle Williams) and Alma Junior (played by Kate Mara) are important and also brilliantly portrayed.The storyline, based on a short story by Annie Proulx is original and brilliant. Despite being described as a ""gay cowboy movie"", the film is not about sex, but about love & society. One thing which struck me most about this film was the two main characters totally different reactions to their ""situation"". The interplay between the characters is brilliant, although not so many words are spoken - especially by the character of Ennis.I am not going to ramble on about how everyone should see this film because it is about gays - see the film if you want to, but don't necessarily see it because it is a ""Gay cowboy film"" - and certainly don't use this as a reason NOT to see it. This film does show how homosexuals were treated in the past, and shows a lot of social issues and things like that. However, see this film for the great acting, storyline and scenery - if you get a little something extra out of it (as many have) then that is fantastic, but even so this film is brilliant. A must see!",Brokeback Mountain
758,ibezdechi,A bittersweet study of relationships within the context of a straitjacket of social mores.,10,18 December 2005,"""Brokeback Mountain"" is a beautiful yet bittersweet study of relationships and how social mores often put a straitjacket on two hearts while still living in the world under wraps. Heath Ledger performance as ""Ennis Del Mar"" and Jake Gyllenhall's performance as fellow cowboy ""Jack Twist"" and Michelle Williams as Ennis' wife rely on a complicated interwoven subtexts as Ennis and Jack grow and bond together. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is not about what some may characterize as ""two gay men"" who happen to be rough and tough cowboys, but rather, two fragile souls which bound together in a union in the midst of an unforgiving and misunderstanding world. Ang Lee's direction and Gustavo Santaolalla's musical score is sensitive yet never gets in the way of the story. ""Brokeback Mountain"" has the ingredients to covet all of the awards to win big in the Golden Globes and the Oscars -- especially the hopelessly wrought Gordian Knot which drives Heath Ledger's character.",Brokeback Mountain
759,leena_maaretta,Can't stop thinking about it,9,8 March 2006,"I went to see this a few months ago. I was fairly exited to see it, since Ang Lee was the director. (One of the good ones, in my opinion). I was the youngest person in the movie theater, but lost all interest in the fact as soon as the movie started. The movie captured me at once, from the every first minute till the last. The film was like a beautiful, slow dance. My eyes refused to even blink, it was so pleased with the beautiful photographing of nature, cities and people. The acting blew my mind! Jake Gyllenhaal was a playful, wild but sweet rodeo-guy. Heath Ledger hands down won the whole movie as his role as the quick guy with a deep inner pain. The story was heart breaking. It was a beautiful love story about fear, confusion and hopelessness. The love-couple knew what would make them happy, but it was too frightening, to odd, that they refused to do it, they just couldn't accept what would make them happy, so it was just a affair full of despair. And that, my friends, was painful to watch. That's what struck right through me. I left the movie theater amazed, and my head filled with thoughts. Till this day I can't stop thinking about it. In my opinion, this might be one of the best movies of the year of 2005. I was talking to someone my own age just yesterday, and told her it's one of the best recently made movies. Jake Gyllenhaal has done spectacular work before! I recommend you to watch this movie, along with ""Donnie Darko"". I give this movie 4 stars out of 5, but the whole film is, to be honest, 5-star-aqulety. Go see it if you like movies and films, in other words, a cinematic!",Brokeback Mountain
760,writer_cb,An intense experience - fabulous film!,10,29 January 2006,"An hour after I saw the movie, and I'm still tearing up about it! This movie was excellent. I have been caught up in the movie hype, and secretly getting excited about it, and reading the excellent reviews of it here on IMDb. I have been wanting to see it for ages, and knew it was going to be good (and was so happy when it won awards)! But even so, my expectations were not just met, they were EXCEEDED. This movie is more excellent than I can put into words. I think it will open a lot of people's eyes to the real beauty of the love that can be shared. The love between these two men, Ennis and Jack, was amazing. It struck chords in my heart and left me breathless, and teary, and it really made me feel for them.This movie is amazingly poignant. The acting is SO amazing! I've never seen Heath Ledger act better than he did in Brokeback Mountain. Jake Glyllenhaal I had never really seen in movies, but I knew his name, and he did a wonderful job in this movie, too. He has those eyes that just sink you in and get you stuck there, swimming in them.The plot is realistic, telling of the hardships of 1963, but mostly the movie is about the love shared between the men, and how they cope with not being able to be together every minute as they wish.This movie also had some really funny parts in it. It's a drama, but there were some parts that really had me laughing. And at other parts, it can be so intense...intense passion...intense anger...intense sadness, and anguish...""Brokeback Mountain"" is a masterpiece because of the giant heart the movie, and its characters, have. Their hearts show through their love. It's stunning. It leaves you wanting to see the movie over, and over, and over.Poignant. Beautiful. Magnificent. These words can't even sum up the total effectiveness and excellence of ""Brokeback Mountain."" This is a movie you must experience in order to understand its greatness. See it, and you will understand.",Brokeback Mountain
761,hilarys778,intense,9,8 January 2006,"Twas a very intense movie. Heath Ledger seems to act well just by not acting very much...his brute-quality and deep, deep voice make an easy Ennis del Mar, one I can't see too many other actors being able to do. Gyllenhall was good enough as Jack Twist, too.Jack's father was almost a caricature (for his brief scene) and Anne Hathaway just looks too plastic, too good-girl (though I think she acts just fine).Gorgeous cinematography.I like the quiet banter between the men the best.Parts made me want to be a cowgirl, but not the rodeo type. The quiet, tough, dutiful, outdoorswoman type.",Brokeback Mountain
762,jonathangold2003,Endless stream of gay cowboy-related drivel,1,29 June 2006,"At the outset I will confess that I was somewhat apprehensive about watching a film described as an 'astonishing tale of gay cowboy love'. However, having read almost invariably rave reviews about it and, after much persuasion from my girlfriend, I capitulated and gave it a chance. Unfortunately, the experience vindicated my initial apprehension. This film was truly dreadful.Brief plot: Two cowboys go up a mountain to look after sheep. One stormy night, they bugger each other in a tent. This type of behaviour continues until it is time to come down from the mountain. After this they go their separate ways, both getting married and having children. They then start meeting every so often for elicit romps on the mountain, telling their unfortunate wives that they are going on ""fishing trips"".This is the sum total of the film. The film goes on for hours and hours and consists of endless boring dialogue interspersed with some man dancing. I was tempted to hit the stop button to bring an end to the mind-numbing boredom about ten minutes into the film but resisted the urges, clinging on to the desperate hope that something might actually happen - it doesn't.The point of the film seems to be this: Even manly cowboy types can be gay. Wow! what a revelation. I had always assumed that the vast majority of cowboys were gay anyway. The point is cunningly proved by the juxtapostion of scenes where the protagonists do manly things like fighting, drinking beer and... er... bare back riding with scenes where they kiss and romp. Sometimes, they even combine the two by wrestling (apparently manly of you're American')and being over-affectionate at the same time. Genius! This film left me feeling truly empty. I wasn't shocked or offended by the daring portrayal of the 'taboo' subject matter. I was just bored to tears. The only characters who I felt any sympathy for were the wives who had to put up with their husbands' homosexual philandering.It would be nice if people would stop lying and pretending that they liked this film for fear of being branded a homophobe and just admitted that it was utter mindless twaddle. It might persuade producers and directors to stop insulting our intelligence with this kind of rubbish and force them to think about story lines and plots. Films aren't there to make points; they're there to entertain. If they make an interesting point as a side effect, then fine. This film didn;t make any point that wasn't utterly trite. You cannot make a bad film good just by making the characters gay! PS. I put that this contains a spoiler to avoid being blacklisted but there really is nothing to spoil",Brokeback Mountain

I deeply respected Ang Lee's hidden tiger crouching dragon so I had a lot of expectations about that.Sorry to say I was disappointed in the end. Not that the movie was bad, but I didn't find it so extraordinary.Some of my friends are gay, so i know this can happen to anyone and that gays are normal people like you and me who only love men instead of womens. And I also know that it may be a quite difficult life to live even in today's society which is quite more tolerant than in the past.But way, maybe because I knew it i didn't found the movie so revolutionary. Anyway reading all the comments, I may have been in a bad mood the day I saw it.For the good points : The photography is really nice and the two actors are great : Don't know if they were gay or not. If they were not, really nice job guys !",Brokeback Mountain
764,patrick-bliss-1,A new euphemism for repression,8,1 March 2006,"Brokeback Mountain rides in on four Golden Globe and four BAFTA wins and is widely tipped to do well in this years Oscars. Ang Lee is once again revisiting his favourite themes of the unspoken love, constricting traditional values and relationships filled with lies and deceit (The Ice Storm gets a cheeky name check) with a tale of forbidden love between cowboy Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and rodeo rider Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal).The two meet in 1963 when they are assigned shepherding duties on the eponymous mountain. In true Western fashion, both are men of few words, but after living and working together a bond slowly develops between them. When they end up in the same tent the night after a storm, curiosity and unbridled passion gets the better of them, and their clandestine affair begins. Both subsequently get married and have children, but their illicit meetings (masquerading as fishing trips) continue well into the seventies. It's a story of two men coming to terms with something that's bigger than both of them. Should they bite the bullet and surrender to the love they have for each other or just be good cowboys and live the American dream? The spectre of Brokeback Mountain looms over them in judgement and Lee, following on from the Incredible Hulk and his earlier Chinese films, once again examines the influence a dominant father can have over his son. When Jack presses Ennis about the possibility of living together, Ennis recounts a time when his father ""made sure he saw"" the body of a gay man who had been tortured and killed by enraged locals. It's a reminder that it's not so long ago that the ""crime"" of being homosexual could result in a lynching. Of the two, Jack is more promiscuous, regularly travelling to Mexico to meet rent boys and willing to make the long journey up from his home in Texas on receipt of a one line postcard from Ennis. Ennis on the other hand settles for having sex with his wife from behind. Jack is also the more pushy and outspoken, and regularly tries to engage Ennis in conversation about their future, suggesting that they could find a ranch somewhere and run it together. Gyllenhaal is certainly convincing in a nagging wife kind of way, but ultimately, it's Ledgers film. His portrayal of a man racked with guilt and repression builds as the film goes on, culminating in an emotional showdown with Jack. By the end he looks as if his life has been sucked from him, the broken wreckage of a man sitting alone in a dinner eating a solitary piece of that age old symbol of American ""family values""- apple pie.The performances from the women are equally impressive in their portrayal of despair and rejection as they learn of their husbands' misdemeanours. When Ennis' wife Alma (Michelle Williams, a dark haired, more wholesome version of Renée Zellweger) catches a glimpse of her husband in a passionate embrace with Jack, she says nothing and stands by her man. But the pain shows and gradually their marriage crumbles. Jack marries Lureen Newsom (Anne Hathaway), the daughter of a bigoted farm machinery dealer. She sticks by Jack to the very end, but there is no doubt that she knows exactly what is going on, her terse treatment of Ennis on the phone at the end of the film showing both contempt and understanding. The film is handsomely photographed making good use of the rugged Wyoming exteriors, hard drinking bars and macho rodeos to frame the dilemma faced by the two leads. It's the America of old movies, tourist brochures and adverts. You can imagine Lee showing his cinematographer old Marlborough adverts and saying ""that's what I want this film to look like"". These are Marlborough men on the outside but confused little boys on the inside. Lee has made an important film which will be remembered for decades to come. The subject was also covered recently in Todd Haynes film Far From Heaven, but this stands as a definitive statement on the subject. The phrase ""they're living on Brokeback mountain"" may well become common parlance to describe anyone who is living a repressed life, especially gay people who are unable to face the consequences of coming out - a situation which has improved since the period the film was set in but is still sadly in evidence.Patrick Bliss.",Brokeback Mountain

I knew all the hype surrounding this movie, and yes i went cause i wanted to see male on male action lol... ( i wasn't disappointed !!!).WOW- this film is a truly master in my eyes. I've given it a star rating of 9, purely because it was a bit too slow going.The acting was totally incredible, the characters soo believable. I am an open minded individual, but it made even me think about how hard it is for ppl in 2006 to be out and gay, or out and bi. In todays society its almost a done thing, ppl coming out and no one really cares. People are more tolerant. Go back 30 or 40 years and boy it must've been soo hard.This film is a work of art, it made me laugh, it made me cry.. AND BOY DID IT MADE ME CRY. I'm a sucker for romance films!.Please go and see this film, its also about education of the individual. Heath ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, played such thought provoking and enjoyable characters. Ang Lee wow he really is an amazing director. I want to buy the book, want to see this movie again. This for me is an instant hit and an all time classic. There is not that many films that I'm truly taken back! and this is one of the really rare films.

767,moviecool,An emotional love story that defied all expectations,10,9 January 2006,"For half a year, I constantly saw comments in magazines, on TV, and in newspapers, about how Jake Gyllenhal and Heath Ledger would be ""hot gay cowboys."" That's not how the movie turned out, thankfully. the movie was a love story by any normal standards, with two actors so committed to their characters that the love between Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar was that of the love between Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca. Yet the movie showed the point in a neutral but emotional fashion. It showed the prevention of love that is as normal as any love. But the movie also showed the beauty of Brokeback Mountain and captured the cowboy environment magnificently, a feat that has often been ignored.To sum it up, Ang Lee has created a masterpiece, a second Casablanca, complete with an excellent score, gorgeous cinematography, and a love that brings joy to the heart and then tears it apart. The movie captures the point of view of each character, Jack, Ennnis, and their wives, and displays how homophobia can reach everyone in our society. This movie will change you forever.",Brokeback Mountain
768,gemsstock,Best Lovefilm ever,10,24 February 2006,"Even though I read already a lot about it, I was not prepared to be so overwhelmed by this film. It really hit me only when I got out of the cinema, I just wanted to go home and be by myself. Heath Ledger as Ennis del Mar and Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist are convincing and incredible actors and Ang Lee has topped himself again after the slip with Hulk. And it's true, this is not a gay film, it is a film about deep love and two lives of missed opportunities. The moments of unspoken passion, longing glances and caring togetherness during the short moments Jack and Ennis spend together are very strong and speak the universal language of love. Annie Proulx, the author of the story gave an interview in a Swiss magazine and she said that when they suggested the film project to her, she could not imagine that a Taiwanese director could bring across this atmosphere of rural Wyoming. But when she saw the completed movie, it hit her like a hammer because she did not like to admit that a movie could be more powerful in bringing emotions across than the written word. I guess there can be no bigger compliment for a film than that.",Brokeback Mountain
769,spamtest,Haunting and Beautiful and Disturbing,10,13 February 2006,"Despite the stellar performances and the many levels of beauty in the movie, I left the theater with the vague feeling of disappointment, but I couldn't put my finger on just what it was that left me feeling that way. I thought about it all night, and actually had a bit of trouble sleeping.By morning, it finally hit me: it wasn't the movie at all that disappointed me. It was the utter unfairness and the very real despair that the characters lived with throughout the twenty years that the film spanned that haunted me.If a single frame of the movie had been different, it would be a travesty. It stayed with me because it did its job; it told an unforgettable story of a love that was doomed from the beginning and dared to be beautiful despite that.Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) accepts that things are the way they are, and nothing they do can change that. He almost convinces himself that he's content with the small snatches of happiness he and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) can share together. Jack, though, never gives up on the unrealistic and almost childlike hope that things can be different for them if they just let themselves try. Neither is right in their beliefs for what can come of the relationship, and neither is wrong. That's the greatest tragedy, and what stays with you: in the end, what they believe and who is right doesn't matter.Jake Gyllenhaal is superb, taking Jack from his more usual ebullience to his occasional but deep melancholy. Heath Ledger is nothing short of amazing, combining the subtlety of Ennis's stunted emotional state with the rare bursts of emotion that inevitably come.The cinematography is gorgeous, the script is perfect down to every single word, and the direction is outstanding. If I left the movie disappointed, it was because I was supposed to be; I was disappointed that things couldn't be different.Likewise, for the movie to tell this story with all its beauty and tragedy, it couldn't be different, and it simply couldn't be any better.",Brokeback Mountain
770,haz22,How to write a bad review for Brokeback Mountain,10,20 April 2006,"I watched this movie, but for reasons I can't put my fingers on, it left me somewhat dissatisfied. So I come to IMDb to check the reviews, especially the negative ones, to see they can help me see why I felt that way. But wow, am I surprised. Here's just a few snippets of the latest negative comments - ""For some reason the ranchers of Wyoming have been looked at as stupid inbread hillbillies by the eastren states"", ""perhaps the most immoral and evil film to come out of Hollywood"", ""most awful, pointless, boring and disgusting piece of trash"", ""boring""...Are we to think that Brokeback haters are all ill-educated oafs who can't write a coherent sentence? Or numskulls with the emotional intelligence of a gnat? Or shrinking violets who get shocked senseless by the sight of Jake making out with Heath? So here I'll try to write a negative review which I hope I can articulate my dissatisfaction, but also to help out the Brokeback haters hoping that it will inspire them to write reviews which won't make them sound like complete nitwits ----- (contains spoilers) --- Brokeback Mountain is a story of two ranch hands who met herding sheep in Wyoming in 1963. Quite unexpectedly, one drunken night, they began a sexual relationship. This lasted until their job finished and they went their separate ways. Both settled into married lives and had kids, but they resumed their relationship four years later which continued until one died many years later.This film has been described as a ""gay cowboy"" film but that is completely misleading as the theme of the film is about fear and self-repression, and how this affects love and leads to loss. The director Ang Lee made a conscious decision to make this film rather restrained, almost minimalist in its approach. This is to the detriment of the film as it means that the central relationship between the two men is only roughly sketched. We are not sure as to why there is such a strong attraction between the two, or why their relationship lasted so long. There is nary a shy smile, a furtive glance, or a whispered endearment. Perhaps the director wishes to avoid the trappings of a typical lush romantic story, but it makes the romance between the two not truly convincing. Another consequence of this is that the viewers don't feel engaged enough with the characters to empathise with their predicament. The leisurely pace at which the director tells his tale further add to the sense of ennui.The performances of the central characters are far from perfect. Jake Gyllenhaal for example has a tendency to flair his arms around like an overacting school boy at moments of heightened emotion. Some of the supporting cast are below par - both the Twist parents are not well-acted, ditto for Cassie or the Basque who is just a caricature there for comic relief. Some of the scenes, such as the fireworks scene, are unnecessary and distracting and disrupt the flow of the film. The makeup for the actors is poor, at certain scenes it is so embarrassingly obvious that it threatens to turn a tragic scene into a farce.--------- end -----One important thing, Brokeback haters must also say that they hated it so much that they stopped watching it twenty minutes before the film finished. That last twenty minutes is the reason why it got a ten, it is the emotional heart of the film and where the genius lies. It hit me sideways, sent me reeling and left me choking with grief. If you have really seen it, but are still left unmoved and gave it a vote of a one or three out of ten, then yes, you are most probably an emotional cripple, an intellectually challenged Crash fan and a complete boor.",Brokeback Mountain
771,oscarfbi,Quiet Power,10,23 December 2005,"The reason westerns have had such appeal all these years is the best of them transport you to a world where power is silent rather than shouted. Few words can display as much pain, agony, anguish and love when placed in the right hands as a 100 pages of straight dialogue. And that's what happens in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. The quiet is both the hiding and the comfort. Two young cowboys take a job shepherding sheep along the mountain and in the course find each other. Over the next twenty years that relationship affects every aspect of their lives as they continually have to make the choice between true love and marriages that were formed not of convenience but of true affection. Ang Lee has created a world that sucks you in viscerally from the first gorgeous shot and you would love to thank Avy Kaufman personally for the casting choices. Jake Gyllenhall's outwarded passion is undeniably appealing, Michelle Williams is absolutely heart-wrenching to watch (and her growth in films such as STATION AGENT has been noted), and Anne Hathaway as a spirited, wealthy Texas gal breaks any mold that PRINCESS DIARIES might have placed on her. But the movie is Heath Ledger's, who has been sadly underrated for many years, and whose intense and yet kind performance is riveting. You can feel his entire being just underneath the skin with only the skin holding him in. He would make John Wayne proud. It is not a gay cowboy movie, it is a deeply layered love story that any person is lucky to have been given a chance to watch. In life we don't always fall in love with who we are expected to. Why should that differ on film?",Brokeback Mountain
772,Cedar-4,Puzzling,2,27 December 2006,"I thought the movie was shot nicely. The scenery was spectacular but one thing bothers me........where was the indication that led up to these two guys to jump on each other? I watched the beginning of the film a few times (yes, I am a screener recipient) and I just couldn't find it. That is the one thing that spoiled the story for me. The rest of the film had no basis just because of no build up to the tent scene. Anbody else that I bring this point up with has no answer either which leads me to the conclusion that the majority of film goers really don't care to see a movie that has a 'beginning' , 'middle' or an 'end' regarding the story plot. OK.......maybe it has a beginning and an end but where in hell is the ""middle""? The ""middle"" being the build up of the relationship. So they like to herd sheep................is that it? It was just a job they took on. So everybody that has a job of herding sheep has a tendency of jumping on his/her partner??? No...........................the writers and director didn't do a very good job of this. After reading some of the other comments, I must add that I ,too, had a hard time understanding the MUMBLED dialog. Don't the studios 'get it'?? Isn't this the job of the soundman? I'd fire the S.O.B. or was it the mixing editor..........either one, the producers and director should have caught this. But a lot of this kind of thing goes on with many films. It's just plain old sloppyness and ""they"" call themselves ""professionals""........yeah, right!",Brokeback Mountain
773,trasonadanos,"""I wish I knew how to quit you.""",10,17 January 2021,"Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar are two of the best characters to ever be portrayed on the big screen. Both Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger (although straight men) provide stellar performances as a couple of cowboys in love. Ang Lee truly has done something amazing with this. Every movement and mannerism is accounted for and strategically planned. The soundtrack is perfectly imperfect, as if designed by a college film student (which doesn't detract from the film at all, but ultimately adds to the tone of unease). It's also pretty easy to forget about the film's women, but I think it's important to recognize Anne Hathaway, Michelle Williams, Kate Mara, and Linda Cardellini in their roles as very complex supporting ladies. Anne Hathaway's groans/sighs are iconic in that phone booth scene.",Brokeback Mountain
774,msmolner,Disappoointed,3,18 August 2006,"Due to all the Oscar nods, I needed to see this morning for myself. I am all for love, no matter what shape or form it comes in, but this movie left me cold. First of all, you can't understand half of what Heath Ledger is saying his accent is so bad. Jake Gyllenhall did an okay job, but the only person really worth watching is Michelle Williams. She should have had more of a part in it, then maybe the movie could have had a little more of a shake up to it. The idea was a good one, but it was tiresome and dragged in too many parts. Movies I enjoy, I will watch many times, this one I have absolutely no desire to ever watch again.",Brokeback Mountain
775,thxrvg,A Very Powerful Film,8,21 August 2006,"Throughout the film, I felt that there was something which was keeping it from being a masterpiece. It's certainly not the look or direction of the film, which are great. The film is one of the most gorgeous-looking I have ever seen; the beauty of the Teutons in Wyoming really comes through. I think the problem is that the film, although it seems sparse, tries to do too much by covering twenty years in the lives of the two men in a chronological fashion.I think the film would have been better if it had either concentrated on the Brokeback Mountain episodes, cutting the rest, or, and I think this would be better, if they started with the end and had the beginning of the film as a kind of flashback, a device which has been successfully done before.By expanding the story, we become acquainted with characters whose relationships are at least as interesting, and often more interesting, than the central one. For example, I would love to have seen more of Ennis' daughter, who is given just enough time to inform us that she has her own thoughts and feelings. Similarly, Alma is such a powerful presence that her relationship with Ennis completely trumps that of Ennis' with Jack's. What does it feel like for a girl? We get a sense of it, but it's sadly just a side-story.The worst consequence of this expansion, however, is that it takes away so much sympathy from the two characters and allocates it to the women. I didn't really feel anything but pity for the two men; I felt pity and compassion for the women. When Anna Faris' character is introduced, it's like a cup of water during a long drought. Then, we are instantly shown her husband soliciting Jack. So this sprightly, lively character is being betrayed for...what? I'm absolutely not convinced that the trade-off is a good one at all.Of course, I understand that it's about the two men being placed in an impossible position, etc. What I'm saying is that this film does not do as good a job at getting that across as it could have. It's the best one yet, because it's more or less the only one yet. It's thus more difficult to say how it will fare in comparison with future releases as opposed to a 'straight romance', but it's possible, in the name of universal love, to compare it with other films about lovers placed in difficult positions. There, the most effective films are the ones which are firmly fixated on the central love affair, because it's absolutely necessary to make sure that the audience feels for them more than it does for those around them. That is necessitated by the fact, often enough, that the relationship is one which society frowns upon. The films are thus going up against incredible social pressures. In this case, I think that is extremely true. And yet, in this very film, we have too many relationships compromising the central one.Having said that, there is too much that is done well in this film for it to be ranked below the A-level. In addition to the direction and superb cinematography, the acting is fantastic. The editing is a bit irritating, and the pacing is off in some parts (which is necessary in order to evoke the idea of boredom and mundanity), but when the film gets it right, it's dead on. The ending is very well-crafted, and the last two sequences are masterpieces in their own right. The scene with Ennis and Jack's parents is utterly devastating. The mother's eye do more to make this film tragic than any other thing in this film. What a story they tell! What pain they give an expression to! In contrast, the scene with Ennis and his daughter is bittersweet. Sweet, because there are two successful love relationships we witness (between the daughter and her soon-to-be husband, and between Ennis and his daughter). And it's bitter, because a third love relationship, between Ennis and Jack, was one which never could have brought either of the lovers the kind of happiness that the daughter excludes when she gives us that wonderful smile that acknowledges her happiness. The shirt and the picture tell us that once, it did bring them happiness. And Ennis' pain tells us that it was ephemeral. The last shot with the window tells us something else: Ennis is inside looking out. Ennis has always been inside looking out. Jack was on the threshold, desiring to get out. That difference in perspective is the central difference between the two men, and one of the main reasons behind the tragedy in the film.",Brokeback Mountain

777,mjmazzola2001,The eloquent silence of love,10,30 January 2007,"I've read here that some people cannot see love between Jack and Ennis, only lust. I feel that the power of this film is in all that was not said. BM is an intelligent film that allows us, the audience, to fill in a lot of the blanks, and that is the power of this film. Much in the way that Hitchcock in the famous shower scene of Psycho never shows the knife striking Janet Leigh, we see the blood and see her scream, but he leaves the knife penetration part up to the imagination of the audience. Each viewer reacts to their personal perception of that horror. BM succeeds in similar fashion by allowing Jack and Ennis's actions, glances, and silences, to be interpreted by our own individual perceptions. I know for me personally, the scene when Ennis opens the door to Jack's room and looks around, moved me to tears because I realized then how lonely Jack's boyhood must have been. Jack was a sensitive and beautiful young spirit growing up alone in that room, in that house, with an uneducated, primitive father, in the middle of nowhere. All of that powerful imagery conveyed to me without one word spoken. Then of course, comes the famous shirt scene in the closet. Jack truly loved Ennis, enough to keep his shirt all those years enveloped and guarded by his own shirt. All of this powerful emotion is conveyed without one word. There are no words that can describe love, so no words were necessary in this film to convey the love between Jack and Ennis, but we knew it was there because there is love in us.",Brokeback Mountain

Generally a cynic, I have to say I was taken completely by surprise. The movie is very slow moving compared to most major movies nowadays. At the beginning I wondered if I would be able to stand sitting through all of it. However, it became completely enthralling. I really was drawn into the characters of Ennis and Jack. Heath Ledger's acting was superb. It's rare to empathize so deeply with a character in movies these days, like you do with Ennis. The cinematography was beautiful. Seeing it on the big screen I really felt I was sitting on the Wyoming mountain watching them.

The movie is way too predictable and the acting is sub-par. I still don't understand how it was nominated for best picture at the Oscars. But what I hate most about this movie is that if you don't like it you are homophobic. I strongly support gay rights, as a matter of fact I have some gay friends and a gay family member. Just because someone hates this movie doesn't mean they are homophobic, it just means they hate this movie. To me this movie did nothing to help homosexuals, to me they were betrayed as people who pose as straight and have affairs. Not a good betrayal of people who need good representation.

782,toddyj1971,Good Movie but is it really a true love story?,7,12 January 2006,"I have had a week to process my thoughts toward Brokeback Mountain and I am ready to share them. First let me say that it is a good movie with phenomenal acting (even Ana Faris' little role is great) and beautiful scenery. Heath, Jake and Michelle will get Oscar nominations and I think Michelle will win (her category tends to like the young ones). The story is unique and it did captivate me. It is my #5 movie of the year behind Chronicles of Narnia, Crash, Walk the Line and King Kong.However, I have one big problem with the movie...is it truly a love story? What I mean by this is that it seems to be more about sex than love. Their relationship is never developed in the beginning and then bang, they do it! When they see each other after 4 years, all they want to do is have sex! Sex is not love, it is only a part of a loving relationship. Jack Twist even says that he has to go to Mexico to get what he can't get from Ennis on a regular basis (again, sex!). I never really believed that they were in love as much as I saw a pure physical attraction and relationship.That is my main problem with the movie because it is being marketed as a love story and it really isn't one. It is about 2 men who are attracted to each other physically and they act on it for a 20 year period. The other thing is if Jack really loved Ennis, why couldn't he remain faithful? He only wanted to be satisfied sexually.I have been married for over 5 years and I love to be intimate with my wife but there is so much more to marriage than just the physical part. The movie never developed their love but only the physical attraction. As a conservative Christian, I do not agree with the homosexual lifestyle. The movie actually developed what I believe to be the reason why both men struggled with it. They had bad fathers growing up and they were just looking for the love of a man to replace the lack of love they received from their fathers. I am sure some of you will disagree with me but I have to be honest.Overall, I enjoyed the movie but I would tell someone that it is an extremely sad and haunting movie.",Brokeback Mountain
783,theslayer2112,Beautiful film and a wonderful performance by Heath Ledger,9,20 May 2016,"In my opinion, Heath Ledger deserved the Oscar for this movie. His role was deeply moving and makes the viewer experience emotions for it is what is - a love story. My not being homosexual did not prevent me from being moved in two of the most emotional scenes in the story - one where Heath and Jake fight in their last meeting and the very last scene.This is my point of view as well as in response to a few claiming they did not understand as they could not see it from the point of view of a homosexual. You don't have to be a gay man to understand the love portrayed in this story and you don't need to be straight in order to understand love.This movie was as much about love as it was about the main characters being males and being in love with each other. DO NOT make it a homosexual movie and see it for what it is - a love story and a brilliant and moving performance by one of the best actors that we are fortunate enough to have witnessed and whom the world lost oh-so- soon!I could not get around to watching this movie all this while and when I finally did earlier today, I was thoroughly impressed. This is what happens when a wonderful story gets told by a brilliant director who brings the characters to life on screen with the help of talented actors, not just Heath and Jake but the supporting cast too did a brilliant job. Absolutely a must watch, the background score blends in wonderfully and accentuates the emotions on screen.",Brokeback Mountain

785,bczech,So what?,6,2 May 2006,"With all the lavishing of praise on this film I was expecting something spectacular. The subdued cinematography was excellent and the portrayals were wonderful (even the mushed-mouth lines of Heath Ledger) but the film left me wondering what it was all about.In a typical love story there is a certain amount of build up, a certain amount of care and planning. Yearning and care. There was non of that. The story went from 2 cowboys herding sheep, to a wham bam sex scene and then a bunch of wandering and muted yearning.Honestly, I have seen more tenderness in an episode of OZ then in this movie. While I believe there are some redeeming efforts I found that there was so much unspoken (Randy Quaid's 'picking up"" on the situation by 2 single and very brief visits to camp -- and the one encounter between the cowboys is supposed to telegraph a great passion) The only true glimpse I saw of Jack's care for Ennis was when Jack was not even on the screen. It was from Jack's mother that I got an inkling of Jack's passion for Ennis.A movie like this could have been great, a 10, but I find it hard to stick with the 6 I am giving it. The only good thing is that when Hollywood has something that makes money they will remake it and maybe then they can get it right.",Brokeback Mountain

What a marvelous piece of work from director Ang Lee. I cannot stress to you the impact that this film has on your being. After leaving the theatre, I was flooded with a series of overpowering emotions; sympathy, regret, love, and above all...admiration. Admiration for the solid performances both Jake and Heath pulled off in this timeless masterpiece.Brokeback Mountain is not just a ""gay cowboy movie."" It is a story about a raw, powerful love that two lonesome cowboys find within the midst of Brokeback Mountain. It's about letting go of the one person you love the most, it's about life. I can only shake my head in dismay at the people who will go see this movie with a closed mind. I can only hope that they will leave the theatre with a better understanding of what true love means.For those of you with a soft spot for true cinematic magic, I offer you this bit of advice; bring tissue...lots of it.

789,Blite2000,Not as good as it could have been and far too long,6,14 January 2006,"Well, I'd read the short story and had been waiting for this movie to come out for nigh on a year and a half with eager anticipation so don't expect a diatribe of gay-hate from this direction (I'm gay). Unfortunately, though, I have to say that I didn't take to Brokeback Mountain as well as some/many.The story, such as it is (there's a reason it was written as a short story), covers the love between Ennis Del Mar (quiet, brooding closet gay cowboy) and Jack Twist (more lively closet gay cowboy), from the initial passions they share on Brokeback Mountain to the emergence of their (separate) family lives and their attempts to keep what they share going as they head towards a tragic end. And that's really *all* the story is - two guys, one more repressed than the other, in love. To me the main problem with the movie is that it takes this very simple theme and tries to flesh it out by adding vast sections dealing with each character's family situation. I'm not convinced it works - by spending so much time *not* dealing with the relationship between Jack and Ennis the film loses focus and it clouds both the flow of the tale and, ultimately, the emotional punch it packs.The film also suffers from something I didn't expect: a focus on sex at the expense of affection. I've read this in another review, so it's apparently not just me, but I find it hard to understand why Lee chose to concentrate on the sex and violence between Jack and Ennis but shied away from showing *affection* at any point. It's hard to feel the love between the characters when every opportunity there is to reveal it is forsaken (for instance, we see the Jack and Ennis waking up in their tent wrapped around each other for all of three seconds, there are moments of horseplay which serve as a poor substitute and, *SPOILER* at the very end we finally catch a glimpse of a hug). Close to the end of the film there are a handful of scenes where the sheer power of emotion these two feel for each other is finally (and magnificently) credible, but otherwise it seems overwhelmingly to be sex and punches. I have no problem with seeing a lot of sex, but aren't these characters supposed to feel something other than anger and lust, too? The other gripe I'd have at Brokeback is that it's simply far, far, far, FAR too long and the plot can't sustain it. This is particularly conspicuous at the beginning. Lee - very uncharacteristically (compare, e.g. The Ice Storm) - goes for the wide, beautiful scenery approach for almost fifteen minutes of screen time in which very little characterisation takes place and, frankly, very little else relevant happens, either. Yes, the mountains are beautiful but there's a limit. And it's in this initial segment that the very odd choices the filmmakers have made in terms of what to give time to are most apparent: we have the overkill of vista shots eating up time (including a pretty shot of the clouds in the sky - which comes out of nowhere for no apparent reason), then *SPOILER* Jack and Ennis get to drinking in the early evening. Suddenly, the sky is black, hours have passed, and they're about to go to bed together for the first time. What?! Is it not necessary for the audience to witness what would have been the dialogue which could have made the whole relationship credible? Right from this excruciatingly slow (and wrong-footed) start the film is handicapped in time terms. The midsection meanders almost aimlessly and the ending, which *is* emotionally intense, feels very abrupt in comparison.Finally, the new (compared to the book) family element to the ending presumably is intended to give us the idea that Ennis isn't shirking away from his fears any more. Trouble is, it was never really Ennis's family that Ennis was shirking away from. So it's hard to see how it's relevant in any way (maybe Jack's made him a good man?). It might have been better to leave it with the Ennis's discovery of the shirt (the significance of which has been muddied by the expansion of the family sub-plots).All this is not to say that I hated Brokeback. There are some major plus points: the movie is beautifully shot; the acting is universally fabulous, including every single bit player; the final scenes are intense and heartbreaking (although if you've already read the story I suspect they lose some of their power); the score is wonderful. It's just a bit of a disappointment that it doesn't quite work the way it could have done.",Brokeback Mountain
790,AndrewRobertsVoice,'Brokeback Mountain' explores the complexity of love with disarming freshness,9,6 February 2006,"I heard '""Brokeback Mountain"" is A gay western' from a paranoid homophobic man who was acting like the wrath of God, convinced that anyone who went to see 'Brokeback Mountain' is gay. More ferociously he claimed to believe if one weren't gay when one went in, you would be when you...exit the theater. I won the bet that he was a card carrying Republican, not that there is anything wrong with that...just my casual an keen observation of a poker face. (no pun intended) I remember when I heard the term, 'a gay western', I thought 'Oh Great, just what the world needs!"" as I started to imagine a Tim Curry-esqe 'Rocky Horror Picture Show-like' version of ""Rio Bravo"", ""Red River"", ""The War Wagon"", ""Big Jake"", and ""The Train Robbers"". The homosexual innuendos in these are unintentional, I'm sure! I can almost see it vividly, there they are tough guys one an all, talking like over the top bad actors acting like a sissy boy with not one good thing to say about a woman! It's peculiar how they give their horses high grades and better treatment! There will be no need to ever wonder what exactly those cowboys did to pull themselves through a cold and lonely night being as there were no women around for miles. Only men, alone, cold and scared are the sheep! Normally, when there was a beautiful woman, the Cowboy didn't know what to do with her, 'no damn way!' But, when he's got his horse, his dog and a penis extension in his hand and he knows exactly what to do! ""Brokeback Mountain"" is NOT about all that! This is a beautiful and daring film about the complexities in the dichotomy of love in the human being. This film is a superb showcase of provocative freshness from a fine director such is Ang Lee, and excellent cinematographer like Rodrigo Prieto and intense actors, all down with their chops, presenting the portrayal of the people in relationships of two men! Suffice to say, this film brings out the ugliest homophobia in men, (defining 'Homophobia' as fear-based core beliefs of men who are so insecure with their own sexuality, they 'act out', some resort to verbal abuse, some violence and some even murder homosexuals.) The ultra-insecure I have casually noticed hide behind the 'God' character in a religious based book, that quite a few have a strange, weird and wacky interpretations of! {I'm still trying to get over how the dinosaur skeletons in the Smithsonian in DC are delusions or figments of my imagination merely because they got no mention in their bible. However, this supports the theory of long-term mental effects of inbreeding since Adam and Eve, explaining a hell of a lot of human behavior!} It's too damn bad God has a problem with a superb showcase of Something different for a change! I feel it is a gosh-darn shame that God can't accept in His tiny little mind that the characters, too, were made in the image and likeness of Himself. That said, since God has a problem with what finally does what a voice of ART is supposed to do & gets people talking, then God obviously doesn't have a damn clue! So, God needs to sit on his hands in the corner to keep his bile filled fingers from stroking his keyboard or he'll end up screwing himself out of seeing a masterpiece of modern film-making! If there is anything for the 'American God' to get riled up about, it ought to be how Canada doubled for Wyoming, not that there is anything wrong with Canada. It's All-American 'out sourcing' to be proud of!",Brokeback Mountain

A metaphor for what you should do in life: Don't let opportunities pass you by. No matter what, love rules our lives and our decisions. Jack Twist knew what he wanted and never got it. Enis del Mar, wasn't sure and lost it forever. The supposedly undertone works marvelously since all the inner feelings are for the audience to feel.

793,buystuff1_855,The Blind Men and the (Brokeback) Elephant,9,20 February 2006,"Putting aside for a moment whether ""Brokeback Mountain"" is or is not a good movie, it has certainly stirred up a fascinating (and in some cases, disturbing) range of conflicting reactions. Reading the various reviews, I keep thinking of the old parable of the blind men and the elephant: one grabs hold of the trunk and thinks an elephant is like a snake, one grabs a leg and thinks an elephant is like a tree, another feels the body and thinks an elephant is like a wall, etc. (In the case of ""Brokeback Mountain,"" there are also some who've never touched the elephant at all but are nevertheless adamant that it must be a foul and disgusting creature!) Frankly, I'm more than a little puzzled by the intense controversy surrounding an Academy Award nominated film dealing with homosexual content within a decade of a movie such as ""Boys Don't Cry,"" and a couple of decades after ""The Crying Game"" and ""Kiss of the Spider Woman"" (not to mention FORTY YEARS after ""Midnight Cowboy""!). By now, can't we all accept that it is possible to make good, artistic, meaningful films about the human condition that deal with homosexuality? And isn't the only ""agenda"" that really matters whether or not the treatment is honest? ""Brokeback Mountain,"" both Annie Proulx' short story and the movie adaptation, is an attempt to create an honest, powerful but starkly unromantic love story. Two macho ranch hands find themselves caught up in a profound and inescapable love for each other that is the great passion of their lives. For reasons both personal and cultural, they are never able to come to terms with it. Their needs, their desires, and their responsibilities are in conflict for the rest of their lives, and the imperfect decisions they make have painful consequences for themselves and their families. Apart from the obvious requirement of at least a minimal amount of open-mindedness toward the subject matter, the movie requires that a viewer be able to respond to a love story without the traditional romantic elements; to a pacing that is often slow and langorous (which allows the environment to mirror and magnify the emotions of the characters); to reticent characters who are uncomfortable and usually awkward at expressing their real feelings; and to drama that is often conveyed through non-verbal communication and what ISN'T being said. (In my case, it was also necessary to shrug off a couple of false-note scenes -- such as Ennis heroically punching out the grotesque biker on the 4th of July, or Jack putting his obnoxious father-in-law in his place at Thanksgiving -- which seemed too contrived and stereotypical to fit in with the stark realism of the rest of the story.) For those of us who touch this aspect of ""Brokeback Mountain,"" it is a great tragic love story: original, honest and extremely moving (and also the best film nominated for an academy award this year). If enough people respond to ""Brokeback Mountain"" in this way, it will be regarded in years to come as one of the few classic American films of this era.",Brokeback Mountain
794,zundays,So much more than romance,10,8 March 2006,"Hollywood excels at representing romance, seduction and thrill. But Ang Lee sets himself a higher goal with this movie. Brokeback Mountain is a story of love, simple requited love, but one of the most inspiring and enduring kind. Although the obstacles the lovers meet are important, their love is not really put to the test. It is the ineffectual and fatal way they face these obstacles that the movie tells the story of. Although they love each other with the same irrepressible urge, Ennis and Jack have been affected very differently by the prejudices of their society. Whereas Ennis has an overwhelming sense of duty and makes a habit of keeping his desires under control, Jack cannot deny his impulses. Ennis's sense of responsibility to his community and Jack's way of dealing with grief and loss will work on separating them in a society that pits duty against desire. And Lee is a master at illustrating the manifold ways human beings give rein to their contradictory emotions. While Ennis at times gives way to violent outbursts, Jack quits the game early and surrenders his life to chance. The movie deals with the impossibility of resolving these differences in a society that opposes their love. With the logic simplicity of a tale and visual intelligence, Brokeback Mountain characterizes for example the wives according to their contrasted relationships with their spouses. But the incredible soberness of the ending leaves the viewer with an optimistic sense that love is all powerful despite the violence that so often surrounds it.",Brokeback Mountain
795,jmmendoza,A Story That Will Remain In Our Hearts Forever,10,29 August 2013,"The movie reminds us that life is way too short to hold back our feelings and not get what we want, even if it's in front of us. Time lapses fast. It reminds us to always grab the opportunity of getting something we want, or we'll regret it for life when it's gone.Jack always wanted to live with Ennis, but Ennis will always refuse to come with him, for he is afraid to admit himself as a homosexual. His bad memory in his past where his dad made him sure to witness a man who's been killed for being gay holds back his passion for Jack. But what I'm assure of, is his love for Jack is truly undeniable.It was too late when Ennis finally decided to meet with Jack and come with him. Jack died in an accident. If only Ennis didn't hold back his feelings, they both should've been happy with their lives. Jack's ashes were scattered in Brokeback Mountain, as he said ""it was his favorite place"". Now, Ennis lives alone, and only Jack's blood-stained shirt is what he has.It is natural in one's life to have obstacles, but we can't let these fear us, fight our feelings and win over our dreams. Bad memories should be left in the past for they belong there, and should not be carried in the present. Thinking positively will surely let us be happy with our lives. Acceptance in one's self will set us free from worries, and will let us live a happier life. Nobody's perfect. Even if it's Ennis' fault, it served as a lesson for him and for everyone to grasp our dreams, if it's reachable, ahead of time, and don't ever let it go away, or we'll regret it. I was so affected when I saw this movie. I can't even sleep thinking about it still. It broke my heart, really. It is by far the best drama movie I've ever seen in my life. I was moved by it's realness and I'll always remember this movie forever.. :'( Thankyou so much, Annie Proulx for your heart-warming story! And to Ang Lee, the director of the film. The pair up of Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger is just perfect for this film. They both are superb actors, whose emotions are very real and I can see that they are really passionate of what they're doing. But I was saddened by the fact that Heath Ledger passed away due to overuse of pills. R.I.P. Heath Ledger, you will be missed. You are and will remain as a legend forever...",Brokeback Mountain
796,burntime-1,Ang Lee's latest movie is a universal story of love and longing.,10,17 January 2006,"Based on Annie Proulx's short story of the same name (first published in The New Yorker in 1997) Brokeback Mountain is the latest feature film from Taiwanese-born director Ang Lee, who also directed The Ice Storm, The Wedding Banquet and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. It tells the story of 19 year old ranch hand Ennis del Mar (Australian actor Heath Ledger) and young rodeo rider Jack Twist (Donnie Darko's Jake Gyllenhaal), who meet in the summer of 1963 while herding sheep on a Wyoming mountainside. Inarticulate, ill-educated, and already bruised by the harsh lives they have led to date, the youths soon find their forced intimacy developing into a bond that neither is prepared for, and which in the milieu in which they live, is almost unthinkable. ""You know I ain't queer,"" Ennis tells his companion soon after the drunken night when the two young men first have sex. ""Hell, I ain't neither,"" Jack replies. Given the brutal real-life murder of gay youth Matthew Shepherd in rural Wyoming more than 30 years later, their reticence to accept the truth at such a time, and in such a place, is more than understandable.Once the summer is over the two men separate, and in the coming years both marry and struggle to raise their respective families in a series of deft, economic scenes that flesh out many events only briefly alluded to in Proulx's original story. Most notably the screenwriters, Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, have breathed life into the personalities of the women the two men marry: Ennis' hopeful young wife Alma (former Dawson's Creek star Michelle Williams) and the feisty rodeo rider Lureen Newsome (Anne Hathaway). Both women turn in remarkable performances, displaying nuance and subtlety in underplayed roles that perfectly match Ang Lee's deft directorial tone. Despite the new lives they have built for themselves, Jack and Ennis cannot forget their love for each another. When they reunite four years after first meeting, their brief affair is rekindled into the sort of epic romance that Hollywood myths are made of. Like all great love stories, from Romeo and Juliet to Titanic, it is a romance that, ultimately, results in tragedy. Unlike most films, which spoon-feed information to their audiences through awkward and expository dialogue, Brokeback Mountain assumes its audience's intelligence, and tells its story largely through glance and gesture. While some might complain that the film lacks passion, as its male leads never once speak the words ""I love you,"" to one another, their longing eyes speak volumes for those who are prepared to look for such messages. Similarly its pace, while slow by the standard of contemporary blockbusters, allows the story time to mature in such a way that its inexorable climax, when it arrives, is devastating. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto ensures that the film's lyrical images perfectly contrast its taut structure, while director Ang Lee has coaxed some of the most memorable performances in recent years from his young cast. Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist provides the perfect balance of enthusiasm and bewilderment, while Heath Ledger conveys all the fear, anger and love that his character is unable to express verbally through his tightly-controlled physical performance. Brokeback Mountain is a masterful example of film-making, presenting a story and characters that will haunt you long after the movie has ended. Although the insecure and the ignorant will dismiss it as 'a gay cowboy movie,' the tale it tells is universal, and will resonate with anyone, gay or straight, man or woman, who has ever yearned for a love that lay just out of reach. Brokeback Mountain is that rare example of a film in which every separate element combines to form a faultless whole, and I have no hesitation in declaring it one of the first true masterpieces of 21st century cinema.",Brokeback Mountain
797,Christoph-Matiss,An important film that makes (film) history,10,9 August 2006,"Well, to be honest, it wasn't easy for me to vote ""Brokeback Mountain"" a ""10"" and I'm sure I hadn't done so 24 hours ago. But after having seen this masterpiece for a second time yesterday evening there remains nothing else but that.The film contains wonderful landscape, two brilliant leading actors (and of course a bunch of great supporting actors), beautifully sad music and, most importantly, a very powerful and innovative story. There were lots of efforts to present homosexual topics in the younger film history but none like that. Two cowboys in the near prototypical Western provincial backwater which stands for conservative attitudes and intolerance. The ways in which one can handle this situation may differ and are (perfectly) exemplified by Ennis and Jack.Because this is a very brave and, as I already said, new way to approach the topic ""Brokeback Mountain"" deserves its status as ""The gay Western"" and will go down in (film) history.Film lovers, don't miss it!",Brokeback Mountain
798,bryden2000,Almost perfect,8,10 January 2015,"This film is one of the most underrated films ever made, most probably because the internet is filled with homophobia. From the director of suck films as his best director winning life of pi and crouching tiger hidden dragon, for which he won best the foreign film Oscar. Ang lee won best director for his work in this film, and it was definitely earned, it shows off the beautiful scenery of Canada (I think). Though this is no citizen Kane, and it doesn't have a major plot, it is still considered by many as a pure masterpiece. The reason the movie only deserves an eight is the fact that it differs from no other romance film, it's simply the two lovers are forbidden to love, blah, blah, blah. It's pretty generic, I consider it the 3rd most snubbed best picture winner (after citizen Kane and the pianist). My question is, if this movie was about a straight romance. Would it have had such acclaim? In short no, but the fact is the movie isn't about straight people, it's about the struggle of homosexuality acceptance, since we're changing main plots in films, why not make planet of the apes about monkeys coming to earth? Or have Marlon Brando as Jim in rebel without a cause. Jake gyllenhaal deserved best supporting actor over colonel, ledger deserved best actor of Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and best picture over crash.",Brokeback Mountain

Heath ledger's best performance I have ever seen.This movie will stir up conflicting emotions and this will make many people uncomfortable. Heath and Jake's characters are about as manly as you can get, rugged cowboys, and it makes it hard for the viewer to accept what they are seeing.Absolutely brilliant!I had the privilege of going to the Premier and speaking with Ang, the writer, and the producers. This movie is not about making money, this movie is about being a catalyst for change. Heath went from this set directly to film Casanova.

801,wizzaroot,"Very enjoyable, and quite moving",9,28 January 2006,"Let me start by saying that I really liked it. The acting was great overall, and the dialog/plot seemed believable. Also, if you're the type that is still a little uncomfortable watching homosexual situations, you shouldn't be afraid to see this movie...It was tastefully done.As far as the acting, my favorite performance would have to be that of Michelle Williams. She brought such emotion and pure feeling to that part. Her performance was sincere and moving. Anne Hathaway was equally great, but with a more subdued character. She was the type that acted as if nothing could touch her, that she had everything in control, and in the end, you witness the pain that was always there...she really made it work. Randy Quaid was just as impressive. He showed yet another facet of his acting talent. His character was dead on. I know men like him, and he hit the nail on the head. Jake Gyllenhaal was brilliant as always. He is one of my favorites since Donnie Darko, and he just has an extreme and inspiring talent for acting. The only complaint here for me is Heath Ledger. He was not horrible, but I found the accent, and mannerisms a little rehearsed. I just didn't buy it. He was a non-cowboy trying to act like a cowboy...it's just the general feeling I got.Some people on the site are complaining of a slow moving story, and that nothing really happens. I even heard some comments to that same effect on my way out of the theater. The fact is, this is really an all out drama. The basic story of a group of people and the hardships they endure through a number of years. I'm not sure what everyone is expecting to happen. If you like tons of action, murder and mayhem, graphic sexuality, or other in your face types of themes, then you won't enjoy this. But...if you're like me, and you enjoy seeing everyday people facing the challenges of life, and struggling to find happiness, then you'll be in awe.As for the sexuality, I don't judge people on it, but I have to admit, I was a little uncomfortable during a few of the love scenes. I will say though, that I thought they were tastefully done, leaving a lot to the imagination...which, for my taste, is more enjoyable...whether it is gay or straight.That sums it up! I was very impressed with this movie!",Brokeback Mountain
802,socact-1,Slowly but undeniably arresting,9,3 January 2006,"When I left the theater after seeing this film, I hardly thought I had seen an exceptional movie, much less the best picture of the year. But ""Brokeback Mountain"" has a way of sinking in as the hours, and then the days, pass by. I found myself talking about it twenty minutes before midnight on New Year's, screaming in my boyfriend's ear over deafening music and drunken conversations. It's that kind of movie.The film is blessed with a gifted cast who play their parts to perfection. I admit I expected to see the Heath Ledger I knew from ""A Knight's Tale,"" but fortunately that guy is nowhere to be found. Ledger infuses a subtlety and sadness into Ennis Del Mar that brings the movie to a whole other level. Unlike Jack Twist, Ennis seems to accept the facets of his existence that make him different, despite every attempt to blend into a non-descript, ordinary life. Jake Gyllenhaal, the man with a plan, delivers a moving and convincing performance as Ennis' lover. His forwardness serves as a perfect complement to Ennis' taciturn reluctance. And Michelle Williams, as Ennis' wife, finally has the opportunity to prove her acting talents - which were evident in Dawson's Creek - to a larger and more receptive audience.""Brokeback Mountain"" is a poignant, simple, and beautiful love story. Walking into the theater, I might have injected ""gay"" somewhere in that description, but this film transcends gender and sexuality. Yes, the story is a sad one, but I never felt terribly sorry for Ennis or Jack. They found something that most people spend their lifetimes searching for. Perhaps ""Brokeback Mountain"" will be regarded as a landmark ""gay film,"" a sign of enlightened attitudes and modern times. And maybe it is that. But even without the cultural hype surrounding this film, the love story that defines the characters and shapes their lives is a universal theme. Ennis and Jack wanted only what they couldn't have. And who can't relate to that?",Brokeback Mountain

It was heartbreaking in the end and I teared up from Ennis' discovery of his and Jack's shirt in Jack's room and the end when Ennis was alone and buttoned Jack's shirt.Heath and Jake should have won Oscars for their amazing performances. They really stepped outside of themselves and were very believable as Western cowboys. I thought their western accents were great.I kept thinking about this movie after it was over and this is one of the saddest and best movies I've seen since Love Story.

806,TajMahal2000,A Classic Masterpiece,10,1 May 2006,"I have now seen this film three times and each time I discover something new that moves me or emotionally devastates me. To be dubbed as 'the gay cowboy film' does this masterpiece little justice. It is a beautiful love story and by way of a refreshing change it is between two people of the same sex. Heath Ledger's performance as the repressed Ennis Del Mar is simply breathtaking. His pain and sadness, expressed with few and often inaudible words is truly moving, raw and very very real. You just want to reach out and hug him. Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Williams give equally moving performances. Well done to Ang Lee, Annie Proulx and the rest of the crew who helped bring this masterpiece to the cinema. Which brings me to this: What were the Academy thinking of awarding 'Crash' the Best Picture over 'Brokeback Mountain'? This reminds me of another well known and equally criminal travesty from years ago - this time courtesy of the British pop charts - when the classic single 'Vienna' by Ultravox was kept out of No.1 by the appalling Joe Dolce single 'Shaddap You Face'. The only difference being that Joe Dolce has more credibility than Crash! (Ouch!)",Brokeback Mountain

808,tambourine33,meh.....,5,27 April 2006,"For a movie that received this much hype, I think it was a little bit of a let down. I had been waiting for this great ""forbidden romance"" but it just didn't grab me like that.If I was being completely honest, (I know I'm gonna get shot for this) if ""Brokeback"" had been about a straight couple, it would not have got the attention it has received. It is one of the few mainstream films, if any, that dare to showcase a homosexual relationship. However it should not lean so heavily on that fact. Both of the central characters are extremely self-centred and in the case of Ennis, (Ledger) bordering on the myopic. Any parent who finds his partner at work, dumps a baby and toddler on them to go and have an affair is below contempt. When his wife questioned him about him sexuality, he left without even acknowledging his two young children. Jack (Gylehall) seemed more interested in the carnal side of relationships, first by preying on Ennis in the opening scenes, then on first meeting his wife and finally by his forays into Mexico.Heath Ledger puts in a good performance as Ennis and the film is directed well, but for me, it is too hard to find sympathy with the two main characters. It is also pretty slow moving, predictable and relies on the ""gay"" factor.",Brokeback Mountain
809,keyslaw2,Leaves you thinking....,8,27 January 2006,"When I panned ""Capote"" (""Movie About Writing of 'In Cold Blood' is Cold Potatoes""), I said that the message of a good movie does not come from a line delivered to or by the protagonist but is made obvious in more subtle ways. Those who wrote, produced, and directed ""Brokeback Mountain"" apparently think along the same lines.To me, ""Brokeback Mountain"" has a simple but powerful message: Live the life you want. Don't be afraid to love. Nobody actually says those words, but the closing scene--in which we see Ellis as a lonely and broken man--serves as a warning to all who fail to heed. I, for one, intend to think long and hard about that.If there is anything to criticize about this film, it's that the opening scenes make the movie's gay theme a little too obvious. It would be better to allow the audience to assume at the beginning that the characters were straight and that a sexual relationship between them wasn't in the works. A movie should build up to a love scene gradually. In all things dealing with love, delay is part of the thrill.Although homosexuals have been depicted in movies for years now, they are usually cast in a comedic role in which their homosexuality stands out as different or oddball. ""Brokeback Mountain,"" on the other hand, boldly makes a movie about homosexuals without making an issue out of homosexuality. I say it's about time.""Brokeback Mountain"" is bold in another way: unlike the majority of mainstream movies, it doesn't rely on juvenile sex jokes or a toilet flush to keep the audience's attention. Perhaps it is written for the above-average crowd and because of this, it may gather its trophies but suffer in receipts. Nevertheless, I give two thumbs up for a mature movie at last.",Brokeback Mountain
810,speedhumps,Question re Ennis' daughter.,9,28 December 2005,"I do not understand why Ennis's daughter came to announce her engagement, because it occurred amid the devastating climax after Ennis learned about Jack and immediately before the last scene. BBM is a great film rolling toward Oscar. Why, then, this distracting scene unrelated to the central issue? I don't recall it in the short story so what was the purpose? If you know, please share with me. Or, do you agree with me that Larry McMutry went out of control at the end? And, did he have to get approval from Ang Lee and Annie Proulx for this incredible error?

811,matt21480,One of the best of the year...,10,12 January 2006,"""Brokeback Mountain"" by Ang Lee is an exercise in acting and subtle moments. There have been few films that have portrayed homosexuality and for that matter male sexuality with such honesty and intensity. Heath Ledger (as Ennis Del Mar) gives a terrific performance of a man lost in world where he doesn't quite know what he wants or how to show it. The amazing part of Ledger's performance is the subtle nature of the role itself. The character is a like a firecracker of emotions both seen and unseen. This is what gives ""Brokeback Mountain"" its core. This is not just a film about homosexuality, it is a film about love, longing and the ability (or lack thereof) in displaying love and it is one of the best films of 2005.",Brokeback Mountain

813,fariceislands,Brokeback Mountain - shackled by its origins,5,23 January 2006,"NB - IF YOU WANT TO MISS THE CRIT AND SPOILERS, SKIP TO LAST PARAGRAPH. The first problem came within the first 20 minutes, when I was not able to understand the dialogue. The accents may have been accurate, but in an attempt at gruff macho realism, all the actors were initially unintelligible. I began to think that I would have to view the movie again on DVD with the subtitles on. Fortunately, either my ear became attuned, or changes occurred after viewing the rushes Although matters improved, I realise my initial annoyance may have affected my enjoyment of the whole.As to the 'gay' theme, I must give the producers, director and actors credit for dealing with this issue in such ultra conservative days. However, for me, this was not so much a story of two gays who 'found' each other, as two kindred spirits who found in each other the tenderness and unspoken understanding they had never found with anyone else, not even their respective spouses. Coming from similar backgrounds and lonely childhoods, their love often seemed not so much sex as and expression of rage against the world and a refusal to deal with the issues in their respective pasts. This is particularly true of Ennis (Ledger) who clearly loves his wife and children, but knows deep down that Jack (Gyllenhaal), is his true soul-mate.Certain inconsistencies in the plot and structure pulled this film down, while others raised the level. I found the manner in which Ennis' wife Alma discovers the truth about her husband implausible. Having been so discreet and secretive. I did not believe that both men would act in such a way even after several years. A more serious flaw was the fact that Alma only challenges Ennis about his relationship long after their divorce. That's not even mentioning his sudden violence towards her. While I can believe he could have stormed out and taken out his rage on a stranger, his ambiguity and confusion was such throughout, that I did not believe he would have suddenly man handled her as if he were in a barroom brawl.Before this scene, I thought the director Ang Lee was being subtle and clever by not spelling out the reason for the divorce, allowing the viewer to believe that they had stayed together for the sake of their young children. Thus, this largely plausible scene was made entirely implausible by poor placement in the narrative. Whether it was an error in the script or in the editing is not clear, but I would have expected better from both Ang Lee and the screenwriter Larry McMurtry.However, there is one gem of a scene that both coveys the very heart of the film and shows the true genius of the director Ang Lee. If anyone wants to know how to convey everything without words, watch the scene between Ennis and Jack's parents. The father is boorish and homophobic, while the mother conveys understanding, acceptance and forgiveness, all by giving a touch, a nod, and a glance.The sublime simplicity and perfection of this scene made me ache for the rest of the film to match it, yet sadly it did not. With the exception of Jack's mother, played by Roberta Maxwell, the performances were solid rather than outstanding. As one who has never understood the allure of Heath Ledger, while his performance was at times affecting, at others it was merely ordinary. Perhaps that is not his fault; while Jack had a certain spontaneous, reckless charm, Ennis was largely taciturn and sullen, seemingly only coming alive in scenes with his daughter.(Anne Hathaway).If it were not for the fact that both characters were men, the repression and denial conveyed would be nothing out of the ordinary. Maybe that is the point, Jack and Ennis are soul mates whom Fate has deemed would be two men instead of man and woman. This story asks us to consider what is love, and Ang Lee allows us, the viewer, to answer that question. Our answer can be profound or glib according to our mood and point of view, and while this ambiguous device often works on the page, it does not sit so well on film, at least not for me. The repression of Ennis' emotions ultimately distanced me from caring for these men. By contrast, the brief appearance of Jack's mother and her silent expression of quiet agony made me wonder more about her life than Ennis' in the years beyond the story's end. Surely not the emphasis intended.The film Brokeback Mountain, taken from a short story by E Annie Proulx, never manages to wrest itself from its limited origins. In 129 minutes we are presented with what is in essence a one premise plot line, and it is simply too slim either to draw us in, or ultimately make us care about the main characters. I appreciate films which make me want to see them again. I've seen Brokeback Mountain, and sadly for such a fine director as Ang Lee and screen writers, Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana - once is definitely enough.",Brokeback Mountain

Jake in particular is outstanding and your heart just breaks for Michelle. Heath also gives an incredible performance.

An excellent cast, fine direction by Ang Lee and words simply cannot describe the cinematography. I have tried on several occasions to watch this movie. In the movie theater, on premium TV, on DVD. All times I have fallen asleep halfway through the movie.I loved the original story. I think though in the execution of the film, that at some point they made a wee bit *too* esoteric. The music is beautiful and haunting, the breathtaking cinematography, the completely understated fine performances of Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger, combined are way over the top. It will lull you into a trance.Go to see Brokeback Mountain and it will haunt you. But bring a blanket, a pillow, and some Breathright strips. Movie Theater audiences hate it when you snore.",Brokeback Mountain
819,MaxStarr,A film that will never grow old.,10,3 May 2006,"I've watched countless films  the good and the bad  and I think I can count on two hands the number of films I've seen that possess the power to stay with the viewer long after the final credits roll. This is one of those films.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, both fine, capable actors, have reached down into some wondrous place within their souls and given us truly heartbreaking and vividly unforgettable characters. Ledger simply takes the film, tucks it tightly under his arm, and walks off with it. He so thoroughly embraces the role of the drawling, tormented, taciturn Ennis Del Mar that it is somewhat of a shock to see and hear him articulate (in his native Australian accent) in the DVD's bonus features. Could this possibly be the same person we saw moments earlier in the film?Likewise, Gyllenhaal, who is building up an impressive and diverse resume of films, is seemingly poised to become one of our most gifted actors working today. Witness the scene where his feisty, opinionated Jack Twist sets out to visit Ennis, under the mistaken belief that Ennis's divorce has opened the door to a long-awaited and now-unobstructed relationship. In this segment he goes from an ecstatic cowpoke belting out a line of Roger Miller's ""King of the Road"" (playing on his truck's radio) to a picture of tearful, utter devastation minutes later, following his face-to-face meeting with Ennis, in an ending segment, back in his truck, that is beautifully underscored by Emmylou Harris's haunting ""A Love That Will Never Grow Old."" Throughout the film, Gyllenhaal's facial expressions alone  eyebrows that convey thoughts without a spoken word, an embarrassed glance at Ennis while fighting a belligerent horse, a sad, distant longing in his eyes during a flashback sequence of happier times  are the stuff of movie magic.Swirling around these two actors is a quintet of striking female performances  from Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway, Linda Cardellini, Anna Faris, and Kate Mara. All have taken their characters and made them their own. Williams, as Alma, makes a flawless transition from a lovingly devoted wife to that of a grimly determined spouse desperately trying to hold on to something that has shockingly evaporated before her disbelieving eyes. As Alma Jr., Kate Mara is, particularly in the last scenes with her father (Ledger), absolutely radiant.A sixth standout actress in this film deserves a special mention of her own. Roberta Maxwell, portraying Jack's mother, takes command of the screen in her brief, emotionally charged scenes and delivers a performance you will never forget.I can't add any additional kudos to the cast and crew that haven't already been deservedly doled out elsewhere in countless reviews posted here by my fellow contributors. Everything clicks  Ang Lee's sweeping direction, Gustavo Santaolalla's sauntering musical score, a masterful screenplay by Diana Ossana and Larry McMurtry, and Annie Proulx's spellbinding short story, written almost a decade ago, that initially started any and all of us on our long journey to Brokeback Mountain.The DVD of this film has sat in my DVD player for almost two weeks now, readily accessible  as if I've foolishly, inexplicably convinced myself that, if removed, these marvelous characters and their heartbreaking story will be lost to me forever. How irrational and illogical is that? I have no explanation.See this film.",Brokeback Mountain
820,Darrell-270,This movie left me wanting more...,10,24 December 2005,"The story was incredible. This is not something I could have ever imagined in my wildest dreams. The acting was astounding. The emotions were so vivid and so well put together. It has been many years since a movie touched me the way this one did. On my drive to the theater my thoughts were that this was going to be another gay movie that is riddled with homosexual stereotypes. Those thoughts were very wrong. It was nothing like that at all. I could not help but feel a sense of love and compassion towards all of the characters. The movie focuses largely on love and how we sometimes have someone who loves us dearly, and wish we could have changed our reaction towards the love. We sometimes even hurt the ones we love the most. How sad for all parties involved. Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger won my heart - completely. This movie must win awards. A definite 10.",Brokeback Mountain
821,joinedhip,Gay People Are Seldom This Boring,3,4 March 2006,"This movie was like watching ice melt. On a thirty-three degree day. ""Far From Heaven"" covered a lot of the same territory in a much more interesting fashion. Jake G lost his accent when he gained his mustache and never really found a character. Heath was amazing but had nothing around him to stick it to (if you'll excuse the expression). This was a long, boring movie with about twenty minutes of plot stretched out to over two hours. I'm glad this film has resonated with the mainstream to this extent, but...it's not very good. I know the theme is supposed to be repression and nothing really is supposed to happen, but nothing could happen in a lot shorter time. This made the Hulk look good and...the Hulk was bad. Maybe if the Hulk were a gay cowboy....",Brokeback Mountain

But, I was slightly disappointed---because I found it somewhat slow and overlong.As a film, it lacks the emotional punch I expected.Heath Ledger and Jake G. were superb though, and all the actors excelled. Heath Ledgershould win this years Oscar. Ang Lee's direction was very good--though not as polished as his work on ""Sense and Sensibility"" and ""CrouchingDragon""---he at times, seems to e wanting this film to be the gay ""Last Picture Show""---I am surprised he didn't shoot it in black and white. I will say this though, This is a movie that stays with you--and is probably a movie that will improve with repeated viewings (after the idea of what is expected is moot--- and especially because of the actors) As far as the ""controversy"" over it being a ""Gay"" love story---that is for the media to hype and ponder, I found it are refreshing and human Love story. I totally recommend it!",Brokeback Mountain
823,healinghoe,The Magic of Brokeback Mountain,10,2 May 2006,"It is very rare that a film comes into the cinema and touches the hearts of all who watch it. Brokeback Mountain is probably the only film that has been able to achieve this. The film is a typical love story, but with the twist. It is so much more than the ""gay cowboy flick"" it was hyped up to be.The story is a fantastic tribute to the trials of love over time. Both Jake and Heath play the roles perfectly. They were so convincing. And they have changed the views of so many people on homosexuality. If anything, this only adds to the triumph of Brokeback Mountain. But the main triumph is the tragedy and the power of this unique film.Having read the story, I was worried that the film may turn out to be a flop. How wrong I was. The film hit me like a ton of bricks. Even now I can't think of the tragic end of the film without tears coming to my eyes. It made nearly everyone in the cinema cry. You just care so much about the characters and the tragedy just makes it all seem so real.To finish, I think that Brokeback Mountain is the best love story ever written. It is a triumph and a landmark film. The tender story, sweeping romance and dramatic scenery, as well as the tragic finale all add to the success of this cinematic masterpiece that has to be seen to be believed.",Brokeback Mountain
824,marian-1,Breakthrough event in cinematography,10,12 February 2006,"The book, The Joy of Sex, defined bisexuality as the normal human condition. It said that what is abnormal about people who are homosexual (a term, BTW that ought to be applied to either gender) is not that they are attracted to people of their own gender, but that they have an aversion to the other gender. Everything makes more sense if we look at human sexuality as a spectrum from the people who are only attracted to their own gender, ranging through the (majority) middle ground of people who may have a preference one way or the other but could go either way, depending on a number of factors, through the people on the other end of the spectrum, who are only attracted to the other gender than the one they are. Looking at it like this, we do not have to get into big debates on ""whether someone is really gay or not"". Most human beings are in the middle somewhere. Understanding and tolerance of that fact will go a long, long way toward making this world a more reasonable and happy place to live.In spite of the fact that the editing is quite jerky and choppy in places and could have been greatly improved upon, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The two main actors and the two main supporting actresses all did outstanding jobs of subtly portraying profound emotion. The film has the aesthetics (and I am not talking about the scenery), depth of story, character and the layers of meaning that make true art.",Brokeback Mountain

I am the one laughing now, because they haven't experienced the cinematic masterpiece that is Brokeback Mountain.I could write essays about this film, but i'd probably start crying. It was heartbreaking and actually so beautiful.The acting, the cinematography, the dialogue. Incredible, perfect.I love Jake Gyllenhaal's acting and i loved Heath Ledger's acting. Ennis and Jack were such well thought out and well acted characters. Truly a film that i will recommend to everyone and it will stay my favourite film forever.",Brokeback Mountain
826,akunau,Boring cinema marketed as a classic,2,30 June 2006,"I really wanted to like this film. Brokeback Mountain is a film congratulating itself on its greatness without really achieving it on even a small scale.Romantic love between two people is an interesting subject for a film, if intelligently pursued with an interesting plot. However, besides the stunning backdrop of the mountains and lush cinematography, what I experienced in Brokeback Mtn was melodrama, mis-casting (both Michelle Williams and Anne Hathway look like and act like they are 12) bad hair-do's, and a very unflattering portrait of gay men. The use of light (the violent ""love scene"" that was so dark you couldn't see anything) the twilight zone type grey hues of Jack's parents house (which of course his parents had to be miserable, right?) the complete indifference of both men to their wives and children except for Ennis' relationship with his eldest daughter...the list goes on. Most of the time, I was bored out of my mind. And the scene with Jack and Lureen going to dinner and her friend's husband hits on him...I mean, come on!! I think the time has come for real gay romances, male or female. To me, though, BM just isn't that movie. Maybe for some, but I think this movie's success is based more on what society thinks it is ready for in terms of gay cinema, than on its actual merits. There are better gay (or just romantic films in general, forget the labels) films being made that aren't getting the publicity.",Brokeback Mountain
827,dottydolly,For Straight Women & Gay Men,10,2 December 2006,"I'm a 40 something wife & Mum. I love movies and I really wanted to see this one, I waited until it was shown on one of the movie channels. It was well worth the wait! I do believe, however, that this movie, as beautifully done as it is, is best for straight women and gay men. There was so much love and tenderness in it, so much truth and honesty that would appeal to both these. I cannot imagine there being anything there to see for gay women, and my husband has said that he does not want to see it, especially after I told him about it. The cinematography is stunning, the acting the finest. I had only seen Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead before, I thought he was very good in that too. Heath Ledger has a huge scope of acting skills, the first movie I saw him in was Monster's Ball, and I thought him brilliant then. I can't wait to see more movies with both these guys! Thanks Ang Lee! Blimmin' great!!!!! Lesley",Brokeback Mountain
828,davisprof,"Sorry gang. We all want to like this movie, but it really stinks.",4,26 March 2006,"Evidently the producers thought that the shocking idea of homosexuality on the range was itself so powerful that it didn't need any of the other trappings of narrative film-making -- plot, character development, motivation. The time scheme is so poorly delineated -- and the age makeup for the two hunkettes so timid -- that the only way to tell what's going on is by figuring out how old their kids are. The two actors try their best, with Ledger putting in the funniest mumble performance this side of Benecio del Toro. But pretty much the rest is cliché, especially Michelle Williams' noble anger a la Jennifer Connelly. How did Ang Lee, so deft and comic in WEDDING BANQUET, become pompous so quickly? In Frank Oz's messy but still insightful IN & OUT, Matt Dillon plays a good-hearted narcissist who wins an Oscar for playing a gay solider. The film clips that we see at the film's Oscar Awards (brilliantly introduced by an uproariously fatuous Glenn Close) are suitably self-congratulatory (and hilarious). Give Brokeback Mountain a few years, and Larry McMurtry's script will seem as unintentionally idiotic as Paul Rudnick's was intentionally so.",Brokeback Mountain

830,melissa-feagin,Moving,9,28 January 2007,"Alright let's get the negative out of the way.. it was very slow-moving.And now, the positive... with an achingly poignant plot and convincing characters, I teared up several times during the film. Not necessarily about being gay, the film portrayed a forbidden love... so some critics say Romeo and Juliet is great and this is bad? Hmm...as far as all those who ranted on about the ""cheating""... I guess I didn't see it that way because honestly, they were cheating on themselves to be with their wives. The raw emotion seen in scene after scene was heart-wrenching, and one of the final scenes where Heath Ledger finds the shirt of his dead lover is an absolute tear-jerker. I heard every negative thing there was to hear about this film, mostly because of the homosexual aspect of it. But after seeing it myself, I found the acting superb, the directing top-notch, and I agree that one almost feels numb after the emotional plunge of the film. Kudos to the actors and director.",Brokeback Mountain
831,bass1bone,Love?,8,2 June 2006,"There are many who will disagree with my thesis straightaway, so I will begin with it: Brokeback Mountain is not a movie about a love affair between two men, but a movie about addiction.Do not dismiss that statement easily; I write as an addict. One of the marks of addiction is the willingness to pursue an activity or substance irregardless of the costs to one's family, job and/or financial situation. Homosexuality in America has, at least until recently, been likely to be hurtful to all of those aspects of life, and I would certainly not say that homosexuality in general is addictive or based on an addiction. But this film offers much more concrete details that point to the particular relationship portrayed being based upon addiction--besides the fact that the men pursue their relationship despite the fact that they both have wives and children.1) These words from Jack: ""You count the d*** few times we have been together in nearly twenty years and you measure the short f***ing leash you keep me on - and then you ask me about Mexico and tell me you'll kill me for needing somethin' I don't hardly never get. You have no idea how bad it gets! I'm not you... I can't make it on a coupla high-altitude f***s once or twice a year! You are too much for me Ennis, you sonofa*****son b****! I wish I knew how to quit you."" Come on, do we really think that people satisfy a (legitimate) need for love by enlisting the services of a prostitute? Consider the case of a man whose wife has just given birth; would we really say that for him to visit a prostitute during the ""no sex"" period ""satisfies"" a ""need"" that his wife cannot meet? Are we to believe that sex equals love?2) The loss of control and the single-minded focus on the addictive behavior. Ennis speaks about the lack of control: ""Bottom line is...we're around each other an'...this thing, it grabs hold of us again...at the wrong place...at the wrong time...and we're dead."" You also see it when the two get together for the first time after 4 years: they act as though they're going to lay each other right there on the stairs. And both men do and say things that give away their single-minded attention to this one thing: Ennis is almost completely unresponsive to his family as he returns from the motel to prepare for their first ""fishing trip"", for instance.3) Selfishness. As I said before, the men pursue their relationships despite having wives and children. But each man also allows and willingly provides for the other man to be unfaithful to his wife; Ennis the divorcée is no less wrong because the person he is ""fishing"" with is married.Having said all that, I really liked the movie. It challenged me, made me uncomfortable; it haunts me now. But it also haunts me that this is called a ""love story.""",Brokeback Mountain
832,Garfieldlam,"""Brokeback Mountain"": Sinking in Distress",10,27 January 2006,"There are movies that you can not (or you are unwilling to) watch for the second time, not because they are bad, but because of some insurmountable psychological block- Such as ""Saving Private Ryan"": the expression of war is too real and too brutal; ""Naturally Born Killer"": desire to kill in your subconscious can be wakened; ""Ring"": too dark and scary; And finally the latest ""Brokeback Mountain"": too distressful. A romance began in the eyes of Brokeback Mountain with youth flickering amongst the running clouds and howling water, then cooled down by the trivialness of ordinary life, but ignited again by a ""long over due"" postcard. The Passion drowsed for years became more and more unquitabble, but eventually ended up with a sad pause along the zigzags in Brokeback Mountain. It has been difficult enough to understand why almost all of the public media had described the emotion between Jack and Ennis as ""A romance beyond genders"". Could it be an excuse for some of heterosexuals? After all, to accept ""beyond genders"" is much easier than to admit touched by the emotion between Jack and Ennis. To me, this is just the romance between too men, pure, fiery and real. Incommunicable and undeliverable Ennis was awakened with true feelings deeply in heart by the frankness and presumptuousness of Jack. Their couple-of days' annual reunion has never satisfied their desire, neither physically nor mentally. However, under that social circumstance, this ""indecent"" romance had no future regardless of human will. Was that really true? How many times had Jack directly or indirectly indicated a proposal to live together in a place where they were unknown, but turned down by Ennis? Ennis always had this or that reason: public pressure, the difficulties to sustain basic living, the responsibility of children's alimony, and so on. There is a spot deeply in his heart that can not be touched by Jack. Maybe the shadow branded in his heart by the witness of a gay couple's horrible death in his childhood had somewhat suggested Ennis' dependence on realistic world and the depression from the incapability of the expression of his true feeling, even in front of his lover. In the second half of the movie, there is a painful exposition of feelings: Facing Brokeback Mountain, Jack and Ennis poured out their suffering from the missing lasting for years, the desire deeply in hearts and the resentment from the misunderstanding of the other side about the realistic dilemma. I don't want to distinguish these two men with realism or romanticism. However, Being bold and straightforward, Jack has always had longings about their future, even blueprinted a perfect hermit life in Brokeback Mountain, which eventually was buried by an accident, or in another saying, buried by the elution of self ego and the desperation and compromise to the real world from Ennis. It was not only until Jack was dead, Ennis found the little secret hidden in the closet of his room in his parents' house that made him realize how deep and how real Jack'd been loving him and his love to Jack. In the last scenes of the movie, After witnessed his daughter driving away who was gonna marry her true love, Ennis opened his closet and staring the picture of Brokeback mountain with tears full in his eyes and murmuring ""I swear…"". But with someone's passed-away, was it really need to be the reunion in heaven that the romance lasting for more than 20 year can be continued? However, let's consider this in another way, in a puritanical country, even to the 21st century, homosexuals failed to achieve their righteous rights , what can we expected from Ennis from 20 or 30 years ago? Therefore, the memory of ""Brokeback Mountain"" will be kept in my mind forever. But I won't watch it again. This feeling sinking in distress is really uncomfortable. Maybe this is another kind of elution, right?",Brokeback Mountain

And it had nothing to do with the fact that they were two males, I've felt lack of chemistry/caring in male/female roles sometimes as well. I just didn't find it believable.I really wanted Heath Ledger to spit out the marbles he must have been carrying around in his mouth the whole time, I don't know who came up with that 'accent' for him, but it was annoying and made it hard to understand him.The cinematography was great.

I saw a DVD screener with a friend who's a movie critic, and afterwards I watched most of it again. I'm surprised it didn't win best picture, but then again I haven't seen Crash.The screenplay, cinematography, directing, acting, everything was there. One scene made me a bit uncomfortable, but I thought everything was done very tastefully.What set this apart from other movies with gay characters is that it really didn't have anything to do with being gay per se. Make one of the men a woman and you would hardly need to change a thing about the movie.

Ang Lee's direction is faultless as are all the performances, including all supporting roles, and particularly the depiction towards the end of the film of Jack Twist's knowing, loving mother.Heath Ledger's Ennis collapses in seismic passion because of his inability to absorb the depth and beauty of Jack Twist's love for him - and while the review I read of Heath Ledger's portrayal deservedly hailed Ledger, for me it was Jake Gyllenhall's performance as Jack Twist that propelled the movie.I recommend viewers to read Stephen Holden's review in The New York Times, available on line.

837,irfan_meric,"Stunning shoots, stunning acts, shocking reality",9,17 July 2015,"Ang Lee, apparently saw some beautiful camera shoots and used them to make the photography of the film beautiful and effective. If we consider the part of nature on the storyline (I mean the effect of Brokeback Mountain on Ennis and Jack), we can see that it was a very well thought idea. The nature of the mountain refers to the nature of humans.Homosexuality isn't the only thing about this movie, actually. Ang Lee used It as tool to tell a different story. A story of a person's suppressions in his emotional world. Ennis' childhood memories, his traumas lead him to a person who is terrified of society, what It can do. That's why Ennis runs from a life where Jack and him could live. He tries to suppress his feelings about Jack by getting married and having children. And so does Jack. They both try to suppress their homosexuality but they fail. They can resist their nature. The nature that Brokeback Mountain unveiled.Society's poison of making people similar and not allowing differences leads Ennis and Jack to a life that they have to hide, suffer from not being themselves. This film is a criticism of society. Ang Lee uses reality so effective that you find yourself shocked and upset by how things happened in Ennis and Jack's lives over the years. Ang Lee used slow scenes and preferred less talking between characters so face impressions, gestures and emotions can talk. And he succeeded. This is a minimal film, in that context. Ang Lee's succinct wording crushes audience's chests with painful truths (the truths that society thinks correct) and how we are vulnerable against the people we live together.At the end of the film; even though Jack's family embraces Jack's nature (not entirely), they refuse to scatter his ashes in Brokeback Mountain. These lines are a the perfect summary of the main idea in the movie. Even the society sees and allows homosexuality (or any other kinds of differences), they will never truly accept people's true natures.The film slapped the reality that sadly we will never can be ourselves in any society because our value judgments will always effect each other. We will always suppress somethings and It will kill, eventually, us inside. We may see ourselves ""living"" on the outside; but we will be dead inside. We will regret for the things that we couldn't live, when we look back on our lives. Just like Ennis did. So, whatever we do; we have do It freely so that we won't regret not doing It. We only live once.As an asexual person, I'm so happy that I'm living without labels. I was bullied, insulted, considered odd, suppressed...at the end, I was still myself. And If I get killed because of just being different, I will die being myself. Society can't make me somebody I'm not. I'm not rewarded with this life to live, due to other people's thoughts and requestsI hope we all live a life where we can live as ourselves. Like the way it should be.",Brokeback Mountain
838,forrestunknown,A story based around truths,10,26 December 2005,"I have seen the movie twice now, a highly unusual action for me. It was just as powerful as it was the first time and left with something, a certain loss at the end of each screening.Having previously read the short story, and hearing all the rumors and buff about the movie beforehand I wasn't sure what to expect. The story itself moves so much and relies on details not always easy to translate into a visual media. It was far more.There are many things that can be questioned; small details or changes to the original script, things left unsaid or unanswered, and differences in interpretation. And though even at the end, there are some things that may trouble you, the story, the telling is amazingly done to transcend past these petty small things. Because in the movie, much like in life, there are often things that are just not known and yet things still continue to progress.I took a lot from this movie, even more so after talking to a former ranch person who spoke the truth of it, even continuing to this day. There is a sumptuous attention to the backdrops and color uses, adding to the mood and atmosphere. The acting is superb, especially in small things like gestures or body movements. The cast as a whole is strong, but though many say Heath owned the movie in his brilliant stoicism, Jake was his equal match in unbridled hope.",Brokeback Mountain
839,ecpato,Good but not the film I was told about. -spoiler-,7,24 February 2006,"This is the second time in recent memory I have felt this way about media, the first being The DaVinci Code (which although I think is over-hyped, I still think its a great book, perhaps slightly more worthy than this film, but I digress). Either way, the situation is similar, I feel a good piece of work is having its reputation over embellished by the controversial nature of its subject matter. The view that this movie is supposedly redefining what a ""Love Story"" can be is, first of all, not something I agree with. I don't think it redefined anything about love, the feelings and the story are fairly old, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I had seen this movie before in the way of side plots or reorganizations or fractions of other films.It seemed almost as though the point that they were in a sexual relationship was tagged on. Maybe because of how quickly it happened or how it is then just stretched and stretched through out the rest of the slow moving film. It almost like the movie is two movies which were mismatched. The story just seemed so stretched (which I suppose makes sense since the film is based on a short story).Acting was, well, acting like cowboys, who always kind of seem sexually repressed. This wasn't exactly a major stretch of the imagination.My biggest criticism is by far how slow and monotonous this movie is. It seems like everything goes on for to long. and when something finally does happen it seems forced and sudden, like when -spoiler- Jack dies -end spoiler-.",Brokeback Mountain
840,nandy-rinki,All we got is the Brokeback Mountain...,10,3 June 2011,"I couldn't agree more with those who have rated this movie excellent. Most times after watching a movie I say to myself ""it's only a movie"" but this one, BBM makes it's way to my most favorite list which is now a huge part of my life. From the slow, smooth beginning till the emotional, weepy end both escorted by brilliant background score I loved it ...I lived it. I felt I was in there and it's all happening in front of me and not in some DVD. I am a woman and I wish I could just hug jack twist once and kiss Ennis in the last scene, there's so much honesty, love, loss, emotion, loneliness and freedom in that scene, With the BBM postcard and their shirts together...oh..I cried and I cried and couldn't stop myself from thinking about it. All the characters are brilliant, background score is touchy and emotional and it is picturesque too with lonely streets and beautiful landscapes'. Although I sometimes wonder would Ennis have realized his object of affection had Jack not initiated it? And would Jack have taken a trip to Mexico had Ennis rejected him in the mountain? Both men lived a normal family life otherwise, and Ennis didn't seem to bother much at first so would he have taken a step forward and contacted Jack in case the latter never did? In this case it is Jack who loves Ennis dearly but doesn't mind a trip to Mexico once in a while. Ennis on the other hand, loves him back but is not free from family and social obligations hence, he loves within his boundaries. Both lead characters are common people, people no one notices. They are like anyone, you and me and this is what makes this movie you don't watch but live in with the characters becoming your friends. I had mine in Jack and Ennis. It is lovely, mature, real, artsy, a commonplace with common people. This one may as well have been a silent movie given it's Texan / Wyoming jokes and accent which was too difficult to understand at times so, I chose not to pay attention to their words rather watch their eyes and listen through my eyes.

841,ludwigvan_beethoven,Masterpiece but with some imperfections,9,20 January 2006,"While the heterosexual actors in Brokeback Mountain play gay characters---their portrayal of gay people is not entirely convincing. For that reason two gay men who can project a heterosexual persona should have done the part of Jack Twist and Innis particularly in the sex scenes which instead of being done like two people in love come across more like a prison rape scene than consensual sex. The heterosexual sex scenes come across more like the characters are enjoying heterosexual sex a little too much--at least more than gay characters would enjoy being queer queer. It is only later that these actors achieve some similance of what their gay characters would have been like by being tender and gentle with each other. Most times; one does not know for sure if the characters are beating each other up or not with all the rough treatment these actors give each other.I had heard before seeing this movie that it was filled with one sex scene after another,nudity, expletives in just about every sentence ad nauseum. I am glad to report that this is not true. The nudity is very tastefully done with no frontal scenes.The story line has a great deal of reality to it. IT is however a very sad and tragic story because it deals with heterosexuality and traditions violating the rights of gay people and forcing them to deny their gayness. If you are expecting the see the stereotype of gay men here you will have to look elsewhere. These guys play the stereotype super macho heterosexual guy to the hilt and are proud to be gay men not an imitation of a fake woman. If there is a real life day to day lesson in this movie it is that gay people should be allowed to marry and raise their own families as same sex couples just as heterosexual couples do. One has to be a very hard hearted person not to have some tears in their eyes when coming out of this movie. Innis's denial of his homosexuality is so profound that when he finally recognizes that he is gay; it is too late ---he learns that Jack is dead and they can not be a couple as Jack had wished all these years. Innis holds own to Jack's clothing and a picture of Brokeback Mountain in his closet which is all he has left of a relationship that could have been.Highly recommended; the landscape is simply gorgeous and the screen writers keep things real except for the sex scenes but then the author says that she had to imagine what sex would be like between men and she might have not known that same sex experience is almost the same as heterosexual sex. There are some continuity problems and while I have not seen the parts that fell on the editing floor--I suspect that just too much was cut from the film which is why parts of it come across on the brutal side as the scenes leading up to various scenes have been cut out.This is a do not miss movie.",Brokeback Mountain
842,bernardobrown,Forbidden Love...How many ways can you tell it.,6,22 January 2006,"First of all the acting in this is very good. Especially Heath Ledger. He did a fantastic job.However the storyline is a bit trite. It is after all, a story about two people making a connection and then facing a situation where they cannot keep it going...i.e. ""Forbidden Love."" It's been told numerous times before and in my opinion the story is here does not present it any new or novel way. I think ""Lost in Translation"" was a more clever way of showing the same thing. The metaphor is not that complex and I think it is more a function of the writing and overall story rather than anything else.",Brokeback Mountain
843,ron101346,Not what you'd expect,9,3 January 2006,"BBM was quite a bit different from what I expected. I thought it was going to be a ""gay cowboy flick"", as the late-night comedians were saying, but it turned out to be a very deep drama. The two cowboys (actually sheepboys; they met while herding 1000 head of sheep across Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming) were placed in the year 1963, but it almost seemed like 1863, since there was little difference in how they felt about themselves and about homosexuality from what someone in some past century probably felt. It was all very tightly wound and almost as frustrating and sad to watch as it was for the characters. While critics have been throwing awards at all the cast, the whole picture really rested on Ennis' character (Heath Ledger) who was AMAZING. His intensity for showing love--in ways that were absolutely forbidden for his time and culture--is a real accomplishment and a wonder to watch. (And watching two hot actors kiss and sleep together without apology or homosexual panic who are actually straight in real life is also a treat!) If he doesn't get the Oscar, then there is still 1 ounce of homophobia left in the Academy.Ron101346 Philly",Brokeback Mountain
844,mmeltzer-1,"lust, passion and love in the expression of the human spirit",8,16 January 2006,"""Brokeback Mountain"" explodes with magnificent scenery, and reminds viewers in the process that there is a bigger picture. This is not a movie about homosexuals. It is a movie about three faces of human attraction; passion, lust and love, and how the unwinding of a person's life, the unmet needs of growing up and settling down compel us to dream, even sleepwalk, or how the unwanted visions of human cruelty and deprived circumstance compel us to shrink or strike out. No. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is not a gay movie. And if you view it that way it's richly woven fabric of human circumstance loses the delicacy of understanding required to get what Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist mean when they each declare to the other they are not queer. Nor are they, and that's a lot to think about!To call ""Brokeback Mountain"" love with a Twist is something you might get at the very end, in the final reveal when the spirit of Jack Twist recalls him as a man with an every childs' dream he could never give up. If you were or can imagine the child of divorcing parents, both of whom you loved, you begin to get it. But forget it! This is not a divorce movie, either. It's a movie from an ever emerging genre that explores psychodynamics as a matter of course or accident, though I can't speak for Ang's exact intentions. In the end, the feelings that underlie the emotions become as palpable as the aroma of herb spiced slow cooking.As much as I might like, I cannot follow a director's career, and so cannot discuss, nor would I research in order to discuss director Ang Lee's body of work. No doubt I've seen and immensely enjoyed much of it. I cannot speak to the acting either, other than to say that they get the job done well. Oscars? Why not? There's plenty of money shots, and Ang must be pleased, but in putting this vision together, I imagine the through lines are a patchwork quilt of unrelated motivations. 'Play this scene as if you're starving men given a can of sweetened baked beans with bacon and a hack saw to open it. You each get one or the other. You can trade them, but you can't have both to yourself, and you both get to eat.' I have no idea how to rate this film on a scale of 1-10. For all its warmth, it is not sensual. It's a tedious film for me, not very entertaining, though beautifully shot, immensely informative about the human condition, and narratively layered like hand crafted mud plaster on an adobe wall, formed from the ground up and worked to uneven perfection. So, I'll say an 8 or better and not to be missed if you want to identify with the overall human condition in an unexpected way as an outsider looking in.In 1931, Jung wrote on Western civilized man's toying with eastern philosophies of spirituality and enlightenment. ""It is not a question of our imitating, or worse still, becoming missionaries for what is organically foreign, but rather a question of building up our own Western culture, which sickens with a thousand ills."" In 1974 I was instructing physical education to middle school kids. Two adolescent boys, brothers, my students were in the front seat of a pickup parked on the side of the road. The oldest was not old enough to have a license, but we didn't care. I was with the principal and another professional educator as we approached in our vehicle and caught them in our lights. We decided we'd razz them just a little because we knew 'em well enough and didn't think anything was going on that required intervention. For all we thought they were seeing whose thingy was bigger. Maybe we were. It's the metaphorical ego thing, right. So one of us shouted, ""What are you doing out on a school night,"" and the others of us shouted, ""Yeah what are you doing,"" knowing full well it was summer, but we were lubricated anyway. The younger brother rolled down his window and said delightfully, ""Never you mind. We're doing our own business,"" and we older brothers didn't mind. We were all doing our own business. It was gratifying to know they were finding their own way with malice toward none and hearts light as laughter. When life works out, this is what sticks to the ribs.If Ang Lee tells nothing else he tells us that we're all finding our own way. Ennis and Jack just desperately loved to fish is all.",Brokeback Mountain
845,IMDaBabe,"Powerful and moving film, shows love is universal",10,7 January 2006,"This was the first time I ever stood in line for a movie in the U.S. with about 50 people ahead of me, all for Brokeback Mountain. Most of them were 40+ couples, mostly heterosexual. Once I saw the movie I was rather glad that people turned out in such numbers to watch the movie, it made me feel that people do understand the universal nature of love - it doesn't care for gender, age, religion or race.Ang Lee has created a powerful movie that delves deep into the story of two men who fall in love, what makes it memorable is that it is 1963 and these men are 2 cowboys in Wyoming where homosexuality is not only taboo, but most people have no name for it. Reading some reviews it seemed strange to me that some critics have classified Jack and Ennis as 'bisexual' simply because they had sex with their wives. It seemed to me that they were so weighted down by their circumstances and the societal expectations that they did whatever it took to ""fit in"" - especially Ennis, but could not escape their feelings for each other. The love and passion between the two men in the beautiful setting of mountains and lakes is lyrical and poetic, and will make anyone who has ever loved someone identify with them. I have never understood why gay love, or any other love is taboo. If two people love each other they should be able to live with each other, and this movie perhaps will make some more people think so.",Brokeback Mountain

Now, I want to comment on the user votes registered so far. LOOK AT THE CHART ON THE VOTES, and notice that from 10 on down, the numbers get lower and lower, until you reach the ""1"" rating, where the number goes way up. Do any of you doubt that the users giving this movie a ""1"" rating have a political agenda? My guess is that most of them have not even seen the movie (or how could they rate it a ""1""?!?!). So, to all you homophobes who are trying to screw up the rating for this movie, please stick to rating movies according to their merit and not your bigoted point of view.

I HATE those dreadful cineplex suburb movie gathering places where I saw it. I was initially disengaged with the movie and hoped that I could see it on a small screen in an ""art house"" setting. Canal Place, our local Landmark theater re-opened last weekend after having been closed for almost six months because of Hurricane Katrina's rampage. I went to Canal Place two days ago to see the movie again. I was just mildly less disengaged than I was the first time.I'm not sure that ""main stream"" America is going to be more tolerate of homosexuals because of this movie. I was disappointed that the actors didn't ""age"" very well over twenty years. I think that the stand out performance was that of Roberta Maxwell who plays Mrs. Twist. Now that performance deserved a best supporting actress nod.This movie doesn't displace my affection and love for some other ""queer"" themed movies such as ""Maurice,"" last year's under rated and very moving ""A Home at the End of the World,"" ""Gods and Monsters,"" and ""Parting Glances"" to name a few.Still, I admire the forces behind the scenes which made it possible to see this tragic story of two bisexual men whose lives are a lie to the loved ones around them.",Brokeback Mountain

I have spent many beautiful moments in Wyoming with my partner of 38 years and had sex there. He initiated it, which was out of his normal libido. Unfortunitely, he had his prostate gland removed due to cancer. WE have not lived together for several years for various reasons but I still love him and will always. We used to have sex occasionally, but after the surgery very little as it was one sided. I purchased BBM on DVD and gave it to him. I was hoping that we could view it together and at least cuddle.

I also thought that the reactions to it being about two men being gay were outrageous. Now having seeing it I can see why some people would be uncomfortable with it. I thought the story was incredible, the acting was intense and very well done, but the scenes involving Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were just too much for me. The nudity just didn't seem appropriately done or necessary and the fact that they showed gay love scenes and that these men met up again and again over the years for the purpose of having sex took away from what I thought the story was. I enjoyed the movie but it wasn't what I expected and there are things that I could have lived without seeing. If you really know what to expect from this movie then by all means go see it if you are interested.

It one Oscars and Baftas, so my thinking was that it would be truly excellent. How very disappointed I was. It truly is a most average and mundane film. None of the characters could I get very much sympathy, so I was not very interested in what did happen to them. But, that's OK because nothing really did happen to them. Jake Gyllenhall was good but has done better. Heath Ledger was terrible- at times it is virtually impossible to understand what he is saying, as he mumbles just about every sentence he has to speak. The really disappointing thing is that it fails completely to address any of the issues these men have about being gay> it makes no statement, it has no opinion. All you really get is the Wyoming and Texas scenery, which looks about as damp and cold as the film.",Brokeback Mountain

I was very glad to see it win the GG for best picture and director and hope that it makes a good showing for the Oscars.

All preconceptions of the movie I had before I went into the theatre were gone within the first five minutes.This isn't just a ""gay western"" as it's been so stereotypically categorized. It's a love story. Not only that, but it's a beautiful, heart wrenching love story. I've never been a fan of movies set out in the Midwest. Maybe that's just me. But this movie is the first I've seen that's brought that barren landscape across in a way that's not only harsh, but almost artistic.Heath Ledger undoubtedly steals the film in a way that's hard to put your finger on. His subtle, quiet, and intense performance as Ennis may never exactly bring tears to your eyes but it breaks your heart into a thousand pieces throughout the course of the movie. Jake Gyllenhal is no less moving in his role as Jack Twist, and yet somehow harder to sympathize with. As Ennis' wife, Michelle Williams makes it increasingly difficult to root for the love between Jack and Ennis. You feel her pain and it's her side of the story as much as the men's that makes it so hard. I would be surprised if all three of these actors didn't gain Oscar nominations.I'm not sure if it's a movie I would watch again. It was hard enough the first time, and I mean that in the best way possible. But if you haven't seen it yet, I would highly suggest it.

854,mario-dalimonte,Beautiful In So Many Ways,10,20 December 2005,"I had heard a lot about this movie, so my expectations were high. What a pleasure it was to have these expectations surpassed. This is Ang Lee's best film to date. In spite of what the headlines and the talk show hosts' lame jokes say, Brokeback Mountain is not a movie about gay cowboys. This is a movie about lost opportunity. It is about love, about family, about the choices we make in life. It is about the choices each of us makes, and the way we must live with them. It is a universal story. Its universality may the be very thing that undermines its potential to be a 'commercial' success, because it may frighten people who can' see beyond the gay love story. The acting is superb. After seeing CAPOTE, I thought Phillip Seymour Hoffman would have no competition for any of the Best Actor awards. Now I'm not sure. Both Heath Leger and Jake Gyllenhall deliver performances that deserve to be honoured (and not just because they are two straight men who are willing to play gay). The actress who plays Alma is extraordinary. What a delight to see Roberta Maxwell (one of Canada's best actresses) in the role of Jack's mother.I was riveted to the screen during the entire running time of this intelligent, insightful, beautiful, beautiful film.",Brokeback Mountain

Who could have dreamed that a movie about a couple of ""gay cowboys"" would be so beautifully done and gain such wide and avid acclaim. The director, Ang Lee, must be given much of the credit, as well as the two fine actors you've probably read so much about. And while this story is generally a first for the silver screen, there seems to be no agenda here. It's a tragic story, beautifully told and, since the time period is the early sixties to eighties, it could be linked with another ""gay themed"" film, The Boys in the Band, which was generally denounced by the gay community for portraying gays as a sad group of outcasts. No parties here. No romps in the sands of the Hamptons. Don't go looking for gay porno. There's little actual sex in the film.

857,WhiteManFromTown86,Numbing is the right word...,10,27 April 2006,"I don't know what else to say about ""Brokeback Mountain"" except that it was a beautifully made and stunning epic of a film. This is one of those films that actually burns itself into your mind leaving you with a feeling of emptiness. Never have I seen a film like this...never. It was totally original and emotionally deep. Jack and Ennis whom first meet herding sheep on Brokeback Mountain fall in love with each other and end up having to deal with the emotional angst that results from it. The film is rich in life and emotion...never have I seen such passion and anger all rolled up into a 2 hour film like this. The acting is magnificent by all involved. And I must say that Heath Ledger was astounding as the closeted and emotionally tortured Ennis Del Mar. He totally owned the screen when he was on...the passion he showed for this part proves that he will go places and his career has only just begun. Jake Gyllenhaal was of course great as usual...I always knew he would go places ever since ""Donnie Darko"". I felt so terrible for his character of Jack Twist because he was the one who was actually willing to change his life's way to be with Ennis. But they could not be together and that was the killer. All they could get was ""fishing trips"" 3 times a year. Heath and Jake whom I respect for being so brave in displaying their roles have permanently earned a place of respect in my mind's eyes. Michelle Williams was astounding as Alma...I knew she would go places since ""Dawson's Creek"". Well she surpasses it to the point of my jaw dropping to the floor. The scene in which she first sees Jack and Ennis kissing was perfectly acted. That shock on her face was pure cinematic genius. She was completely awesome and dominated the screen when she was on. Keep up the good work Michelle...you deserve the respect as well. Hell, even Anne Hathaway was good in her small little role. She reminded me so much of my aunts when I was a child growing up in Texas. The hair, make-up, etc. The entire cast was great and I couldn't imagine any one else taking the parts. Ang Lee's directing was epic. The cinematography was breathtaking and added to the richness of the film's message. The screenplay was top notch and really hit me. When the film was over I was completely numbed by it. It's so sad to actually think homosexuals were treated this way...even now a days its still pretty damn bad. Ennis's haunting memory of the guy who was killed when he was a child perfectly summed up why Ennis was the way he was. The film was perfect...and I never give films a perfect score. But I will give it to this one because of its courage and breathtaking scenes of emotion and passion. Perhaps this is the film that will start a whole new way of thinking in this next generation. I certainly hope so because this world is in desperate need of reinvention.

858,bismuthine,Deceiving overall,7,5 January 2006,"(My apology for mistakes, I am french speaking) I had great expectation about this movie. However, in the end, I have to say, I was more bored than anything else. Of course, the cinematography was brilliant, main acting was decent though the supporting actors were even better - wives, girlfriend, stepfather and daughter.This movie brings absolutely nothing new in the vast spectrum of movie about doomed love. Even the homophobia problematic remains barely touch. It is part of the background. Again, in a classical approach, the plot is completely centered on the two main characters. I wished we could have a better glance at the environment which oppress the heroes. Not so much in the form of more homophobic events but more as how people are knit together in this belief system.The first half hour or so on Brokeback Mountain is the best part of the movie. It brings with subtlety how within nature, man get free of inhibition created by a social surrounding. The second part is much too long. We get the point quite fast and repetition in this case does not intensify the feeling, it actually diminishes it.Also, I am not quite sure I really felt sorry for them. May be the acting was not strong enough to make me believe this love affair. I wonder how gay people really felt about it since gay movies have dealt with this issue with much less modesty in the past.In the end, I find I should give a 7 because of a strong beginning, a beautiful cinematography and some excellent scenes - like when the daughter announces she is getting married.",Brokeback Mountain
859,abcdefz1,Observations on the movie; not a full review,8,12 January 2006,"People seem to be responding to BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN as if it's the story of some sort of heroic love. My take on it is much more of a cautionary tale. These two men's lives (and Ennis' family) get pretty destroyed because of the men's refusal to deal with their relationship in an honorable way. There's the argument that their society wouldn't allow it, but there was no one compelling them to marry others and make families while continuing their lies and infidelities  to their wives, families, and each other. I think those things were the seeds of their downfall. Also, as far as ""love"" goes, the film makes me believe that Ennis loved Jack, but Jack Jack just seemed to be horny, you know? He'd drive across the border, he'd try to hook up with a man in a bar, he'd try to hook up with a man and ranch together I know that people (and love) are flawed, but if love is an active thing which seeks the best for others, then this was more of a lust story with some pretty tragic consequences. The most heart-wrenching moment for me was Ennis' wife watching him drive off on another ""fishing trip"" with Jack, knowing he'd chosen Jack over her. He made vows, let's not forget, to her  not Jack.I think Jack and Ennis were victims of a sort, but that doesn't make them heroes, you know? And Randy Quaid's much-maligned redneck... his main problem seemed to be that Jack and Ennis weren't doing their JOBS, not that Jack and Ennis were ""stemming the rose."" Just curious if others have similar observations, agree, or disagree.",Brokeback Mountain
860,Caalong,a truly great achievement in directing,10,6 February 2006,"This is a directing and writing masterpiece. Every scene, every character, every piece of dialogue and every look moves the story forward and adds to the involvement of the audience with these heart wrenching characters. I can't think of any other director who could, or would, been able to take what was essentially a simple short story and add such layers of complexity and tenderness. The little things like swapping of the shirt and the jacket on the hanger, Jack's tears as he drove away and on to Mexico, Jack's mother wordlessly reaching for the bag when she saw what Ennis was holding all say so much. Wow! The acting performances are all uniformly terrific. Jake Gyllenhaal owns the first third of the movie and then Heath Ledger takes over. With a sideways glance, a slight movement of his eyes or a twitch of the mouth Ledger says more than pages of dialogue ever could. While Michelle Williams is receiving more critical acclaim it was Anne Hathaway's scene on the telephone that impressed me. Across the hard façade a whole range of emotion flickers briefly and then fades. She showed pain, empathy, sadness and disappointment, each appearing for a microsecond and then back to the front Laureen was determined to present to Ennis. I must also comment on the amazing performance of Roberta Maxwell as Jack's mother. If that doesn't rip your heart out, you don't have a heart. All of these performances point to one thing  a truly great achievement in directing.I quickly, and probably not accurately, checked the other comments. Take out the ones written by people who seemingly hadn't seen the film but were determined to rate it down on their perception of the story. Then take out those gushing emotional outpourings of people who were determined to give it 10 no matter what. The result is a higher average rating than the rating shown at the time of writing. So what? Serious lovers of cinema as an art form rate this film very highly. I will go back and see it again.",Brokeback Mountain

The scene where Jack and Ennis have the massive argument or the last scene where Ennis remembers Brokeback with guilt and deep sorrow. In my opinion the last twenty minutes of the movie (From Jack's death on) are simply 10/10. Thanks of course to ledger's amazing performance. I thougth he was particularly good in the scene with Jack's parents and the last scene as he contains his tears and even finds difficulty to breath. I have no clue how come they could not give him the Oscar, his work here is superb and its been a while since I'm not so impressed by a performance. So far this has been Ledgers best work.jake is also good, though he got the Oscar-role in my opinion as he is supposedly the one that suffers the most and effectively has th most dialogue, but Ledger with those few words and his body language, eclipses the co-star.The soundtrack was also amazing and ideal. I'm particularly in love with that guitar score, heard at the end, as Ennis views the Brokeback picture. When i hear it i can feel the guilt Ennis feels, which drags my soul down to the ground.Every time i think about it, i have no clue how it got beat by Crash for the best movie and by Hoffman in best actor. Ledger'srole was much harder, and Crash was okay, but not that great, plus this is a much more complex and smart movie that Crash will ever be.

864,PeterDecker,"Beautiful, Moving Film",10,7 January 2006,"Brokeback Mountain is a film about two young men from Wyoming who come to love each other while minding sheep on a mountain in 1963. We chart the course of their lives over the next twenty years.If it wasn't for the reputation of legendary director Ang Lee and the star power of the two handsome leads how many people would go see this ""gay cowboy"" movie? How many are still avoiding it because the main characters are gay?The story is brutally honest and accurately reflects the intensely closeted lives of people living in pre-Stonewall America, especially out in the country. I dare say many people in the United States still live out their lives closeted -- and frankly, given the general level of intolerance I couldn't blame them. The US still has a long way to go in this area.Heath and Jake are Ennis and Jack and as far as I'm concerned Ennis and Jack are real people. They are that fully realized. The Oscar folks showed what kind of cinematic hicks they are when they passed this film over for the BP Oscar. Fools.The soundtrack is elegant. The scenery (Southern Alberta) that frames much of the film is majestic and haunting. Pretty much everything about this movie is haunting.I couldn't get this movie out of my head for weeks. It may not be for everyone, but this is one of the ten best movies I've ever seen. I really loved this film.10/10 for its excellence.",Brokeback Mountain
865,mszybek,So human,10,24 February 2006,"I'll start by telling you that I've seen this movie twice, and that I loved it even more the second time. There were in short five main reasons why I loved so much:*The actors: Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal both did a tough job (in all meanings of the word 'tough') and delivered two of the most fragile and human character in film-history-- Ennis del Mar and Jack Twist. Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams (my new goddess who, after her incredible performance in this film, made me follow Dawson's Creek) are glowing with just as much competence and professionalism as Gyllenhaal and Ledger. *The screenplay: The writers have actually managed to write a screenplay that is far better than the original short story that the movie is based on. *The director: Ang Lee has managed to both remain in complete control in the making of this film and being, as well as being really brave; it is evident that he among other thing has had complete faith in the actors and the casting of them (who would for example have connected The Princess Diaries-Anne Hathaway with a role like Lureen Newsome-Twist?). Brokeback Mountain has forever showed me what a master he is!*The music-score: The first time I saw Brokeback Mountain, I didn't really notice the music and was in such a hurry afterwards that I didn't stay to listen to the music that was played during the rolling of the cast and so on at the end of the movie. But the second time, I noticed the perfection of the music. And then, at the end of the movie, the whole audience stayed and listened to Willie Nelson's version of He was a friend of my. All in all, the music-score was so good, that I kept humming it all the way home from the cinema. *The cinematic photo: Every frame, from the stunning view of Brokeback Mountain to the shabby little town of Riverton, helps driving the movie all the way through. Everyone, absolutely everyone should see Brokeback Mountain. It's not a film about two gay men- it's about love, how it can be ruined by the restrains and hypocrisy of society, and about unbearable loneliness as a result of the former. And if all the world's bigots and racists can't stand one lousy sex-scene (that's right, there's only one!) between two people who love each other, just because they happen to be of the same sex, then it's their loss. Eight academy awards-nominations. Three wins! That's just pure robbery. I've heard that because Phillip Seymor-Hoffman won the best actor-award for Capote and Crash became the best film of the year, this year's academy awards was really controversial. I beg to differ; it is not controversial, if the jury clearly still has a problem nominating and giving the Oscars to people who plays Hitler (I'm talking about Bruno Ganz in Downfall two years ago), or who's character has sex with another man! Like I said: Pure robbery...",Brokeback Mountain
866,gcmorris,all hyped up and no place to go...,10,14 December 2005,"the rule goes that the artistic success of a film is in direct inverse relationship to the amount of hype surrounding it. you know - the quiet sleeper no one's heard of breaking all box-office records vs. the-most-anticipated-film-event-of-the-decade showing up at blockbuster on DVD a week after it opens, and so it goes with ""brokeback mountain.""although i was deeply moved by annie proulx's short story, and i count ang lee's ""ice storm"" and ""crouching tiger..."" among my favorite films, sadly this film falls short of its mark. don't get me wrong  this is not a bad movie, it just does not live up to the hype nor deliver the emotional impact of the original material. first, i want to address some of the cacophonous hype surrounding it: the sex  it's not nearly as graphic nor as prolific as in the short story. the film seems to self-consciously pull away from the sensuality of the book and while it may make the film more palatable to a wider audience, ultimately the film suffers from it. without the visual cue provided by the physical relationship, it's hard to feel the intensity of the connection between the two lead characters. (and why is sex so much harder to accept in film than graphic violence???) the nudity  very brief, non-sexual (skinny dipping, bathing) and then only in long shot, completely tasteful and appropriate. again, why is the human body capable of stirring up so much controversy??? people just need to get over their body issues! the effect  so much has been written about how this movie will enlighten everyone's concept of gay relationships. i honestly doubt it. if you liked gay people before seeing this movie, you will still like them. if you didn't like gay people before seeing this movie, you still won't like them. it's really not that transformative.the acting  heath ledger wears his wyoming cowboy much like he wears his scrunchy cowboy hat  available at any mall, pre-distressed cowboy hats are quite popular these days, but they don't carry the psychic weight of the real thing - worn, used, and abused by an authentic cowboy. his performance is superficial  it looks real, but it doesn't feel real. without the sensuous descriptions in proux's story, the flatlined cowboy character with few words isn't very engaging.great location and amazing cinematography make the film visually pleasing. the production design really captures the character and culture of wyoming ranchers. the film follows the original story closely, just not intimately, so while it's a very good movie, it's not a great movie.",Brokeback Mountain

From the opening shot, we can see that this film is set in the time of modern cowboys, in the year 1963. After all the film's hype, you might enter the film with high expectations... too high for some people's taste, as you are expecting a slow start. Well, the film leaps right into it's story, and within a few minutes, you will be soaring the heights of Brokeback Mountain.Ennis (Heath Ledger) is the first of the two characters that we look at closely. He is a rough cowboy, with a tough past of family death, and sibling love. We don't see much of Jack's (Jake) past until later in the film. And then the scenes that all have been waiting for appear. The ones that were banned in areas of the US, and condemned by the catholic church. Jack and Ennis get intimate, Although you may feel that the film leaps into relationship too quickly, that is a small price to pay for such a wonderful film.Steven Spielburg stands no chance these Oscars, and that's coming from a devoted Spielburg fan.",Brokeback Mountain
868,alexis-muirhead,One of film's best love stories. End of sentence.,10,22 January 2006,"I went to see this film at a late show in a theatre in southern Ontario. The audience was a mixed group: a few older couples, some big groups of teenagers (who were audibly awkward during the one or two sex scenes) and a few singles. I smiled a little at the single guys in the audience, remembering a comment that ""Brokeback Mountain"" isn't really a date movie, and it's certainly not the kind of movie a guy can go see on his own, or with his close friend, and so men might not go see the film at all. This in an article questioning the film's ability to make good box office.Anyway, the film was beautifully shot (all those mountains and rivers and trees made me a little homesick for BC), well-acted and nicely understated in its material and intellectual choices. It's probably one of the best movie romances I've ever seen, and I really appreciated the way the screenplay didn't dodge the ripples of pain and heartbreak caused by Jack and Ennis' relationship, while still managing to spell out that the love affair should have and would have turned out well, if this were a better world. This wasn't a didactic film by any means, for better and for worse. And it's not exactly the film that those easy ""gay cowboy movie"" labels would have you believe.This was a Western in the most traditional sense, about emotionally-strangled men who are more at home on the range than they are in their own skin. The gay love affair, so honestly and gently handled by Ang Lee, builds to a slow burn of longing and is deeply steeped in the misery of lost years. This trope is familiar to Westerns (men forsake or lose the one woman who might make them happy through a combination of circumstance and their own nature) and I suppose one can easily (and dismissively) argue that the only reason people are interested in ""Brokeback"" at all is because it offers a new spin on this old idea. However, by the film's sad, quiet conclusion, I couldn't shake the idea that I'd seen something new, not just an old pairing with a new orientation, but a new take on the West, on masculinity and on dramatic storytelling. The film is subtle but it works, and I hope people who wouldn't normally go see a ""gay cowboy movie"" might check this one out. Even if you have to go see it alone.",Brokeback Mountain

They don't mean to, but it is just something that is in nature that just takes hold of them. This is an all star cast, with an ending that would make any person wonder,""why?""

871,korisx,My two cents.,10,7 February 2006,"Watching this movie was very refreshing because it wasn't fast moving like most new releases are. It doesn't use tricks or gimmicks to keep your interest just raw honesty (Well as much as a fictional story can be anyway).I've read some of the comments posted in the hated it section where some people called it boring and summed it up to be a little unrealistic. I just have a few questions on that matter: Was it boring because it wasn't as fast paced as most of the movies being released are? I personally found it an enlightening experienced as I like fast paced movies, and at first when watching this movie I was thinking to myself 'Oh God this could be bad'. But after watching it I figured Ang Lee wants the Audience to prepare themselves for the rest of the movie by slowing down the pace and allowing the audience to concentrate on what makes the film personable. This is isn't any easy thing to get use to for someone like me who likes his action films.As for the unrealistic side, there were some comments about how the relationship just happened Suddenly, neither one hinted at interest at each other before they got down to the action. I think Ang did purposely addressed this point when Ennis was naked and around Jack. Jack didn't even look or pretend to look. I'm just wondering how many gay men back in those days would have had the courage to look at any guy they found attractive even sideways :-) .In contrast there was a comment about when they were kissing outside the steps of Ennis's house and Alma saw them. The comment made was how no one would have the courage to do something like that where the risk of getting caught is pretty high, I would have to agree. It makes me think though of what Ennis said to Jack on the Mountain ""I figure we got a one-shot deal going on here."" I was wondering if they were just acting like a couple of puppies who've been given a ball for the first time, just a little bit of recklessness, granted that came with serious consequences.I am gay and my partner and I both come from a small town. When we first started going out he wanted to hold hands on parts of streets he thought were empty. I thought that was crazy. The part where Ennis and Jack were caught by Alma made me think of that.All in all I loved this movie, I'm thinking about buying it on DVD.",Brokeback Mountain
872,ynotmd,"eh, not terrible",5,28 January 2006,"Yesterday I saw Brokeback Mountain, the infamous movie that amalgamates the classic hegemonic masculinity of the American western with the feminine sensitivity of a gay Romance. Commenting on this movie is a difficult task, because it raises questions about what exactly makes a good movie good. First of all, Ang lee is generally considered one of the better directors out of Asia. His style was birthed in the hongkong cinema and eventually we came to know him in North America through such movies as 'the hulk.' But after watching his North American movies I have to ask, ""where is the Chinese side of Ang Lee?"" His film-making is highly Americanized. Now, because he makes American style movies doesn't make his movies bad. The American style in some cases is the best, citing Hitchcock and Hawks as examples. But they were Auteur, letting their personal style shine through the Hollywood formula. Here resides my central criticism of Brokeback; it lacks personal style. The movie has a sound screen play with great cinematography and pretty good acting. It is a story about two lovers separated by fate, that fate being the obligations they must fulfill to society at large. But if this was not about gay lovers it would essentially be like Romeo and Juliet shot in the Alberta Rockies. The movie lacks any specific social commentary, and is totally devoid of artistic integrity. It is a well-made move, but not a great movie. Not one that deserves recognition as a work of art. The movie is representational, presenting a story that is easy to fall into, but presenting little about what the writer or director actually thinks the problem or solution is. There is little ideological basis for the movie, and foremost I think people are fooled into thinking the movie has intense ideology because it deals with gay subject matter. But as I read earlier, because a movie deals with controversial subject matter, that doesn't make it a deep or good movie. So watch it, and keep in mind that you are watching a literal and uninspired interpretation of Romeo and Juliet with a hook, they are gay.",Brokeback Mountain

I understand that that standing up for yourself is sometimes hard especially given the environment but the relationship suffered the worst of consequences without even doing so.What message does this send out? I'm not sure. It could be read in different ways, but surely if this was a work of art the message should have been less opaque, if however it wasn't art then it simply wasn't entertaining enough.With such mixed messages and a lack of inspiring real emotional empathy it is just a pretty film. It's good, thought provoking, but whatever it tries to do it doesn't quite do it. Better luck next time.Worth a watch but not the film of the year.",Brokeback Mountain

I read and heard many times times that this was about the ""love"" between two persons, but for me it's difficult to associate love with a purely physical relation. Love between two persons should imply something more than the urge to share the same bed or place among them or else cats and dogs can also show the same love than this but in much more intensive way. I am not gay, but I do like gay movies like the ones from Derek Jarman. It's sad to see so much support for something so shallow as this movie.

Why? because of the silences that speak louder than words; the sparse musical score that rings in your ears long after; the economical script that conveys more than the actual dialog; the precise acting that could have easily degenerated into melodrama under insensitive directing; the vast expanse of the mountainside (their love nest) vs the constricting dusty towns (their hornets' nest); the stock character fleshed out by Ledger that will be a reference for many actors for years to come; and last but not least the heart felt tears shed by ALL the main characters (including the babies!)

However, all those restrictions make their relationship special, and the director, Ann Li, intends to make this movie's love beyond gender. Unlike other places in the south, Brokeback mountain is so elegant and quiet. This landscape difference implies their love and the real life. In the society, Jack and Ennis both have families and jobs, but they against all odds to meet at Brokeback mountain to love each other.

The opportunity to make a great film was lost after the first act (literally). They failed to deliver any real emotion or sympathy for the characters. Personally, I cannot believe Ang Lee won Best Director. The movie spans 20+ years and the major players never age? The actresses that played the wives still looked twelve years old. That was painful and distracting, but the real deal breaker was the two separate Thanksgiving scenes with the long shots of the obviously cold turkeys being carved. Horrible.

You got married to a woman and had babies. You have responsibilities, your wants and needs can't come first anymore. Make a decision to leave or stay but it doesn't entitle you to lie, neglect your wife and kids, and get mad at her for maybe wanting to live a freer life.

But towards the end, the viewer really gets a personal view of one of the gay cowboy's tragic love for the other. It was kind of scary because one of the men reminded me A lot of my father, and made me wonder...what he is doing when he goes with his friend's on trips or has to work away with them. For those with 1 sided views on how all gay/lesbian/bi people are completely ridiculous, it makes you see somewhat their side of things and the force that pushes behind uncontrollable love.

884,camrik505,An opportunity to reflect on our own lives...whichever side of the fence,7,29 August 2006,"Controversial on a number of levels, yet tame by a number of standards, this is a film that will reach its audience in different ways, depending on their own personal journey - whether gay or straight. How we receive this movie - and how we relate - is indicative of where we're at in our own lives - and this is what makes this film brilliant. We follow the story of Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) and Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal) who fall unexpectedly in love during a stint as a pair of sheep herders in Wyoming during the 1960's. What follows is the struggle to keep their desires hidden from a prejudiced society and the agony of remaining committed to their marriages while living double lives. There is a consistent undertone of melancholy throughout this film, from beginning to end, and some viewers will find this heavy. But this doesn't detract from the point conveyed by Ang Lee, its director. The impressive feature of this movie is the fact that every actor puts in a solid performance - in particular some of the ""peripheral"" actors - and this is quite rare in films where quite a number of the performers have very small roles. (Look at Anna Faris 'Lashawn Malone'; Kate Mara 'Alma Del Mar, Jr.', age 19; and Roberta Maxwell 'Jack's mother' for outstanding examples.) In terms of the main actors, Michelle Williams is outstanding, and Anne Hathaway almost steals the show! The only thing that seems to leave the film falling flat is the fact that there doesn't seem to be a positive resolution. Some will take this as an indication that gay men will end up facing tragedy and be confined to a life of loneliness. And we all might need to watch this with English subtitles, because for a majority of the film, we cannot understand what Heath Ledger's mumbled dialogue! This is incredibly disappointing - particularly considering that he delivers the very final line in the film and I am still unable to figure out what it is! (I'll have to get the DVD and throw on the subtitles!!) However, this film certainly does provoke an emotional response. And whether that response is one of anger, disgust, sadness, happiness, elation, denial, self-loathing, confusion, relief, empathy or curiosity, you are alive during those two hours.

885,mightymountaingorilla,A movie I will cherish forever...,10,9 January 2006,"For those not familiar, BBM is the story of two cowboys who are hired to work together watching sheep for a rancher. After many lonely nights, the two start up a friendship that later evolves into a romantic relationship. However, after the ranching job is finished, both go their separate ways, and yet, are never out of each others' hearts.For the next 20+ years, both get married and have children, but are able to go on ""fishing trips"" to Brokeback Mountain where they emotionally and physically reunite. As each of their families grow farther apart from them, and as they realize that, more than anything, they want to be with one another, the story takes on the air of a classically epic romance.The movie is absolutely gorgeous, not only in its portrayal of the rugged landscapes, but in its understanding of human relationships. The story understands that these two men, having grown up in the circumstances that they have, can never come out of the closet and must keep any of their natural human desires under wraps. Sometimes, when they don't understand their own feelings, it even manifests itself as violence against the other. The movie, at times, can feel a bit restrained, but then again, isn't that also a reflection of the attitudes of the main characters and their choice to be apart? Whenever Jack and Ennis reunite, the movie explodes with life and happiness, just like the characters do. And it's heart breaking when they have to part again.As we see these men age, kept apart by conservative social conventions, and all the while, longing only to be with one another, their lives and dreams unrealized forever, we understand how great a tragedy this story is. How many of us could bear to live a life where we can only see the person we love once or twice a year with no hope of permanent reconciliation? Jack even says at one point, ""I wish I knew how to quit you."" This movie touched me on such a deep level that I cannot get these characters and their lives out of my mind. My heart aches for them. My stomach was in bends as I walked out of the theater. The movie is that powerful. Moreover, the actors all do such an incredible job of making their characters believable and natural. And Heath Ledger's performance should get him an Oscar nomination. When everyone in the world expects gay people to be overly-flamboyant and feminine, here we have the paramount of masculinity (cowboys). Ennis almost has to have the words pulled out of his mouth. After a conversation about his family, he tells Jack that those are the most words he's spoken in a year. He's so blank at times, and yet, if you look at his eyes and the way he keeps his mouth, you'll see the layers of conversation and thought he is having in his own mind and yet culminate in only one or two word sentences when he speaks. Jack is the wide-eyed, hopeful partner, with one foot always in a fantasy world, while Ennis' are deeply planted in reality. As you see these two men wandering in and out of their forced heterosexual relationships, you can't help but wonder what could have been had they followed their hearts. There's always that feeling in the hearts of the characters and in the audience of ""if only."" This movie shows the consequences of not being true to yourself--how these characters slowly degrade over the years from not being with who they truly love. However, this is one of the most tragic and yet, life-affirming movies of the year. It shows us the sadness of not believing in who and what you are, and yet, the all-encompassing power of love.In my opinion, this is the best movie of the year, and I hope all of you get a chance to see it. Ang Lee (the director) has done it again. It is a thing of beauty when a movie is this good.",Brokeback Mountain

Everyone's superlatives don't do it justice. I have waited my life for a movie like this. Everything about it is right. One of the things I really liked is that it so clearly shows the brutal impact of homophobic culture, that it was homophobia that ruins the lives of these characters. It also captures the breathtaking beauty of the Rockies and what makes the West a place that has its own rewards for living in (I'm originally from Wyoming and many of the details were perfect, such as the sound of wind that is a ubiquitous presence in Wyoming). Jake Gylenhaal was wonderful (and beautiful) and Heath Ledger gave a performance of a lifetime. In the end it's the humanity that shines. See it and weep (seriously - you need a handkerchief with this one, regardless of your orientation). Brokeback Mountain will surely be remembered as not just the best film of 2005, but one of the great works in cinematic history.",Brokeback Mountain
887,ruggero26,i'm not saying bad...i'm crying ineptitude!!!,3,10 April 2006,"so, clearly by my rating and title, you can tell i didn't see this film in a favourable light. most of the reasons listed prior fall into place, with a few additions besides (not only is ledger unintelligable, he doesn't even really have it in the eyes. at least jake had it in the eyes...but his eyes always do. and even that wasn't enough in this case!). but the thing that really gets me is the ""concession"" of most haters... magnificent cinematography? which film, exactly, are you speaking of? the feature, or any one of the previews you saw before it? ang lee is a director who knows how to tell a story with images. he is also a director who knows how to move a camera to best tell it. so my question is....did the 2nd unit guy make this movie, and ang just sort of hung out with the krafts services? static frames can be effective and affecting. in the hands of, say, David lynch, the static shot can be a thing of beauty or terror or both. ang...what the hell? i know you had a dolly, a crane, or at least a swivel-headed tripod. you spent money on them. why did you not use them at all? okay okay...i know. i can hear you all now...""but dario, what about the subtext to those static shots? what about the symbolism?"" you mean the many loving shots of the sheep, suggesting that they are just two in a herd, unable to break away from the herd mentality? yeah. subtle. not at all heavy handed and preachy... plus...helps to have characters who we care about. i can dig on letting the images tell me who that character is, i can let their facial expressions and actions speak for them...but one thing i need to be able to do that is a character who does something, emotes anything, once in a while. once even during the first hour and a half would be nice! look, if the flick can open even one bigot's mind to the possibility that homosexuality should not be the defining characteristic by which an individual is judged, good on all involved. get people talking, thinking...good for society on whole. though i fail to see how anything so mind-numbingly dull and inept as this Oscar-worthy mess could stimulate anything but sleep. oh yeah...the score. leave the two-note repetitions to kubrick, ang...anyone notice how my review just kind of petered out there without any significant ""closure""? how it just kind of meandered and tried to build to something, got off on a little tangent, and then just quit? thats my impersonation of any given scene in this film. perhaps they ought've commandeered a title from bukowski...""strokes to nowhere"".",Brokeback Mountain

890,ginal987,The best movies touch your soul,10,18 December 2007,"2096th review that is really meant more to be an outlet for me... I was reluctant to see this film. I'm not gay. I'm not a man. I'm not religious. I have no problem with gay marriage or gay rights. I was however pretty sick of hearing from both the oh so intolerant and hypocritical right wing loudmouths about gay people and also rather sick of hearing from gay rights' people and having shows/movies about gay people shoved in my face, or so I felt. So in the midst of all this, this movie comes out and the brouhaha reaches a fever pitch, souring my mood. I was also reluctant to watch because I would like more movies to be about WOMEN. But here was a movie with two male leads, having a relationship where they basically hang a sign around their necks saying ""no girls allowed."" Did not make me eager to watch.So one day I'm in a video store and see 5 dvds for $20. The DVDs were pretty slim pickings but there was Brokeback Mountain. I thought what the hell. It's only 4 bucks.When I think what I would have missed out on if I did not see this movie... Ang Lee has made wonderful movies but none of his other movies have ever struck such an emotional chord. The aching and longing the movie leaves one with is difficult to articulate. Being an obsessive personality, watching this movie might not be the healthiest thing as it has drawn me in so strongly, reality is removed, and my mind is in a fog.As I watched, I forgot they were two men. What gender they were became irrelevant. Their relationship and intimacy was so natural.The sweetest love scene I have ever seen, beautiful music starts, Jack is in the background in the tent, getting ready for bed, we see glimpses of skin, Ennis sits in front of the fireplace, glances over at the tent, looks at the fire, then slowly gets up and kind of slouches towards the tent, his hat in his hands, creating space between him and Jack. Jack touches his hand, ""it's alright."" Ennis' face, how to describe his expression, longing, vulnerability, need, a desire to touch and be touched, as the soft music reaches a crescendo. It's inescapably beautiful and so tender.Heath Ledger is so unbelievably vulnerable and brings this contrast to Ennis. In one minute, threatening Jack and the next crying, a man lost. The little touches and mannerisms, always shoving his shirt into his pants...I, as so many others, was simply blown away by his performance and absolutely fell heartbreakingly in love with Ennis. To not watch this movie is to miss a rare experience, to not feel something almost palpable. Ignore the hype, ignore the crap. See this movie because it speaks universally to the human experience. Ang Lee described it as ""a love story"" but it is more than that, so much more... An unbelievably potent movie, an exceptional experience.***modified to add, Heath Ledger, you will be sorely missed. I honestly cannot think of a character in a movie that has touched me so profoundly. A heartbreaking movie and a heartbreaking reality.***",Brokeback Mountain
891,KoondoggSaints,Amazingly not amazing...,8,15 February 2006,"I just saw Brokeback and I have to say that it is a very good movie. The most amazing thing surrounding the film is that it is just an above average love story, and when you watch it, this is what you think of. I was amazed at how the emphasis was put on love and a forbidden relationship, instead of the fact that the parties involved were gay. I went into the film with reservations like most men would, but I came out feeling like I had be suckered into another 'chic flick.' And for this I applaud Ang Lee. To make such a controversial topic seem like a normal movie is amazing to me. I went in expecting Fahrenheit 911 and walked out as if I had watched March of the Penguins. This is a very good movie and I encourage every person who enjoys a love story to watch it, and every other person to watch how easy it is to accept a homosexual relationship as you would any other relationship.",Brokeback Mountain
892,NORWOLF1,Disappointed,6,28 December 2005,"This was a highly disappointing film. As a gay man, I thought I finally would be able to see true affection between two men on screen. But, we hardly see any affection between the two leads. We see sex on Brokeback Mountain. But, sex is not affection, is not love. And when the Heath and Jake meet a couple times a year they might as well be fishing buddies. Again, we see hardly any affection. I was not touched by the ending because I feel that the relationship between the two leads was never fully developed. I never really felt they were in love. If they truly were, Heath would have moved in with Jake or at least lived near him after Ennis got divorced.The affection between Ennis and his wife is more developed than between Heath and Jake's characters. I felt sorry for Ennis's wife. Everyone go hurt, Ennis' wife and Jake's character, because Ennis couldn't accept that he is gay. He couldn't grow to accept himself and have the courage to risk everything to have what he wanted. Many gay men take this risk. I did. Why can't these characters?This is a movie about people being stuck, not taking changes. So, they end up alone and everyone gets hurt. No one grew as a character in this movie. No one really took risks. I wanted to see a movie where people took risks and fought against the society that keeps them from having what they want. This is not the movie. I also wanted to see a movie where a character came to accept his homosexuality. This is not the movie.Highly disappointing.",Brokeback Mountain
893,valkelis,What blew me away,10,13 February 2006,"Let me share my excitement.I saw it Saturday night for the FIRST time but have been living with the story for a year and a half, now. I knew every line, I felt the wooden floor boards shake when Jack stepped on them, how could I not, I've read it half a dozen times at least, but seeing it played out was a wonder and a revelation. I'm jumping way ahead of myself.I expected to cry... I didn't. I was prepared (if that is possible), emotionally, for the devastation that this movie causes in people, so I didn't cry. I also thought that I was prepared for the level of acting that was displayed in the movie. Wrong, I wasn't. Nothing could prepare me for that. I knew that the actors were good, but, oh my God, this was brilliant. I was totally breath taken.Heath. I wish I knew the way to describe how amazing this man is. There is no Heath, whatsoever, in Ennis, not one little bit. It's like the character takes over, absorbs itself in every pore... he feels Ennis, he breathes Ennis, he IS Ennis. Perfect acting, perfect portrayal... lust, fear, self hatred, longing, love, despair, pain and in a few brief moments, happiness. PERFECT! He blew me away.Jake. Let me first say that, so far, he has not been on my list of the dearest actors. With what he did here, he entered. It just seems so easy, the way he embodies Jack, the right amount of smiles, determination, hope for things wanted but impossible. The scene where he's driving away and ""Love that will never grow old"" plays in the background, tears in his eyes and then spite as he enters Mexico... but not only that, everything, nothing is missed. He also blew me away.Michelle and Anne. What Dawson's Creek? What Princess Diaries? Where? I never saw the story from their point of view. I didn't really care about them. Until now, that is. Now I feel them. One completely vulnerable, the other stone cold. What power. Kudos, ladies.The rest of the cast as well. Perfect. (I use a lot of perfect, I know.) Favourite scenes. All of them... well, OK, there are some that hit me in the gut more then others. Ennis in the alley after they part. Jack stroking Ennis's face with his fingers as they sit by the fire, post-reunited, and Ennis accepts that, smiling just a little. And THE ONE. Ennis embracing Jack from behind, holding him, loving him.This movie is wonderful, powerful, teaching and damn well crafted... take the chance, see it. But also, take the chance that life places before you. Even if you're never completely satisfied by it. Grasp it for as long as you can. (I paraphrased one critic here.) I'm gonna do just that.",Brokeback Mountain

Amidst a world of the trite and overrated, Brokeback steps beside itself and delivers an awe-inspiring tale of love and the consequences we endure.Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger give some of the most honest, brave performances that we have seen in a long time. To take such a chance and exposing themselves emotionally and stretching as only actors of high respectability can, these two men should be commended for their efforts.Brokeback will make the coldest heart turn warm as it follows the tale of two cowboys and their relationship over twenty years. Ang Lee's direction is beautiful as it never settles too long on any scene to let the audience feel the world never stops for any single person.The final scene between Gyllenhaal and Ledger is that of the greats, truly gut-wrenching and perfectly performed. Gyllenhaal and Ledger have truly matured to movie stardom.Everyone should see this film as it will open up the eyes of the general public to see love for what it truly is, a special entity between any people.",Brokeback Mountain

I had nothing to do and it was the one year anniversary of Heath Ledgers death. I had been wanting to see this film for so long but just never got around to it. I thought this would be the perfect day to sit down and enjoy a film.I was expecting the movie to be good but in all honesty i wasn't expecting it to be this amazing. It gave me shivers and it left me speechless. I thought the starting of the film was beautiful. Neither of the men talking for about 5 minutes, you just watch them wait.This was a movie that showed me love. It had me in tears numerous times and the stronger the bond got between Ennis and Jack, the more and more i got in to this film.It was truly amazing. The acting, the writing, everything about it just blew me away. I had no idea i could feel like this after watching a movie. When the last lines were said i just sat there in awe. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhal gave outstanding performances.This movie taught me so much about life, so much about love. It showed me the world in ways i haven't looked at it before. From the beginning of their love affair from when it ended with Jack dying i truly felt like my heart was falling apart watching this movie.It gave a message that i hope could help so many peoples lives. As i sit here and write this i have trouble finding the correct words to describe this film. It was just too amazing for words.One of the best movies i have ever seen.

To all this must be added refined decorations and music in perfect harmony that give this film a rare formal beauty.

It is now Sunday, and I am still consumed with thoughts and feelings about the story, the acting, the directing, the cinematography. So much is going on here that perhaps may have gone unnoticed by a younger audience (I'm 56)...the poverty from childhood on (even for Jack as evidenced by his sparse bedroom), Ennis's lack of education, the terrible parenting (particularly by Ennis's father), dying young without realizing your dreams, living on with the regret and loneliness, the trap that these men were in, and the hurt/heartbreak of the women who loved them.Heath was astounding, but Jake's Jack was so terribly wonderful as well. And the two of them playing off each other..incredible. Also, Michelle...the three blew me away, and if each doesn't win their respective Oscars, they will have been robbed.I have been a movie buff for 35 years. This was a movie as affecting it its own right as a ""doomed"" love story as any I've ever seen, including Gone with the Wind.

However Brokeback Mountain was one of the poorest films I have ever seen, it was so slow and boring and the ending was tragic, however this did not move me at all, I felt no need to cry, the only time I felt like tears was at the end, when I felt I had been robbed of my £3 to rent this movie. I would love to have a conversation with other people about why they felt this movie was so strong, the cinematography besides, which was the best part of the movie, has been bettered in many movies (notably the also very boring but amazingly shot - The New World) and Dances with Wolves.I had my TV at full volume and I still struggled to hear the drivle coming out of Heath Ledgers mouth, I felt the dialogue was poor and am really starting to question myself when i see so many bad comments, does no one agree with me???????",Brokeback Mountain

After all the big buildup I expected better from Ang Lee. I also think he could have delivered the story with more finesse than simply having these two guys rushing back to Brokeback Mountain to 'fish' every chance they got.I know this film is controversial because it's about a gay relationship.

I am a 15 year old, straight male. I had no intentions on really seeing this movie when I was younger, because of all of the jokes about it being just gay sex. Let me end these rumors now, it is not a film about sex. It isn't really a film about sexuality in general, it's about humans.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal both do an excellent job in their roles. I will admit that some parts of this movie, I had tears in my eyes. I don't know if I was upset for the characters, or was happy. It was just too many emotions to handle.I would recommend this film to anyone who loves film. This is some of the finest acting I have seen in a while, and one of the best screenplays.

904,Ikari9,Great story meets bad storytelling,5,29 May 2006,"The story of this film is, needless to say, very controversial but also very good. Two cowboys fall in love with each other but society forces them to hide it and attempt to live normal lives. Their trip together is the basis of the first hour of the film while the remainder spans 20-25 years of their lives following the events. The set up is fine, the problem is the execution of it all.Jack is the more obvious gay cowboy, he hides it but you see he is always dying to let it out but it is society that forces him to keep it in. Ennis plays the gay cowboy that seems to keep it in because he is ashamed just as much as society would shame him for it. The main issue is how this entire plot starts. There is no buildup to it. The first 30 minutes or so are the two of them working on Brokeback, herding sheep and drinking. There is no real character development, you don't learn either admits to being gay and the two never really bond whatsoever. But before you know it, Jack is grabbing Ennis' hand and placing it into his crotch, and then they have rough sex. There just is not a buildup to it, and despite struggling with their feelings for literally 20 years, you never once feel as though Ennis truly feels that way towards Jack. He is not a likable character at all, and while Jack routinely offers him a life together, and confesses how he feels, Ennis consistently turns him down, and doesn't say anything to him, but then threatens to kill him if he leaves? Perhaps it is because the two actors felt too awkward acting out real emotions to each other, but all we are left with are two one-sided, very stereotypical cowboy figures who, despite being 'in love', never have a single reason to show it in the first place. I don't know if the intention was to display Ennis in a constant struggle of how he feels and coming to terms with his homosexuality or if he was meant to play the abusive and controlling ass who treats everyone poorly that Jack can't help but fall for. He spends 95% of this film acting like an ass and treating everyone horribly, but the other 5% is spent showing his true feelings. It all makes for a very confusing and random adventure.",Brokeback Mountain

My husband believes that he was killed by the exploding tire, just like his wife said, and the brief film of a man being beaten was Ennis's flashback to the story he was told as a child. I thought that the wife actually knew that he was beaten to death (hence the brief film) and was lying to Ennis. What does everyone else think of this? I loved this film. I think that some homophobes don't because the film points out that this might happen to anyone in that circumstance, and not just to those who are openly homosexual. I thought that the love story was beautiful. What's important is not who you love, but THAT you love.",Brokeback Mountain
906,gav_walmsley,The most beautiful Film ever made,10,28 April 2011,"I have never cried in a film before. I have become weak in films before, but never have i actually been brought to tears. This film managed to do it on four separate occasions.I found this movie on TV late one night and decided to watch it not knowing what to expect. It killed me inside. It haunted me. There was not a moment for the next week when i did not think about this film. It drew me into the complexity of Jack and Ennis' romance and the shear beauty and sadness of their relationship and it still hasn't let me go two months later.The way in which Jack and Ennis express their love shattered me. The pure passion mixed with aggression, doubt, confusion and sadness drained me. So a huge thumbs up to Jake G and Heath L for outstanding performances.The story is simple, but complex. Two straight men are sent off into the mountains where they are intended to managed herds of sheep and whilst there a romance forms between them.FIRSTLY let me start off by saying this is not a feel good gay romance story. In fact the purpose of the film is not even to comment on homosexuality. The film uses the romance that forms between Jack and Ennis to express the sublimity of love. And it did it flawlessly. The film explains that love knows no sex or boundaries, that it is a force that emerges without warning.Honestly, Titanic could learn something from this film. I only cried because it was so devastating to see how madly in love Jack and Ennis were with each other, and yet society forbid their romance. Okay so maybe the film does make a comment about homosexuality, but the side that no-one ever sees really. It explores the possibility of same sex relationships that ensue without warning, and how it entraps the two in a truly saddening relationship.The camera work is beautiful and so is the soundtrack particularly in the opening scene. However, there was one technical fault as such, where the rule known as the ""180 degree line"" was ""broken"" and Jack and Ennis were walking away from each other and due to the camera work it looked like they were walking the same way.Okay so the part you've hopefully been waiting for... the parts when i cried. Basically i cried at the parts when the true nature of their relationship was revealed e.g. when they made out passionately but almost frustratedly after not having seen each other for four years and when Ennis said (in the most amazing line i've ever heard) ""I wish I could quit you."" And of course when the most horrible thing in th history of film ever happens which i can't put in this review because it needs to be experienced.If you take the time to dive further into the film, you realise just how sad the story is. The fact that they have to live false lives for twenty years because of what society says made me both depressed and enraged. The fact that they still maintained their relationship through the years even though it was evident that both were unhappy and needed each other hurt me on the inside.This film hit far too close to home for me. It expresses love in the most true and devastatingly beautiful way imaginably. No other artistic piece describes love the way this film does. It doesn't matter if you are gay or straight, the movie isn't about gay people, it's about expressing the most complex part of the human condition through a relationship between two straight men in love.It destroys me to think that there are people in the world whom are secretly in love and oppressed because of the one emotion that no person to date understands. And believe you me, this film would have been nothing had it been between two straight people. The movie was as powerful as it was because of the fact that it was between to men.Thank the lord for this film. It is breathtaking. It will linger with you for days after watching it. This is something every person needs to experience. One of the best films i have ever seen, and by far the most powerful and beautiful film i will possibly ever see.",Brokeback Mountain

Seeing the film dispelled all my worries and over came the hype, the film is simply marvelous and the run up to it was drowned out by the simple beauty of a love story exquisitely told. Though the film moves slowly it is by no means boring, the acting fills up the space and the beautiful filming makes up for the sparse dialog. None of the hype could even touch the film once it started, every aspect was flawless and drew me in easily. After leaving the theater my friends and I couldn't say much about the film, we had no complaints and no vocabulary to explain what we had seen.

I had a similar reaction at the end of (also) Ang Lee's ""Wedding Banquet"", when Winston Chao's father raised his hands over his body in response to the airport metal detectors, and that was the final shot...taking wing into eternity.Even more compelling was how that same actor in a different and later Ang Lee film was the one who bagged the young, elfin mom much to our surprise in ""Eat, Drink, Man, Woman.""

This movie was so heartbreakingly beautiful that you feel almost compelled to watch it. When I started to discover what this movie was revolved around, I had no problem with it. I saw it as a love story like any other. Because that's exactly what it was. It was about two people struggling with their feelings and fighting with reality. But at the same time I couldn't help but feel bad for the families that they had created separately. As it wasn't fair for them not to be together, it wasn't fair for their families to be neglected. And Heath Ledger's marriage suffered from that. Which of course adds to the tragic of this story. Overall, I think that this was a movie that is very much needed and I hope people will see it for what it's worth.",Brokeback Mountain

I mean did they really need to make under the Tuscan sun? I don't see how that piece of shi* was not controversial for being so damn crappy and a waste of time.

This is a very outstanding achievement in storytelling, acting and directing. I am now beginning to cry for Ennis, Jack, and their respective families. I cry for the the ignorant who will not allow natural true love to exist. I cry for the innocent who are unable to change their fate. I cry for the loneliness of the many Enniss' of the world who are unable to live their god given lives. I cry for the many men and women who have died for being something other than heterosexual.The Academy voters will give strong consideration to this great film. I am in awe of the magnificence landscapes and scenery. I felt as if I was on Brokeback Mountain. Mr. Ang's superb direction was extremely focused. The acting by all involved was especially pleasing. Mr. ledger and Mr. Gyllanhall should definitely receive Oscars for their performances. Ms. Williams was also exceptional.",Brokeback Mountain

916,dimension04,This film is a lot more than a movie. It's a deep look at human vulnerability.,9,15 April 2006,"Caution: my review here alludes to a key plot element that newbies to the movie would no doubt rather not know.In reading all about Brokeback Mountain on IMDb, I am stunned to learn about the short-story origin of this movie. It appeared in The New Yorker magazine in 1997, and as in the film, a main character lives in Wyoming and is eventually brutally killed by gay-bashers.It's rather disturbing that this story was published one year before Matthew Shepard in Wyoming was in reality brutally killed by gay-bashers. I am so hoping Annie Proulx's work had nothing to do with that terrible coincidence a year later. I wouldn't think that such types would ever read a New Yorker story to begin with, but maybe it got around and some brutes there took offense and decided to ""make a statement"" -- or make it come true.Adding to the troubling nature of this, Annie lives or lived near the spot where Matthew was murdered, and she was even screened for jury duty for the trial. Needless to say, she was not selected! For me, this adds a dimension of reality to the movie about the crazy fear and hatred some people project onto gays. I'm a straight female, but I just can't understand the rage that gay-bashers feel -- and I think some ancient Bible quotes are just an excuse for it, not a source of it. The sorrow and tragedy and vast loneliness in this movie, accurately depicted, takes viewers to a deeper level on this whole issue and starkly raises the question: What are the anti-gays really afraid of?",Brokeback Mountain

It is not a movie if I had known about I would pay to see in theaters, I'm not even sure at the moment if I want to buy it. (My opinion has nothing to do with the fact that the cowboys are gay... well really bisexual. Just over the movie as a whole.)

Heath Ledger as Ennis gives a performance that is Oscar worthy. Any person with an open mind and sensitive heart will find joy and despair mixed in a film that sets a new standard for movie themes such as this one. Everyone involved with this masterpiece is to be congratulated for giving priority to quality rather than sensationalism.

920,lehdetnet,one of the all time best,10,22 December 2005,"i saw the movie the second time today and it was even better. it is a rare movie, in that it's impact grows bigger after leaving the theater. i just might go and see it one more time ....last movie i saw more than once was titanic which also left me stunned.when reading the reviews on these pages, it is interesting to note how this movie more or less either gets ten stars or one. and the percentages are also interesting, they pretty much match the polls on people's attitudes towards gays. i can imagine what kind of conflict this picture must present to people who's whole life view sees gays as loathsome criminals who should not be. the irony of course is that, that very view is at the root of the tragedy in this film and in thousands or millions of real life stories similar to this one.some people who dislike the film for ""being slow"" might be used to quicker MTV cutting and die hard explosions. some seem to have difficulty reading facial expressions and write that the movie lacks passion or love between the main characters. i and most of the people at both the shows i attended were overwhelmed with emotion. the sounds of people barely containing their sobs was the common reaction. i know some part of the population is autistic. they have difficulty reading faces and body language - and i don't mean this as judgment, only stating a fact - . this movie might not be for those people, so much of it's core is on the actors faces and the most important things are often not said out loud. but for the majority of people who don't suffer from such handicap and who are not so entrenched in their anti gay attitudes that they cannot put them aside for two hours, prepare for an amazing experience.i have now seen the movie 5 times. and i can say that NO movie has had this impacat on me EVER. this is one incredible film. it just stays with you and makes you think and think ... not ONE of the best ..but after a long time of thinking .. THE best movie of all time...honestly",Brokeback Mountain
921,marvin_op,Brokeback easily could be a Shakespearean Tragedy,10,6 January 2006,"I know there are only about 5 basic plots a film/play can assume. Lee proved himself to be among the greatest Directors in America, in deftly maneuvering around a very ""red button issue;"" ""Homosexuality."" The amazing thing is that Ang may have out done the great Bill Shakespeare, although if you actually study the playwright's life you will learn that many of his plays would have tackled the same subject, and did in surreptitious ways, since Victorian English society was not yet advanced or evolved enough to handle this.Emotions run wild in ""Brokeback"" whether one is straight, gay/lesbian, or bisexual. This for all intents and purposes should be a film that unites all of mankind. Sadly with multitudes still on the extreme sociological right-wing, those hoping to bring all of society (not Americans but the world) into one united family will still have some distance to strive.If just 5 to 10% of them realize that a pall of homophobia encases their life, we will be on our way to unity among all persons.",Brokeback Mountain
922,philmphile-1,Age of Innocence (Wharton novel) recycled,4,13 January 2006,"I cannot grasp why film-goers consider BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN genre- breaking except that it's a big budget movie with famous stars. The material just reminded me of other literature (the play THE CHILDREN'S HOUR) and early films (MADCHEN IN UNIFORM) that dealt with gay themes as well or better many decades ago. THE LARAMIE PROJECT (play version) blows this away without even needing landscape cinematography, which Ang Lee deliberately photographs like a Cinemascope western of yore. Sitting through the slowest parts of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN reminded me of Lee's previous ICE STORM, another film greatly overrated whereas his SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, if anything, is under esteemed.Perhaps because I see around six gay-themed films a year, I found the predictable qualities to this period picture harkened back to not other ""buddy movies"" or even westerns (except for the cattle-drives of BIG RIVER), but the unlikely counterpiece of THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, with Ennis substituting for Edith Wharton's Newland Archer in several key ways.The quiet, laid-back, and already engaged Archer fulfills societal expectations, without any ambition to do more than successfully fit it; he never has a creative thought nor a passionate yearning until he meets the Countess; suddenly, his life feels vital but he fears social condemnation so he closets his emotions; he is offered several chances to declare his passion, bow out of his engagement and live with the Countess, but he denies himself the fulfillment of lust. Even at the pathetic close, when both are free, he will not act on his instincts and hook up with the Countess.The parallels lie in the main character, the object of lust (who has a looser past and is quite willing to deny social dictates), the repressive period (whether an limited circle or limitless skyline), the failure to act, and the failure to amount to much otherwise (love goes to no greater sacrifice). The 1990s film of THE AGE OF INNOCENCE miscasts Daniel Day-Lewis as Archer (the guy should appear bland and well-fed) and the gorgeous Michelle P. as a flawed, earthy woman (who should possess a sensual chemistry rather than breath-taking beauty). Just as Jack in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is far more well-traveled than Ennis, Wharton's outsider has traveled extensively. Although Wharton's work circles in a wealthier repressive society, plenty of lovers made choices to live outside that society as the Countess well knows; the impoverished Jack, too, knows alternatives exist, and takes risks in life (the way of the rodeo) and uses charm to gain power and prestige as she did, marrying rich.",Brokeback Mountain
923,xenofil,A story whose time has come,8,19 February 2006,"I felt as soon as I heard about this movie, that its story was a fruit ripe for plucking. I realized that the attraction *between* the rugged, laconic men of the great outdoors, adds fresh life to and a modern perspective, to a genre that many Americans loved for a long time.I am of the baby boomer generation, raised on western TV shows, movies, even radio: from corny or straight-ahead Hop-Along Cassidy, Gene Autrey, the Lone Ranger, Gary Cooper in High Noon, Henry Fonda, Rowdy Yeats of Rawhide, Gunsmoke, Have Gun Will Travel, through more updated ones like Bonanza, Sugarfoot, The Rebel,and hip, wiseacre ones like Maveric, and post-modern ones like Clint Eastwood's spaghetti westerns, I watched them all.I never could stand John Wayne, though, and didn't care much for James Arness. The shoot-em-up at the end was satisfying for a long time, but eventually it started to seem cheap and shallow to me. (Someone bit the dust in almost every one of those shows, five nights a week for ten years or so.) The lonely, laconic, tough, austere, hard-tried man, with a hidden vulnerability or sensitivity revealed only through great crisis: that's what I liked. As I child, I deeply resented it when female characters even made an appearance in those shows, except, perhaps, Miss Kitty, who knew her place and stayed in it.Brokeback Mountain has all those elements in abundance. In feeling, to my definition, it's a classic western, much improved; realistic and believable: dust, hard work, horses, big sky, rugged country, austere morality enforced by threatened violence, and two tough, rugged, self-sufficient, laconic, handsome, suffering guys.",Brokeback Mountain
924,cforartist,The intent of man's heart is evil from childhood on...,4,5 April 2006,"Ang Lee and his Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto deserve the highest accolades for their work in this beautiful film. As do the superb cast. This movie is filled with some of the most breathtaking scenery, and believable (not to mention subtle) performances I have ever seen. However, the major flaw of this film is found in it's Academy Award Winning Screen Play. Larry Mcmurty and Diana Ossana deliver a contrived plot that can only work if you are able to buy into the overbearing agenda-based themes. Consider the scenes with the heroes sheep herding on Brokeback- beautifully filmed and serene. Even given the grueling work that goes into sheep herding, these scenes are constructed with a stress free and relaxed tone. Contrasted against the scenes where the heroes are placed with their families where we never see a glimpse of happiness or relief. To further set the audiences' sentiments towards their agenda, the screenplay never offers a male figure in the film (save the two heroes) that isn't a caricature of homophobic, masculine intolerance. This only furthers the obvious agenda set by the writers when they decided to invert and deconstruct the most recognizable icon of masculinity western culture has ever produced- The Cowboy. Great art has no use for these heavy handed tactics of making certain that the audience is swayed into agreeing with the opinions of the artist. Dead Man Walking is a great example of a film that challenges the audience to think about where they stand after delivering no sympathy whatsoever for the case of its agenda. ""Brokeback Mountain"" wants to paint a sympathetic picture of two people in love that are frustrated at every turn because they aren't allowed to ""follow their heart"". The characters here are believable, yet not in any way are they sympathetic, due to the fact that they are both so insidiously selfish. They are constantly betraying their commitments (even to one another) and destroying the lives of their families in the process- and that is considered a tragedy of romance? Can the heart be trusted in directing us in the way that we should go if it leads to hurting this many people? This was not one of the questions the screen writers were interested in forcing the audience to ask.",Brokeback Mountain

It is the finest movie and the highest expression of the storyteller's skills. There is so much emptiness filled to capacity with nothingness in movies, in literature and in art, but not this masterpiece. This movie exults in the fullness of what art can be. Unsaid, unspoken & uncluttered art, which deftly slices the heart and reveals the hidden agenda of love. It's no accident, but rather genius and compassion merged to create something eternal and plain. I can't resist saying this: It is the greatest love story ever filmed.Can the pain of the heart be loved?

Any arguments against or for will be much appreciated. And if you think that it will snatch a few Oscars, which ones do you think it will be.

I knew Mr. Lee will not disappoint us, yet nobody knows just exactly what the final cut will be like. We waited patiently with some sporadic grapevine news came out from Alberta during the shooting of the film. Then in early September, all of sudden we heard this unbelievable good news from Venice. From that moment on, the anticipation has gone only higher and higher each day. I finally got to see this much waited film a week ago. I was deeply touched (and haunted ever since) by this masterpiece exquisitely crafted by Mr. Lee.I want to thank Ang Lee, the two leading actors and the rest of the cast for giving us such a deep and heart-felt movie so truthfully capture and present the inner feeling of many gay people out there. Back in 1993, Ang Lee gave us 'The Wedding Banquet' to show us the hope and warmth in a wonderful lighthearted comedy set in a Chinese family with a gay son. Today, Mr. Lee gave us the more powerful Brokeback Mountain. I believe Ang's unequivocal altruism as a film director will be deeply appreciated by many through the whole world. Thank you, Ang Lee.

933,steventeen4eva,A 'Mountain' of Achievements,9,23 January 2006,"In a theatrical year full of misconstrued love stories and failed acting attempts (think of the Simpson sisters in the big screen), movies like Brokeback Mountain were somewhat hard to find. And once both audiences and critics found a noteworthy production, it was bound to be a guaranteed phenomenon. Yes, the audiences have had their share of cinematographic masterpieces (Capote, Syriana, The Constant Gardener to name a few). But which movie was able to bring together two teen heartthrobs (Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal), under Ang Lee's direction, in a movie where the plot does not revolve around neither a serial killer nor a school crush?Brokeback Mountain, based on the Annie Proulx novel of the same title, is that one Hollywood movie bound to steal audiences away with its tearjerker plot. Somehow, amidst all the imperfections and chaos and highly controversial subjects, the viewer feels compassion for the lead roles and supports their causes. That is precisely what Brokeback Mountain offers. As far as novels go, Brokeback Mountain is no Memoirs of a Geisha but the other way around seems to work in the benefit of the first, making Brokeback Mountain a winner. And that's the magic formula for this year's movies: Make a huge scene out of a small deal.The story of 'Brokeback' centers on the two main characters: Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal), two cowboys in 1963 who are assigned to work together on Brokeback Mountain, a location which is comfortable enough for the sheep herd they're looking after. After some time, the two engage in sexual activity, which both find enjoyable but brings them to the conclusion that neither is a homosexual. As time passes, the twosome can't believe in failed proclamation and they both choose to continue their relationship as a gay couple in 1960's Wyoming. The story continues to progress as the couple encounters trouble from society and must make very important decisions regarding their living situation.Ang Lee's direction is simply spectacular in 'Brokeback'. Lee does a terrific job in blending emotions with spectacular scenery. The lush backdrop paints a beautiful picture for the audience that's entranced in the story's simple yet nerving plot. Lee will most definitely be nominated for an Oscar, but will probably lose to Oscar-prone actor-turned-director Clooney or the classic Spielberg. Ledger is also likely to get an Oscar nomination, as will the movie for film of the year. As it's pretty clear, Brokeback Mountain is one of the biggest motion pictures of the year, full of critical acclaim. Perhaps the most deserving praise belongs to Michelle Williams, who plays Heath Ledger's wife in Brokeback Mountain. The fact that Williams and Ledger are a real-life couple (with a newborn baby, Matilda) does attribute to Williams' exemplary performance. However, Williams' role was presented with such raw emotion and strong foundation that it almost made her the star of the show, even surpassing Ledger, who could hardly be heard through his gritted-teeth tongue. Doubtless however, 'Brokeback' is still a testosterone-controlled powerhouse production. One of the most amazing components of Brokeback Mountain, aside from the wonderful music, is the fact that all of the main actors are in their 20's and haven't had a wide-ranging portfolio of films. Ledger is mostly recognized for his recent less-than-acceptable films (The Brothers Grimm and Lords of Dogtown) and Hathaway is still mistaken for Princess Mia (her role in Princess Diaries). So by what magic power were these actors transformed into fine thespians, able to portray these amazing roles? Perhaps all the worth is due to the amazing script, or even Ang Lee.Quite simply, 'Brokeback' is one of the finer movies of the year and will continue to sweep some of the biggest awards of the year (think of what happened at the Golden Globes). Although it does not compare to recent classics like Sideways, 'Brokeback' is able to touch a nerve and pose intelligent inquest to the viewer. The movie's delicate subject of homosexuality works to the movie's benefit in Brokeback Mountain, making the movie one of the best of the year.",Brokeback Mountain
934,Velvet_Roses,Surprising !,10,28 January 2006,"I just saw the movie about a week ago and I have just one word to say : ""Splendid!"". Really when I heard about that movie telling the story of two gay cowboys I was curious but never expecting something like this.As everyone knows, Brokeback Mountain tells the story of two young men, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, who meet on Brokeback Mountain during the summer of 1963. We get more and more into the story as their complicity takes a huge place on the screen to finally bloom into a beautiful but really complicated love story.Sincerely, I really wasn't expecting such an awesome performance from Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Heath is incredible when playing drunk, half-sleeping full of desire macho man but also a very disturbed in-love, vulnerable guy. Jake was also very good as the desperate lover who missed his man so much all the time. They also looked like real lovers in the film, which contributed a lot to giving that intense atmosphere to the movie. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway were also very credible as their wives.Ang Lee did a very great job in directing, delivering some extremely intense scenes, such as a ""reunion"" between Jack and Ennis, that ends with a beautiful, intense kiss. I loved the way the film was shot, the location it was shot in, and about everything in the movie.Although this is one of my favorite movies ever, I must admit that it has some weak points, for example some characters just seemed to have no particular reason for being there, as some others just disappear after a while, with no explanation. Also some scenes were just not perfect but come on, nothing really is...;-) There's is also the end that isn't so clear but I think this is better when you have a slight doubt and your own idea of how the story really ends, or the answers to the questions that are not answered in the movie.However, Brokeback Mountain is touching, the actors are quite good, it'll transport you in another world... and you might just not get over it for a couple of days...

By the way, both of those movies are about big, hairy apes that do all sorts of damage.I live in Eugene, Oregon, one of the most liberal places on the face of the earth, and expected to see the theater full of gay guys and ""ultra-libs."" Instead, the audience seemed to be made up almost entirely of middle-aged women, a few husbands, and a handful of college girls, undoubtedly there to see two popular heartthrobs get nakedeven it if was with one another.Here are my impressions. If you have not seen the film and may want to, this may contain ""spoilers""so stop reading.First of all, the highly publicized homosexual sex scenes are quick, not graphic, but still made me squirm. I actually found myself reacting the same way as I do when there is a grizzly murder in a slasher film. I squinted up my eyes, and hunched my shoulders until it was over. I guess I am a full-blown heterosexual.But the movie is way more than that. First, it is beautifully shot (Alberta Canada filling in for what is supposed to be Wyoming)gorgeous scenery, but a stark, and very realistic portrayal of 20th Century cowboy lifeexcept the part about the two cowboys who are hired to tend to a large herd of sheep, high in the mountain, but end up tending one another instead.I have cousins who are 5th generation ranchers there are loads of funny stories about getting lonely on the range, and ""dating"" cows. But none about giving a poke to your fellow cowpoke. There is a reason for that. Cowboys tend to treat homosexuals the same way as they treat coyotes, or a two-headed calf, either as a threat to their livelihood, or an abomination of nature. In either case, there is only way to take care of something like that, make sure it is dead.The movie is sad, there is no doubt about it. However the sadness in my opinion comes not from the end of the seemingly promiscuous and careless life of Jake Gyllenhaal's character, but from the utter destruction of the life of Ledger's character, because of the choices he makes, and his inability to come to grips with the dual nature of his personality.Starting in 1963 and finishing in the mid-70s, there is little doubt that the movie is probably an accurate portrayal of social norms of the era and geographic area. However, with the death of Matthew Shepard in the late 1990's, would make it clear that being ""different"" in many parts of the country, is still not a safe thing to be.The acting is incredible. Both lead men are amazing, as are the roles of both Ledger's wife, and young adult daughter. The pain, attempted tolerance, and unconditional love are heart wrenching.Ultimately, I was saddened by the fact that Ledger's character was unable to put aside a relationship that was so destructive to the rest of his life. He sacrifices the love of his wife and daughters, for the sporadic, occasional meetings with his other true love, Gyllenhaal's character Jack Twist. But there is a huge difference between the two men. While Twist has an insatiable need for multiple sexual encounters, and in the end, is even revealed to have had another long-time male lover, Ledger's character Ennis Del Mar, is ""true blue"" to Jack (when he isn't having sex with an aggressive waitress, or trying to give his wife more babies).It is painful to watch. There is very little about the movie that leaves you feeling good at the end. However, that seems to be the key when it comes to the kinds of films that nominations committees of the various film awards will nominate. Who can actually say that ""Million Dollar Baby"" or ""Monster"" left you feeling anything but sad and depressed. And this movie is in the same category. Great art. Really depressing story.",Brokeback Mountain
938,monilasso-1,It could have been better,4,1 September 2006,"I was rather disappointed about this movie. I had heard so much about it and it left me almost like after I watched Lost in translation! Waiting for something to happen! Maybe I missed the point of it all, again like in LiT, but I thought the characters were poor, boring and the whole movie just slow and not romantic at all! Ennis is so serious and doesn't display any affection for anyone, Jack seems a bit more interested! I thought this was a love story about the two lads but seems more like the just want to shag each other from time to time and I don't see much feelings into it! I was disappointed with the end of the movie too, we don't know if Jack was killed or what really happened to him, and the only sign of love was when Ennis cries at the end looking at the shirt that Jack had kept all those years. I don't know if anyone shares this opinion with me or can explain a bit what I have missed, maybe I should watch it again, as I've only seen it once.",Brokeback Mountain

But I wasn't about to pass up the opportunity to see two of my favorite actors. So I went ahead and rented it. At first it was a little... strange. I wasn't sure I was going to make it through the rest of the movie. But I sat and watched it and I fell in love with Jack and Ennis. Their story is so bittersweet, it just pulls you in and wont let you go. They are so beautiful together and they are so utterly miserable without each other that, by the end of the movie, you want them to be together. The world just doesn't seem right if they aren't When the ""gay cowboy movie"" cliché got to me, I wasn't so sure I wanted to put myself through this movie.

Cried twice, especially in the closing scene. I think it was masterfully handled. I must admit, I was surprised. As I left the theatre I looked at the faces around me. There were loners there, couples, groups. Men, women, young, and old. Actually, I saw a lot of elderly people there. Perhaps it's due to the neighbourhood the cinema is in, or maybe that's just a testimony to how times have changed, and how people can recognise a good film when they see one. The love between Ennis and Jack still resonates. And for a drama, there are quite a number of 'funny' scenes, mainly because everything we see and hear spoken is true, that we know someone just like that, or have reacted the same way ourselves (Jack's Thanksgiving dinner and Lureen's response is a prime example). It is a love story...one that is hard to tell, but that still needs to be told, and thank goodness it was.",Brokeback Mountain
942,john_bonsai,Great...even more great on subsequent viewings,10,16 January 2006,"Ang Lee's destined to be a classic, Brokeback Mountain, will more than likely be the most moving film you will see this year. A sweeping epic love story plays out as a meditation on loss in many respects, and in many ways is a bittersweet experience. An unusual film considering Hollywood and the Networks have taken to ""Disneyfied"" gay characters who break into song and dance at the drop of a hat. Finally we have a tender and heartbreaking portrayal of two, extremely real, characters. The film and the performances are so subtle and underplayed, so much of the dialog being conveyed in unspoken gestures and facial expressions, that subsequent viewings really enable the viewer to ""understand"" many more aspects of this complex story. No big explosions or car chases, but you may still feel as if you've been run over by a truck.",Brokeback Mountain

Its wonderful cinematography artistry, its nuances of emotions and its final shattering revelation of loss and emptiness resonate unceasingly in one's mind long after the ending of the credits. If that is not what constitutes one whoa of a movie then I have certainly missed the boat. Kudos to the remarkable Ang Lee and his brilliant cast for an amazing movie.",Brokeback Mountain
944,jrizzo40,Brokeback Mountain was a great film ... it moved me and turned me on - and I'm a woman!,10,21 December 2005,"The performances were wonderful and authentic, Ang Lee's direction was spare and economical storytelling - just a short moment yields so much info about the people and what happens as time passes. I think the women were finely drawn and their lot in life, being married to men whose hearts were elsewhere, became etched into who they became.I totally disagree with any criticism about it being slow in the beginning or that their life-long love affair seemed unfounded. I felt that by taking the time to show how these two men got under each other's skin and, in a way, complimented the other as a person was absolutely necessary to justify their falling in love & lust. I totally believed the depth of their bond to each other and was extremely moved at the turn of events in their life.While Heath Ledger was magnificent as the closed-off, sad cowboy, it turns out that it is Jake's transformation through the years that stays with me, even days afterward. Both men do a fine job in challenging roles as well as all the supporting actors.I do agree, also, that it will be a hallmark film in that it has redefined man on man love in film as well as expanded the range of the myth of the cowboy in American cinema. I know I will never forget it and it will become part of my image-memory whenever I hear the term cowboy again.And I think this is a good thing. Anytime we can expand the stereotype of any form and explore humanity is, as Martha says, ""a good thing."" I think Brokeback Mountain did more for Kinsey's belief that sexuality is on a continuum and that everyone falls somewhere on that line of being entirely heterosexual and entirely homosexual. Both of these men were bi-sexual as they had sexual relationships with the women in their lives, but I felt that had Ennis never met Jack, he would never has discovered this aspect of himself, whereas Jack seemed experienced to a degree and more adventurous in all things sexual.Enjoy it!",Brokeback Mountain
945,gir2887,Wow. I Get Brokeback Mountain. And I Don't Like It.,3,25 January 2007,"Just to preface this, I'm independent. I don't care about sexuality, and I'd actually like it better if everyone were bi-sexual so politics aren't an issue. There's nothing homophobic about my review, it's completely based on the movie and not the subject content.Okay. So. I watched Brokeback Mountain a few nights ago against my better judgment, because I usually boycott high-acclaim movies that are pretentiously geared towards the dramatically enlightened and sensitive citizens. To me, that's not entertaining. However, curiosity got the best of me and I gave in.Let me go ahead and get this out of the way. The story was good, later on. Not great, just good. And it has Jake Gyllenhaal in it. That is always a plus. Not to mention, Anne Hathaway played a fantastic role and has definitely come along since the Princess Diaries.Now, the bone that I have to pick with this movie. I have never been so utterly bored and uninspired by a movie in all my life. I would honestly rather watch Troll 2 of my own volition than ever have to see this painstaking movie again. Why? A number of reasons.First of all, I have never seen such absolutely direction-less work. It's literally like Ang Lee just gave his actors and cameramen the book and just let them go with it. I mean, was there even an editor hired for this? Did they need one? If it wasn't for the few orchestral spots I honestly would've just given up on waiting for some sort of directional pulse. I mean, where's the vision? Where's the cinematic metaphors for all the intense pain that Ennis and Jack are going through? There're absolutely non-existent.Not to mention, the holes in the storyline are borderline ridiculous. Everything seemed on-par whenever Jack and Ennis were herding in the mountains. OK, Ennis starts taking his clothes off right outside of Jack Twist's peripheral vision to change clothes, and what does Jack, the man who's attracted to him do? Nothing. He stares at a fire. OK, say you're a guy and you're walking down the street, and a good looking woman walks by. If you're attracted, you're going to look. Not only is it logical, it's true chemically. The same goes for women as well. Now, that would have been a nice little hint at the progression that Jack and Ennis were making towards wanting each other, because the moment they do have sex the first time, I felt so lost. It came out of nowhere. There was no hint of sexuality, no gay joke, lisps, anything. Nothing that was filmed showed any real hint of any homosexual tendencies, and then just out of the blue they're having sex with each other. Sure, people know what the movie is about on a rumor basis alone, but that doesn't account for sloppy story and script progression.Oh yeah, did I mention the incredibly predictable ending? Let's just put it this way: in the first hour of the movie, either Jack or Ennis discuss a gay man who was found dead with his face smashed in. Scenes are shown where his face is beaten by a tire-iron. Guess how one of them dies? Sure, you could call it dramatic irony. Or, you could called it unoriginal storytelling.After witnessing one of the most over-hyped movies in the history of moving pictures-nay, since hieroglyphics were the fad, I feel almost mentally destroyed that people defend this slop because its about the struggle of the gay man, and at it's heart a good love story. Look, I'm sure that at it's heart, Troll 2 was supposed to be scary. Was it? No. Why? Horrible direction. Granted, Brokeback Mountain isn't that bad, but it's not exactly a brilliant and stunning movie, either. Movies like this have been coming out for a long, long time. However, for some reason as soon as a movie about two gay guys played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal comes out, it's Oscar time! When it comes down to the bare bones of the matter, Brokeback Mountain is at best a movie that could've been above-average if it wasn't for the completely lifeless and droning atmosphere and progression, and at its heart mainly just another movie for people who really don't know movies.",Brokeback Mountain
946,mdumouch-1,A Beautiful Story of A Simple Love in a Complicated Time,10,18 January 2006,"In Brokeback Mountain, I found myself watching a ""love story"", in every sense of the expression. The sort of plot that will fill the lining of any Julia Roberts or Meg Ryan tale of love lost, found, and perhaps lost again, only to be found once more. As clichéd a story as any film the world might define as a ""chick flick"". However this is not any ordinary ""chick flick"". This is a film that serves a greater purpose. As simple as it is complicated in its idea; how hard is it to love someone, regardless of who they are? Sitting in the theater, I was not fifteen minutes into the film before I saw someone stand up and declare what they were seeing to be ""disgusting"", before walking out of the theater to where I have to believe they demanded their money back. Talk of graphic sex scenes have been blown out of proportion. This is no more than any films traditional unseen ""under the bed-sheet"" intention. It is simply the subject that I believe offends some and changes their perspective.I don't pretend to fully understand the world that was in 1963. However, in today's day and age, to see people walk out of a movie theater in disgust over the idea of two men embracing, I can only imagine the perspective of a world forty years earlier. This is more than Capulet and Montague's familial angst towards one another (Romeo and Juliet), this is an entire civilization that outwardly condemns your feelings to the point of violence.Ang Lee is one of the most versatile and subtle directors I have ever witnessed. His work would not be apparent to most as they sit and watch. There is little expressive cinematic choice. No obtuse camera angles or editing tricks that cry for anyone to say ""great directing"". Lee performs his job in its purest essence, creating a world from start to finish and a vision that cries for your attention.The acting by both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal is superb. They bring those characters to life. There is no doubting the feelings that they have both for each other and towards the world. They support each other equally. I would say that I wouldn't pick anyone else in Hollywood to have played these roles, but I don't know who I could have chosen to begin with.The supporting cast simply cannot stand on screen with the performances of the leads. So much thought has been put into the two lead characters, and they take up so much of the screen time that other characters barely deserve mention. They don't have to. This story is not really about anyone beyond the two men, and in that frame of mind, the film brilliantly succeeds.I have seen few films that may have opened my eyes to a perspective I had not yet seen more than Brokeback Mountain. It is a movie well deserving of praise, both for its story and its message.",Brokeback Mountain
947,d-butler288,"brilliant tragedy, superb acting and directing",9,21 January 2006,"This is one of the most moving experiences for me in a cinema. Ang Lee takes the lid off American life in the 60s (still relevant now) in a gutsy film all round. Despite the windswept landscapes and mountain spectacular we find two young men forced into a life of stagnant conformity breathless in their love for each other. Sacrifice after sacrifice ensues and without overstatement Mr Lee piles on the emotional clout with close-ups of the two handsome actors. Heath Ledger is nothing short of brilliant in a role that demands so much but could easily have gone into the theatrical. This is a performance that I doubt he will ever better. His performance is all extreme passion kept well under the surface. His seething once in a lifetime love for Jack is sadly intense and troubled. This indeed is a performance which deserves the best accolades in the world for an actor on the screen. The success of Mr Ledgers performance depends on the skillful way in which Jake Gylenhaal plays Jack. As a gay man it heartens me to see these two young actors take risks with their careers and this must be regarded as a watershed film in an America where homosexuality is still taboo and getting more so with the religious right stranglehold on morality. This is above all a love story. Ask Jack's mother!! Ang Lee does not drop a beat and he must surely take his place as one of the most gifted directors of human emotion in cinema today. And, rarely in an American film..no happy ending or easy answers. A tragic, beautiful, humane masterpiece.",Brokeback Mountain
948,Sweettina135,"1 hr. 50 mins of Scenery and Silence, 10 mins. of Talking, and 10 mins. of Sex",1,30 January 2006,"This movie was absolutely horrible. The theme was great! Yet, they touched upon a subject without actually grasping it. They needed to go further.Editing and Transitions: These were equally terrible. The movie was slow. I walked out of it believing it was 5 hours long rather than 2 hrs. and 10 mins. Near the end, they included a flashback. Yet, it wasn't clear that it was a flashback. Also, when Ennis and Jack had sex, they were first ""doing it"" and then they were under the covers, fully clothed. There were also pointless scenes that had no meaning in the film; such as, the daughter at the end telling Ennis that she was getting married.Script: The script was weak. There was barely any talking. When Ennis actually did talk, it sounded like a mumble. It took a while to decipher what he was saying. The beginning of the movie was hideous when you sat their waiting for someone to say something...they never spoke. All you saw was Ennis sitting on the steps for 10 minutes while Jack stood by his car. As I said, this movie was really slow. It would be faster watching a turtle crawl.Acting: The actors portrayed their characters well. Except, their wasn't much to portray. The characters were mostly emotionless; even when they showed emotion, it wasn't gripping.Sex Scenes: When they showed the sex scenes between the men and their wives, the boobs being shown were completely unnecessary.Scenery The scenery was beautiful. Yet, it was pointless to show it so much. We knew they were in the mountains, that was clear.Overall, the movie was practically 1 hour and 50 minutes of scenery and silence, 10 minutes of talking and 10 minutes of sex.I give this movie a 1 out of 10.Also, my sister who is very emotional, especially about death, did not shed a single tear when Jack Twist died. She cried more over the dead lamb, which I think was the saddest part of the movie, besides the movie itself.",Brokeback Mountain
949,HellsThorn,"Sadness, met only with the heart",10,20 March 2006,"I just watched this movie for the 5th time, and I'm still feeling the quick stab of guilt. Why must such a beautiful movie end with the saddest ending? God, if I only knew that Ennis and Jack would not end up in the end, when I saw this for the first, that would of saved many tears. This movie is a work of art, and next to maybe Memoirs of a geisha, its the most beautiful movie of last year. No movie will touch your emotions or make you feel like two people were cheated more than Brokeback. Jack loves Ennis deeply, Ennis is afraid to admit his love for Jack till its too late... Jack's piercing forget-me-not eyes, see right through Ennis' rugged image, to find a soft and lonely person, that was depraved of love from his own father. Ennis' eyes show darkness.His eyes are deep, and yet sad. Depression is one of the strongest feelings, everyone has been sad before. This means everyone can relate to this movie, love with stands all other perilous whims in life, except prejudice. Ennis is the most homophobic man to ever be in love with another man. The word ""GAY"" isn't necessary, because Ennis is not Gay, he is confused, and to put him in a clique, is wrong. Ennis never had a smile, till him and Jack bonded. Ennis needed to be held, forever, the animosity of our earth is just too strong for these two doves, the world can't accept them, and that just eats me.",Brokeback Mountain
950,csnider,A Lasting Artistic Testament,10,18 February 2006,"Much has been said about Brokeback Mountain, this long overdue movie exploring the lives and love of characters whose story has not been told before in a major motion picture.For once the hype lives up to the film, and I'm glad both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal have been nominated for academy awards. Their performances are equally well done--beautifully understated with an understanding of their characters and the love they share. And it is not a love based only on sex. The long absences heighten the sex, but the love is based on mutual attraction and compatibility: mutual ways of life, mutual interests, comfort in each other's company,--just as any love is based on these things.Having read the story before I first saw the movie, I knew about the tragic ending. However, the most moving part for me was the climax when Jack tells Ennis they could have had a life together. Because of his lack of self acceptance, Ennis had long ago ruled that life out, and the regret Heath Ledger as Ennis expresses in his final scene is heartbreaking and even more moving the second time I saw the film. I've known too many like him in my own life as a gay man.The picture is directed and filmed beautifully. The gorgeous Wyoming (Canadian) mountain scenery matches the love Jack and Ennis express there, just as Ennis's squalid apartment and trailer match the sad, alternative family life he creates in the one and the barren life his own self denial and timidity create in the other. The symbolism fits. A magnificent movie at every level, a lasting testament to all the artists involved, from Annie Proulx, Diana Ossana, Larry McMurtry, and Ang Lee to everyone else, including Rufus Wainwright, the openly gay singer on the soundtrack.Brokeback Mountain deserves all the awards it has won and all the Academy Award nominations it has received.",Brokeback Mountain
951,rominaki1,Such a low-costing production and such a masterpiece at the same time...,10,4 March 2006,"I watched ""Brokeback Mountain"" (which, in Greece, has been translated as ""The Secret of Brokeback Mountain"")yesterday evening, having been impatiently waiting for that moment since it was released here in Greece 2 weeks ago (on February 16th). I had great expectations of this movie because I am a cinema-lover and appreciate really good films, regardless of their production cost or their roots (Hollywood). I dare say they were not just fulfilled, but the film overcame all my predictions. As soon as it ended, I realised that chills had been running down my spine and I felt that (although being a male, I am both sensitive and open-minded, don't mind to confess it)I would burst in tears, but unfortunately I didn't. Crying would have helped me to relax, but instead I have been feeling like a knot has been stuck in my throat all day. Never before has a film affected my feelings so much. I just can't take it out of my mind. I would love to become a hero in the movie, a friend of jack and Ennis who would understand and support them, who would urge them to live their love without compromising to the conservative standards of the society they lived in. I am thinking of watching it again at the cinema and of course I will purchase the DVD as soon as it is released.What I most liked in the movie was its pure simplicity. Everything was pictured with such a realism! The screenplay, without containing any spiritual, exorbitant phrases, managed to convince and capture me from the first quarter. Here's a spot that I can recall: (Jack)""Tell you what. The truth is...Sometimes I miss you so much that I can hardly stand it"". So simple. So honest. So immediate. So convincing. The cast was just stunning. Pure, sensible, mature performances, actors respectful to the story, the director, the audience and above all themselves. Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway and the rest of the supporting cast were born for their roles. Just born for them. The score was also delightful. Gentle melodies, simple but heart-breaking and connected to the film, having the necessary pessimistic tone that also existed throughout the whole film. And finally, I should mention something about the love scenes. Nobody can deny that they were an indispensable part of the story which could not have been put aside. i was impressed by the passion, the intension of the atmosphere during the scenes when the heros were kissing or having sex, so I think that these scenes were also just perfect. Generally, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is one of the most powerful and heart-breaking love stories I have ever seen on the screen. The ending, which captured me, could not have been different: only tragic. But that;s what makes this relationship between Ennis and Jack unique (and of course, that's what makes the film a masterpiece): the fact that, fro the beginning, it was sentenced. Thank you, all of you who have worked for this movie, for offering us a film to remember. 10/10",Brokeback Mountain
952,ricmalic,A very powerful film,10,28 February 2006,"Like Ennis and Jack, Brokeback Mountain got me good. I don't remember a recent film where I forgot the leads were actors playing roles. All of them have major emotional scenes and some have more than one. How often does that occur in a film? Not often. Unlike some of the other reviewers on this site I never checked my watch even once during the several times I saw the film. With advance apologies if I belabor the obvious or inadvertently include ""spoilers"", here's what I think.Though Ennis and Jack are gay this is not the reputed ""gay cowboy"" film that has generated so much hype. Rather its a human story about love, loss, the choices we make, and the choices that are made for us. These dictate our lives, and it doesn't mean that we live happily ever after because of them. This goes for Ennis's and Jack's wives as much as for Ennis and Jack themselves. I drew a parallel between this film and Casablanca. Both films have love, loss, and choice. The difference for me is that in Casablanca the choices that were made felt right. In Brokeback Mountain that's not the case and that's the tragedy. You feel that Ennis and Jack should have been together. Given the 1963 Wyoming time frame it would have been dangerous for them and heartbreaking for their families. Even as things actually turned out there was heartbreak aplenty to go around.A couple of striking things about the film 1. Lust vs. Love. What began as lust wound up as love. Initially Jack wanted Ennis more than Ennis wanted Jack. The first tent scene had a good deal of lust in it. The much more important tent scene was the second one,where Ennis took the initiative to come to Jack. I thought it was a marvelous character touch that he came in tentatively, holding his hat between him and Jack as some sort of barrier that Jack has to (and does)remove. That's the beginning of the love story, and it lasts over the years of ""fishing"" trips. And remember that the tender second flashback scene, though it occurs late in the film, chronologically occurred in 1963 and forms part of Jack's acute sense of loss.2. The Ending. Though the circumstances are tragic, I felt that the ""epilogue"" left some room for hope. Ennis's question to his daughter (""This Curt fellow, he loves you?"") indicated he has been able to process his own loss and hold on to the emotion so apparent in the shirt scene. Its even more apparent when he says he will give up his job to attend her wedding--something he was never able to do with Jack, to Jack's desolation. And what exactly did Ennis want to swear to Jack? Leaving this unsaid and up to the viewer was a wonderful ending.3. The Acting. The most expressive eyes and non verbal acting I've seen in a long time. My very favorite (though by no means the most powerful) is Heath Ledger's ""guilty child"" look (complete with gnawing finger) when Ennis tells Jack at the last minute that he can't make August. 4. Review comments about the story being and ""old"" one. Yes it is--as old as human nature.5. I did not find Ennis's mumbling to be the problem others did. He's SUPPOSED to be that way--repressed and inarticulate. Its a part of his character and how he grew up.6. My favorite (most moving) scenes: the second tent scene; the meeting after Ennis's divorce; the final meeting between Ennis and Jack; Ennis's phone conversation with Lureen; Ennis's visit to Jack's boyhood home; and finally Ennis's conversation with his daughter and his last words.This film deserves all the awards it has already won and may yet win. It is an incredibly well written, acted, poignant, and heartbreaking film (and I didn't even mention the cinematography, which is awesome). Kudos all around to Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway, and Director Ang Lee. Don't let the ""gay/gay cowboy"" label intimidate. If Monster didn't turn you into a mass murderer, chances are Brokeback Mountain won't make you gay. There's MUCH more to this film than that.",Brokeback Mountain

But I went in to this movie not realizing how profound and amazing this movie truly is. After the first half hour you feel completely at ease about this movie and you are successfully sucked in to the storyline and the love between these two men. Ang Lee really made this movie a picture of accuracy and real world situations that documents how being a gay man, especially a cowboy, is not socially acceptable and how this effected the two main characters of this movie. The story is touching, moving, upsetting, and exciting all at the same time and the movie was beautifully shot, put together, soundtrack is amazing, actors took my breath away with their amazing abilities.

Just like Ang's previous work in 'eat drink man woman', the movie stayed away from many opportunities where it could milk the audience for their tears and emotion. There was no big explosive melodramatic scene, especially towards the end where the movie could easily have done so. I've read the short stories, read the reviews, and seen the previews prior to the movie. So there was definitely certain expectations, like how and what I expected to see in the next scene or so. Having said so, there were still a few surprises here and there that really captured the moment for me. The cinematography was breathtaking. And the score, it was beautiful and very effectively integrated into the movie, especially in the quiet moments.So now, after 24 hours seeing the movie, I couldn't help but hearing the score and seeing imagery from certain scenes. I started to understand the choices made by some of the characters. And there are certain images that will haunt you like the dripping sound of water. It's a simple story with a complex characters, you don't have to be gay to relate to the characters; ultimately, it is a story about lost love and identity. See it with an open mind, and I'm sure you'll come out with a bigger heart.",Brokeback Mountain
955,Brocky,Deserves any award it is nominated for,10,5 February 2006,"We went to see this beautiful movie in our local theater, as we did not have time to watch it in San Francisco earlier last month. We were surprised, though, to learn that it only ran in on theater there. Expectations were high, as we had heard a lot about it, but they were met fully, if not more. What blew me away completely, was the scene with Roberta Maxwell and Peter McRobbie. I completely relived a visit with the parents of a friend of mine from military. This scene, as this movie in general, is a masterpiece in how much can be said and expressed in so few and well picked words. Actually, the most emotional scenes hardly have any lines at all.",Brokeback Mountain

As for the film itself, I think the hype about it somewhat weakened it for me - I wish I had seen it without knowing anything about it, or expecting it to be a groundbreaking masterpiece or something. Also, the sound is a little muffled which, given the way Ennis speaks, like his mouth is wired shut, makes it hard to understand some of his dialog.",Brokeback Mountain

I hope that it will win Best Picture at the Oscars, it excites me that we're finally embracing diversity in humanity. there are SO many(too many) of us, why should we expect to be all the same? this movie is a fantastic study of human nature, the whole spectrum is here, from love to hate, from humor to despair. i can't wait to see it again.",Brokeback Mountain

I only had one thought.. the movie was 45 min too long. As the next day rolled along.. I found myself thinking more and more about the film and how it affected me. As it turns out.. it's really a great film.. just a bit too deliberately paced.. and uninterestingly edited.The two boys are phenomenal.. but their 20 year aging is unconvincing.. the facial hair is not very well made and it's far too obvious where the aging makeup ends and their actual youthful skin begins. However.. despite it's shortcomings.. Brokeback mountain is a remarkable achievement.. both in story and acting. Heath Leger proves here that he has the chops to actually carry a movie.. and Jake Gyllanhaal is once again a wonderful actor, building on his roles where he was already impressive.",Brokeback Mountain
959,bernerlove,Loved this movie,9,15 January 2006,"This film has some excellent acting by Heath Ledger, in particular.I've been to Wyoming...twice.. and he acts just like a Wyoming ranch hand....silent, serious, kind of mumbling when he responds to you.The story of this impossible love between these two young men is one that could really happen. There are men who can not live with being attracted to another man.Yet, they have to keep it a secret. It will torment them as Ennis was tormented by it. Men who would certainly not want it to get out...for fear of reprisals from society.Heath's performance has already won him some acting awards. I hope it brings an Oscar to him. His acting is from the gut. You can feel the ache in his soul.The film also has spectacular scenery thanks to the cinematographer. Just beautiful. I see it was filmed in Alberta, Canada...but believe me it looks like the area in northern Wyoming. A beauty that hits your soul and stays with you. Like the scenery..this film will stay with you a long time.

960,BAMPCS,"Forbidden love, rehashed again",5,6 May 2006,"I almost think I have to apologize for not liking this movie as much as the apparent majority on IMDb. Usually when a film generates the controversy that Brokeback did, I want to see it and usually ""get"" what the fuss is all about. Not this time. Yes, it is beautifully photographed. But the places chosen (Wyoming, Alberta) are inherently so beautiful to begin with, even I could have made a great looking film. Yes, you have two men whose love affair is forbidden by their very culture, but how many forbidden love plots can we have? The plot was not that extraordinary, you had to know one or both were going to die before the end of the movie. And guessing that it would be Jack Twist was fairly easy since he had the more ""dangerous"" behavior to begin with. I will give Heath Ledger credit, he certainly capture the quiet dignity of the cowboy breed and was able to combine it with the torture he felt with his sexuality and his loves. The squinty stare, the confident gait, he really got the true presence of who a cowboy is. Jake Gyllenhaal, on the other hand, seemed like a frat boy out of his element. I just could not buy into his character. I usually am s blubbering sobbing idiot with a death in a love relationship type of movie, gay, straight or otherwise. This one just didn't do it. I applaud Ang Lee, producers and writers of the film for their mature and thoughtful treatment of the subject, but it just wasn't that good.",Brokeback Mountain

Living in a small town in Texas, I went to a neighboring community to see it. Wouldn't want to get labeled, would we? That is part of what I really see this movie is about: labels and communication.The script is excellent, the actors (especially when young) are attractive, and the supporting roles are strong. The music is expressive of the subject as well...this movie would not have worked with an expansive orchestral score.Communication breaks down on various levels in this movie...the protagonists lie to themselves and to their respective wives and families; the wives lie to themselves and to their husbands. When the truth does finally come out as it always does everyone is hurt. It is true to life in ways that not many other films are.",Brokeback Mountain
962,thompoe,Add to the Canon of Great American Films,10,3 December 2005,"With so many excellent and insightful comments regarding ""Brokeback Mountain,"" I feel no need to say a lot about the film's plot, acting, etc., except to say that having been fortunate enough to see an early press-screening of Ang Lee's film -- five days later, I remain emotionally devastated. One of the songs written for the movie is titled ""A Love that Will Never Grow Old,"" and for many, many film goers, this is a film that will ""never grow old."" As the Chair of the Film Studies program at the University of Missouri- Kansas City, I teach a course titled ""The Silver Screen and the American Dream"" which regularly enrolls well over 300 ""Red State"" students. In that class we screen and study the ""canon"" of great American films that most show the power of film to impact the ever changing meaning of the ""The American Dream"" -- Chaplin's ""Modern Times,"" ""Casablanca,"" ""Citizen Kane,"" ""The Searchers,"" ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, "" on to ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" ""Easy Rider,"" ""Midnight Cowboy,"" ""The Godfather,"" etc. -- but the difficulty of finding post-1970s Hollywood films worthy of being included in this ""canon"" has proved to be depressingly obvious.Suddenly, unexpectedly, out-of-nowhere, Ang Lee has given us the first film of the 21st Century to join the ""canon"" of GREAT American films that will be watched and beloved for decades to come. Like the truly 'canonical' American films of the past, ""Brokeback Mountain"" will be hitting new generations of film lovers in the gut and the heart in 2050 and 2100, as much as it does in 2005. In this cynical age when our best film directors seem content to give us ""postmodern deconstructions"" of past Hollywood genres, that Ang Lee gives us a film so pure and direct in its emotional power -- with (to use Fassbinder's phrase) the ""direct tenderness"" of the films of Douglas Sirk -- and even more, to bring Sirk's ""direct tenderness"" into a rapprochement with the great, masculine Westerns of Ford and Hawks. That is what I call a a mind-blowing, gut-wrenching, heartbreaking, film-making miracle. Some great films can ""blow one's mind,"" othes can ""get you in the gut;"" others can ""break one's heart."" Very few hit you in the brain, gut, and heart with one blow. The last 20-minutes of ""Brokeback Mountain"" delivers a K.O. to the brain, the gut, and the heart in one swift hit.",Brokeback Mountain
963,Swish8,Wow - Brokeback is Worth All the Hype,10,15 April 2006,"I finally got around to seeing Brokeback Mountain and all I can say is ""Wow"". Finally a movie with a good story and good characters. I was glad to see a movie with gay characters that finally aren't stereotypically gay. You get so tired of seeing movies that address homosexuality in which the key gay characters fill every stereotype out there. This was a movie about two men in which gay was just something they were, not something they were trying to be or trying to flaunt. Heath Ledger's character was everything a rough, ass-kicking, whiskey drinking, heavy smoking cowboy is except he happened to be seceretly in love with a man. The acting was superb. Everyone on the cast filled their role to a T no matter how big or small. Randy Quaid as the Wyatt Earp style rancher, Anne Hathaway as the Texas lady with big hair and big ""balls"". Michelle Williams did an awesome job and Jake Gyllanhaal gave an excellent performance playing his multi-faceted Jack Twist who dared to possibly have the life that he truly wanted. One of my favorite scenes involving his character was the one in which he finally stands up to his father in law.This movie handled many themes, dealing with bigotry, and the different levels of love. Heath Ledger should have won Best Actor. Every part of his character from the protective father (the scene where he beats up the foul mouthed men at the 4th of July celebration), to the manly husband,to the gruff cowboy, to the love that shines through when he is with Jack, to the hurt, confused, and angry soul that he is through most of the story. Each level of his character shines through in Ledger's performance. This movie has all the makings of a classic Drama/Tragedy. The dynamic between the two main characters is so moving as well as their interactions with the other characters.My only tiny criticism would be that they should have done more to make the characters look aged over time. It takes place over the course of 20 years and the only thing they do to really age the characters is give Jake Gyllenhaal a moustache and Anne Hathaway big puffy hair. But other than that, this was a great film. This movie really deserved the hype it got. Hats off to Ang Lee for finally presenting us with a beautiful story that wraps you up from beginning to end. And not only that but finding a unique story to adapt to film rather than re-hashing old material as is a trend these days.",Brokeback Mountain
964,caitfecto,I can't stop thinking about it!,9,15 April 2006,"Brokeback Mountain was unbelievable. Gyllenhaal and Ledger were great actors and they are so cute! The story was very touching. I didn't know how I'd react to the sexual scenes with two guys but I found myself interested because they were truly in love. It was beautifully put together. It was a little long but luckily it was very good so it kept my attention. If you're a person that loves heartwarming tales and passionate love stories, then this is for you. It's amazing! I can't forget this movie ever! I'm emotionally attached to the characters and I feel as if I know them and I was with them through the movie. It was directed well and the scenes on the mountain were breathe taking. It's a must see!",Brokeback Mountain
965,munkymaze,Over-rated,3,30 April 2006,"This film was, indeed, as someone else has commented previously here, Over-Rated. I went to see it in the cinema with some friends for his birthday. I thought it was an alright film, but it really had no real story. It was two gay cowboys that loved each other. One comes to visit the other 20 years later, after the visited guy has had children! The girl is swinging on the swing and sees the other gay man walk past and the film is just generally weird from my point of view. And the last line of the film, I didn't hear, the accents were maybe too strong or something?? The only thing I liked was some of the music. That song Wings by Gustavo Santallola (i think that's correct spelling).",Brokeback Mountain
966,reidel-1,What was all the fuss about?,5,21 October 2006,"I finally got around watching this movie . A lot has been said about it, all superlative, and all sounded like this would be a real treat. I must mention that I delayed seeing it because I saw some spoofs like ""Brokeback to the Future"" and others on the internet and whenever I heard snippets of the Brokeback Mountain sound track I was reminded about cleverly edited scenes between Ernie and Bert or Frodo and Sam. So I started watching expecting to be drawn into a love story where the emotion is felt beyond the screen, where I would be completely drawn in by the fate of the two protagonists and I waited and waited and waited until the end when I nearly did cry but not because I felt for Ennis but because I was so bored. I found the story incredibly shallow and smothered with clichés. The main characters were boring and why did they have to be inaudible. Sorry, I forgot, Cowboys mumble. The women where mere caricatures with the exception of Ennis' wife. Jake's parents, Jake's in-laws... please. This is not a good movie like ""Far from Heaven"" which also deals with homosexuality and other taboos during almost the same era, but does so with much more depth. I am glad this film did not get the Oskar for best picture.",Brokeback Mountain
967,watergarden,"Beautifully crafted, poignant drama",10,7 August 2006,"Brokeback Mountain is a beautifully crafted, poignant drama. It has a strong, uncomplicated, unsentimental story line with rural settings and themes. According to Annie Proulx, the author of the short story upon which the movie is based, the overriding theme is destructive rural homophobia.I put Brokeback Mountain into a very special class of movies that I call simplistic yet powerful rural dramas: The Last Picture Show, What's Eating Gilbert Grape?, and The Trip to Bountiful. The specific plots have little in common, of course, but each has characters whose actions are dictated by values of a changing rural society within a given time frame. All of these movies have realistic dialog within an uncomplicated story line, are well acted and directed, and have affected me deeply. They are movies I watch again and again.The main characters of Brokeback Mountain are young, poor Wyoming ranch hands named Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist. During summer 1963 while working on the mountain, isolated and carefree from the rest of the world, they become good friends and eventually fall in love with each other. Once they come down from the mountain, they are confronted with a rural society that shuns such a relationship. They go separate ways, find wives, and have children. They meet again and struggle to keep their love alive. Their decisions, or lack of them, to circumvent the perceived wrath of society, affect not only themselves but their families, the results of which constitute the remaining dramatic action of the movie. Seemingly ordinary conversations and often subtle interaction among characters carry the movie along. Although the action may seem slow at first, you must remain observant or you will miss the nuances, the clandestine glances, and the caring smiles that foreshadow a growing intimacy. The pace quickens after they come down from the mountain, but nothing is superfluous; each new scene and character provides more insight into Jack and Ennis and works to move the plot toward the climax. I attribute the effective transition to Ang Lee, the director.The major actors (Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams, and Anne Hathaway) are very convincing and have received much praise for their contributions to the movie's critical success. Also very impressive are the actors in the minor roles. Linda Cardellini, Kate Mara. Roberta Maxwell, and Peter McRobbie have very few lines apiece but deliver them effectively and allow us to embrace four well rounded characters.Brokeback Mountain touches upon many other themes: true love, regret, masculinity, infidelity, repression, denial, loneliness, family relationships, and sexual orientation. Gorgeous mountains, impoverished small towns, and lonely ranches serve as backdrops. The movie has much to offer.It is, however, NOT an easy movie to digest. You have to think about it, internalize it, and maybe see it more than once. I have already seen it many times and I like it better each time. I always see something new in the acting or the depiction of a scene.It is not an action movie. It is a drama. It is poignant as well as a beautiful work of art. If you let yourself become involved in its story, Brokeback Mountain will deeply affect you.",Brokeback Mountain

Although I really liked it, I was expecting so much more or something else and so i was a little let down. The perforamcnes were great especially from the women and i thought Jake G. did a really good job even though Heath got all the attention. One good thing was how full the theater was with all types of different people and I'm glad that people can be open minded enough to enjoy a story even though it is about people who have a different lifestyle. this is the kind of movie that I will have to watch over again once the hype has died down and i am sure that I will like it a lot more.",Brokeback Mountain

Only because it was shot it in such a wonderful location (Wyoming) did it earn another point. Otherwise, this is easily recognizable trash for the feeble minded. Character development rivals that of Ang's other films... THE HULK jumps to mind. (I liked the bottom left frame of The Hulk the best- but I haven't watched the three others yet). Otherwise, I believe many females are 'haunted' by the thought- this could happen to their man! As for the 1500 or so 'haunted' male reviewers... can you guess who they 'are'? I believe 'Jay and Silent Bob' have a scene or two dedicated to them. As a straight male, I found the movie ANYTHING but haunting. Boring? Yes. Lacking Dialogue? Yes. These long silent, loving moments give us time to be... Haunted? The bottom line (no pun intended) is that this director doesn't speak English, and has resorted to the 'haunting silence of love' to make a big budget movie that caters to a specific audience that hasn't been fed in a decade or more (we miss Harry Hamlin?) Good thing Jason (Holloween fame) didn't like boys... all these reviewers would have to find a new adjective. Gaysmerizing should do it.",Brokeback Mountain

Not because both lovers are men, but because their story is so full of life and longing, and true romance. Very genuine and it happened to many men today.Dilemma faced by two cowboys, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist. Ennis and Jack, love each other passionately. Yet they can't live together in the Marlboro Country of the 1960s and 1970s, so they try to hide their love behind their heterosexual domesticity. It is also the love itself, which at first seems baffling to these two manly men, as if it were a thing apart, rather than the force that gives meaning to their lives. So begins a sporadic and tormented affair in which the two meet once or twice a year for fishing trips on which no fish are caught. Jack urges that they forsake their marriages and set up a ranch together. But Ennis, haunted by a childhood memory of his father taking him to see the damaged body of a rancher, tortured and beaten to death with a tire iron for living with another man, is immobilized by fear and shame.What was not really elaborate was the death of Jack. The wife said he had a flat tire and basically it was an accident but the visual showed that he was beaten to death, the cause, I can't really figure it out. May be you know ...",Brokeback Mountain
971,hutuanga,We do exist!,10,3 July 2006,"It took a while before I was able to see this movie as I live in a remote area in Australia and I only go to the city once a year. Apart from what I thought was great acting by all of the characters, the film really hit the spot with me because finally there is a film which portrays homosexual men who live in the bush. It's a good feeling to be acknowledged! I never got married myself, but during my life I have 'lost' a few partners who I loved very deeply. Just like Ennis the prospect of them being found out was just too overwhelming and they got married. One of my friends committed suicide because he was unable to cope with the denigration of being a known homosexual within a bigoted community.The cinemas in the town nearest to me refused to screen Brokeback Mountain, I suppose they just didn't want to accept the fact that yes there are gay cowboys hidden amongst us.So I'd like to thank everyone who was involved in getting that story out into the mainstream, it's going to make it just a little easier for the thousands of rural and outback men like myself to accept and feel proud to be who we are.

I just now watched this movie after reading so many excellent reviews. I knew this movie was going to be an epic like all the comments said, but I really didn't know how powerfully it was going to change my life. Ennis and Jack are two characters who are so uniquely distinct that they fall into a strange and powerful, bonding love. Because of society's non-acceptance, many characters are emotionally wounded from this romance. I can't stop from going over every little detail, from beans to ""Jack, I swear..."" The ending is unforgettable. Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger along with the rest of the magnificent cast transform what would normally be a film into reality. ""Brokeback Mountain,"" is like how a good poem should be. It doesn't just pretend to be the words on the page, but is the words on the page. This film is the love and freedom on Brokeback Mountain.

976,brianskirk,A Transcendent Love Story,10,17 December 2005,"Setting aside for the moment that ""Brokeback Mountain"" deals with two gay men, it is first and foremost a love story, told with a very narrow focus on two men and then to a lesser degree the people who populate their very small worlds. The film is beautifully shot, takes its time to build character and plot, and leaves you with a haunting feeling that we must grab every opportunity in life to be who we truly are.Those who struggle or are bothered by the sexuality of the film are of course saying more about their own sexual hang-ups than they are about the quality of the film. In a very real way, I don't think the film is too interested in whether or not these two men are gay (though they are). It is concerned with the way they develop a deep bond of love but live in a culture that refuses to allow them to fully respond to that connection. So the two men do exactly what society asks of them --they put aside the feelings, repress them, bottle them up and behave themselves by getting married and having children. Of course, this doesn't quench their connection and only brings heartache to their wives and families.I'm not certain how one could see the final moments of this film and not recognize it for a profound depiction of human connection that transcends culture/time/politics. The last shot of the film is haunting...Clearly, this film has hit a nerve with movie-going public. It is a love story in a way we have not seen before and the fact that it is generating so much ""talk"" is a tribute to the fine work of art that it is.",Brokeback Mountain

Never have I seen such true love; never have I so forgotten the fiction in the motion picture before me. Never will I scope life as monotony, and view same-sex marriage as the same.

978,evolutionseeker,Quietly Pwerful,8,16 January 2006,Brokeback has minor flaws which can be easily over looked once you are in the story. The beginning is slow and it is about 20 minutes to long. The chemistry between the cast is intense enough to jump off the screen and Michelle Williams is flawless in her performance. The setting of Wyoming is beautiful and the emotional complexities happening in everyones world pulls you in like an unstoppable magnet. I admire any actor who takes a risk to play a character that may be out of his/her comfort zone and both Jake and Heath are as real as Charlize Theron was in Monstor. Ang Lee always has a way of being quietly powerful in his direction. I don't think Brokeback Mountain is just a gay cowboy movie.

It tells of that one thing we want more than anything yet simple cannot attain. There is not one person that cannot relate to this film in one way or another. It reveals emotion after emotion that we feel and know in every way. Such raw emotion is shown from Gyllenhaal, Williams. Hathaway, and others. Yet this is Ledger's film. His performance is so incredibly powerful and can move any lover of romance. Ledger captivates the audience and leaves us craving more of his painfully real character.

980,gabogallardo_92,THE Most Overrated Movie Of The XXIst Century,1,19 April 2008,"First of all, I have nothing against homosexual people, I have a few gay friends myself; however, the first ""love"" scene the two main characters have was just plain disgusting. That wasn't love it was plain rape-like sex, there wasn't any kissing, touching it was just take your pants off and bend down.Could this movie have any more plot holes? For example: 1. They have sex one night, then they beat each other up a few days later. After the fight they don't see each other for four years, Jack visits Ennis after all this time and all-of-a-sudden they are in love and they can't live without each other.2. Why did Ennis kiss Jack (literally) in front of his wife, couldn't he just shake his hand and wait until they got to a motel and then kiss him as much as he wanted? What is the need to shatter his wives heart like that? 3. How the hell did Ennis know Jack hired male-prostitutes just because Jack said he went to Mexico? What? Is Mexico supposed to be male-prostitute heaven? You go to Mexico only when you want to hire male prostitutes? Screw that, I think the idea people have that Mexico is a criminal country and nothing more should change.4. Jack dies and what is Ennis's reaction......... Nothing... He finds out he's dead and calls Jack's parents, not a single tear for the love of his live.5. If Ennis is so concerned about leaving his family why doesn't he even make an effort to demonstrate his love for them? There isn't a single scene in the movie in which you can actually say: ""that is the perfect example of a family man."" 6. The characters are just hate-able. I smiled when Jack died and Ennis is just indifferent to me.Don't watch this movie, you just waste 2 hours, 20 minutes of your life.

The only weird thing i wanted to say is that something happened to me that never happened before while watching a movie... During the actual screening i was not totally convinced and sometimes even a bit annoyed / bored... its just an hour or so after i left the cinema that the full drama and impact and beauty and emotion of the film hit me... leaving me with a weird feeling in my stomach that still didn't really go away... Its really weird, this ""retro-active"" emotional bang that i got... I really cant wait to go and see it again in theater on Monday... (something else i NEVER have done before)... and watching the message board on here it seems I'm not the only one (people who got it in the shower, the next morning in bed, at work, watching trailer again...) its so weird... and this never happened to me before... But well... thats all i kinda wanted to say, and of course, if you hadn't get the point yet by all the other comments, great movie must see... especially to enjoy the ubersexy Jake Gyllenhaal !!!!

982,avanttothefuture,"offensive, overlong and heterosexual",1,15 September 2009,"two cowboys meet, fall in lust, marry and continue their relationship behind their wife's backs, mope about...That's about it for this film. I know other people may claim it's a great love story but, frankly, there allot better ones out there and there's decidedly more Queer ones too. This film concerns the relationship between two bisexual cowboys who are (alas!) torn apart and eventually destroyed because of their love. Well isn't that an example of Heterosexual Cinema's love affair with the suffering homosexual? Everything is present and correct for a Homophobic representation of Queer Men: the disgust at their sexuality, the pain and suffering and one is even killed by the end of the film (one is reminded of the convention of the Queer dieing in the last reel.) A step forward? A Gay classic? No, just another Heterosexual movie, just another violence visited on the metaphorical (and, within the frame of the movie, actual) flesh of Queer people, just another white Heterosexual Liberal movie for white Heterosexual Liberals.On a formal level the film is well shot but overlong. Given it's excessive running time the film can't even manage any real character development: the lead characters go round in circles and the female characters are thin and unconvincing.1 out of 10 and that's just because there's a pretty mountain in the opening scene.",Brokeback Mountain

Anyone agree.First off - I need a BBM Support Group...""Hi my name is Chris and I have recently been crushed by BBM"" "" Hi, Chris!"" Secondly, TWO words...Amazingly Devastating.I am a mess 12 hours later! Beautifully directed, acted and written. It hit too close to home. Finally there is a mainstream movie about a tragic gay love affair. Unlike a Philadelphia or Boys Don't Cry, this movie is about two people in love - and every encounter is heartbreakingly unsatisfying as they must always go their separate ways. I knew the plot and how it would pan out, what I didn't know...is how much it would haunt me - I may have stayed away if I had.My only beef - why does it have to take two straight men to show the world that gays love like everyone else...it kind of pisses me off in a way - like - oh yeah - be straight - play gay - and get an Oscar...wow, is that how tragic the world views us? Lastly, Beware - see this at your own risk - you may get broken yourself.PS - I was only one of like 5 gay guys in a sold out theater - shows that the movie's silver lining is to be thankful you are a gay American in 2005 and not 1965.",Brokeback Mountain

It's been a long time.""Brokeback Mountain"" is the most remarkable film I have ever experienced. It reaches into your heart and deep down into your gut and pulls out those feelings that we try most of our lives to suppress. Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar and Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist bring to life two beautiful characters who turn their lives upside down trying to deal with their love for each other.

One should also allow themselves to comprehend the message of what forms a true and pure human connection can take.This is what Brokeback Mountain is about.Suffice it to say that I had to share the impact I felt with this film in some forum. It's that important and special.Everyone should encourage his or her family and friends to see the film.I believe it is going to be an important milestone in film and culture in this century.",Brokeback Mountain
986,dan_quiterio,Good--Definitely Not Great,6,16 January 2006,"It's true that the photography was gorgeous and the film is deserving of a Best Cinematography nomination, but not for writing or best picture (which I'm sure it will).I read the novella, which is only 50 pages long, so that's the first indication that the film was unnecessarily too long at 134 minutes. Although adaptations don't have to be true to their original source, for the most part, this one was, and yet it still ran too long.I felt that the entire second act dragged on too long with absolutely no conflict. It was like watching Ennis's life, then watching Jack's life--skip ahead a few years--watching Ennis's life, then watching Jack's life--skip ahead a few years--watching Ennis's life, then watching Jack's life--skip ahead a few years (and so on and so on and so on). It was basically watching people breathe for an entire hour. Yes, they did have internal conflicts, but it was the SAME conflict (i.e. they want to be together but external factors prevented it) for an hour. Yes, their love was timeless, but did we really need to see them almost EVERY YEAR OF THEIR LIVES? It's not like there was a change of heart or anything on either guy's part. If the theme is that this love was timeless, then show them at a couple stages of their lives, not all of them.This film is getting so much press because of the story and its ""controversy,"" but any story about homosexuality can be deemed controversial--and yet Kissing Jessica Stein or the dozens of other similarly-themed films don't get nearly as much press and most definitely no nominations.Anyway, I apologize for this tirade but the hype this film is getting really burns me up. It was good, but not nearly as great as people make it out to be. I think people are afraid to dislike it because they think they might be deemed homophobic.",Brokeback Mountain
987,segustafson,Unbelievably bad,1,24 April 2006,"Is Hollywood kidding? Is this what the movie industry and the pseudo-intellectuals are offering the viewing public today? Is everyone so determined to fit the ""politically correct"" jigsaw concerning homosexual acceptance that our society is pushing today that we would accept this blather as art? Many aspects of this movie were painfully numbing: 1. Pacing. This was one of the most painfully slowly paced movies that I have ever seen. Nothing of any great import happened for a good 20-30 minutes, unless you enjoy watching sheep herding, horse sitting, camp sitting, etc.. The rest of the movie was no better. Most of this could have been condensed into a 1-1/2 hour movie or less.2. Acting. Heather Ledger needs lessons in diction. There were times (and there were many) where I had to strain and replay just to understand what he was saying. I suppose that limited facial expressions and monotone delivery of lines mean restrained acting today, but many times I thought he was falling asleep. Jake Gyllenhaal was no better, with his constant puppy-eyed looks and dog-erred smiles. The only actor who showed any spark was Randy Quaid, who unfortunately was not in the movie often enough.3. Love scenes. The first came out of nowhere, and left me wondering ""did I miss something, or is this just lust....and a way to market this movie"". This was supposed to be some amazing love story, full of thunder and passion, a love story for all, gay or straight, but all I saw were 2 guys ""getting it on"" or what I would call gratuitous sex. The only passion I saw was at the end, when Heather Ledger's character realizes his loss. If this movie was full of passion, I certainly didn't see it.4. Hype. I have seldom viewed a movie with so much unbelievable hype, only to discover that the end product could never live up to it. Definitely not Oscar material.There were, however, a few aspects of this film do deserve attention.1. Cinematography. This cinematography was beautifully mastered, from the sweeping vistas of Wyoming to the fireworks scene at the park. Flawlessly done.2. Scenery. I never realized that Wyoming could be so beautiful, even in winter. The mountains and valleys were glorious to the point that they overpowered the movie itself, which considering wasn't such a bad thing.If you strive to be ""politically correct"" or enjoy enduring over 2 hours of boredom, watch this film. Otherwise, don't waste your time.",Brokeback Mountain
988,copperhed80,Don't believe the hype...,1,7 February 2006,"After all the glowing reviews I'd heard I went into this film expecting a lot, and came out woefully disappointed. I honestly can't remember the last time I felt so disappointed by a film, and for all the reasons it seems to be getting great reviews. I really like Ang Lee's previous works, and was very excited at the idea of seeing Heath Ledger get to stretch his legs a bit in a bigger role than some of his previous ones. I've really liked his earlier films, and even Jake Gyllenhaal I think is a brilliant actor. So how they managed to make this film with the ingredients they had is beyond me. It is poorly done, the acting which is getting such glowing praise is bad, and the characters really unbelievable. I spent the first 20 minutes of the film giving them the benefit of the doubt, hoping they would find a rhythm that they never did. I'm not going to give anything away, but the story line that is suppose to be about 'love' is anything but. If anything this is a story about lust, and feels very much like the characters were plugged in to a setting and story that the makers knew nothing about. I would recommend that you see for yourself to understand how far from the mark this film seems to be, but that would mean I would be recommending you waste the money you'd spend to see it, and that's a fiver I really wish I could get back.",Brokeback Mountain
989,kcgulley,I love this movie,10,16 March 2011,"This is movie is amazing!!!! Jake Gyllenol was absolutely incredible... I was a little weary at first watching it but after the romantic scene in the the tent with Jake and Ledger i was automatically hooked. The passion they showed in every love scene was amazing. They were free spirits who were longing for something more. They were 2 misunderstood cowboys who shared a bond like no other. The end was terrific but what can I say the whole movie was freaking' awesome. They definitely did whatever it took to make them happy and thats all that matters. I definitely think that it should have ended with Heith Ledger meeting with The ROCK!!! this movie would have been the greatest of all time which it almost is but I'd have to give that title to the Scorpion King because it actually has the Rock. This movie is grade A could have used more romantic scenes with Gylenol and Ledger. I really wished i could have seen a three man love triangle with Gyllenhaul, Ledger, and The Rock. Them 3 in a tent together all curdled up. Can you say one happy guy that lives in Weiner, Arkansas by the name of Kenton Cooper.",Brokeback Mountain
990,JesseXXX,One of the best movies of the year,10,23 September 2005,"I saw BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN at the Venice Film Festival. I saw it twice. The first time was actually the world premiere and Anne Hathaway, Ang Lee, Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger were there in the screening room too. It was very special and emotional watch such a wonderful, moving and powerful movie and had the chance to show all your gratitude to its makers. The response of the audience at the end of the screening was really warm and sincere. Anne Hathaway was crying herself. The movie is really really a good piece of cinema. I can watch now the trailer and a lot of emotions come back to my memories. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal did a good job but the real great material was from the female supporting cast, Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway and Linda Cardellini. Especially Michelle Williams, she was really really extraordinary. Anne Hathaway was exceptional too, even if her role is less emotional than Williams'. She gave the best at her last scene at the phone, however. The screenplay and the direction are so wonderful just because they seem so pure and sincere. The story of a really powerful and painful love. The sensational score by Gustavo Santaolalla is really a big part of the movie's soul. When the screen faded to black and the wonderful score filled the screening room, my God, it was really intense moment. I won't never forget it. Thanks again, to all the people involved in the movie. THANK YOU",Brokeback Mountain
991,martypres,What a gift from Ang Lee,10,25 January 2006,"There is almost nothing I can add to the many wonderful reviews on this site. But I had to add mine in the hope that getting it out of my mind and into the computer will put me at rest. Well, I can hope.As most everyone knows, this movie unfolds a tale of two lonely cowboys, Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal), who, surprisingly to them, fall in love one summer while they are tending sheep on Brokeback Mountain. The strength of their feeling for each other must be denied verbally but explodes physically, with Ennis retching out his guts as he walks away from Jack at the end of the summer. Right here you begin to feel the depth that this movie touches in the viewer as your heart cringes at the scene. Nothing is said, but the picture shows you everything. Ennis, being a rough and tough cowboy, refuses to acknowledge or accept his ""forbidden"" love for Jack.To say that the reunion of Ennnis and Jack four years later is of a ""long lost love,"" does not do justice to the strength of the feelings that overtake the men when they see each other again. This scene shakes the viewer on two levels. One is the perfect performances of Heath and Jake as they clutch and kiss. The other is the reaction of Michelle Williams as Ennis' wife, Alma, who catches her husband in the arms of another man. This is the scene that foretells the rest of the movie: You know that Ennis and Jack will be soul mates forever, whether they are together or not, and you know that their marriages, their attempts to conform to social mores, are essentially over.It is this constant jerking of the heart, between the all-consuming love of Jack and Ennis and the feeling of the doomed nature of that love, that keeps you riveted in your seat, that brings all the emotions of the ups and downs of your own life into play. While you may not recognize the exact story, you do know exactly what the emotions are and they can be devastating to you.This is also exactly what makes this movie a work of art. Who has not, at least once, heard a piece of music or seen a theater performance that evoked such feelings? When a work of art is able to bring the viewer into the experience the artist is trying to express, that's when you know it has accomplished its purpose.One of the songs in the movie, ""A Love That Will Never Grow Old"" won a Golden Globe award and reflects one of the major themes in the movie. The movie won three other Golden Globes as well, because it speaks to so many of us on so many different levels.It addresses the homophobia of our times, both externally and internally.It reaches into the hearts and minds of millions of men (and women) who have experienced the same forces in their lives--their personal expression of love versus society's views of love.All of us have regrets, deep ones, ones we'd rather forget, that are being resurfaced because of this movie.As Ang Lee says, ""The story is both unique and universal."" That's the magic he has concocted for us in this beautiful, unforgettable, wrenching film.As Jake Gyllenhaal says, ""I think if we'd known the kind of reaction we would get, we could never have made the film."" And it's precisely because of these two statements that the film has come together as a miraculous piece of art. Because it is unique and universal, the audience ranges from teenagers to older folks. Because no one knew how it would be received, everyone involved in the production was able to give the story the very tender care and attention that it needed without concerning themselves with the outcome. Lee said the set became very quiet during the filming of one of the last scenes, and he turned around to see everyone, cast and crew, crying; a demonstration of the effect of the integrity with which this film was created.This movie has touched my mind and heart in many ways: the capacity of our brothers on the planet to create great beauty using simple, yet powerful, ideas; the importance of being open and accepting in all areas of our lives; the need for courage to be as truthful as we can without endangering others; and the necessity of the presence of love in our lives in order to experience the truth of it. All this through a heart-breaking story of pain and loss.As far as I am concerned, I'll take that kind of experience over other types of ""entertainment"" any day. I can truthfully say that no other movie has affected me in the manner this one has. Thanks to one and all connected with it.",Brokeback Mountain
992,tedcoconut,Not a movie about gay cowboys,10,12 December 2005,"I'm not very eloquent and I don't know anything about ""film"" but here goes: I wasn't expecting this movie to live up to the hype but I thought it would be nice to relax and watch the scenery and the good-looking actors. But I left the theater 3 hours ago and I can't stop thinking about that movie, I want to go see it again tomorrow except I don't know if I can take the emotional strain of it two days in a row. Don't think this is a movie about ""gay cowboys are people too,"" but more about the fugacity of happiness and the evanescence of life. It's corny but it reminded me of the song ""Time in a Bottle,"" especially the part about ""But there never seems to be enough time/To do the things you want to do/Once you find them,"" and it seems like, we should realize that this is universal. Ah well, I don't know what I'm talking about but this was one of those rare movies that really deeply affected me.And the acting was magnificent.

993,anonymous_whisper,Hit me like a ton of bricks,10,18 February 2006,"This movie impacted me in such a strong way. I saw it a week ago and am still thinking about it. First off, the performances are amazing. Jake Gyllenhaal, Heath Ledger, Michelle Williams, and Anne Hathaway bring such depth to the characters in such a remarkable way, even more remarkable considering how young they all are. The characters feel real, never forced. Heath Ledger in particular gives a gut-wrenching performance and he without a doubt deserves the award for Best Actor. Ennis Del Mar is a character I will never forget, Heath so brilliantly brought him to life. The cinematography is beautiful. Wonderful writing. Ang Lee is a genius. I wish I could more eloquently write how much this film means to me, but I'm not that articulate. It is a modern masterpiece and if you love great film you have to see this one.10 out of 10",Brokeback Mountain
994,NetherStowey,"Punches thrown, punches pulled",5,3 January 2006,"To tell the truth I expected more and got a lot less. Not a great love story from any pov. The movie, like its prairie backdrop reminded me of that old joke where two cowpokes lean over a broken fence: ""Sure looks like someone cut a hole in that fence alright. Sure looks like someone cut a hole in that fence alright. Sure looks like someone cut a hole in that fence alright."" And so on into the night. The film dragged until the last 20 minutes or so when the emotional heat was finally turned up from medium to high. Not enough to save an otherwise dull film. I also think that the filmmaker pulled his punches when dealing with the gay bashing theme. It was very lightly touched upon and aside from the one graphic flashback was given short shrift dramatically, particularly at the end. I'm sure this was a case of treading lightly so as not to alienate even more viewers who might already be put off by the gay theme. A shame really because that's where the real guts and pain of the story lay. A play it safe film that gives us two not very interesting characters who while married with children fall in love and suffer the consequences -- mildly. I think Ang Lee gave us a more compelling love story in ""Sense and Sensibility"" and that's saying something given Austen's proclivity for repressed emotions and characters who are never able to say what they truly mean or feel. I confess to feeling more sympathy for Leger's betrayed wife than for the two cowboys in love.",Brokeback Mountain
995,ibizahound,A masterpiece!,10,26 January 2006,"A beautifully nuanced examination of true and honest love. Ang Lee, in what I believe to be his finest work to date, delivers the tragic tale of crossed lovers in a haunting, tortured and stark Eastern narrative set to an idyllic Western, both literal and hemispherical, theme. Every moment of this intensely personal story resonates long after the final, quietly gut-wrenching scene. Lush and atmospheric both visually as well as through a wonderfully understated score by Gustavo Santaolalla, Lee takes us on a journey of, on one hand, self-discovery and, unfortunately on the other, self-denial. Amazing and powerful performances by all the principle actors render these characters someone we've known or someone we've been. Jack Twist and Ennis del Mar. You and me. This film will not be easily forgotten by anyone who believes that through experience or compassion there is true love to be found. Or even stumbled across. And sometimes it's not wrapped in any preconceived packaging but possibly even a little rough around the edges, ultimately delivering the one-two punch of pure, devastating love. By far my vote for Best. Period",Brokeback Mountain
996,milo_494,"Great, great movie",10,5 February 2006,"What a fantastic movie. It was years since I saw such a powerful drama, and the acting is outstanding, who would have thought that Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal had such depth in their acting abilitys. I was a bit sceptical when I heard that Ang Lee was supposed to do the direction, but as it showed, I don't think anyone could have done it better. The whole story is so delicately done, without disturbing melodrama. The tone is restrained and subtle, which in the context makes perfect sense. To see Heath Ledgers character, Ennis, struggle with himself is immensely disturbing and sad, and the contrasts between the two are very powerful for the narrative. Also the scenery, with the raw nature at, for example, the Brokeback Mountain adds some interesting imaginative symbolism.",Brokeback Mountain

998,wireflight,Mountainous Failure Breaks Back,2,23 December 2006,"Brokeback Mountain (""BM"")'s initials pretty much sum this movie: it fails as a comedy, it fails as a tragedy, it fails as a manifesto. In fact, I can't remember any other movie having so thoroughly disappointed me.To wit, the only people to whom I can imagine BM appealing are those wanting to see nudity from Anne and Michelle, each of whom flashes her breasts at the camera for maybe 1-2 seconds: for the hardcore perv, it's definitely worth a rental, because the women in the movie are stunningly attractive. Similarly, some people ""get off"" on seeing women smoke; it's a turn-off for me, and it ruined the fantasy I had for Anne.The movie in a nutshell: Having hitched a ride with a trucker, Ennis walks to the parking lot in which arrives by an old pickup Jack. Jack long ogles Ennis in (Jack's) driver's side mirror. Joe hires the 2 strangers when they don't balk at the queer terms of employment.Ennis first mans the base camp; after a few days, he swaps with Jack. With the aid of free-flowing liquor, Jack wears down the conversationally-reluctant Ennis, and we learn the back stories for these men (""dad hated me""). Ennis stays too long at the base camp one evening, and tries to sleep outside. The weather turns foul (cold, windy), and minutes later, Ennis is buggering Jack in the main tent.While that progression might work fine in porn, it destroys the film's credibility: snuggling afterwards, Ennis declares to Jack, ""I ain't queer;"" Jack responds, ""Me neither."" This apparently happens within the first 14 days after Ennis and Jack first meet. The sexual liaisons cease for a few days, but the men find sex with each other an irresistible and ever-present temptation.Although such risky behavior is contrary to the respective natures of Ennis & Jack, they regularly frolic in outdoor homobliss; disapproving Joe discretely watches, then uses a storm threat as excuse to end the grazing season on BM a month early. Although Joe didn't fire Ennis & Jack, he doesn't re-hire them.Ennis marries Alma and they have 3 daughters before Jack postcards Ennis, who replies to Jack's question with ""You Bet."" Meanwhile, Jack met affluent Lureen, married and had a child. Ennis stays home all day desperately anxious to meet Jack; Alma sees the men passionately kiss and is disturbed. Ennis & Jack apparently go directly to a motel, where they ""lie with each other"" overnight.When Ennis returns to Alma, he announces an impromptu 3-day, ""Ennis & Jack only"" fishing trip; Ennis & Jack go to a place that looks identical to where they'd earlier played on BM. Given the obvious hazards that presented, it's yet another implausible happenstance.Years pass; as often as they are both able, Ennis & Jack continue their stud/f-buddy relationship. Ennis has no passion for Alma, but has obviously much for Jack. Alma tries with a note to remind Ennis to return with some of the fish to his family (he says he caught a lot, but ate them); when it seems obvious Ennis never opened his tackle box, she breaks down and Alma & Ennis divorce.Having discovered his own arena of business competence (sales, perhaps management), Jack is now a man of means. Jack has made the connection between risk and success. Unfortunately for him, Jack has neither the acumen of old money, the sophistication to appreciate the perils awaiting him, nor the wisdom to abandon foolish pursuits (Ennis).During the intervening years, Jack -- unabashedly in love with Ennis -- reveals to Ennis a plan to allow Ennis & Jack to live together apart from the hassles of heterosexual life: basically, it is a ranching scheme capitalizing on Jack's family property. Jake seeks the warm weather (and perhaps the remoteness) of Mexico, and urges Ennis to ""get on-board"" -- but Ennis refuses to abandon the familiar, frigid north.Ennis pusillanimously blames his aversion to risk on age, on the notion he can't quit a job in order to go to work in a startup business, on the idea he has child support payments to make, etc. At the climax of their lover's spat, Ennis blames Jack for (Ennis's) confusion regarding (Ennis's) own sexual orientation.Ennis's postcard to Jack is returned with ""DECEASED"" stamped on it. Ennis learns from Lureen that Jack drowned in his own blood as the result of a tire-changing accident (Lureen's audio account is dubbed over video of ""morals posse"" apparently bludgeoning Jack to death). Lureen is apathetic, suggesting she may have been involved.Some reviewers mention the book indicates Lureen's account was faithful, and that the video merely revealed Ennis's imaginary interpretation of Lureen's words (based on Ennis's earlier account of the torture-killing of a homosexual male, the aftermath of which Ennis as a child was forced by Ennis's father to view).Regarding the details of Jack's demise, which account the film intended to portray as accurate was not readily apparent. If the video was merely Ennis's imagination, then so might have been the apparent apathy in Lureen's voice.Overwrought Ennis visits Jack's parents' home, where he learns Jack was apparently always homosexual. Ennis retrieves a shirt presumably stolen from Ennis by Jack as a keepsake commemorating their first union; Jack's parents let him keep it.Ennis's daughter gets married; Ennis is reluctant to attend wedding, but relents. Life goes on.During our respective lifespans, each of us at some point encounters at least most (if not all) of the dysfunctions presented in this film -- and we each perhaps encounter a number of other dysfunctions.It is remotely conceivable that such shallow characters as these exist in real life; however, I found relationship to them impossible because I did not find the characters credible.",Brokeback Mountain
999,lakenyc,I swear???,10,30 December 2005,"What is Ennis saying at the end when he says, ""Jack, I swear?"" I give this movie a 10 by the way. What a powerhouse. An astonishing film.I'm not sure I've ever seen a film that showed 2 MASCULINE gay guys. Most of the time, Hollywood portrays gays in a non-threatening to straights way. Look at Will and Grace. What an INSULT. The one time I saw a masculine guy on Will and Grace (Bobby Cannavale, the cop) the writers had to ruin it by having him be so stereotypically gay. There was an episode where he said he was suspended from the force because he stopped to go shopping during a major assignment. WHAT AN OUTRAGE to degrade like that. I just can't watch Will and Grace; it outrages me. Jack is such a caricature. NO gay person is as flaming and nelly as he. And Will is not very masculine. And Hollywood sells that show as hetero on one level: Will and GRACE. They lack the BALLS to portray Will and BOB.Brokeback Mountain might change things. It is the first time I've ever seen this. It's never been done before. What a movie!Let's hope for gay people everywhere that this will signal a change in Hollywood.

1000,coreyj72,A stunningly shot and well performed portrait of love across the years.,8,4 February 2006,"ANG LEE's Brokeback Mountain (cited constantly as the ""gay cowboy movie"" by journos, critics and people who haven't seen the film) is a haunting and wind swept story of forbidden love.The film's protagonists meet and fall in love, but can not be together for various reasons. They happen to be sheep herders / cowboys of the same gender, but could just have easily been a white girl and a black boy in 60's America, or any two married people  a point seemingly missed on the ""bible-bashers"".A shoe-in for Best Cinematography and Best Supporting Actor, Brokeback Mountain uses the performances of its two leads and the rugged beauty of its setting to ""rope"" viewers in and tug at their heart strings like a lasso.I was not one of those disappointed by Ang Lee's Hulk (where his use of split-screen was refreshing and faithful to its comic source), but this is far superior and close to his ""Crouching Tiger"" masterpiece.",Brokeback Mountain

We had very little indication that this was anything more than a casual relationship.The first time that I felt any emotion for any of the characters came toward the end when Ennis visits Jack's parents. In a very subtle way we understand what they are feeling. This happens again when Ennis visits with his daughter at the end. Too little, too late.I just can't imagine the wild praise for this movie. The only thing I can think is that people are getting lost in the praise and are afraid to admit they didn't care for a movie that featured a gay relationship.",Brokeback Mountain
1002,licheng_huang,It hits the bottom of your heart,10,10 January 2006,"Being a movie which is rated R in States and having a controversial theme which talks about unrecognised love in most of countries worldwide, Brokeback Mountain does make itself extraordinary like the weather Ennis and Jack had in Brokeback Mountain. Ang Lee is a director who pays a lot of attention to details, not only the soundtrack of the music but the details of the emotional and verbal part of the movie. The movie starts with the word 'sh*t' (UK version, sound excluded), ended with 'Jack, I swear...'. The montage at the last meet of Ennis and Jack makes all the past twenty years even miserable. How could they love each other so much that they could stand the same mountain and activities only 2-3 times a year? Yet it's not only about the forbidden love (used-to-be). In 'Friends', that Ross married a lesbian is a sense of humor. Here, when we saw what happened to Alma when she discovered and how she tried to rescue their marriage. It's such a miserable thing to admit that we have to live under the masks.The scenes shoot at Brokeback are incredibly beautiful and the whole cast is quite successful especially with the couple Heath and Michelle. It gets more intense in the later half of the movie since you know the reality is always worse than our thoughts. It is a sad love story with a powerful ending. Everything stops there at the right time to hit the bottom of your heart without touching it. You'd cry aloud but couldn't do so because you are trapped into the deep thoughts about your own life/relationship or whatever. Will you keep your commitment? Time will tell. One of greatest love movies in the last ten years. One of the best gay love stories has ever been told on screen. It is a movie you shouldn't miss if you accept the diversity of the society.",Brokeback Mountain
1003,nkarani,"I saw the two Oscar favorites, and my own vote goes to Crash.",7,7 March 2006,"Brokeback Mountain, in spite of being a gay-themed film, did not move me the way Crash does.I can think of several possible reasons for this--other than the intrinsic merits of these films. In random order: The accents (I think I did not understand one-third of the dialogue) in BM, its slow pace, and the fact that I have seen enough closeted men up-close so that I look at most of them with a clinical detachment.Crash is also a tension-filled drama compared to BM's dry love story. The former leaves you with some hope, while BM leaves me, as a gay man, neither seething with anger at the homophobia (too subtle) nor does it make me cry buckets. I am not a fan of violence in film but here it was too fleeting to either hurt or outrage me (the way I was outraged by the violation of a woman's body in Crash). I would instead prefer the docu on the Matthew Shepard case (The Laramie Project).To me Crash is not just about racial prejudice but also a comment on America's gun culture. I have no knowledge about the situation in the States, but I know that enough discrimination exists on the individual level and there is enough violence involving guns to make them alive issues--they may disappear from the public radar but they do not go away. BM's flag for the gay issue is too underplayed for my liking.",Brokeback Mountain
1004,gggim25,One of the best movies of all time.,10,1 January 2006,"I wasn't intent on seeing this film, a friend and I decided to see it upon nothing else being available.Wow. I can compare this one only with a select few...The Color Purple, To Kill a Mockingbird, Titanic, Love Story, A.I. Only rarely does such a story and film come along that wrenches the heart into a lifeless dead piece of flesh. I actually had trouble walking out of the theater. Kudos to all who saw this one to the screen, it is a monumental achievement, to say the least.This is not a gay cowboy movie. This is a love story that deserved to be told.",Brokeback Mountain
1005,catfish907,"Sorry I didn't like it. Oh and don't use the ""homophobia"" card on me!",2,14 November 2012,"Sorry. I don't like this film. I hate the fact that anybody who criticizes this film is labeled a ""homphobe"". For the record a few of my friends are gay and they HATE this film to! My issues with the film. The acting:I couldn't understand a thing Heath Ledger was saying. He mumbled. Jake Gyllenhaal was rather weak. The best performances came from Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams. They were one of the few redeeming parts of this film The ""sex"" scenes: Sorry,during the tent sex scene it looked like rape. It didn't look consensual at all. It was basically how yaoi/slash fangirls imagine gay sex to be like. Is Hollywood trying send the message that all gay sex is rape? The ""love"": Jack and Ennis were not in love, but in lust. All they seemed to do was want to screw. There is more to love then just sex. Also they secretly cheat on their wives to go mess around on Brokeback mountain. Basically the film is saying that gay men are liars that cheat on their wives to go bang each other. Totally not helping the issue of gay rights. The plot: Sorry the plot never held my interest. It was rather boring. Also they never seemed to age after 20 years. It was as though their bodies were frozen in time. Also if they couldn't admit they were gay because of the homophobia in the rural west, then why didn't they just move somewhere that is more gay friendly like,oh I don't know...San Francisco? In conclusion: Brokeback Mountain does not deserve the praise it gets. If it were about a man and woman and not two guys, it wouldn't be as popular as it is now and would have been sent to the trash bin of movie history. Where it belongs. Brokeback Mountain does not help gay rights,but rather hurts it by portraying gays as liars that cheat on their wives and only care about sex. The only reason I gave this film a 2 instead of 1 was because Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams did a good job and the cinematography was good. Criticizing Brokeback Mountain does not make you homophobic. It just means that you can see through the veil of the hype and see the film as it actually is.",Brokeback Mountain
1006,sartoris99,Brokeback is Groundbreaking,10,17 December 2005,"I am ruthlessly critical of movies about gay men that fail to render us in complete creative ways. This is especially true about movies written by heterosexuals starring heterosexual actors. So take it seriously when I say that I believe Brokeback Mountain is, surprisingly the most complex, nuanced, and intelligent representation of gay masculinity yet delivered by the film industry. Heath Ledger got the Golden Gloe nomination, but my favorite is Jake Gyllenhall who deserves an Oscar for his intensely sensitive, genuine portrayal of the hopeful Jack Twist. Gyllenhall communicates Twist's sexy, seductive optimism without reducing him to a lustful nit-wit. The film is excellent at showing us things rather than beating us over the head with sensitive dialog. Gyllenhall's motto should be the famous lines uttered by Norma Desomond in Sunset Boulevard: ""We didn't need voices we had face."" Norma was bemoaning the rise of the talkies, but Gyllenhall should be celebrated for his ability to show the face of exhilarating love and absolute, existential disappointment in quick succession.The characters are conflicted about the pressures of the world they live in, but confident in their love for one another. The tension this produces is simultaneously inspiring and heartbreaking. The film is smartly literary, but as a Ph.D. in English I only started mulling the allusions and metaphors after I left the theater, so I conclude that it is rich with meaning, without beating you over the head with its own cleverness.",Brokeback Mountain

1008,higrace,Good Wake Up Call (spoiler),8,5 January 2006,"They say doubt is sometimes good. It makes you question the path you are going, maybe it's the wrong way? when Jack blames Ennis for what they have now, ""nothing but Brokeback Mountain,"" meeting only once in a while as they keep a secretive long distance relationship, it reminded me of my own situation. Although my mom knows about me, her forgetfulness factor is way up there. I'm running out of reasons for her to give to her friends about why I'm going to drive down there again. I liked this movie because it showed what it really must've been like for a gay cowboy in the mid-west way back then. Hopefully it will show ""the closeted"" today what a truly long way we've come for them to continue to hide in there.",Brokeback Mountain
1009,DanKIT21,Nice Try Hollywood,4,21 July 2006,"Although I did not enjoy this movie and don't plan on seeing it again, I do give Hollywood credit for attempting to expose the venomous, intolerant nature of our culture when it comes to issues such as homosexuality. That being said, I think Brokeback Mountain won all those awards because of the controversial, ""daring"" subject matter, not the quality of the film.The first 20 mins. or so, I was completely bored and tempted to turn it off, but since I had already paid $3.99 to watch it on On Demand, I felt compelled to see it to the end. I was kinda thinking ""Okay, great is this entire movie going to be about two gay guys on a mountain""? It isn't until they get married that the movie starts to get remotely interesting.I noticed that other IMDb users have commented that the acting was horrible and the slurred speech made the male lovers sound retarded. I also found it difficult to understand half of the movie due to the poor dictation; however, since the characters are impoverished and uneducated I think the slurred speech was part of the character and is actually a sign of good acting. Given the script and plot that the actors were given to work with, I think they did a brilliant job, but the Best Director and Best Actor Oscars should have gone to Walk The Line! One last thought.. I didn't really see how the two men fall in love.... I mean what did they find attractive about each other? Aside from the scenes where they make love, they never actually say anything that reveals what they admire or respect about each other.",Brokeback Mountain
1010,hanne_lore,and I swore I wouldn't cry,10,8 February 2006,"Can't believe how affecting this movie is. I saw it last night with friends and for the first time in years I nearly skipped work to head straight back for a second look I don't really see it as being about a gay relationship as much as it is about forbidden love (think Romeo & Juliet; Heloise & Abelard etc) and the power and tragedy of this sort of epic passion. The fact that they're gay in Wyoming just makes it more believable that they could be separated by circumstance. I found it deeply moving, beautifully filmed and with extraordinary acting. Calling it the gay cowboy film just seems to be such a glib trivialisation of a heartbreakingly human story. Who could be more deserving of the Oscar than Heath (just a little more than Jake)! Better still: could they be jointly nominated???How could anyone resist the emotional impact of this film?(PS haven't cried in a movie since age 10, but couldn't stop the tears last night.)",Brokeback Mountain
1011,Bobbyjames184,Brokeback Mountain,10,4 January 2006,"The printed story is just as compelling as the movie. Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar, two cowboys portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger in the film. I personally think it's going to be an American Classic and anyone who disagrees should just notice the awards this movie has already garnered. The only problem is that it isn't available everywhere in every theater. The plot, is nicely done to flow with Annie Proulx's story. The acting is wonderfully done by Gyllenhaal and Ledger and the themes, music, and ideas are simply splendid. I think this movie goes to show the struggles faced by two people in love and I honestly think that people still conceal their relationships for the pleasure of society. Sadly though, Jack's death comes when he is apart from Ennis and that wouldn't have been the case had society not been how it is still today. I think Ang Lee and all of the cast and crew should feel exceptionally well for creating such a powerful and emotional film. And with any luck, more and more people will see this movie and hopefully everyone who lives like Ennis and Jack will soon be able to do so without the constant judgment from society. I give this movie 5 stars and a 10/10 rating. It's simply the best movie I've ever seen and I hope that it wins every award it's nominated for, from here on out.",Brokeback Mountain

I think when a piece of art is exceptional you just know it without having to explain why.To say that the setting, the actors, the soundtrack and the story are exceptional should be enough. But this movie reaches down inside of the viewer and evokes him to want more for the characters and even from ones own self.The theme in this movie transcends a simple gay relationship story and expands to greater universal themes of love and the confines of society. One can sympathize with the characters as they grapple with the reality of the world around them while struggling with the conflicting forces within themselves.",Brokeback Mountain

I'd been wanting to see it for an extremely long time, but it either wasn't in my area or no one would go and see it with me. I have to say that the film was brilliant. Jake portrayed someone that was truly in love, and you could see it in his eyes. I understand why Ennis didn't want to risk living with Jack, but I kept hoping that he'd cave and be with the person that he loved so. My friends didn't want to see it, because they don't like gay people. I don't care who you are, a love story is a love story. It's been 2 days since I've seen the film, and i still can't get it out of my head. This was a fantastic film, and Ang Lee did a beautiful job, and so did the cast. I hope that this film wins Best picture! I do have to say that I was shocked when Jack died. I don't understand why the original writer would have her strongest character die like that, but nevertheless, it was a great film. One that I will see several more times and purchase once it comes out.",Brokeback Mountain
1014,kvissa,Feeling a little let down,6,21 July 2006,"I just finished watching Brokeback Mountain and I gotta say that I feel a little let down. I feel like the guy who is the only one who doesn't get a joke when everyone around is laughing their behinds off! But seriously,I don't see how this movie can get a rating of 8 (7.9/10) here on IMDb. I had read a lot of reviews on this site prior to watching this movie and guess I had very high expectations. I am also mature enough to rubbish all the 'gay' themed comments/reviews. I knew this movie would be beyond just sexual relations between two cowboys. I guess I was expecting a lot more answers. Answers as to why Ennis was fighting to reveal himself, or why Jack didn't try harder or ***SPOILER WARNING*** why we never truly know how Jack died. I feel this whole movie was about restraint. Everyone had something to say but they never could. It is very frustrating! I guess I am the kind of person that is expecting those answers at the end of the movie..at least to some extent. I must say that all the actors in the movie did a splendid job. Heath Ledger was outstanding! What got to me the most in this movie was the soundtrack. Gustavo Santaolalla's music is so beautiful and simple yet haunting. He has a style all his own. The cinematography was amazing too! It kept distracting me throughout this movie. I was more in awe of the majestic mountains than the main characters or their story. All in all I am a little disappointed. Thought this could have been so much better. But there you have it, one among a million that didn't find this movie as great as it's been made out to be.",Brokeback Mountain

It is a very moving story about a love that cannot be mentioned. Some points were really emotional and moving. I was shocked at Anne Hathaway. What a way to get rid of her Princess Diaries reputation then to be a hardened Texas witch. Same with Michelle Williams. She was so good I expect an Oscar nod. If Heath Leadger doesn't get one, I'm gonna be upset. He carried the entire weight of the movie on his shoulders and pulled it off great. You felt for him, you laughed with him and you cried with him. Yes the movie did drive me to tears. I can't wait to see it again!!",Brokeback Mountain
1016,samrim-1,"""single moment of artless,charmed happiness'",10,13 April 2006,"Another Google Alert this evening led me to an 'Apple' trailer for ole Brokeback, and watching it again, I was moved to hot tears, as it was reminding me vividly of my last visit to the cinema to see it all.Reiterating all the superlatives applied to the film seems like 'gilding the lily' to me, sufficient to say that all the hundreds of reports and comments I've read, praising everything about the film, the story, the direction, the music and the acting, and all the rest, I support from my heart. Instead, may I offer some random thoughts on this unique cinema experience!So many memories.; the way Ennis rides a horse, like a centaur; and his warm, loving smile for Jack after they had separated the two flocks of sheep; the hot embrace after four years apart, and Jack, night watching the sheep under a white moon. Alma storming off 'all shoulders' for the extra shift after their shouting match; Ennis' obvious love for his little girls; and the two guys in the tent on the second night, with Jack waiting almost religiously, and Ennis like a young groom on his wedding night going so uncertainly to his beloved. Somebody else wrote that they 'had never seen gay sex seem so 'manly'', and it's so true it breaks my heart. Ricardo, an earlier contributor, referred to Ennis and Jack's first mating being as between two cougars. I like that immensely, for anyone watching big cats mating, in nature programmes, would see, certainly not love, not even lust, but a truly beautiful primal force of nature at work. I wonder if Annie Proulx ever read Mary Renault's novels about Alexander and his lifelong friend Hephaestion, another story of male bonding without effeminacy. Mary Renault (a lesbian lady of phenomenal sensibility) wrote of strong manly bonding too.I ache for the DVD, here in rural England, where I spent a lonely confused childhood and early adulthood. I never consciously spoke to another 'gay' until I was almost thirty, by which time I was set irrevocably onto a solitary path. I was never an Ennis to look at (or Mr Ledger for that matter!), but I do know about incomplete love, it's hellish. I fell heavily in love with a straight guy before I knew it, and the inevitable rejection almost unhinged me. I 'lost' ten years of my life coming to terms with what I was not allowed. I still treasure items, thirty years later, which were Robert's; so I understand totally Ennis' need for those shirts! In the short story Annie Proulx wrote how the guys were shaking when they met after four years, I remember how I shook at times when Rob was near.I'm much too old now for the emotions that have been so fiercely reawakened by this film, I know I should be setting my sights on eternity, but love is indeed a force of nature, and doesn't let go! The need to love remains as fierce now as when the blood still ran so hot, so perhaps it is indeed not about physical need at all. Seeing Ennis alone in the diner, eating his pathetic bit of apple pie, resonates with me quite strongly, for that is me too, thirty years down the line, with my couple of pints in the pub each night, together with my paper or a book, all geared to keeping the loneliness and isolation at bay. Sometimes it all seems so pointless, but even with all the down side I wouldn't have wanted to miss the roller coaster ride of knowing the reality of love, just once.More memories. Their last night in the tent, with Ennis holding a sleeping Jack so protectively, and Jack's anguished ""I wish I knew how to quit you""; Jack's mournful face when he's being propositioned by the rancher; Roberta Maxwell as Jack's loving, understanding mum, with her hand on Ennis' shoulder, ""You are welcome to go up in his room if you want"", said like a queen bestowing an honour; and Kate Mara as equally perceptive Alma Junior probably knowing the source of his pain, and loving him anyway, calling him 'daddy' with a caress in her voice; and Linda Cardellini who might have been Ennis' second chance if things had been different, I noticed them all at the first of my nine cinema viewings, and even Peter McRobbie too as Jack's dad, a deeply unpleasant, sad character. I feel the need to name them with the principals, for their splendid acting and deeply significant characters.A couple of nagging thoughts remain with me, would I have felt such involvement, even empathy, if the two protagonists had been as Annie Prouxl described them (quite plain, certainly not film stars); and too, if Jack hadn't moved on Ennis, would he (Ennis) have ever discovered, or acted upon his attraction to his own sex, or did his one off, unique love for Jack defy labels, and any way does it matter? Sexuality is such a grey area; no wonder fearful (and full of fear!) bigots become so worried and agitated! I cannot remember, in a long cinema going life, ever being so moved and shaken up by a film, and recommend it to everyone. I urge those who think we choose to be gay, simply to BE perverse, to see the film if they dare, and think of the love and need, instilled in us before birth as surely as the colour of our hair, and then ask themselves if it is reasonable or just to tell us we ought to suppress our nature.My header is from Annie Proulx' short story; who is able to say more in half a dozen words than Charles Dickens could in three pages. I'm sorry for writing so much, but it seemed necessary. Best Wishes everyone.Sam.",Brokeback Mountain
1017,anfdude452,A sweeping & epic cinema experience,10,24 December 2005,"Brokeback Mountain was hands-down the best film of the year. With it's heart-wrenching performances, articulate direction, gorgeous scenery, subtle score and incredible script, it is a true piece of art. Heath Ledger, in the best role of his career, is a revelation; his ability to ACT so inexpressive is unbelievable. This film is the beginning of a new chapter in his career. Jake Gyllenhaal has been overshadowed lately by all the praise for Ledger's performance, and I feel this is not fair. He is also fantastic, particularly in one confrontation scene with Ledger. The supporting work is also great, particularly from Michelle Williams & Anne Hathaway; having this film ""under their belt"" will definitely be a career-booster. This film could not have come out at a more relevant time, with the US divided over gay marriage.Before going to see this film, you may think of it as ""the gay cowboy movie"" and after seeing it, you will feel completely different. It is perhaps one of the best love stories in recent years. Go to your nearest theatre and see this film; it's phenomenal. Props to the cast & crew for being so brave to make this film.",Brokeback Mountain
1018,travistime,"A great, true film",10,8 January 2006,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, hands down. This is one of only a handful of films in my life that has ever stayed with me emotionally for days after I have seen it. I do have two problems with reviews I have read. I am a 32 year-old gay male, though not out of the closet, even now totally. I have a problem with reviews I see from hatemongers who only want to continue to mistreat gay people, and I have a problem with many, I think young, gay people who review the show and are disappointed that the characters don't set up house together. Trust me younglings, you cannot imagine the intolerance that existed for us, even still today in many places, but in the early 90s it was like that virtually everywhere in the U.S. You kept your sexuality private because you were afraid you would be murdered or live a life with even more daily harassment than you already had. So, sorry, no gay dances in this film, and to the intolerant I can only say, just imagine if the tables were turned and you were ""suppose"" to be gay; imagine how hard that would be for you. Oscars are deserved for this film, but I fear it may not get it because many are still not understanding or tolerant even until this day. Great western scenes and kudos for showing the true hardship for Michelle Williams' character's situation also; she was great and we have to have sympathy for women who are forced into situations like this by our society. Everyone....see the film now - you will be glad you did. Unfortunately, I have been in love with a guy from my college days for many years now, but he says because of society we cant be together, and he is as we speak planning to marry a woman in order to fit in.

1019,nativedreamer,Victims of Forbidden Love,8,16 January 2006,"This is an interesting and tender movie. However, the build up of the relationship between the two main characters, although necessary, dragged and seemed extremely long.When their first sexual encounter happened, it was sudden and violent, and it fit the mood of subsequent shock and astonishment felt by the two men. It wasn't clear to me what they had felt prior to their encounter about their sexuality. Had they inklings of such desires? Or was it a lightning bolt that hit them? The killed sheep that the man finds the next day is like an omen for their love. Tragedy ahead.Jake Gyllenhaal has these incredible eyes that pour out tenderness and love. I got wrapped up in the love scenes thanks to him, which is my first for a movie about gays.This movie is very much about a time and a culture. And although homophobia is still alive and well in the USA, back then, places existed where those two lovers could have opened their horizons. One of the saddest parts of the movie was that they were trapped by a certain fatalism and ignorance, which highlighted the tragedy of their love.The secondary characters were interesting and did a good job adding to the story. Randy Quaid was great as the Forest Service supervisor who catches them in the act. A particularly moving scene was when they were seen kissing passionately by the wife, and her heart is broken. Another victim added to the heap of forbidden love.",Brokeback Mountain
1020,iblboxing,The Best Movie I've Seen in a L-O-N-G Time,10,31 December 2005,"Prior to writing this comment, I read over the 2006 Golden Globe nominees once again. I wanted to be honest with not only myself, but with the people reading this review that Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Mountain"" was in fact the best movie of the year. Indeed, I would be lying if I said I preferred any other movie from 2005 more. I love film. I love the art of cinema -- the writing, the acting and the directing. Unfortunately, the Tinsletown bigwigs often produce movies that, more or else, serve the purpose of raking in our dollars and little of our ""sense."" I'm not going to bash any particular movie because I fully understand the hard work from every angle that it takes to make a movie. However, it is rare that such a movie as ""Brokeback Mountain,"" with all it's aesthetic beauty, is made. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is just that -- beautiful. Perhaps no other word could describe the film in a panoramic way. From Ang Lee's sharp, point-made directing to Rodrigo Prieto's mouth watering cinematography (most notably the Fourth of July scene) to the dream-like performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, ""Brokeback Mountain"" does what so many films fall short of doing: It captures the heart. It doesn't take but a few of Heath Ledger's emotional grunts and Jake Gyllenhaal's lonely smile to be catapulted full-throttle into what this movie really is: A love story. By the films peak, I was so lost in the love story that I forgot I was watching two callused cowboys fall in love. I did more than watch this movie; I felt it as Ennis del Mar's (Ledger) heart slowly suffocated, as if a boa constrictor were tightly wrapped around it as it painstakingly gasped to beat, as he tried with all his might to dump his love for Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal) into a storage bin somewhere far, far away. Ennis wants so badly to confess his love, but his brain and his heart move forward like trains going in opposite directions. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a movie that one sees for his or her love for the cinema, for storytelling. It is fictional, but drives home non-fiction emotion into anyone who watches it.",Brokeback Mountain

Taking off the scenes and the sonorous band everything the remaining portion is monotonous and without interest.The idea is good but the surrounding tales should be more important, the film can't live only in the history of two bi-sexual cowboys.

Scene after scene. In the end I wound up in tears.The acting is top notch, Larry McMurtry's and Diana Ossana's screenplay pitch perfect and Ang Lee is doing his best directing to date.

1023,catherine_perry,"The ""gay-cowboy"" movie no longer!",8,9 December 2006,"Simply breath-taking. A love story that will literally take your breath away, showing that love is indeed, a force of nature. To be honest, I had been intrigued by this film long before it hit the big screen. There had been many rumours circulating about it and I must admit that I was very interested as to how Ang Lee would tackle this complicated love story. The obvious issue would be that it is the first Hollywood movie that would have the main romance as a homosexual relationship. He achieves miraculous heights, the direction is simply perfect. I was worried that Annie Proulx's short story would be turned into a hopeless Hollywood love flick, thankfully, that right man was in the director's chair. The finished product shows a brutal, stressful and problematic relationship that was doomed to failure. This is also huge praise to the two young actors who undertake amazingly brave and difficult roles. The impact that Ledger's final show of emotion on Brokeback had on the viewer was stunning and Gyllenhaal is brilliant, hopelessly and optimistically in love, his performance really knocks the stuffing out of the audience. Williams is the most wonderful young actress, her shock and pain is so clearly seen and felt by the viewer. I really recommend not to let your prejudices keep you from seeing this movie, as by the time the relationship gets off the ground you have completely forgotten about the sexuality of the characters and can only see the fabulous love story unfolding before your eyes. This film comes highly recommended!",Brokeback Mountain
1024,shmexsay,Miracles can happen,9,24 January 2006,"First of all, I would just like to express my relief that this movie has finally received a well-deserved place on the top 250 movies list.Anyway, I've been wanting to see this for the past month or so. There's been a lot of talk about it, and as I'm a sucker for slash in fanfiction, I was curious to see how it would be played out on the big screen. Before I went to see it, I read the short story (which I enjoyed thoroughly) and pleaded with everyone I knew to come see it with me. Eventually, I convinced two reluctant friends to come along with me.The friends I went to see Brokeback Mountain with were extremely hesitant to see it because all they'd heard was that it was 'the gay cowboy movie' or the one that had 'guys having sex'. A lot of my friends are somewhat close-minded when it comes to open homosexuality (even if it's just acting), so I had a hard time convincing them it was more than just sex.The movie itself was simply amazing. Stupendous, fabulous, magnificent, stunning, marvelous, extraordinary, spectacular, fantastic, wonderful, exhilarating, etc. It was everything I'd read in the positive reviews and even more. I could not have asked for more realistic and heartbreaking performances from Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, and Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway as the two wives were just angry and bitter enough to make their characters seem believable. The cinematography was beautiful; the sweeping views of the landscape were just breathtaking, and they really enhanced the raw, natural love between Ennis and Jack. Every little detail about the movie was so subtle, and it worked in every way possible. I was so relieved about this subtlety because I had expected the acting and the script to be dramatic because face it -- the story is a dramatic one. But no; Ang Lee worked his magic and pulled it off.By the end of the movie, I was sobbing hysterically along with everyone else in my theatre...everyone from the teenage couples to the old men and women, and even -- to my surprise -- my friends. We walked out of the theatre and just stood outside of it for a few minutes without saying a word. The movie had hit us so hard, and when my friends were able to regain their ability to speak, they couldn't stop gushing about how wonderful the movie was.If any movie can work miracles, it's Brokeback Mountain. I highly recommend seeing it.",Brokeback Mountain
1025,prats_patra,Cinematic Splendour,9,6 June 2006,"Director Ang Lee takes care of every little detail in the movie. You notice that in the cloud arrangements and camera placements throughout the movie. When you go back to the scenes in the movie, the more you think about them, the more you realize the true meanings. That said, here starts the real review---------- Entering the theater my expectations weren't that high and I thought that though it had got such good reviews it'll be one of those movies that will end up disappointing me. The story does unfold a little slowly but that really was essential to feel the emotions the characters are feeling. When they're up on the mountains you can really feel the loneliness and solitude in which Ennis and Jack are living in. Once they part ways the movie runs like a journey that one should definitely be a part of. Hours after you finish watching the movie, you can't help but think about the movie. The actors have done a really good job portraying their roles. Each and every one of them whether its Randy Quaid or the female who plays Ennis's daughter. Obviously special references would go to Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal.Heath Ledger- It's like the character was created only for him to play it. He plays it so perfectly and flawlessly what you cannot imagine anyone else in his shoes.Jake Gyllenhaal- His facial expressions!Sigh!!!!The really feel like making you cry sometimes and you feel the disappointment, anger and frustrations he maybe possibly feeling.The movie gives you the liberty to think what you want of it and that's the problem with it because once you start thinking about it, you just can't stop.",Brokeback Mountain
1026,carrot_bIue_blood,An ode to love.,10,6 March 2015,"It feels funny to say that Brokeback Mountain is my favorite film of all time, because I think it almost too good to be just called a film at all, or to critique its incredible technical sophistication. Somehow Brokeback Mountain is way beyond that. I could hear a thousand speeches celebrating gay marriage and equal rights or read a hundred love stories and not be absolutely broken in just two hours as I was after this film. I've never felt waves of excitement come over me as I did sitting in that theater, my face blushing as I watched truth and honesty spill from the screen and onto an unsuspecting audience. You may only see it once, but you'll never forget it.",Brokeback Mountain
1027,Crispfan846,I am so tired of seeing nothing but positive reviews.,6,13 January 2006,"I was looking forward to this film for a couple of years before finally being able to see it. Hearing how ""critically acclaimed"" it was excited me, and actually seeing the film winning a billion times at the ""Critic's Choice Awards"" just made me want to see it even more. So, when it opened this weekend, my butt was in a seat as fast I could get it there.I was extremely disappointed, after all was said and done. The film, as a whole, was mediocre and the story lacked so much. I find myself unable to pinpoint exactly what else the film needed, but it felt a little dry and empty - this is where the possibility of spoilers comes in.To make sure that I get everything, it is important for me to go in chronological order, so here goes.1. The very first time Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis (Heath Ledger) have sex, it feels insanely forced and not at all natural. It seemed as if it was something that was planned and awkward, rather than a natural occurrence. Not once prior in the film was there an inkling that they were sexually attracted to each other, and there was plenty of opportunity to build that part of the relationship up.2. The sex overall was extremely harsh to watch. There were a total of three sex scenes in the film, and each was as harsh as the last. Perhaps it was to show inexperience, but it seemed very violent - especially between Ennis and his wife.3. Save for one scene, you never really felt a romantic connection between Ennis and Jack. The relationship felt forced and didn't feel as though they were actually in love.4. Characters that were just as important as Ennis were basically left out and forgotten. Alma (Michelle Williams) basically disappeared after the divorce; Ennis' other daughter, Jenny, may as well have not even been in the film. Jack's family was left out of most of the film, so we have no idea how they were really affected by anything at all. I would have loved to know how Alma was able to cope with finding out that Ennis was gay and what she told the girls. Her world was basically turned upside down when she caught Ennis and Jack together, and I think that this was a very pivitol moment that should have been addressed. Also, addressing how Jack's wife and son were affected by his monthly trips to Brokeback Mountain would have been nice. As well as delving more into the relationship between Jack and his father-in-law.5. Jack's death, and Ennis' reaction to it were a bit cloudy. Was Jack actually beaten to death or was that merely Ennis' interpretation of it, based on a previous experience he had?6. The ending fell a bit flat. ""Jack, I swear..."" what was that about?I also felt that the film cut a bit too much. Reactions were cut out that should have been left in. Story lines were also cut out, when they should have been left in.The make-up in the film was terrible as well. No one really aged; their hairstyles merely changed. With the make-up and technology available, a few wrinkles here or there would have been more than plausible.The film had lots of potential, but it just fell flat and felt a bit empty. I think that this is the most disappointed I've ever felt after a film in a long time.",Brokeback Mountain
1028,KingArri,Retaliation!,8,23 January 2006,"The wearisome Republican piquancy connected to this film (I quote ""This is what happens when you take the last vestige of American Masculinity i.e. the cowboy, and you turn him into a gay guy"") and many viewers' over-opinionated views on this film (views which obviously extend past Brokeback Mountain and into the real world) has forced me to write in retaliation! Pardoning all those to whom it does not concern, but this is the reason why the vast majority of Americans are regarded as being culturally ignorant by Europeans. I am from London, I am NOT gay, I saw Brokeback Mountain recently and not once did it enter my mind that this film was, quote ""a direct attack on Mid-West values"" unquote, in fact I saw it as quite the opposite - a powerful reminder of the physical and psychological damage suffered by homosexuals during a period of widespread narrow-minded discrimination. After reading many a relentless tirade I realised that there was not one comment posted by these hostile right-wingers that explored the issues put forth by Ang Lee in the film, hence, I think that many have completely missed Ang Lee's intention. He was implying that homosexuality was by no means commonplace or readily accepted by America's Mid-West, in fact, the antithesis of homosexuality, homophobia, was so prevalent there that if you were a gay man living in the Mid-West during the early 1960's and you got caught ""being gay"" then you were most probably going to get murdered. Did you not notice this major point whilst watching the film? An extremely simplistic summary of the film would be this: It is a film about two gay men who, in the face of prejudice and oppression, fall in love, but ultimately their relationship goes nowhere because one of them is too scared to pursue it due to the fact that he vividly remembers seeing the mutilated corpses of two men when he was a child - both were tortured to death for being homosexual, and he knows that the relationship could cost him his life. The unthinkable happens and his lover is killed, supposedly in a freak accident, but we suspect it was at the merciless hands of the despotic bigots that roam the valleys! The man is left to wallow in his eternal misery and regret, wishing that he had followed his heart. The performances are brilliant, the back-drop is formidable and the direction is Ang Lee at his most subtle and thought-provoking best! If you are not a brainless fascist and you enjoy intelligent and emotional cinematic masterpieces then you will love this film.",Brokeback Mountain
1029,gleichstrom-1,Mixed emotions about Brokeback,7,30 March 2006,"To have a ""Refugium"" like Brokeback Mountain must be a nice thing; that is one of my thoughts after seeing this movie. The camera captured its magic very well. Having a place to hang out with your friend/buddy/lover or whatever to swim, drink, smoke, penetrate...and get rid of crying babies and talking wives ;-).But it was not easy to see and feel the love between those guys. And thats what the whole movie did to me; it gave me a painting, and I had to fill out a lot of emotions by myself. That isn't bad, thats what a movie should do, even the best ones; but i expected a bit more in portraying a gay couple. It was hard to go emotionally with them; felt more sorry for their wives perhaps. That thing made it more believable on the other hand. The aging process was not build up stringent; I found myself being more attracted in seeing make-up artists work.""SPOILER"":Strong scenes where there, and they worked out well: visiting the parents and going up to the room, finding the jacket,.... the loss of his love stroke your heart.Summary; if the movie was about a man and a woman, I would not want to see it. So far the ""gay-gimmik"" worked out well to stand out of the rest. The development of ""falling in love"" was too often left to the viewer; not much fantasy in creating real love suspense there; even when they are playing guys who are not able to talk about feelings. But the overall tone created with music and images summed up in an enjoyable cinema- experience like there was no other before.",Brokeback Mountain
1030,rivershore,reviewers?,8,8 January 2006,"It's amazing how many people here are pretending to have seen this movie. They're making all kinds of factual errors and don't fool us who have seen it for a second. I thought IMDb offered this space for honest reviews, not flaming editorials. Someone said the audience gets to see the characters' ""packages"" a few times, which just isn't true. The only nudity (on the men's part) is from a long distance when they're jumping into a lake. I saw the movie two days ago and was moved by it and impressed with the performances. But any movie would have a difficult time standing up to all the hype Brokeback has received. When I saw the trailer a few months ago I knew nothing about the movie and was blown away by it. I kind of wish the movie had sneaked up on me like that, without my knowing so much about the story. All the comedians doing the ""I wish I knew how to quit you"" line and others have kind of ruined it. There were few surprises. Next time, Focus Pictures, release your movies all over the country, all at once. That way comedians and reviewers can't ruin the experience for the majority of us who don't get to see it until a month later.This truly is a love story. I think we're starved for serious love stories. All we get from Hollywood is romantic comedies.",Brokeback Mountain
1031,radiofreechristy,More than a pleasant surprise,8,9 January 2006,"I honestly had no idea what to expect walking in to this film; the trailer was laughable, intriguing at best, and although everything I heard was positive, it was also vague, as if to preserve some precious secret. What caught me off guard was that the secret was blatantly obvious: Brokeback Mountain goes beyond the boundaries of any particular genre. There is, in large part, romance, but it can almost be looked on as a seriocomedy at points as Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) fall for each other in a kind of awkward, stumbling fashion. You've likely all heard the story by now: boy meets boy, boys fall in love, boys drift apart, boys attempt to overcome obstacles to retain their love. Not exactly a standard Hollywood story-- and this is what makes it so good. It's a touching account, a bittersweet love ballad in filmic form; it's not just two men having sex, it's two people attracted on the basis of personality and companionship. It's safe to say this is groundbreaking. Never has the cinematic mainstream seen something so counter-culture based, yet still sound in terms of quality and staying power. With exceptional performances by each and every actor, a haunting, equal parts sparse and full score, and so much more than two teen idols hooking up. This is an intensely emotional experience, far beyond the barriers set by usual mainstream movies. A-.",Brokeback Mountain

I always zealously applaud (and look forward to) movies that shed light on an aspect of society with which not many people are familiar (or don't want to be made familiar). When I left the movie theater, I felt like I had just gotten a punch in the chest, leaving me completely winded. Breathtaking shots, passionate love story, heart-wrenching finale, poignant social commentary.I don't want to say too much, because once I start talking about this movie I won't be able to stop.

1033,pulpfaction06,Cast Aside Your Prejudices and Enjoy this Great Human Drama,10,4 August 2006,"It took me a long time to actually give this movie a chance. I watch its nominations for the Golden Globes and the Academy Awards and i scolded. I made fun of it, the ""Gay Cowboy"" movie. I thought the homosexual theme was the reason it was getting nominated. And I stayed bitter for awhile.But as months passed, id see the advertisements, id see it on the rental shelf. I kept getting curious. I kept having the assumption, that yeah know maybe there's more to it. It took me till the start of August to shake off my friends and my own criticisms', prejudices, and such. The movie that played on my TV in front of me, was not the ""Gay Cowboy"" movie i had made up in my head. It was one of the most beautiful movies, one of the most beautiful human stories I have seen in awhile, at least out of modern cinema.Heath and Jake give the performances of there careers, by taking possibly the best role's of there lives. Both do sensational jobs, and yet Philip Seymour Hoffman, deserved the best actor Oscar that he received. These two men though, fully deserved there nods.The movie is about two lonely people. Broken people, broken from there past who end up fatefully on the same job tending to sheep on Brokeback Mountain. Heath plays Ennis, a quiet, soft spoken young man, and Jake plays Jack, more out-spoken. The two seem opposites but somehow there are similarities that they share.One fateful night the two end up in bed together, and a romance begins. But the problem is that its a forbidden romance, its shunned upon, even dangerous, and Ennis knows this, to a fault, and possibly dwells on it to much, and the two part ways after the summer. They meet there future wives, marry, have kids. But there lives remain unfulfilled. I don't give anything away from saying that, cause there is so much depth so many things that go wrong, and Ennis is hard headed, as much as Jack wants him, it tears him apart, because of Ennis' fears.And essentially that is what the story is about, but what happens on the mountain, or in there personal lives, is bread and butter of the story. Where do they make it after years and years of secrecy, what happens to them, will anything change, can there love exist like it should, without destroying these men.Perhaps this review isn't very clear, but the movie is incredible, cast aside what religious or personal prejudices you may have, and enjoy a great human story. I did.",Brokeback Mountain
1034,aidious,Gay Cowboys. What more could you ask for?,10,18 February 2006,"The cinematography in this film is truly mind-blowing. No really, the best I've ever seen; forget LOTR.The acting is great. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall are totally believable as two bisexual cowboys in love. Ledger has gotten a lot of praise for his role as Ennis, and deservedly so, but I think in this Gyllenhall's performance has not received the praise it deserves. If anything, his character is even more believable than Ledgers, but since I've already said they are both totally believable saying that would see me contradicting myself. Oh well, I'll say it anyway. He's great in it, and both of them deserve the Oscar for best actor.The story is just that, a story. If you expect it to be realistic, your expectations are not going to be met (note how I refrained from saying you'd be disappointed). The short story by Annie Proulx, on which the film is based, was a highly praised piece of work when it was first published. The film doesn't stray far from the story and consequently the story of the film is great too. If, however, you're going to be put off this film, or if you don't like it, because of it's theme (love between two people of the same sex), then you do not deserve to see a film as good as this. It made me cry. And I don't cry - not even at funerals.You may have guessed by now that I quite like this film. Well you'd be wrong. I don't like this film...I love it. I love everything about it. It looks great. The acting is great. The characters are great. The story is great. But not everything in this film is great . The accents are so strong, I probably only understood about 50% of what was said....Oh what the hell...the accents are great too! That said, I might be wrong. I think everything was great, but I was so caught up in the whole film, enjoying every single second of it, I might not have watched it objectively. But then again, surely that's a sign of greatness? Yes, I am sure, the film is well and truly...great. (PS> I won't say great again, promise).Maybe I'm over-reacting to this film because I can relate to the story really well. I don't care if I am. This is my favourite movie ever. It's really great.Doh!",Brokeback Mountain

It is a truly thought provoking, allegorical tale. The performances are top notch from each role and both of the leads give outstanding performances that are right on. It is amazing what a simple story, told beautifully can achieve. Technology is great but this movie is for anyone is tired of blue screen acting and computer driven plots. If you are ""straight"" give it a try and most certainly every gay man should see this film. When I saw the film in suburban Virginia the theatre was packed and not with just a gay friendly audience but with folks of all stripes and it affected everyone that I was sitting near. Ang Lee yet again gives us a film that is thoughtfully made and strikingly told.",Brokeback Mountain
1036,dskurth,"Pass on this film. No love here, and not even gay",2,26 December 2005,"Aside from the film being extremely slow, the film is shot beautifully, and well acted, so if you are into the technique of film making..perhaps it is worth your wild. For the rest of us who are into the story and message of films, that is something completely different.THIS IS NO LOVE STORY OF ANY FORM. Just two spoiled, self centered men, who do not have the emotional strength or character to be honest with themselves and accept the consequences of their choices. The end result is they ""use"" others, in this case the women, for there own narrow needs and pretend that love and desire are limited to a physical relationship with out responsibility. Thus I challenge the content of being nothing more than a weak and sad justification for the abusive treatment of others, under the guides of ""them"" feeling bad. Straight, bi, trans or gay, that is just wrong. As such, I would not recommend a film that glorifies poor human behavior and hides behind actions as being some orientation or acceptance issue.Specifically: First off, who says these men are ""gay""? They are NOT. Both men in the story were with and are attracted to women. This make them at the very least bisexual. Either way, choose one person and BE with them. Anything else is simply not right regardless of the orientation. Second, love is more than sex, which is all this film shows..two men getting drunk, lots of lust and getting relief. In fact NO love was shown at all. True love is a hell of a lot more complicated. The day to day life of caring and being there for some one. The daily grind of life, the commitment, the listening to each other, the support, the loyalty. All we see here is 2 guys lusting for some perceived ""no burdened"" sex.Third, the one man sleeps with third man for money...OK, real ""true love"" being demonstrated here. The theoretical ""love of his life"" he cheats on and he endangers the one other person who is standing by him...his wife. Real champ.I find it sad that they destroy their own lives and the lives of others because of this lack of character. Again, not a film to inspire your life by. Do what is right.This movie just shows what is wrong with many gay-men's relationships (INCLUDING some straight men) and why a majority of this country can not accept the lifestyle. the inappropriate behavior. The lack of self-responsibility, loyalty and the emotional maturity to put sex in the same pot as devotion and dedication. Many Many Gay men seem to remain in this prepuberty state of me me me me and never connecting true love with every day deeds of trust, loyalty and faith into a physical relationship. This movie demonstrates this characteristic flaw perfectly. This film is not worth supporting through you admittance ticket. It belittles and categorizes the many wonderful gay/lesbian people to being irresponsible about love and sex, a VERY ""straight"" perception.Perhaps some day, when someone creates a film of loyalty between truly in love partners who treat others with care and repect, the process and true struggles of coming to terms with a different sexual reference or even the burden of every day life in a world that does not understand. NOW that would be a film worth all this attention. This film is fair from it.The only reason it gets any score is that the directors work is excellent and the actors do a great job, but the story and it's message suck.",Brokeback Mountain
1037,dearlove-james,Deeply Moving...,9,17 October 2005,"This was the best cinematic experience I have had all year. So many movies these days have nothing more than a feature length TV series feel to them, but this movie is as broad and deep as the Wyoming landscape it is set in. It is truly ""cinematic"" and it's emotional depth is equally magnificent. The fact that the main protagonists are gay just makes the story work a little better, the themes are universal.Heath Ledger puts in a one of the best studies of masculinity I have ever witnessed recently on screen. Jake Gyllenhaal is also convincing and emotionally engaging. Ang Lee paces the story with the quiet, brooding rhythm of all Annie Proulx's work with the result that the performances and narrative build up to a resolution that is devastatingly moving.Postscript: It's now a while since I watched Brokeback Mountain and wrote the above review and I feel compelled to add that this movie still haunts me.

1039,MellowMovieChick,I love this Movie!,10,25 May 2006,"I have simply fallen in love with this film!!! Heath Ledger & Jake Gyllenhaal were absolutely phenomenal!!! These two amazing gentlemen captured human emotions & feelings so fantastically I cannot explain. Heath was exceptional as Ennis! He just brought the character to life and made us understand where he was coming from and how difficult it was for him to accept what he was feeling, wanting, and going through. Heath comes across as a stubborn man who doesn't want to accept what he feels for Jake. One of my favorite scenes is when he and Jake say goodbye and Jake's looking at him walk away through the car side mirror. Then Heath's character shows how he feels when he is kneeling down in the barn house and is huffing and puffing and crying because he's so confused, angry, and sad about what's he's feeling inside and because Jake and him just said goodbye. The kissing scenes and the scenes of them lying down together were magnificent. Although the scenes had something to do with sexuality they also had to do with human release and being at peace and ease with another human soul. There was so much art and beauty shown in this film that you can't help but watch it again and again. The maturity and depth shown in this movie is outstanding. I give both Jake & Heath props for their incredible portrayal of two human souls in the most beautiful and realistic way. This film has made me an even bigger fan of both Heath & Jake. I respect them and their talent so much now. I must also admit that seeing them together was a bit of a turn on for me not only because they are two handsome hotties. But also because they portrayed the male species in a more humanly beautiful way than I have ever seen on film. Although Heath seemed so angry and hard to get through to you could understand why and what made him act that way. Some may look at some of the scenes when they're fighting and see them as violent. But for me I saw it as the venting of confusion that they both were feeling and going through. I mean Heath's character was brought up to be some kind of a tough guy and manly man. So when Heath's character Ennis starts to have feelings for Jake's character Jack this ignites Ennis's state of confusion and unwillingness to accept what he's feeling inside. It's like he wants this thing inside of him to go away but he can't control it. It seems to me like that makes him more and more withdrawn through the film and more unable to express himself. He wants to deny what is happening but can't deny his feelings for Jake's character. I really enjoyed this film because it was so mature and so real. I also loved Michelle Williams's portrayal of Ennis's devastated wife. She was right on the money in every scene. I also loved Anne Hathaway as Jack's wife. You could sense what Anne was feeling in a single facial expression! All and all the actors were great. The feel of the film was so real and intense. This will probably be one of my favorite films for a long time to come!",Brokeback Mountain

Now, I know most of you are thinking that I'm simply hopping on the bandwagon, but I truly was blown away by this film. The direction, the cinematography which was beautifully done, the script, the soft-spoken (throughout most of the film, anyway) feelings between the two main characters that spoke a thousand on screen, even the simple, somber score was the perfect touch. The simplicities of this movie are what make it so fantastic. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal took on their characters with such ease and subtlety, you forget they're even acting. Nowadays, with movies so action-filled or complex with subplots after subplots, such a movie as Brokeback is as refreshing as a cup of lemonade on a summer's day.

What has bits and pieces of the elements that fully presented could have made this a book-match to THE LAST PICTURE SHOW is a majorly flawed missed chance.Beautiful scenery/cinematography with Canada as a totally acceptable ""Wyoming"". Four female actresses who are fine, fine, fine. One well-known actor (Quaid) who is so good he disappears into his role. Solid support from actors in small roles. Some excellent scriptwriting AROUND the main story. And finally, (aside from a handful of moments where the acting ""shows"")an astounding ""what-James-Dean-mighta-been"" performance by Heath Ledger. Really and truly, this actor picks up stylistically where Dean left off and develops it further. Amazing! So what went wrong? No understanding of the central story and its nuances by the scriptwriters and the director. No passion/obsession on display (isn't that what the story is about?) After a wierdly ""off"" initial sexual encounter, all remaining encounters are staged like warm and fuzzy teenage ""puppy love"". There is no sense of two adult men caught in the middle of something which is emotionally mysterious and powerful to both Jake is way out of his element here. He tries hard, but this isn't his territory (see his excellent work in DONNIE DARKO and JARHEAD) Ledger deserves the Oscar for not only doing his (superb)job, but somehow reacting to a not-present-in-this-movie person with whom he is pulled he is pulled into an emotional vortex.The big issue: for all the trumpeted ""breakthrough"" of BROKEBACK there is no real risk here, particularly where feelings and emotions BETWEEN actors are concerned.

Love is all too often the victim of our hesitation.NOTE: I am so disappointed at all the comments from gay men who think the film breaks no ground because it does not show more open affection/sex/whatever or because it does not support their gay agenda. A big part of he success of this effort will be in what it does not say or do. There are too many in-your-face gay films that have already done more harm than good in chipping away at homophobia. Some people don't want to be confronted so directly with alternative lifestyles. And to apply today's sophistication to a situation that begins and ends 20 to 40 years ago, when attitudes and fears were much more difficultly to confront is a great mistake. Ang Lee is already being accused by the ""Christian"" reviewers of promoting ""Hollywood's gay agenda."" To the contrary, he is doing just the right thing to show how universal love and loss are. Far from promoting such an agenda, his effort shows clearly that whether or not one approves of ""love"" between two people, one must concede that love and loss take their toll on anyone who feels one and suffers the other. This message is far more likely to evoke sympathy from unlikely audience members than a few minutes of explicit hay rolling and intimate kisses. For that, perhaps viewers should stick to the Logo Channel.",Brokeback Mountain

Instead I saw a poor quality product with poor direction, poor diction, unconvincing (or absent) passion, hurt, and a broken story line. In a few years, maybe the glowing critics will relook at the movie and reflect that their hype and hope for glory was not repaid with either art or a quality performance. For now, some of us will be the only ones to realize that it was a boring, poorly crafted, inarticulately presented movie that leaves the impartial viewer empty and disappointed.

1044,jrdallasjr,Three Times in Three Days,10,19 December 2005,"Majestic! ""Brokeback Mountain"" is majestic. Friday, Saturday and Sunday I climbed up and down ""Brokeback Mountain."" Literally first in line at the ticket counter when it opened, I saw this world-class masterpiece three times, and I'll see it 30 more, I'm sure. Remember to breathe when you are watching this film. The altitude often makes it difficult to breathe. Acting is among the best-ever. Mr. Ledger joins Sir Anthony Hopkins as the only two actors I know who can pack into a single look or gesture an encyclopedia worth of meaning, feeling and impact. I was positively knocked over by his performance, often touched at levels of artistic expression that movie actors normally do not reach (or I don't allow them to reach). This movie is about love of every type. Sometimes clueless wives, former wives, children, lovers, former lovers, and hundreds of other family, friends and strangers have sustained physical and emotional sucker punches similar to those thrown in the movie. When love is that real, that deep and that natural, we men and women are brought up full yet short to all of our senses. Nothing in our US culture prepares us for the burst of light from within. This movie will open millions of minds and hearts for decades to come, and not a moment too soon. For this all-round achievement the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should create an award ranked above Best Picture. Or at the very least, the Academy should create a new platinum statue for this Best film, two male Oscars embracing  wearing cowboy hats.",Brokeback Mountain
1045,acheronbabe101,Brokeback Mountain? Is it really all its hyped up to be?,6,21 January 2006,"I decided to watch this movie because of Heath Ledger. I wanted to see if he could master this role. I was pleasantly surprised when he did. He is superb in this movie and so is Jake J. However, the movie is a bit disturbing and for lack of better word, ""wierd."" While it is a romance movie, it is a very aggressive and abusive type of romance. The two lovers (Heath and Jake) are always fighting--in fact, they've both made each other bleed on occasion. The first ""love"" scene is extremely frightening at first in its explosive passion. (Jake fights Heath for sex.) I think that the plot is mediocre at best. There's a scene with a bear somewhere along the way, and nothing happens. I expected the bear to attack Heath and for Jake to come along and rescue him, further enhancing their bond with each other--but no, the horses run away and so does Heath? While the movie addressed issues that need to be brought to the light like the inability of a person to choose who to love, it lacked depth. It dragged for most of the time, and then it ended abruptly. I think that another director could have really captured the emotions and thoughts of the characters in a much better way--making this film much better than it actually was.",Brokeback Mountain

However, I felt the plausibility of the story line, the editing and the pace of the movie to be hugely disappointing. Further, Ang Lee, I do not think fulfilled all the duties of an outstanding direction effort. Many questions are left unanswered as to why the main characters pursue the life choices they made. For me, there was a forced effort here to deal with a set of touchy, but all to real, issues in today's world, and so it did not ring true for me. Medium result - if I want to see a romance, I will still turn to Dr. Zhivago.",Brokeback Mountain

They gradually become friends, and eventually the relationship evolves into something much more. They live in a time and place where their love is unacceptable, so they resort to furtive meetings in solitary places. Life is messy, people get hurt. But the love endures. Timeless plot. Why is this one any different or any better?I'm sure many people are going to provide better plot outlines than I could. And there will be far too many people who will avoid this movie because of the controversial nature of the love story. I feel sad about that, because we really need to get past the stereotypes. (I was actually pleasantly surprised by, and proud of, the number of straight men in the theatre.) It makes me very sad that women can't seem to find the depth of love with each other that men can. This movie disturbed me; not so much because of the forbidden relationship, but more by the knowledge that I will never know the strength and enduring quality of this kind of love.I am just a little bit embarrassed to have been a witness to it; I am so proud of Ang Lee for making it. Thank you.",Brokeback Mountain
1048,heyjoem-1,well done but flawed film,10,21 December 2005,"Brokeback Mountain is an excellent film but something about it really bothered me. i read the Annie Proulx short story and it had the same problem. i never got any indication of why these two guys were attracted to each other. there had to be some physical attraction but both the film and short story remain mute on the subject. since it was a physical love, i assume they were hot for each other on the basis of looks. there is no denying the spiritual bond but both the film and the short story neglect the point that these cowboy hunks had a physical attraction to each other. this physical attraction is the primary focus of gay men. while it is a superficial characteristic it is a necessary one in the gay world which is all based on appearance. still, the film works as a love story which many can appreciate but i doubt many people will go to see it. heath ledger should win the Oscar for best actor and i sincerely hope he does.",Brokeback Mountain
1049,SurfBrahSC,"Moving, and Important",10,4 January 2006,"The first time I saw this movie I must admit that I was completely touched by what I saw. The second time I saw this movie I was... completely moved and almost transfigured by it. This movie is ""Maurice"" revisited, but placed on an American landscape. This movie not only proves that there is often more to a person than that which meets the eye, but it drives that point home more than any I have seen in recent times. Gays have long been proving that they do not necessarily fit the stereotype that the media (and popular culture, in general) so often attempts to foist on us. ""Brokeback Mountain"" takes an experience, that is often blown way out of proportion through its use of stereotype, and fills us with something that is completely devoid of that caricature. I think that is important for the gay community because it depicts another side of the community that is not always shown as readily as the other. Bravo to the writers for showing this other side of the gay community that so often goes unrecognized. Many of us do live conservative lives where it is necessary to be more guarded as we struggle with a very difficult issue. The actors who portrayed the lead characters were nothing short of phenomenal, and seeing it the second time gave me an even deeper look into their performances. Their characters share experiences that are at once joyous, and heart-wrenching. Those few moments they have to spend together, the gleam in their eyes when they see each other, and the tears in their eyes when they have to leave one another's side. The first time I saw the movie I felt a little empty upon never really hearing the word ""love"" mentioned. The second time I saw it, I saw all the expressions that made up for that. Using the word ""love"" within the context of this movie would have risked taking it to a different level. And I don't think it needed to go there. These were two men who couldn't even admit outwardly to each other that they were gay, it comes as no surprise that the word ""love"" would not enter their vernacular. In fact, the true connection to their own emotions isn't solidified enough to go there yet. You knew these two men loved each other simply by the way they looked into each other's eyes. The loving, heartfelt embraces they share, the physical aggression that comes out as a result of their difficulty in fully accepting what they feel are profound. Heath Ledger brings out this internal difficulty in a way that is incomparable, and for a straight actor to be able to throw caution to the wind and find it in himself to bring out the feelings of someone (like me) with whom he may not be able to completely understand himself is incredible. And do it so flawlessly. It shows that love knows no orientation or gender boundaries. Jake Gyllenhal is nothing less than outstanding himself in his portrayal of Jack. Although Jack isn't exactly open about his sexuality, he is able to connect with it in a way that Ennis can't. And it's wrenching to watch his own struggle as it matches up to that of Ennis's. It isn't unlike my most recent relationship, and that's why this movie had such a profound impact on me. Though I am not a cowboy, my ex was raised in a conservative ranching community of West Texas. He and I both had the same religious, social, and political belief systems that made such a relationship seem impossible. But while I was able to see an ability to throw caution to that wind and try, he wasn't able to. The line from the movie that still haunts me is when Jack says that he doesn't know how to ""quit"" Ennis. 6 months after my breakup, I still am at a point where I don't know how to ""quit"" my ex either. I guess that's what true love does to you. A standing ovation goes out to all the creators of this movie who showed that love between consenting adults knows no boundaries. I know that I, for one, loved my ex to such a deep level that I would have put my life on the line for him. And you don't give up your life for someone just because you like to sleep with them. It goes so much deeper than that. This movie isn't a fantasy. It is the reality for many. And no movie hits closer to my own home than this one.",Brokeback Mountain
1050,lavieneko-1,angst does not equal depth,1,27 December 2005,"While the acting is superb and the filming is beautiful, this movie falls short before it even begins with a story that has no point. The point of a story is to have a beginning, middle, and end. The point of a movie is to take people where they've never been and share something with them. Perhaps there are people out there who have never felt hopelessness or depression, and maybe those people can learn something from this movie, but other than that I really don't feel this movie brings anything new to the viewer. The entire point of the movie seems to be ""life is pointless and will never get better, no matter what."" Angst does not equal depth. The characters angst quite a bit, but never do anything to improve their state in life. Instead of having obstacles and overcoming them, or at least TRYING to, they simply exist in a horrible depth of ""poor and depressed"" for the entire movie, and never pull out of that at all.As someone that's read far too many badly written fan fiction and writings by angsty teens, I can assure you that angst does not automatically equal depth. ;) It never, ever does. I would expect more from Ang Lee than what I get out of fiction written by angsty emo 13 year old girls, but this movie falls into the same category as most slash fiction does, which is massively disappointing.This movie was not sad or tragic, it was simply depressing. If you want to feel depressed and hopeless and leave the theater feeling as if nothing matters, then this is the movie for you. Otherwise I'd avoid it. Depression is a real part of life, and it is something that a lot of people can relate to, especially in a society where being outed and gay is practically a death sentence. However, a movie where nothing happens except the characters are depressed the entire time and nothing changes doesn't seem to have much point to me. I guess the main point of this review is ""Wow, that was a downer.""",Brokeback Mountain
1051,duboisgabr,Good but dated morality,8,29 December 2005,"There is a lot of talk about the film-critics talking about this movie. But I think the real word on the street is that it's just kinda okay and sorta long-and-drawn out. I just checked the movie out and it is a very well crafted film. It has a simple plot and is totally character oriented which I like a lot. The scenery is amazing and the beginning has a stillness that feels straight out of that great Peter Bogdanovich flick ""The Last Picture Show"". To be honest I didn't mind Brokeback's slow pace but I did have difficulty feeling this great love that everyone is talking about. I like Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall as actors but I really got zero chemistry between these two characters on screen. Their first meeting at work felt awkward and their first physical encounter was almost unbelievable. Everything happened too abruptly. If this is Heath's first time with a dude he wouldn't be slamming the guy's butt right out of the gate. And I don't think the other dude would be giving it up so fast either. There would be more exploration and awkwardness. But I realize they have to move the story so I just went with it. There were some other problems (their first reunion on the steps at his wife's home..who would be that bold?)but overall I thought the film was very involving It just bummed me out that the ending has the same stupid morality that our retrograde society has been preaching for years. Love a man and you will end up savagely murdered or horribly alone in a shitty old dust bowl trailer. There are other indie flicks that are way more advanced in their themes and I'm not sure why they're not getting as much praise and attention.",Brokeback Mountain

The intimate scenes were shot very well and not offensive. I think it gave a realistic view of what men of that time and persuasion had to go through as it pertained to societal views. They were not allowed to ""come out of the closet"" as it were and had to marry and have children just because ""society said so"". Guess things have come a long way since then. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were fabulous. Both did excellent acting jobs and maintained their characters personalities superbly throughout the whole film.Definitely a film of unrequited love in lots of respects. Sad from that aspect.

1053,smalling_60626,A movie about sexuality in which sexuality does not dominate the movie,10,8 January 2006,"BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is in my top three of 2005 movies, a year full of outstanding movies. I add my name to the hearty accolades my fellow reviewers have posted, and just to keep things short I'd like to point out the following: BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is NOT: A ""gay cowboy romance,"" if by that you mean hearts & flowers; A ""three hankie movie,"" if by that you mean predictable melodrama; A work that fosters any ""gay agenda,"" if by that you mean a well-meaning but inappropriately earnest discussion of social issues rather than a moving work of fiction.Here's what BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN IS and HAS: Based on a wonderful long (55 pp.) short story by author Annie (SHIPPING NEWS) Proulx, who grew up in the Wyoming of the story and film; Wonderful dialog, most of it taken from the book; Impeccable performances by all and sundry, including Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhall, Anne Hathaway, Randy Quaid and others; Knockout scenery, both mountains and plains; A sometimes depressing, but at all times realistic look at a rarely-explored aspect of American life; A kind of ""pocket epic"" that spans twenty years in the life of the Gyllenhall and Ledger characters; Well worth seeing by anyone who can handle an R-rated movie.***BIG HUGE SPOILER***. I have to disagree with the critics who said that BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN runs from 1963 only to the mid-1970s. Proulx's book makes it very plain that the two young men were ""not yet twenty"" when the story begins and that Jack was 39 when he died toward the end of the story. Therefore, at least twenty years have elapsed. That's why I called it a ""pocket epic"" above. **SPOILER**See you at the flicks?

1054,justin-sleeper,A Different Look,10,23 January 2006,"""Brokeback Mountain"" gives us a different look at homosexuality and same-gender love from the mainstream media. Homosexuality has broken into the mainstream by way of shows such as ""Will & Grace"" and ""Queer Eye For the Straight Guy."" These views show people that are open to their homosexuality, are comfortable with their feelings, and embrace who they are. ""Brokeback Mountain"" shows a much different view. These men are not comfortable with how they feel. They look and behave as they ""should"" in public while they feel an incredible attraction to each other in private. This struggle makes the story incredibly tragic, not only for the lovers, but for everyone else in their lives.",Brokeback Mountain
1055,BeckyJean-2,A lot of hype--VERY little in the delivery.,4,11 January 2006,"I saw this film fully prepared to ache for the two main characters. I looked forward, in that awful/sweet way, to my heart breaking for the 2 hours or so i'd spend in the theater. I was sure i'd identify with that primal unrequited-love-pain we've all felt at some point in our life, tho i was SURE mine would pale in comparison to these two character's plight. I was sure i'd feel all of that when i saw how desperately they yearned for one another. Not carnally, but for one another's soul and heart. But most of all--i wanted to see and feel that they were truly 'in love' and devoted to the ideas of one another for the 20 odd years this film spans. What i got instead was a dull, drawn out, not NEARLY as well acted as expected, lack-luster film that was way too long, and way too empty. First let me say--i admire both of these men as actors. Though I found Ennis to be well portrayed by Heath Ledger, after the first 45 minutes of his chronic mumbles and grunts for answers, and Jake's (Jack's) VERY fake country accent--i was reduced to eye rolls and the occasional snicker. As the film progressed, I was looking for them to finally connect in some emotionally poignant, or at the very least enlightened, way. And that does NOT mean over a bottle of whiskey, and a romp in the tent. I believed, thru other reviews that i'd read, that these two men would fall deeply and completely in love with one another's souls--not just the excitement of their bonking. If this was to be just the starting point of a truer and deeper love that was to evolve from that first romp, i wish it had been portrayed better, because i never felt any emotional connection or bond between the two, until the very end...over two very old and bloodied shirts, and it even that was pretty weakly done, at best. While Heath was better at displaying a man agonized by feelings he'd never imagined could exist for him, Jack simply struck me as a gay man--determined to push his wishes and desires into Ennis' life--right from the get'go. Jack's relentless pursuit of Ennis was both frustrating and sickening for me, especially as he expressed that his ""needs"" weren't being met when Ennis had to postpone yet another 'weeklong fishing trip' because of his job. Jack was both needy, and manipulative--and i never felt pity or compassion for him...not once. In fact, his famously quoted ""I wish i could quit you"" sealed the deal for me. Ick and double ick--and get the ""bleep"" out of Ennis' life, you loser! He further disgusted me by his open ended eye-lash batting at other men--whether it was the Rodeo clown he offered a beer to, or the husband of his wife's girlfriend. I mean--for cryin' out loud! If you want to be with men--DIVORCE YOUR WIFE, and be with men. Don't torture Ennis into believing he's 'the only one' OR your wife into believing SHE has your fidelity when you obviously yearn for something else. He was a selfish, self indulgent man who couldn't possibly have truly 'loved' Ennis as Ennis loved him. Thus--any idea of this being a ""great love story"" were foiled for me.Ennis' struggle was at least palpable and real. And tho i wish the direction of his character hadn't been quite so much of a ""strong and silent"" cliché, i was moved by this man who was truly tormented by his self-imposed purgatory, and his knowledge that he was not strong enough to live any differently. So, in the end--the film was bleak (despite the beautiful scenery) and disappointing. I really wanted to love this movie. There have been so many other indi films made covering similar subject matter (tho not filmed with head-lining cowboys, mind you) with much more finesse, and more heart. I'll stick with small budget films for my thought provoking media in the future.",Brokeback Mountain

I really hope this film wins many Oscars; it will earn every one of them. This movie was very powerful and when I went into the theater I didn't expect to see very many supporting this movie because of all the prejudice against gays, my community isn't very open it doesn't seem, but I walked in there and not only did I see a lot of people I had a hard time finding a seat! I was so happy that so many came to view this picture but I also know many people that will not go see it because it has homosexual love in it, and that really saddens me.

1057,zip91413,Everybody knows the top three moments in their lives that most affected them.,10,14 January 2006,"My number one moment was when I was seven years old. My parents suspected that I might be gay and had sat me down. I knew I was in trouble and I was crying, and my mom could barely speak and said, ""I don't know what to say. I feel like crying too."" And then they just looked down on me, barely managed to hold their tears, and let me cry.But in those few moments I had a little meeting with myself, and I said to myself, ""I have always been the same person. I may get older and wiser, but I bet I'll always BE the same person.""Another thing most adults remember is the moment when they realized that their parents weren't always right, and not right in a 'you can't have the candy now' kind of way but right in a 'wow - I'm more enlightened than my parents' kind of way. And I've asked friends about this and they remember being about 20 or so and passing up their dad in math or 25 and having a higher salary than their parents ever did or being 18 and their mom asking for relationship advice. Well that moment for me was the same moment, right there at seven.As confident as I am about who I am, I can still identify with the main character and feel lucky that all that my parents did was sat down and watched me cry. Reading these reviews and seeing how many lives have been ruined in similar circumstances enrages me. Unfortunately the people who would most benefit from seeing this movie are the ones who don't want to see it: the ones who are ruining lives. But thankfully, the people whose lives could be ruined ARE seeing the movie. If this prevents just one child from being born into an unhealthy dishonest relationship then the world is that much better off.I still am amazed at my insight at seven: I still sit down again for periodic meetings with myself and find that I'm exactly the same person with an expanded vocabulary and an older body.",Brokeback Mountain
1058,duffy-mn,"visually stunning, but lacks chemistry",4,2 February 2006,"Jake Gyllenhaal saves this movie: without him there would be no chemistry and no real heart. While a visually beautiful movie (I would expect nothing less of Ang Lee), it seems controversial for the sake of being controversial. I never felt the spark that apparently has earned Heathe Ledger an Oscar Nomination for this role...it seemed the whole time that he was uncomfortable in the emotional mantle of homosexuality and his downward life spiral is nothing but depressing. The redeeming qualities of this film lie in the supporting roles, like Gyllenhaal & Hatheway & Williams. With such a young and 'hip' cast it's no surprise that the film has been successful in theaters, but I know I personally went expecting something more after all the rave reviews.

Having read the short story I thought it might be a challenge to get a two hour ten minute film from it. Boy was I wrong. They added long pauses, beautiful shots of scenery and extended scenes beyond what was necessary and comfortable for some audience members. By comfortable, I mean they got boring. Not as a scene by itself but as a whole. By the end of the movie there were notable coughs, fidgeting and I personally couldn't wait for the film to end. In typical Ang Lee fashion, there is minimal dialogue and the lead character tends to lack any emotion (see Eric Bana in Hulk). The make-up for the aging was a huge flaw as I would have believed this took place over a few weeks and not 20 years if it weren't for the children growing up. Michelle Williams gave a very realistic performance as did Jake Gyllenhall, but Heath Ledger was, I feel due to direction, a let down as his broody character went from mysterious to tedious in a short amount of time. The cinematography was fantastic, but that does not make a great film.

Regardless of what that may mean about American culture, I personally (in addition to I'm sure a hell of a lot of other people) disliked the movie because it was impossible to empathize or sympathize with either of the main characters. This is because the two main characters in that movie were postmodern narcissists who expressed their 'love' for each other by constantly bitching to each other about their confused feelings and dissatisfaction with themselves and the other. That general feeling is too overbearing to warrant sympathy, hence I wasn't emotionally involved with the characters and thus didn't like the movie.

This film, to me, was none of the above. Don't get me wrong, the film is strong in all those areas, but does not excel in any. I suspect my underwhelming attitude stems from the fact that I am not awed that someone would write/produce/sell such a film in the U.S. I am too old to be shocked by this and too old to be impressed with the entire body of work simply because the lead characters are gay. In fact, I would hazard to guess that many people are afraid to criticize the film, fearful that they would be labeled homophobic. Call me ignorant, but I just don't get it.

The scenery adds to the beautifully told love story and the performances are praiseworthy, but it leaves that question still unanswered. I had read that the film was about 'impossible love"" and not actually about the romance between two 'guys' and thought this was just a marketing scheme. Having watched it, though, I must say that it touches some issues about love that are so universal that the fact the two lovers are the same sex becomes secondary, if at all relevant. The sources of the impossibility are many-fold: besides being two young men, there are family ties, social acceptance and economic and cultural background. Who can say which one is strongest? Roughly ten human beings have their lives limited in many aspects, including in their happiness and their very humanness, and I thought the film asks us: ""what does society gain from this?""",Brokeback Mountain
1065,lamerlu,This is a fake,1,2 March 2006,"I really do not understand what's the fuss about. This is a very mediocre boring movie. The only fact that makes it so prominent is that two protagonists are cowboys and they are gays. They cannot do anything with this. They don't do anything with this. They just lead their boring, more then ordinary life ant that's it. But actually I don't need homosexual cowboys to observe all of this. I already have Bill Murray in Broken Flowers and Lost in Translation for this purpose. And definitely his way of doing nothing is much more convincing. And definitely it's not the only example.Love? Roger Ebert says this could be a story of two women or two people of conflicting religions. Right: this could be a story of anything! And of nothing at the same time. The story needs personality, it's got to be personalized, in other case it's just a piece of wasted time.PS I would like to add something to this. First, I am not a homophobe, I feel fabsolutely free communicating with people of all kinds. Second, I truly admire previouse Ang Lee's works considering him one of the most amazing directors ever. But talking of this movie I cannot even say it's the worst one. Most of 'the worst' movies are the funniest ones (like Peter Jackson's Bad Taste, etc.) It's just boring and useless. Do we see the most outstanding pictures of nature? Nope. Is this the most touching drama? Nope. Do the actors work at their best? Remember any of Al Pacino's or DeNiro's or amybody else's of that kind role and admit: no.",Brokeback Mountain
1066,lotrfreak50,not as good as I expected,7,30 May 2006,"For all the credit given I was expecting a lot more from this film. Sure the scenery and acting was great and the portrayal of homosexuals refreshing - actually making them out to be human which I for one totally approve of - but could it go any slower? OK I'm being harsh I know and after reading through a number of other comments, which generally rate it between 9 and 10 out of 10, I feel kind of mean BUT while I would watch it again, it just didn't live up to the expectations it had earned from previous reviews. I saw the film after the 'mad dash to the cinema' episode and while I was interested in the characters life and the beautiful scenery and the...characters life?... I did expect a lot more from such a highly acclaimed film. While the film was not as brilliant as I expected the cinematography was stunning, the scenery magnificent and the acting superb (even though our brilliant Heath Ledger barely opened his mouth when he spoke. Even after my harsh comments I would still recommend the film as after I saw it I appreciated it more. All in all a nice film but nothing overly extraordinaries",Brokeback Mountain
1067,cassidys-1,Now a firm favourite,10,15 March 2006,"I saw this film about a month ago, but even now it firmly stays with me, thats why I have to comment on it.This was one of the most powerful pieces of cinema I have been fortunate enough to experience. The beautiful way this story has been adapted leaves you nothing less than haunted. It does nothing short of move you to the core as you become involved with the tragic love story of Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jack Gillenhall).Although a controversial topic in some places even now, it shows you that love has no boundaries. It follows both their lives over a space of twenty years, as they both enter into conventional marriages, with a tiny space of their lives shared together at snatched secret moments. However, those moments are the times they both live for, each other.Ang Lee is nothing short of a genius in this beautifully shot film, with the closing scene being one that will stay with me forever. A definite must see!",Brokeback Mountain

I'm glad this didn't win best picture, but disappointed it lost the razzie.you stay classy.....world. 1/10 stars.",Brokeback Mountain
1069,vmkladylazarus,I wish I could quit you.,10,25 March 2006,"When we think of the Western genre, we think of staunchly heterosexual images of a swaggering John Wayne, shootouts at the saloon, epic bar brawls, prostitutes, scalpings. It's all very masculine. For the corn-fed wahoos that think there's nothing gay about cowboys: one of the Village People is a cowboy. Come on. With all the furor of controversy the film caused simply because it involves two men, it is essentially a story of doomed love just like Romeo and Juliet, Heathcliffe and Cathy, or Othello and Desdemona. It is the story of two ranchers: the surly, quiet Ennis Del Mar (portrayed by native Australian Heath Ledger, who seemed to be chewing on something the entire film to stop his accent coming out) and the wily rodeo clown Jack Twist (played here by the very dashing Jake Gyllenhaal, whom I loved in Donnie Darko). They meet as they're hired one summer to corral sheep, and their bond soon spirals into a frenzy of passion and forbidden love. Fear of discovery forces them to pursue normal lives, get married and have children, but it all feels so hollow and routine. Four years on they rediscover each other and have illicit ""fishing trips"" up on Brokeback Mountain, until tragedy strikes. This story comes to us from the 60's, an era where homosexuality was persecuted much more than it is now. It also takes place way out in rural Wyoming, not Metropolitan New York where gays are a dime a dozen. The material is handled with typical sensitivity from Ang Lee, who brought us The Ice Storm. As in The Ice Storm with it's wintry landscape, I think the mountain was as much a character in this film as Jack Twist or Ennis Del Mar. With it's lofty green hills, rolling fields, and birdsong; with it's fierce rainstorms that pummeled the camp, it symbolised the turbulent passion between the two men and was an ideal backdrop for them to consecrate their romance. The story unfolds at a deliberate pace with a lot of attention to detail and gorgeous photography enhanced by the beautiful, lonely, country tinged score by composer Gustavo Santaolalla (well deserving of his Oscar). I love how the nightscenes are almost silvery black as Jack puffs on a cigarette under the moon. What really gets me about this film is how convincing the intensity of Ennis and Jack's relationship is. When they embrace, they're almost pulling each other down. They have such strong feelings about each other and don't know what to do with them that they have a punch up and break each other's noses. That's real love. Summary: a tragic tale of forbidden love in the untamed wilds of the American mountains, told completely without sentimentality. Plus two beautiful men snogging. Well worth a watch.",Brokeback Mountain
1070,kstern,Rang true to me,10,7 November 2005,"I wish I had brought a BOX of Kleenex for the last 20 minutes of this film. It will be a contender for awards for cinematography, director, adapted screenplay, actor (Heath Ledger), supporting actress (Anne Hathaway, Michelle Williams) and supporting actor for Jake Gyllenhaal. Obviously in the running for Best Picture too. I've been reading some reports about people who say they have ""never encountered a gay cowboy, and doesn't think it's right for Hollywood to portray Wyoming as a state with gay cowboys."" Well, I live in Hollywood now, but I grew up in the rodeo culture during the time period of this movie ('60s) and I can assure you there were lots of gay cowboys. My mother raised horses and my brother rode broncs. There were always championship rodeo cowboys hanging out at our house. I didn't necessarily appreciate that culture but I knew it well. Ang Lee has done an amazing job putting together a film that is not only beautiful, but accurate.",Brokeback Mountain
1071,Sean-134,To those disappointed,10,26 January 2006,"Well. I read the story before I saw the movie, which is pretty faithful to the original story. The first time I read it, I was eager to know what the story is, how much sex is in it, etc.. And I felt the story was pretty thin after I read it. Nothing major and heavy. Then after two months, I was bored and reread the story, slowly and I started to fully appreciate it. Ang Lee said in an interview that he once complained to the author how hard it was to adapt the story. One of the difficulty I can see is that the story doesn't disclose information about characters right away when things happen. For example, the flash back scene. In the story, right after the quarrel when Jack and Ennis last met, it goes like this: ""What Jack remembered and craved in a way he could neither help nor understand was the time that distant summer on Brokeback when Ennis had come up behind him and pulled him close, the silent embrace satisfying some shared and sexless hunger. "" It is a memory Jack cherished and held on to. It is one of the few times that Ennis actually initiated intimacy and expressed his feelings to Jack. It is a proof to Jack that Ennis, though he would never say so and would probably seldom express again, actually loves Jack. It is a memory that supported Jack through all these twenty lonesome years. However, such an important scene was not mentioned when the story and the movie first told their stories on brokeback mountain. At that time, it was rough, casual, like a fling, began and ended.So I totally understand why people complain that there were not enough love between Jack and Ennis on BrokeBack Mountain. It was meant that way. Rough, casual, like a fling. That is how the story appear to be, to viewers and to themselves, just like real life. But then 20 years later, looking back, things began to take on additional meanings. That is why many have described the movie as subtle and haunting.After I read the story the second time, nothing happened immediately. But when I was driving home I thought of Jack's shirt, how Jack had always loved Ennis deeply ever since Brokeback Mountain but never told Ennis so, how he actually felt when he only mentioned so slightly to Ennis, let us get a ranch together... totally cool about it like nothing important just something slipped through his mind; how he must have felt when Ennis time and again said no, disappointed and postponed; and how much he loved Ennis that he kept coming back. When I saw the movie, during the last scene when Ennis and Jack met, on hearing that Ennis cannot make August, Jack uttered the 'quit you' line, I just sobbed uncontrollably. :) But then again, the shirt scene is the last scene in the movie. Without the knowledge, the last meeting may well just be another quarrel. It almost seems like the movie as well as the story, rewrites itself many times along the way, with each piece of new information about past being revealed. To me, it is unique in that way; but it does require people to keep thinking about it after the film ends and I totally understand if people don't (I didn't the first time) they can see the film lacking.",Brokeback Mountain
1072,grinderny,Brokeback in retrospect,10,30 July 2006,"This comment is coming from a person who has taken the trip up that mountain 41 times. You might call this being quite obsessed, but it is an obsession that I truly don't wish to quit. Every time I see the film I am simply awed by its sheer artistry, the magnificent cinematography (should have won the guild award as well as Oscar), the multi-faceted acting of the cast, especially Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, the moving and subtle musical score, and the near perfection of the screenplay, all woven together by the genius of Ang Lee. There is always something new that I discover, and the final scenes always move me emotionally. Never has a film affected me so viscerally that I simply can't get enough of it. The fact that Oscar snubbed this incredible film by denying it the Best Picture award is far surpassed by the effect this moving film has had on countless thousands of people worldwide who have been similarly affected. Brokeback Mountain, I daresay, will one day be considered one of the great love stories of all time, and certainly the outstanding love story of this generation.",Brokeback Mountain

How can I feel so entirely different from when I went in?It's not a detached sadness, not at all. It's a grief, a feeling that I was watching the whole time and could do nothing, a suspicion that so much time has passed and left so many stories behind. I am not an emotional person, and yet each time the credits roll I have to take five minutes to myself, to rub my forehead and swallow the need to just break down. It's not fair, I think. It didn't have to happen that way. It didn't.I forgot I was watching actors. I feel like it all happened to real people. I feel...Broken. It gives me an ache in my gut.

I found my coping mechanism in fan sites and fan fiction, where others, just like me, tortured and wrenched by what was experienced on that mountain, were able to discuss what they felt, how it left them, and what was to come in their lives. Beautifully written stories were crafted using alternate universes, that enabled many to live, in our minds and hearts, what could have been...what should have been. - I am forever grateful to AP, AL, DO, LM, and most especially JG and HL, for bringing the rough, grit, blood, bone, wet, heat and passion to those of us willing to be fed.

Lines like ""I wish I know how to quit you"" and ""I am no one, nowhere"" can be laughable and downright corny if not treated properly. Remember ""Anakin, you break my heart""?

I thought of two people deeply *deeply* in love. And the way the story plays out, it just stuns you. Now I'm not an overly emotional person. Hell, I don't give a damn about romance most of the time.

1081,dave-crm114,Competent but over-hyped,6,1 May 2006,"Well I missed it in theatres, but bought the DVD last week and watched it last night. But I seem to have missed it again. I'm really really sorry, but I found this ""masterpiece"" hugely disappointing. The acting is good in parts, particularly that of Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams as the bereft wives. Jake Gyllenhaal was a little disappointing after a magnificent turn in Donnie Darko, and although Heath Ledger is capable of excellent work I found it difficult to tell if it was just his character's emotions that were stilted, or if it were his acting as well (a tittle unkind, but how do you portray a stilted character without appearing stilted - one moment of emotional breakdown thumping a brick wall isn't enough.) Ang Lee is a very fine and exceptionally versatile director, and E. Annie Proulx a wonderful author, but nonetheless this film fell very far short of the adulation heaped on it by friends and reviewers. In fact it was ever so slightly boring, and my wife (who had also been looking forward to this) actually fell asleep towards the end.I think what it comes down to is this: it's a story about star-crossed lovers, but it's hardly Romeo and Juliet (they had feuding families and an inescapable situation to contend with.) The twist in this story is that (shock, horror) the lovers are of the same sex (I hope that doesn't count as a plot spoiler) but it's their own perversity and inability to communicate openly as much as the social mores of the time that keeps them apart and causes them to lead somewhat barren and futile lives. Their perversity and lack of ability to communicate exists just as much in their married relationships as it does in the relationship between the two - they're not fully formed men, and neither of the characters are somebody you'd want to spend your life with.And after that, so what! The story is somewhat sad but entirely predictable. SPOILERS AHEAD. I thought that the flashback treatment of the killing of Jack Twist was inept, and robbed the climax of the emotional power it could and should have had, although Ennis' discovery of the event, and the deceiving phone conversation he has with Lureen Newsome (which was interwoven with the flashbacks) was exceptional. I found the last 10 minutes and the final scenes with ""the shirt"" and Ennis' long-suffering daughter moving and uplifting - but the rest of it - Titanically pappy.Most people's reaction to the film seems to be that, gosh, it was a relationship between men that dare not speak it's name, but that's hardly a new concept, and this story doesn't have the depth and complexity of love, betrayal, and tragedy of Oscar Wilde and Lord Alfred Douglas. Get over it people, this is 2006, and although same sex relationships may cause volcanic eruptions in middle America this was a small tragedy not a great drama.",Brokeback Mountain
1082,dellamer,An Unforgettable Film!,10,3 May 2006,"Silence speaks louder than words... Love speaks louder than words ...I'm a university professor and I tend to consider myself as a rather rational-intellectual and somewhat stoic person... but then came Brokeback Mountain which caught me off guard and has generated in me unforeseen emotion.Brokeback Mountain is at once the most lyrical, powerful, inspirational, yet heart-wrenching film in a long time, without doubt one of the most important and greatest films of the last few decades. This is truly an exceptional achievement, a landmark film with an amazing story/script, outstanding and exceptional acting, masterful direction, unhurried and controlled pace, breathtaking cinematography, simple yet excellent and beautiful music, and most importantly, unprecedented emotional impact. Its treatment of human nature, loneliness, longing for love, self-repression, intolerance, is done with admirable subtlety and sensitivity. This story is simply universal. Images of this film and stirring emotions will haunt you for days and weeks. This is an extraordinary deeply moving film... simply unforgettable! Brokeback Mountain is a rare work of art in which silence speaks louder than words. Eyes and smiles can be very eloquent. Sometimes words are not necessary and are simply obstacles to the truest expression. In a very important scene in total silence near the end of the film, Ennis is alone and no word is uttered. Yet, this is surely one the most powerful and probably one of the most unforgettable scenes in recent cinematic history for its meaning and emotional impact... love speaks louder than words. Ang Lee realizes the full power of image in his exploration of the most intimate human emotions. Avoiding facile and superficial stereotypes, the great author Annie Proulx and director Ang Lee have created truer-than-life characters and, thanks of course to the unforgettable and heartbreaking performances of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, ""Ennis and Jack"" now live forever, they are now undeniably part of the American literary and cinematic culture. How many other films have accomplished this in recent years? Brokeback Mountain will remain a milestone in cinematic history and is already considered a ""reference"". This film has been talked about all over the world and has attained unprecedented internationally acclaim - the ""Brokeback phenomenon"" has significantly crossed borders and, through the media and the Internet, has reached numerous foreign countries. Rarely did a film have such a strong impact on society, in the media, and with the general public. Brokeback Mountain has undeniably been the ""Most Acclaimed and Honoured Film"" of 2005 (and, as a matter of fact, of the last decade) and will of course be remembered as ""THE"" movie-event and most important film of 2005 despite the inexplicable absence of an Oscar for Best Picture to its already impressive crown.It's sad to say, but the recent disgraceful Oscar scandal proved how ""important"" and ""necessary"" this film is, and how many boundaries there are still to be conquered. After receiving dozens of prestigious awards worldwide, Brokeback Mountain might have been too subtle, too true, simply ""too good"", for the LA-based Academy... yes, the more I think of it, the feelings expressed in BBM are probably much too sincere and too profound for the Hollywood peanut gallery who often seems to prefer car crashes, car chases, explosions, fire, violence, rape, theft, gun shots, murders, etc. In any case, the newly released DVD of Brokeback will stand as a permanent reminder of how great this film is and how unimportant, irrelevant and meaningless the Oscars and the Academy really are.Countless people from all walks of life around the world will never forget Brokeback Mountain. This film is not pushing a specific moral, instead, it makes us think, it makes us feel, it makes us reflect on the true meaning and value of our lives.If you haven't seen this film yet, get the DVD, enjoy this truly exceptional masterpiece, and ""live the Brokeback Mountain experience""!",Brokeback Mountain

The story is uncomplicated but powerful, engaging, and well written. The cast is perfect. I cannot think of two better actors that contrast yet complement each other so well. Heathe Ledger's portrayal of Ennis, the orphaned, introverted, complex, and troubled man is Oscar worthy. Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal of an open, simple, warm, loving man is Oscar worthy as well. The play between the two is the story. A little aside, if you have seen Jarhead, I think you will realize Jake is the modern ""common man""...Jimmy Stewart of the 21st Century. The cinemaphotography is stunning. It is hard to imagine more beautiful settings. The soundtrack is also excellent with a somewhat sorrowful background instrumental..I'm guessing it is original. The subject matter is I'm guessing widely known and may for some be considered controversial comes across as natural flow of the story.

I ended up crying almost all night in my bed, as I woke up I was afraid to see even the DVD cover of ""Brokeback Mountain."" Now this is The Movie...This one really speaks to you. The story touches you're heartstrings like they've never been touched before. You will ache! Do not press too much on that gay button. It isn't a gay cowboy movie(a cruel simplification), if that was what you looked for. Annie Proulx wrote thestory just about two men. Although Cowboy hats and location add a lotof magic into the film- it creates a feeling that you are exactly there in that exact time with those two men. A heart-wrenching story it is- yet so beautiful! Many say that the death of Jack was too predictable. But it doesn't matter here. ""Brokeback Mountain"" has that unique depth and above all- realism in it that all your predictions doesn't matter after all. It is more painful than you could ever predict- we try to deny the true tragedy, while it is still clearly on the screen. It's not the ending only that wrenches the heart. The WHOLE 20 YEARS of agonized love and desires which didn't come true end tragically. And now Ennis del Mar (perfectly played by Heath) still has to find strength to go on, not being able to tell anyone about his one and only true love of life, his friend, his Jack Twist. All the pain he has to bear alone! 20 years full of hopes which didn't come true-which weren't even meant to become true in reality- something that Jack and Ennis silently realize, but it doesn't make them stop hoping, it doesn't make their flourished love to be undone, it is there, when they're out on their own on the Brokeback- where they are just purely happy. All the best Jack and Ennis had was on their first time at Brokeback and they still are influenced by it for the rest of their lives, because they want it all back. What they once had becomes their only meaning and reason of existence. All the silent scenes speak to us (magic of Ang Lee), you always have to keep in the back of your head that they both are desperately longing for something, always, throughout the movie. You have to keep the unwritten laws of society always in the back of your head while watching the movie, don't forget the fact that it all was a lot harder in 1963 Wyoming, homosexuals were more isolated than they are today- it really does help you to understand the tragedy, the short-lived happiness, love which had to be hidden- had to! They couldn't do anything about it. More dramatic is that Ennis knows the reality and Jack wishes to deny it, he just... wants the tragedy to turn into ""Whiskey Springs""- it's amazing how pure Jack's wishes are. Jack and Ennis both know what miserable faith awaits them and they get more and more devastated by seeing it happen too. Two different characters- realist and the dreamer- fall for each-other, both afraid of their own sexuality. And all that Jack and Ennis wished, they just couldn't have. In the end of the movie Junior (Ennis's daughter with his divorced wife Alma) comes to tell Ennis that she's going to be married, saying that so light-heartedly and happily and you can't help but think about how different all was for her now old broken-hearted father, how difficult time he has had. Of course you would ask why Ennis ruined his life by only clinging on one man, obviously the most impossible love to have, but... Jack was all what Ennis had and all they both had was true love, that's where the whole tragedy starts to make sense- all the time they spent together Jack and Ennis both knew in the back of their heads that it's all not going to end well . I can't put it in words why I or so many other people appreciate this movie. Love is the force that can hurt us the most. Human behavior is complex as the Wyoming landscape Anne Proulx has said. The whole story is not just the story of these two men, it is a story about all things in life: pressures of society, love, hope etc. It takes two guys to show us what love is! You will be amazed how pure Jack's and Ennis's love is. It helps to go on knowing this story.This movie is honoring and representing all those untold painfully ended love-stories out there. It is full of ache, melancholy and also funny moments- exactly how I like it. It is love that we live for and only love can hurt us as much as it's shown in this movie.Last line ""Jack, I swear..."" is the best line in the history of film-making, and also the saddest. I've never seen a love-story as sad as ""Brokeback Mountain""- in my opinion the best motion picture ever made. The performances by Jake and Heath were so great that I just can't say enough to do them justice. Anne Proulx however has said the reason why the story is so popular might be that the theme of pure and powerful love shown in this story has been forgotten in our modern world.I wish there were more movies like this, but unfortunately there isn't.",Brokeback Mountain

The film is one of the most beautiful films ever made and Ang Lee was the perfect director for the movie. As he was so into minor details this really helped the film show the meaning of what the film was actually about. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal played the parts of Ennis and Jack fantastically. The film really hits you in the heart, especially if you've ever been in love. At the emotional peak of the movie I was brought to tears and I couldn't get the film out of my head for at least a few days! I would recommend the film for anyone.

I understand holding it together till I get to a safe space so I can let the sadness erupt in private. I get so many of Ennis' actions, reactions. I get both of these guys so much more now. I don't know if I experience loss these days the way I do because I saw this so many years ago and it left its mark on me, or if it's just so emotionally real for people who don't fit in quite right. I even get the wives more than I used to. I guess it's a true piece of art that you can see more as you grow and change in life. It's a deeply moving love story.",Brokeback Mountain

And it's also obvious that some of the hate is from right wing guys who are just disgusted by homosexuals.Look, there's some very basic very real problems with this movie that I don't know how you can overlook. First of all, the guys and their wives don't age. Secondly, the two men have zero chemistry on screen. Thirdly there are so many small things which make you just say ""WTF was lee thinking?"" Cutting cold turkey on thanksgiving is just one of many of these.The views and some of the cinematography are great.

I knew it was a good movie, but I couldn't begin to express its beauty and heart-wrenching poignancy in words. There are aspects to this film that only reveal themselves to you when you are alone in bed, longing for someone you can't have, or wondering about that one person you could have been so happy with. It's what made me think about the film so long after I'd watched it only once. It's what made me feel longing just hearing the melancholy twang of the guitar solo theme song. It's what made me read pages of comments about the film just to know I wasn't alone in loving the characters. The tears came only afterward. I know I will still remember the longing look in Jack's eyes and the tears Ennis produced but refused to shed for the rest of my life. That is when I realized this wasn't just a film-- it is a truly transcending love story.",Brokeback Mountain
1092,swanky7611,Solemnly moving picture,10,5 February 2006,"This movie wins in so many categories, from the cinematography, directing, story line and acting. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal capture the mood and desperation two gay men must have faced in the 1960's in desolate Wyoming.These two actors deserve such kudos for their moving, touching, sometimes gritty and absolutely believable depiction of their characters. Each character had such depth that their presence in the film seemed so real to me you could believe these two men must exist outside of this movie. It has left an impression on me that I will never forget. It is one of those films you will forever remember the day,place and time you saw it. Besides from the obvious message of when you find someone you love, don't let them go, I believe this movies biggest message is how keeping ones homosexuality a secret to the world perverts their relationships with everyone and ultimately leaves the character Heath Ledger played, isolated, alone and wondering for the rest of his life what if.",Brokeback Mountain
1093,matt-2044,Overwhelming and an absolute must see.,10,2 August 2006,"As many people have commented before about the need to talk about this film, I am sitting here, tears in my eyes not knowing how to explain how I feel.This is only the third review I have ever written for a film anywhere and am glad that there are hundreds if not thousands of others who are feeling the same way.Foe some inexplicable reason I didn't see this at the cinema but at home and in some ways I am glad as I don't believe I would have coped driving home afterwards.There is no need for the words 'I love you' to be said by either Jack or Ennis. The looks they give each other all the way through the film are heart wrenching to say the least and when Jack watches Ennis leave for what would become the last time fading to the flashback then back again - I had to stop the film to compose myself to be able to carry on watching.Throughout the film you hope with all your heart that things will turn out OK, that if they can hold on then time will allow them to be together but knowing full well that things wouldn't be OK and that the ending was not going to be happy.The two actors as has been stated countless time are indeed superb and their portrayal of Jack and Ennis are delivered with a mesmerising touch that defies belief.The way Heath Ledger portrayed Ennis and his descent into himself is masterful. His ability to show the opposites of family duty against what and whom he really wants is amazing and Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a performance that grips you and shakes you to your core.As an aside, the Academy has, I believe, made a grave error by not giving this film the Oscar for best picture. One that I think will take a long time for many to forgive.This is a film that will stay with me for a long time if not forever. The score, the scenery, the acting are all outstanding and has a depth too rarely seen nowadays in films.Thank you for bringing us a film that will stay in our hearts and minds for a very very long time.PS I believe Ennis said 'Jack, I swear...' at the end because he was making a promise to Jack to eventually get his ashes scattered on Brokeback Mountain.",Brokeback Mountain

I loved it instantly and knew it would be a film I would come back to again and again.These are characters with a love story that crawled under my skin. BBM became for me not only an iconic film and instant classic but a subconscious reference point whenever considering epic, tragic love. Every time I watch the ending I cry. The sadness of the story is so palpable and vivid with characters that feel utterly real. That Jack's death could be depicted in such a starkly distant manner, yet the simple reveal of two shirts still pack a huge emotional wallop, demonstrates the strong impression these characters leave on the viewer.Sometimes one gets despondent with the film industry as it feels there is nothing original or of interest left to be made. Most, even well received, films are instantly forgettable or a mindless distraction for a couple of hours. BBM like all truly great films is in such a different league as to seem to be an entirely separate medium! It is not only profoundly moving but has a life and spirit of its own that goes far beyond mere entertainment.BBM and the few films of its standard justify the movie industry's existence. That all films could be of such quality is an impossible ideal. That any are still made in such superficial times is something to be deeply grateful for.",Brokeback Mountain

I thought Message in a Bottle made me weep like the Willow in Fall. But My Heart Ached and Burned for the characters, the writers, the director. The countless number of people who watched as it literally changed their lives forever. It's power to make one delve deep into a hidden unscathed part of their inner most soul. It was not any one part of the film. Each and every scene, every role played, took the viewer to yet another moment of their life. I am forever grateful for Jake and Heath as I cannot see anyone else that could have done it more justice.

Like the author said, ""Heath Ledger understood his character better than I did."" When I see this movie it takes me to another world and Jake...oh, only if I was 20 years younger :) If you like this type of directing/movie format you should look into seeing Japanese anime.

It begins slow, goes in the middle slow, and outs slow, and we see a decent story unfold occasionally, but most of the time the men talk about their passion and it taking hold, etc. It is a generally safe movie, not especially creative or exciting, and it has some strong things to say, but all of these have been said and better. A few things that stuck with me: the effect their relationship had on their other family members was heartbreaking to watch, and the way that the two men split apart. Their love did not come across very well, and while the film has a lot to do about sex, it isn't all that sexy. A well done film. An occasionally heartbreaking film. But a flat and disjointed film.

I thought the idea was going to be torn apart and turned into a cliché but this was far from the truth. The characters were developed giving us a complete understanding of the reasons behind their actions and the story unfolded wonderfully. You even empathised with the character played by Michelle Williams whose distraught facial expressions painted a thousand pictures (either that or she was constipated). The film was acted superbly by the two leading roles and, although it didn't make me shed a tear, it was a mainstream movie the gay population needed people to see and understand. The idea that love is blind and even the most macho of men can find companionship in one another. My only problem with the movie was Jake Gyllenhael's moustache. What was that about?

Brilliantly adapted from a brilliant short story by Annie Proulx, Ang Lee and his cast and crew have created a landmark cinematic event like no other. This is the first movie that presents a gay love affair that seems entirely real, with no phoniness and no glossing over the physical part of the relationship. But it's not about the sex, it's about the deep love between two strong masculine men who are thwarted by things outside their control. All the cast is superb, but Heath Ledger is astonishing, giving a legendary performance - who would have thought? He's the new Brando. His minimalist performance is overwhelming and heartbreaking. Jake Gyllenahall is also amazing. Although he's overshadowed by Ledger's power, he too breaks your heart. The women are great too. You will never forget this movie.",Brokeback Mountain
1105,psheldon,"mountaintops vs. lives of quiet desperation, a heterosexual take",7,30 January 2006,"While I had no knowledge that the movie was about gay cowboys, I went to see a love story of intense romanticism which might make me cry to get me a peak experience before a great scientist spoke the next day. I am a heterosexual and struggled to find aspects of my identity portrayed in this movie. This movie wasn't sad in an inspirational sense to me as was ""Memoirs of a Geisha"". The notion of retreat into fabulous mountain scenes from a world of unfulfilling employment to just keep barely above poverty level resonated with my not wishing to lead a life of quiet desperation.It seemed to merely emphasize how obsessive passion can ruin lives. Quiet humble desperation doesn't fulfill a life either. Passion can be good, not only the passion of good ""family values"" but perhaps something a bit less localized in time, perhaps a connection to humanity not founded in genetic replication into the next generation, rather scholarship into a few generations more. Warnings against obsessive passion miss the beauty of a magnificent obsession confounding all passion in life to other than family values ""the ways of the flesh"". In my later years, I am now seeking connection or commitment to humanity in my science, perhaps with no children of my own, although children are a joy to me independent of sexual involvement with their parents. I've heard that connection to one's own offspring is intensely visceral and I may indeed be missing something as equally profound as scholarship.The movie portrays the innocent, Ennis Del Mar, as losing innocence with predatory male archetype gone awry, Jack Twist, who he, in his continued innocence, misguidedly feels somewhat sorry enough for not to break up with. Perception of any sexual overture by a male being predatory can be projected by heterosexual males onto gays with tragic results to humanity. A misunderstanding of the passions because they are unspoken can lead to bottled up pain that explodes in tragic violence. One sees the characteristic instability of three way relationships, irregardless of sexual preference, and this has been studied and verified by credible sources.Perhaps this movie speaks the bottled pain (and potential violence) of all parties to such deception.We have an unfortunate world now, a world unfortunate not only that it has predators, but also that it perhaps too easily perceives ""male behaviors"" as predatory. The movie, however, perceives Lureen Newsome as a businessman exhibiting such predatory male behaviors, a woman avoiding responsibilities with the children and predatory with a degree, at least, of owned shame.Integrating predatory and nurturing natures requires a long trek for Penguins, so for men and women of this century, probably an even longer one. I myself can't fathom it.While it seemed to simply reiterate warnings of the bible against sodomy with a beautiful musical soundtrack and mountain backdrop, there might have been another message more profound spoken by ""Ennis Del Mar"" choosing not to work but rather attend his daughters wedding which might have been, for him, another mountaintop experience, that of his daughter's unconditional love.",Brokeback Mountain
1106,anonymous1980,True to the love and go for it bravely,8,13 June 2007,"It is a pity that in the end of the movie, Jack dies and leaves Ennis alone. Even though both of them were alive, they would live a two-people life secretly in the society. We can know they love each other by their expressions. They haven't met each other for four years, but one day, Jack writes a letter to Ennis and says that he will call on him. Ennis is very happy and eager to meet with him quickly. When they meet in front of the Ennis' house, they can't help but hug tightly and kiss each other. However, it is the unnatural development among two men. It is unaccepted by the general public. But to a certain degree, they embrace and stick to their sexual orientation. After divorced with Alma, Ennis stays single. Although he meets a girl, the relationship doesn't develop further. As for Jack, he plans to divorce with Lureen and to find a place to live with the man he loves.Among the characters, I appreciate Jack the most. He has the courage to carry out his plan to live with Ennis. At first, he wants to elope with Ennis and set up a new life in another place. But, Ennis is afraid of what future this situation brings about, so he doesn't agree. He thinks there is no room around the world for two men living together. Also, Jack is true to his love, though he marries a woman as a straight man does. But he knows he wants to live with Ennis. He says that he can get money from his father-in-law by leaving Lureen. (Lureen's father is not satisfied with Jack.) To go elsewhere and live with Ennis, Jack wants to take his father's- in-law advice.It takes lots of efforts and courage to swim against the tide. They embrace their sexual orientation and face the real self. It is hard especially when you are a minority. The public look down on you and want to kill you. I also appreciate their enduring love. Because of Jack's death, Ennis doesn't forget their love. He still treasures it. I think the story encourages us to be true to the love in mind and go for it, no matter whether you are gay or straight. It is hard to predict what will happen in the future. Not until we miss him or her do we realize that he or she matters. It is too late as Ennis finds this truth in the end. He wants to swear to Jack, but no one replies because Jack is dead.",Brokeback Mountain
1107,daannzzz,"Very good movie...awesome acting....and yes, haunting",9,2 January 2006,"Spoilers! As I suspected. For those who can not get past men loving each other and more precisely, having sex, the rest of the movie will be pointless. This is a very deliberately paced movie which will also turn many people off. It was extremely nice to have the director take all the time he needed to introduce the two main characters and let their situation be visualized. Many of todays audiences will want the first 40 minutes condensed down into 5-7 minutes. This is not anything like the crop of low budget, very independent ""gay"" movies that have come out in the last decade. This is a well crafted film and reminded me of ""Days of Heaven"" Many people will wonder ""where is the love?"" forgetting that love is many things to many people and that the way, you love in your relationship is not the way it works for everyone. It took me a bit to reconcile this point but you have to keep your head routed in the time and place and, in particular with the characters. So the particular sex scene was kind of a shock to me , but after thinking about it, it made sense. This is not an easy movie everything laid out. There are points that may or may not seem right to you that will come clear later or after you have stewed on it for a while. Or maybe they won't. There are many who complain of the death in the movie. It has been the bane of gay stories, over the past many decades, that someone always has to die. That has been clearing up lately with lots of fresh, breezy, pleasant ""gay"" films ...which is wonderful. This is not that kind of film. The old convention of death shows up but it is the way this film works. I have read many reviews from people (mostly young gay men) who said that it was a bad story because the two men didn't have the courage to live together in love. That is not the story being told. Write your own script. Yes this was a sad movie and I did cry though not so much (as I expected) at the very end as in other emotional scenes as well as one small spot at the beginning. The photography is beautiful as is the score. This is a realistic movie. You will find , maybe two lines in the film, to give you a chuckle, otherwise there are no one liners tossed in every few minutes to relieve the tension or remind you that you are watching a film. There are no gratuitous, unbelievable action sequences, there are no car chases or extreme violence (except for one or two flashes) or steamy erotic sex scenes, nothing that is there to wink at the audience or remind you you are sitting in a theater. Jake Gyllenhaal was very good. Not having seen him in much I did suspect he was a good actor, His character is the more fun pleasant one and, as such, seemed less of a challenge but he has some really, really good moments. I had heard Heath Leger's name over the years but have never seen him in anything and figure he was as portrayed by the media, a cute semi leading man passing through. He certainly busted up into the top level of actors on my list. I have know guys like this. Didn't know who Michelle Williams was either. Excellent acting in a small part. I know many people thought the movie was too long. I wanted a bit more. More of their lives in the last half hour. More about the wives and children but then I suppose it would have been a mini series! You can never please everyone, Many of the reviews I have read are 10 stars (many people gushing on and on) or one star. It is fine to give it 10 stars if you felt that way. Many of the one star ""reviews"" were from people (mostly men) who, as said above and previously, can not get past the gay part of the movie and do not ever see the film. Most of the other half of the one star reviews seem to be from gay men who wanted a fuzzy Hollywood romance about men coming out and starting a ranch and or moving to California or New York, which would be fine as a story but it isn't this story...or they wanted to see more sex, affection and such and that was all they wanted in the movie. There are very few average or bad reviews that actually review the film honestly. I don't know if it is the best film of the year, it is very good but I really like ""Crash"" too. I do think that Heath Leger's performance is one of the best in many years. Go see it and let it sink in. You may or may not like it but that is what films are about.",Brokeback Mountain
1108,dannyboy43,"""A Truly Grounbreaking Film For Understanding of Love Between Two Human Beings""",10,1 January 2006,"I saw this film with friends, both straight and gay. I saw myself up on the screen for the first time in my 62 years of living. What a great feeling. While gays have been portrayed in many films over the years for many years and in very positive ways, this is the first time I have seen a real love story. By having its origin begin in 1963, six years before the Stonewall Riots in New York City - a cosmopolitan, sophisticated city even then it structures the turmoil these two men faced between each other and even more powerful from society. Both Ennis and Jack mirror some of my life (and I'm sure many other gays). Back then many of us had no role models for what it was to realize this attraction in our early teens. Many of us just kept it hidden and sometimes discovered this attraction in the same manner as Jack and Ennis, often stating the same ruse of denial after such and encounter. Oh, do I remember!!! I am out now. This film is so well done on so many levels. First the setting is so stark. Gays exist in the hinterlands, what a surprise!!!...they just up and move to the accepting cities, or at least where they can blend into the surroundings. The non-stereotypical ( by the media's standards, not mine) men in the film are brilliantly acted. Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger are both to be commended for their portrayals - equally. I only hope that both get recognized for their quite truthfully perfect acting performances. The rest of the cast members, Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway, are also to be commended as are Larry McMurtry and Dianna Osanna for their screenplay and Ang Lee for his direction. I have just read the short story and must note that much of Annie Proulx's prose in the book are adapted verbatim in the screenplay.

1109,Risico,Are you being fair to Ennis & Jack?,10,3 July 2006,"I have no qualms with any of the ""10 star"" marks on this review section  as you can see I have given this film the maximum it can be awarded too.However  The great majority of you, perhaps all of you, seem to be missing the point of the film  and in the meantime are doing a great disservice to Ennis and Jack.""This IS the gay cowboy film""  in fact the film is, in its entirety, about the uniquely gay phenomenon of ""the closet"".On Brokeback Mountain the guys are free, in nature  ie naturally, to express their feelings freely for each other unhindered and unseen. Hence we have massive open spaces, expansive skies (in total contrast to the claustrophobic atmosphere and spaces in Riverton and Childress). Yet even during these halcyon times we have events trying to drive both (yes both) back into the closet  the dead sheep is, for example, the reminder to Ennis of the neglect of his job; the first victim of their relationship; or, if you like, the sacrificial lamb on the altar of Ennis' sin. You can take your pick  yet all are designed to drive Ennis back deep within himself where he has been since birth.It is clear that, unnecessarily, like some gay men, Ennis has hated himself since childhood. You can see it in the way he walks  you can hear it in the way he talks. He CAN understand the feelings he is having, he has had them all his life, though he has always feared to express them until his sojourn on Brokeback: it is his father who, tragically, unknowingly and only in a loving effort to protect his sons, imprisons Ennis into ""the closet"" for what can only can be guessed at is the remainder of his life. Jack is, simply, the more known case of the closet  at the right time he'll just walk out  he just needs the right guy! All the turbulent relationships outside of the central relationship (other than mother/son-father/daughter) are by-products of both of the lads living their lives in ""the closet"".It is not important how Jack died, what is important is how Ennis believes it happened. Ennis picks the outcome that totally justifies his fears and the one that will secure him within his own closet.Finally we have, to all intense and purposes, the two final, and most important, scenes of the film. Both have, literal ""CLOSETS"" central within them (Ennis finds shirts in Jack's closet; Ennis places daughter's jumper in his closet). The window at the end showing wide, open fields (what might have been) that is in total contrast to the existing closeted confines of Ennis' caravan.If further tragedy was needed it is the people who matter most to the two central characters  Ennis' daughter and Jack's mother  who knew that they both were gay, all along, (Alma Jnr: ""You're good enough"") and are there to understand and pick up the pieces at the end.Ennis only realises, too late, that love in the end is all that matters: "" This Kurt, does he love you?"" and finally releases one of the greatest final lines in a film  ""Jack I swear .."" Of course it's ""Jack I swear I love you"" but like Ennis' life the sentence remains incomplete.The genius of Brokeback Mountain is not that it is a universal love story that just happens to contain gay characters but that it is, uniquely, a gay love story that has been made to appeal universally. However seeing this film as the former can only, in my opinion, be driving the lads back into that closet.",Brokeback Mountain
1110,dean-452,Indescribable,10,7 July 2007,"This movie is about friendship, love, loneliness, defeat, hope, renewal, caring, trust and perhaps, the most gut-wrenching is the fact that the characters acting it out want to run away from all of these emotions but can't. Straight or gay if you can watch this movie without something moving you - check yourself for a pulse. Interesting the song that Jake dances to with his 'wife' is 'No one is going to love you like me.' Stong, powerful, sad, exciting....well, I could go on and on with adjectives but I can't aptly describe it. There was one scene (while Ang tried to do it respectfully) that didn't need to be in the movie BUT it was all a part of it and no parts can be taken from this film. I added the spoiler comment to be safe but I don't believe I really gave anything away and if you have not seen this movie yet, trust me, you owe it to yourself. I sat with a mixed crowd, men and women that is, and it seemed no one could even speak after the viewing. They were not appalled just moved to the point of silence. Watch it and tell me differently if you like. Wonderfully acted, directed and filmed - this one will go down in history!!",Brokeback Mountain

But Best Picture nominations and awards? I don't know if it deserved them.The movie reminded me of a very well-made Lifetime movie. I really just didn't find it particularly good, and I think the only reason it won awards and was highly praised is because it was about homosexuals. People thought that was going to turn off the majority to seeing it, but instead it just hyped it up so people who wouldn't normally have seen it wanted to see it to see what it was all about.Eh, nothing special. Breakthrough movie? Not sure about that. Maybe they'll be more gay themed movies, but who knows. In any case, not a whole lot of substance here. I was somewhat surprised that Crash won the Best Picture Oscar -- while it was a dang fine movie, I thought that Brokeback had it in the bag.

1112,amanda0852,A Wonderful Movie,10,25 April 2006,"Brokeback Mountain is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The acting is wonderful, the direction is without parallel, and the setting is sublime. I wasn't a particular Heath Ledger fan before, but I sure am now ... and Jake Gyllenhal is a wonder, too. I'd recommend everyone see this movie, but it is quite sad, so depressives be warned.I've read the short story upon which the film is based, and that the writers (Larry McMurtry & Diana Ossana) managed to turn it into this beautiful film is amazing. They certainly deserved their Oscar!Ang Lee paces the story slowly at first, so you can get to know the characters, how they think, how their relationship forms; he catches you up in the joy AND heartbreak of their lives, and in the profound impact their connection has on others. And he does it with a wonderful subtlety; it must have been an amazing experience for all of the actors involved with this movie, to work with someone so talented and with such heart for the material.

1114,laxdoctor,Not a gay cowboy film; it's much grander than that.,10,8 February 2006,"When I read the Lee Harris review excerpted below I thought, ""Yes! That is the problem with the 'gay cowboy'characterization of this film. It's too narrow, too limiting. These guys act, talk and live more like me and most of my male friends (except that we don't have sex with each other) than my gay friends act, talk and live (except that they do have sex with each other)."" Ennis and Jack do not fit any convenient label and cannot be defined by their sexual life. This will anger some men who identify themselves as gay and want to appropriate Ennis and Jack as ""our people because they have sex with each other"" as well as some men who identify themselves as straight and want to see Ennis and Jack as ""not like us because they have sex with each other"". All I know is that I don't have sex with men, but Ennis and Jack sure seem like ""one of us"" to me. If this film fosters that awareness, I think it would do a whole lot for the cause of tolerance.This film is about two men who cannot and will not be defined by what they do sexually. At last, a film which doesn't try to define complex human beings as ""gay"" or ""straight"" or the equally vapid ""bisexual"".These fully developed human characters get thrown together, develop an emotional connection, spontaneously have drunken sex and then fall in love, but never want to be anything other than who they are -- cowboys. They're not gay men who are forced to marry and have kids by a straight-dominated culture. They get married and have kids because that's also part of their nature. That's what makes this a tragedy in the classic sense of the word. Their circumstances and internal conflicts lead them to an inevitable doom and it's one full of poignancy, one worth grieving. Can we please stop trivializing them by trying opportunistically to co-opt them as one-dimensional poster boys for gay liberation or as the focus of hatred for the anti-homosexual backlash, and just see them as the richly human characters that they are as portrayed on the screen??? I'm just grateful that Ang Lee took this amazing story and made it even better on screen, and that he and all of his actors did so with such devotion, empathy and skill. If this film doesn't break your heart in the most beautiful way, I don't know what would.Excerpts from Lee Harris:Though it is often spoken of as a love story between two gay cowboys, it isn't really that at all. It is a love story between two ""homophobic"" men -- two genuinely macho guys who felt visceral revulsion at everything that our culture has come to associate with the word gay. Who ""forced"" the two cowboys into ""normal"" marriage? And what power forced them to remain in the closet and told them that they had to stay in Wyoming and Texas? On the day after the two young men first have sex with each other, on the slopes of Brokeback Mountain, they have an exchange in which both emphatically deny that they are homosexual. One of the characters, Ennis del Mar, remains completely faithful to the other; the other, Jack Twist, when he seeks homosexual release, does not go to an American gay bar, but crosses the border to pick up a straight Mexican hustler. The last thing he is looking for is a gay man. Nothing could be more foreign to them than what is now called gay culture. The poignancy of their story lies precisely in the fact that neither of the two heroes can escape by this route. That is the reason Brokeback Mountain looms so expressively throughout the movie -- it is the only place where they can love each other and still remain men in their own eyes. To come down from the mountain, and settle down into gay domesticity is not an option for them, because it would rob them of their dignity as men. Their only escape was to return to the isolation of the mountain, where, by themselves, they could achieve what even the most gay tolerant society could not give them -- a sense of manliness. Ennis and Jack certainly knew they loved each other passionately. Yet both of them were equally convinced that,despite their love, they were normal guys. Their resistance to being labeled was the noblest expression of human dignity: the refusal to let others treat us as things. All that they knew, all that they could be comfortable with, was the world of normal guys. It was where they belonged, and it was where they were at home. It was only on Brokeback Mountain that they could love each other passionately and still hold up their heads like men. Yet this was precisely the source of the tragic dimension of the story. Brokeback Mountain was not a life, but an escape from life. It could never become for them a permanent place of abode. Both of the cowboys were heroic enough to keep their love for each other alive over the course of two decades, but it was a love that could only find fulfillment when they had left the world behind and had ascended to the isolation and seclusion of the mountain. Thus their rebellion against the way of the world ended as all such rebellions end -- in the inevitable defeat of the rebels and the victory of the world. There was no other outcome to the story that was possible.Brokeback Mountain is a genuine work of art, and not a piece of propaganda, however well-intentioned.",Brokeback Mountain
1115,tmdoh,Just beautiful,10,11 May 2008,"Beautiful, haunting, breathtaking - these are words that have over and over again been used to describe this unique love story... and all of them are justified.The tragic story of a rodeo rider and a cattle ranch hand succeeds when you realise that this is purely, a love story. A story which could have been told at any time in history between any two people - a simple, sad, ultimately tragic love story.It may be in fact, the saddest movie I have ever seen. The final scenes of the movie really only added to a series of situations where all of the characters endured sadness.The pain Heath Ledger portrays when he realises what has happened to Jack Twist is unforgettable and for me is such a reminder of the mindlessness of judgements within society - homophobic, racial or otherwise. Pain is pain, no matter who you are.",Brokeback Mountain
1116,sunshowers,"Devastatingly beautiful and true, a must-see for all mankind",10,15 November 2008,"Jack and Ennis... two young ranch hands, used to hard living and going nowhere fast, take jobs tending sheep on Brokeback Mountain one summer. What results of their partnership is not something that either of them expected, but their fall into lust and then love changes the course of their lives irrevocably. Their story has the power to change your life too.It's easy to label this film as ""the gay cowboy movie."" Though the fact of their sexuality is what drives the plot, creating obstacles and heartbreak throughout Jack and Ennis's lives, it is not the central theme here. To box this story up as a tearjerker about marginalized minorities is a frustrating oversimplification, and more importantly, it is a serious misapprehension of the sheer scope of this film.No, this film is about love, longing, and bitter regret. It is a universal affirmation that no matter how hard it is, love is the only thing that life is worth living for. It is both a plea and a warning to those who may realize this truth too late. This is a film that absolutely shattered me, but I came out of it with the knowledge that the only way to live is to love fearlessly and without hesitation. Years later, I still count this as one of the greatest lessons I've ever learned.How some people could completely miss the point of the story is something that really bothered me for a long time, until I watched it with a certain friend of mine. She is, to put it bluntly, childishly naive and had never known romantic love. When the movie ended, she remarked rather lightly, ""Oh it's so sad that they couldn't be together because they were gay."" So perhaps it's necessary to have some life experience as a context for this story... and no movie, no matter how amazing, can teach you what true love feels like (however, anyone who has ever been in love already knows the pain of heartbreak, even if their hearts have yet to be broken).Ang Lee is an artist, a maestro, a wizard in the way he creates this world for his characters. It is a world that is simultaneously intimate and desolately vast, and Lee doesn't miss a single detail. You don't just see the landscape, you feel the wind howling through your bones. This is all the more remarkable considering how foreign the ranch life in 1970's Wyoming must be to a man who grew up in a big city in Taiwan. Somehow he knows this place as if he'd lived there all along.I suppose it helps that he had utter faith in his actors. I firmly believe that no two others could have done it - the chemistry between the two leads is electric. Jake Gyllenhaal is perfectly lovable as the boisterous yet sensitive Jack, buoyant and optimistic despite the many harsh blows that life has dealt him, and he deserves utmost praise. However, critics couldn't help but overlook him in the face of Heath Ledger's tour de force performance as Ennis Del Mar, a man whose emotions are so repressed that the weight of them is evident in every motion. The difference between the two performances is that Ledger's Ennis becomes a real person. He so completely submerges himself in the role that you no longer see Heath Ledger acting as Ennis, but Ennis come to life.The supporting cast is no less impressive than the leads. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway play the wives of Ennis and Jack respectively, whose own lives become lies through the deceit of their husbands. The story doesn't gloss over their anger and grief, and these very young actresses give performances that are far beyond their years. The actress who plays Jack's mother also stands out to me. In a pivotal scene near the end where so many questions are answered, and all these answers are conveyed between the lines, it's as if she and Ledger are speaking directly to your heart.Finally, I highly recommend that you read the short story by Annie Proulx after seeing the film. You will be all the more impressed by how well Proulx's spare, honest prose was adapted to the big screen.",Brokeback Mountain

Basically this film is an excuse for two men to have it their way on a mountain and women to be treated badly because they are ""men""..I don't care if the men are sleeping with each other or with women it is yet again a fairly shallow excuse for men to treat women badly.The men depicted in this movie are self centered,selfish and shallow.I don't care if they are gay or not,I have many gay friends..but I do care that yet once again we women are treated in a demeaning light on camera with men not being held accountable for their actions.Grow up you young short self indulgent narrow minded male studio execs.I do give the film credit for a Stunning Location,Stunning Cinematogropahy,Smooth Poetic Directing and Good Production Design(and muisc was adequate).I cannot credit anything else including the story and inspid performances by the women,and the verging on violent acting by the men.BORING.

The love and emotional support that Jack offers cannot overcome the constant need for basic, physical necessities which dogs Ennis throughout his adult life. So the fact that their love survives in this constrained environment is amazing... to say nothing of the external caustic environment of the times that finally takes Jack away from Ennis. I think Jack and Ennis could have survived in a ""you and me against the world"" scenario, but they could not overcome the poverty trap in which Ennis was caught in order to risk taking on the world together.The emotional impoverishment of Ennis' youth is also reflected in the way he treats his wife and children, exasperated by his conflicted longing for Jack.

So much was said when so little was spoken in the movie between the leading characters.I left the theater feeling numb but all ranges of emotions gradually came to me that how the characters were so repressed and restricted, could never fully express it.With the breathtaking natural sceneries of Wyoming, love happened and was expressed in the most natural way between two human beings. However with social value and the so called To the lead characters and everyone around them, it became a burden and deep sadness because of love.Even until the very end, when the simplest human needs is to be with the person you love, it's so clear and close but yet so far, that so many obstacles were in the way. Eventfully through the complexity of our society and life, all you can hold on to is pieces of the past, knowing something was once there so naturally and magnificently, where the world was all yours even in the tiniest tent, once in ""Brokeback Mountain"".",Brokeback Mountain

Still two days later, the film has stayed with me and I am struck with how much I am thinking about it, more than most any film I've ever seen.Since the screening I have engorged myself with all the user comments and reviews I can get hold of to see what impact it is having and trying to sort out my feelings on it. Although I don't have a similar ""brokeback"" experience in my past, as a gay man, I am gratified to see the story told in such a sensitive and ""real"" way.This film was extremely well done and deserves any Oscar nominations it gets.My only beef with it is after the ""sex"" scene on the mountain, I didn't get the falling in love part that continues four years later and then on ""fishing"" trips after that. Somehow I didn't see how the connection that was made on the mountain progressed from mere horseplay and camaraderie to out and out forbidden love. I would have liked to see more of how that happened.Maybe it's more realistic to understand that there would not have been a lot of additional verbalizing, but still I was left making that leap of faith instead of seeing and believing it on the screen.Two scenes stand out in my mind as most poignant. One was Alma's reaction to accidentally seeing her husband and Jack together in the stairwell. What a punch in the gut and you just feel for her and what it must have meant in that place and time.The second was at the end when Ennis visits Jack's parents. It was so achingly well done, memorable as much for what was not said as much as for what was.I can't ever remember going to see a movie more than once, but I probably will do so here. It has captivated me.Kudos and thanks to Ang Lee, and the whole cast for making such a riveting and important work.",Brokeback Mountain

The main point, however, relates do Jack's death. As far as I could understand - and directors says so - Jack was murdered. This agrees with his beliefs, his trips to Mexico.... and the story his wife tells Ennis it's not true... Thus, death of Jack is not on Ennis's mind (as his father showed him)- but in reality....By other side, I was confused with Jack's statement about a ""bone disease"" (portugues version).... IMHO, this should relates with Jack's promiscuous behaviour (in Mexico).

It's a fairly pedestrian tale, slow moving, a little tedious and nothing really happens in a story that spans several years. Even the scenery was hardly breathtaking. Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger serve as the ""eye candy"" for both sexes I guess but they mumble their way through the dialogue which makes it difficult to hear sometimes. Heath is the main mumbling culprit. However I didn't care about the characters, not even their wives and families.

It is beautiful to look at and emotionally wrenching. The relationship between Ennis and Jack is realised superbly and it is very moving to see how it develops over the years. Whilst the film articulates what was probably a reality for some men defined as cowboys I wouldn't describe this as a gay movie. It is a film about relationships and the importance of sustaining those you love. Within the particular times and circumstances these two men manage with difficulty to sustain their relationship against the odds for a long time. It is very clear that they live within a violently homophobic culture, unfortunately a culture that still exists in various places throughout the world, and for me that is one of the strengths of the film that we see so clearly how hard it is for these men to express their feelings to each other let alone anyone else that are involved with.

1128,phantombnz,Brokeback fails to deliver,7,8 March 2006,"I couldn't help but go into this movie with a certain amount of expectation. Had it been robbed? Would all the fuss be worth it? Having said that, I don't remember the last time I watched a Western on the big screen so it was all fresh anyway. What struck me initially was the emptiness on screen. Ang Lee has very much gone for a ""beautiful vista"" approach with more scenery shots than Lord of the Rings. That's not necessarily a bad thing...although 15 minutes of sheep being herded through various terrain got a little tiresome. There's a lot of unspoken action in this film. Much of the love story has to be assumed by the viewer; the short scenes inherent in bonding tales such as this are all there but there's no real suggestion of l'amour afoot. That is until the first spontaneous ""entanglement"", which comes across more as an avenue for pent-up sexual frustration. What confuses further is the establishment on both sides of wives and children, setting up the big area of conflict in the respective cowboy's individual lives. Ang Lee has presented a good film....but is it an Oscar-winning film? Not in my books. There's some good acting here....but it's spate of acting nominations is beyond me. Michelle Williams has little to do and while Heath Ledger's stony faced mumbling is admirably subtle throughout, he was far more powerful as a ""Southern Boy"" in Monster's Ball - another ""relationship taboo"" film far more powerful than this.I have yet to see Crash, but to be brutally honest, it wouldn't take much to top this.",Brokeback Mountain
1129,huggs5,"I'm sorry, honestly I am",4,25 June 2012,"So... basically I came into this movie going 'OK, I've been putting this off for months and months and months... here goes' I got it about three months ago and it's been sitting on my hard drive since then.It opened and I giggled at the eyes Jack was making at Ennis, OK, so I already kinda knew what was going to happen between them. Hence the giggling. Then they took the job, OK, it's all going along fine. There's a few days, a few more days, the only significant thing in there is the bear and when Jack tried to patch him up. Obviously Ennis wasn't comfortable with that. OK. So I was kinda trying to figure out how the hell they end up together. It got cold. Ennis ended up in the tent. OK. I was expecting some heartfelt clichéd dialogue. Instead Jack took Ennis's hand and then WABANG awkward, ungraceful and unbelievable sex scene. It ended fast. OK. I was a little confused about HOW and WHY Ennis quite literally JUMPED on top of him when he had never shown Jack any affection or anything before. I guess he could have just been like 'hey, what the flip is going on here I don't understand, I'm not going to do anything OK. Just in case he's not the same way inclined' So... I sort of don't quite grasp the concept.Then the Cop saw them wrestling shirtless which was adorable. And then he left. OK. Maybe the cop doesn't care really.So they got called back and then we followed their lives. The first time they got back together and they were kissing outside of the front door of the house and Alma saw them. I was expecting more of a reaction from her. Maybe a 'get out rawr' thing. Then I never understood after that why she actually stayed with him if she was so thingy about that.After that I started to get a bit bored with the huge gaps between action, there wasn't a lot of character development over that time, I thought that perhaps Ennis would fall into alcoholism and Jack would continue with his trips to Mexico. Apparently not.Honestly, by the end of the movie I had finally sort of gotten what I wanted, a break down. I mean, you can't go twenty years with this forbidden love and not have moments between each other like that where everything just completely falls apart. Which brings me to -there was simply not enough scenes between both of them. There was a lot of scenes through out their lives... but not enough between them. And the story is between them. I see how they've conveyed the gaps of nothing between the two by having no action, but it didn't quite have the desired effect. To me it didn't anyway.Going quickly back to the breakdowns. I feel that that was the only moment in the movie where heterosexuality ebbed slightly, the entire movie was far too straight for a film about gay love. They should have talked more, talked more about their lives with their wives, their kids. Talking about that stuff is what people do! But we never got the look in for it.The ending... I don't think it was quite powerful enough. The phone call, it was blunt and I don't think there was enough dialogue from Ennis to make it work properly. After that I sort of half expected him to fall over and stop. Because we never got that. When he found the shirts, (AHA I KNEW JACK HAD TAKEN THE SHIRT!) I was seriously expecting something better than just picking it up and taking it. When he saw Alma Jr. I was creating dialogue of my own, some of his thoughts, 'Everyone is getting married around me, why could I never?' because those thoughts cross mine as well when I find out that people around me are getting married and knowing that I'll never be able to get a proper marriage. Then she forgot her jumper and he put it in the cupboard.So... all in all... I honestly expected more from this. I watched it going in to think that this is supposed to be better than a movie I watched the other day called 'Weekend' (awesome movie about gay love) and I would take Weekend over this any day.Four because I loved the scenery and the camera man did a wonderful job, regarding and disregarding all the boring scenes and putting a ratio on the good and the bad... the bad won a little.

But if you think this is it, you are then missing the whole point!!! Why are so many people saying so many similar things? Maybe because this movie is so superlatively deeply touching, intense, heart-breaking and haunting, that in a way it looks like it has been bringing a kind of dormant and unusual humanity and perception to the surface, like you're coming back to life, the real one this time, for many people. People watch this movie and they end up in total awe and numb for what they have seen, most of us still trying to digest the ""volcano"" of deep hardcore emotions that it has provoked on us. It's like for the first time we have been exposed to a different and completely new way of seeing love, of seeing life, of seeing humanity, a way none of us ever imagined existed or would be possible... in a simple movie. Absolutely needless to mention how all the people involved in the production certainly got to transcend themselves to a higher level here, any adjective I might try to use would not be able to appropriately express how splendid everything became. Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography, Score, Acting - well, this last one certainly deserves another superlative adjective that may have not been created yet - the main cast was simply out of this world, undeniably believable and realistic in every way.Here is another aspect that the movie was absolutely superb in - most of what it conveyed could not simply be expressed with words - and it actually wasn't!!!!! Most of it goes silently and unspoken into the audience's heart, unwillingly, subtly, without warning... and when you become aware of what's going on with you, it's too late. You're already way too involved, astonishingly numb and trapped in a dialog the movie produces between the characters' lives and pain and your true self...Now, there's no way out for you!!!! It's like now this movie has created a direct interface with your heart and spirit... something your conscious reason cannot control anymore. Maybe this is the reason you cannot simply go on with your normal lives, after having simply watched another great movie. It goes on with you, you go bed, trying to sleep, but it's still there, making you think, images and striking feelings coming back to your mind over and over, forcing you to try to reason or understand something that maybe is still out of our reach. We have have all been raised within a cultural context that both shapes us and is reciprocally shaped by us. We tend to try to give names and label everything we touch, everything we come in contact with. But maybe we are starting to realize that this rationalism and materialism we have been used to may not be enough to give us even a glance of who we really are, or what we are really supposed to do in this life on our precious third rock from the sun. This movie gets all the point here. It is indeed able to show us a sight of a kind of humanity, with such raw honesty, it gives us a glance of what our world might be if not for all the labels, all the repression, all the control we try to have on others. Like many people have said, even though we all know it is a story between two men here, that is NOT what OUR HEARTS actually see, we REALLY see two human beings, two spirits that are bound to go together, no matter what gender they are, no matter what society might think of them, no matter how each and all of us would label them, it is still there - the only concrete thing, the love they feel for each other, pure love, raw love, love that comes from deep beyond the heart itself, love that comes straight from the PRIMEVAL fire of the spirit. Love that is above anything. Anything AT ALL. Love so pure, so complete, that it cannot be judged by societal, cultural and material standards. Maybe this movie might help us take a glance at a new reality, a new kind of bonding for mankind, a bond that might be based on new standards. All in all, like many others, I have been haunted by this movie since I saw it the first time, I cannot simply get it out of my mind!!! Every now and then I catch myself wondering on one or another aspect of what I saw, new ideas coming to my mind, and still sometimes tears come to my eyes when a scene or another comes back to my focus of attention. So, I also decided to share my experience with you. I hope I can enlighten you somehow with my own impressions... I truly believe this movie is already a landmark in the history of the cinema, but maybe it has not revealed itself to us completely. Maybe we are yet to come to a final objective conclusion and understanding of what this turmoil is all about. The experience of this movie only starts on the screen, believe me... Nothing you can do will prevent it from bringing the storm and the bliss directly into your own heart and spirit. Totally unique. A masterpiece. Now, forget all I have just said and go experience it for yourself (if you haven't already). It can only be IF it is a personal emotional and spiritual journey. It's like in the ""Matrix"", you have to make your choice and take the pill yourself to get to know the true meaning of things.",Brokeback Mountain
1131,n-purdon,Ang Lee and Heath Ledger's innovation,10,14 January 2006,"Ang Lee is one of the greatest chameleons working in cinema. He can take any genre from martial arts to melodrama and change it forever. His command of period and landscape is equally meticulous,whether it's Qing China,Jane Austen's parks or downtown Manhattan. With 'Brokeback Mountain' he does the same for the iconic genre of Hollywood cinema,the Western. With his almost anthropological eye he sweeps away the narrative of Manifest Destiny ,and replaces it with an epic love story which maintains the setting but creates a new world.Other directors from Ford and Stevens to Eastwood and the Coen brothers have done this by incorporating innovative discourses,for example on Native Americans or women.Others have mixed the 1880s drive to the west with later periods or elements from film noir. But Lee has made a change which tops them all. By concentrating on characters who have previously appeared only by inference,and making it clear that he is dealing with a genuine sexual love between two men, he has made a Big Sky mountain of his own. The actors,especially Heath Ledger as Ennis,are brilliantly portrayed with the gestures and scenery commenting on what's left unsaid.Would-be banners or censors are going to look historically retarded,since this is one of the films of the epoch.",Brokeback Mountain
1132,LETJones,"Saddlesore, blood and whisky",10,18 January 2006,"The acting performances in Brokeback are exemplary. It's sedately scripted, subtle in its suggestions and captivating throughout. Fantastic emotion from Gyllenhaal unlike any I've seen on film. A truly believable pleasure. The power of the scenery and the meaning behind the mountain provide us with an emotional wreckage of thoughts as we share their experieneces. Michelle Williams gave an outstanding performance. Their relationship is universal, the joy, pain and suffering through repression is shocking and helps us realise how far we've come in our ideals and society. Love is love and it is told plainly here.",Brokeback Mountain

And it still hurts to have to pretend we don't! Heath and Jake are breathtaking - it wont take you but a minute to get past their stardom and believe that they are really in love, I think they BOTH deserve Best Oscar nominations - In fact - I hope it wins EVERY Oscar there is!See this movie - hug the man next to you and go get a cup of coffee!

1134,neecheecat,Amazing,10,31 December 2005,"This a a great return to form for Ang Lee after the action extravaganzas of crouching tiger and the hulk, and a welcome return at that. The script, acting, cinematography and the mature approach as to which its unnecessarily controversial subject matter is tackled are all perfect. its just such a shame that the subject matter will put so many people off going to see this movie. But then again those choosing not to go and see it simply based on the subject matter would obviously choose to take their moral high ground and criticise based on that. So maybe its best they go see Narnia instead...Heath Ledger in his first real break through performance shows that he is an actor way beyond my expectations and surely on his way to greatness. Jake Gyllenhaal is also extremely endearing as the more sympathetic of the two. Both Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams put in fine supporting performances and should hopefully be able to leave their princess diaries/Dawson's creek past behind them and move on successfully to more challenging and adult roles.Overall one of the best films that I have seen this year, a must for any true film fan.Go to www.guardian.co.uk and read their 'Way Out West' article on gay cowboys, its very interesting :)",Brokeback Mountain
1135,coolcalm02,Brilliant FIlm! One of the Best of 2005!!!,10,25 December 2005,"It is a clichè that there can never be anymore original stories. And because that has a lot of truth to it, finding an original WAY to tell that story is important. Romances have also become a clichè, the same stories being told over and over again. BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN basically tells that same story but in the most crafty, clever way that I've seen in a LONG time.The film is superbly directed by Ang Lee (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon), who gives one of (if not THE) Best directing jobs of this (or last) year. Brokeback Mountain, written for the screen by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana and based on a short story by novelist Annie Proulx, follows two cowboys who meet in the early '60's while herding sheep on the titular mountain. They form what they think is just a sexual bond, but when they reunite four years later, after they both separately married and had kids, they discover that the feelings that they have go far deeper. The film is simple and the pace is deliberate, taking its time to develop the relationship between these two men, discovering their deep emotional love, but doesn't handle it to the point of corniness. Lee's directing is curious, peeking at these characters but not getting too close, letting the actors bring the characters to life and push the story along. His approach is laced with subtleties, which I love to see in a director's work, making simple things like the twitch of an eye, a slight glance, or a smile or frown speak volumes.This approach can also be seen in the fabulous photography by acclaimed Mexican D.P. Rodrigo Prieto (21 Grams, 8 Mile, 25th Hour). Aside from his beautiful landscape photography of the Midwest mountains and plains and his stunningly realistic firelight and moonlight sequences, his trademark mix of different film stocks is used to touching effect here. The different textures that he lays throughout the picture captures the emotional arc and different worlds of the two characters. And probably the most noticeable achievement is the amazing acting by the ENTIRE cast. Michelle Williams plays the shattered wife of Ennis with an intense sadness, but of course it is the two leads, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, that ultimately carries the picture. Ledger (Williams's real-life girlfriend), in what is undoubtedly his greatest performance, is brooding as Ennis Del Mar, torn between his feelings for Jack and his fear of others finding out about them and what might happen in consequence. And Gyllenhaal, right off his career-topping performance in Jarhead, is equally great here, playing Jack Twist, the cowboy/rodeo man, who's immense frustration at not be able to be as close as he wants to be with Ennis, seems to slowly consume him. But this frustration seems never to lessen his love for Ennis, lighting up with great joy at each sight of him. And rising composer Gustavo Santaolalla (The Motorcycle Diaries, North Country) laces the film with a beautiful, romantic, award-worthy acoustic guitar score, that sports heartbreaking nostalgia.Throughout the film, you realize that Brokeback Mountain is not just the title, not just a place, but a symbol of a deep yearning for love, a love that is so close but still ultimately unattainable; something that probably anyone can relate to. Brokeback Mountain is doing very well in the precursors of this award season, and it deserves all the attention its getting. Please, go out and support this beautiful picture. They hardly make them like this anymore.",Brokeback Mountain

Upon second viewings, it's now one of my favorite films. I was afraid that I would get the same reaction from Brokeback. Luckily, i realize as i sit here trying to hold back the tears from a movie that ended 30 mins ago, it didn't happen. Instead i get a movie where i'm able to connect with both Jake and Heath: their quietness, their love, his unwillingness to go for what he really wants, and i'm scared. Scared that i see so much of myself in Ennis that i'll end up just like him. It scares me. Only two films have made me cry, this one and The Laramie Project. Both have effected me in different ways. The latter helped me get out of my bubble and get more involved. The former made me realize that i may never escape that bubble, destined to be alone never truly getting what i want.

But what about the story? I imagine that Americans are not used to films about the love between two men, but in Europe and especially in the Netherlands it's no big deal at all. If these so-called controversial aspects are set aside the entire film is in my opinion nothing more than a fairly one-dimensional story. The are no - or hardly any - changes in plot, the characters remain gloomy from the beginning tot the end. There are no surprises whatsoever. From the beginning the viewer knows that the love between the two is doomed. And that's it mainly. A good movie, but not a master peace. So it will win a lot of Oscars!Wim Kunst, Assen (The Netherlands)",Brokeback Mountain

1140,lukyallan,May contain spoilers,10,17 June 2006,"OK, recently i bought the DVD of Brokeback mountain because i was curious about this whole dumb ""gay cowboy thing"" (of course i am a bi+ ) so i wanted to see this film because i would be able to relate to a romantic film about two people of the same gender.being honest i was expecting it to be one of them stereotypical gay movies where both actors are camp, clean and lip gloss freaks (not dissing because i am all of these - as you can see on my my space) anyway, it was lovely to see this film prove me wrong about gay people and gay relationships. I have been in many relationships with the same gender (god i sound like a whore, but i ain't really) but it is nice to see a same-sex relationship in another body (meaning i am watching other peoples relationship through some one else) because where i live, in Perth, there is a really small gay community, i am friends with 2 gay male couples and 1 lesbian couple and i barely see them that much so i don't really see a gay relationship take place that much in front of me so it is hard to see what the big fuss is about.I am not making sense and i think i may have gone of topic, so lets go back to the point. Brokeback mountain effected me more than any other film i have watched, for example, titanic had a very sad ending, i cried... but after 2 hours of the film i have gotten over it and went onto something else. Brokeback mountain has really effected me and got me thinking about the whole movie through and through for a few days now and the death of jack was too sudden, unlike the titanic jack.The film confused me also in some scenes with the Ennis meeting the parents etc so i do not have great understanding of the whole film yet. No need to answer my questions because there ain't any questions to be answered due to the fact that i have already made a thread about my questions.I wish everyone saw this movie, in fact homophobic or open minded i would like to show the world this film, to let other people understand that gay couples are just the same as everyone else and we aren't the stereotypical people others seam to make us out as.A while back I wanted to go see this film at the cinema but my friends (who are open minded and are girls) thought that i would get... how shall i put it... ""Hot"" because I myself am a bisexual/gay (i'm bisexual but lean more for guys than girls) guy. What made me felt like a disgusting person, i also felt as if gay people would get more sprung to a gay movie than a straight person go to see a straight movie... For the record i watched this as if it was a straight movie because i didn't think of the guys as a gay couple, instead i thought as them as a real couple.I am sorry i wrote a lot and it is most likely not making sense at all but to sum it all up, This film is effective, loving, emotional and should be broadcast on the main TV channels 4 or 5 times so everyone watches and never misses it.10/10",Brokeback Mountain
1141,cs188-bg,my brokeback experience,7,19 March 2006,"after months of hype about this movie, i finally saw it.my first impression? the movie was OK. not the ""epic"" love story, it's been made out to be. very quiet, honest movie. there were a bunch of boring scenes, and before you knew it it was over. i guess the lack of emotions and the quiet tone of the film had to be there in order to bring out the realism of the characters and place and time, but i was just like ""is that it?"". just didn't engage me very much. the quiet, accented, mumbled dialogue was frustrating. i couldn't make out half of what they were saying. Especially the last line, i had no idea what ennis said. i had to come on IMDb to find out.speaking of IMDb, that's when i first noticed that this movie has touched a lot of people greatly. was i missing something, i thought? i went over the threads to find out what happened during those ""I can't hear what they're saying scenes"" and found out that there might be some more meaning to this film than i thought. i then read the short story online. pretty good. i noticed that the movie was very faithful to the source material. almost all the dialogue remains the same from word to film. i like the author's writing style. very plain with spare details, but powerful nonetheless. after reading her short story, it really touched me.i went back to the movie again. the words from the short story and the praise from reviews and filmgoers alike kind of made this movie better for me. i still don't think it's that great, but i must agree with everyone that it's very poignant and afterwards, when you think back on it, it brings back thoughts and emotions of loneliness, regret, and quiet despair, which we have all gone through.with all that's said and done, this movie is undoubtedly VERY original and not in a weird, stupid independent movie kind of way. i don't think i've ever seen a movie where the gay characters are taken so seriously and where the focus is on the actual love between the characters. acting-wise, everyone is good. i really like anne hathaway (guess that differs from most other viewers). she had too few scenes. every time she's on screen though, she brings a much needed energy and spunk to the film. even in that phone scene. a nice balance between vulnerabilty, coldness, and compassion.so in conclusion, watch this movie. it's thought-provoking and haunting.

Everyone involved deserves kudos for bringing this brilliant film to the screen.The Academy Awards showed Hollywood's ugly side when it did not name ""Brokeback Mountain"" best picture.Most of the praise for this movie has gone to Heath Ledger and his brilliant performance. However equal praise needs to go to Jake Gyllenhaal for his amazing work in this movie. Many people have only given Jake's performance a brief mention. Well, I say pay equal attention to Jake. His Jack is the heart of this love story. He is especially amazing in their final scenes. He captures the words of Annie Proulx in their most tender scenes. While some may think it is easier to play the less intense character, I say that is not true. Jack's love, hurt, pain and bitterness come through in equal measure. He says so much with his eyes it is heartbreaking. Also, the Jack character should get attention because he is brave and is willing to live his life with the person he loves. He is not afraid of his feelings and that is so important. And while some think his aging job was not good, it is exactly accurate to the time period. And praise needs to go to Anne Hathaway. While her role is not as big, it is very important and her last scene is fantastic. Along with the wonderful Michelle Williams and her heartbreaking Alma.Overall a brilliant film that deserves all the accolades and awards it has received.

1144,lrlee,tragically disappointing,8,5 February 2006,"##### My post has MAJOR spoilers ##### Brokeback Mountain has and still is receiving a VERY limited release in the rural area where I live, so I made the 2 hour trek to see what I hoped to be a landmark film. I was gravely mistaken.I expected an ""epic love story."" Didn't I see that in reviews and even in the promos? While I am sure the story it tells is accurate in the way that homosexuals have been treated and are still being treated, I felt this movie did NOT portray an epic love story, it only promoted adultery and gay hate crimes. Not only did these men who truly loved each other, and yes, I really believed they did love each other, they cheated on their wives and Jack even had dalliances in Mexico and it was suggested with the friend he made later in the movie. Where was the honor? My rating is based purely on casting, directing and filming-not the story. The cast was outstanding. Anne Hathaway tossed the tiara to become the ""yep, he's dead"" widow, Jake and Heath were so awesome together, I think great things are in store for the both of them and Michelle Williams really blew me away. The scenery was amazing and I really felt everything was captured perfectly. I just wish the original story had been a little better.",Brokeback Mountain
1145,jovymemo,Another power of love,10,1 March 2006,"I had a chance to see Brokeback Mountain last night. The result was I have fallen for the movie. I think that the movie simply tells another love story but this time it chooses to focus on love that happens between 2 men under a circumstance of tough lives and massively limited acceptance from the society. Nevertheless, the story is not somehow considered a forbidden love.There are so many scenes in the movie that were so captivating and made me cry considering by magnificent and talented performances of the main characters showing animal desire and reluctant feelings of hesitantly knowing yourself and their what-is-the-right-thing-to-do justifications. While supporting roles like their wives who are unintentionally victimized by the can't-help-it bond of manhood also help oppress this contradictory love amongst the concerned parties. Even though many have found the portrayal develops in a slow move but as the movie goes by, most feel that it constantly reveals stronger and clearer symbol that ultimately takes you to the climax of the movie.The element of the movie powerfully repeats the fact that ""your heart is an uncontrollable organ of your body"" and ""love can happen between any different race, any different religion and of course between the same sex"".Brokeback Mountain is not really talking about sex between 2 guys but it is about love between 2 human beings. This equates to ""love is a force of nature"".If you give it a shot by not discriminating against gay people or not over-imagining that this is a guy on guy porno, this movie is another heartbreaking, tragically devastating love story that will make you feel very emotional. In my opinion, the final scene where Ennis says "" Jack, I swear."" is the most painful moment of the movie.I personally rate the movie for an A. If asked why ? it' s because of 2 things; 1. As a gay man, this love story hurts so bad. 2. As a moviegoer, this flick hurts so good!",Brokeback Mountain
1146,bhgardner,Quietly Amazing,10,30 December 2005,"I first became aware of Ang Lee as a director of incredible sensitivity after seeing Sense and Sensibility; later I rented The Ice Storm and wondered at how this man from Taiwan seemed to get into the heads and hearts of a bunch of white people in Connecticut. But this film more than confirms his genius-I've lived in rural Texas and I'd have to say the film gets the people of the West exactly right (although I don't know Wyoming; maybe the scenery-Canada standing in for Wyoming-might look a bit off to someone from there). Lee is now one of my favorite directors and this is my favorite film of 2005. I can see that some people might not like this film because the subject matter makes them feel uncomfortable, and it is long, gracefully paced and low on plot, but there is not a wasted word or a false moment in the movie. Lee's trademark is that he gives as much respect to the most minor characters as to the leads. My favorite line belongs to a minor subplot, though I can't give enough context to explain its poignancy: when Ennis says, to a girl he's been avoiding, ""I'm probably not much fun anyway,"" and she answers, ""Girls don't fall in love with fun.""I had thought the film would be more romantic if two handsomer men played the lead roles, but the very ordinariness of their appearance-especially Ledger, who is a rather plain looking guy if you ask me-heightens the feeling.I find it interesting that the background of their lives, esp. Ennis's, is extreme poverty. Who would have thought Hollywood would put forward an image of men in love that is poor, rural and white-the only people in America that it is politically correct to ridicule, but they're being shown as having a depth of feeling men are rarely allowed in movies. Lee's The Ice Storm is the first film about the 70's that doesn't make fun of the clothes. Brokeback Mountain is probably the first film about two men in love that doesn't make fun of them on some level. This is far more threatening to convention than anything self-styled radicals like Bruce LaBruce have ever done. The sad thing is that it took a bunch of straight people to do it. Gay men seem to make movies that show themselves as harmless, weak and a little ridiculous, just as black male comedians can't seem to resist making young black men into stereotypes. Heath Ledger's performance is heartbreaking. If he doesn't get the Best Actor Oscar there is no God. Anyway, I love this film and can't recommend it enough.",Brokeback Mountain
1147,premjogacenter,Times have changed - thank God - but not enough.,10,21 September 2012,"If every person who had reviewed this movie here on IMDb had watched it with an open mind - free of fear, homophobia, and prejudice - then the rating would be a lot higher.It's a perfect tragedy / love story. Anyone who says otherwise (and you only have to read some of the negative reviews to understand what I'm talking about) just got bent out of shape by the fact that it was a love story about - gasp! - two men!Well guess what. The US has a black president, and soon enough gay people will have equal rights alongside 'straight' people. Thank God.If you do have a heart - free from the blockages I mentioned above - you'll watch this film and be equally heartbroken and overjoyed. Overjoyed at the honesty and truth and LOVE portrayed in the central relationship, and heartbroken to recognise that the complexity they faced both within themselves and without is so very real.

1148,J0EISGREAT,profound,9,16 March 2007,"There is a scene about 3/4 of the way through this movie where the two main characters are passing a joint back and forth while camping on Brokeback Mountain. But you would have to pay attention to notice it. They partake in this behavior only once during the film, and no attention is drawn to it as it is never spoken of. To me, this is what makes the film so moving. The movie itself is about a homosexual relationship between two males living in the Midwest during the 1960s, but never does it force the issue on you. It is a love story where the characters just happen to be homosexual. In doing so, they make a statement far more profound than a movie like 'Crash' does, which is so obvious about its message. You feel for the characters not as homosexuals, but as people. This isn't a story of homosexuality, but of love. To me, this makes the audience understand the issue instead of just seeing it.",Brokeback Mountain

Both of their acting was superb, however, I was disappointed with Jake's acting. It did not stop me from loving the scenes between Jake and Heath. Their chemistry was great.Also, the cinematography was amazing, one of the best I have ever seen in a movie. Some of the shots were breathtaking.Besides this, the rest of the movie seem to drag on and just fall flat. I felt like that over half of the movie could have been cut and it would not have harmed the integrity of the movie. Most of Jack's story was pointless and did not add to the movie at all.All in all the movie was good, but nowhere deserving the Oscar nod for best film. I was highly disappointed because of the hype surrounding this movie.",Brokeback Mountain
1150,poorlittleteacher,A moving picture in every sense of the term,10,19 January 2006,"Brokeback Mountain is literally a moving picture...not of the motion and camera sense, but of the emotional sense. I came away from this movie with so much sympathy for a character (Ennis Del Mar) who would likely not want to evoke much sympathy for himself whatsoever from anyone. How wonderful that Heath Ledger can convey that feeling to the audience through his laconic speech patterns and body language. Heath as Ennis simply stole the show, and as a result we finally have another movie where the protagonist is real and so palpable that you ache for him in the moments where he stops to grieve for the bad hand life has dealt him.Jake Gyllenhall as Jack was a very nice surprise to me. Tragic and beautiful is the best way to describe Jake's Jack Twist, who is versatile enough in his character to either frustrate you with his reckless behavior or break your heart with his incredibly emotive and sad eyes. Jack wants so little but seems to be asking an awful lot, friend...The supporting cast was also excellent and did their best in presenting their characters memorably while not detracting from the simple love story that's struggling to survive. The entire production itself was grand, and it's amazing such powerful work was done in this day and age with so little money. How fitting for a movie that knocks you over with an eagle's feather.",Brokeback Mountain
1151,misterben,"Emotional, powerhouse film",10,10 January 2006,"Brokeback Mountain is a story about love. Familiar love. Unexpressed love. Physical love. Ang Lee's sweeping drama raises startling questions about love's power over two people and what they are willing to do to preserve that love when it is at odds with their environment and their subculture.As others have said, this movie mostly takes place in the harsh but beautiful Wyoming frontier. Drifters Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) are hired to herd a massive flock of sheep in the summer of 1963. The two spend their days on horseback transporting the sheep down Brokeback, and their nights discussing their lives over a campfire and whiskey. Their relationship crosses over to the physical when they share a tent one cold night and Jack initiates intimacy (By the way, the sex scene is NOT intended to be erotic; it is very violent, much like what you would expect two testosterone-fueled cowboys to have).When the summer ends, Ennis gets married to Alma (Michelle Williams), and Jack moves to Texas and becomes a rodeo champion before marrying Lureen (Anne Hathaway). But the two can never forget the summer where they shared love, and soon begin meeting together several times a year for recapture the ecstasy of that summer. As the years progress, Jack becomes more and more desirous to start a life with Ennis. However, Ennis, marred by a disturbing childhood experience and an inability to express himself emotionally, finds it difficult to give himself to Jack.Stellar performances abound in this movie. Gyllenhaal captures the vulnerable and expressive Jack flawlessly (and, in my opinion, redeems himself for The Day After Tomorrow). His earnest, gentle Jack is the emotional center of the film. Williams gives poignancy to her role as Ennis' long-suffering wife. And Hathaway, in a stunning departure from her Princess Diaries role, plays Lureen with an acute stoicism.However, Ledger's character of Ennis is the scene-stealer here. He faces the challenge in the movie; he must come to terms with his troubled past and learn to express himself emotionally to Jack, or risk losing him. Ledger gives Ennis facial expressions that communicate more than his limited dialogue.This is NOT a gay western. It's a drama set in the west where two men share different kinds of lovephysical, family and fraternal. The direction, writing and the performances make this a powerhouse film. Brokeback Mountain will stay with me for a long, long, time.",Brokeback Mountain
1152,Dcap4188,The Best of 2005,10,6 February 2007,"Ang Lee's devastatingly beautiful ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a magnificent achievement. Early in production, the film was dubbed ""the gay cowboy movie."" The term is a tragic simplification of what is actually an exquisite love story, gay or straight. ""Brokeback"" is quickly shedding its nickname and breaking down barriers as more and more people actually see it and succumb to its beauty and heartache.The film is small in budget, but epic in scale and vision. It begins in Wyoming in 1963. Nineteen-year-olds Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) have been assigned a flock of sheep to guard on Brokeback Mountain. Ennis is a taciturn ranch hand who in one conversation with Jack says more than he has in an entire year. Jack, a part-time bull rider, is the more extroverted of the two. They make an unlikely pair, but Lee handles the developing relationship with great tact so as to make sure it is believable.One night, after a long evening of drinking, Jack and Ennis surprise themselves by having sex. The scene is an awkward experience not only for the characters, but for the audience watching them as well. Had the sex been between a man and a woman, the scene might not have been given a second thought. The fact that it breaks from tradition, presenting a so-called ""forbidden love"" unabashedly up-close and intimate, is part of what makes the film such a cinematic landmark. ""This is a one shot thing we got going' here,"" says Ennis the next day. ""You know I ain't no queer."" ""Me neither,"" replies Jack. Quite the opposite is true, however. That fateful night on the mountainside sets into motion a tumultuous romance that will span two decades.After their summer on Brokeback, both men eventually marry and have children. Ennis finds a loving and devoted wife in Alma (Michelle Williams). Jack meets a real live-wire in Lureen (Anne Hathaway), whose father owns an expensive farm equipment business in Texas. One day a postcard arrives for Ennis postmarked Jack Twist. It is the first word he has heard from him in over four years. The two reunite in a tryst of wild passion, and are once again caught up in what they thought they had left behind on Brokeback Mountain.As the years pass, Ennis and Jack meet only for the occasional ""fishing trip."" During one of these trips, Jack suggests he and Ennis buy a ranch together somewhere in the country. Ennis dismisses the idea as a fantasy. ""Bottom line is, we're around each other and this thing grabs hold of us, at the wrong place, at the wrong time, and we're dead."" Ennis recounts a childhood memory of a man who was tortured and killed because he lived with another man. His father made sure he saw the body.The rest of the story I will not reveal because some events are better left to be experienced in the theater where their power can be fully absorbed and appreciated.""Brokeback Mountain"" would not work half as well as it does if it were not for the multitude of fine performances throughout. The women are uniformly excellent. Michelle Williams, a long way from her days on ""Dawson's Creek,"" gives a performance of somber perfection. One scene in particular in which she confronts Ennis about his fishing trips is almost enough to guarantee her a nomination come Oscar time. Anne Hathaway, best known from Disney's ""The Princess Diaries"" films, shines as well. The extremely talented but often overlooked Randy Quaid, Linda Cardellini, and Anna Farris each have brief but memorable roles that, despite their brevity, are integral parts of the story. Jake Gyllenhaal caps off a great year with his superbly nuanced performance as Jack, a doe-eyed optimist who grows tired of only being able to see Ennis two or three times a year. As Ennis, Heath Ledger delivers the performance of a lifetime. Ennis is a man of few words, but when he does speak, it is as if the words are literally punching to get out. Ledger proves that sometimes less is more as he uses his body to express things that words alone never could. Ledger is, in a word, brilliant.Screenwriters Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana deserve recognition for adapting the eleven-page short story by Annie Proulx into a two-and-a-quarter hour film. Dialogue in the film is sparse, but it only serves to make each word uttered that much more important. When Ennis says, ""If you can't fix it, you've got to stand it,"" our hearts break because we know there is nothing that should need to be fixed.In addition to being one of the most compellingly acted and written films of the year, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is the most stunningly photographed. The tagline, ""love is a force of nature,"" fits it perfectly. Ang Lee and cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto use every opportunity they have to connect the power and beauty of nature (lakes, streams, clouds, rain, snow, hail, thunder, etc.) to the most raw and complex of human emotions. Brokeback Mountain itself is a symbol of freedom for Jack and Ennis. It is the only place they can go to truly love, and be loved, with no restraints.""Brokeback Mountain"" is a film of limitless possibilities. Its true power lies within its ability to linger and haunt long after the final credits have rolled. It forces us, as any good film should, to ask questions, questions about the world and ourselves. As I sat and watched ""Brokeback"" I couldn't help but wonder what life might have been like for Ennis and Jack had they found each other today. Would their fates be any different? I would like to think so.",Brokeback Mountain
1153,checyn,The Haunted,10,19 December 2005,"Brokeback Mountain is one of the rarefied films that has the ability to truly haunt us. If I were to compile a list of my favorite films of all time there would be many that participated in advancing film to a virtuosic art-form such as Casablanca, or Gone With The Wind, etc. But there is a much shorter list that genuinely affect us in ways that we are recognizably changed for having seen them. That list for me is distinctly modern and weighs in with American Beauty, The Hours, and Brokeback Mountain. They all are children of amazing direction and acting that embody film as transcendent art, not solely because they have great DP's or dialog but because their social commentary resonate our souls. Sometimes we know things about humanity that we didn't even realize we knew until presented with them, and their fundamental nature is so rooted in us that they feel they are actually a part of us: ""I guess I could be pretty p!ssed off about what happened to me ... but it's hard to stay mad when there's so much beauty in the world. Sometimes I feel like I'm seeing it all at once, and it's too much. My heart fills up like a balloon that's about to burst ... And then I remember ... to relax, and not try to hold on to it. And then it flows through me like rain. And I can't feel anything but gratitude for every single moment of my stupid little life."" ""So, this is the beginning of happiness. This is where it starts. And, of course, there will always be more. It never occurred to me it wasn't the beginning. It Was happiness. It was the moment  right then."" These are the movies that center us, as does Brokeback Mountain. There is a ubiquity to the theme of forbidden love which many reviewers have extrapolated to varying conditions such as inter-racial love or even a career for which we are passionate but are limited access to, etc, but as a gay male I am finding it hard to separate myself from the film's specific condition of attempting to deny one's sexuality. I left the love of my life in the green hills of Virginia for the dust bowl of Arizona and the supposedly fulfilling future of a straight life with wife and kids. Our love was quite forbidden in the culture of the Shenandoah and in the deeply religious eyes of my family and so I bore the ember in my hand, out of sight, until it burned so badly that I had to let it out in the open. And now, two days after Brokeback, I still fight back tears thinking of holding my boyfriend, consoling him in between tear-soaked thanks for not burying our love in a place that would have consumed us both, on our Brokeback Mountain, the Shenandoah Valley. The images of Ennis and Jack as they are haunted by each other and by what they could have been in a different era or place center us in our resolve to live our love and love our lives in whatever incarnations God has presented us, and Godwilling, this is one haunting that shall never leave.",Brokeback Mountain
1154,ednakrabapley,"Not Only the Best of the Year, but the Best of All-Time",10,29 January 2006,"I recently had the immense pleasure of viewing Brokeback Mountain; I had very high expectations and I was completely blown away.This film is as close to perfection as movies can get. The acting, directing, and multi-layered, beautiful story are top-notch.Starting with the acting, the performances are all fantastic. Heath Ledger completely ditches his image as a teen heartthrob with this mature, complex role. His voice pattern is notably different, as he has achieved a consistent tone of voice for his character, Ennis Del Mar. Ledger deserves the Oscar, at least in my book. Emotionally, there is not a false note in his performance. Jake Gyllenhaal is equally incredible in his part; he plays his character, Jack Twist (or ""Jack Nasty""), so very, very well. One of the most beautiful aspects of the two leading males' performances is how beautiful and realistic they make their love for each other seem. If you pay attention to the way they look at each other, how they place their hands, or the ways they react to each other, you'll see how wonderful and romantic their love story is. The two leads, who give AMAZING and heartbreaking performances, have genuine chemistry. I also loved how the writers spend time allowing you to get to know Jack and Ennis and feel for their relationship, and before their first sexual encounter, their true friendship.As for the supporting performances, all are above-average -- to say the very least. Michelle Williams plays Alma Del Mar with stunning grace; she reaches emotional heights you wouldn't expect from a former Dawson's Creek star. She also provides one of the films many memorable lines -- ""Jack Nasty."" Anne Hathaway also does great things with her part. Her performance is very subtle and she's wonderful in her part as Lureen. The attention-to-detail that is paid to her character is remarkable and makes for another reason why I deeply adore this movie. Ang Lee, as director, easily deserves the Best Director Oscar this year. I commend Ang Lee and the writers for making this movie honest and real; they did not tone down any of the gay themes. They didn't try to sell it to a PG-13 audience (thank God). They've made this film with breaking grounds and if you cannot handle it, then this is not the movie for you. I am very pleased with the representation of the characters; they are beautifully-written, wholly-developed, and are presented authentically. Lee brings this incredibly heartbreaking story to vivid life in such a powerful way. Watching this movie, I felt like I knew the characters, like this was a true story and the events happen to people I know -- *that* is how incredible his work is. A joyous bonus is the gritty and breathtaking cinematography. The look of this film is almost as beautiful as the emotion at it's core -- and that says a hell of a lot for cinematographer Rodriego Prieto. Another excellent technical aspect, aside from the fine editing, is the musical score. The score, like Ang Lee's direction, excellently echoes the tone and feel of Annie Proulx's desolate and beautifully-written story. Gustavo Santaolalla composes a wonderful, haunting, and brilliant score that is used effectively and flawlessly in the film. His heartbreaking score, ""The Wings,"" is as fine as music gets. The spare stylings to the score fits very well with the film. This story has stayed with me for days. You've probably heard people say this movie is ""haunting"" by now, and they are absolutely correct. Never has a dramatic film so deeply touched me, or lingered in my head for this long of a time. This movie has repeatedly moved me tears -- AFTER I've seen the movie! Because this movie is such a powerful tearjerker, I've been depressed for days; remembering the stunning events in this movie is like remembering the spirit of a deceased loved one. Brokeback Mountain got me good. Somewhere, deep inside, the pain will always be there.Brokeback Mountain is a flawless, unforgettable film with many layers. The characters are unforgettable and life-like. The nuances and metaphors in this film are incredible and thought-provoking. And the story is devastating, honest, and bold, making this a film that will forever stay in my heart. This is, for sure, the greatest film I have ever seen.",Brokeback Mountain
1155,tri_mj90,All you need is love,10,16 April 2006,"I love this movie. It touched me deeply and it is still to be found in my heart. And it will always be. Some people say that it is about homosexuality, but they would change their mind as soon as they saw it. It is about love. Pure love. Love is one of the only things in the world, that all people share. One of the only things that everyone in the world, no matter who and what they are, can relate to. People experience love in different ways, but it is still love. And that is, for me, what this movie is about. The story about Ennis and Jack made me laugh and cry. It filled me with joy and with anger. The beautiful locations amazed me. The strong and wonderful story touched me. And the fantastic acting mixed those two things and turned it into a perfect movie.",Brokeback Mountain
1156,agneska,Dullest film ever,1,30 August 2007,"For me and a lot of other people I know this has been the dullest film ever. It was really hard to stay awake. Still don't understand what all the fuss is about. Basically two guys that fall in love... so what? what is the point of making a movie where nothing, absolutely nothing happens?Also don't get why all the Oscars, even less the amount of nominations it had. I am sure there are plenty of films about homosexual relationships that are worth watching and none ever talks about them. Is this such a ""great"" movie because of the artist staring? Again I say it was very difficult to stay awake, because the story is just non-existing. I am just glad I did not pay to go watch at the cinema!!!",Brokeback Mountain
1157,ckolsarici,Much less than what I had expected!,5,27 December 2005,"I totally went to see this movie expecting to witness another point of view to love. I absolutely have no prejudices against homosexuality, I think none of us should have. This movie supposed to tell a love story between two cowboys. One of them has been with men before (Jack) but the other one doesn't even know he is gay. The are alone on the mountain with the sheep and they become attracted to each other after some point. Fair enough! I believe this story could have been told much more successfully. It was soo long at the most unnecessary parts and it didn't give enough details at the more important parts. For instance we still don't know exactly what happened between Jack and his wife,how did she understand that he was gay, why did he decide to move out with another guy if he was so in love with Ennis, what was he thinking? The end of the story was so fast and confusing and i think the audience mostly has to fill in the gaps in the story or maybe she is expected to do so, maybe that was the intention of the movie. I have no idea! When it was over and when we were leaving the theater, I asked myself what was the intention of this movie? Is it trying to tell that love is something that can happen between any sort of people, you cannot control your feelings and you cannot control what you do when you feel love? Or there was high pressure on homosexuality back in 60's, 70's including social pressure, psychological pressure of the person he does to himself, so people were living the lives they didn't want when trying to conform the norms?Or maybe you effect the lives of the people that you lie (like wives and children) to a great extend and you don't really care about what you do to them because you are so madly in love (!) and that is okay??Is it really? As a bottom-line, I didn't get what exactly they are trying to tell, what exactly is their point of view? Or maybe they are just impartial and they are just telling the story and you can think whatever you like, take whatever side you wish! If that was it, then they should have told more, there should have been more dialogs between Jack and Ennis, between Ennis and his wife, or even monologues would have been okay like a character talking to himself revealing how s/he feels!Although acting was really good,It basically did not deliver me enough, and I think I could have been much much better with that kind of a story.",Brokeback Mountain
1158,toaster07,Impressive,9,13 September 2005,"Excellent!This is a film that may not make a lot of money in the US, because it scratches on a very delicate theme which is still a big taboo (much more so than any crime & violence; cf.CNN). It's a beautiful portrait of the social patterns around the two main characters and an excellent starting off point for any discussion on tolerance and sexuality. It's heartbreakingly sad to follow the story that leads to the destruction of two lives. Do we really have to make anybody feel miserable just because they prefer the equal sex?Having said the obvious I must add, that the film-making as such is state of the art: the pictures/cuts are beautiful and the plot tears you smoothly along through the film without hast and never letting you go.Go see & think.",Brokeback Mountain

This beautiful, tragic love story is a ""must see.""I cannot imagine anyone seeing this movie and walking away unmoved.

I definitely can't say that it is the best movie ever made, because it is not, but very daring and - oh my God, if we thought that ""Million Dollar Baby"" left us feeling uneasy, wait till you watch this one. On my way to see it I kept saying to myself - oh, I just hope it is good, please make it good. But I had a (reasonable) fear that it is going to be a mediocre movie. I thought it had to be. A serious (gay) director gets tired of ""straight"" big budget movies, he gets two hot straight (rising) Hollywood stars - and bam! we get a mediocre movie, but everybody gets happy. It doesn't stir up lot of things, they make some money (silly gay people will pay all the money in this world to see two hot studs making out), actors get back to their straight lives and careers - and everybody is happy. Oh, how wrong I was. Luckily, I must add. The slow pace - perfectly fits this movie. It lets you admire the beauty of both the mountain and the actors, and it kind of lets you think and re-think, over and over. Their destinies and lives, and of course your life, mistakes and future. Mountain-little town-cowboy-small-minded people setting - perfect again. It makes you twitch just thinking what must be going through their minds (both the lovers and others). And also, if you thought that love, pain and suffering come to people who are noble, well-bred and sophisticated you better be ready for a surprise. It is worth watching and watching again (I think). The theatre was pretty full, but unfortunately, I think they were mostly gay and artsy people. But, again, who cares - the message is there, it is left for us to decipher.",Brokeback Mountain

I came out of shaking my head in disbelief, not at the sheer audacity and boldness that the writer and director had, but at how overly hyped this movie had been. I give this movie a 6 only out of kindness and because of the groundbreaking nature of the film. I was bored immediately and truly not enthralled by it. The writer did not create a film that drew you in, even as a romance. I'm a guy and stereotypically we don't like romances, but I don't mind them, if it's well written than you can get into the relationship. This movie seemed hastily written, and instead of spending a lot of time on the script and dialogue, the writer simply wrote a movie to become noticed. Had this movie been released 5 or 6 months later, and that 5 or 6 months had gone into more revisions of the script, this movie could be one of the better movies of the last 20 years, maybe even all time.",Brokeback Mountain

Incredible performances from all four leads, stunning cinematography, wonderfully evocative score... I really didn't expect it to be as amazing as it was. It's in my top ten films of all time.One of the best things about this film is its subtlety. On rewatching so many little bits connect up, lines heartbreakingly echo previous lines, the camera lingers on a window or a toy horse to draw our minds back to an earlier scene. It is rich in symbolism.To those who think this is a gay love story? Do not underestimate it. It is far bigger than that. It's a story of regret, of the prisons our own psyches put us in and a fascinating study of love stunted in its growth, trapped in a decaying idyll.",Brokeback Mountain
1164,JimG2727,achingly beautiful,9,22 December 2005,"All the pieces fit together nicely with this one. What impressed me most is that all the actors seem so at home with their character that it's easy to lose yourself in the film. There is no one glaringly out of place. Same with the camera work and score, it's great without drawing attention to itself. Gyllenhaal especially has a tough job, to emote while his character is supposed to be trying harder than anything NOT to emote. He pulls it off admirably.Really appreciated the use of setting, too. The happy and playful scenes are outdoors in nature, and the tense and angry scenes are indoors with much harsher lighting.My one complaint would be the pacing. It moves slowly -- and I think rightly so -- through the first couple of reels, but then doesn't pick up later in the film. I found it dragged a little post-mountain. Although, that could be because there's so much angst and tension that you can't wait for it to be over.That said, it's a beautiful film that will make your heart ache, and make you want to fall in love worse than anything.",Brokeback Mountain

But the raw emotions in this movie really grab my heart. Heath Ledger was amazing as Enis - I wanted to grab him and shake him and yell at him: see what a wonderful guy life has given you! Don't let him go, whatever the price is. Jake Gyllenaal was very good too as Jack, brave, willing to give up everything if Enis had let him.

1167,jimmy-crain,"'Jack, I swear'",10,28 June 2014,"One may think of John Wayne or Gary Cooper when it comes to cowboy figures in cinematic history, yet none quite like what we see in Brokeback Mountain. Directed by Ang Lee, the movie subverts what is usually associated with this type of character especially in the western genre. Brokeback Mountain is still a journey of the characters, but a different kind. Adapted from the short story by Annie Proulx, Brokeback Mountain tells a story of Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) who get hired to herd the sheep at Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming during the summer of 1963. Their personalities are polar opposites: Ennis rather keeps to himself whereas Jack is talkative. It was the latter who breaks the barrier between them. They slowly forms an unlikely bond that develops into something else that their society is not ready for. From then on, the dramatic tension of the story becomes stronger. The tone gloomier. After their departure, Ennis and Jack won't meet again until four years later, which by that time, both have already tied the knot to Alma (Michelle Williams) and Lureen (Anne Hathaway) respectively. Brokeback Mountain becomes significant as it remains the only place for their tryst, and the only place that remains untouched by their 'reality'.Ang Lee approached the subject matter and the characters with sensitivity and subtlety. The movie spent sufficient time in setting up the tension of their emotional bond just enough for us to care about them. Lee does not rush in exploring the very well-constructed leading characters. It still haunts me how the scene of the dead sheep in which Ennis encounters after a night of his absence almost symbolically signals the tragedy that may arrive as a consequence of their secretive relationship (the scene is right after the night of their first sexual intercourse when they could not keep their feeling inside anymore). As the film unfolds later, we learn that the sheep may very well remind Ennis of what haunted him as a child. I appreciated that Lee conveyed this love story in a raw and real manner. The score by Gustavo Santaolalla complemented to the film beautifully. The cinematographer was also stunning. In what seems like a banal and dull place, so much depth and dimension were added to the images. There are many shots with well-composed deep focus. The performances from the two leads were also top-notch. Heath Ledger gave a heartbreaking performance as Ennis. His portrayal of a man who represses his inner feelings was subtle. The last scene with 'Jack, I swear' line was deeply moving and summed up why I love Ledger's performance. Jake Gyllenhaal also delivers a tremendous performance as Jack, hitting the right note especially when he displayed vulnerability. Michelle Williams was good as well.It is a shame that the movie did not go home with the biggest prize from the Academy Awards (one of the biggest mistake the Academy has made). Nevertheless, the movie will age well for years to come and go down in history as one of the finest films ever made.",Brokeback Mountain
1168,cmcconne-1,"A fine film, but a classic-to-be? Perhaps not.",8,5 February 2006,"Just before I saw the film today (02/06/06), a friend wrote to say:""It's the funniest darn phenomenon. In Great Falls the letters to the editor have not been along the lines of 'take that dirty movie off the screen' but rather, 'How dare the critics think we are so provincial that we can't handle such a movie!' ""I'll share my reply, and add a further comment about the representation of ""place.""""We got to ""Brokeback Mountain"" downtown this afternoon with our friends--half the price of the suburban multiplex. We all liked it, and there are some fine things in it. But my strongest reaction, even near the beginning, was, ""This is a movie more to be admired than loved."" It was two hours+ long--a risky thing, despite the pace being justified by the content, the screenplay, and the cinematography. It know it had to be slow-paced, but it seemed to struggle to get underway. Finally, though, it did get underway. The turning point for me was when Ennis's wife discovers what his friendship with Jack is about--there is finally a context, a community to be reckoned with (for the audience not least of all).Another early reaction was to admire Heath Ledger's capacity to evoke Ennis's character, but somehow Gyllenhaal's performance crept up on me and in the end seemed the better achievement; but both were excellent.A good film and some kind of landmark, but not a classic-to-be--that's what I think right now. But maybe I'm comparing it to the pathos of something like ""Paris, Texas,"" which I saw twenty years ago and might not find as good now as I did then.""....And my observations about PLACE:I recognized so many of the Alberta landscapes, and I know them to be so different from Wyoming landscapes, that I really think something important was overlooked about the photographic/cinematographic language of landscape, though I recognize that the heroic Canadian Rockies are a plausible metaphoric landscape for much of the story. One particular scene I thought to be poorly considered from the perspective of locale was one near the end where Ennis and Jack are parting. Any viewer could have noticed that they were in a parking lot that looked out over a not-quite-full reservoir (probably Upper Kananaskis ""Lake"")-- hardly the emotionally charged environs for a ""Brokeback Mountain."" Or am I supposed to read that ""demoted"" landscape as emblematic of something?One more quibble: early in the film we see a zillion sheep spread improbably across a twenty-five degree alpine slope. I'm no shepherd, but I know that to actually get sheep up to a place like that would require a battalion of expert Basques (to say nothing of the environmental permissions), so instead we are treated (briefly) to budget special effects. In short, I'd have been happier with more attention given to concrete details like these.",Brokeback Mountain
1169,claire-m-kelly,Poetry,10,29 January 2006,"I saw this film yesterday, and while I was expecting great things, given the cast and director I was not prepared for the impact it had on me. I have to start by saying that this is not a 'gay' story. This is a love story, pure, painful, beautiful, and masterfully executed by two very talented young actors. Add to that Ang Lee's extraordinary direction, some mind-blowing cinematography of incredible landscapes (set in Wyoming, the film was made in Canada) and the sparseness of the dialogue, and you have a 144-minute experience never to forget. Supporting roles by Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway, and Randy Quaid are very well-executed, and a brief but memorable role by Kate Mara is nice treat. And despite the overall seriousness of the film and its themes, there are some very funny moments. Enjoy!",Brokeback Mountain

A film that titillates.I woke at 4 AM after seeing this film and couldn't get it out of my mind. A friend who saw the film with me had the same experience, except she woke up at 5.As I pondered the film I kept thinking ""If only he had..."" or ""I just wish she had..."" or ""If only the daughter had said..."" etc. If any one of those things had happened it would have been a more emotionally satisfying film - but it would not have been real.As much as things change - they still stay the same.",Brokeback Mountain

This is what makes film making an artJake and Heath are amazing actors and don't hold back in there scenes together. You really believe that they are in love.Heath Legder deserves the Oscar for his performance alone in the last scenes of the films.Amazing a must see film for all film fans.And finally for those that have read the book, the 64 pages have been translated beautifully. The script is amazing, and flows with such ease.Credit also to Ang Lee, who breaks away from what we know of him, and directs a film that to me and many his best work ever!!",Brokeback Mountain
1172,holly-sunter,Simpley Magic,10,7 February 2006,"Brokeback Mountain moved me and made me think in a way a movie has never done before. Hopefully this film will allow many people to think differently towards gay relationships and see that they aren't any different to anyone else's...maybe this film will help towards less prejudice attitudes...and it deserves every award and bit of praise it gets. At the end of the film...turning around...there wasn't one person who wasn't crying or thinking about what they'd just seen. No one moved from their seat for a few minutes and there wasn't the usual chatter on the way out. This film will capture you and throw you into a world where being gay isn't OK and where 2 men cant be together...you care about the characters and you so desperately want Emmis and Jack to be allowed to be together, all the time knowing really they never will be. The passion between the 2 male characters burns off the screen, stronger than any heterosexual relationship seen in recent times. This is a testament to the actors, who are not gay, yet have thrown themselves into making the relationship and struggles real...from heath ledgers, emmis, struggling to come to terms with his emotions and life, to Jake Gyllenhaals, Jack, who accepts who he is but cant accept he cant be with Emmis. Everyone says this is Heath Ledgers film and yes he is without doubt fantastic...but Jake Gyllenhaal is also fantastic and that mustn't be forgotten. The supporting cast provide the brilliant support the movie needs to be carried along.Some people say this movie is too slow and its not the fastest moving film your every going to see but that's part of beauty, if the shot of heath ledger hugging jacks denim jacket towards the end of the film and his ending line of 'jack i swear' doesn't break your heart, then maybe you don't have one. A movie with a message A movie that will move you A movie that will haunt you Simply a masterpiece.",Brokeback Mountain
1173,fansuvspy,Contender for the worst movie ever.,1,5 November 2006,"Okay, I don't care that it dealt with the gay issue. I'm sure it was tough back then for guys that liked other guys and that truly must have sucked for people that can't just change who they are and what they think. And the story itself was decent, but not award winning. And the gay sex scenes were just as uncomfortable as the straight sex scenes in other movies so what ever (meaning I hate sex scenes period). But this movie blew squirrels out of its ass. Alright so, a long and uneventful beginning where the 2 meet. Okay, they are awkward together, alright I get it, building tension, I see. Wait a minute, alright so did he just rape him, oh k, no, he presented, seems to be mutual. Okay they got fired, ya, that sucks, wait, why don't they....okay punch the wall if you must. So life just rolls on, you both meet people alright straight sex scene even more uncomfortable, wait your married now...WITH CHILDREN? WHEN THE HELL DID THIS....OH SO NOW A MUSTACHE, WHAT SHE DIES HER HAIR? Oh k, the dad doesn't like him...ya make out with the dude a little more in front of your...ya I wish you knew how to quit him too. Okay, return to sender....Now Jacks dead? WTF just happened. That (minus the insane amount of laughter) was almost an exact replica of my reaction. The pacing was so weird in this movie and the Director won the Oscar. Now, the portion of the year they had together doing that job took like an hour and the following 20 years took the same amount of time, that is bad story-telling on its own without the fact that they don't explain too much that goes on. They leave the job, they meet women, without warning (or wedding bells) they get married and have children in the following scene. I felt bad for Jacks character, but sympathy cannot carry a movie. Lets face it, this movie was all about the controversy, and so is the Oscars. It seems every year a minority group is chosen to be a theme ingredient that will make it a contender for the good awards, otherwise it's over looked. Capote, Brokeback... it seems that year was homosexuals. No one told the Crash makers though, so they just made a movie based on all of the minorities, and it paid off. Okay, a GOOD movie about homosexuals does not bother me, however a HORRIBLE TRAIN WRECK that only focus on the fact that its about homosexuals bothers me. And yes, I agree that this review sucks and might even be one of the worst, but I contest, the worst review for the worst movie.",Brokeback Mountain

I come from a very Christian background, and they completely frowned upon the fact that I even wanted to go see this movie. But I thought it was really good. I was really surprised to see how many men were in the audience at the theater, but oh well its a part of life. I wish people would stop giving it this much attention, really like no one has every created a movie with gay people in it before. I mean really, the number of newspaper comments and the number of radio jokes is completely unacceptable!!! Why don't these people just leave them alone. Let them do whatever it is that they want to do. Besides who's not interested in seeing something like that at least once. Its just a movie!!!!! Peace up Atown Down RaShanda",Brokeback Mountain
1175,aws34,Wasn't that moving for me,7,12 January 2006,"My advice is to wait for this to come out on DVD.The film just didn't match the hype. The characters didn't move me all that much. Innis' daughter, Alma Jr. at 19, is the one I felt most for. She wants so much to be closer physically and emotionally with her father. The film never explains why Jenni, Innis' youngest daughter, never visits with her father.As far as Innis' ""strong, silent type"", give me good dialog any day instead of constant close-ups.This movie is a PRE ""coming out"" film. So what? Aren't there other more interesting subjects for movies?",Brokeback Mountain

Very upsetting when one of the main characters dies. BEAUTIFUL FILM, would recommend to anyone who loves a good romance, lots of sex scenes, sexy cowboys and old style setting. Terrific acting done by Heath & Jake. RIP HEATH, <3 Very long film, over 2 hours, However, worth watching. It has a lot of build up and it set over a lot of years. Not much coarse language which is good. The area which it is set (brokeback mountain) is a beautiful scenery and adds to the whole effect of the film. This movie is brilliant and I could watch it over and over!",Brokeback Mountain
1177,s1p1,Small moments are the best,9,24 April 2006,"There is a sequence smack in the middle of the movie where the two characters have matured, their lives are carrying on, and they meet on Brokeback Mountain for the umpteenth time. The smile, the recognition, the evident love and loyalty all become clear with one word from Jack, ""you're late"". . . along with an unintelligible apology from Ennis; perhaps this was the most poignant and bittersweet moment in the movie.The movie becomes more painful to watch -- earlier in the film -- with each viewing. This, I believe, is because the irony builds early on with the help of very subtle, but powerful character development. Some examples include: talking about the Pentecost and being completely ignorant -- their lack of knowledge of this is perhaps a harbinger of their doom? Some examples of innocence also build upon my emotions: the fascination with hail, kidding about rodeoing, making the tent look right.",Brokeback Mountain

So, without any expectations, I witnessed Jack Twist's and Ennis Del Mar's relationship grow from lust to love. The film follows the lives of the two men over a period of about 25 years. After witnessing the two hot guys marry separate women and have kids, I was reluctant to see them meet up again... ...and that they did. After four lonely years, Jack and Ennis meet again, and the reunion is likely to bring tears to your eyes! I won't give away anymore, because this movie MUST be experienced, not read about.

1179,s_jongkind,offended by nomination,7,17 February 2006,"being from Holland i completely have to agree with BjornEdstrom. Having just seen the movie I don't really get what all the Buzz was about. In the theater there were some iel!! and grose!! but the general public (most of them gay men or just women) went to see a love story which happened to be about two very repressed gay men. Brokeback Mountain is a rare movie, a mainstream movie about queers...oooeeeh..what a eye opener. I feel offended that the academy nominated the picture for best film. It's like positive discrimination all over again. I'm not saying that the movie was bad, because most of the acting in the film is pretty darn good. Maybe for middle America this movie will give the chance to change the general opinion about gays, but here in Europe the movie is a step back. gay men generally die or end up in trailer parks or end up having a very scary decease, this movie ain't different. First of all the gay men are repressed and don't come out of the closet and the only love-scene in the movie looks like a rape. Not liking the characters would be considered homophobic and I think this is part of the reason why the academy nominated the movie. this movie ain't a 8/10 but at the highest a 7/10 and people giving this movie a 10 ain't helping the gay community so stop being so darn PC..the movie confirms the repressed state the community is in..

1180,GNOSSIS24,Climb every mountain.....except for this one,8,14 January 2006,"""Brokeback Mountain"" has finally arrived in the Midwest and I couldn't have been more excited. After having seen it, I couldn't be more disappointed. I had read the short story upon which the film is based and I was curious as to how they were going to be able to expand it into a two and a half hour film. Now mind you, I was not really impressed with the short story, but I figured it was an interesting concept and thought maybe Larry McMurtry and Diane Ossana could flesh out the bare bones story. Unfortunately, they failed. I will be the first to admit that I love a quiet movie that tells it's story through action versus an unnecessary amount of dialogue, but I felt as if I needed more from Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar, more of their relationship, more conversation instead of them frolicking in the fields. I did not feel much of a connection between the two leads and I believe it may have been the actors who are responsible. Something that has always been a point of contention for me in most movies involving a romantic theme is the kissing. Most people in films kiss without passion, as if they are strangers who hardly know each other, a tight lipped smooch is supposed to show me the passion that people feel for each other. Jack and Ennis share quite a few tight lipped kisses and it destroys the feeling of passion they may have been trying to convey. I realize that they were not making an X rated film, but two characters who have been apart for so long who finally see each other would no doubtedly give each other what some of my friends call a ""soul kiss."" Instead, Jack and Ennis share what a character in ""The Wedding Singer"" calls ""church tongue"". Actors nowadays make plenty of money doing the films that they do and I expect that they would completely immerse themselves in a character, throw caution to the wind and kiss like real people do in a moment of pure passion. The acting, other than the kissing, was fine, but nothing I would call Oscar worthy. ""Crash"" is a much better film and I hope it gets the attention it deserves because ""Brokeback Mountain"" certainly does not deserve the accolades it is receiving. I hope the adult video world makes their own version, ""Bareback Mountain"", at least there would be some passion in the kiss.",Brokeback Mountain
1181,sarajasmine8,Haunting,10,20 April 2006,"Like all truly great art, the movie reveals itself in layers that are still unraveling long after the viewing has ended. I felt almost numb as the closing credits rolled, and didn't comprehend until the following day that my numbness was an indicator of how profoundly I was moved. There are sadly to few genuine love stories in the history of cinema; many are rife with mundanities and fluff. But Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhal project a passion that transcends lust. One can well imagine them together the rest of their lives if only they lived in a different time and place. Ang Lee is certifiably one of the top-tier directors of his time.",Brokeback Mountain
1182,MatthewCJones,"LIKED IT, but not for the intended purpose",8,19 December 2005,"I am a strong Christian and I go to a strong Christian University. Needless to say most people at my school would not go see this movie. But I am a filmmaker, and in order to be able to talk about this movie effectively I had to see it. So it did, and I was quite impressed. I liked the movie a lot. The cinematography was pretty amazing, the acting was some of the best acting I have ever seen. Jake and Heath both need to share that best actor golden globe and Oscar, Michelle Williams was great as well and I was VERY impressed with Anne Hathaway's role. Boy, she sure has changed from Disney. The story was very well told, I liked how they didn't say a lot, but still said a lot. For the ""Gay thing"" I think the purpose of the film was to show how two men were in love and needed to be together and in the end we were supposed to feel like they were meant to be together. I didn't get that. Frist of all, I don't think that they ever loved each other. I think that it was just lust. Think about it, they never once said I love you to each other and when they got together it was basically for the sex and they smoked, played around and argued. This lustful relationship ruined their families and their lives. Yeah, in the end Enis did keep a memory of Jack, but it was still lust. If they really LOVED each other Jack wouldn't have tried to fulfill himself with other men, his love for Enis would have been enough. And I think Enis would have moved to Texas, his kids weren't the problem anymore because his daughter wanted to move in with him. He could have found another job and Jack could have supported him some because he made a good amount of money in Texas. So in conclusion, for the awards coming up acting yes, picture and possibly screenplay, heck NO",Brokeback Mountain

It haunts me still and I think it will for a long time to come. It deserves every award it won and the ones it didn't win, too.

Scenes continue to revisit me and with each I live through the heart-wrenching anguish again. As Proulx said, it is hard to get these two men out of your mind. Ang Lee's pacing and direction has given the film the time to tell it's story in very believable terms. The isolation these men feel when apart is heightened by the lonesome vastness of the mountainous setting in which their love takes root. The photography is stunning. The supporting cast are also exceptional and so believable. It is to Proulx genius and Lee's direction that this romance of gut wrenching emotion avoids sliding into any sentimentality. It will go into history as a classic. I want to see it again!",Brokeback Mountain

1186,krazyhippie,gay cowboys=yum,9,10 December 2005,"LIKES -It's revolutionary, of course, and that's automatically a good thing. Yay for movies about queer folk! -I was really impressed with the actors; they're straight but they put their whole selves into those roles and it showed. They just let loose and went with the characters. -HOT HOT HOT scenes. Also some male nudity, yum. -Sweet romantic scenes in the beginning. I loved the whole first part of the movie, when they were working as ranch hands together. I liked that whole section better than any other part of the movie. It just showed an awakening, and new love. Challenging the person you think you are and going with what feels right. It was great. -Ennis' struggles were shown pretty well. He had a lot more difficulties accepting his love for and attraction to a man than Jack did. Jack recognized this struggle and was totally supportive, even after he got decked by Ennis in a fit of self-loathing rage. He fought with himself all the time, whereas Jack pretty much knew what he wanted and told Ennis, and was hurt when Ennis wasn't sure he wanted the same thing. -Michelle Williams is hot. A+. -Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal aren't so bad themselves, and put together--did I mention the HOT SCENES? -When Ennis and Jack first met, you could really get their sense of sort of noticing each other but trying not to. In very subtle ways, even, like when Ennis is undressing and washing behind Jack and Jack just has this look on his face--very subtle, not even trying to peek or anything, but it's obvious that he's overly aware that Ennis is naked behind him. The subtlety of moments like this were really well done. -The setting is AMAZING. Beautiful scenery, beautiful shots of it. The camera work was beautifully done. -The viewer saw two human beings in love, but fighting against personal struggles and circumstance. Not just two gay men. I think this makes it more accessible to the straight viewers with a narrower view of love. Sort of like Rent and how it affected my parents, two people who don't approve of gay love. But they were able to just see a relationship, and it really made it hit home that these are just two people in love, and why does it matter what sex they are.DISLIKES -The story was loosely strung together. There wasn't a solid plot line, so you were never sure where it was going really. -Ennis' violent streak wasn't at all attractive, and made it hard to relate to him and connect with him on an emotional level. He was a very quiet, withdrawn person, and he was difficult to read. Neither character was very fully developed by himself, but Jack was likable enough that you could still connect with him and feel what he's feeling. He was real. But it felt very one-way at times, until Ennis would finally collapse under the weight of his inner struggle and Jack would just envelop him. -Ennis' divorce came out of nowhere. He and Alma were distanced for years and years, then suddenly they got divorced. There wasn't really a single event that made you realize that the inevitable had finally come, so it seemed a bit odd when it did happen. -There were a few really graphic scenes that weren't necessary: a close-up shot of the gutted sheep and the visuals of two victims of hate crimes. They really took away from the rest of the movie because they were just gratuitous. -The first time Ennis and Jack had sex seemed sort of weird. They hadn't really done anything to make the other in any way suspect that they wanted each other, and in fact didn't seem to realize it themselves. So the randomness of the way the sex scene came about was sort of strange. It just didn't feel very authentic for some reason. And it seemed sort of violent too, but hey, that's Ennis. He was really rough with his wife, too. -The relationship between Ennis and his wife and kids was really hard to gauge. Well, I guess the relationship (or lack thereof) was pretty obvious, but you didn't know how HE felt about it. He was just so emotionally absent, and you never really understood it. His whole character was just difficult to read. -It wasn't as much of a romance as I'd thought. Of course it had its moments, but overall it was more emotionally distant than I'd expected. It was try to tell a love story, but without some key components of a love story.So...it was a really good movie overall, but I think many parts could have been done better and that disappointed me a bit. I really loved it, though.",Brokeback Mountain
1187,suzic,Heartbreaking Situation,10,21 December 2005,"This is a very sad story of two people who can't find a way to make their lives work together. The characters of Ennis and Jack are complex, raising this above the standard ""Romeo and Juliet they can't ever be together"" romance. Highly recommended, easily the best movie I've seen this year. Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams, and Anne Hathaway are all fantastic in their roles. I think this movie will appeal to many people, not just gays or women (because we women do love good sad love stories). This is not a ""message"" movie, but if there is something to be gained from it is a sense that if love comes our way we should take a chance on it and to be true to who we are. Go see it!",Brokeback Mountain
1188,tuxmoony,Watch this movie now.,10,29 December 2005,"What words can I write to describe this movie? Heartwrenching, beautiful, and haunting are best fitting in my mind.Ang Lee did an exquisite job directing this film. I think without him this movie wouldn't be as beautiful and well flowing as it is. His scenic shots are unforgettable. The screenplay writers are also amazing. I have read the short story twice before and I had no idea how the screenwriters would manage to take this dinky short story with very little dialogue into a 2 hour movie, but they did it flawlessly.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were spectacular as Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist. Now I know why Heath Ledger has been praised so much by critics. He plays a man of few words and faces, but somehow shows a huge range of emotions. And also Michelle Williams (Alma) deserves praise as she plays a woman who tries so hard to ignore the fact that her husband and father of her two girls is cheating on her with a man. Alma tries so hard to keep it together, but gives up in the end.The bottom line of my comment is that wherever you stand on homosexual relationships you still should watch this movie. It's, and I hate to be repetitive, universal. Anyone can connect to it. It's a beautiful movie and to not watch it because you are against homosexuality is a weak excuse.",Brokeback Mountain
1189,janua30,Contradictions and vindications,2,2 March 2006,"sometimes it becomes a hard task trying to find out what lies beneath the surface of a film dealing with gay issues. Me being gay myself I may have more of a hard time trying to uncover the hidden, real intentions, because I believe the only way to accomplish this is by putting aside one's own vindications. This might be quite an issue for gay activists and for those common straight people whose passive acceptance/no real understanding of other's gay identity goes far beyond critical rationality. Ang Lee tries to permeate the message of gay love between two lads with muscles and a beautiful mountain scenery (Canadian mountains! Ang, I guess you never heard of the existence of - some even handsome - Canadian cowboys?). That's way too easy. Basically, it really seems that the whole plot was based on:1) sexual unrestraint So it's not love, it's passion. It's two testosteronic machos who can't wait to meet each other and do fireworks with their hormones under the stars. It's a great picture, really, but at one condition: that you clearly acknowledge that it's a result of passion, of masculine, wonderful passion. Seeing it as love is a fraud.2) ""I didn't choose that"" attitude Who cares? It is likely that their respective wives wouldn't choose them, had they been told the truth right from the start. Fear and social ostracism aren't good enough as an excuse to ruin or sadden a woman's life. And this, regardless of a woman wanting a husband just to respond to a biological, ancestral call or for real love. And you see, this is even more true when one, as a gay, feels the very same need to answer his biological, ancestral needs... It is somewhat hard to conceive a married couple where both or one of the twos lie and/or hide things. Could it be that life can even be used in order to grow and become mature adults? And how can this be accomplished if fear prevents honesty from blooming out of our hearts? Whatever the result, even divorce, is better than living in secret (and she finally divorced, in fact). Ennis' wife wasn't maybe a very open minded woman but one thing is for sure: she would have loved her husband to be more nice to her and hug her even outside of the bed. There's a lot of wives willing to deal with their husband's homosexuality but they don't do it for free.3) my suffering is more important than all yours Yes, Ang Lee seemed so prone to quite exclusively focus on the love of these two guys and this is dishonest. The probably widespread view that it was all about love still has to be proved. They were not very talkative, not one scene showing even a weak attempt to get known each other deeply, to discuss about life issues. Everything was based on lust, on overwhelming urges, both of which are explained by the mound of desire accrued during so many months wait between a rendez-vous and another. That's the kind of suffering they were experiencing. Something originated by the lack of physical contact. Per se, it's something absolutely natural and it is normal to freak out if you can't express such strong and innate needs. However, no love can be considered as such when the need to express our own nature, for as strong as it can be, leads us to totally ignore who's around us and their feelings, especially when we never tried to open ourselves. This is what turns love into selfishness.How many in this world repeatedly say and said for centuries that love wins fear, shyness, rage, wars and, may I add, gives our brains a chance to find smart solutions to overcome the difficulties? Now I may not necessarily support this thesis, but it is quite surprising that the so called love joining these two cowboys was so strong, yet at the same time didn't give them not even a sparkle of intuition or push to find a way out. We'll never know, they didn't even try. As I was saying at the beginning, it's way too easy to touch the heart of gay people and offer them all possible vindications, when you talk about true love and make it appear as such by showing muscled bodies, gorgeous faces, sharp eyes, sensual lips and fires burning inside, so to prove how powerful and genuine a homosexual love can be. Thanks for teaching us the obvious, Ang. I too agree. Pity that this wasn't exactly a story about love, and my gay rights, be them to just enjoy pure sex with a man or love him, are worth being represented by someone who can still distinguish between love and passion.",Brokeback Mountain

So, when I went to see this film, I was a little bit skeptical, because normally, when critics love a movie, I normally don't. But this time, it wasn't the case. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal make a great duet of actors. Both their performances are extraordinary. We really believe their relationship and profound love for each other.Honestly, I don't have bad comment about this movie. I simply loved it. The story is great.

1191,aru89da,A surprisingly breathtaking film,10,9 February 2006,"I went to the cinema not really knowing what to expect; or to put it in other words, i had a wrong concept of the film: i thought i was going to watch ""that gay cowboy film"", totally overrated (as many movies that are nominees for the Oscars are). My thought just before the film started was: ""it will win the Oscar for sure, just because it's about gay people"". The first half an hour, just as the characters were slowly introduced and there were beautiful scenes of Brokeback mountain, i was anxious to watch their first encounter; i wanted to know whether it would be explicit, or how this unlikely relationship was going to be developed. But after this first sexual encounter finished, the plot started to develop and all I wanted to do was know more about each of the characters and how the story went on. However, I thought that it wasn't until the last line (said by Ennis Del MAr) is said that i could understand how lovely the movie was. And after i came out of the cinema, i couldn't stop thinking about the movie. All in all, i 'd like to say that all the characters were played brilliantly, but specially the main ones. I will never forget Ennis del mar. i really think that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is Oscar material",Brokeback Mountain
1192,paige-28,The Best Movie Ever,10,11 July 2006,"this film is far the best one I've ever watched for one simple reason. It is about a love, a deep and strong love, of two men who grew up in an environment where all men should be unaffectionate, tough, and not allowed to be sensitive,to express their love even to their wives, and if they do so they are severely criticized for it and become finger pointed. So, in such a hard reality two men have the guts to fall in love with each other and even though they can imagine the impact of their choice to their families they can not pretend to be happy in marriages which become the prisons of their soul and feelings. The circumstances lead them to hide their love because in that time and in that particular place the easiest thing to do was to point your finger and laugh at two men's love. Jack & Ennis were not quires. None of them. They were MEN. And that's what makes me congratulate them for the way they showed their love cause they didn't go around holding hands and kissing, they just wanted to share the rest of their lives together without anyone criticizing them.Except for the excellent script the direction of Ang lee is amazing too. Also, heath ledger and Jake gyllenhaal proved out to be very good actors by giving an astonishing performance full of strength and sensitivity. It seems to me that they were born for the characters. Michelle Williams is great too. Anne Hathaway is satisfying. Excellent the work of Rodrigo Prieto and Sandiago Santaolala.(sorry for mistakes in my writing-I'm Greek)",Brokeback Mountain

1194,Rontrigger,My all-time favorite film,10,8 August 2006,"Until this year, I had never seen a film in a theater more than once. By this summer, I had seen this film 33 times in different theaters and traveled a total of at least 1,700 miles to see it locally and in cities as far away as 180 miles. Even since it came out on DVD, ""Brokeback Mountain"" absolutely has not lost any of its power.It's quite simply a kind of story I'd never seen before--a story of a love between two non-stereotypical, non-urban men. I relate to their environment to some extent, having grown up in a rural area and now living 20 miles away in a city. It was refreshing to see gay men in a way of life that so many--including many gay men!--see as totally foreign to them and an impossible occurrence in real life.But it's not foreign and it's not impossible. Gay men really are everywhere--in Wyoming, in Texas, in the world of cowboys and rodeos, in the world of cattle and sheep ranching. If even one person has come to realize this, or changed his/her mind about how ""normal"" it is for someone to love someone of the same sex, because of ""Brokeback Mountain,"" then this film was very much worth making.",Brokeback Mountain
1195,tmp90210,An instant classic,10,5 November 2005,"Ang Lee has taken Annie Proulx's short story and brought it to life as one of the most emotionally wrenching movies I've ever seen. The cast is brilliant, most especially Heath Ledger, who is breathtaking as rancher Ennis del Mar. If he isn't nominated for an Oscar, the academy should disband. Almost equal to him is Jake Gyllenhaal as his lover, Jack Twist. The script is perfect, opening out the short story without losing any of it's emotional whallop, while the cinematography perfectly captures the otherworldly beauty of the area.Straight or gay, this one will stay with you long after the lights come back up.",Brokeback Mountain

More than the actual cowboys their selves, i preferred the performances of the wives that came upon a lie in their, otherwise, happy and common lives. Both of them, were believable, true and had essence to them... Also, Elma Junior was surprisingly moving. As for the ""fellas"", i'm not so sure of it!... I didn't see this as an actual love story, they were buddies that had sex! They didn't feel that truly connected to themselves on another level other than sex and being a cowboy. Their talks weren't that passionate and tuned... They ""loved"" as much as they fought, what they really liked was fooling around, hanging out on the mountain and, because there were no more people around, had sex with each other... Really disappointing, maybe because there was no really depth do the connection between Ennis and Jack.",Brokeback Mountain

The first half hour of the movie was just ridiculously boring, i found myself actually wanting them to do it haha. The film to me lacked emotion and character development. I will admit that the film was well made. The cinematography was great, plus the scenery.

1199,Starlight3o0,Wonderful! The best movie I've ever seen.,10,19 December 2005,"I first fell in love with this movie when I saw the trailer with a few on my friends while we were seeing 'RENT' and all of us agreed to see it when it came out. Since there wasn't a theater close to me playing it, I had to drive an hour to go see it. The whole time through the drive I was thinking, 'I can't believe I'm doing this to see a movie!' After seeing the movie that all changed.I have a several gay friends who love the movie and think it was a great way of showing people that it's okay to be gay. I have strait(guy) friends who enjoyed the movie as well.The acting in the movie is amazing! Heath completely transformed himself into Ennis and Jake was right on the money with Jack. I also like how they seem like real cowboys to me. They both could ride and Heath got his accent pretty well and they both seems very true to their characters. Plus, the fact that they took these roles really showed how dedicated they are to their work. Not many actors would have signed on for a movie where they would have to kiss another man. Michelle also was wonderful as Alma and she had just the right about of character on her face. She showed that she's really grown from ""Dawson's Creek"". Anne also did great as Lureen and really proved that she's not just the girl from 'The Princess Diaries'.The script was wonderfully written and was actually believable, which is something one doesn't see in movies too often. Usually scripts(especially in love stories) are fake and cheesy but this one wasn't, it was great and had just enough sting to it.The story was great. I was very open to it being a gay love story but I will admit that I was someone who called it 'the gay cowboy movie'. It wasn't until after I saw the movie that I realized it wasn't really about being gay at all, it was about being in love and how a love that's pure enough can really last a life time.In a nutshell, the movie was wonderful. I give it a 10/10.",Brokeback Mountain
1200,Pierre_Derriere,Grabs you by the throat,10,22 July 2015,"*** This review may contain spoilers *** Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal give equally moving and accomplished performances, although the story tends to focus more on the latter character. Heath is note perfect in this role. I didn't detect a fake moment once from him. Regardless of whether or not he wins an Oscar, his performance in this movie will be watched and admired for years to come as an ode to acting. I truly related to his character's internalized homophobia. Every gay man has been there before. In many ways, he represents the embodiment of shame and self-hate, a product of his American, western culture. The flashback showing his father take him as a boy to look at the dead body of some murdered gay man should be shown to every Christian fundamentalist out there who ever argued (and continue to argue) that homosexuality is a choice and that gay men and lesbians are nurtured by their environment. I've seen the movie four times now, and Heath brings tears to my eyes every time - he's so good.This is a film I am struggling to wean myself off. Its hard sitting through other movies now cause they all pale in comparison. Nothing has ever touched me like this. Its hard to imagine anything will ever again. I know you can't really give a film 11 out of 10 but there you have it. Brokeback Mountain is just that good.",Brokeback Mountain

I love a lot of movies and still respect that they are not as great outside of my head as they are inside of it. Reality v. perception, if you will.Well the reality and my perception of this film are, I'm almost entirely certain, on the exact same wavelength, which is: Ang Lee and the writers and this extraordinary cast have creating the most stirring, relevant, beautiful, romantic film that I can remember seeing. It is epic in its smallness; as much a watershed mainstream film as it is a watershed gay-niche film.This is a film that everyone should see. There is not a pair of eyes in this country -- straight, liberal, Pakistani, white, conservative, 15, 97, gay, bored, lonely, Korean, Australian, atheist, pious, and on and on -- who would not benefit from seeing it.Thank you to the filmmakers and the actors for this...

I am not suggesting that this movie is a masterpiece, but given today's ""rehash"" movie environment, I feel that this picture represents a new view on the same old boring love stories. It is a nice change of pace to see a movie that does not incorporate the same old silly traditional love story. Hollywood occasionally turns out a couple of nice ""big budget"" films each year and this is definitely one of them. The movie industry seems to want to redo the same old movies over and over (are we ready for another Rocky?) so it is nice to see this movie slip out to the masses. Soundtrack is great too.",Brokeback Mountain

It could have been three hours and you would not have known it.Heath really is outstanding, and Jake very good throughout. What I loved was that by the end you really did not think about this being a movie with gay sex (not that I would have minded but I am thinking about American views at large) and instead it was just a great (sad) story.I read some criticism about the fact that you were not sure just why Ennis decided to start having sex and then this relationship with Jack. However, it actually came across as much more natural and believable simply because they did not try to talk it to death or explain it away. The viewer just grows to accept it.I definitely want to see it again - there is so much going on that one needs to focus on it all more closely.Oh - and by the way - blink and the sex scenes are over. They are quite believable, quite hot, but they are fast! My only quibble with the film was the makeup used to age Jack and Ennis. At times it looked a little fakey and so I had to tell myself to ignore it.Great movie! Thanks to Ang, Heath, Jake, Annie, Diana, Larry and so many others!!",Brokeback Mountain

It is a very powerful film about forbidden love. Absolutely amazing!! When I went to watch it I was glued to it right from the start. No other actors could have played the parts as professional as Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Fantastic. And the girls or boys could also get a good view of them naked!! Best Film of 2005 by far!! I went to watch this film in the cinema and i was busting for the toilet because i had had a huge drink. But i could not leave the seat as i was so into the film.

1205,Athbee23,Love Forever,10,1 September 2018,"The only thing that this movie can ultimately
be called is ""The greatest love story of all time"". Two men who are in love, but they won't say the word is fantastic. Ennis the one who keeps his emotions bottles up falls in love with the talker Jack on Brokeback Mountain. Years later the men reunite and their passion is just as strong as it was years ago on the mountain. They meet up about 3-4 times a year in the mountains. Their love tortures both of them. How come they just can't end the relationship? Because they both have found true love in each other. Jack, frustrated with Ennis, sees other men, but ultimately he knows he's in love with Ennis and still miserable without him. Which makes him even more frustrated knowing that he can't ""quit"" Ennis. Ennis just can't speak what he's feeling to anyone. Though he is more open to Jack than anyone else, the fact that Jack is a man forbids Ennis to tell him how he really feels. Which tears Jack apart inside. Ennis didn't realize how he felt about Jack until his death. When he finds the shirts in the closet, that is when he realized just how much Jack loved him, and how much he loved Jack, but it was too late. What really gets to me about the movie is that Ennis could've had a life with Jack and he chose not to. And after Jack's death, he has to live with regret and guilt. The movie has made me redefine the word love and re-evaluate my life.",Brokeback Mountain

See over that, and there's nothing really interesting about it. Some of the lines uttered by the actors go from corny to simply laughable (""I wish I could quit you""). Some of parts of the romance defies logic. If you see it, you'll know what I'm talking about.It's not a terrible movie. It's not even a bad movie. It's just totally overrated. It doesn't deserve the awards it has, in a year of jewels like ""A History of Violence"" and even Peter Jackson's flawed, but touching and spectacular ""King Kong"".If you're looking for a compelling gay romance/drama go to the video store and rent Pedro Almodobar's magnificent ""La Mala Educación"".",Brokeback Mountain

It is about two cowboys Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger). They meet the year of 1963 when they both work as sheepherders for (Randy Quaid). It started out as a really good friendship until one night when they were both drunk they both slept in the same tent and had violent sex. Then they both tried to hide the fact that they loved each other like Heath's famous line in the movie ""You know I ain't queer"" and Jake saying ""Me neither."" Then they got married and had kids and met up 4 years later and started to have that same kind of relationship over again. Jack wasn't afraid to admit that he loved Ennis but Ennis was because he said that there were these two guys that lived together they were really tough old guys but one day one of them got a rope tied and dragged him around till his dick pulled off. I was only 9 and my dad made sure me and my brother saw it. For all I knew my dad could've done the job."" Those are his famous lines in the movie. Ever since then he never wanted to admit his love to Jack because he was afraid that would happen to one of them and he never wanted that to happen. Then after the last time they met up Jack died at the age of 29 but we'll never know the cause because Ennis imagines him getting beat up by people like what happened to the people in his old town or if he really died like his wife said.

1209,jakefear-60217,This movie changed my life,10,23 April 2017,"** SPOILERS **Let me just first point out that I only saw this movie about a month ago. Compared to all the other types of movies across all genres that I've seen, this in my opinion changed my life. It is the saddest movie I've ever seen (even sadder than Marley and Me and the Notebook). Every time I think of this movie which is 3/4 of the day for most days, it instantly puts me into a sad mood, and whenever I watch it, it makes me cry for more 20 minutes afterwards. I have never seen more heartbreak in a movie than any other movie ever.Secondly, half of the reason this movie gets me so emotional is the fact that for more than 20 years these two lovers have to keep their relationship a secret otherwise if anyone knew they both most likely be dead, because of the time this movie is set (between 1963 and the early to mid 80's), and after one of them dies, the other has to keep his sadness and heartbreak kept inside of him for the rest of his life, also the one that dies tries his hardest to try and create a life the two, he tries over and over again to convince the other to pack up and leave with him. The other half is obviously because one of them dies because of who they love. Throughout the years they had been together, you can see clearly the desperate and emotional bond between these two. It rips you apart when one of them dies. It will leave you crying and feeling sad.Lastly if you plan to watch this movie, I highly recommend a box a tissues cause you will cry, I guarantee you will.",Brokeback Mountain

The actors gave amazing performances, and the entire movie drew me in so deeply that I felt transported right into it.I had to work hard to hold back my tears at the end, and I didn't really succeed.I believe that for many this could be a life-changing movie, no joke. It's just such a deep love story, and makes you realize how gender boundaries shouldn't exist for love.I hope that everyone who sees this movie remembers it...and I don't doubt that they will.

1211,gabulldogs2021,Making Film History While Still Entertaining,8,4 February 2006,"I can't recall a movie as embraced by the public and shunned by the public at the same time as Brokeback Mountain. I entered the theater for this movie very low-key, only going to see it because I wished to see if it lived up to the hype which critics such as Ebert and Roeper had created. I was at first somewhat disappointed in the film, originally giving it an 8 instead of the anticipated 9, but as my time away from the movie increased, my appreciation for the greatness of the film increased as well. The love portrayed in the film is indeed universal, and creates unforgettable characters whose stories will be remembered the same way the storied of Ilsa and Rick has been remembered after ""Casablanca"". So many poignant scenes take place throughout this gem for 2005, most prevalently the scene in which Ennis visits the home of Jack's parents, and realizes the magnitude of his lover's death. This continues to add to the heartbreaking tragedy that is ""Brokeback Mountain"", and the final half-hour of the film could change the views of those who doubt homosexuality and believe it to be immoral and practiced only by those stereotyped by society today. This film eliminates this stereotype of homosexuals, and instead shows that people as physically and psychologically tough as cowboys can fall in love with each other the same way a man and a woman can. This film changed my views of homosexuality in the same fashion that ""Crash"", my favorite movie from this year, changed people's views of racists, and this comparison has been mentioned several times since I have seen the film.If I were a member of the Acadamy, I would not vote for this film as Best Picture, although the two supporting roles of Jake Gyllynhall and Michelle Williams are worthy of Oscars. Instead, my vote would go to ""Crash"". Still, ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a film destined to become a classic for it's impact on society and it's sheer universality. It has changed the views of conservatives such as myself, and will set a precedent for movies to come.",Brokeback Mountain
1212,A0885,Most heart-felt movie of our decade,10,31 December 2005,"At first I was apprehensive about seeing this movie. I thought, ""What straight man will go to see a movie about two gay cowboys?"" So, my sister got me the original short story which the movie is based on, and I read it within 45 minutes. The story was so amazing that I quickly went to see the movie. During the emotional points of this film, I admit that I sobbed. Although this film was labeled as a controversial film, it was, none the less, flawless and extraordinary!!! Afterward, I went to school and convinced 15 of my friends to watch this movie, and they all came back wanting to watch it for a second time. Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Michelle Williams delivered powerfully emotional performances. In this writer's own opinion, if Ledger, Williams, and Gyllenhaal do not win Oscars, then that will be the biggest disappointment/mistake of American Film History. I was so moved by this film that I went to see it a second time, and I sobbed again. Overall, it would be a mortal sin if one does not watch this film. This is a ""water-shed"" movie, and will probably/hopefully become one of the best films in history (along side Casablanca and Titanic). Go see this movie, I promise that (if you have an open mind about the understanding and acceptance of homosexuality in our society today) you will love this movie as much as I have. Thank you Ang Lee, Ledger, Gyllenhaal, Hathaway, Williams, and everyone else involved with this movie, it truly was a film that will become one of the top twenty films of all time, and one of the top ten most emotional films of all time!",Brokeback Mountain

This movie so beautiful in so many ways. It grabs a hold of you early on and won't let you go, leaving you starting at the screen, and leaves you thinking about it and the two main characters - Jack and Ennis - long after you've walked away, touching you so deeply that it feels more real to you than a simple movie, because it ceases to be that, and becomes so much more.In this movie, Heath Ledger portrays Ennis and Jake Gyllenhal plays Jack. They cease be Heath and Jake, and become Jack and Ennis. Ang Lee takes you through a journey of nearly twenty years that will leave you stunned and moved beyond words. Never before I have ever seen something that has touched me so deeply like Brokeback Mountain does. Heath and Jake are fantastic, and the ending will leave you teared up, wanting more, sad yet understanding about the sadness and tragedy of it.To name this the ""gay cowboy movie"" like it has been in the past is grossly underestimating the beauty and power of this movie. I advise everyone with an even slightly open mind to go see this, because really it's about being gay, it's about forbidden love of a romance in which you love someone like no other, but can never be with them - understandable when it takes place in the 1960's and 70's. It's about the power, beauty, sadness and tragedy of love, which after seeing this, you can truly say is the most powerful and mysterious force on Earth.Superbly acted, directed, and written, even the score of the movie helps tell the story and the emotions involved - simple, yet powerful, moving and haunting all at the same time. This movie touches you on a deep level, leaving a permanent mark. It is beautiful and moving beyond words as you wrapped into the sadness and tragedy of Jack and Ennis' lives on a personal level that, at least I, had never felt before for fictional characters, because it's so real on screen that it feels real to you, and I honestly think, and so will most that understand what I'm saying, that Brokeback Mountain is one of the greatest love stories of all time.",Brokeback Mountain
1214,sonsia,The cowboys who went up a mountain...,5,5 January 2006,"...and came down a hill.I found this movie disappointing. It certainly didn't live up to the hype. I do applaud the two leads being willing to take on such controversial roles, and then playing their romance out so realistically. But aside from that, I didn't find the acting great and the writing was uninspiring. This movie's saving grace, in my opinion, was the breathtaking scenery (which I have to credit Mother Nature for, ultimately) and the musical score.There was no emotional connection for me, with this movie. I didn't get a sense of why Ennis and Jack fell in love and stayed in love, and, as another review pointed out, Ennis is more pathetic than heroic. I get that that may have been the point, but when a movie tries to come off as a tragedy, you need to have the main character be somewhat sympathetic. As it was, I just left the theater feeling that Ennis deserved to be where he ended up in his life.I'm torn about this, because I would like to see more movies with gay leading men and women, so I want the movie to do well in full release at the box office. This one, however, isn't really worth the ticket price. See it at a matinée, or better yet, wait for it on DVD. I was left feeling just... 'Eh.' All I can figure is that it's getting this kind of enormous critical acclaim for the sake of political correctness.As an aside?

Many a movie have been good to give the feeling such as this, but this has been the only time I've really did show my sensitive side.

1217,grizzlygrrl,Moving and brilliant,10,9 January 2006,"I hardly know where to begin as I just got home from watching this film. The movie was beautiful, with awe-inspiring shots of the landscape framing the whole story. The strict attention to the development of the characters--especially the two protagonists, Ennis and Jack--anchored the film and gave it emotional depth. Heath Ledger was as good as they are saying, and quite frankly, although critics have been a bit rough on him, Jake Gyllenhaal was fantastic as well. I think the reason he gets a harsher treatment is because his character is less immediately sympathetic than Ledger's Ennis. Your Average Joe or Jane might be uncomfortable with Jack's patronage of Mexican prostitutes or his possible affair with a man other than Ennis; but it is his ebullience and willingness to risk all that I loved about him, in many ways he was a far braver person than Ennis. And when Ennis discovers their two shirts hung together in Jack's childhood room the deep love that Jack felt for Ennis is subtly and poignantly conveyed. The movie is as tragic for the ""might have beens"" as it is for the ultimate loss suffered by Ennis...perhaps the moment that hurts the most is when Ennis hears of Jack's death on the phone and you sense all the sudden pain that he cannot express. The ""flashback"" he sees during this moment is an enigma. Was Jack murdered the way that Ennis projects or was it an accident the way Lureen describes? Either way it underscores Ennis' lifelong fear and repression of his feelings. Similarly his rare moments of breakdown--both in the alley near the beginning of the movie and later in Jack's arms--are taut moments of truth and break your heart. This movie was absolutely beautiful, well directed, well acted and ultimately an example of the kind of artistic truth that film is capable of when all the pieces come together. It is a very human story that avoids melodrama with its aching simplicity and strong character-driven focus.",Brokeback Mountain
1218,archie-44,A Father's Love: A Movie Beyond Male Bonding,10,2 January 2006,"This is a wonderful and powerfully touching movie. As a dad with two boys, I think there is one message that is lost to most of the reviewers.

This is a story about unfulfilled expectations on the part of all the central characters, but the deeper meaning in this story is Ennis's inability to grasp a hold on his life because of an absent father. Ennis' feelings are as orphaned to him as he has felt throughout his life, and it is not ironic that of the two, he is the one who is obviously in control. The irony is, he doesn't know what to with it. The 'it' being the love he has for Jack.This movie will be discussed on campuses, restaurants and perhaps even Congress, possibly even pulpits. Arguments will ensue on what made each of them the way they are, but the philosophical underpinning of this movie that makes it touch the fiber of every man is the love of a father, and how that can help frame one's destiny.Captured on a backdrop of beautiful breathtaking scenery a love story evolves amidst the volatile uncertainty of the 60s. Lee's direction is terse and laconic. There are no opportunities for you to dwell on melodrama. He doesn't allow it. As an audience member, you feel each moment of this movie, whether it's the first night in the tent, or twenty years later when Jack admits he can't shake his love for Ennis. You have been prepped and disarmed to soak each moment as just thata moment in time that's not yours, as much as it is the characters on the screen. You don't want the movie to end. You don't want them to leave each other. You don't want them to leave the mountain, but with the same inevitability of them having to relinquish their expectant hold on each other, you hold on to the idea that maybe they were right, and the rest of the people around them were wrong.As Jonathan Rose in Myles' book, ""Hate Crimes"" asked ""What are the three most important, and perhaps the three most misunderstood words in a relationship?"" The reader, as well as the movie goer encounters these words by understanding as Rose in Myles' book understands it's about, ""Having no expectations. You expect the person who tells you I love you, that they love you too. You place a condition on something that should be unconditional. The most important thing to remember here, is that the first 'having no expectations,' is cognitive. You must first think the phrase like you would a new language. The second is self-actualizing. By understanding the phrase, verbalizing it through your understanding, you can then act accordingly. You tie yourselves in knots my limiting your partners, or prospective partners within your parameters, as opposed to allowing them to be free to teach you, and carry you to new dimensions, or share old ones with them."" This movie will tie you in knots and make you think about relationships in a totally different unexpectant context.Heath Ledger's acting is as understated as the majesty of the azure skies of Brokeback Mountain. By contrast, Gyllenhaal's direct aggressive approach toward Jack complements the sullen Ennis. By allowing himself to be overwhelmed, Gyllenhaal is overwhelming as he brutally assaults his inward demons whether it's through a kiss, unrepentant embrace, or castigating an overbearing father-in-law who's never been put in his place. You never feel either Ledger or Gyllenhaal is acting. Not even when Ennis overwhelmingly assaults Jack after not seeing him for four years under the barest of concealment of a staircase where Ennis now lives with his wife and two daughters, one of the more pivotal points in the movie.This is a man's movie, but a complete review of this movie would be incomplete without mentioning the supporting female cast. Each in their own way, add a dimension that forces the audience to empathize and commiserate with Ennis and Jack. Michelle Williams is probably the standout as she gives men something to hate, when we really want someone to understand us and let us be. On the other hand, I was particularly moved by Linda Cardellini, who becomes Ennis' girlfriend after his divorce. Not on the screen as much as Michelle Williams, Cardellini causes the audience to whimper for both her and Ennis as she is the most fragile and redeeming of the women drawn here. Unable to understand being shut out of Ennis' life, her one tear toward the end of the movie qualifies her as Shakespearean a tragedienne as Eileen Prescott in Myles' 'Hate Crimes' novel. Likewise, as haunting and unforgettable are the few chosen words and expressions Jack's mother offers Ennis before providing him with a brown paper bag for his own.Finally, what makes this a man movie for me is Jack's dad. Unlike Jack, Jack's father had no expectations of his son. He loved him as deeply as men in those days were silent about loving, even their own sons. That's what makes this movie a tragically beautiful true to life story. I will not destroy the ending, but the scene with Jack's father was to me, one of the more poignant and spoke volumes about acceptance, affirmation and the accountability that good fathers need to have of themselves to make sure they raise sons that love themselves. Go see it, 'without expectations.' You won't soon forget it.",Brokeback Mountain

1220,wwwcomedycircus,A legendary movie of life time,10,6 March 2017,"What's love? Does it have boundaries? Does it fade with time? Can it be controlled? All these questions have been beautifully touched by Ang Lee's poignant movie Brokeback Mountain. The story demolishes the myth of stereotypical definition of love between two opposite genders & is also not a same sex cow boy love story as few critics have written it as. It's about the bond, the unstoppable longing between two men which only deepens with time to such an extent that they ""find it hard to quit"" on each other. The movie is extremely heart wrenching & leaves an indelible impression of hurt, longing & melancholy. Their casual encounter & daily routine as 2 Shepards in a farm amidst mountains takes an eventful turn in a fateful cold night when they unknowingly enter into a bodily relationship. After that, there's no looking back. Eventually they part ways, get married with two girls & father kids but after a gap of 4 years when they meet, their love gushes out like roaring turbulent water out of gates of a dam. Ennis played by Heath Ledger sacrifices his marriage but Jack played by Jake Gyllenhaal keeps his forbidden love secret. They continue meeting each other under the brokeback mountain, the place where they spent their early days & their love & longing deepens so much that they find hard to stand each others absence. This clandestine relationship continues for 15 years or so until the death of Jack(murdered by his own wife) tears them apart. The scene where Ennis goes to Jack's parental house to collect his ashes and finds Jack's jacket wrapped around his old shirt can wreck your soul. The way ageing, lonely Ennis with tear filled heavy eyes, sniffs the jacket of his soul mate is enough to shake the pride of even most stoic person. ""How lonely remaining days of Ennis' life would be without his love"" must have crossed every viewers mind. The impeccable direction, passionate storytelling & most importantly the brilliant & flawless acting by two actors make it a legendary movie of all times. No wonder numerous big awards including three Oscars are not tribute big enough for such a fabulous movie. Heath ledger, however couldn't convert best actor nomination into a win though he truly deserved it. He made up for this lacuna after winning Oscars for his iconic portrayal of joker in ""The dark night"" posthumously. Brokeback Mountain is a must watch for all class of people who want to feel what true love is like. It's the best tribute to my favourite Heath Ledger.",Brokeback Mountain
1221,one-louder,Cinematic breakthrough - await similar films.,8,11 December 2006,"From the first scene to the last I was gripped by this film. As a narrative 'Brokeback' offered so much in terms of originality and it is for this reason I feel other film makers have a well made path for same sex romance movies. Homosexuality has been the subject of ridicule in many films. Also films utilise the token homosexual as a side narrative to the 'Sally' and the 'Harry'. Hanks played a man suffering with AIDs in Philedelphia, in my opinion portraying the dark side of homosexuality. It was refreshing to see two A-list stars play out this story centred around homosexuality.Set in the American West this film contradicts our perceptions of Westerns. Audiences are used to seeing Wayne and Eastwood display remorseless testosterone on the plains. Ang Lee creates this world of remote loneliness, where the stigmas created by society do not apply. Ledger and Gyllenhaal portray two men so scarred by the attitudes of homosexuality in 1965 that they reluctantly refuse to 'out' themselves as lovers. Instead they retreat to Brokeback Mountain where they fulfil their true desires. As a whole this film portrays a realistic story of how American society at the time refused to accommodate these two men and their raw emotions.The story plays out to an endearing soundtrack that musically connotes the slow moving nature of the American West and the loneliness that encompasses it. I was left numb by the film and I await other, less daring film makers, to utilise a ready made path of cinematic acceptance for such narratives. More to the point I look forward to it.",Brokeback Mountain
1222,apfel8054,Real love between people,9,16 February 2006,"Admirable director, fantastic scenery, great love story, and excellent actor! I'm waiting for so long time to watch Brokeback Mountain,and it doesn't let me down. The movie depicted true love between peoples,not just for two men. The love here is beyond the gender. In the film, the affection of Jack and Ennis last over 20 years. It symbolizes forever in the real life.The film was realistic but the love it represent is ideal. I was thinking may be every single person is longing for this perfect love, but under the real-life pressure not many of them could make it. The whole film is covered by low sentiment and make the audiences feel sad for the lovers all the time, except the bright beautiful mountain scenery is impressive. And Ledger's performance is real and touching. It's really not a gay western movie, Ang Lee is a marvelous magician who used the uncommon subject to represent the most common theme successfully.",Brokeback Mountain
1223,johnkitchener,Updated: It is one of the finest films produced in recent memory,10,26 December 2005,"Thank you, director Ang Lee, for your cinematic gift. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is one of the finest films produced in recent memory. This is an absolutely honest film about realistic love and the ecstasies and sorrows it provokes in the era it is set. 26 year old actor Heath Ledger is given the role of a lifetime and Lee's perfect restraint and the cinematographer's careful lighting fully capture the essence of Ledger's character. Jake Gyllenhaal as also extraortdinary. Michelle Williams (playing Ledger's wife) and Roberta Maxwell (Jack's mother) deserved Oscar wins. It's sad, heartwarming, very honest and ultimately makes us think. I've now seen Brokeback Mountain five times. It is still stunning and remarkable on many levels. Ang Lee's carefully crafted restraint of Annie Proulx's short story makes this my favorite film ever. No film I have seen is so utterly compelling. Correction from my earlier comment: it is an independent film gem and not a product of homophobic Hollywood. Despite its absurd loss at the Oscars, BBM has won every world award as best picture and deservedly. Lastly, thank you, Diana Ossana, for your tenacious gift to make BBM a cinematic reality. God bless Brokeback Mountain. It lives on forever.",Brokeback Mountain
1224,miss-bloom,amazing,10,28 August 2008,"i watched this earlier today and i have to say that this movie is absolutely AMAZING. it's a lot like ""Romeo and Juliet"" in the sense that the two main characters are not allowed to be together even though they love each other so much. it shows you how in that time gay people had to hide themselves from everyone else either by forgetting about how they are or ignoring it and marrying and having kids. Heath Ledger gives a wonderful performance as a young cowboy who is in denial about who he is but is so clearly in love. Jake Gylenhall gives an amazing performance as the one who doesn't see why they should have to hide how they feel and has dreams of the two of them one day owning a ranch together.",Brokeback Mountain

1226,mgagne2002,a great journey,10,25 December 2005,"I have seen this movie for the second time yesterday. I'm literally obsessing over it. This movie speaks about loss and all of us, no matter how happy or how successful our lives, have endured losses; it speaks of regrets and we all have regrets about things said or done that we wish could be unsaid and undone. Choices not made for fear of the perceived consequences. This movie, the way it was crafted, is like a mirror where everyone can see themselves. It reflects both the ugliness of the world as well as its beauty, no matter how ephemeral it may be. In a sense it's almost a spiritual experience.The pacing was like a tide, insidious but relentless, with each element (music, photography, editing) reinforcing it and each other. And as for the acting the chemistry was palpable in every shot. And of course there's Heath ledger... I don't know where he went to find everything he put in the part, after all, up until now he was just a pretty boy with limited talent, but here he was simply phenomenal.Some found BBMountain boring... Well it's certainly different from the drivel coming out of Hollywod with such dreadful regularity. How long was it since you were haunted by a story ? See it and judge for yourselves.G.",Brokeback Mountain
1227,garryrrstewart,Cinema grows up again...,10,13 June 2006,"An exquisite exercise in how tasteful, yet powerful; how understated, and yet visceral cinema can still be. This has a purity that perhaps outshines the rough-diamond original prose-piece- itself brilliant. Ledger's performance stands alongside the very best of Brando, De Niro or Pacino for sheer silent muscularity yet tenderness. Heart rending in its reality and surprises- it's tiny revelations and it's nuances. Why did he not get the plaudits at the awards ceremonies? Gyllenhaal mirrors his strengths, but in a marginally less dimensioned way. Together under Ang Lees guiding hand they say as many things about love and the human condition as any 2 hour stretch of movie has managed in the last 50 years. Cinematography, score and script are crystalline in their perfection. A masterpiece that feeds emotion and intellect. Stunning! Tremendously sad news to hear of Heath Ledger's death. His performance, here alone, will secure his position amongst the very best actors to bring the screen alive.",Brokeback Mountain
1228,pugstwo2,The Best,10,15 January 2006,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long, long time - as much as I liked it while sitting in the theatre it kept hitting me later in the day how powerful and moving it was. The acting is excellent, the scenery is breathtaking and it was done with such emotion and sensitivity. I am glad this is a love story - and no gratuitous sex or violence was added - it would have taken away from the meaning. I wish those who condemn this movie would see it - it is not at all what some close-minded people think it is. It is a story of human emotions - not something exploitative. With so many other movies that contain meaningless sex and terrible violence it amazes me that such a beautiful love story draws such criticism.",Brokeback Mountain
1229,berrystiles,Not a love story,4,2 January 2006,"If you want to see a wonderful love story, DO NOT see Brokeback Mountain. This movie is based on a short story. That is no surprise to me. IT IS a short story. Heath Ledger is playing a character we have seen over and over again. (The Patriot, Monster's Ball) I understand what he is trying to do with his character, but he just comes off as cold and unfeeling. Jake Gyllenhaal's acting is wonderful. Unfortunately he has little to work with. The second half of the movie drags on and tries, without accomplishment, to pull at your heartstrings. The movie has a chance to redeem itself(and give you what you came to see) at the very end but fails completely to hit the mark.",Brokeback Mountain
1230,secretary_of_funk,Hollywood teaches us to love again in the New Year...,9,20 January 2006,"December is a lover's month, or at least it's recognized in Hollywood like that. A slough of cinematic romances flood your local megaplex and art-house alike, ranging from the delightful treacly comedy (The Family Stone, Rumor Has It) to lavish period pieces (Casanova, Tristan & Isolde)...not to mention the obligatory ape-meets-girl blockbuster (King Kong).And then, there's Brokeback Mountain, a shining example of the duality between the progressive contemporary love story and the tale as old as time. Forbidden love has been at the center of the film romance since the birth of the medium. The previously mentioned Tristan & Isolde bases its marketing off of it. But what makes ""Brokeback"" different is its ability to make its audience care about every character's struggle. Unlike ""Isolde"", in which King Mark, the man Isolde is promised to, becomes an antagonist, or even the most famous forbidden love story of all, Romeo & Juliet, where the suitor Paris is written as one-dimensional, the wives and families of the men in ""Brokeback"" carry just as much complexity and vulnerability as its protagonists.The ability to bring such complex characters to life is not only the doing of director Ang Lee, but of the actors as well. Almost every emotion is registered through the eyes; in one glance you can read a mind or see a heart breaking. As the brooding cowboy Ennis Del Mar, Heath Ledger says little, but can create many different emotions at once and layer on the subtext through his facial expressions...he has certainly come a long way since his serenade of Julia Stiles in The 10 Things I Hate About You. While Ledger has received the most critical acclaim for his role, Jake Gyllenhaal's impassioned portrayal of the wide-eyed rodeo kid Jack Twist is not to be overlooked. The women in the film give stunning performances, each with their own distinctions and complexities, particularly Michelle Williams as Ennis's heartbroken wife, Alma.In addition to its raw passion and heartbreak, ""Brokeback"" is an aesthetic masterpiece, with sweeping scenes of the Wyoming mountain ranges that can even transform a herd of sheep into a flowing current. While the pacing is slow and deliberate through most of the film, the fast-paced editing during the rawer, graphic scenes adds to the heart-pounding sense that this is not a Hollywood love story, but raw, tragic reality.Brokeback Mountain's tagline is ""Love Is a Force of Nature"", and the natural wonders seen in the background as Jack and Ennis slowly fall for each other prove that love is just that...a natural wonder.",Brokeback Mountain
1231,Oscar_Addict,Powerful,10,6 March 2006,"""Brokeback Mountain"" and ""CRASH"" were two of my favorite films this year, and ""Brokeback"" easily surpasses the stylish, yet choppy ""Crash."" Never before has a bitter wife and two forbidden lovers graced the screen with such beauty! Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal star as two ranchers hired for a summer's work. A cold night brings them together, and the narrow minded society that the live in tears them apart. Heath Ledger delivers a truly haunting performance as Ennis Del Mar! Supporting him is Jake Gyllenhaal who plays optimist Jack Twist. Michelle Williams proves she come a long way since ""Dawsons Creek"" and manages to keep up with her costars beautifully! One of the most intense scenes in the movie revolves around a Thanksgiving dinner. In this scene, I not only felt sympathy to Ennis's forbidden love, but also towards Alma (Williams) broken heart. ""Brokeback Mountain"" has everything that a great movie should have: Love, tragedy, a few laughs, and a story that shook the nation!",Brokeback Mountain
1232,shaleina03,Oscar Worthy,10,30 December 2005,"This movie was amazing! Jake Gyllenhaal deserves an Oscar for this. I was skeptical about weather or not they would be able to pull of being homosexuals, but they both did it wonderfully, especially Jake. I honesty believed that they were in love. There was a brief amount of nudity, both male and female, but it was all done in a very tasteful manner, as were the love scenes. Nothing to revealing or grotesque. It is a tear jerker though, so bring tissue or a big sleeve, you will need it. I could honestly feel the pain and longing that the characters were feeling. The movie deserves an Oscar, as does Jake Gyllenhaal! If you want to watch a provocative, truly unique movie--then this is the one!",Brokeback Mountain
1233,richardjsnyder,Cineme Verite,9,13 December 2005,"Having read Proulx short story, I was eager to see how Ang Lee would translate this to the big screen. The wait for this movie has been long - critics have been discussing it for nearly 2 years, and most of the gay community has awaited a good film that deals with love and romance with good acting (a rarity in this genre). So, when I received two free tickets to an advance screening, I couldn't drive to the theatre fast enough.Lee creates a story that is both visually spectacular and real. Brutally real. Ennis del Mar and Jack Twist fall in love in 1963 despite their best efforts. Going against tradition, culture, and even impending marriage, they begin a multi-decade relationship that is anything but idyllic. They surround themselves with doubt, lust, deception, longing, tenderness, and even violence. The rough landscape of Wyoming echoes the roughness of their lives together and, more noticeably, apart.Gyllenhal is believable as Jack Twist, less afraid of life than his lover, Ennis. He is ready to meet critics head on, wanting a life together with his other half, not caring about convention or fear. Gyllenhal, though, is the true star of the film. You really see his inward torture of wanting to be loved, but not knowing how to give it. His moments shine in the film as you suffer being in love with him.The only criticism would be that the film departs from Proulx's original work at times. But what is added truly complements the plot of the film. You feel that if Proulx had turned the short story into a novella, then she would have included the extra details.This is a must see - for anyone (gay or straight) who has wanted something so much, but feeling like he or she could never have it.",Brokeback Mountain
1234,FromTheDarkCorner,Wake Up!,5,17 January 2006,"Brokeback Mountain A film hailed to be a masterpiece and a classic, but in reality nothing but a sign of mainstream tolerance in the gay debate Hollywood have finally managed to make a film that openly deals with the theme of gay love - outside Hollywood it's been going on for ages and I could mention a lot of films, dealing with the same theme that does it much better But hey, Brokeback Mountain is, being a commercial American Movie coming straight out of the factory - better than average, but still very far from being a masterpiece.I found the beginning of the film very slow. What especially annoys me, was that I never got that there was a growing romantic and erotic tension building up between the two main characters  (Jack hints an interest in Ennis the first scene) but otherwise it's not really shown except their fighting, before suddenly on a chilly night, after some whiskey  the two men jump on each other, inside their beat-up tent  a scene I found rather awkward and rough and with absolute no deep felt desire or affection going on between themAnd from there it goes on, but I didn't at any time believe that there was that strong feelings between them, and also it seemed obvious that the director was very far from his subject, with the result that the characters like the film as a whole, seemed far too superficial to either be believable or movingThe acting from the two main characters was good though it was very hard to understand what exactly Ennis is saying, but maybe that's on purpose? Another thing was the ageing of the characters, it was surprisingly good but questionable  especially the belly Jack developed with time looked very fake and his wife still in her late 30s looking like a teenager, just wearing a bad wig?In general the film is beautifully crafted, but I don't see any artistic quality or anything groundbreaking about it and therefore it makes no sense to me that it received the Golden Lion at Venice film festival last year! It is of no surprise to me though - all the American awards it has already won, (like the Golden Globe), and I expect more to come, like the Academy Awards, because that's an entirely different ballgame isn't itA last comment I'd like to make and maybe it's just because I'm a pathetic European and a big fan of European and International/Art-house cinema, but why did Ang Lee have to use the song ""Perhaps or Quisaz"" in the scene where Jack goes to Mexico to get laid? To me, that made a very clear reference, to two recent films containing exactly the same themes as Brokeback Mountain. One is Almodovar's Bad Education (gay love) and the other one is Wong Kar Wai's In the Mood for Love (forbidden and unfulfilled love). But where as in the two titles just mentioned, the song is used very clever and really ad's to the characters emotions and the whole tension in the film, in Brokeback Mountain it doesn't do anything, it just seems so inappropriate and meaningless",Brokeback Mountain
1235,songofdavid,"An Ang Lee masterpiece, featuring a superb performance by Heath Ledger",10,15 December 2005,"This is Ang Lee's finest film...This is a love story which defies genre and gender expectations. Yes, it's about two men whose hearts surreptitiously journey from unbridled, young passion to tried and tested true love, albeit marred in many ways, albeit secretive and carefully protected from external influence, and albeit unduly subjected to the harsh reality of the star-crossed lovers' torrential emotions, their fears, and their uncertainty about what's practical, reasonable, and acceptable--and what isn't.I can't help but rave about Heath Ledger's rough-and-tough-but-tender-and-vulnerable performance. A tour de force! In fact, he is so believable that very little make-up was required in order to try to convince the audience that he is aging right before our eyes. As you watch him, you really do believe that this taciturn young roughneck is actually becoming a middle-aged man who is coming to terms with day to day responsibilities, family life, and an ever-present, nagging, burning need to hold onto a love that will not let him go (Sorry, couldn't resist that phrase).If you are straight, and you are convinced that this is a gay film for gay people, you are missing out on a timeless, transcendent, universal tale about love, triumphant and tragic.Michelle Williams deserves a Best Supporting Actress nod, without a doubt.

1236,danranshi,Absolute Masterpiece,10,16 January 2006,"This movie is an absolute masterpiece-- the actors, the casting, the scenery, the script, the acting, everything is perfect. It is a deeply moving film that touches your heart with the story of true love, lasting for an endless time-span. It breaks your heart, but it won't let go with a kind of euphoria... for you are able to dive deep into the story. You become part of the love of two men, and the yearnings to be together that can't be fulfilled entirely... it leaves you crying for days, as all the images will keep coming back in a series of intense flashbacks.It's a story of two cowboys, Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar, who fall in love in one beautiful summer of Brokeback Mountain. Their love is unexpected and sudden to both, it hits like the sudden snow on the mountain-- and it burns them like fire that warms them on the cold nights that summer. Neither really resists this sudden birth of passion because they are all alone, accompanied only by the beautiful nature that surrounds them. This beauty only helps their profound intimacy and tenderness for each other to grow. Of course, later the force of society's intolerance begins to take hold... but they always go back to the mountain, to free themselves from the tiresomeness of society and to treasure the love that was born, and the love that continues to grow. I was on a constant high during the movie, and completely mesmerized. It's a quiet, deep kind of sadness that enters you. it's a true love story and one that won't let go. To me a good movie is something that won't let go (sometimes I wish it would, but it won't) in a, shall I say, good way-- it won't let go because you become so emotionally involved and you become part of the emotional experience, part of the love, pain, yearnings, everything that is felt during the movie.Both actors (Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger) are absolutely gorgeous, very sensual, and very real. I believe that Jake Gyllenhaal and Hearth Ledger should both have been considered the best actors because they are just incredible. I admire everyone who was part of this movie-making process for creating such a masterpiece... it is a work that takes you to another world, a fascinating dimension of intense love, passion, and endless longing.",Brokeback Mountain

1238,kirkmusic,Artistically repressed emotion,10,29 December 2005,"The spoilers don't come until the third paragraph. So if you haven't seen the movie, feel free to read up until then. And then you can jump down to the conclusion.The thing about Brokeback Mountain that a lot of people seem to have had a problem with was the fact that the emotion of the film was as subtle and unspoken as the emotions of the main characters. Rather than taking that as a dull, slow moving movie I took it as a stylistic choice that worked phenomenally well. In describing the movie to friends I told them not to expect the ""best film of the year"" while they were in the theatre. For me it wasn't the kind of thing that knocks you out immediately. But I couldn't take my mind off of it for several days after seeing it.The great strength of the way the story was told is that nothing was as you've come to expect it. There's no big promise-of-eternal-love scene. There's no tragic separation scene. It really doesn't give you any great opportunities to cry. No tears jerked here. In spite of the hype regarding the subject matter, the ""gayness"" is really downplayed. The word ""love"" is used only once at the very end, and not regarding the two leads. There isn't even very much dialogue to tell you what the characters are feeling. It's all told in the situations and on the faces of four extraordinary actors.Spoilers start now.Heath Ledger would be a shoe-in for a Best Actor Oscar had this film been released in a year without Capote. How do we know what Ennis is feeling when he never tells us? He vomits when his first season with Jack is over. He looks only mildly happy to be getting married at his wedding. He's prone to fits of rage. He completely ignores his wife whenever Jack is in the vicinity. Thanks to a traumatic childhood experience and an intolerant environment, he's denying who he is and what he wants and it effects everything, even the way he talks (I thought the mumbling was a perfect acting choice). Jake Gyllenhaal's character was not so internal, and therefore didn't require the level of skill that Ledger's performance did. It's still great. Jack's frustration with ""something that I need so bad and can't hardly get"" is painfully evident. Everyone seems to be in agreement on Michelle Williams spectacular performance, but Anne Hathaway isn't getting the props I think she deserves. The scene on the phone between her and Ledger is a classic. You can see her inner conflict as she talks to the person she knows her husband, with whom she shared an amiable yet unfulfilling marriage, really loved. Amazing. And kudos to Ang Lee and film editors Geraldine Peroni and Dylan Tichenor for bringing such a sense of intimacy to that and many other scenes.No more spoilers from here on out.And don't even get me started on the score and cinematography! Beautiful! This is an unconventional love story told in a completely unconventional way. It's a shame that the hype will have viewers going in with so many expectations. If you let it take you on the journey it was designed to, rather than the one you expect, you're in for an engaging movie-going experience like none other in the last several years.",Brokeback Mountain
1239,xdreamfly,a rite of passage for characters and a viewer,10,2 October 2006,"""Words get in a way of communication"", said Exupery in Little Prince. This is how I feel about the film: it is indescribable, it has to be felt. If you get to this review, you probably know what the film is about, but to feel it through is worth much more, so watch it and judge for yourself. We are taken through many different emotions: joy, longing, anger, confusion, despair, and regret are among many. And most people can relate to at least a few of those, no matter what age, gender, race, sex orientation, religion or political views they hold. Here is the impact the film had on me: interestingly, the first night I watched it (at home on DVD) I thought it was a well-made tragic story with superb acting, and so on, I did not cry, I went to sleep... Woke up next day unable to concentrate on anything else, as it was slowly sinking in deeper and deeper, to the core of my humanity. By the daytime I was devastated, replaying parts of it and thinking about my own life and only a handful moments of raw emotions (blissful and aching) that I experienced, emotions unmixed with its' ""yang"" of rationality and logic. Emotions that shake you and take you on a rite of passage, and after you are not the same again. The next night I got up at 2am and saw it again, this time crying over tragedies of human existence (imagine a story being told from Ennis's wife's point of view, or daughter, etc.); and thats the whole thing: it's not a good guys vs. bad guys type of film; If only life was that simple!.. This film became personal. And in fact, I am reluctant of recommending it to my husband, friends, and family, since I know that either negative comments or indifference on their part might shatter my image of THEM. Thank you, cast and crew for this rite of passage.",Brokeback Mountain
1240,yao_b05,"Treasure in the ""Mountain""",10,8 February 2006,"Thinking about a movie, a good love story, some words often come to my mind: romantic, beautiful, lyric, sweet, eloquent, decent, enjoyable, touching, moving, thought-provoking, sad, heartbreaking, powerful, haunting, just to name a few. The greater a movie, the more the words can be used to describe it. Could all these words reflect one's feeling to one movie, indeed, it is really rare. Yet, Brokeback Mountain is just this kind of movie, and may be the only one according to my over 45-years of movie-watching experience. I especially appreciated the movie's pace to make me fully get the so many feelings. Kudos to every one involved in this film. God bless American people.",Brokeback Mountain
1241,walter-heape,Love In Itself,10,20 December 2005,"Ang Lee's interpretation of Proulx's beautiful short story is breathtaking. I admired ""The Ice Storm"" for it's cold, simplistic portrayal of emotion on film. I had read that Brokeback Mountain marked Lee's return to this aesthetic but I had no idea how sublime his rendition would be.Brokeback Mountain is a story about two men in love. Simply, Heath Ledger's ""Ennis"" is a down and out drifter with a sad past and a handicap for the art of conversation. Jake Gyllenhaal's ""Jack"" is a dormant homosexual with a warm heart and a desire to understand his passion. The two meet in hopes of a little cash and a job for the summer. What ensues is a romance not unlike the ones we all fantasize about. Alone and safe in nature, the two are free to explore, and unload, all that is left behind.Unlike most love stories in cinema, in reality we are not defined by our gushing declarations of love but in everything we guard about ourselves in the pursiut of it. This film is about protection and the spaces in between words. Gesture and facial expression tell the tale more than words themselves.Look closely at Heath Ledger's face throughout this film and tell me that everything about the story is not contained in that face. There is such a weight to it. It's absolutely heartbreaking.Jake Gyllenhaal's character is also one that we can identify with. His Jack is hopelessly in love with something he ultimately can't have. I think we've all be there at some point in our lives. His character did what many would do in his predicament. Without giving too much of himself away, he lets Ennis know just how much he loves him. There is no breakdown, no pleading on his part. He subtly emotes ""I love you and I don't know what I'd do without you"". It is Ennis that we see having the gut-wrenching breakdowns. In this I see the genius of the character study. Some are so confident in their love for another that they have no qualms about expressing it, no matter the outcome. Others opt to play it cool, too cool in fact that their emotions eventually overcome them in a way that is unhealthy and destructive.This is why I see this film universally appealing. We've all been here in relationships. We all know these confusing, devastating situations. The fact that the story is about two men in love should be an aside, a non-issue.I know that Brokeback Mountain will touch many people and, hopefully, those who are the slightest bit open will get a glimpse of what love really is. We all have the potential to understand this film. If you are human it is in you.",Brokeback Mountain
1242,DrewjWeHoCA,One of the best films of all time,10,21 December 2005,"Being a big Ang Lee fan, as well as a fan of Jake Gyllenhaal, I was thrilled the day I heard of this film going into production. So much so that I was afraid my expectations were going to be set so high that I was somewhat afraid I might be let down by the final result. Not so. Everything about it is wonderful - acting, cinematography, direction, etc. I don't just say ""10 out of 10"" - this film really deserves it - and, in a year where there were actually quite a few great movies, I do hope it wins Best Picture.(I don't consider this a spoiler, as it gives nothing away regarding the storyline - but does go into the extent of gay intimacy in the film, and my opinions regarding that.) As a gay man, I found the scenes of intimacy to be very tame. It's Wyoming in the 60's, and this sort of thing is even more taboo than it still is today. Somewhat of a ridiculous understatement, then again - given Matthew Shepard's murder only a few years ago, well... I heard of a straight couple in Manhattan saying it ""turned into a gay porn"". To me, this is completely ludicrous, and couldn't be further from the truth. Granted, this straight couple probably hasn't watched gay porn, but there are probably a total of 2 minutes (if that) of ""sex scenes"", none of which are incredibly graphic. So gay people going expecting that might be let down, but I think it's appropriate - given the time and setting. There are further - but again, not much - scenes of intimacy, discussions of affection, etc. So if you're one of those people who is going to be disgusted, giggle, whatever at the mere sight of two men kissing or discussing love - please stay home. The people who do want to see this movie don't want you there. Although it's somewhat frightening to think Manhattanites were ""shocked"" by the content, that was one couple. I think this movie really could change some minds, and hope that enough people get to see it, such that this can be accomplished. At the same time, I find it offensive when people who are anti-gay post negative reviews without even seeing the film. I know this happens - both here and elsewhere. A person wrote a letter to The Los Angeles Times taking the film to task for ""glamorizing the gay lifestyle"" (among other things). Had this person actually seen the film, he would realize it hardly ""glamorizes"" being gay. I highly doubt if any child (of course, it's rated ""R"", so presumably kids won't be seeing it), or young adult - is going to watch this movie, and based on that, ""decide"" to be gay. I've seen the film 3 times - once with a Q&A with Ang Lee, and once with Jake Gyllenhaal, and I intend to see it again in a week with friends who have not yet seen it.Drew - West Hollywood, CA",Brokeback Mountain

Anybody not prepared and even a little emotional at movies bring Puffs. It is simply amazing from the acting to the setting. Anybody who watches it and complains about it not be shot in Wyoming is stupid. The entire movie was so well done that I can't find the words. I was unable to see it till it released near me this past weekend, and I have been waiting since 12/09/05 to see it. It was well worth the wait. If anybody is on the fence about going to see, I beg you get off it and go see it. The depth and sincerity of the love between the character does truly move you.",Brokeback Mountain

1245,rpmnh03062,This movie profoundly affected me,10,30 December 2005,"I absolutely loved this movie. It touched my heart and soul in a profound way.It stayed with me for days and I could not stop mulling it over in my head. I have been trying to analyze why I (and others, from what I have been reading in chat boards etc.) have been experiencing such an intense reaction. Here is a partial explanation, from my point of view. I think that most people have experienced at one point in their lives, the intense, aching, longing love for another that cannot be fully realized, for whatever reason, as skillfully portrayed in Brokeback. This feeling touches the core of one's being and that feeling was palpable between the lead characters in Brokeback, even though it was not always explicitly expressed. The brilliant conveyance of such emotion is a tribute to the director and lead actors. My sense is that deeply connecting with the audience is what most serious actors and directors continually strive for in their work. To attain it to this extent is remarkable and laudable and what makes this movie ""great."" A few random observations: While watching the movie, I had hoped that Ennis would open up and express his affection and feelings more readily. Upon reflection, though, I have realized that such emoting would not be true to the character, who was conflicted, fearful and raised in a environment that was not generally hospitable to men expressing themselves in such a manner, especially with another man. The lack of verbal expression, though, did not prevent the feelings from being conveyed, at least to the audience. Also, I was surprised how strongly I felt for Ennis' wife and how difficult it must have been for her to live in the situation, knowing what she did. I also could feel Jack's frustration, due to the fact that he was more ready and less inhibited than Ennis to move forward with their relationship.I left the theater somewhat morose, but took away an uplifting life lesson as well, which was the central message of the movie, for me. That is, to not let fear inhibit love in your life, in whatever form it may appear.",Brokeback Mountain
1246,ohong,painful and beautiful all at once...,10,1 January 2006,"The fact that I have signed up to write this review speaks volumes... as much as the fact that I have read the last 32 pages of reviews before deciding to add my two cents.This is a movie that I had been anticipating to watch since I saw the trailers earlier in the year for a couple of reasons. The first because the great Ang Lee was coming out with a new film and the story intrigued me.This story has resonated with me the way that it has with all of the reviewers that I have read so far and I echo their sentiments in that it haunts you long after you have left the theater.To love and lost or never loved at all, is the question that I posed my friend that I saw the film with on my first viewing. Her answer was simple... to love and lost. I asked that question because of the fact that Ennis' pain at the end of the film is so apparent that you wonder if it was worth it but you realize that it is completely out of his control. Another important question for me that this movie brought to mind the second time that I watched it was the role that fear brought to Ennis and how it stopped him from fulfilling his own happiness with Jack.The performances were exquisite and Ang Lee is a genius for bringing us this remarkable and haunting love story.It is quite obvious that this film has resonated with a cord in the majority of the viewing public, and we all have our own views on what that is. This love story was heartbreaking, gut wrenching, but beautiful and thought provoking at the same time. I highly recommend that you go see this film and leave what you think you may know about this film at the door and be prepared to be brought into the tragic and forbidden love of Ennis DelMar and Jack Twist.",Brokeback Mountain
1247,mrflaleather05,Finally a gay movie that has masculine men,10,13 February 2006,"Many many masculine homosexual men have become weary of the queening of Gay America. Everywhere we turn we see homosexual men portrayed as feminized queens, men who act in drag, with wigs, in heels, (Priscilla, Queen of the Dessert, To Wong Foo, Birdcage, etc). Finally, a movie has been produced that captures the hearts and minds of what gay men not only experience, but as they really are. We're men, not queens! All that masculine gay men want from the media is to portray us as we really are, and not screaming queens to giggle, camp it up or are typified by Will & Grace, Queer Eye for the Straight Guy (damn, those characters have set gay men back decades!), or Sex & the City gay characters.We are men. We are cowboys. We are firefighters. We are policemen. We are soldiers. We are everywhere and we are just like regular men.We just are oriented for intimacy with other men. that's it!Kudos to this fantastic cast, producers and directors, and all those individuals who helped with this brilliant film.

I loved Jack's character and Ennis' younger daughter. Thanks for a great, great movie.ToniSuch an excellent, moving, and touching movie that I will remember. Both actors Jake Gylenhaal and Heath Ledger delivered their Oscar-worthy performances. Michelle William's performance as the loving, and suffering wife shows how us that her quiet acting spoke a thousand words than a dialog can. The cinematography and direction are poignant, touched me in my heart of emotions. A true love story in all facets; including a parent's love for their children. Bravo!!!Sally",Brokeback Mountain
1249,riotgirl_5,Amazing,10,4 January 2006,"I don't care who's falling in love with who-this story is amazing. I had previously read the book (5 times) and i cried every time. The movie was very emotional and had really good, talented, fresh actors in it. For those who are against gays or whatever, that's fine, but please see the movie or read the book before you run off and say that ""god made Adam and eve...not Adam and Steve..."". Everyone is entitled to their own opinions but come on, you should probably see it before you write a horrid review for it...Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger are both really emotional and excellent actors who provided me and all of my friends with a really fantastic performance. As far as i could tell, everyone in the theater was crying (including me..^_^)! Yeah, sure, so i cried in Air Bud, but that was different. This movie punches you in the stomach with this sadness...and then laughs in your face. I strongly recommend it-and please DO NOT JUDGE IT!! Jake Gyllenhaal ROCKS!",Brokeback Mountain
1250,gordon_gillies,A love story above all,10,25 February 2006,"Where does one start? With the beautiful Wyoming mountain scenery? With the beautiful Jake Gyllenhaal? With the desperate plight of 2 gay men in a society that will ill judge them if they are true to themselves? Ang Lee has produced a cinematic masterpiece which is as thought provoking as it is beautifully shot. The two principle characters share a passionate and loving summer together on a mountain, protecting a herd of sheep. That tranquil and beautiful experience is about to be shattered, however, as they return from the mountain to the reality of a homophobic society that is just not ready to condone their love for one another. This is not just a gay movie, it is a study of relationships and how they both restrain us and allow us to flourish.",Brokeback Mountain
1251,p-latourdr,The Fourth of July scene,10,4 January 2006,"Words fail me, other than to say this is a great movie- see it in a theater.Well, I've seen it again since I last wrote-- and I really can't get it out of my mind. I've read so many of the hundred or so pages of comment, and the drift is clear-this special film is affecting a huge swath of society. Most of us are blindsided in the theater- we went to see a movie and instead had our lives rearranged by what unfolded on the screen. I bought the soundtrack and had to stop driving to wipe tears from my eyes as the beautiful music evoked the incredible scenery and story. We recall the dialog so well because there is so little of it. And none wasted. I re-read the short story, and half a box of Kleenex later felt that the film is so much more illustrative- having seen it adds to the book. Having read it adds to the film. I rate the film as better than the book.A wonderful scene in the film has not generated much chat: the 4th of July. Ennis stands tall and strong to defend the women and children from the disgusting behavior of two goons. The imagery is not subtle. One shot shows Ennis standing straight (!) and tall, while fireworks go off in the background. He, the gay man, is the man of honor, courage and decency, standing tall while the others,(I don't like to use perjorative language, but most of us would not enjoy the company of these two fellows at home), behave in a way that we all turn away from. Interesting, the contrast between the 'straight' men and the 'gay' man. And the gay men are to be despised? That scene seems to make the point so forcefully.I don't know what it is about this film that has so many of us writing about it. I thank all the others who have made so many thoughtful and heartfelt comments- it seems to deepen and prolong the experience. And, yes, I am going to see it again, on a big screen. And being forewarned about the emotional power of it did not stop the tears the second time around. I'll probably start sobbing next time with the opening credits. Bravo.",Brokeback Mountain
1252,iluvbairs,Great for it's subtleness that says so much,9,5 January 2006,"I saw this movie yesterday with my mom and aunt, and I liked it enough that I saw it again today with one of my friends. This is such a unique movie and brings up so many interesting topics for discussion. Now, I have to admit that a big part of why I first wanted to see this movie is because I love Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. I think that they are so adorable and it's great to see them taking on challenging roles that don't really resemble any roles either has previously played. Now that I've said that, I would like to talk about the movie.WARNING!: Big Spoilers Ahead...so if you have not seen the movie yet, you may not want to read on.This is such a sad story. None of the characters are happy in the long run, but in a lot of ways I feel the worst for Alma. When discussing this movie with my mother she mentioned how in the 60's and 70's (the major time periods in which this movie took place) people used to think that you could turn someone gay, which now we know is crazy, but at that time Alma very likely could have blamed herself and thought that she did something to drive him into the arms of another man. I feel sorry for Jack and Ennis too though. Because of society's bigotry they were too afraid to be with the person they truly loved and therefore had very sad lives. I have several gay male friends and as a straight woman, I can't begin to think I understand what they go through, but I feel like this movie does a good job at showing some of the difficulties gay people may go through. I also want to commend Ang Lee, Jake, and Heath on the love scenes in this movie. There's enough so that people can see the physicality of the relationship and the passion that exists(especially when they share that amazing kiss outside of Ennis' home), but not so much that people would get too distracted from the love story. My friend also pointed out how most relationships start with a strong physical attraction, but as they continue they develop into something that is so much more, which this movie shows, the men grow and talk and share a spiritual connection beyond a sexual interest. This can also be seen in all of the subtle elements Ang put into the movie to show their love. Some of these are like when Jack tries to clean Ennis' head wound, when Jack brushes his hand against Ennis' cheek, when Jack sees Ennis after finding out about the divorce and the way he puts his hand around Ennis' head, then when he breaks down as he drives away, and even more that are too many to list. As I watched those scenes I kept thinking that is so sweet or so cute, just as I did when Ennis and Alma go sledding. All of these parts add so much, even though they are so small. I know that in an interview Jake Gyllenhaal commented on his worry of making the love scenes look authentic, which I think they did. I believed that the men were in love, the only part I thought may have been a little less realistic was when they kissed outside the house and both men kept their hands on the others' face, I would have thought that if making out, a persons hands would usually go down to the shoulders and or waist, but maybe not. Overall, I really liked this movie, which may be because of the hot guys, it may be because I am from a younger generation who has a different understanding and acceptance of homosexuality, or it could just be because it was a really good movie. I also read Annie Proulx's story and this movie really did the story justice. The original story, only about 30 pages, said so much with so few words and the movie does the same. We see the love grow and the relationship form as they are herding the sheep, even though no words, or very few, are being used. I gave this movie a 9/10 only because I feel like the story seems a bit unreal, would the guys really have waited that long to be with each other and could Jack really have visited for that long of a time period that many times a year? I know that is more of a commentary on the story, not the movie, but I still think it's one of those things that can take away from the movie a bit. I said so much already and I still wish I could say more, but the best thing I can say is if you haven't seen the movie yet, see it, because even if you don't enjoy it like I did, it will still provide a lot to talk about.",Brokeback Mountain
1253,nalyn,A must see movie especially for movie critics,10,23 February 2006,"Wonderful! is not enough to describe it. It is yet the most original story I had ever seen. This movie actually gave me a whole new view of gays, they are not only those who feel feminine inside....... I was near to tears at the part when Ennis went to the house of Jack's parents and saw the clothe that Jack wore on the last day that they'd seen each other, I swore I would had cried if not only for the fact that I was with many people at the time. If only the world they were living in is not judgmental and cruel to those like them they would have lead a blissful life together. This movie will make each and everyone of us realize that we are lucky today because we already had the freedom to express ourselves out in the public. Jack and Ennis' tragic love story is an excellent example of the prejudice that gays experienced during old times. Being able to view this one-of-a-kind film was a privilege for me. Ang Lee not only brought out the best from the actors, he also brought out the best about seeing two male cowboys deeply in love with each other. Seriously! I mean, never had I seen a love story, especially between two gays, as beautiful as this. Though I had to admit that I was totally freak out when Jack and Ennis French kissed at the stairway of Jack's house, the scene when Ennis's wife finally discovered the truth. Now that I mentioned it I seem not to remember any love story between gays. Where the hell did Lee got this is one thing i WOULD LOVE TO KNOW.""I wish I know how to quit it"" whoever said this is least important, what matters most is that it struck me to the core. I guess this is the most unforgettable line to those many who had and will watch BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. It isn't because its an original nor is it sweet to hear nor will it move you to heavy emotion, the sole reason that I could guarantee this the fact that no one can control his or her or anyone's emotions. One couldn't control or rather, stop hate or love for whatever reason. Psycologically speaking this is a part of our life. We are living to feel this and undergo the process of discovering the wonders of life. The main truth about the line is that no matter who you are, no matter what you do, no matter how much you reason out you cannot stop yourself from loving a person no matter who he/she is, no matter what he/she did. It may sound absurd but the main fact is we are just human beings, that we do make some mistakes and that sometimes we just cannot control ourselves. This movie apparently showed us that things are not always the way we wanted it to be, that sometimes life is playing tricks on us, that it doesn't care whatever time or circumstance you are in. I am a person who doesn't generally believe in fate even until now that I'd already said this stuff but somehow I believe or wanted to believe there are some forces at work sometimes.Brokeback Mountain did deserve all of its awards especially best picture. Having to view this was a wonderful experienced for me. But we had to admit that young people who are not yet ready for heavy drama is not suit for this, they may find it too boring, they will only like or be amused by scenes where Jack and Ennis french kissed, now that's a part you don't usually witness. Though I am grossed out that Jake and Heath did that kissing scene no matter how original it may be.",Brokeback Mountain
1254,scott-1238,Amazing - Pure Class,10,6 January 2006,"Having started an obsession with this movie in November, I bought the soundtrack (which is worth buying by the way) and also the short story.So when finally getting to see the movie there was always a chance of being bitterly let down.Fortunately I was very wrong, the book at just over 50 pages is a very quick read but yet has been translated into a movie of over 2 hours. It turned out to be over 2 hours of pure joy! Not only do you have a cast of brilliant actors but you also have a movie that is visually stunning.

1255,paulmarshall611,In summary.,7,22 May 2006,"Like many people I wanted to see Brokeback Mountain to make my own opinion about a film that seems to have gathered much thought in the run up to its release. The backdrop to the film was simply stunning, and in my opinion, one of the highlights. The storyline was again, in my opinion only, weak. I do feel it has been greeted with such warmth and controversy due to a general thirst; we seldom get to see films that are ""obviously"" set to a gay theme.In hindsight a tad to long, very beautiful and at times moving. The guy behind me was in floods of tears, though I think that was more about him than the film. Now Beeches. Now that made me cry. Or Torch Song Trilogy or even Ben Hur. (Yes that did have a gay theme, but like most you have to watch for it) So maybe Brokeback Mountain was not so cutting edge after all. In summary. Not worth the hype it has been given but a great film regardless",Brokeback Mountain

It is really unfortunate that this movie isn't playing in more theaters so that more people would have access to seeing it. Surely it will simply be a run away with the awards this year. Can hardly wait to see Heath Ledger receive his aware for the awesome role he played. First time seeing Michelle Williams and she was a knock out in her role...as was Jack. So, not only do you go to see the movie and become totally transfixed, as the entire theater seemed to be, but then you go away and it haunts you for days.

Their comments all have in common that the so-called liberal and leftist agenda loves this movie and that the relationship in the film just would never have happened. I think these people need to open their windows and look out on the real world, how people really live, and not believe that gay relationships do not happen, and that the vast majority of people have no problem with it. It's also telling that it took a non-American director to make this American cowboy film. I hope this movie will be a massive global success and wins lots of Oscars. As mush as the detractors of this film dislike it, they know most people across the world will love it and will see it in huge numbers.

I wasn't actually too excited to see it, but I'd heard it was good, so a bunch of friends and I went to a matinée. This film has raw power. It's been a very long time since I've seen acting performances like the ones given by these fine actors (lead and supporting alike). Utterly believable, honest portrayals of young men struggling with their own feelings and societal bigotry, and the pain and suffering caused by not living authentically. Ledger deserves the Oscar. Loneliness, passion, loss and final enlightenment are examined in thrilling, aching detail. Gorgeous cinematography and a lovely score contribute to the beauty of the film. In the final analysis, the tag-line of this movie rings true. Love is a force of nature, and it can not be denied. Do yourself a favor and see this unforgettable movie. It's an instant classic.",Brokeback Mountain
1259,t-kingsley,A rare lily pad floating upon the stagnant pond of Hollywood,9,16 January 2006,"I was amazed that this film ever got made: I say that not only because the ""short story"" upon which it is based IS short (you could say that had it been written on the back of a cigarette packet, there would still be space), but because the subject matter (a ""gay"" film) is not exactly Hollywood's forte. Yet what has emerged from the tightly-sprung story, with its intricate detail, is a beautifully-shot, languid film stretching to 134 minutes. The dialogue is sparse (you get so used to this that when the 'talky' scenes appear they almost give you a headache) the action even more so, and yet I sensed that the film had been cut to 134 minutes as there were some odd scene jumps. Certainly there were no cuts in the ""love scenes"" (the first one was as sudden and as violent as it was in the story) and both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are not afraid to kiss each other (although not as convincingly as James Wilby and Rupert Graves in ""Maurice""). It was a strange experience to sit through a film, in a full mixed auditorium, where you could hear the proverbial pin drop: no homophobic outburst, no groans, no yawns, nothing. Everyone goes on about how certain Heath Ledger (""Ennis Del Mar"") is to win the Oscar for Best Actor, which is a pity because I think Jake Gyllenhaal (""Jack Twist"") is just as good, if not better. Okay, so both characters are tortured, angst-ridden souls, but Jack's ""Jake"" is the more complex of the two and certainly convinced me that his love for Ennis extended beyond the occasional ""high altitude f***"". That said, Heath certainly had me believing (during the ""shirt discovery"" scene) that his emptiness at losing Jake was total. This film is certainly a rare lily pad floating upon the stagnant pond of Hollywood and I can't wait for it to come out (preferably in a ""director's cut"") on DVD.",Brokeback Mountain
1260,bt1271,this movie doesn't leave your mind.,10,19 January 2006,"first of all, I'm gay and originally from the west ( arizona). the two actors esp heath really tunes in on the mentally of the rural western male. do not show emotion or let others know about you. it reminded me of my first boyfriends father and brother. all 4 actors were amazing. the soundtrack was amazing. I'm going to comment on a few of the countrys opinions and questions on the film. 1. how did jake die.-the tire iron, if you read the short story or see the trailer. he was definitely killed by the 3 men. in the trailer there's a scene that shows a mechanics face and a guy behind him with a tire iron. it was cut out of the film. and the 3 killers names are in the credits as ""killer mechanic' ""grease monkey"" and ""assailant"" 2. the sex scenes- this is mild compared to what we gay folks have had to watch on the screen in str8 films for YEARS!!!. 3. ""its too slow""- if you want to see an action film - go to King Kong!!! 4. ""they cheat on their wives""-its the 60s and 70s, being gay meant you either were killed or had to move to NYC-and these guys had no money or skills to move to a big city. 5.its sickening!-then don't go see it, go see something really dumb like a jet li or van diesal film. in summary its a wonderful film that shows how homophobia ruins the lives of those str8 and gay, how it can prevent people from being together and telling the truth about themselves before its too late. 5.",Brokeback Mountain
1261,dleyva,Tragedy in true Shakespearean meaning of word.,10,14 January 2006,"I sat it on opening day at 5 p.m. right after work and walked out of the theater numb. The entire cast is brilliant. Heath Ledger has created a character that the pain he is living is unbearable to watch. On the other hand Phillip Seymour-Hoffman the other actor being touted for an Oscar does an incredible job but does not create a character just imitates. The film is a love story for all ages to come and any human caring and compassionate person can understand regardless their their sexual orientation. Come Oscar season I will be voting for it in every category. Finally to just label it the ""gay cowboy movie"" is a disservice the director Ang Lee.",Brokeback Mountain
1262,scoo_you,Over-rated and degrading,5,13 January 2006,"I saw this film today, and based on the reviews I read, was very disappointed, but Ang Lee is an excellent director, so I was hoping the film would at least be emotionally moving and artistic.Spoilers**** Okay, first of all, I almost walked out and asked for my money back when Jack Twist practically raped Ennis in the tent. The anal sex scene seemed more like rape to me than any kind of emotional bonding experience. I find it amusing that this story is billed as a great ""love"" story when as Gene Shalit said, Jack did act very much as a sexual predator towards Ennis. Jack's aggression towards Ennis was not portrayed as a meeting of emotions and minds, but very much in the way that an adult sexual predator would stalk an innocent child. Fist fighting scenes ensued when Jack again tried to force himself on Ennis -- I found it rather degrading, to be honest.Also, I found their behavior VERY dishonorable in the way that they callously used and abused the women in their lives. They stayed with their wives and girlfriends -- lying to them the whole time they were taking ""fishing"" trips up in the mountains. They showed NO honor towards the women and children who TRULY loved them. Women are the enemy, I guess.I wouldn't bill this as a ""love story"", but as a lust story. If Jack was SO IN LOVE with Ennis, then why did he run off to Mexico and sleep with male hookers? It seems that he was bored out on the range and just looking for a cute guy to have sex with and Ennis let him have his way with him?I went to this movie with an open mind, really wanting to like it. However, this is nothing even remotely romantic about it. I found the romance between Alma and Ennis to be the most romantic relationship in the film, and that was built on deceit.I truly felt embarrassed walking out of the theater -- I felt sleazy and dirty, like I needed to take a hot shower. And this post is from a woman who has nothing against sex in cinema, if it is well done. I even prefer R and NC-17 rated movies. Heck, I've even watched gay porn clips. But this movie presented sex in a very emotionally degrading way. Like Tina Turner says, what's love got to do with it? What drew them together? What made them care about each other? Apparently only sexual lust and loneliness. I am really shocked that this movie is billed as some kind of great and noble ""love"" story. And personally, I found the lying, deceitful, and uncaring attitude of the two gay men towards the women in the film to be reprehensible. The prevailing attitude seems to be we don't care who we hurt, we just want to be free to have unbridled sex together.Jack was portrayed merely as a vapid, lying, blue-eyed, buff, pretty playboy. I have to say though that Heath Ledger's performance rocked. The performance of Heath and Michelle Williams were the best things about the film -- that and the panoramic views. It bothered me that Ennis was trying to do the right thing and break off the relationship and stand by his wife, and Jack was a weasel and kept trying to draw him back in again. And this is noble love? What about commitment to your family? What about marriage vows? If they were truly honorable, they would have been honest with the women in their lives rather than lying and deceiving them about fake ""fishing trips."" Better yet, they never would have gotten married and fathered children in the first place.Sorry folks, but TRUE love thinks about others, not just themselves. And I would find similar behavior between two married heterosexuals to be sordid as well.Some people have a funny idea about ""love"", I guess.",Brokeback Mountain
1263,robertdraper,"A perfect, sad, painful film.",10,14 January 2006,"A perfect, sad, painful film. I thought I was hard boiled when it came to movies but I had tears in my eyes at the end. Heath Ledger played his role to perfection....a shy, introverted, sad and lonely man who is fighting his emotions. The relationship between Jack and Ennis is handled with compassion and the love between them shines through. Ennis's wife Alma also has some sublime moments, without spoiling the story there is one moment when the audience all gasped and groaned in unison. The film is not without humour - the little touches balance the tension and acute sadness between the main protagonists. One of the best films we have seen in ages - also no saccharine ending. Can anyone explain to American film producers we don't always need to have perfect resolution for every movie?",Brokeback Mountain
1264,TheVeep,It's the way men bond with each other,10,16 January 2006,"A few years ago, one of my daughters was accused of liking women rather than men. It seemed like everywhere we went, people would ask us it was true. Of course we denied it every time, but that didn't stop people from asking.I guess that's why I get so angry when I hear Brokeback Mountain described as a homosexual cowboy movie. It's nothing of the sort. It's just a simple story about a very close relationship between two very manly men.I understand how people who haven't spent a lot of time around manly men might be confused. The naked grappling, kisses, and love-sodden glances may appear rather unbiblical to those who haven't experienced the kind of male bonding that occurs between cowboys, firemen, barbers and others who work in traditionally male occupations. But naked, Spartan-style wrestling is simply one of the ways men express comradeship with each other--it's like passing gas or punching a shoulder--any spelunking a Spartan-style wrestler's little soldier might do is purely accidental.Men become very close when they spend time together camping out. This movie depicts that closeness better than anything other movie I've seen. It's like I told to my wife as we were exiting the theater, ""You've always wanted to know what my hunting trips were like. Well, you just saw it."" Take your wife to see Brokeback Mountain. It'll explain a lot of things to her.",Brokeback Mountain
1265,LucyBenedetti,Feelings and Makeup.,9,21 October 2018,"Heath and Jake were well cast together in this film, a possible couple. This coupling was a good match for more recent times but a slightly too youthful one for the time period it was set in. The actors should have been a made up to be a slightly bit older as they acted the characters out as older men.You feel for them, the whole they want to be together but can't really pulls on the feels because this is a couple of men which had rawness to the feelings because we have been numbed/used to the whole male and female couples in same situations. It is now expected and/or the audience is used to it.Lastly, the scene with the daughter reunion. Heath's makeup for this part needed to be much older. It was too subtle, for Heath's character to match the age of the daughter he needs simple to age him more. Heath's final age at the end didn't show him to be old as he should've been.",Brokeback Mountain
1266,Jellybrother,"Speech is silver, but silence is golden.",10,8 March 2006,"I haven't written a review for a movie in years and, frankly, never really had the urge to write one. Especially not one for a movie as hyped as Brokeback Mountain. You know, one should think everything would be said and done and there's nothing you could add.Well, I don't know if I can add anything constructive, but this time I honestly feel the urge to, if nothing else, praise Lee, Ledger and all the cast and crew involved for bringing such a profoundly, and devastatingly, beautiful picture to the big screen.Basically you could say Brokeback Mountain tells a love story that has been lived by a thousand men (and women), but hasn't been told before. Of course this isn't all true. BBM isn't the first picture about gay men in a homophobic setting. There have been ""Head On"", ""Ma Vie en Rose"", ""Beautiful Thing"". Heck, Ang Lee himself already directed ""The Wedding Banquet"", which shared several of BBM's basic traits only in a much (much, much) more lighthearted POV.Still there's something different, unique to this picture. This isn't ""Queer As Folks"". These two guys aren't intellectuals, extroverted hall stands or omnipotent sex gods. They're plain and simple men, raised to work, raised to marry and have children. They're the kind of guy you could meet anywhere. You most likely wouldn't even notice them.And just like them, their relationship lacks any glitter and glamour. It's no wonder they never said ""I love you"". They never had any words for this emotion. But you can feel it all through the movie. From Ennis' breakdown after their first parting to the moment Jack embraces Ennis at their final one.It doesn't concentrate only on their love story though. BBM triumphs by showing all aspects that are entangled. How they try to live a normal life by marrying, ultimately living a lie and not only destroying their own happiness but those of their spouses as well. The story doesn't shy away from heavy issues but handles them without any of the melodrama one knows from too many Hollywood productions.All this wouldn't have been possible if it wasn't for the excellent cast. I had an extremely hard time understanding the dialogues with all this Texan slang or whatever it was. I guess I understood only 1/4 of what they were talking about. Yet still I came to understand they're emotions, ambitions and motivations. Basically the movie could have been wordless for most parts, it still would have had the same impact on me.The bottom line is BBM isn't just one of the most realistic depictions of a gay relationship I have ever seen, it's possibly one of the finest, strongest human dramas ever made, full with nuances.And to all those who found it oh-so surprising that they ""suddenly"" make out with each other - watch again and a bit closer this time. Just because nobody said it's there, doesn't mean it isn't.",Brokeback Mountain
1267,artmo,One not to be missed,9,18 January 2006,"The movie has opened in the UK this week. Ang Lee has given us a masterpiece. Great performances from Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Ledger should get a nomination for best actor at the Oscars and Gyllenaal for supporting actor. A best actress nomination is also on the cards for Michelle Williams.It's a gentle story of relationships. We see the two male characters fall in love, then find girls and get married, have families and eventually meet up again many years later. Beautifully filmed against the stunning backdrop of Wyoming. A sensitive subject expertly handled by Lee who gives us a surprising ending that makes the movie unforgettable. One not to be missed.",Brokeback Mountain
1268,johnbronston,Lovely film but not brilliant,8,29 January 2006,"Yes this is a very good movie with some really strong performances. As is generally the case with Ang Lee's work, this movie feels incredibly lived in. You never have the feeling that you are watching actors moving around sets from shot to shot. There is a real sense of authenticity about this movie. The performances from top to bottom are very strong. There has been an incredible amount of press on Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams and though they both do fine, detailed work in this film I wasn't blown away by either of them. To suggest that Heath's performance ranks up there with the best of Marlon Brando (as the New York Times did) is ridiculous. Yes, his performance is very vividly physically etched, but the seams still show. I see the actor making decisions in many of the early scenes instead of the character. As the film goes along that became less of an issue but the flaw still remains. However, Jake Gyllenhall and Anne Hathaway have been under-praised for their work in this movie. They are showing great range and are doing work that American film actors are supposedly incapable of: i.e. giving incredibly detailed performances through vocal inflections and line readings as opposed to physicalizing everything. American film critics are trained to look for the things that generally make American actors interesting so perhaps that explains the critical imbalance on this film. However, the film's final third swings implausibly into melodrama. I sat there thinking instead of feeling throughout that portion of the film and it marred my enjoyment of the rest of the movie. Also, the entire film might have been stronger had it been set twenty years earlier. In the last third when it is the late seventies and early eighties I kept wanting to scream at the characters to move to New York or San Francisco and enjoy the sexual revolution that is passing you by! As a queer person from the mid-west, I know that things are still difficult in those kinds of places but that is what greyhound is for. Ennis (Heath's character) might not have been able to start again but Jack certainly could have and should have. He would have found a great deal more solace on the coasts than in Mexico. Also, the first act of the film takes entirely too long to get going. No one going into the film could be unaware that the two male leads are going to get together and the film gets swept away in it's own visual poetry and establishing of their ranching habits. Ten minutes could be cut from that sequence with no adverse effects. These flaws keep this film from being a perfect work of art but they don't diminish its importance. As a mainstream gay romance, it is likely to be an eye opener for many people, and it is courageous in its depiction of the physical nature of the two lead's attraction. It is a lovely film overall but it definitely falls below a film like The Ice Storm in the cannon of Ang Lee's work for me.",Brokeback Mountain
1269,eggbaby,Defies Credibility,4,20 January 2006,"I can only give this 4/10, such is the disappointment with the build-up to this much-praised movie. I thought both main characters were painfully superficial, and the scenarios hoping to portray their love for one another (as well as the threats to their union) spanned from the implausible at best, to the Disneyesque at worst. The interplay of emotion among all the characters I thought unrealistic, especially between Ennis and his long-suffering wife; Randy Quaid as the boss-man both spies the guys in a bit of innocent horseplay and concludes instantly that the two are lovers (I almost walked out after this scene, the plot's credibility destroyed). The scenery of Wyoming is the most beautiful part of the flick, but I could have waited for that and the whole movie to come out on DVD. That, or re-watched ""Same Time, Next Year"" with Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn, which is the same movie except the exchange for gay cowboys. Another thing about this movie which was annoying was its trite, badly-written ending. The movie spans from 1963 to the early 1980's, so towards the end, when Ennis hugs Jack for what turns out to be the last time, Ennis' hand has what looks like Kaposi Sarcoma sores, and I'd bet that at least half the audience, like me, expected him to turn out to have AIDS (he didn't). By the end I was thinking, this looks more like a propagandist open-letter to the people of Wyoming, where Matthew Shepard was tortured to death. Can the minds of rednecks there be changed by showing how manly-man Ennis, at a July 4th picnic, can beat the crap out of two burly 250-pound cowboys in 3 seconds flat, then meet up with Jack and fall into each others' tender-loving arms? I sincerely doubt that the rustic folk of Wyoming, or any other such conservative-minded place, would be so easily swayed, especially when the story itself is presented so shoddily.",Brokeback Mountain

Aside from a lesbian couple and myself, there were no other Gay people there, so, I braced myself for the reaction thinking it would be negative--it was not !! The married men and women, of many different ages, were all crying their eyes out and clearly moved by what they just saw. Later, I overheard their comments--""wonderfully made"" ""very moving"" and "" heartbreaking' Clearly, the film had struck the right chord ! If the film does manage to illicit such compassion and understanding from a this crowd, it has done its job! It does not need to win awards or be singled out, it speaks for itself. Every aspect of the film works--the silences, the visuals, the performances, and the direction are all restrained, it was not preaching, just presenting to the audience the tale of these two cowboys and all those around them. The audience left the theater in tears of sadness, I left with tears of joy knowing how important the film had already become.

That said however I think Heath and Jake still did a pretty good job of the film, the scenery was brilliant...I just think the story needed to be pushed a bit more and that the audience should've seen possibly a bit more about the characters without them telling you... you certainly had to listen to what they said a lot more!",Brokeback Mountain

1273,wggmff,Stunning success but not masterwork,8,25 January 2006,"To be fair this movie is in year 2005's top 3 best movies. Two groups of people condemned this movie: one group is the people who cannot accept gay or gay movies. I am not American but from this movie I find surprisingly that in US so many people cannot accept homosexual  even they themselves are not homosexual they cannot accept other people doing that. Is American so conservative? By the way this pithy movie does not have many overheated homosexual plots, I saw some homosexual movies from Europe and Asia, compare with them Brokeback Mountain just like a CUT edition.The other group is people who don't like art movies, they watch movie just for kill time: buy a box of popcorn, sit there for 90 minutes, don't need to use head, just watching something fighting or funny or stupid I heard some people said this movie is too slow, you know why? Because they are use to watch garbage movies, so when they step into the theater their brains just stop operating immediately, no wonder they will feel the movie is slow! Brokeback mountain's success is Ang Lee's success, 'Hulk' gave him a bash and made his Hollywood route almost end, but brokeback mountain is a victorious bid, Ang Lee's triumphant comeback brought him more respects and more honors.Brokeback mountain is an excellent movie but is not an outstanding movie, it inherits Ang Lee's own style form Hsi Yen (1993) and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), you can see Ang Lee's most movies normally combine art elements and commercial elements very well, they are sensitive, full of nuance, dainty, smooth and often haunt you by their spirits. But simultaneously, I often feel Ang Lee's movie cannot be called as 'masterpiece'. Compare with my favor directors such as David Lean, Stanley Kubrick, Seigo Leone, and some movies of Steven Spielberg, Ang Lee seems still lack of something. I don't know what is it, but maybe eastern pedigree is Ang Lee's advantage, also it will be Ang Lee's weak point.",Brokeback Mountain

It was really sweet to see how excited they got when they saw each other again. This movie didn't change my opinion about homosexuality, I've been accepting of it for as long as I can remember.

Not only have I not stopped thinking about the film but I would have to judge my friends and family by how they view the film. It is impossible to walk away from this film without a different perspective on live, love and nature in all its beauty. The two leads are played to perfection and provide beautiful eye-candy for girls and guys alike. Seeing this film was a moving and life-enriching experience of Shawshankian proportions.

CRASH was USED and used only. It was the ""safe"" choice. I'm sorry Hollywood, but if you want to run away from the movies that actually make money(and yes Brokeback did and like Stealth and The Island sure as hell didn't) then keep your head in the sand and don't have these gaudy award shows to show how ""progressive"" you are and really end up cow towing to people who never go to movies anyway.

I have had many friends over the years who struggled with accepting who they are and have seen it destroy wonderful human beings. Our culture stigmatizes people in a heartless way with no conscience. Self righteous people insist that sexuality is a choice...but who would choose to be treated the way homosexuals are treated in our society. I had to talk to my son and explain the difference to him because he thought that gay and pedophile were the same thing. Only when we stop judging and hurting others will we have evolved into a truly healthy culture. What two consenting adults do in privacy is really no one else's business. I loved this movie, because it showed the reality of how a person can hate what they are. I expected Ennis to eat a gun at any moment, because he was so tortured. His wife was so hurt, and didn't understand his needs...Everyone in the movie was hurt by our society's refusal to see that this is not a choice, any more than it is my choice to be straight.",Brokeback Mountain

Now we get Transamerica and Brokeback Mountain.First off, the film was well-constructed and the acting was great, especially from Jake (Heth was kind of terrible IMO). I am tired of ""art"" films forcing their agendas down our throats, though. The indy film crowd thinks they're onto something new and profound in recent years, but these type of statements were made waaaaaaaay back in the sixties and seventies and are simply nothing new to behold. So this is an unconventional love story. WOW. I think myriads of people will change their minds of gay marriage now because of this film.So will there be a film about polygamy next year? What about incestual marriage. After all, you can't confine love, right? I want to see a film about a fourteen year old boy who marries his forty year old aunt. That will be a great ""love story.""

It remind us that perhaps any religion we practice, for all of us there is just one simple rule and is about "" Common sense"", there is nothing more simple than do not the others what you consider you wont like the others do to you. Love and you will be love, accept others no matter what and others will accept you no matter how imperfect you can be. I live in Houston, amazingly a super conservative City.

1281,annabanana973,the movie is missing many things,7,1 January 2010,"I just finished watching Brokeback Mountain. I really enjoyed the film and felt for the characters. However, I found some problems throughout the film that I would like to point out. First off, they jump into this raunchy sex scene for no reason. When the movie starts, both of the characters are in the wilderness and don't even seem to really like each other. There is no flirting whatsoever. Even if the writer intended to keep their love for each other a secret, after the secret is told they still continue to not display any actions that express their love for one another. It's just strange how the movie jumps from two men just having to work together to a surprise sex session in the tent. There was only, perhaps, three scenes of actual flirting, when they were wrestling, when Ennis put his arm around Jack, and towards the end right before Jack is hurt by Ennis not running away with him. However, they just end up talking like two friends most of the movie, just not enough holding each other, kissing, or staring at each other. And Ennis is impossible to understand, he just mumbles everything.Another problem I had with the film was when Jack visits Ennis. Filled with joy, Ennis grabs Jack and pushes him up against the wall making someone watching this movie believe Ennis is grabbing Jack to push him away from the house to share a passionate kiss. But, the push just ends up putting Ennis and Jack in front of his porch for Ennis' wife to catch them kiss. I feel this part sort of tricked viewers and was just too soon for his wife to find out. I'm surprised in the end that the parents didn't realize that Ennis was Jack's gay lover. But, maybe they did, I'm not really sure. I felt that it wasn't made clear what happened to Jack, did he die from a beating because someone found out he was gay or because of the accident Jack's wife describes? Was that just a painful thought Ennis had about Jack's demise? Despite many problems with the film, I still did enjoy it overall. There were just a few problems with it, but I think the cinematography was spectacular and the talented two actors saved the movie.",Brokeback Mountain
1282,TheGatekeeper,Pretentious and Over-hyped,3,6 February 2006,"I know my opinion is going to be grossly unpopular, but I feel the need to express it in order to round out the (IMO) undeserved showers of praise this film has received.I read the short story about a week before I saw the movie, and was hardly impressed. In fact, I was rather insulted by it. The only reason I saw the film at all was because a friend offered to pay for my ticket. As we walked out of the theatre, I felt so guilty about her paying for me to see a movie which angered me that I insisted on reimbursing her for the admission and my drink.I hated it. I really did. It was as if the most patronizing, badly-written, mind-numbingly worst piece of slash fiction jumped onto the screen and demanded to be worshipped. The only reason it's getting three stars from me was the soundtrack.For one thing, it seemed Heath Ledger had no clue what a believable Midwesterner was supposed to sound like, and decided mumbling through the script was the only way to make it passable. His wooden, washed-out demeanor gave the entire film a mega-dose of Novocaine, which for me defeated the purpose of being powerful and heart-wrenching. How am I supposed to feel sorry for anybody when the characters on the screen don't seem to feel anything themselves? The story itself was an insult to the very point it was trying so hard to get across. It's supposed to be about two men who fall into forbidden love with each other while on a sheep-herding job out in the middle of No Man's Land, Wyoming. Deciding that they can't make it work because homophobia won't let them, they part ways and marry women, all the while carrying on a twenty-year love affair behind their spouse's backs. The viewer is expected to pity these characters for loving someone they can't have, and for making destructive decisions because our homophobic society pressures them into it.THIS is what insults me. That gays are all poor, defenseless bags of depression who can't love the people they do openly because doing so just isn't convenient.Yes, violence against gays happens. It happened then and it still occurs today. But not on a scale such that it was impossible for two men to make a life out in the middle of nowhere. The threat of violence was there, yes. And it's a threat that many gay couples who actually are in love faced every day, because they viewed their bond as more important than their own safety. They were willing to sacrifice literally everything to be with each other.Had Jack and Ennis opted for this decision instead of making their ultimately stupid decisions I would've respected them. Instead, Ennis declined the offer because safety and convenience were worth more to him than Jack.To is credit, though, Ennis had the excuse of not being exactly secure in his sexuality, and he'd been engaged to Alma before he ever met Jack. But there was nothing to excuse Jack marrying a woman he didn't love to please parents who didn't love him. Society may have expected it, but it was ultimately Jack's choice to abandon his spine and give in to social pressure. I honestly would have respected him much more if he'd remained a bachelor and hooked up with another man.What angered me the most was that Jack and Ennis, however spineless and selfish they were, could do no wrong because they were supposedly in love. Instead of being brave enough to face the consequences being themselves and pursuing their love in a very unfriendly world, they hid behind their wedding rings and empty marriage vows, and in the end hurt not only themselves, but their spouses and children.I've seen so many people cry ""BUT THAT'S THE POINT! THEY HAD NO CHOICE! HOMOPHOBIA MADE THEM DO IT!,"" and for the life of me I feel like I'm the only one who sees that in fact, they DID have a choice, they just chose the physically safer, yet emotionally destructive one.In short, I can't feel sorry for people who, when faced with what is right and what is easy, choose the latter no matter selfish and foolhardy it is. Homophobia is wrong and disgusting, but even as a lesbian, I find it downright insulting to use it as a get-out-of-jail-free card when you make a bad choice.If there's anyone in the story that I do feel sorry for, it's the wives of Jack and Ennis. They truly believed their husbands loved them with all their hearts, only to find out they'd been lied to and cheated on for 20+ years. THAT'S the real tragedy.",Brokeback Mountain

I realize that it was some sort of groundbreaking movie....but it would have been better had there not been and extra 20-30 min. When you start to look around the theater at other people thats when you really know the movie is boring. I recommend seeing it because the concept is very moving, but it does get very boring. Ang Lee does create boring movies. I'm almost certain. Heath Ledger has an amazing character as well as Michelle Williams. I do admit it was one of the best screenplays I have seen this year. Just not a good entertainment quality. See it because because it is a movie that all ages and races should see because of the content and the subject matter.",Brokeback Mountain

It is beautifully, written, directed, shot, and features incredible performances from the entire cast. What strikes me most about the film is it's consistent subtlety. The film is so understated that it makes it so much more moving and all to real to experience. I have almost never been this emotionally moved by a movie. This is truly an incredibly powerful and unimaginably beautiful film.",Brokeback Mountain

However, what followed for the next two hours was incredible, the movie was extremely powerful and could lead even the most dimwitted person into a serious post-movie discussion. Just for the record, there are a few graphic gay scenes but nothing to really be grossed out by at all. And oh yeah, we had a lot of problems recruiting more 'men' to come see with movie with us so my message to all of you macho and conservative men, you aren't a man if you cant sit through this movie, and thats gods honest truth...",Brokeback Mountain

The gender constellation of the two main characters does not matter - the universal message transcends the fact that there are two men. The way in which the two main characters are tormented and their lives remain empty without each other can be compared to L'Amant by Marguerite Duras, screened as a film by J. J. Anaud in 1992.",Brokeback Mountain

Not just choked up, and not like I felt like I might cry and resisted; there was no resisting about this one. That's enough for me right there to put it in my top ten all time films as far as personal effect. When you add in amazing spare storytelling and editing, amazing sparse shooting, fascinating lighting and production, nuanced acting, and incredible music, or rather an incredible all around matching of editing, production, and score, with overall social impact and an important and timely message...you have a classic; Oscar or no Oscar. That is why the few flaws tend to fade in my mind...and why any flaws tend to seem insignificant, and mentioning them churlish, in the face of such impact...and why they have so little to do with my rating. This one was all about heart.",Brokeback Mountain
1288,HolidayGolightly,This movie will haunt me for a long time,10,23 March 2006,"For me, this cinema experience was in a realm of it's own.In it's subtle simplicities was it's magic. It washed over me like the tide, and left me speechless in it's wake. And I was not alone- the entire cinema sat still, motionless as the credits were rolling. With every tiny detail, carefully and skillfully constructed by Ang Lee, his vision for this story not so much sprung to life, but burrowed deep into your reality. An intense feeling of longing and eventually heart wrenching despair builds, but still, a sense of simple beauty remains.The reality that these two star crossed lovers are men becomes irrelevant. Such a simple and real story of regret touches everyone. The feeling that you are afraid of who you are.I think that Ennis and Jack will be with me for a long, long time.",Brokeback Mountain
1289,till-kleinert,Masterpiece,10,13 March 2006,"Kudos to Ang Lee and everyone involved in the making of this incredible work of art. Its impact, though slow-burning, hit me with full force and broke me literally to pieces when it came full circle. Ennis del Mar and Jack Twist stayed with me for days after watching the movie, as if being persons I actually knew. Sounds esoteric, but everyone who ever made friends with movie characters as a kid (i.e. with a certain turtle-necked extraterrestrial) knows what I'm talking about. Well, I guess that comparison doesn't really hold, but you know... it's just awesome to have a film do that to me again after a long time of grown-up resistance against the blurring of the borders between art and real life.In short: This is movie-making at its purest and finest, slow-paced, but highly resonant in each single frame, with a story not driven by incident, forced melodrama and the writer's apparent wish to make everything fit in a profound statement (hello there, 'Crash'), but simply by characters stuck in themselves and their own existence, with every throwback in their constant pursuit of happiness being a result not only of society's shortcomings (in an intense flashback the film reveals a shocking glimpse of the outcome of a hate crime) but of their own inability to really accept the nature of their desire. Depressing stuff this might be, but the director's humanist approach to it, with it's loving gaze on all his characters, makes it not only bearable, but a truly cathartic experience for the viewer.As you may have already noticed I would recommend you badly to see this film - it truly deserves any audience it gets, and it might even change a few minds, let alone lives, along the way... as it is, in case you hadn't known, a love story between two men, transcending the queer movie as well as the Hollywood romance.Not to be missed, 11 out of 10",Brokeback Mountain

Ang Lee just try and succeed at breaking our hearts and prejudices because in the beginning is a little uncomfortable but while the movie is developing you start feeling all that emotional charge and by the end you can't stop felling dawn. so I congratulate all the people involve in the movie, especially Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger for a wonderful heart felted performance for making us believe the premise that loves comes in different shapes and gets to us in mysteriously wonderful ways and we just have to make the most of it, or we could loose the chance for happiness.",Brokeback Mountain
1292,LSSchwartz-1,Touching movie.,10,2 March 2006,"I just saw ""Brokeback Mountain"" and I thought it was just so true in it's acting. The four of them (Heath, Jake, Michelle and Anne) were real sincere and pure in their acting and it touched me. I'm not being dramatic here, it just really touched me that such young actors could have performed in such a way. The movie was really well done, Ang Lee exceeds in his directing, as he usually does, actually. In no moment was the subject taken lightly or in a way that could be offensive to the audience, be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a true love story as I haven't seen a long time, and not only between the cowboys, but also, the devotion of their wives, even if things don't work out too well. At only a few moments did I think it was long a movie, but it drags in moments you can't really NOT drag the movie, so it's understandable. I must admit that a couple of scenes made me uncomfortable, but not in the way most people would feel uncomfortable about, but 'cus I was looking beyond the scene, and seeing the actors (blame Oprah and the interview I saw with them), and how serious and professional you have to be to do those scenes. When you see the characters of Jack ""Nasty"" Twist and Ennis, then you just see what I was saying above, true love. I also loved the fact they're guys, normal guys, and how they treat their relationship not as a gay one, but of two people in love, at least I see that in Ennis, even though all through the movie I get the impression Jack has always known his sexual preferences, and Ennis is sort of dragged into him, for who he is, not for his gender.",Brokeback Mountain
1293,Brock-47,Very Strong -- Definitely Worth Seeing,10,2 March 2006,"I find it interesting reading the comments regarding this film after having seen it for myself. I can see some people thinking it was more moving or intense than other people, but these ratings of zero or one star with little relevant commentary on the actual content of the film make me think that many of the people posting these low ratings are posting here after never having even seen the film. That is really a cheap shot to come on to a movie site and make negative comments after never even watching a film! Unfortunate to be honest.....Regarding the film itself, I found it to be very unique in its subject matter. The underlying story is very strong, the acting is very credible and very good, the camera work and scenery captured is excellent and the directing is really strong. At first I was going to say that the feelings of the two main characters towards each other was not well enough explained or developed, but after thinking about it I don't think such feelings really can be truly explained in any movie. The looks, glances, expressions and the few words show the feelings a lot more than a ton of dialog or history ever could. Note: this film gets you thinking a lot after you have seen it, at least it did with me. It is very moving in many ways.In conclusion, I was very pleasantly surprised by this film because of its force and because it does not fall into any stereotypes or predictable scenarios. It also covers a subject that is almost never covered in film. Thank you to Ang Lee and the rest of those involved in creating this film! It is one of the best films I have seen in many years. Although I have not fully come down with my final verdict for the long run, as of now I rank it up on my all-time list with The Deerhunter, The Natural and a few others. Really great.",Brokeback Mountain
1294,scoop-1972,Absolutely Overwhelming!,10,4 March 2006,"A lot has been anticipated about this movie.Hollywood hyped-up movies tend to let you down, however ""Brokeback Mountain"" totally blew me away! Don't make the assumption about what this story is about until you have seen it. Yes, it's a gay love story but there's much more to this movie's content. Betrayal, loyalty, intimacy, secrecy just to name a few. For a long long time Hollywood has concentrated on the typical ""straight"" storyline that we are so used to watching day in and day out. Ang Lee has taken this to another level and made a film with so much feeling and emotion that it puts shame to these typical films. The scenery is breath taking the acting superb.It's poignant, and delicately told. It's been a while since a film really got to me so much i had to hide my face in my hands i was crying that hard!

1295,robert-1025,Music Missteps,7,5 March 2006,"I give this film a seven (high for me) just merely for the IDEA of it as well as superb acting moments and the middle finger it extends to the narrow minds of Middle America. However, the music was a big disappointment to me. The time period covered included some amazing country music; especially in the early 70's when social commentary in country music songs by writers like Jimmy Webb, Kris Kristofferson, Tom T. Hall, etc. was the rule rather than the exception. With so many scenes set in honky tonks, the bands and jukeboxes could have featured so many gems that added authenticity and subtly colored the conceit of this film. Perhaps the biggest gaffe was having Steve Earle's ""Devil's Right Hand"" pour out of a jukebox in 1978 which is AT LEAST 10 years early for that song. The acoustic guitar cues adding atmosphere to the Brokeback Mountain scenes were nice, if not perfunctory. Also, I don't think the word Vietnam was mentioned even once. You could argue that this film was not about Vietnam and to do that would have distracted from the central issue, but to NOT mention it seems to miss an opportunity to harness the irony and anger of the era.",Brokeback Mountain

1297,miyazaki1980,In humanity we trust ...,8,28 March 2006,"Europeans may sometimes seem like the stubborn aristocrat that does not want to give in to the changes and the challenges of our times. Europeans might also seem to be quite infatuated with themselves, keeping up the appearances and sometimes even acting in a haughty way, when addressing the US and other big nations. Honestly speaking as a citizen of a tiny nation, this might indeed be more the case than we would lake to admit.To the same extent however, there does exist an important critique to this attitude. And this voice comes from the cultural arena. Concerning films, it gives the European film even a special kind of appeal to its public, in that it reflects critically about past and present, where other films prefer to defer from it.Well, If You would start wondering where Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain fits into this somewhat peculiar piece of text ... I can reply that, with Brokeback Mountain, Hollywood has shown that it can be critical, and that it can show the hidden sides too ... but most of all: that it can create a really strong feeling of identification with the US. Hailed by every newspaper, succeeding even the inquisitions of the harshest cinema commentators ... with every movie theater - even those who claim to show only European movies! - receiving the tapes with open arms. And the public? They love it! Whether straight or gay, old or young, ... the all trust in love, and the honesty with which the theme is handled. Openness. And I think that's the essence of it: Ang Lee has, rather than making a movie about gay love, succeeded in making a magnificent movie about human love, be it male love. The anthem might be: In human love we trust!",Brokeback Mountain

It starts out very explicit but after the movie starts to fall into place it becomes quite captivating.the movie starts out with a bus driving down a highway and right away your attention is drawn. The message this moving brings out changed my idea on gay people. It helped me to understand that any love is still love, and no one should be able to condemn someone for showing it.I cried for about half the movie, it really is a deep and touching story.

A love so powerful that is willing to set aside boundaries and obstacles that might come along the way. Brokeback mountain how love has not barriers, how it could be felt in so many ways and express itself without the restriction of a society, or even gender.This masterpiece will me remembers trough out time as the very first movie who made it to the academy nominations, recognitions from several state critics societies and then some. Brokeback Mountain started in only 100 screens in the US. By the en d of the first month this number in creased radically.It is a shame that people like Jack and Ennis are forced to live a double life just to fulfill society's rules. They are forced to get married, sometimes they end up having children causing the marital partner and children to suffer when the truth is reveal. Gay love could still be considered as forbidden in may areas of the country. The main attribution of this movie is to prove that love is a human emotion therefore it cannot be categorized into gay or straight.",Brokeback Mountain
1300,molijonah,Don't wait to catch this one - Best of this Century,9,26 March 2006,"This is probably the best film of the 21st Century. So why did I give it a 9 instead of the full marks? It is handsomely produced, visually striking and bars no holds when it comes to splashing human emotions across the screen. It must have been particularly hard for Annie Proulx to have her story pipped at the post on Oscar night. One cannot question her razor sharp writing that cuts like diamond through glass. Unfortunately, the script left much to be desired. There were good reasons why ""Brokeback Mountain"" lost the Best Picture Oscar.Because the Ennis character opens up to Jack and speak more words to him in one fireside chat than in a whole year, does not give enough motivation for the relationship that developed. Even if Jack had homosexual tendencies, to which the writer gives no hint, he would not have made the move in the tent unless Ennis had given him some specific physical indication, maybe a bit of horseplay or a significant touch.The director showed brilliance in the intimate scenes where he caught every nuance of their feelings that made hearts bleed. The utter loneliness of the Ennis character at the end and that poignant last line to the shirt and jacket: ""Jack, I swear..."" was as disturbing as King Lear's entrance with his dead daughter in his arms. The impossibility of overcoming the obstacles they faced and their desperate need and longing to be together make for one of the most heartbreaking tragedies I have seen in a long time. Unfortunately, there were too many scenes where they simply rode through the lush scenery together or crossed a swollen river, when what we should have seen was the development of their relationship. Why did they love each other so much? What did they give to each other, besides sex, that made their love so magnetic? Again, there was no way anyone could remember that the shirt under the jeans jacket that Ennis finds in his lover's childhood home was the shirt he missed when they came down with the sheep from the mountain. A quick flashback to Ennis wiping his bloody nose on the shirtsleeve would have been enough.Finally, what was most annoying was the insert at their last meeting of an earlier time with nothing to indicate this was a flashback. Suddenly, there was Jack, sans moustache, asleep on his feet by a fire. Ennis comes to embrace him from behind, then rides off on horseback with the words: ""See you in the morning."" Then Jack, with moustache, watches his friend drive away in his truck.So, why as much as 9? Because the acting of the protagonists and the actors in smaller roles was of the highest calibre, though the two leads should have enunciated their words more clearly. The girls were wonderful but Randy Quaid was brilliant in his two or three scenes. There is a breath-taking honesty to this film when raw emotions are brought into play that makes the film haunt you long after you've seen it. It draws you to see the film again and again and again - I have seen it four times and I still want to experience it. The director must be a man of great understanding, with a wealth of knowledge on human psychology. He hit all the right notes.And 'Jack F*ckin' Twist' got to me.Well done!",Brokeback Mountain

The first couple of weeks after I saw it, I couldn't seem to get it out of my thoughts. It really made me think about how important it is to live life to the fullest. All the actors were great, the music was great. The film is not a gay western, as many people think, it is a film about love and about life. I hope it will make people see the importance of not being too afraid to live their lives, and afraid to love because they are afraid of loosing too much. This film really shows that if you do not live out of fear of loosing everything, then you will do exactly that: Loose everything.",Brokeback Mountain
1302,villtino,Brokeback is a film not to be missed,10,14 January 2006,"Seldom has cinema in recent years produced such a striking visual film with such an emotional punch. Brokeback Mountain is such a film. The performances of Ledger and Gyllenhaal are those moments when fantasy becomes reality; so deep and moving are their portrayals. These haunting, riveting performances elicit the most intense emotion as to leave the audience stunned by their achievements. Director Ang Lee has transcended all earthly feats giving us a cinematic experience that lasts well after the last reel is played. I predict this film will take all the Oscars this year, certainly for a home run performance by Ledger as the tormented and emotionally unabled Ennis. For all those gay cowboy jokes and blatant ignorance, simply see this film to be led down a path surely as brutal yet as hauntingly lovely that this story depicts.

From the very moment the main characters are introduced to the screen, you are drawn right into the film with them.Ang Lee did a more than incredible job of bringing this short story to the big screen. It is about time that a true American love story, between two men, could be portrayed so well to the mass population. Sure movies like the Birdcage & Too Wong Foo, were good, as well as mainstream, but also played on the stereotypical idea that many people have of gay people. This movie does not play on that stereotype, but is simply an honest portrayal, that you will even forget that it is about two men loving each other, and just see that it is two human beings deeply in love.This movie plays on all of the emotions, from being happy, to down a down right tear jerker at times.I can not recommend this film highly enough, and have went to see in the theater, so far, 4 times with various friends and family.",Brokeback Mountain

I rarely get tears from any movie, but I was definitely crying at the end of this amazing film. I've learned that I should always be true to myself. Perhaps the main characters in this story should have always been true to themselves as well and lived their lives the way they had been destined, but maybe that would not have worked. Love is such a mystery and is capable of creating incredible happiness yet is also capable, and more often than not, an incredible sadness.

1306,ausman-2,Wyoming really is like that,10,17 December 2005,"I grew up in Wyoming and I have to say that those characters really are like the people there. I don't know how he did it, but Ang Lee really captured Wyoming for me. I had flashbacks to growing up in Kemmerer, Story and Sheridan in her depiction of Riverton.The real Riverton is quite a bit larger than the one in the movie, but there are plenty of little Wyoming towns just like that.The same suffocating hopelessness and poverty, the same violence, the same narrow minds but good hearts, just like in the Wyoming of my memories.I thought that the acting was outstanding and the script writing superlative. Ennis particularly did a good job acting with the few words he spoke, yet he spoke volumes with his mannerisms and his facial expressions. He is the epitome of the strong silent cowboy. He deserves and Oscar for this work.",Brokeback Mountain

The 2 leads i.e. Heath and Jake, deserved the accolades for their intensity, passion and sincere portrayal of 2 people in love. The love scenes and the scenery mountain background were just beautiful - a testimony of their unconditional love. I sympathized for both of the characters. It's hard to be gay & in love & to be married especially in our conservative yet homophobic society. The truth is the story reminds me of how pathetic my love life is. I'm a single gay man and i wish i had the love just like Ennis & Jack had.",Brokeback Mountain
1308,bret_mav,A Profoundly Melancholic Masterwork,10,3 January 2006,"At its core this film is not about sexuality it is about profound loss and about not having a true life. Not one character comes though the other end of this without loss. And why? Not easily answered. An intolerant society and a rigid masculine template jump to mind. This film is hard to characterize, though. From its opening shot to its final one, there is an overwhelming sense of isolation and loneliness. Time passes but the outside world rarely infiltrates; some songs, some hairstyles, some newer cars but never the news of the day. This remoteness makes the film and its ultimate conclusion a tragedy. If there is ever a place to live a truthful and fulfilling life it should be Brokeback Mountain, but neither Jack Twist nor especially Ennis del Mar can truly live the life they desire. As it stands, theirs is mingled life that spans years and yet still seems empty and devoid. I cannot say truthfully that the actions of these men are without criticism especially with how they affect others in their lives but nothing they do to other people compares to what they do to each other. While theirs is a timeless love, both physically and spiritually, they also are haunted with melancholy and emptiness; a troubled human conflict that will shake most loving people to their core.As a film it is remarkable. Ang Lee's direction is a masterly and will be studied. Every image, every performance and edit is delicately and masterfully maintained throughout. The performances are amazing and for some will be career defining. Ledger is revelatory and I would stand his performance alongside any of Brando's early ones. You know Ennis. You love him and are angry with him and Ledger is never false in his portrayal. Gyllenhaal is just as amazing. Jack is the yin to Ennis' yang and Jake nails him. Without his character's love for life, the final scenes would not carry as much emotionally. Jake's performance is focused in his eyes and the sparkling flame within them. Watching that flame diminish over time is heartbreaking. Michelle Williams' Alma has deservedly received accolades and she is raw and real. Just as noteworthy is Anne Hathaway and I must say she really surprised me. In what could have been a mannered and arch character, she brings Lureen startlingly to life, most notably in her phone conversation with Ennis. The photography and music are beautifully intertwined and will stir your emotions and be with you for days.That this film is subjected to trite and hateful degradations by some is saddening. It seems at conflict with the truth and compassion that these ""moral"" people aspire to. To spout vitriol about this film seems so misplaced if anyone has truthfully seen it. It is this hate, however, that hits to the core of what Ennis believes. That no matter how fundamentally real Ennis' and Jack's feelings are for one another, there will be those that hate them and being hated is a more unspeakable horror than living alone.",Brokeback Mountain
1309,cheef,Fascinating movie!,10,21 March 2006,"It is very difficult and it is really hard to write something about this movie. The first surprise for me came when I entered into a movie theater auditorium. It was ten minutes before beginning of the performance and nobody was there. However, the auditorium was full during several minutes. The age structure of the people was interesting. I expected almost young people, between 20 and 30, but it came surprisingly also older people, between 40 and 50. By the way, the movie was also rated like in the U.S.A. (age 15 and older). The typical noise was heard during the advertisements, but at a time there was deep silent. No talking or no rustling of popcorn bags or something like this. From the first minute, I was fascinated and ""absorbed"" by the movie. Wyoming is really beautiful and fascinating. I was never there and in America also, but I felt me like in my home country, because I love mountains. One can say that there were kitsch pictures, but I don't think so. The camera was wonderful and very sensitive. I am not big fan of country music, but it was very nice. I am looking forward to a soundtrack. Finally, the actors were all fantastic. However, I would like to pay a compliment to Heat Ledger as Ennis Del Mare. He surprised me. Your interpretation of Ennis Del Mare was so realistic that I believed him all what he said. Your mimic face reactions were really believable. With minimum of the words he can express every emotions that were either on the surface or very deep inside and the tried came up. It is also due to Leadger's very interesting voice with fascinating timbre. Keep it up! 10/10",Brokeback Mountain
1310,predator_112,Excellent and low key,10,9 December 2005,"I have a major problem with anyone who describes this as the ""gay cowboy"" movie. Yes, it is a cowboy movie (but not in the stereotypical sense) and it does have some elements of a gay film (two male characters falling in love). But the way it's handled by everyone involved makes Brokeback Mountain so much more than the ""gay cowboy"" movie.Everything about the film is tastefully done. Frankly, for the ""gay cowboy"" movie, we see more female breasts than anything else. And I think Brokeback is better for that. If it had been a skin fest, then the entire production would have been written off as pandering. The music is kept to a minimum to allow the actors to carry the scenes--and what a group there are. Jake and Heath, of course, but also Randy Quaid, Linda Cardellina, Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway. They all turn in fine performances that evoke different emotions-heartbreak, anger, resentment, bewilderment.It's about loneliness, rejection, hanging on, happiness and deluding yourself. It's not a fun movie or a happy one where everyone gets what they want. This is an excellent movie, most likely the best I've seen this year. Ang Lee doesn't draw attention to the directing with wild shots or fantastic camera angels; it's all very realistic and grounded.",Brokeback Mountain
1311,kandgk,sets a new standard for movie excellence,10,17 January 2006,"started off a little slow, made me think, did i really want to see this movie? there was a lot of anticipation waiting for the ""scene"". after getting past the obvious issue, the movie kept my interest throughout.acting was excellent, made you forget gay or straight, i just saw people trying to cope with life's problems. the film deals with many issues, respect,integrity, love and hate. the scenes with the young family's everyday life hit it right on, kids crying, not enough time, money and hands for the task. one unforgettable scene among many, was the wife's expression when she realizes her husband's fishing buddy is more than a friend. the scenery was excellent,expansive mountain fields filled with flocks of sheep.would be worth seeing a second time, as the movie is complex and emotional.",Brokeback Mountain
1312,wolftever,A Moving Experience,7,8 January 2006,"I will admit that I was one of those people who had serious reservations about seeing this movie. I wouldn't classify myself as homophobic by any stretch of the imagination, but I just didn't think I would be interested in seeing this grand, epic love story about two cowboys. For one thing, I don't think I would be interested in seeing ANY movie about two men in love. For another, they're COWBOYS, for Pete's sake! Cowboys aren't gay! Well, these two are actually sheepherders. So I guess at least the sheep got a break that winter.I drug myself out to a showing of the film anyway, first chance I got. For one reason and one reason only - I always see as many Oscar contenders as possible. And apparently this one is going to be quite the contender. Maybe the one to beat, ala The Aviator last year? Here's hoping Munich comes through in Million Dollar Baby's spoiler role. Hey, I'm not saying I didn't like Brokeback Mountain. I most certainly did. But I liked Munich a lot better. Just like I enjoyed Good Night, And Good Luck a lot better. And Syriana. And Crash. And several other movies this year.Ang Lee did a remarkable job with this movie. I would join the legions who are saying he made up for The Hulk with this movie. But I happened to think The Hulk was an excellent movie, and one of the best comic book adaptations I've seen yet. But the fact that Lee was able to make me care about these two guys is incredible. I seriously went into the theater expecting to have to make myself suffer through this thing. But Lee did two things that proved me wrong.First, he kept the sex scenes to a bare minimum and handled them as tastefully as possible. You get the idea of what's going on but you don't walk away with the images burned into your brain. This made the whole thing a lot easier to digest.Second, he created a cast of characters so real, so textured, so believable, so HUMAN, that you couldn't resist getting caught up in their story. Actually, the credit for this fact probably goes to the screenwriters more so than Lee. But hey, Lee brought them to life on the screen.The actors, too, went a long way toward making the movie great. Jake and Heath should both be nominated for Oscars. I know Heath is getting all the attention for his slow-burn role as Ennis. But Jake took what is basically an unsympathetic role and made Jack Twist someone we could care about. (I know Gene Shalit has said Jack Twist is a sexual predator who leads Ennis astray. I don't see it quite that way, but Shalit probably has a point to a certain degree.) The most moving part of the movie, for me, is the final confrontation between Jack and Ennis. It's a tender, touching, volatile, wrenching, heartbreaking scene.The last scene of the movie, after Ennis learns his daughter is getting married, will be burned into my consciousness forever. What a closing shot.I'm not sure this thing is Best Picture material. It's probably in my Top Ten list of films I've seen this year, but it's nowhere near Number One. Still, I'm glad I saw it. And that's pretty amazing in itself.",Brokeback Mountain
1313,chris.j.warren,My new number one favourite film of all time!,10,5 February 2006,"I saw Brokeback Mountain a week ago and I can't stop thinking about it. I had to go back this weekend for a second viewing, which revealed far more depth and an even greater appreciation. Never before have I experienced so many overlapping emotions after watching a film, nor driven by a desire to share the experience with others.Firstly I must acknowledge that Brokeback Mountain may not be to everyone's taste, especially for those who prefer popcorn-flicks that provide a thrill for a couple of hours, but are largely forgotten within a few hours of returning home. Similarly, if you have a problem with dramas, romances, or gay themes, then you are unlikely to enjoy this film. If you have strong feelings against such genres, this one will not change your mind, but neither is trying to make the point that you should.At its heart this film is an exploration of what happens when the fear of what others might think, say, or do leads a person down a path of denial: a tragedy not just for them, but also to those close to them. This film bravely takes these themes into the world of mid-western 1963. If ever there was a time and place that was considered overtly un-gay, then this is must be it. In fact, I can't think of another setting without taking something away from the effectiveness or impact of this film.While not shying away from depicting the physical reality of the central same-sex relationship, very quickly you realise that the motivation for the characters is less about sex, and more about the emotional bond they share. Regardless of your gender or sexuality, most, if not all, will relate to these characters profoundly, even if not specifically. You do not need to be a woman or gay to appreciate this story, and the film's sex scenes are kept to the minimum necessary to maintain credibility.The strength of Brokeback Mountain comes from its subtlety of script and the complete lack of melodrama or exposition, allowing the performances to shine through with such heartbreaking clarity as to transport us completely into the character's lives. Clearly, this is a film that deserves all the accolades it has been receiving, transcending any one label that may be given to it.I can't wait for this film to be released on DVD so I can add it to my collection. Brokeback Mountain is now, officially, my new number one favourite film of all time.",Brokeback Mountain
1314,rojay_99,The best movie (so far) of the decade !,10,22 January 2006,"This is not only a MUST SEE movie, but it is, in my opinion, the best movie of this decade (so far)! It is a motion picture that will change attitudes, heal wounds, bring old friends (and lovers) back together, and bring joy and restore fond memories to millions around the world. I hope that all movie lovers will take time to see it, and to record their comments, whatever they might be, on this website, and others like it, so that this motion picture will receive the wide exposure that it so richly deserves. Not everyone will appreciate this picture, and certainly some will enjoy it more than others, but it should be seen by the widest possible audience. It is a great achievement in film history, and I hope it will reach all those for whom it will truly be a great blessing !",Brokeback Mountain
1315,absolutsth79,the most powerful movie i have ever seen,10,22 February 2006,"this movie is so tragic it makes your heart ache for Ennis and jack. to see two people so in love but not able to express it because of the norms of society absolutely makes you feel it yourself.i have never seen a love story that affected me quite the way this did. it was outstanding.The acting of heath ledger was above par. he played a part that was totally out of character for the roles he usually plays. he is extremely versatile, and his on-screen chemistry with Jake gyllenhaal was perfect for the premise of the film. the only character i would have any complaints about in the film would be Anne Hathaway. she did not seem to fit into her role, and the interviews she did on TV after the movie was released was very evident of such. it was almost as though she was ashamed to be there or have been there.Michelle Williams played an Oscar winning role in my opinion as a supporting actress.",Brokeback Mountain

Hats off to everyone in making and starring in this LOVE story. Not a story of gay men.. but unforgettable love story. I felt so bad for the two main characters for they could not be with each other , maybe different times it would have been different. Excellent acting. My daughter who is fourteen watched it with me and after it was done she commented on the love story not any of the sexual contend of this movie. Everyone has been in the situation where you cannot be with the one whom you love so much, homosexual or not. One of my all time favorite movies.Can't wait to buy it .",Brokeback Mountain

The performances in the film were outstanding, especially on the part of Heath Ledger. As far as Jake Gyllenhaal goes, I actually thought he should have won the Oscar for BSA over George Clooney for Syriana, although he did an excellent job as well. I just got more involved and invested in this storyline and the characters, and, while most movies cant make me cry, I was sobbing in the theater, against my better efforts. This seem a little ranty and in-cohesive, but that is just how flabbergasted the film left me. I went in expecting a lot, and left having received more than I ever could have imagined.",Brokeback Mountain
1318,dejonghcito,"It's a good movie, but...",7,1 April 2006,"Yesterday I saw Brokeback mountain, and sure, it is a good movie, but not an extraordinary one. I don't see the fuss this movie has risen all over. Up points: The gay topic is told with respect, and quite normally. It's the common love story, but where lovers are both males. Photography is astonishing, with broad angles and breathtaking landscapes. Down points: There is some abuse of landscapes. The big fault to me lies in the time line: while Twist and Del Mar have kids, they don't look like significantly older, even after years of hard work by Mr Del Mar. Mr Twist grew a mustache, and that should be it, says Ang Lee. It's a good movie to watch, but it won't go to my favorites.",Brokeback Mountain

It touched what I never knew existed in me. The fact that it was two men made no difference to me. The acting from Heath Ledger was beyond superb and Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal gave exceptional performances as well. The cinematography was fabulous and surely not to be forgotten. The story this was adapted from was short, and I'm amazed Ang Lee could put so much emotion into it. The actors, director, and screen writers did an amazing job of molding the characters. I've seen the movie at least 10 times and have noticed a minimal number of mistakes concerning continuity. The actors really seemed to crawl inside of their characters and warped themselves, not the characters. I appreciated that, because often when you see a movie from a book, the characters are weird, and many events are changed. While some things were removed for the sake of having a viewing audience (there was some fairly graphic writing in the novella), very little was changed. That's a very nice thing to see. This is a movie for an mood, or any day. I loved it.",Brokeback Mountain

The film is undeniably one of the most touching and sensitive human portraits I have seen in a long time. The performances are transcendental, heart-wrenching, brilliant. The quiet moments in the film are the most heart-wrenching of all; the love shared between the two characters is expressed with a tenderness and tranquility that leaves viewers anguished by the reality of their situation.

1321,armytrail,A movie that will take its place among the great films in the history of cinema,10,9 April 2006,"Yesterday evening my wife and I went to our neighborhood theater to watch Brokeback. I've seen many, many films over the years. These films include some of the great movies in the history of the cinema. Brokeback can rightly take its place in the select category of the greats. Ang Lee is masterful and creative in his direction. Ledger and Gyllenhaal are as extraordinary and brilliant as a Brando, Pacino, (James) Dean, Crowe, and DeNiro. The musical score, which is haunting and majestic, intensifies and amplifies both the emotions of the actors and brilliance of the script.A film of this caliber does not come around very often and when it does, you realize that you are watching something extraordinary and magnificent. Lee, Ledger, Gyllenhaal...I swear!",Brokeback Mountain

A movie about 2 homosexual cowboys did not particularly motivate me, but given the accolades it has been receiving of late, i tried it out. Basically there is not much of a story here. If it wasn't for the fact that the cowboys were gay, there would be nothing here at all. If it had been a love story about cowboys of differing gender (a man and a woman) the movie would have been even worse. I gave it 3/10 instead of 1/10 just for the innovation of a previously unused storyline. Save your money folks, this was 2 hours i'll never get back. Personally i just don't see any reason for all the hype.",Brokeback Mountain
1323,the_yonders,Does Jack 's love strong enough ?,6,4 April 2006,This movie was good . But I just could not understand why Jack's love for Ennis( which was strong as the story tells us ) could not change Ennis even after a span of 20 ys ( that is too long).If Jack loved Ennis so much & and could do anything for him (to the extend of leaving their families & living together)why did he or his love not change the mind set of Ennis. Ennis knew all about Jack's love and still took him for granted .If Ennis had changed gradually things would have been different. I think Jack and Ennis should have talked about issues which separated them from each other for so long.......the movie revolved around physical attraction and nothing was shown/ felt regarding emotions...... Ang lee direction 8/10 .landscape and ambiance perfect 10 (esp for a love story ) but relationship between Jack and Ennis just 5/10....In any relation(esp with ur lover)U have to respect and understand that person on his /her grounds.Love and life is beautiful...u just have to let it grow.....,Brokeback Mountain

1325,mike-3373,Camera work is good but that's the only thing it has.,3,7 April 2006,"The story line is relying on shock and awe to carry this show, however there is little depth to the characters. I don't know why this has received such great reviews, other than for some strange reason if you object to the film you are dismissed as a homophobe. I simply didn't see a quality movie, the story line was shallow, and did not deserve the acclaim it received. The camera work was good, but little else was worth seeing. With the acclaim and the academy awards it's plain to see that the Hollywood crowd is much more focused on their agenda and political statements than they are on producing quality films. As a movie enthusiast, I am disappointed by this movie, but more so I am appalled by the folks that put poor movies on a pedestal simply because they portray a controversial concept that they might agree with. I suggest you wait until it is available for rent for $1and then spend you dollar on something more worthwhile than this movie.",Brokeback Mountain
1326,Kim-Simcoe,Very Good Film,9,7 April 2006,"I just watched this magnificent film and was both awed and envious of a love so pure, honest, and so meant for each other as the 2 men in this film were meant for each other. It saddens me that the characters would never get to be with one another, not totally, because of their fear of discovery from the otherwise ignorant souls of their home towns, and as a result, their stolen moments that they did have were made that much more precious. The feeling of true love that I saw in this movie is heartfelt and although neither man mentions the word ""Love"" to the other, you feel that it doesn't have to be mentioned - it's just there. It makes myself, and I'm sure, many who watched this film, yearn for a piece of what they experienced for one another, even if only for a moment. So few of us have this wonderful chance. I also felt pity for Ennis' wife, at the rejection and jealously she must have felt, and you really suffered along with her as she tried to be the good wife until she could no longer be silent. Brokeback Mountain,though a simple film throughout, had a great impact on me, and I will always enjoy it and feel compassion for the two doomed characters in the movie, and I hope to be able to read the story it was based on soon.",Brokeback Mountain
1327,dont_speak07,Excellent Movie...,10,7 April 2006,"I will admit, when I first heard of this movie, I myself referred to it as ""The Gay Cowboy Movie"" Until just recently, I was all alone on a Thursday afternoon with nothing to do, so I decided to go rent a movie. Nothing really seemed interesting. One of the clerks had recommended Brokeback, and willingly I decided to take a chance. From beginning to end, the movie was pure genius. Never in my entire life have I ever seen a script written so beautifully. This movie not only shows passion, it shows love for what it really is. By the end of the movie, I was crying hysterically. This movie touched me like no other that I've ever seen before. And what great courage it took Heath and Jake to take on the roles of a completely different lifestyle. Superb job on this guys... In my mind, I think Heath Ledger deserved the Oscar over Phillip Seymour Hoffman. 100% I saw both movies, and there was no comparison. He is now a well-respected actor in my book. Jake, you were excellent as well. Although Ennis never really showed his love for Jack through out the movie. His true self is revealed in the end. However... I have a question, I know movies are supposed to have more questions than answers, but I do have a few questions. I hope someone can help me out. What did Ennis mean at the very end of the movie? Jack, I swear... I don't understand what he meant by that. Nonetheless, that comment still made me cry like a baby. And, was Jack murdered in Mexico by a gang who didn't accept gay's? Or, did his wife have him killed? Because she seemed pretty emotionless while telling Ennis the news. Please fill in the blanks for me someone, I could use the help.

I saw it the first night it came to town and rented the video the first night it was released. Being at home watching the video allowed me to be more emotional. As a 55 year old gay male and after having a 22 year relationship starting in 1976, I can identify with every emotion and situation in the movie. Even though at the time, the relationship could not be open, most people did acknowledge us as a couple, sort of an unspoken truth. I can identify more with Jack while my partner was definitely an Ennis type. I wasn't concerned about others' opinion but he was quite cautious. This movie was a good portrayal of the time period. I absolutely loved this movie. Reminds me of Patricia Nell Warren's series of books ""The Front Runner"", Harlam's Race, Billy's Kid, Fancy Dancer and The Wild Man. These,too, should be made into movies.",Brokeback Mountain

From a technical standpoint, its pretty well done.But all the hype and glowing reviews from a mostly liberal and pro-gay media only came about because the story was about two men who had gay sex. That's it.There's nothing really remarkable about Brokeback Mountain. Its not a love story and in fact it seems to be anti-love.

My only problem with this film is that Ennis mumbles a lot and I can not understand some of the dialog. Anyone else have this problem? Is there a place I can read the dialog? Does the original short story (in the New Yorker)have the same last line as the screen play?

But It's the first time that I see a love story with no cliché. Ang Lee turned this movie into not just entertainment but into a beautiful experience. The actors, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal played so well their characters definitely had the performance of their lives. They were just pure and clean the entire movie. It's not a movie that forces you to cry but after 10 minutes you have forgotten about it. The movie makes you feel sad and depressed,,and the scenes really get stuck in your mind.

1334,hchia,Live and let live,10,24 August 2019,"The third time watching this masterpiece, and still in awe of it. I feel compelled to write a review.
I found much detail this time, helping me to have a deep understanding of this bittersweet love.When Jack made the acquaintance of Ennis, he watched Ennis through the rearview mirror. You know, not any STRAIGHT man will peep other men in this way. And Ennis leaned against the wall, took off his cowboy hat and shot him a sideways glance.
That's the beginning of love~They had a really simple life after going to Brokeback Mountain, just looking up livestock, cooking...
However, there are many lovely moments.1. Ennis got hurt and came back to the tent really late. And Jack, waiting for him for a long time, which made him totally nervous. He shouted Ennis, but after he saw his wound, he became tender. I can feel it through his blue eyes, filling of worry. He wanted to clean Ennis's wound but was refused. Maybe because Ennis knew he'll be obsessed by this freaking love.
2.There is a scene that Jack looked at Ennis at the peak. And Ennis glazed him at the bottom of the mountain.
Obviously, they're attracted by each other. Their relationship just like the dynamite.3. The first sex. They both drunk at night and slept together in the tent.
They were under pressure for a really long time!Years of the frustration and repression being boosted this time.
Maybe it was not tender but impressive.And I totally understand this feeling!
As a queer in China, the surrounding always makes me stressed. I afraid of telling the whole world my sexual orientation. I need to pretend I interested in girls at school. I should tolerate the homophobic conversation just because I afraid some of them will suspect that I'm gay......
THAT'S SUCKSIf someone ask me how do I think about Ennis, I'll say he's a weak man
Ang Lee successfully portrayed Ennis as an innuendo of the society.
1.Ennis and Emma's marriage.The story happened from 1963 to 1983.Most of the gay people got marry with women and then hide their sexual orientation under the rock in the rest of the life.But the marriage like this commonly is unreliable and fake.Men must will betray their families for the affairs with other men.
In our modern society,this phenomenon is also really common.According to the research in 2004,75%-80% gay men in China will get marry with females.The rest of them mostly will be single.I take pity to them,and nowadays it's better but still like a hell.
Unsurprisingly,Ennis and Emma's divorced.2.Ennis's fear
Ennis had a miserable childhood.When he was 9 years old,his father took him to see a corpse of a dead gay man.That's quite cold-blooded.I can feel his fear through his innocent eyes.
And that's why he refused to live with Jack again and again.
Like he said in the film:Two men live together?Jack,that's impossible.We can just go there several times a year.
He afraid the outcome like this to happen on them again.
Fear makes him didn't have courage to cross the boundary.
After Jack died,everyday he lived with regrets,sorrows and blamed himself thousands times.
Personally, I had same experience too.
When I was 14 years old in a family meal,when we talked about a homosexual artist.My father said:Jesus,he is a queer.Disgusting!
That hurt me,completely hurt me. I just 14 years old at that time.
That's why I thought homosexuality is a sin for a really long time.
I convince many teenagers sink in the same situation.I just hope they can accept themselvesFor Jack's death
Well,Ang Lee didn't give the clear answer of it.According to some critics,they suppose Jack's wife killed him with her father.Jack had an argument with him.In addition,this enmity had been existing since Jack got marry with Lureen.Scene which Ennis called Lureen,we can find her worn red nail polish.Critics believe that meant blood.Her hands were sinful.Well,that seems make sense.Another outcome
Admittedly,the age was covered by shadows.But if they got a grip,things will not be such sad.The stonewall happened in 1969,and then the gay rights became more and more understandable.In 2001,the gay marriage was legal in Netherlands while they both around 60 years old.They totally can get marry just like Freddie and Stuart in Vicious.
Well,just an idea.I admire every parts of this film.Whatever performance,direction or soundtrack etc.
The film will be shown again next year for to commemorate its 15th anniversary.
Wish I have the opportunity to watch it.",Brokeback Mountain
1335,gr78,Truly Memorable Film-Making - A Tragedy for the 21st Century,10,11 April 2006,"It's a simple story, you might think, if you take a step back and play out the series of events that unfold for the two protagonists in this film. The meeting, the development of a friendship, the progression of intimacy, the parting, the reunion, and - well, I won't spoil it all for you, but I can say this film is THE classic tragedy of the 21st Century. It has been considered by critics as comparable to a Shakespearean drama in regard to the depth of sorrow evident throughout.I viewed this film after hearing a few comments in January 2006. I had bought into our society's stereotypes of the homosexual male and believed this film would continue in the way of other popular, current gay media. When I was informed this film transcended all of that I reluctantly viewed it. For many of you who are doubting this film could mean anything to you I can only hope my comments persuade you to give 'Brokeback' a chance.I was pleasantly surprised by the realistic, raw portrayal of two men falling in love with one another. It is a love portrayed in a way I am unaccustomed to. We have seen the oft-repeated kitschy romance films. They are films that have attempted and failed at producing dramatic and artistic greatness. It is time for something more. It is time for 'Brokeback Mountain'.In 1963 the two protagonists meet and their boss, Joe Aguirre, assigns them to a rather drab mission - to herd 1,000 sheep to the top of a Wyoming mountain and guard them day and night. During the hard and endless work they find time to learn more about each other. Jack pulls Ennis out of his very tight shell and a strong friendship and connection is forged. The two men realize they have the very same goal - to eventually own and work a ranch of their very own. As time progresses their differences and their similarities pull them ever closer to one another. Before long they cannot deny the very real passion they have for one another and they make love.They part with the understanding it was a 'one-shot deal' and the pain wrought by this parting is more than evident. Four years later they reunite and the passion has intensified tenfold. They have built lives with women they have married; now they face the need they have for one another, and a plan is hatched to meet up periodically in the wilderness. Jack, ever the dreamer, would rather fulfill both of their dreams and purchase a ranch together. Ennis refuses the plan based upon a real fear that either of them could be murdered if their secret was ever revealed. And so it is.The strong love they have for one another continues for another sixteen years. The wives who have shared their lives fall to the wayside, broken and shattered from the commitments they thought were stronger than they actually were. We feel their pain as much, possibly stronger in points, than we feel between the two protagonists.The final moments of the film are the most tragic and heartfelt in all I have ever viewed. All in all, this film brings together the passing of two lives, two families; multiple characters who have lived with pain, love, sorrow, and dreams, hopes, and indelible faults. None of the characters is perfect; they are as realistic as any person can be.Let's not forget Annie Proulx, the writer who originally brought this unforgettable story to life in her book 'Close Range : Wyoming Stories'. She created Jack and Ennis and the stunning tapestry of this amazing tale. If it was not for screenplay writers Diana Ossana and Larry McMurtry this film would have not found its medium. If not for the willingness of Ang Lee this film would not have found its depth of artistry. If not for the courageousness of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal this film would not have found its voice.Let's also not forget there are people who want to destroy and mar the story this film represents. They have let their bigotry and hate distort their willingness to give this story a chance. The cast and crew admit they never had a political agenda when they chose to make this film. The film was made to convey a story and a beautiful one at that. No matter what these people may do they can not erase this film nor the poignant message it has conveyed to the thousands who have viewed it, and will view it many years to come.:: Grace R. - Iowa, United States ::",Brokeback Mountain
1336,garymattison,Just a quick question to all,10,11 April 2006,"I may have been really caught up in the moment...but I wanted everyone's point of view on this....Without reading the book, I was really bothered when Ennis called Jack's wife after his passing. She was describing his death one way and Ennis was seeing it a different way. How did Jack really die? Please don't think I am silly, I just really wanted to know what y'all thought. I have to say, I really hope Ennis dis say I love you in Jack's closet after seeing the shirts together, what a touching moment. It took me an hour and trying to find my DVD remote to understand what he said at the very end ""Jack, I swear"". I could watch this movie over and over. Good luck to you all.",Brokeback Mountain

1338,bourgeoisingrid,Disappointed,1,13 April 2006,"I cannot begin, to express how disappointed i was by this movie, it was so fake and forced that i was truly disgusted. Every single minute was another forced emotional sentimental act, it was like, look America gays have feelings too. AHHH!!! it was horrible, lets not forget the fact that ever damn time one of them would ride off, the other one would stand there for a good few minutes awing and gaze lovingly at the other partner riding off in the distance.. it made me want to vomit. It was so forced everything, every second of this movie was so incredible painful to watch. the plot was this... being gay, and a cowboy, and hmmm that's it!!!! Oh and being scared of getting caught. this was all to fake and forced for me to handle, i was truly expecting a thicker plot... that was obviously not given at all!!! p.s i'm not homophobic.. my best friend is gay... he was also disappointed by the plot line.",Brokeback Mountain
1339,kdawv,My take on Brokeback Mountain,10,14 April 2006,"This is without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen. The way it draws the viewer into the characters lives has a ""haunting"" effect. I've heard people say that this movie has a ""haunting"" effect on them and it is very true. It really makes you think about it quite a lot. Ang Lee deserved the Best Directing Oscar for this film and rightly so. The beautiful scenery in this film is breathtaking. I bet that there will be a lot of people traveling to Alberta,Canada to get their own ""Brokeback Mountain"" view of the beautiful scenes from the movie. Heath,Jake,Michelle,and Anne ALL did a fantastic job acting in this film and each one deserves the praise they have each received for their acting. The emotions in this film were real and truly made me feel that I was there with them. I've only had my DVD copy for 1 week and have already viewed it 6 times. I just can not stop thinking about this film. This will be and in my opinion is one of the Greatest Love Story's of all time! A big Thank you goes to Focus Features for having the guts to make this film and to bring a truly great love story to the big screen. BRAVO!!!",Brokeback Mountain
1340,bbtozer,Oh My.......Wow....,10,16 June 2006,"This was indeed the most thought provoking, life changing movie I have ever seen. Brokeback Mountain has virtually transformed my heart and life. Everyone should watch this movie with an open heart. Kudos to Heath and Jake. I believed, I wept, I fell in Love with the passion of them both. How on earth could they not both have won the awards they were nominated for astounds and shocks me. Keep in mind that these two boys are not gay but yet sincerely conveyed a passion that can only come from the depths of ones very soul. Normally I do not follow any particular star or consider myself a ""fan"", but I shall follow these two careers with full anticipation. Thank you boys for your boldness and commitment. This one wins.Added: I truly thought that I was among the minority in the way this movie has impacted me...Wrong! It seems everyone except the narrowest of souls has connected on some substantial level and in some way to this movie. Gay and straight alike appear to be touched. Male and female alike. I too still grieve. I still think about it, I still long for the passion of it and wonder if I will ever experience it for myself. I find myself wanting to go to Wyoming and breath the air, Why? I know that there is nothing there for me to find. I want to stand on that mountain in Canada, put my feet in that creek and weep. My eyes well-up even now as I think about the piercing that movie has given my soul. Perhaps these feelings are symbolic to the fact that Jacks last wishes could not be carried out. If I go, maybe I can heal.",Brokeback Mountain
1341,abbyfuncouple2003,Brokeback Mountain,10,15 April 2006,"I was really impressed with this movie and I think everyone should see it..it is a travesty. I especially think those that are SO opposed to homosexuality should take the time and watch it, it can be an eye opener. It is not a show about sex between 2 men but a love story. No one is immune to love. It shows what mankind can be like regarding that they do not consider the ""norm"" and this is such a shame. I have convinced some people who are ""unsure"" about viewing this movie to borrow my DVD and watch it in the privacy of their own home. I think they should bring out a sequel to this , how I do not know but I think it would be totally awesome. This is definitely a well written and acted movie.",Brokeback Mountain
1342,pjasher,"A beautiful, yet sad film",10,16 April 2006,"Brokeback Mountain touches the heart of any relationship, be it straight or gay. The strong presence of love without the mention of the word resinates on both cultures. When watching the film, you understand this friendship is headed for hardship. All viewers can relate to this feeling.Jacks mother was the real shocker. It proves that even the deeply devout Christian has love and understanding for gay relationships. I pray that the American people as a whole will see there are many forms of love. This story should be a stepping stone for the future.Anyone who has been in a loving relationship should see this film. I can assure you that emotions, sometimes without explanations, will be stirred.",Brokeback Mountain
1343,whiteoutofthemoon,"An Everlasting Gift for those who ""get it"".",10,24 April 2006,"I saw this movie 3 months ago. Admittedly, I'm not really into these romantic/drama type movies. I'm a straight male and was persuaded to go by my girlfriend. I tend to think that I'm open-minded and the subject matter did not bother me too much.What I experienced from this movie is well beyond the romantic storyline. Now, 3 months later, I am still in awe of this amazing work of film-making and storytelling. I am also happy to see that there are millions of others out there who have had the good fortune to have been transformed by this masterpiece. The movie has made me wonder about my own life and choices......this really has nothing to do with the ""gay"" issue, but rather, how I've chosen my career path, past relationships, what my future holds. Will I find myself at a point, like Ennis, where happiness has slipped by due to my own fears and caution? Am I doomed to a life of misery, just because I was afraid to take that one chance? Truth is, I'm terrified, absolutely TERRIFIED, that I may end up one day like Ennis at the end, looking out of that lonely window, trapped in a wasted life full of regrets, only because I missed out on my chance for happiness. I've read some great reviews on this site, but I continue to be baffled by the level of ignorance of some of the reviews I've seen. I am not talking about the negative reviews...I can not expect everyone to like this movie. I'm talking about the reviews from people who have NOT even seen the movie.....I mean, what could you be possibly thinking to comment negatively on a movie you have not even seen, nor intend to see? I've read with great amusement those who have called this movie a ""gay agenda"", an attempt to ""homosexualize"" America, a travesty against the image of the ""American cowboy"". If you can just open up your feeble minds just one second to see that it is none of that at all. This movie is based on a short story by a mature woman; adapted screenplay by a great American writer who wrote great westerns; and directed by a Chinese family man and master filmmaker. Exactly where do you see a ""gay agenda"" in there? What possible reason would any of these people have to ""promote"" homosexuality? Are you so out of touch with reality and paranoid that you would think that all the studios in Hollywood got together for a secret meeting one day, and decided that it was time to spread a gay agenda across the US and world, and that this was the movie to do it? And do you think that there were some marketing geniuses who created all the ""hype"" falsely, and therefore that is why there has been so much talk about the movie? I'm just frustrated with all the stupidity and sheer ignorance and intolerance that I have seen and read about this movie. It is a story, a great story, and an amazing act of STORYTELLING......that is all you need to know about it; no politics, no sacrilege, JUST A STORY, about two men, at this one time, in this one place. Can you understand that very simple premise? I have a good friend who I used to consider ""sensitive"". She would cry when hearing a certain Mozart symphony, or be in tears when she saw a Botticelli painting for the first time. I mean, WTF, crying over music or a painting? I used to tease her about that, but instead of being embarrassed, she would look at me, really in pity,...""your loss"". It was later that I came to realize that there was really something wrong with me, not her. She had the capacity and ""gift"" to feel the power of such masterpieces, and because of that, her life is more enriched. While I appreciate the mastery of classical composers or artists, I just did not ""get it"". That's how it goes with this movie, and I'm happy to say I ""get it"". There are those who ""get it"", and those who don't. And those who do will have an impossible time explaining why to those who don't. It's not really your fault that you may not get it...you just don't, no worries. But I think it's funny if you are frustrated or poke fun at those who do. Because, in essence, we're not the ones with the problem. I feel my life and outlook have been made better, and I'm a better person, because of this one movie, a masterpiece. Can a movie really do that? Crazy stuff, huh? And if you have a problem with that, do you really think I care? It's your loss, you know? I have nothing to prove to you; it's not my job to convince you. For those who ""get it"", we're the lucky ones, and it'll be our little secret. For the rest of you, I hope you find the inspiration for your life in some other form, before it's way too late; or else, like Ennis, you may quickly find yourself metaphorically shuffling around all alone in an old trailer....forever doomed to wonder what could have been.",Brokeback Mountain
1344,korgriff,Absolutely Breathtaking!!!,10,16 April 2006,"I live in a small town and I hate to say that I went into this with any preconceived notions, I hope I didn't, what I did go into this with was curiosity. I was NOT disappointed!!! This film is haunting!!!! Absolutely beautiful! Not just the scenery but the story and the actors and everything!!! I can only hope that all of us find the kind of depth of character and love that is portrayed so perfectly in this outstanding story. It's love in its purest form!! I cant seem to stop thinking about it. Jake Gyllenhall and Heath Ledger are absolutely breathtaking. I LOVE the expression of love between them. Jake, the expressive romantic and Heath, the stalwart salt of the earth. I was touched and moved by the performance and beauty of the lives of these two men. They live out their complex lives apart and come together with such ferocity that it scorches the viewer. You end up with the same feeling as with Romeo and Juliet. They ABSOLUTELY belong together but, in their society, cannot possibly find a way. I had no idea how deeply and on how many levels that this story would affect me. It is hauntingly beautiful, way after the credits roll Jack and Ennis will haunt your heart (if you have one). This story is NOT what you expect!!! It's so much better and so much more!!!!!",Brokeback Mountain
1345,gianfranco-negri,A masterpiece. A touching and haunting love story.,10,17 April 2006,"Absolutely amazing! This movie hit me like a shot in the heart. It's a beautiful story about deep and genuine LOVE, denied by society. How could some - luckily, very few - critics slap the easy tag of ""gay cowboy movie"" on this film, I wonder? ""Brokeback Mountain"" made me think about my own life, about the force of genuine feelings: those who are lucky enough to find true love in this - short - life should keep it like a treasure because this is ultimately what counts. This film also made me think about the cruelty of some people, and the iniquities that homosexual people have suffered in different parts of the world, in different ages. I don't accept some criticism, according to which the characters are immoral because they are HOMOSEXUAL and cheat on their wives. Who said so didn't understand much of this film. ENNIS has no tools to come to terms with his feelings and sexual attraction to Jack. He was brought up with a sense of horror towards homosexuality, which he considers as an aberrant condition to be ashamed of and repress: unfortunately, this is what was taught to him. The social background he comes from doesn't enable him to cope with this situation. He literally swallows his feelings and hardly ever expresses them (well, he hardly ever speaks). He desperately tries to forget about Jack and Brokeback Mountain and live a ""normal"" and ""respectable"" life with his wife. But, as the movie tag line reads, LOVE IS FORCE OF NATURE, and you cannot resist it, whoever you are: why should one's life be hell, just because he received a twisted education, imbued with religious dogmas or social conventions, I wonder? All the characters, including the two wives, are ultimately unhappy and defeated. But whose fault is it? Ennis's? I found his character deeply moving and absolutely realistic. Ang Lee's intent, however, is not to deliver a ""J'ACCUSE"" movie, but just to recount a tragic and vivid love story between two human beings, like it was in the original Annie Proulx short narrative. This is Ang Lee's best film by far, and one the best movies I have ever seen; at least, the one which struck me the most. It may sound pathetic, but I must confess that it's been the very first time I cried for a film... I can't get OUT OF MY HEAD its intense images, the laconic, unforgettable lines, its haunting music. The pacing is calm: the writer of the original short story, Annie Proulx, and the two screenwriters, McMurtry and Ossana, managed to depict this peculiar and, at the same time, universal American story (which is set in 1963-1983 Wyoming) with few but incisive masterstrokes. What makes this movie great is its perfect mixture of strong and poetic images (it's hard to believe they gave the Oscar for best CINEMATOGRAPHY to ""Memoirs of a Geisha""!), its melancholic MUSIC, the meaningful silence and facial expressions of the characters, the scarce, poignant and unforgettable LINES... There are no long dialogs: this would have been unrealistic, since it's ultimately two young (and later mature) uneducated cowboys, grown up in the narrow spaces of a provincial rural society. The actors' performances are absolutely stunning: HEATH LEDGER is in my opinion the best of all, and it's a real shame he didn't get the awards he deserved! His astounding portrayal of Ennis does smack of loneliness and alienation. I was very disappointed too when I saw that the ACADEMY members didn't give ""Brokeback Mountain"" the Oscar as best picture. I think this is outrageous and a clear indication that the Academy Awards do not - too often in my humble opinion - mean quality, but, on the contrary, are just the result of unpredictable marketing strategies or old-fashioned ""ideologies"". I also read that many of the voters don't even watch all the nominated films. In this case, I think a lot of voters acted out their prejudices against a still controversial theme, that is, gay love and homosexuality, in the secret of their voting booths. I think that even here in THIS SITE it's unacceptable to see that 9% of the voters gave a 1 vote. I'm sure most these people didn't even see the film, and want to express their anger towards the gay love theme, and to decrease the average mark of the film.Yet, I am glad this masterpiece received dozens of other ACCOLADES, among which the ""Leone d'Oro"" (the golden lion) at the Venice Film Festival, back at the film's world premiere in September 2005: being Italian myself, I'm proud we paved the way for such an amazing and moving piece of art.",Brokeback Mountain
1346,srmchristian0103,What a truly amazing film.,10,18 April 2006,"Oh, Where do I begin. First, lets start by saying this is truly a must see film. If you are finding yourself a bit racist or having a difficult time understanding the concept of homosexuality, watch this movie, it will change not only YOU but the way you might see things or perceive them for that matter. When I saw this movie it melted me in a way I have yet to be melted by another film. All I saw was LOVE, true love at that. Despite it being two men, it didn't matter it was all just love. Too many people are close minded and find it gross or disgusting, it is nothing short of beautiful. Open your mind and your heart and watch it, it would surprise me if you didn't love it.",Brokeback Mountain
1347,jblin,"A haunting, deeply moving, life changing film.",10,19 April 2006,"I am a heterosexual woman, happily married with three children, liberal in my attitudes who went to see ""Brokeback Mountain"" out of curiosity. I knew very little about the movie other than the ""Gay Cowboy"" label and the actors involved. I'll admit I was on edge not really looking forward to viewing homosexual sex, but was interested in what all the hype was about. The first sex scene in the tent was shocking, but the rest of the film was a good ""forbidden love"" story. That was nearly 2 months ago and I have not been able to shake ""Brokeback Mountain"" out of my thoughts. After my first viewing the story kept creeping back into my head and heart. Within 3 days I had to go back to the theater (alone - which I never do) to see it again. I then bought Annie Proulx's collection of short stories ""Close Range"" which includes ""Brokeback Mountain"" and read the original story (as well as several others). I began listening to the Academy Award nominated (and winning) score via NPR's internet site and then bought the soundtrack. Many nights I have woken up with one of the songs or part of the score running through my head. I took my husband to see it (he actually liked it more than I had anticipated) and then I saw it 2 more times at the theater by myself while my kids were at school (again something I never do). I bought the ""Story to Screenplay"" and read about the making of the movie. This movie has changed my attitude towards the ones I love - my husband and I make love more often with a tenderness and passion that had been lost in recent years and we are nicer and more caring towards each other in our every day dealings with one another. This has been a conscious change on my part that has elicited a sub-conscious like change in him.This movie actually came together like a ""perfect storm"" with the final product ""the movie"" making the individual parts greater in hindsight. Diana Ossana first read Annie Proulx's short story during a bout of insomnia while she was staying in Larry Mc Murtry's home (her writing partner). She reacted, in what she later thought in the light of day was overly exaggerated, in an intensely emotional way to the pain, love, loss and regret in the story: two young, uneducated, rough men, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist, from ranch families thrown together on a lonely Wyoming mountain far from others for the summer tending sheep, who fall in love and because of the social norms of the time (1963) are not ever able to fully realize a life together. When she reread it the next day she realized that her emotions of the night before were well founded and convinced Larry Mc Murtry to read the short story. Before the day was out they had written a letter to Annie Proulx to propose optioning her story for a screenplay (using their own money - something they had never done before). Their screen play expanded the sparse short story and fleshed out the 2 women Jack and Ennis eventually marry. That was 1997 and it took nearly 7 years before the movie began production. Ang Lee of ""Sense and Sensibility"" as well as ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" was signed on as director and they were able to then get financing. Diana Ossana had envisioned Heath Ledger as the quiet, brooding Ennis Del Mar and Larry Mc Murtry agreed after seeing Ledger's performance in ""Monster Ball."" The casting was ""perfection"": Jake Gyllenhaal as the optimistic, passionate Jack Twist; Michelle Williams as Ennis' long suffering wife; Anne Hathaway the aggressive, business minded wife of Jack; and Randy Quaid as the hard nosed rancher who hired Ennis and Jack to tend his sheep. Adding to the ""perfect storm"" was the excellent music by Gustavo Santaolalla - this is a score that will rise up in your mind and twist your heart in ways you never thought possible. The cinematography of Rodrigo Prieto (he also has a bit part as the Mexican prostitute) will at times take your breath away.This is a movie to be experienced fully - the story, the music, the unbelievable acting by a young cast, and the unrelentingly fine directing that makes each scene relevant to the story. The slow pace at times allows one to savor the moments, the feelings, the things unsaid, the facial expressions and body language that say more than one can speak in words - it is all incredible. Annie Proulx herself wrote about seeing the movie: ""Seeing the film disturbed me. I felt that, as the ancient Egyptians had removed a corpse's brain through the nostril with a slender hook before mummification, the cast and crew of this film, from the director down, had gotten into my mind and pulled out images. Especially did I feel this about Heath Ledger, who knew better than I how Ennis felt and thought, whose intimate depiction of that achingly needy ranch kid builds with frightening power. It is an eerie sensation to see events you have imagined through little black marks on a page, loom up before you in an overwhelming visual experience. I realized that I, as a write, was having the rarest film trip: my story was not mangled but enlarged into huge and gripping imagery that rattle minds and squeezed hearts."" See the movie!",Brokeback Mountain
1348,herpipeness,Keeps on moving me...,10,15 May 2006,"This movie stayed with me forever after seeing it. The music is sublime and so evocative. I loved the story, the acting, the cinematography - everything about it, as difficult as parts were to watch. It made me cry and cry but was such a testament to love - and to all the people who have paved the way for those of us who enjoy freedom today and in the future. I was moved by the simplicity of the characters - people with no context for their feelings and experiences, not reacting to anything they knew or had read about or seen, it seems. Being gay was not a part of their life-scape, but the feelings they had for one another were inescapably compelling. Truly sad was the pain caused to each one's wife; and it seemed realistic that both handled it differently. A lovely, lovely love story.",Brokeback Mountain
1349,ken-790,Incredibly film in all respects,10,22 April 2006,"I guess I am the last person on earth to see ""Brokeback Mountain"". Wow. What an incredible film. It restores one's faith that in an age of endless squeals of what were originally bad movies in the first place, it is still possible for a great film to find a large appreciative audience without endless car chases, car wrecks, stereotypical characters, buddy banter, and gratuitous sex scenes.It is: A love story. A story of missed love and missed dreams. A story of despair. A story of hope. A story of life. A same sex Romeo and Juliet with a broader treatment of their separate lives and inner conflicts. It's a great and timeless story.One cannot help but admire the irony of using the masculine cowboy image. Just one of many stereotypes that this movies subtlety challenges.Yes, the directing and acting are flawless. The Ennis character is one of few words. But Heath Ledger nevertheless conveys the feelings with strong emotional energy. Someone once said that a film actor's most powerful tools are not the delivery of his lines, but his eyes, face and body language. Ledger makes this point exceptionally well.And let us not forget, that on top of all of this great directing and acting, there is this breathtaking cinematography that makes you want to just drop everything and head for the big sky country.This is truly a great film.",Brokeback Mountain
1350,domifeike,a movie so close to life.,10,5 November 2021,"This movie is in my top 5 of all time, because of many reasons. It gives you emotion on a level so visceral, it stays with you for a long time. The cinematography is simply stunning - every single shot could be a screensaver. The soundtrack is also amazing. This is not a political movie about oppression of homosexual people, and while it touches on issues like that, it is mainly about the oppression of feelings. About longing. About time, about unrequited love and learning to be vulnerable. About things that are so common to anyone's life, it is hard not to feel a rollercoaster of emotions while watching this. I keep going back to this movie a lot. And even after the 9th watch or so, I am still overwhelmed by the emotions that hit me when watching this one.",Brokeback Mountain
1351,touchstoneconcrete,Disturbing,7,24 April 2006,"I saw the movie a few days ago and the only way to describe my reaction to it is ""disturbing"". I don't think it was a ""gay cowboy movie"" or a ""love story"" as I'd heard in the media. Now that I've seen it for myself, I think it's more of a human tragedy than anything else. I'm glad I waited to see it on DVD because I often had to replay scenes in order to understand Heath Ledger's mumbling dialogue. Michelle Williams did a great job; it's too bad Ann Hathaway's character wasn't equally developed. I didn't completely believe a woman could be so oblivious.What stood out the most for me was the irony and contradiction. Ennis didn't entertain the fantasy of living with Jack so that he could be a father and support his family. But ultimately, he loses his family and is mostly absent from his daughters' lives. So what was the point of the sacrifice? And in the confrontation sequence in the mountains when Jack complains about not being satisfied with the occasional high-altitude you-know-what, Ennis goes ballistic when he learns of Jack's dalliances in Mexico. But later when Jack's father reveals Jack's relationship with Malone, Ennis doesn't appear hurt or devastated by the betrayal.",Brokeback Mountain
1352,Sinful_Desire1025,Brokeback Mountains ROCKS,10,24 April 2006,"I watched this movie, Brokeback Mountain, a total of 5 times in a day. Once seen in my opinion you will not get enough. Anything heard about it being ""Just a stupid gay cowboy movie"" Are wrong. The passion and love, the characters put into this movie make it a great and enjoyable one. The actors and actresses have developed GREAT, outstanding characters that make you fall in love with them. Not to mention the movie itself, the setting and such also puts a lot into it. It will make you fill moved, sad, passionate, loving, and so much more. I strongly urge you to watch this movie, it's one of the best! I love it and I think you will do the same. So go now and rent, buy whatever. But be ready to feel something.",Brokeback Mountain
1353,jane_377,Brilliant,10,24 April 2006,"Hi. I wondered about the ending too. I,ve gone over and over it and to be honest, the more you think about, the more it doesn't really make sense. If you have a flat tyre, it,s because you have a puncture, so how can a tyre with a hole in it be pumped up let alone blow up. Also I think that the ""flashback"" we see is how Ennis imagined it, as soon as Lureen mentioned a tyre, because of the tyre iron incident with the guy when he was a kid. I think, I may be wrong, but I think, it had something to do with Lureens dad. Remember he hated Jack from day one. He was never good enough for his precious daughter, he was a rodeo cowboy and he probably did find out he was gay, maybe from that rancher, I don't know. I think that maybe he had him threatened and beaten up, and told to get lost and never come back, and then let everyone think he was dead because it was easier that way. IF it was an accident as was said, why couldn't we see it? Then we would have known for sure. There was no reason why we couldn't see that, IF thats what really happened, and I don't think it did. I still think it,s a great film either way, but it needs some sort of closure, and we haven't had that. Plus the author said herself in some interviews she did about the film that people are sick and tired of disasters and unhappy endings, and what do we get? Another disaster. She,s right, we ARE sick of misry and unhappy endings. Sure, they would be obsticles to overcome, as there are in any relationship, more so with two men probably, but after everything they,d been through, after 20 years, for crying out loud, WHY couldn't they end up together? Everything does not ALWAYS have to end in disaster. Happy endings DO happen in real life too, only occasionally I know but they do. For Gods sake, bring them back and give us and them a happy ending. I think after all that they deserve it, and so do we. I shall keep watching it though because in places it makes me cry laughing, but it annoys me knowing it,s all going to end in tears every time I do.",Brokeback Mountain
1354,jhg20852,Better late than never,10,27 April 2006,"I can not get this movie out of my mind. I have, in a way, had a similar life experience, picking up at the time the movie ends. There are many things that I can relate to in this film. In 1983 I met my partner. I was dating women prior to that point, even in one very serious hetro relationship, we almost got married. I was following the same pattern as the guys in BBM. Being an only child in a relatively small town living with my parents, you followed the ""rules"". Well I did until my first meeting with my partner. Lot's of drama happened over the years, but the good thing is that we are still together, 23 years later and just as happy (a bit older and fatter) as our first meeting. My dad did not speak to me for a few years when he discovered my lifestyle. And even years later when I would go on vacation with my parents my dad would wait out in the car and refuse to enter OUR home or speak to my partner. It was not until my dad was diagnosed with terminal cancer 3 years ago that he came around and accepted my partner. And it was my partner that drove my dad in the car for 3 hours to our home to comfort him during his last few days. I will never know what was said during that car ride, except that my partner said my dad was a ""good man"". After seeing the movie on DVD, and watching it 4 times from Netflix, I felt the very very rare urge to purchase the film. Every time I watch I see something new. But one of the best things to come out of this for me is.....I look at my partner and smile, and realize how lucky we are to have each other, and now more than ever I cherish these moments. I just wish Jack and Ennis could have done the same. I sincerely hope that others.....gay or str8 discover and enjoy the good times with someone special.",Brokeback Mountain
1355,discoverjongen,Unlocking emotions,9,29 April 2006,"Yesterday I saw Brokeback mountain, today it feels like I'm broken myself. This movie does something with you, even more afterwards. I will not tell about what happens in the movie, just go and find out yourself.What makes this movie special is that it takes you to a world you all knew once. Where no rules are, no obligations or restrictions exist. It is the world we knew as kids, youngsters with dreams, hope and unlimited possibilities. The love we felt for parents, friends and others was real, could not be questioned since we wouldn't know how to. But growing up or just being a member of society changes everything. You cannot just be who you want to be, whether you want to be gay (as in the movie) or want to be a singer (but just lack some talent) Reality sometimes puts out the fire of our dreams or makes it very small. A second element which is shown so subtle, is the importance of communication. Jack/Ennis don't tell how they feel (or at least not really easily), Alma doesn't tell she knows and so on. The movie shows how this silence slowly digests these people Ang Lee shows this in a magnificent way.Everyone on this planet has had some experiences in his or her life which are remembered with the simple phrase ""what if"". So gay or straight, you will always recognize some of your own feelings and thoughts. And even if you can't recognize something in the story at all (which I think is impossible), still the images of the beautiful mountains and locations are worth your money. If this would have been a theatre piece, I would have given everyone a standing ovation!",Brokeback Mountain
1356,sparxjes92,I Love this movie,10,29 April 2006,"I saw this movie and cried my eyes out. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my entire life. I truly applaud Ang Lee and all of the actors and actresses for going this far. Everyone says that this is a ""Gay Cowboy Movie"" but it is just a love story. I hope that no matter what their beliefs, everyone sees this movie, maybe it will change their perspective. All of the people associated with this movie deserve the highest respect in the movie industry, for they have crossed the line, and have succeeded. I absolutely adore this movie and I hope that soon enough, everyone will have seen it. There were many inspirational lines and scenes in this movie, but Jake Gyllenhaal's line of ""I wish I knew how to quit you"" was heart-breaking and amazingly saddening. I am so glad that I had the opportunity to see this movie, and I encourage all others to see it, too.",Brokeback Mountain
1357,lomo40,So beautiful I can't get it out of my head!,10,2 May 2006,"I just rented Brokeback Mountain a couple days ago, and like so may others have posted on here, it wont let me go! I can't stop thinking about it, it's so haunting! I was so happy to see that I wasn't the only one feeling this way after seeing it, especially since not many of my friends have seen it, and I feel like I want to talk to someone about it because it's so heavy on my heart! It seems like some people have taken issue with the character Ennis because of his few words and apparent lack of emotion (until the end), but I think this makes his character even more beautiful, because he embodies all the pain of loss and regret in the world that words can't come close to describing. I think maybe if people don't like this film is because it is so painful, and rather than relate to the pain, we find it easier to just call it a bad movie - we do this because it hits us deep in the secret places of our hearts, and rather then let it break us, we try to break the movie. I think this film is also amazing in the way it speaks to people of different ages and nationalities, uniting us in a universal way that goes beyond gender, race, and age; uniting us in a way that attests to the hidden recesses of the human heart. It's beautiful. A huge thank you to Ang Lee, and all the amazing actors. You touched me so very deeply.",Brokeback Mountain
1358,suninmyhairxox,I guess I am just not sure......No woman No cry,5,4 May 2006,I watched the movie alone and usually I am a big wimp and cry at the drop of a hat. I have to say I am not sure how much I actually liked the movie. I found the overtone of the movie miserable. The direct contrast between everyone being so damned miserable and then there is that gorgeous scenery(I did love the scenery)kind of left me ??I didn't care for Ennis and his brand of husbandry. As a woman I would have freaked if that were happening to me with a man or a woman. They both cheated on their spouses. That stinks.I did not understand the transition between being guys eating beans and drinking one minute and then that animalistic tent romp the next ( the spit application didn't do much for me either):))~ There wasn't much flow everything was so in your face and abrupt.I think the actors did a good job with their roles I am just not sure I enjoyed the movie for what it was. In a nut shell I think there wasn't much flow to the movie....I am a loving person and have no problems with people loving one another no matter what the situation.... in this movie i didn't feel the love.,Brokeback Mountain

1360,tmshewmake,Brokeback Mountain is a haunting love story that will last through the ages,10,10 May 2006,"This film has stuck with me more than any other film I have ever seen in my life. I watched it 5 days ago and simply cannot stop thinking about it. I wanted to immediately watch it again once it was over. I just didn't want the story to end, especially the way it did. The characters Ennis and Jack, superbly played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, the absolutely stunning directorial work done by Ang Lee, and the heart-wrenchingly beautiful musical score by Gustavo Santaolalla, have all been swimming in my head and heart nonstop these last few days and nights. I have been profoundly affected by this film. I plan on seeing it again and again and listening to the original score and reading the story over and over again as well. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves a good love story.",Brokeback Mountain
1361,natalie_watson,Brokeback,10,9 May 2006,"Brokeback Mountain was the best movie I saw this year by far. This Western movie is about two cowboys falling in love while staying out on Brokeback. Unfortunately the society they are living in frowns upon a relationship like theirs, so they avoid it and ruin what could've been a really great thing. The movie stars Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Their performances are exceptional and no one else could have done better. The movie was filmed in Calgary, AB, which suited the movies atmosphere best. A true western area.It's a very controversial theme, but overall a well-done and completely original movie. I recommend seeing it.",Brokeback Mountain
1362,fionasonder-1,Brokeback broke my heart,10,13 May 2006,"I felt compelled to leave a comment here because I've never seen a movie that has moved me so deeply like Brokeback Mountain did.The movie wasn't as half as good as it is without the perfect performances of the entire cast. You could actually turn off the sound and just look at the facial expressions and gestures and you would still understand the story. Heath Ledger as a lonesome cowboy is simply breathtaking. His pain and sadness, expressed with few words and gestures is absolutely heartbreaking. It is amazing, how a twenty something year old man understands such a complex character and he shows it in every single gesture. Ang Lee's images are extremely powerful. You can almost smell the grass and feel the wind. He knows exactly what he does, no second is wasted. I love his understated and subtle style of directing. There is a lot of silence, but the atmosphere is always intense and emotionally charged.The movie is more than the sum of its parts, though. I can't find a logical explanation for the fascination that this story has for so many people around the world. ""The secret of Brokeback Mountain"" (That's the title for this movie here in Europe) will always be kept together with Jack's ashes up there in the Mountains. The only things left for Ennis' are the bittersweet memories and his longing that echoes now eternally through the mountain of Brokeback Mountain- and through your soul, long after the last credits have rolled down. -This is a terrific movie!",Brokeback Mountain
1363,furrypaws,lil darlin,10,14 May 2006,"Well here I am joining the legions of people who have never felt compelled to write a review before and doubt I'll say anything that hasn't already been said, but hell I get my 10 stars in and bump up the good reviews!I would recommend you read the story before watching the film - first of all (if you didn't know by now) you'll be prepared for how it's all going to end and get those tissues ready. Secondly, I found it gave me more understanding about the characters and their actions (or lack of).Some reviews I have read complain that there seems to be no reason for why these two guys end up as lovers, no development of their motivation. For me that is the whole point, these aren't two men who spend years getting to know each other, discussing their feelings, blah, blah, blah. It's raw and OK it's lust but it is also love. How can anyone not see that. The scene where Jack is falling asleep on his feet is probably one of the most tender moments I have ever seen in a film.You could read 60 books of poetry about love and it would pall to nothing compared to the looks between Jack and Ennis without a word spoken. That must reflect on the great ability of Heath and Jake both, IMO, giving the performance of their lives - so they might as well give up acting now!Wonderful, beautiful film that will haunt you forever. Unless you have no soul...",Brokeback Mountain
1364,cayjay,Just plain good,9,17 May 2006,"When I heard the hype about the movie, I believed it--that this was a movie about gay cowboys. So I didn't go see it. Finally, though, curiosity won out, and I rented the movie. Waiting until the kids were asleep, I stayed up till 3 am to watch the movie twice.This did not strike me as a movie about gay cowboys. It seemed to me it was a movie about desperation, mistakes, love, regret, and loss that just happened to have two men in the romantic lead. It could just as easily have been about a man and woman in love, but not to the people they were married to. The point is that the actors, and though the women were good Heath and Jake made the movie, moved me so that I was involved in their relationship and pain outside of the fact that it was a gay relationship. Both of these young men presented roles that were amazing in their depth and believability.I think this is one of the saddest movies I have ever seen, in that no one won, no one got what they wanted, needed, or deserved out of life. I recommend this movie to anyone who can watch it with an open heart and not with preconceived ideas. I have read comments here about the Conservative Christian response to this movie. I am one of those conservative Christians. I was not disgusted by the men in the movie, but very definitely moved by their love and loss.",Brokeback Mountain

Even as a married straight female I felt the deep emotions of both actors but it was Ennis who really took my breath away. He made you feel everything!!! At the end I was left with a hole in my heart for the loss Ennis suffered with losing Jack and the regret and deep pain from not following his heart. I know I will never see another movie that has moved me so deeply as this one has and is still doing. I'm dancing because I am not alone with my thoughts and feelings about this movie. To all of you out there that have found that special love that will last you for eternity, I say Godbless you!!!! How rare a love like that is and maybe this movie will help others to follow their hearts no matter what. For those out there who can't see the forest through the trees or who has never chased a dream, I feel sorry for you's. Life is short, give it all you have!!! Live to Love and Love to Live, don't live with regrets because that's not living. To all of you who played a part in making this movie I salute you!!!!! To all of you who felt the love, the beauty, the excitement, the aching, the pain, the sadness and the emptiness at the end, thank you for being real and honest with yourselves.

1366,daphne7661,I Never Saw It Coming! I Was Hit and Hit Hard!!!!!,10,24 May 2006,"If you see this film, and you SHOULD, you will know what I mean. Of course, there are some, even friends of mine, who have seen it, even liked it, a lot, but didn't quite ""get it."" As you can probably see from the rest of the viewer comments, many of us ""got it"" and got it good. Those of us who ""got it"" (and you know who you are), well, I believe we were the chosen ones. We are the ones who will take with us a new lease on life  a responsibility to life. Never again will I allow myself the complacency of life without love or at least never allow myself not to connect with my fellow human beings. I have, for the first time, in a long time, looked into people's faces on the street, when before I would keep my head down. I talk more to people, I walk more with people, I compliment and am kinder to people. I'm reaching out when I knew not long ago that I was starting to check out. It is simply amazing what has come over me.This film is bigger than life. It is bigger than the viewer. It is bigger even than the portrayal of Jack & Ennis' huge love for each other. It is definitely bigger than the ignorant and negative commentaries by some naysayers, and it hits you when and where you least expect it.First, let me say, that I asked myself, where did these two young actors come from??!! I think I knew the Gyllenhaal name, but didn't have a clue as to the Ledger name and couldn't have put a face to either if asked. Well, I know them now! And I will never ever be the same because of their brave, dedicated and intimate portrayals of Jack Twist and Ennis del Mar. I've now heard other actors' names who were considered for these roles, and I can't even imagine any one of them pulling off the chemistry these two young men did.Knowing I needed to see it again and then again, I purchased the DVD. I have watched it probably 15 times already, trying each time to pull it as close to me as I could, but, like Jack and Ennis, I simply don't ever get quite close enough to it, requiring me to watch it, and particular scenes in it, over and over like some strange obsession.This story of pure and natural love leaped off the screen, grabbed hold of my heart and has refused to let go. It has been a month since I first saw it, and not a minute of each day goes by without my thinking about it. It didn't matter to me, somehow, that, in this movie, these two lovers were men. To me, it was just two people in love. The actors' abilities to show their characters' passion, connection to each other and intimacy just blew my doors off. I cried like I've never cried before. SOBBED during the last ½ hour. SOBBED again for an hour after it ended. SOBBED reading other viewer comments. SOBBED at the faintest memory of any one scene, and there are so many good ones, I couldn't begin to pick them out here. What on earth is it???!!!! I think I have finally decided that it must have been that the stars were aligned from Annie Proulx' raw and somewhat crass short story, to its publication in the New Yorker oh so many years ago, to Diana Ossana reading that New Yorker issue, to her and Larry McMurtry's screenplay and then placed into the caring hands of director, Ang Lee, cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, and then, finally, the casting of these two fine young actors in the lead roles. It all clicked like a fine wine or a classic work of art.Jake Gyllenhaal is everything he needs to be and more for his perfect portrayal of optimistic, wide-eyed and loving Jack Twist. He really shows his bones in the scene where he drives all the way from Texas at the news of Ennis' divorce, only to find that nothing has changed. His metamorphosis from elation to devastation is pure perfection. My heart felt as though it had been ripped from my very center. And what well did Heath Ledger go to in order to bring beautiful, introverted and emotionally scarred Ennis del Mar to life? He is simply  flawless  right down to even the remotest of scenes, such as his obvious heavy-heartedness when coming down from the mountain, early, knowing his once in a lifetime love (because he believes it must) will end. Absolutely perfect! See this movie, and, if you ""get it"", welcome to the club",Brokeback Mountain
1367,jorge2144,Jorge,10,20 May 2006,"I do not know if the story shown in this movie is a real one. I hope not, since I cannot think about living in a world where people are killed just by thinking differently. This movie presents different ways in which people express their love. Sometimes, the way it is expressed conveys a lot of suffering and grief for the person and those around him (her). In a society that claims to be a perfect judge, the movie shows how people have to live a double life in order to fulfill their feelings and be within society's expectations at the same time. We all need to remember that Jesus came to this world for the people in need, not for the people that were saved and doing what was expected. It is everybody's responsibility to lay a helping hand to those that we know are in need of finding themselves. To let them know that Jesus loves them and his arms are always open to hug whoever wants to turn his (her) life on the right track. People should live their lives happily and freely, and doing the right thing. After all, if there is anyone who is free of guilt in this life, then he (she) can throw the first stone. Let's all remember that one day, we all will be present before God and our lives will be judged by him. To Ag Lee goes our congratulations for an excellent film. To the main actors, Ledger and Gyllenhaal, we tip our hats before them for a magnificent performance in a very controversial subject.

I waited for the DVD. If I have been more open to the fact that it wasn't just a gay film...but bottom line, it's a Love Story. Not just any love story...a long term love story. The pure desperation in these 2 characters to be together just unnerves even the hardest critic.I think...and I believe that I went in with the mentality of an ignorant person and expected to be grossed out and I came back thinking to myself, why couldn't they end up together? I wanted a happy ending! Heath Ledger will continue to give his best, as he's done in this film. I felt sad, mortified and even a bit jealous of the connection these 2 people had.

Man, this was Over-hyped. Over-emotional. Kept waiting for the ""Produced by Ross Hunter and Douglas Sirk"" credit. Dialog reminded me of Lonesome Dove,but sounds like Larry McMurtry said ""let's make' em gay, instead"". These guys were weak, weak, weak. I thought Ang Lee was overrated in ""Ice Storm "" , and ""Brokeback"" basically just confirmed my suspicion that he seems to appeal to the emotionally-wrought and depressed crowd.

1373,christopher_revilla2002,A real and lasting love despite all the odds,10,27 May 2006,"""Brokeback Mountain"" is one of the most heartbreaking, yet inspiring love stories ever produced. It shows that two sensitive, very real men can love each other and defy all the conventions for many years. The performances of Jake Gylenhaal and Heath Ledger are unforgettable, just amazing. When Jack Twist (Gylenhaal) rails at Ennis Del Mar about the rarity of their times together over the years, you can feel his heart breaking with each word. Many people who have watched ""Brokeback"" have described it as a sad story, and almost go so far as to suggest the central relationship (between the two cowboys) is a failed one. Nothing could be further from the truth. Ennis and Jack truly love each other, despite their marriages to women and their lack of time alone with one another. While death ultimately separates the two lovers far too soon, their love remains unquestionably real, a triumph in a life filled with so much loneliness. Their love is the central metaphor of this picture.It is one of the best films ever.",Brokeback Mountain
1374,Meg9502,life at its purest,10,29 May 2006,"The first time I watched this movie was with my sister and her boyfriend, and it was very awkward, and I didn't even get to see the end because my Dad came home early, and he didn't want me watching this, I guess because he thinks that if I see it, I will want to become gay or something.However, I went against his wishes, despite his warning. I am eternally grateful for going against his wishes. After watching it the second time, I can't even begin to describe how moved I was by it. At first it didn't really hit me, but later that night as I stepped into the shower, thinking about it nonstop all day, the impact of what I had seen hit me full force, and I just collapsed there in the shower, sobbing uncontrollably. I will admit I have been a sucker for movies like Titanic and Romeo+Juliet, but after watching them they never stayed in my mind for long, and NEVER like this. I have never yearned and at the same time despaired for love like this, and the love isn't even mine. I hope someday in my life I meet someone and have a connection, a passionate love like Jack and Ennis did. I hope though, for us, we can actually be together.I had watched this the first time preparing myself for the love scenes, and although I am for gay openness all the way, I admit I was a little flipped out at the thought of love scene between my two favorite actors. I've just never seen it before. I think that made me sidetrack what the movie was about. But after the second time, I just could not believe it. My heart literally ached so much I didn't know what to do, it ached for Jack and Ennis, and for everyone in the world who ever couldn't love someone because of a certain situation, whether because society's standards or something else. The movie was deeper than anyhting I've ever experienced, and the weight of it was almost too much. The movie was about life, and life in its purest form, pure love and pure anguish. It made me so happy that it's ending wasn't the usual happy ending, but one of regret, and at the same time hope, for it truly shows that life goes on and that true, deep, passionate, life-lasting love will always be with you no matter what. It doesn't die.I have heard some things by friends, especially guys, complaining that yes, it was sweet and tragic, but love like that doesn't happen to gay people. That they wouldn't have been homophobic to Ennis or Jack, but just to the regular gay people. I think that yes, that is true, love like that does not often happen between two men, but to tell the truth, it seldom happens between a man and a woman either. Love today is so vague and so broad, commercialized and cheapened by our society. People say I love you not because they do, but because they think they should, or because some other circumstance. People marry for convenience, for money, for a safety net, and seldom do people marry for love. In this movie, neither character ever said ""I love you"" or got married, or lived together, or had "" the relationship stages"" that most couples go through. And yet their love was deeper than anything I've ever seen, or known, and most people will ever know. I think Brokeback showed me what it was like to be in love, not because I was in love with them, but if what they felt was anyhting close to the anguish I felt watching it, and even now, then I will know what I am supposed to look for.This movie was life at its truest, purest, and heartbreaking form.",Brokeback Mountain
1375,sunsoulchild,Passion and Love Flow Freely They Are Not Bound By Rules,10,29 May 2006,"Two men with similar lonely and painful backgrounds find themselves alone on a mountain herding sheep. On a freezing night, one man, who is in a tent, invites the other, who is freezing outside, into the tent. No one really knows what causes the heart to love, or the bodies to be physically attracted to others, but this happened to these two men, and the love and attraction were so deep that I felt the would suffer in this world because I knew they would never be able to sustain the beauty and force of their love and passion. I feel such passion has nothing to do with sexes. When someone touches you, man or woman, you will love them, What is so amazing is that realization came to me from the earnestness and force of Ang Lee's direction, and the truth and depth of the actors portrayals. There were few scenes, but each scene was a stone of pain in my heart and in the depth of their love. We knew from the beginning when his father showed him the dead man who had been killed for living with a man that he would die. There was no space in this world for their love. As they said in a begging scene, they were not (as they put it)queers. They were two people who fell in love. Their love was so passionate that they had no control over it when they saw each other. Little by little their lives were destroyed. To me most profound image in the movie was the scene of the opened closet door with the two bloodied shirts and the postcard of Brokeback Mountain tacked next to it. I actually cried at the pain of their lost love. I have seen other of Ang Lee's movies, but for me, this was his bravest effort and as a writer, I applaud him. It surely should have won the Best Picture Award, but we here in America have not reached that level of wisdom yet! Perhaps one day... L. W. D. A Poet and Writer",Brokeback Mountain

1379,kathriNy,So unbelievably beautiful,10,14 August 2006,"It has never happened to me to watch a film a couple of times and to continue NEEDING (painfully) to watch it again and again. This is how I feel about ""Brokeback mountain"". About this extraordinary and overwhelming film. You'll probably think that I'm exaggerating or overreacting. The truth is that I left my heart and my soul in the Brokeback mountain along with Jack (fuckin) Twist and Ennis Del Mar. I can't change it and I'm not capable of reacting differently. I don't even know how it really happened. Was it the enigmatic atmosphere of the Brokeback mountain, the performance of the two so young but BRILLIANT actors, the words or the moments without words and action, all that was hidden beneath the surface and in which I was slowly and deeply sinking... Let my try to explain the unexplainable. Just a few symbolic words to embody my inspiration. And PLEASE, watch the film. So powerful. So painfully penetrating. So original, strange and provocative. Deeply emotional and unbelievably beautiful. I was mesmerized by the characters performed by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, their love for each other ""put a spell on me"". Their acting was too good to be true. They made me SEE and FEEL the love. Not only the passion or sensuality but the extremely strong and pure emotional (and spiritual) connection between them. And also the great depth and intensity of sorrow and solitude. Forget the trivial and ordinary love stories. This film has nothing in common with them. It has nothing in common with MOST films. You can learn from it about the nature of love in such a strange and profound way, also because of the delicate and specific circumstances. Was it possible not to feel envy of this deep and unexplainable relationship? And not to be swept away by it. To be obsessed and absorbed. By the Brokeback mountain, the melancholy, the fate. So much severity and tenderness. Unpredictable and uncontrollable - the powerful nature of LOVE.I know I probably sound too emotional and dramatic. But it's not easy to explain the unexplainable. It is almost impossible. So, forgetting the words try to feel the divine inspiration. Believe me that these are not just superlatives. There IS something really enormous in this film. That stays with you and is not leaving. It is not just unforgettable, it's unforgivable. That I'm not still in the Brokeback mountain with Jack and Ennis and their love. Back to reality? Well, I refuse to accept it. I still refuse to accept it.",Brokeback Mountain

I have spent the last four days since first seeing the movie incredibly jealous of the intense and passionate love between the characters of Jack and Ennis. I have spent the last four days shedding a tear for the casualties of society, feeling whole-heartedly that these were not characters but people whom I feel deeply for. Their story permeates my every waking thought. I cannot even begin to properly describe how beautiful this movie is in every way, shape and form. The actors and actresses are superb and you forget they even are actors. The cinematography is breath taking and the composition of the score added just enough to pull at your heartstrings without taking over the movie. I haven't found my ""Brokeback Mountain"" yet, that place where I am completely free to be who I am, but as all of us are, I'm constantly searching. In the meantime, Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Mountain"" is where I'll go to remember what fear will do to you, why regret is never good and that above all else true and pure love will always prevail.",Brokeback Mountain

That's about all I can say positive about this movie.This movie did well at the box office merely because it was controversial....not because it was good. I thought the story was slow, and the characters were shallow. I really expected some depth and character development from this movie. If you're looking for a movie that has breathtaking scenic shots, then see Brokeback Mountain. However, if you're looking for a film with an engaging story and characters, you're wasting your time with this movie (with the exception of Michelle Williams' character...she was fantastic).This movie definitely did NOT deserve the Oscar.

I watched it on Saturday/last night on my own and have experienced a myriad of emotions since, until this evening when I had to walk down my shoreline and be alone with my thoughts and my dog and some tears......the way they aged the characters was well-done too....so, when Ennis told Jack that he was ""putting the blocks to"" his new barmaid gal and Jack responded that he had taken up with some Ranch Forman's wife (I think he said), had he really taken up with the bearded man who was married to the little blonde talkative lady?? The bearded man had made an overture that night after the dinner club when the two men smoked outside - about going to a cabin to drink some whiskey and fish..........finally: was it Lureen/'s father that had those three men beat Jack to death because they (the former) were onto his bisexual philanderings?? Everything else makes sense to me.....How many of you feel that Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are totally straight in ""real life""? John",Brokeback Mountain

Long after you have finished watching the film, it echoes in your heart and the tragedy lives with you forever.

Never has a film been so true to my heart in the turmoil that comes with falling in love. The first time the two men embraced I wept. This is Titanic for the gay man. A story of star crossed lovers who's epic romance ends in tragidy when one man leaves the other man for his whench wife. The lesbian scene was a little unexpected but appreciated because it fit the over all homoerotic themes. A movie has not moved this much since Twillight: Breaking Dawn - Part 1 (can't wait for part 2). I wish I had a partner as loving and gentle as Jake Gyllenhaal who I could take to the mountains myself.

1391,debbie736,Put it in perspective,9,22 June 2006,"I have two comments on the movie. I thought it was very thought provoking and was a well done movie. It was very sad and I am trying not to sound trite, but it makes me realize how unacceptable this was back in the 1960's. Things have gotten better, but like race relations, we have a long way to go in acceptance of those different than us.My second comment is that I don't see this as a ""Great love story"" as I've heard others claim it to be. If this was an affair between a man and a woman, would we call that a great love story? We would probably call it adultery and condemn the couple. However, this couple did not have the option of dissolving their marriages and publicly becoming a true couple. That is probably why I can grieve for their love without condemning their adultery.I guess I have a third comment: This movie really stayed with me after I saw it. There was a lot of emotion between the two men and I actually forgot I was watching a movie and felt like I was there. I would encourage any adult to watch the movie and keep in mind that just as ""The Color Purple"" wasn't a ""black"" movie, this movie is not a ""gay"" movie.",Brokeback Mountain

Commendations - bold subject matter, anything Jake G. does, magnificent scenery, and Michelle Williams performance. And I liked the music. Drudgery - I spent the first third of the movie waiting for it to start, and the last 2/3 waiting for it to end. Here's the irony - I *LIKE* long, slow movies that let you think for yourself! This one's just long and slow. Heath, stick to the pretty-boy roles. Wow, I have to fill up 10 lines - I guess IMDb doesn't do succinct. So, if it matters, I'm a gay rights activist, which is why I applaud the bold subject matter. I've been a Jake fan since October Sky, and he has yet to disappoint me. I've never been a Heath fan, and he has yet to disappoint me. I've never been a Michelle Williams fan, but she converted me. Am I up to 10 lines yet?",Brokeback Mountain
1393,bbmfanever,The book complements the movie,10,26 June 2006,"First I read the short story and then watched the film, so it is difficult to understand why some people find the first part of the movie slow, it's not. Every second is important to the relationship that starts building between Jack and Ennis from the first time they set eyes on each other outside Aguirre's trailer.Having read the short story first, I immediately understood Ennis nervousness and depression when Jack tells him they have to go back down the mountain. Ennis does not understand his feelings for Jack, he only knows  at that point  that he has never felt so happy before (""feels like he can paw the white out of the moon""). And it takes him one year to figure out that he should never have let Jack out of his sight, meaning that he finally realized what his real feelings for Jack were, but that by then, already married and with a child, it was far far too late.If he had not been married, then MAYBE Ennis could have had a life with Jack. But he had already formed a family, and only had time to ""earn a living"" and was the kind of person that would never abandon a wife and child that depended on him, remember that it is Alma that divorces him. So the only thing left to him was to meet Jack every one in a while in the back of nowhere. The book also makes it clear that Alma divorces him because she gets tired of him going on his fishing trips and never taking a vacation with her and the girls, his refusal to get good permanent jobs and his propensity ignore her in bed.So, even though the film is very powerful, it is even more so after having read the book, don't miss it.And to all who didn't understand Ennis last words, they were: ""Jack, I swear_"" and the author adds: ""though Jack had never asked him to swear anything and was himself not the swearing kind.""",Brokeback Mountain
1394,mcusc777,Good but not great,7,17 July 2006,"Due to the movie's acclaim, I had to watch it for myself. However, CRASH was the best picture of the year, with CAPOTE a close second, and in my humble opinion, M OF A GEISHA a close third. My problem with Bback was with the initial character development and interaction between the boys, preceding their first tryst. It did not seem that there was enough moments where their mutual attraction and feelings were growing, and I believe the first 30 minutes of the film dragged on a bit. I did not believe the level of intensity, which made it hard for me to buy the rush of passion. Nonetheless, the story was good, and I felt the acting was great, with Heath Ledger leading the way.

Yes, I wanted to see it, but after the preview was shown at another movie, I knew it was something I had to see. I saw the movie with my boyfriend, and I was moved and brought to tears.The honesty of the subject matter was written in a way that was non-offensive and showed the public what real love is all about. Although there were parts I'm sure were offensive to some, to me it was shown in a loving and beautiful way. The bond between the two main characters was so real; it made me want to be a part of it and know exactly how these two lives were changed. And I know they were. They shared something special and ended up as lifelong friends.I would personally recommend this movie to anyone  it will change how you view people and situations that are different from what you are used to. I am very comfortable around gay people, having friends and family that are. And this movie only showed me more of the reason why these people should be able to live their lives to the fullest and in anyway they see fit without the discrimination and hatred that the world has for them.Ang Lee - I congratulate you on an honest portrayal through a beautiful film. Keep the great work and bring more like it. I am now a fan for life.",Brokeback Mountain

Of course I am not that way with my friends but to each his own. My point behind this post is to actually say I think this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.

It, along with the few kissing scenes, were some of the most passionate I have ever seen, even among heterosexuals! I wasn't convinced that this movie was about love. Even after the end of the movie, it was apparent that Ennis really enjoyed making love to Jake. There was no dialogue or action that indicated to me that there was an emotional bond between the two men. They really just needed each other sexually.

More importantly he is the best film director in the world to tackle the topic dealing with sensitive human nature. Can you find another director who is more perfect to BBM?  All the cast, especially the four young leading stars came to BBM not for money. They came here to seek serious career breakthrough. They are devoted and have been worked hard. I would be thanking them the same just for their effort if their performance had turned out unimpressive. Lucky us, because they are talented and have great passion for BBM, they have delivered perfect performance and their performance has moved the audience world wide, gay or straight, men or women. I do not want to say their performance is Oscar worthy, you know sometimes Oscar's choice does not really mean anything. From short story to film production, everyone in the BBM team is among the best in the world, more importantly everyone has devoted to deliver his best.

I believe now I have seen real love.,10,21 February 2007,"It is useless to say that it is the best movie I have ever seen. I simply cannot believe that I've seen it just now, that it's been out there for two years. I saw it twice so far, and I cried for three days after seeing it. My head hurt so bad, but the memory of the truly moving love story I saw was too alive in my soul for me to help myself from crying. I saw it with a friend of mine, and she was so surprised I cried. I cannot believe that there are people out there that were not moved by this incredible movie. It's definitely much more than ""gay cowboy movie"" some label it. It is just so sad, it was the only movie that made me cry. After seeing it, I watched different sequences, and each one made my heart shrink. My brain tries desperately to tell my heart that it's just a movie, but it's just the most romantic and the deepest movie. Watching it, I simply forgot that there were two men involved in that story. It just seamed as a hidden relationship, no matter who the two people involved were. I could never have imagined that a love story can be so sad. I have friends that make fun of me for crying over a movie, and especially over a ""gay"" movie. I just don't get them. After seeing this movie I have a totally different conception over what love can be. I can't imagine somebody not being moved by this movie. Maybe not as moved as to be sad and depressed for a week - like I am - but at least to get some of them thinking. Just listening to the soundtrack brings tears to my eyes, because it makes me recall all the happy moments Ennis and Jack had together, and how tragically they had to part. It is truly a wonderful love story, probably the most emotional ever written. No words can describe in how many ways this movie moved me. Great job!

Its the most beautiful enchanting movie i have EVER seen, and I will love it forever. Performances by Jake and Heath were outstanding. They handled the whole thing with integrity and honour and the fact that they were gay was irrelevant, it's a beautiful love story that most people can relate to in some way, whether gay, straight or bisexual. The visuals are stunning, Ang Lee is an amazing director. The scene when jack comes to visit at his house Ennis for the first time after their Brokeback experience and they kiss, it gets me every time, you really feel its real and as I said, everyone can relate to missing someone so much that when you find them again you don't want to let go, even the first love scene which is pretty brutal, well what do you expect form 2 cowboys at this time living in the deep south? As there relationship develops so does the intimacy and tenderness. I very rarely feel compelled to write on these things and I'm not a particularly romantic or slushy kinda girl but Brokeback is one of a kind and I think it can teach people a lot and really make you look at your life and relationships in a different light. yes I know it's just a movie but a frickin amazing one, and if it can make me (a fairly level headed person) go all dewy eyed than it's gotta be something special!!

Thank the powers that be it was in the comfort of my home on a weekend that I first had the pleasure of watching this epic because the more I watched, the more I wanted - even needed, to watch it. And when I wasn't watching it, I was replaying it in my head. It's been a few days and I still can't stop thinking of it. I feel a little ridiculous but for some reason this movie touched such a raw nerve in me that I don't know what to do with myself. It has stirred up my yearning for that deep and electric connection which I fear is not real. I wonder whether it is unattainable not only because it is 'movie' love but also a love only likely of past ages due to the complexities of social influence etc. Can feelings be so strong if there are no obstacles? Would the intensity dissolve with the mundaneness of ordinary life if caution is thrown to the wind and a life is forged together? Despite these fears and although I'm not a religious woman, I pray to taste something so exquisite.Casting was perfect - in total awe of Heath and Jake (and Michelle - jealous too, naturally).

In weird ways, the lover that you never get is the lover you love the most. Such pure love is beyond age, gender, race, nationality and time. Ang Lee, as a Taiwanese director, to direct a movie with so much complex background and timeframe, is magnificent. No wonder Oscar validate the movie as well as the director.

The best stories are always the most basic, the most fundamental. They deal with issues like friendship, trust, courage, endurance. Unlike, say, Lord of the Rings, however, or even like To Kill a Mockingbird, Brokeback Mountain doesn't spell out a moral code in black and white: free people of the West vs. orcs and trolls; tolerance vs. bigotry. Everyone is fully human, with the capacity for joy and sorrow, hope and fear. Everyone tries. Everyone hurts.Take a chance on this movie.

1407,arseno2003,Western Genre Masterpiece Full of Chinese Aesthetics,10,16 August 2006,"""Brokeback Mountain"" is a beautiful, faithful, and moving film-adaptation of Annie Proulx's short story. The film conveys intact and true the overall mood and emotional fullness from Proulx's terse narrative, even though not every scene nor all of the dialogue from the short story has been translated into the film verbatim (although a great majority of the dialogue and description has). This is understandable given the different natures of the two media. Inner psychological reflections and some physical descriptions in the written word can be difficult to portray on film cinematographically in photorealism, or may have been considered too graphic for such an artistic movie. If nothing else, this film is very tastefully done. To fully appreciate the film, one may wish to read and compare the short story, and view it at least two or three times to catch all of the subtleties, beginning from the very first scene. Reflective of their time and social environment, the nonverbal Western (as well as ""Asian"") cultural trait, the characters exhibit a reticence to address controversial or sensitive matters too directly. Hence, the filmmakers employ metaphoric allusions, subtle, nuanced facial and physical expressions or vocal inflections (e.g., an eyebrow raised, a stolen glance, a longing look, or avoidance of eye contact hiding behind hats, a lingering touch, or a pregnant pause) to convey unsaid or unsay-able thoughts or emotions as a projection of repression. Even though unsaid or conveyed indirectly, an observant viewer will understand completely the emotions and feelings that are being communicated.As one viewer's impressions, given that director Ang Lee is Chinese (Taiwan), he imbues throughout the entire film an ""Asian"" or ""Chinese"" aesthetic. For instance, there seems to be a particular framing of the landscape reminiscent of classical Chinese paintings, or incorporation of parallel and complementary scenes as well as so-called ""bookend"" scenes, like Chinese rhyming couplets. Often times when Jack and Ennis are together, every view of the moon is of a full moon, which not only signifies passage of time - usually only one full moon per month - but also in Chinese culture has connotations of wholeness and completeness. Thus, Jack and Ennis symbolically are two halves of a whole - yin and yang. The black and white hats, may actually reflect the yin and yang natures of Jack and Ennis, respectively. One can say that Jack is predominately ""psychologically feminine,"" while Ennis is ""psychologically masculine"".Yin and yang are descriptions of complementary opposites rather than absolutes. Most forces in nature can be broken down into their respective yin and yang states, and the two are usually in movement rather than held in absolute stasis. As in the traditional, circular yin-yang symbol, part of yin is also in yang, and part of yang is in yin, which is symbolized as a dot of each one in the other respectively. The dots in each serves as a reminder that there are always traces of one in the other. For example, there is always light within the dark (e.g., the stars at night); these qualities are never completely one or the other. Also, the dots serve as a reminder that absolute extreme on one part transforms instantly into the opposite, or that the labels yin and yang are conditioned by an observer's point of view. For example, the hardest stone can be easiest to break. This can show that absolute discrimination between the two is artificial.",Brokeback Mountain
1408,callie_seminoles,Simply Astonishing!!,10,4 September 2006,"This movie is unsurprising beautiful! A standing ovation on Ang Lee's behalf! The intensity of the relationship between Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar is never over looked, even with the remarkable landscaping of the mountain, you mind never wonders to anything other then the love between these two men. This is one of the very few movies that truly captures true love and passion. The casting director could not have selected a better cast! It was clear that Heather Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams poured their heart and soul into this film and i applaud them for that. I have watched this movie several times and every time my eyes fill with tears as i watch the incredible story of these men. The remarkable one liner, ""I wish i knew how to quit you."" sends chills down my spine and a tingle in my heart! I have more respect for Ang Lee then any other director in the business today!!",Brokeback Mountain
1409,sarahmurray,"The story of a love that is ""unique yet universal"", and uncommon in its place and time.",10,29 November 2006,"Brokeback Mountain tells a story as old as time, but one that is new to the mainstream. It is heartbreaking; cinematically beautiful; subtle in its messages; and impossible to forget. It offers the possibility of changing minds about love, changing minds about the American west, and changing how people approach their own lives. There is no acting -- only being: the actors become the characters and will be immortalized forever as Jack and Ennis. This film became a classic the moment it hit the theaters, with its tale of two ranch hands and an unarticulated, yet layers-deep, relationship. Fear, violence and oppression are never blatantly or gratuitously offered to the audience, but that energy is always lurking below the surface, as the friendship unfolds over a course of 20 years, leaving marriages and children in its wake. The true casualty here is the viewer's emotions, which are taken on a battering ride up and down a mountainous journey toward realizing love.",Brokeback Mountain
1410,pauldarby,"Been there, done that--and I'm glad I did",10,30 July 2006,"Since I bought the DVD a month or so ago, I knew I would be commenting here, where I have read SO MANY fantastic reviews of Brokeback Mountain. I hope more people will comment since the DVD was released.I can't get interested in most of the movies out there, but BBM attracted me right away. I had no idea that it is a virtual template of my life. I was in my early 20s in 1963, the time frame of BBM, and, like Ennis and Jack, I also never heard the word ""gay."" But I knew what homosexuality was because I heard about it in church. The prospect of visiting hell was terrifying from an early age on, so imagine my shock while aboard ship one evening in the Navy--I froze, turned numb, couldn't breathe--and couldn't stop--when the handsomest, most virile shipmate in our division ""put the make"" on me. I succumbed instantly. And so began THAT relationship, my first. Like Jack Twist, I would have risked discovery and all the penalties of hell (which I gave up believing not long after) if this guy and I could continue on. Alas, it was not to be. After our tours of duty, we went our separate ways.When I watched Heath and Jake play Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist in such an incredibly realistic and honest manner, all my memories of past ""indiscretions"" passed before my mind's eye. I quickly felt bonded to both Ennis and Jack, because I had played both their parts. Although I shouldn't have, I also married, had children and now 40 years later, still married, I think Ennis was right in being practical but wrong if he ever thought he would/could fulfill his love for Jack without feeling damned sorry, especially after Jack was killed, gone for good. I was convinced after the 2nd tent love scene that Ennis really did love Jack early on, which was re-emphasized toward the end of the film with Jack's flashback to when they were herding sheep on Brokeback. That's when Ennis said, ""You'll scare the sheep off again if you don't stop playing that harmonica."" He looked over his shoulder at Jack, smiling tenderly, the same way he did in the flashback. It was a look of intimacy they'd had between them, of a love deeply shared. I was sure later on that Ennis was still in love with Jack, even after marriage and kids, because missing Jack had been eating away at him since the two parted. Even then, considering that era, Ennis would not have thought he was pursuing a ""gay romance"" but simply trying to fill an empty hole in his heart. The great ""reunion"" kiss after four years should be seen frame by frame. If THAT is acting--well, this has to be one reason BBM is thought to be a ""breakthrough"" film if only because Heath and Jake were so convincing. And the kiss really mattered in the story line. I can imagine Ennis thinking, ""Sorry, Alma. Don't mean to hurt you; however Jack is my true love--but we can still have a family and I won't embarrass you in public.""Of course Ennis is the ultimate loser between him and Jack, but he knew while Jack did not, his belief that, ""Two men living together, no way"" would eventually doom their secret affair, but only if Jack put a stop to it. Jack did in their final crucial scene together, and it was Ennis who was devastated by it. Jack's look was of disappointed despair as he watched Ennis drive away. The following ""pie scene"" must have been the epilogue to Ennis' collapse in Jack's arms. Ennis' face is stiff and flushed, and his eyes wet, when he looks up at Cassie. He isn't apologizing to her; she's an intruder on his life and thoughts. Besides, he is totally miserable, and soon to be more so after Jack is killed, who then makes the discovery of the two shirts in Jack's closet. In the end, he knows that Jack did love him; I think he was sorry that Jack didn't understand Ennis' depth of love for him in return.These final scenes, so masterfully done by both Heath, Jake and cast, will, I hope, make BBM a timeless classic. This movie reminds me that some things you only live once, mainly when you are young. Now that I am 68, I can look back on a lot and not feel sorry for those sometimes short, and risky, love affairs I had that made me shiver and shake, while also refusing to believe they were homosexual at all. Instead, helplessly, I think, they were an unstoppable force of nature that is impossible to control. What else could be more human? If presented the same opportunity today, I'm sure I would react the same.For me, Brokeback Mountain is the finest expression of cinema I don't expect to see again in my lifetime. Many thanks to all who made it.",Brokeback Mountain
1411,mohua_13,A devastatingly subtle tragic love....,10,30 August 2006,"The pendulum finally swings the other way in Hollywood, thanks to Ang Lee's fine direction. Subtlety and sobriety encompasses this tragic love between two humans unravelling at a dawn in 1963 and ending in darkness 20 years later. Beautifully canvassed allowing the actors to give their finest performances so far, each one of them. Jake more than Heath traverses his character transformation from naive vitality to anguished disappointment with such a nuanced performance. Brokeback certainly got *us* film lovers good..How the balance (white and black hats that complement each other, yin and yang) between Ennis and Jack moves from the former's dominance to the latter's slowly taking charge and after the final heated argument, letting go after 20 years... his father admitting that another ranch neighbour had replaced Jack's 'dream of settling in the ranch' with Ennis. Watch Ennis's facial expression change from a light self-satisfied smile to his nostrils flaring slightly in shock at the words as he had always assumed Jack's love for him as a given. Jack was able to negotiate with his strict uncaring father about his dreams but in contrast Ennis was unable to come to an understanding of his own emotions even with himself. And then his discovery of the 2 shirts which finally drives the point home of Jack's constant love and Ennis' loss. Poignancy at its best.I believe this film requires several revisits to fully comprehend the nuanced performances and storytelling. Ennis silently debating with himself at the fire before entering the tent the second night and giving in wholly and his unarticulated sadness at leaving the mountains; his eager impatience at Jack's impending visit after a 4-year hiatus and probably the only time when his emotions take over his stoic demeanour (shocking Jack too) and after their final meeting the screen completely blacks out signifying darkness / night / doom. And then the story moves to a different plane of a poignant loss.I wish to thank the entire cast and crew - each one of them - of this beautiful emotional film for their sincerity since I don't think the motive was money (let us forget Randy Quaid here) and their dedication is apparent in every frame for making this devastatingly simple story that lingers forever and forever.... even in India so far away from rural Americana.",Brokeback Mountain

It was as if I'd suffered an emotional nuclear blast. At the same time, if I'd read Annie Proulx's short story before seeing the movie, I may not have gone into a theater, knowing how the movie would have exposed me. Therefore, I would have waited to see it on DVD, which for me, did not have the same affect. I'm glad I didn't know anything about Brokeback Mountain; even the suffering it caused me in those painful viewings. Because of that unbearable pain, is why I feel it took me and held me upside down by my feet and shook the hell out of me.It has now been more then 2 years since I first saw this movie and its effect is still felt strongly.

Those scenes have haunted my sleep, interrupting my dreams. I feel differently, not about anything particular, but physically and emotionally, I feel changed. The love between them is the type of love that crosses borders. In no way was I disgusted, nor did I ever view their love as homosexual.

I found the movie very confronting, moving, and quite personal. The story is exceptionally well framed. The movie is admirably directed and beautifully filmed. The lead roles, particularly Heath Ledger & Jake Gyllenhaal are superbly acted. Well done all involved!!! I grew up in the period when the movie begins, a teenager of the sixties, knowing I was ""different"", that I felt differently to my mates and family and trying to come to terms with those differences and rationalise them with a reasonably religious upbringing was a long and difficult road to follow. Falling madly and permanently in love with a 'best mate', knowing that could never go anywhere was a bitter, confusing and frustrating emotional time. As you get older it is put into a clearer perspective, no less painful, but clearer. You still love, but life must move on. I thank all concerned in the writing and making of this story for telling a tale of true love, against the odds. I'm sure that it touched a personal and private place in many hearts. A special thanks to Heath & Jake for showing their bravery portraying the main characters in such a genuine and deeply moving manner. Thanks again.

I had read the set of Annie Proulx's short stories months before the movie came out so I knew the storyline and was familiar with the characters. Nonetheless, I was not prepared for what awaited me. I will never forget how I felt after viewing BBM for the first time in a cinema last January. I was floored, crushed, speechless. I was in a state of emotional shock. I returned to the theater about 10 days later to see it again and the emotional impact was even stronger. I could not hold back my tears and was sobbing as I was returning home. I was haunted by the images of Ennis, alone in his small run-down trailer, and in Jack's room. These were exceptionally powerful scenes with very few words uttered, if any.I think this is the perfect film: the pace is controlled and reproduces perfectly the feelings of waiting, hoping and longing for two long decades. The treatment is so ""true"", and nothing in this film is artificial or contrived. The actors are just exceptional and give unforgettable performances. Brokeback Mountain simply tells a story. It's neither moralizing nor preachy. It tells a very moving love story and touches our hearts like no other film. I saw this movie 9 months ago and I am still haunted and affected by it.

I honestly cannot understand what all the fuss is about. Actually, I can understand the fuss. It deals with ewwww say it quietly *gayness* -How original! How fabulous! Simply Shocking! Don't get me wrong, this movie has a few things going for it- such as its famous director, pretty scenery, and shock value. But that's where the merits of this disaster end. For starters, I really fail to see when and wear Ang Lee cultivated any notion of a deep, pristine, true love with this couple. Maybe it was my inability to understand a damn word they were saying... perhaps their intense ""love"" for one another was lost on me in translation. People sing the praises of this amazing love. Where was it? I never saw such a thing. Secondly, people feel so sorrrrrrrry for these guys. Oh poor Jack, poor Ennis. Make me barf. You have to be kidding me. Two poor loving cowboys who just can't be together?!?! What a load of crap. Let's talk about their poor innocent families, that were destroyed by two lousy selfish good for nothing liars. Let's talk about how they were both crappy fathers and failures for husbands. I will say that at least Ennis attempted the right thing, paying child support and putting visits with his daughters before his trite little affair with Jack. Jack, whose moral fabric consists of wrecking homes and shacking up with prostitutes. Jack who is basically lucky to get killed before the 80s got ahold of him. I digress. Let me switch gears for a second and point out what is positive about Brokeback Mountain. This film does a FANTASTIC job of representing everything that is wrong with America. It succeeds in glorifying selfishness, while wrapping up dishonesty, adultery and betrayal in a neat little package and delivering it to an all-to-adoring audience so concerned with being politically correct that they just soak it up, believing this to be acceptable behavior. Where is the accountability? Not on Brokeback Mountain, that's for sure. I am saddened by this movie. But not because of some life-changing, mind blowing love gone awry.

1431,pookie1168,pure love and romance,10,3 November 2006,"I admit I didn't want to see the movie, because of the content. I didn't quite understand what it was all about. I heard negativity about it. I gave in and watched with my eyes glued to the screen. I have never been so moved by a drama movie. I had every emotion running through me. I cried, laughed, got mad. I felt the love and hurt deep down.I just have to say that this the best movie that I have seen in a long time. I watched it again the next day. Beautiful actors, Beautiful story. Wonderful decision for the chosen actors, the did an amazing job. This will be at the top of my movie list for years to come. Bravo. This movie taught me a lesson on just how powerful love can be.",Brokeback Mountain
1432,blueoleander14,Not worth your while,5,3 November 2006,"Good lord. After highly anticipating this movie and finally getting the chance to see it, I was highly disappointed by Brokeback Mountain. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, actors i normally love, were disappointing. They mumbled and the dialogue itself was lacking. Most of the film consisted of long landscape scenes and, if you are not overly homophobic and have problems with two men snogging (which is about as graphic as Sean William Scott and Ashton Kutcher in Dude, Where's My Car) then the film is dull and monotonous. If you are looking for steamy gay sex you will not find it here. Unless i'm just corrupted, which is entirely possible. I suggest that you spend your time on the actual Oscar Winner for Best Picture in 2006- Crash. That film is thought provoking and emotionally moving.",Brokeback Mountain

1434,M_Anne,Overrated,6,31 December 2006,"I saw Brokeback Mountain and it was a good film. The acting was amazing and the story line was important, but the writing and the directing were overrated. Some scenes which were supposed to be touching were funny because the directing was awkward. The writing was cheesy, and could have been better. All in all, the film was good, but it was overrated. Still, it is worth seeing at least once because it is a film which will hopefully help the gay rights movement progress for the better. If you see the film you won't loose anything, but if you don't you won't loose anything if you are already for gay rights but if you are not then you should see it because it might give you a new perspective.",Brokeback Mountain
1435,mafias,An Exceptional Piece of Art,10,14 November 2006,"Despite all the negative comments out there (each person has their opinion, of course), this film was an amazing experience. One of the best films I've ever seen (and by 'best' I mean the most touching).The cast performed wonderfully and courageously well, the drama was intense, and the story was moving. This film really manages to get most people, whatever their sexual preferences are. To most people (including me), the tears are impossible to avoid at certain scenes, and not every film can do this.This is a true representation of our current society, its hatred against people's sexual preferences, and its despite for their the ones that actually suffer deeply inside. I didn't need to see this film to change my mind about this subject, but it intensified my thoughts, making me a better and more understanding person with other human beings.As the film's slogan says, Love is a Force of Nature, and that is a fact. The main reason people NEED to have a relation with the opposite sex, is that so it will be possible to have children of their own. Excluding that, everyone can (and should) love whoever they want no one should (and can) judge them for who they love. This film has made its point, and I truly believed in their love for each other. I believe that at some point, everyone will be able to understand this matter, and everyone that still opposes or thinks this this is a big joke are the ones that will be rejected in the future. So, every person that already accepts the natural way of how love works, is one step ahead of the ones that don't, and they're certainly more human for that.I recommend watching this film, and please don't comment it unless you've actually watched it.",Brokeback Mountain
1436,adbabin,Brokeback Mountain,10,16 November 2006,"Finally got to watch the 'Brokeback Mountain' movie on DVD, and I have found it to be one of the most inspiring love stories - especially gay love stories. I have already watched it two times and plan to watch it some more! Heath and Jake did a very great job portraying these characters of Ennis and Jack. I strongly encourage that everyone watch the movie, and I hope that it will help whoever looks down on gay love relationship realize that there are many different kinds of love for everyone in all aspects. Gay love relationship should not be considered as a taboo, but as a pure love beyond imagination. The movie made me think of how gay life must be like in the early 1960's and how it has changed in the last 40 years. More and more societies are starting to accept gay love relationship, and I am sure this movie will make everyone think. Ang Lee did a superb job making this movie, and I hope he and other directors will make more movies like this one in the years to come.",Brokeback Mountain

You would never know it came out in 2005.. it holds up better than any movie I have ever seen. But more importantly, on the cusp of turning 30 years old and having experienced love and loss since my first experience watching it, Brokeback Mountain and the acting, cinematography, directing ... all of it, profoundly impacted me.It's a movie about the human experience and how amazing yet harrowing love can be AND that love knows no bounds. Ugh this movie is beautiful and devastating all wrapped into one. It deserves every award it was nominated for and those it lost. Heath Ledger was simply perfection in his role as Ennis. Like another user review said, Heath was not there in the character at all...Heath became Ennis from the first scene.I cannot stop thinking about this movie. It was incredible and like my title, I would give it 11 out of 10 stars if I could. Everyone should see this movie. It will change you. It has changed me.",Brokeback Mountain
1438,x-Rebecca,Brokeback mountain: The movie in general,10,16 October 2007,"Although I found myself almost wanting to fast-forward through the fudge packing bits, I found that the movie was definitely heart-felt and a must-see. The main attraction was The Combination of Good Actors, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal who may I add are mighty fine.. Before I go off on a random tangent about how ""Buff-tang"" they are I will give you ten good reasons as to why you should see the movie:It's a love story (awwwwwww everyone love's a bit of Romance right?)It's got a tragic ending (Ok well I guess I made it damn obvious one of them's gonna die.)It's great wanking material for Gay people.Nice pleasant scenery, (I don't mean Heath and Jake) Canadian Rockies of Alberta I think it was filmed in. If you like sheep it's got tons of those in it... Well acted- that always helps. It won loads of awards from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, Golden Globe Awards, Critics Choice Awards, and Independent Spirit Awards etc, etc. *Yawn*... It's sad, If you like being depressed for days after watching it then it's definitely a winner. Oh, but if you're already depressed then don't watch it because then you'll be suicidal. If you buy the DVD then you get a great picture on the front. It basically consists of Gay men in Cowboy hats on a Mountain supposedly fishing when actually they're cheating on their wives. What more could you want in a film?Bad points of the film- Well I could hardly say it's a family film, Imagine the awkwardness of watching the movie with your Grandma in the room, Imagine all the embarrassing stuff she'd say?I gave it 9 out of 10 because of its originality. Yes. I'm generous.",Brokeback Mountain
1439,luvforall,"laugh, cry, hurt, hate, love",10,28 November 2006,"I'm going to make this short and sweet. Brokeback Mountain is one of the most moving movies I have seen. I started the movie off because I was bored and I was not supposed to be watching it (or anything) for another week. But as it went on I noticed I picked it up for a reason, I related to it (not exactly) but pretty close. It hit me like a bullet, i was left crying in a ball at the foot of my chair at the end of the movie saying to myself ""Why did that have to happen?"" I sobbed for about an hour and could not get to sleep that night. There is no way I will look at pure, perfect love ever again. It doesn't matter whether it is between two guys, two girls, or a guy and a girl, it is still a love that rattles you deep into your bones and never, ever lets you forget it. That's what BBM is about, not ""the gay cowboy movie"" but a story of unconditional love.",Brokeback Mountain

Then the movie hit me, I went into a state of hock for days and slowly was able to return to normal life. Never in my life has a movie had that affect on me, to this day months after 1st seeing I'm afraid it may floor me yet again.Greatness is usually seen in ones actions. Well if that holds true for movies just look at all it has done, its awards the movements in has begun.

1441,craigconners,Too many unanswered questions,9,5 December 2006,"This film has many excellent aspects, such as great actors (Ledger and Gyllenhaal) and actresses (Williams and Hathaway nearly steal the show) and breathtaking scenery, yet too many questions were unanswered.First, in the beginning of the film, the viewer notices that Jack could possibly be gay. For example, while shaving in the side view mirror of his old pick-up truck while waiting for the employer to show up, Jack is also eyeballing the quiet handsome cowboy, Ennis (although we do not yet know his name).In addition, once Jack and Ennis are on the mountain, Jack is staring at Ennis (who was hunched down nude cleaning himself at the campsite) and gingerly wiped Ennis' scraped head (which occurred when his horse was spooked by the bear).Hence, while it is clear that Jack is at least interested in Ennis from the beginning, we do not know whether the feeling is mutual from Ennis' perspective. Is it possible that Ennis would never have engaged in a gay relationship had he not been in virtual seclusion in a desolate mountain with another young man? After all, throughout the film, it is apparent that Ennis is capable of remaining loyal to either his wife or Jack, although Jack is incapable of fidelity to his wife and buddy Ennis (for example, Jack engages in relationships with the Mexican male prostitute and his bearded married coworker in Texas; the one who mentioned going to a cabin alone with Jack during the dinner date with their wives).Second, while Alma Del Mar's reaction of shock and dismay (upon seeing her husband frantically kissing another man) was quite convincing, I do not understand why she did not immediately confront Ennis and Jack. In my view, most women (even those of the 1960s, who were more domestic and subservient to their husbands than their modern counterparts) would have minimally thrown Jack out of the family home. In addition, I was bewildered by Ennis' carelessness (i.e., when he saw Jack 3 to 4 years later, why couldn't he hug his buddy and whisper, ""Wait until I get you alone later?"". Alma would not have been suspicious had he been careful).Third, since Ennis is clearly experiencing financial issues in Wyoming, why didn't Jack offer him a job with him in Texas? It would have been a very convenient way for the 2 men to live within close proximity of each other, and business would have been a legitimate reason for them to be together, and no one would have been the wiser. Phony fishing trips (and then returning home without any fish) would not have been necessary.Fourth, how did Jack die? During the telephone scene (where Ennis is speaking with Jack's wife Laureen), Laureen explains that Jack died while ""changing a tire"" and ""was crushed to death at the age of 39"". During Laureen's explanation, the viewer briefly sees Jack being attacked and brutally kicked in the groin and beaten and hit with a tire iron by three men. It seemed obvious to me that Laureen was callous and not the least bit saddened by her husband's death. In my view, Laureen's demeanor during the phone call with Ennis said, ""That fu**ing qu**r got what he deserved, but this is my story and I'm sticking to it"". Also, I thought Laureen utilized an intentional ""pun"" when she told Ennis, ""Jack never did write his friends' addresses and phone numbers down; he kept them in his HEAD"" (i.e., the primary interaction that occurred with these FRIENDS?). Therefore, Laureen most likely discovered her husband's sexuality, and had him murdered.Fifth, if you watch this movie only once, the item that Ennis is carrying out of Jack's parents' house is vague and confusing. After watching the film again, it was then clear Ennis was taking his shirt back over 2 decades later (i.e., while horseplaying with Ennis during the end of their Summer together in 1963, Jack causes Ennis' nose to bleed; Jack keeps the shirt as a souvenir).Sixth, after Ennis has a toast of congratulations with his daughter on her recent engagement and sends her off, Ennis' final words ""Jack, I swear"" are chilling, sad, and possibly vague. Nevertheless, I understood them to have meaning on multiple levels, such as ""I wish we could have had that ranch together as you'd suggested"", ""I love you, Jack"" (remember, Ennis just asked his daughter whether her soon to be husband loved her), and ""I wish I knew how to quit you"" (repeating Jack's words).Hollywood loves sequels; I would not be surprised to see ""Return to Brokeback Mountain"" in the horizon. Will Ennis return to Jack's parents' ranch as promised? Will we see Alma Jr.'s wedding? Will Alma, Sr. and Laureen finally age a little? Will Jack's murderers be charged with a hate crime, and brought to justice? Will Ennis' financial difficulties eventually be resolved? Is Ennis doomed to loneliness in his empty, run down trailer in the middle of nowhere? With Jack dead, who will be Ennis' new ""buddy""? This movie had the saddest ending I've ever seen in a movie; I was very depressed after viewing this film.I highly recommend it to movie lovers. This is NOT a gay cowboy movie. In this age of hate, tolerance is paramount. Anger should be directed towards the child molesters, not consenting adults.",Brokeback Mountain

1443,zachwindhamil,That was stupid,1,23 January 2007,I dongt get it what makes it good? Just because they are gay? In the story they get married and have kids and then cheat on their wifes to be with each other and destroy their families and then one of the gay guys cheats on his original gay lover. that was basically the real movie plot a bunch of people cheating on each other and destroying each ther's lifes. if people want to make a gay movie that's fine. But that movie didn't make sense in the fact that it is supposed to be a heartwarming gay people triumphing over evil movie. I mean the academy loved it but they put movies i've never even heard of as best picture nominees.,Brokeback Mountain
1444,ggfura,Overwhelmingly emotional,9,11 December 2006,"I've always been the type of person to feel embarrassed or awkward for a character in a movie and can't bear to watch that particular scene in its entirety. There are awkward moments because some of the scenes are very raw and bold. I for one felt that it was quite necessary in order to capture an audience's attention. You sense a sudden jolt that tells you something powerful will happen. It opens your eyes to a broader spectrum of love and what it would, should, might or even is meaning to someone. There is no secret that this movie is about a secret love affair between 2 married men. What I was surprised to see was the very emotional draw between Ennis & Jack (an I'm not talking about the kissing). What an effort it must have been for the two actors to accomplish those scenes. After awhile you start to feel like they're two teenagers so in love that they've lost absolute control. I think that's why I felt very heart-broken for them. I found myself hoping that they would end up together in the end. Whether one believes that it's right or wrong, I felt that I needed to view it with complete respect for not only the characters in the story, but for those who struggle with the same heartaches in life. In the end, everyone wants and needs love in their life to feel that they've lived. That's how I felt after watching this movie.",Brokeback Mountain
1445,aanimapedia,One of the movies about homossexuality with one of the most terrible and uncomfortable execution i ever seem,1,28 September 2021,"I don't understand the reason why this movie is so praised, it's unnecessarily long, boring, poorly written and relies very hard on Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger's acting, which by the way, they tried. The overall sensation this movie gives is uncomfortable, everything the movie does is because the plot needs it to fulfill its 2 hours and 45 minutes and does absolutely nothing with itAfter the first act, the movie has no story to tell, it's just subplot over subplot and none of them is solved, it's embarrassing to watch. The ending is not worth the praise or emotion impact people make it seem, they make it look like it's sad and depressing but before all that, there was a lot of pointless unsolved plots that are just forgotten and never touched again and info dumping the audience about something that comes out of nowhere and very near to the ending it really looks like lazy writtingThe worst part is seeing this movie being praised as if it's one of the greatest movies about queer relationships when it really doesn't deserve it, when Jack and Ennis start meeting each other again, it has this unintentional homophobic/biphobic aura coming from the main characters, they cheat on their wives, can't keep a relationship, everything when they are together is sexualized/has some sexual thing to do. Jack and Enis have no dynamic as a couple, they are oversexualized, they don't bond and the movie don't give nothing to develop their relationship to do, they just repeat the same things over and over again, also, are you telling me that these two strangers who know each other for only a few weeks and almost none interaction aside of the lunchbreaks started loving each other because they had, a very disturbing, uncomfortable, almost rape-like, sex in a tent ? If is like this, they didn't fell in love, they fell in lustThe ending is even worse, it's a reflection of what straight people think about queer relationships, they either die or end up in deep depression, not alowed to live a happy life and keeping themselves in the closet forever full of misery and angst. This is not a movie that understands how queer relationships work, it's just another movie that portrays homossexuality as misery and shameful, repeating and reforcing a toxic cycle and trope amongst the LGBTQ+ community that if is not criticized it will continue to happen more and worst than the last time.",Brokeback Mountain
1446,maddiekins,Hauntingly brilliant,10,17 December 2006,"I did something that probably isn't advisable - I watched this alone, late at night. I ended up sobbing into my pillow. It is that good. I had wanted to see this when it came out in the cinema, but I didn't have time. So I finally rented the movie and watched it. And oh my God, it was powerful. The most poignant moments were: Ennis and Jack's first kiss, the reunion (which, by the way, is one of the most moving things I have seen on screen), the moment Ennis realises how Jack died, when Ennis finds the shirt, and the very last line. ""Jack, I swear..."" We are left with that. We are left to wonder what the last part of that sentence is. I swear I never stopped loving you? I swear we'll be together someday? I swear I would have shared my life with you if I could? Perhaps it is best we are left without an ending, because all the sentiments anyone can imagine Ennis wanting to say are expressed in those three words. Their love is so pure, and, in some ways, so unexpressed between them, that your heart aches for their plight. And we are given no reassurance at the end, no feeling that everything will be all right, that they will be together somehow... nothing. Yet the whole film screams this message at us throughout - love will endure.",Brokeback Mountain

Was it because Lureen found about Ennis? Was it because Lureen's family found out he was going to leave Lureen?

For those who have seen it, and loved it as much as i do, i recommend that we keep the story alive, and get others to do the same.

Lots of concentration on the minute and the things that aren't said.Both Jake and Heath are fantastic in it. Quite surprising really. With Jake you think you'll find it hard to shake the his previous iconic roles, well specifically Donnie Darko. But he moves completely beyond that.

1454,joshhayko,The best film of the year.,9,16 March 2006,"When the end of the year rolled around, and I had seen all of the films that had been given high critical acclaim, Brokeback Mountain was my choice for the best film of the year. I am not homosexual and I didn't choose it because I cared about the ""so-called"" agenda that was here. I chose this film because I was very sincerely moved by the story it presented. People who cannot pursue their desires of love without being rejected or persecuted by society. This is a reoccurring theme in the films of Ang Lee (Sense and Sensibility & Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon). I happen to be a very devoted Christian and I would like to say that it an unavoidable fact that many people hypocritically call themselves Christians, while at the same time are guilty of using the church as a way of masking their contempt or often hatred for homosexuals (this is a very strong example of the devil hiding behind the cross). Christ called his followers to love all people unconditionally, and the hatred displayed toward homosexuals by many people in the church is a violation of the instructions of Christ. In my opinion, these hypocrites are securing a greater eternal punishment for themselves than the people who they hate so much. Satan comes in many forms, often in the form of a devoted follower of Christ himself, and people who are aware should be on the watch for these types. My favorite scene and the one that definitely made it the best film of the year for me, was the final scene between Ennis and his daughter. This moment brought tears to my eyes. I likened it to the final scene of Fellini's ""La Dolce Vita"" or Sam Mendes ""American Beauty"" when we the audience are brought to a moment of complete understanding about the main character. That is my favorite scene of the year in film. I am a very big fan of Roger Ebert. I think that he gives very clear and insightful reviews of films, but I must disagree with him on his choice for ""Crash"" for the best film of the year. Paul Haggis is a strong new talent in the industry (espescially after his screenplay last year for million dollar baby). Crash was a good film but I thought even ""King Kong"" was better and ""Munich"" was even more brave.",Brokeback Mountain

Several months ago I saw that it was on and recorded it on TiVo, but still did not watch it until a few days ago. What a mistake that was! The movie was a beautiful story of ""forbidden"" love. It made me both happy and sad. I cannot get the story or the characters out of my mind. I went out and bought the DVD and have watched the movie again. I am fighting the urge to watch it a third time because I don't want it to become some crazy obsession.This movie has made me rethink everything in my life. I don't want to take anything for granted because you never know when it might end. Every single person should watch this movie with an open mind. I have a new respect for the acting talents of Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger. They made a story that seemed improbable to me very believable. I wanted Jack and Ennis to be together so much it hurt my soul. I play out scenarios in my mind where Jack doesn't die, but they continue their relationship to a time when attitudes are different and more accepting and they can be together.

I've seen it in my native language and in its original language with and without subtitles and I have to admit that the Italian version (I don't know the other ones), even if well dubbed, can't do Heath Ledger's role justice cause you can't hear his ""great"" articulate! But I loved so much Jake Gyllenhall performance, just a bit more than Heath Ledger's. His dreamy eyes are something very touching and really take you away! I'm so happy that Brokeback Mountain won in Europe (best movie at Venice Film Festival and BAFTA Awards) but so unhappy that it wasn't given the Oscar. If even in a catholic country like Italy they weren't afraid to vote Brokeback Mountain the best movie just like it deserved why the so open-minded USA didn't do it?",Brokeback Mountain
1459,PaRaDoXiCaL_cOnUnDrUm,Powerful,10,15 April 2007,"Powerful. That's the adjective that I can use best to describe this movie. It isn't afraid to show you the truth...no matter how ugly that truth is. When I watched this film, I expected it to be OK, maybe even a ""pretty good movie."" I've never cried in a movie, and I didn't intend to start now. However, I never thought that days after seeing it, I would still weep at the thought of what happened; I'd feel the pain so far down in my heart that I couldn't describe it to anybody. It's applicable to real life, here and now. To me, it wasn't just some story about two cowboys, but it was something that told us the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth about that time as well as now.This is more than just a ""gay cowboy movie"" that people try to rationalize. Those that berate it are afraid to think about what it truly means. It's much easier to simply call Brokeback Mountain the ""gay cowboy movie"" than to think about what it is truly about. Love. There are many that are unwilling to support those that are different than they are because they are afraid. This movie took on homophobia and challenged it's morality. However, those inflicted with homophobia simply revolted by refusing to think about it because, if they did, they would realize that Brokeback Mountain was something that cannot be denied forever. Heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, transsexual, whatever you are, this show told us how we are all people, no matter the minute differences that cloud our judgment from time to time.They kill Jack Twist in the end. He was beaten by a group of people afraid to accept him. To those that find homosexuality to be so perverse and immoral, how moral is it to murder those that are different? What happened to ""love your neighbor""? We are all people. We have a head, a brain, a stomach, a heart. We all have our own souls and our own pains. Brokeback Mountain tried to show the world that we are all really one. But the world fought back with cowardice and refusal to listen to the truth because they were afraid. Just like Alma was afraid of what Jack Twist represented, many in the world are afraid of what Brokeback Mountain represents. But they are misled, This has nothing to do with gay men, straight men, or blue men for that matter. It has everything to do with love.We are all one in the long run. Composed of nearly identical DNA, all with similar emotions and thoughts, yet there are those that pick apart differences such as homosexuality because that's the only way that they can differentiate themselves from others. But it's not worth it. That's what this film tried to tell us. Hatred is the perversion. Not love. Brokeback Mountain was about, above all else, love. Love...and what happens when people are afraid of love.",Brokeback Mountain

1461,wistfulromeo,A simple yet beautiful story of love and Romance,10,28 December 2005,"When i walked into the theatre To see Brokeback mountain, I was excited and intrigued by the story. I didn't know what to expect, and I certainly wasn't sure how Ang Lee was going to stay true to the short story that inspired this movie.What I found was a beautiful story that unfolds right before your eyes. It's that simple, there are no theatrics, no special effects and no out there plots that leave you shaking your head. There was just a simple love story wrought with complications and real issues. I wasn't even thinking about the fact that this was a same sex relationship. All I saw were two people who shared a love that just would not quit.unfortunately I didn't get to see the end of this beautiful film. The power went out in the movie theatre, and so for the moment I am left to wonder if these two lovers are ever able to come together.I think Ang Lee, Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhal and Michelle Williams deserve major kudos for what they have accomplished here. I think I can safely say there will never be another movie like Brokeback Mountain.",Brokeback Mountain

By far the best movie of 2005, possibly the best I've ever seen.See this movie. Don't make assumptions that you know what it's about from what you've seen in the media. It's a universal, transcendent story that cannot fail to move anyone with a heart.Heath Ledger is astounding as the silent, repressed Ennis Del Mar, beyond any performance you could imagine was in him if you considered only the lightweight fluff that constitutes most of his pre-BBM resume. Jake Gyllenhaal is his perfect dramatic counterpart as the questing, energetic Jack Twist. Their story will linger with you for years.",Brokeback Mountain
1463,aljohnpa,Gay agenda what exactly does that mean?,10,17 January 2006,"Both my parents were Pentecostal ministers. My father was gay and my mother's mission in life was to save/change him. At one point around the age of 14 or 15 I babysat for my father's boyfriend's son. My father died a deeply depressed, broken unfulfilled man still blaming my mother for protecting me from him and preventing our relationship. The marriage was what they thought God wanted a marriage of duty not love. I came out to my parents at 18. My father knew I was gay but never sat and talked honestly with me about his situation. Around the age of 26 I became depressed and my mother swooped in hoping to succeed where she had failed with my father and talked me into entering a (teen challenge) sponsored program that claimed they could change gay men. For one year I worked hard, did as I was told, read or viewed nothing from the outside, memorized scripture, abstained from sex of any kind, fasted for 11 days while cooking for 16 people and prayed. After one year they told me I was changed and released me into the world. I was being encouraged to marry a girl from my parent's church but no one asked if we were in love. After a few months of honest reflection I ended the relationship and went on my way to live my life as intended.Gay people are accused of having an agenda. Just read the above and tell me honestly who really has the agenda. The gay agenda is to end the lies, hate, bondage, brutality and destruction.I went to see Brokeback Mountain last weekend. At first I was stunned then overwhelmed with sadness as I saw my father's life decisions repeated in front of the world. The sadness turned to empathy and understanding of the terrible anguish my father went through trying to change. My thoughts then turned to my mother's pain caused by her misguided mission of beating her head against the stone wall of my father's orientation. Again the sadness set in as I realized what a destructive force this misguided agenda to suppress gays is to entire families. Then I felt something lift from me realizing that so many people would see the destructive forces at play in or society. The rug is being lifted and the dirt of silence and oppression underneath is being exposed. There was a time when mixed race love was treated the same way. Thank you E. Annie Proulx, Ang Lee and all those with the courage to be involved with this project. Thank you for exposing the truth and wreckage.I am 52 now and have been in love with and living with the same man for 27 years. There are many things the laws and lack of equal rights deny us but nothing can keep us from loving each other. Jack Twist was right It is possible to be gay, in love and happy.",Brokeback Mountain
1464,OceanWave-x,boring boring boring,2,19 May 2008,"Not quite awful but we sat through it waiting for the reasons why it won so many prizes.....perhaps Americans are surprised at the reality of gay love....we had Oscar Wilde and Dorian Gray - he did the whole thing much better and that was 100 years ago! Nice Sheep tho!Perhaps it is purely and simply in a world of drab americanisation that any two people who have a relationship not based on guns, toys and special effects is seen as so special that it deserves Oscars. In the real world (Europeans like Almodovar etc) I feel this film would be reduced to the tawdry tat category and rapidly forgotten.I really did like the sheep tho! I can imagine in Wales the film would have been a huge success and perhaps, New Zealand, although, I've heard in the Lake district they prefer a bit more personality!",Brokeback Mountain
1465,klea_meiguo,A movie that will never leave you,10,1 February 2006,"This movie was extraordinary - two weeks after seeing it, I still find myself thinking about it. Prior to seeing it, I had expected to appreciate it, but I didn't expect the furor with which it hit me. A few minutes into the movie, I completely forgot that it portrayed a homosexual relationship, I simply knew it was a story of unfolding love and the struggles to fulfill that love. And I was entranced. The next hours passed in seemingly no time at all, but also with the feeling that I'd been there with them those tragic years.It is so moving, a subtle force that gets into your head and heart and leaves you a changed person.The sad disappointing fact is that most people will never see this movie. Here in Utah, theaters have banned it on religious principles and it is boycotted with regularity. They ban it and boycott it without even wondering what they are missing, how their world view could be broadened, without seeing how intolerant they are being.10/10 of course, this movie will be purchased and on my shelf as soon as it is released.Unforgettable.",Brokeback Mountain

The characters are not sophisticated or highly educated. The story involves a search for love, something, as Jake Gyllenhaal would later say, we all struggle with.I didn't think I could be sadder than I was after seeing this wonderful, touching film. I had to search within myself to find the chord that gave the experience the interpretation that would make me love it as I do now.Heath's death makes the world a colder place, and he was just an actor I never knew. I am so grateful he did this film.",Brokeback Mountain
1467,beatriz_spain,I can't sleep since I saw it!!,10,28 January 2006,"I am 25-year-old Spanish who loves cinema very much, but it is the first time I feel impressed enough to write a comment (first of all, I beg your pardon if my English is not very good). I saw the film 4 days ago and I cannot take it from my mind.Next day it was my birthday and I had not the energy to get out from bed to celebrate it with my family. I was surrounded by presents and all the stuff and I was all the time elsewhere, in Brokeback Mountain It is the most impressive, beautiful and emotive film I have seen in all my life. It is full of moments that do not let you breath because your throat is closed by emotion (I am crying right now). I do not know why I feel so affected (my friends liked the film very much, but they do not feel the same as I do) but it has come right to my heart. I am even a bit angry at Ang Lee for making me feel like this! Cinema is supposed to provide you a good time, entertainment, and, in the case of good films, a period of reflection and discussion with friends, but it is not supposed to turn your life upside down!!!! I know it sounds exaggerated, but it is what I feel and I have felt released to discover that many reviewers feel like me. I think this film is a celebration of love in its purest state and it has made me reconsider my whole conception of life: I am a very happy girl who happens to have a heterosexual relationship (it seems that I am lucky because I love in the ""proper"" way, and nobody takes into account that love has no a proper form, because it hits your heart, not your mind, and it is what makes it beautiful). Besides, I live in the 20th century in a big town and it seems (at least in theory) that homosexuality is accepted by society. However, sometimes I feel self-absorbed by my job and my social life and my boyfriend is the last of my list. After seeing this film, it won't happen again; I am lucky because I can bring my relationship to the light, whereas Ennis and Jack spend their lives hiding from society (my heart ached as I saw them growing older without being together) although it is the most beautiful love story I have ever seen. It shows that love brings life to us: Ennis spend all his life in a gloomy, sad mood except when he is with Jack, in these moments he is at ease and his face lightens. I was all the time desiring to shout at him: ""Go with him, stupid!! It is your life, do not allow society to handle it!"", but I suppose there were different times. The acting of both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal is amazing (in contrast to other viewers, I cannot choose one of them over the other) and Michelle Williams offers a brilliant performance as the devastated Alma. The other actors provide very realistic performances too. I think that the main merit of this film is the constrained way in which the story is told. The looks and the silences (mainly in the cases of Ennis and Alma) are more telling than words. Seeing Ennis crying the first time they part, and then Jack's tears when he goes to Mexico goes right to your heart, much more than any love declaration. Besides, Lee does not use the easy resource of portraying a homophobic society in which homosexuals are despised. The only perspectives in the film are Jack's and Ennis' and it makes the film more intimate and beautiful. To end, I want to ask a question: Am I the only one who have spent the last sleepless night trying to find an alternative ending? Mr Lee: I want Ennis and Jack to be together forever!!",Brokeback Mountain
1468,denvrital,"Great story, great acting, great entertainment",10,20 December 2005,"I really enjoyed this movie. I am a romantic guy, and this really tug at my heartstrings. I could relate to a lot of what was portrayed in the film, as far as falling in love; long distance relationships, and losing someone after sharing years building that relationship. As someone once wrote in a song... ""Its sad to belong to someone else, when the RIGHT one comes along."" Both Heath Ledger, and Jake Gyllenhaal did an incredible job showing just enough emotion to keep the sparks going, but even after the on and off hook up's for 20 years, they still seem to have kept that intense fire burning. That has to be tough on anyone; especially hiding the whole thing from the wife and kids. It's also amazing to note that while this film was set in a 20 or so year span, dating back to 1963, it still mirrors situations that are very much relevant in today's society. There are still a lot of closeted ""GAY"" cowboys living very obscure lives in rural towns and cities all across the west, and mid-west. This movie might even help a few of these guys become a little less closeted. All in all, its a must-see movie.",Brokeback Mountain
1469,scorpio68,"Why ""Brokeback Mountain"" got me so good...",10,16 June 2006,"""Brokeback Mountain"" is an extraordinary film, a haunting, moving masterwork from Ang Lee. This film is a love story for the ages, and contains an amazing performance by Heath Ledger. I've never seen a same-sex relationship presented in a mainstream Hollywood film as it's presented here...this is a film about two people, painfully in love, and really, it's only a secondary concern that the two people involved are both men. Heath Ledger gives a career-making performance as the deeply closeted, withdrawn, tortured Ennis del Mar, and Jake Gyllenhaal is outstanding as the more open-minded, gregarious Jack Twist. The Score is melancholic and unforgettable...the music is almost another character in this film. The last 30 minutes of this film pack an emotional wallop that's hard to shake for days after. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a triumph for Ang Lee, and an unforgettable movie. Incredibly moving, what an achievement.",Brokeback Mountain
1470,dhainazi-1,He was a friend of mine...,10,19 October 2007,"Brokeback Mountain is truly one of the best love movies I have ever seen, which probably also include those I have ever heard. ""I swear... I swear..."" Jack murmured to Ennis when they were sharing intimacy for the first time in that small tent... The softness in the way that him said it has long made me wonder what he was swearing for... This is a love story without the word being said. Back to 30 years ago, it is hard to imagine how two guys could possibly articulate their feelings towards each other, although they knew that, even more than we do, it was there. At the last night they were together by the mountain, Jack muttered, staring at the river, ""Tell you what... truth is, sometimes I miss you so much that I can hardly stand it"". Since that moment, I started weeping and then cried when the desperation inside Jack was yelled out on the next day they were apart forever. Actually I am probably wrong here, it already broke my heart when Jack drove away to Mexico with teary eyes after he realized that Ennis's divorce still couldn't have them live together and wouldn't give him what he was hoping for. Now, it's been four days since I watched this movie this Tuesday, but the longing and sadness in Jack's blue eyes are still haunting me, after having me emotionally drained. I have been thinking what would have happened if Ennis had known ""the rest"" (about the homosexual love). Would he have the courage to built a real life with Jack without being tortured by self-loathing in his mind through the whole life? The shirts that were hung together for twenty years would not have been the only thing that they owned from each other. I actually doubt whether the two characters knew what gay was. Love between them was such a raw and limpid force, which can perfectly be left unsaid. If you ask me whether I have noticed such strong affection was between two men. No, honestly. What only matters here is the love between two human beings. ""Jack, I swear..."" Ennie buttoned Jack's shirt that was then hanging in his own closet. What were you swearing, Ennis? Still blaming Jack for the love he constantly gave and tried to have your commitment? For Ennis, the only person he could reciprocate love with was far gone, leaving him with the broken memories by Brokeback mountain and the regrets in his loneliness. The movie is almost flawless in all aspects. The setting, the acting, the photographing and even the sexual scenes in all constructed this heartbreaking story perfectly. I don't need to comment anymore on the acting of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, with all that been said by everyone else. All the supporting casting are perfect as well. The only hope seen in the movie was when Jack's mother padded on Ennis's shoulder with the amiable smile on her face. She knew what was going between her boy and Ennis, and she was supportive, although such comfort was so late for either Ennis or Jack. It took me a long time to write such a short review, probably because the film hit me too hard. While being slightly released, I am sure the film will still live with me for a long time.",Brokeback Mountain

It takes place deep in sixties America, and as such shows homophobia in its harshest light.

There isn't one thing wrong with the story, direction or acting IMO.I must confess to being leery of this film. Not because of the subject matter but because I've not been overly impressed with the talents of the cast, particularly Heath Ledger.But reading all the reviews convinced me that this was one film that I definitely needed to give a viewing and I'm so glad I did. If Heath doesn't walk away with the Oscar for this role it will be a travesty IMO. Jake Gyllenhaal too gives an Oscar worthy performance. It saddens me that both men would probably cancel each other out if put in for lead actor so here's hoping that Jake will get at the very least a nod for supporting with Heath getting the lead actor statuette.The story is so well done and Ang Lee does a masterful job of transferring it to the screen.I can not recommend this film highly enough.

1475,doctordon,In response to a Christian who won't see the film.,10,3 February 2006,"This is a copy of a post I just entered on a thread about this film on the main boards. It's in response to a Christian fellow who wrote that he would not see the film because it depicts homosexual sex scenes and homosexuality is a sin. I posted a reply because I hope all people, especially my Christian sisters and brothers, see this film, which made me feel so aware of the presence of God in the lives of all of broken humanity.Everything seems to be woven together perfectly in this masterpiece of directing, screen writing, cinematography, music, acting and, of course, the story itself which is one that any human being with any heart, compassion and experience in love and loss should be able to relate to deeply.I'm a devoted film enthusiast who's seen over 6000 films in almost five decades and this film is the first one to move me to write on these boards since the fabulous ""Dancer Upstairs"". I've seen it four times and will see it many more. The first time I saw it in Vancouver was on opening night in an old theatre downtown. I figure I was one of thirty heterosexual men, forty women and 900 gay men in the audience. Turned out that was all right. Hasn't made me want to have sex with a man. Has certainly made me feel deeply about being a man, a human, a person with a heart, a soul, and the wisdom I've gained from my own experience with love and loss.This is a beautiful film in every respect. To our Christian friend who started this thread, I'll say this: I saw Jesus everywhere in this film. The Jesus who didn't sit down and talk about the fine points of the law in the temple with the Pharisees and scribes, because there is no such Jesus. I mean the Jesus who embodies love: active, exuberant, irrepressible, abiding, profound, ridiculously extravagant, timeless love. The compassionate Jesus who scandalously spent time with the tax collectors and prostitutes and downtrodden and centurion and loved them all, yes, even those Pharisees and scribes whom he so pitied and whom he tried to instruct with his witty admonitions. This is the Jesus I saw in Jack and Ennis, and in Lureen and Alma, and in Alma Jr. and Cassie and especially in Jack's mother who responds to her husband's bitter, vicious attack on Ennis with an immensely moving compassion that reminds me of the salt of the earth people where I was raised in rural Illinois long ago.I hope that everyone with a heart, with compassion for others, sees this film and experiences the profound confirmation it gives to what is most important about being human -- the fact that we are blessed with the ability to taste of the very nature of God Himself, which is love. For as John writes in his first letter, the most important sentence among the hundreds of books I've read: God is Love.And perfect love casts out all fear. Don't be afraid to see this film. Everything good comes from God. This film is truly a gift to the heart.",Brokeback Mountain

1477,Kris_AB,Probably the most faithful book-to-screen adaptation ever,10,17 December 2005,"I'd read the short story last summer (by Annie Proulx, the same woman who wrote The Shipping News--which got adapted into an _okay_ film, IMO---you can find Brokeback in an anthology of hers called Wyoming Stories, or as its own small book more recently). The movie was absolutely faithful to the source material, right down to the dialogue. Aside from adding a bit of content to fill out a 2 hour film and taking out maybe one or two small flashback/dialogue explanations, everything seemed in place. I'll have to read the story again and maybe see the film one more time to be sure, but the spirit of the story is right there up on screen, pure and not tampered with by spineless Hollywood script doctors.Great performances from Heath Ledger (Two Hands, A Knight's Tale, Monster's Ball, the TV series Roar) and Jake Gyllenhaal (who's good in everything he's in--Donnie Darko, The Good Girl, Lovely & Amazing, Moonlight Mile). From the supporting cast as well.Beautifully shot. I'll go ahead and spoil that Alberta, Canada is standing in for the state of Wyoming. Having never been to either, it seemed to do its job well enough.There are some cute animals, for those who enjoy those in movies. Sheep, sheep dogs, coyotes, horses. There are also incidental animal deaths, as a warning to those who're squeamish (or as an invitation to those who like brief glimpses of convincing gore--not my thing personally, but I'm trying to be inclusive here).If you've considered it at all, don't wait to rent it. If you're like me and usually wait for most straight-up dramas to hit DVD, while spending your theatre bucks on films that really take advantage of big surround sound and a large screen (sci-fi, fantasy, action), know that this one's scenic visuals are worthy of the size. As are the actors, if you like. For those of us who're into eye candy, there's a bit of equal opportunity nudity among the two leading men and the two main supporting ladies, plus the guys fill out good 'ol boy southern-style gear real nicely.Yeah, I didn't really tell you much about the film.

I had no idea how much the movie would effect me. I think I cried twice in the theater, and three times tonight when I saw it again at home on cable. Not a tear, i mean balling for about a minute each time.The music clinches the deal; when you look at Ennis and the music plays that sad, lonely tune, you cannot help but tear up, unless your inhuman. This is by far the best love story I have ever seen, and I am a sucker for a good love story. The way that Ennis fights it at first and tries to tell himself it isn't true, and the way you see him hurting inside after he realizes his love for Jack is the deepest and most real emotion he will ever feel. . it just.. ya know?. . . . .This is a movie that should be in everyone's collection.

The whole film is dotted with extremely moving little scenes, among my favourites the look on Jack and Ennis's faces at one lakeside meeting, Jack's statement that ""sometimes he misses Ennis so much he can hardley stand it, and then the look on Jacks face as Ennis rides off in the flashback sequence, a look of absolute contentment. The last twenty minutes of the film, I found really heartbreaking. Anyone who has lost someone they love would understand Ennis's caressing of Jacks twenty year old bloodstained shirt, anything to be near the one you love. The final scene, Ennis buttoning the shirt his eyes welling with tears, and muttering ""Jack I swear..."" surely invites the viewer to add the ending ""I love you"", not ""I loved you"" just ""I love you""",Brokeback Mountain
1481,roger-lord,A deeply moving film - an exceptional artistic achievement!,10,24 May 2008,"Over the years, I have seen lots of films of very diverse origins. I don't watch movies to be sermonized, lectured and preached upon. I don't like to be pushed around and manipulated by frantic editing, by an artificially fast rhythm, or by incessant music. I have come to appreciate truthfulness & subtlety in art and in film: the beauty of a smile, the intensity of a glance, the profound meaning of silence.""Brokeback Mountain is an extraordinarily special film. One of the most touching love stories in decades, Brokeback Mountain slowly weaves its magic, moving forward at a languid pace and ever so gently working its way into your heart. There's no rushing into the film, no need to fill every moment with dialogue. Some movies take their time laying the story out and settling over the audience. Brokeback Mountain is one of those films. [] One of the most beautiful love stories to hit the screen in years, Brokeback Mountain is as close to being a perfect film as you can get."" (from ""Brokeback Mountain - A Truly Memorable Love Story"", Movie Review by Rebecca Murray, About.com).I must say that though I had read the brilliant set of Annie Proulx's short stories (""Close Range: Wyoming Stories"") prior to the release of Ang Lee's film, I was not prepared for what awaited me when I saw Brokeback Mountain for the first time almost 2½ years ago. I was floored, transfixed, shattered, speechless. Since I share the feelings expressed by ""carr-6 from Sweden"" on April 12, I'm tempted to quote her: ""My whole life will be divided into before Brokeback and after Brokeback. It quite literally changed my life. I was rocked to my core. The movie took over my head and my heart and I will never be the same. No movie has ever or will ever impact on me like this."" After its glorious victory at the Venice International Film Festival, Ang Lee's unforgettable masterpiece was highly anticipated and, it lived up to the expectations. I have seen this film more times than any other film and, each time, I have inevitably been deeply moved.BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN was named BEST PICTURE of 2005 by more than 30 groups, guilds & organizations around the world, and deservedly so. This film requires a certain maturity and open-mindedness from the viewer and might therefore not be everyone's cup of tea, but there is no denying that this film made history and is already a true classic. Brokeback Mountain does not fit the typical Hollywood mold and stands without a doubt as one of the most exceptional and best movies in the history of cinema. Very highly recommended.",Brokeback Mountain
1482,K-Dowell,"""If you can't fix it...you have to stand it.""",10,30 May 2008,"This movie completely blew me away. The first time I seen it was about a week ago, and I caught it on TV. I didn't get to see the start of it, so I missed Jack and Ennis' time on the mountain. But, expecting a ""gay cowboy"" movie, I was pretty sure what had happened. But, as the story unfolded even more,I felt so guilty for labelling it such a simplistic, shallow, and cruel title. It is so much more. It is a heart-breaking, gut-wrenching, love story that whether you like it or not will move you deeply and stay with you for a long long time after watching it. When Ennis says, ""I ain't queer,"" and Jack replies, ""Me neither,"" I believe them. They're just two confused young men who only know that they shouldn't be feeling what they are feeling for each other.The characters of Jack and Ennis to me, are not just charatcers of fiction, but have been portrayed so well that I believe them to be real people. I don't know why this movie affected me as I did. It's not relevant to me, I'm not confused about my sexuality, but this movie has stayed with me constantly since watching it about a week ago. After watching it on TV, I immediately went out the next day and bought it on DVD, and every night since buying it, have stayed up till roughly 2 in the morning, in order to watch it. And, of course, after watching it have lay awake for what feels like hours afterwards thinking about it. It feels like my ""fix"". I think about it during the day, but knowing that I'll watch it later on makes me feel better about it. And I'm always left at the end with the credits rolling, sobbing quietly to myself. I guess this is me not fixing it, but standing it. This movie just won't get out of my head. I feel united with everyone who seems to be describing the same 'sympthons' as me, with random scenes flashing into my head, and quoting it to myself. Sometimes this makes me smile, and other times I just want to go away and cry.It's like it's become my obsession which I can't share with anyone else, because they'll think I'm weird. I did make my friend watch it with me the other day, but she didn't seem too bothered about it, which amazed me at how she couldn't be affected. But, she's one of these people who thinks that when no-one is talking, that makes a movie boring. Every time I hear the first two notes of the completely brilliant and beautiful score, I break into sobs for what I know is coming over the next two hours. The music which accompanies this movie is brilliant, and captures the feel of it amazingly. All of Gustavo Santaolalla's score is outstanding and tugs at the heartstrings like nothing I've ever heard before. The song 'He was a friend of mine', and the lyrics 'Every time I think of him, I just can't help but crying"" sums up how I feel about Jack and Ennis. And Wainwrights 'Maker Makes' another thing of beauty. The strange thing is, Brokeback has never made me cry tears, I sob dry-eyed watching the movie that has made me feel broken inside. Even though it sounds bad that it's making me feel so negative, this has become my favourite movie.*SPOILER* My favourite scene in the whole movie, is the 'flashback' in the final scene that Jack and Ennis are in together. When Ennnis comes up behind Jack and holds him, it makes me smile, because they both look so happy and content with each other, having nothing else to worry about except the sheep, and it seems they have come to terms with what they feel. But, on coming down from the mountain this certainty wobbles and leads to the lie of the rest of their lives. The come-back to reality and the change in Jack's face from a look of happiness to one of utter brokenness is crushing.And whenever the letter came back with 'deceased', I was in complete disbelief, I could not believe it. It felt like losing someone I had known.I just feel like I had to leave a comment to try to get all of this emotion out of me, and help me ""get over"" this movie which has really messed me up, and left me with what feels like a grieving process, like I'm mourning the loss of Jack and the utter sadness Ennis is living in. The last three words, ""Jack, I swear..."", and the look in Ennis' eyes says so many things that words can't convey, and followed by the sorrowful strumming of 'The Wings' is something that breaks my heart even to think about. I don't think this movie will ever leave me, nor it's effect, but I think I need to get all this out of me somehow.I would like to end with a Thank You to the people who made this movie what it is. If anyone else had tried, it could have been done so badly, but this movie is a beautiful masterpiece which will be remembered forever, by the people who felt its effect the most. The acting and the directing, the scenes accomplished are incredible.The End.",Brokeback Mountain
1483,meg_dias,Heartbreaking,10,25 December 2013,"One of the most beautiful love histories ever told on screens. Every frame is so full of sadness, I barely can take it. And the Gustavo Santaolalla's soundtrack... ""The Wings"" lacerate any heart.Both actors are splendidly beautiful and talented. Jake Gyllenhaal looks like an angel, lending those sad eyes to the character. Heath's superb suffocated performance becomes even more painful every time you remember the actor passed away.It takes courage to do such thing and how brave they were! The scenes between them are so full of truth, something that only two great, great actors could've done. And the delicacy of Ang Lee is touching.""Love is a force of nature"". Yes, it is.

1484,dmainor,Two Cowboys Fall In Love with One Another,10,13 January 2006,"Brokeback Mountain is a remarkably compelling, strangely haunting film of superb quality. It just may have the capability of changing the viewer's life. Heath and Jake give performances that are quite frankly beautiful, far out distancing many of their young contemporaries in an industry that is obsessed with the franchise concept of film-making. Generally, the film strives to touch emotions that are not easily understand, discerned or experienced but always tumultuous and wrenching. When Jake's character,Jack Twist proclaims, ""I wish I could get over you"" his voice is filled with such angst that it makes the scene almost unbearable. Then, in the same scene, Heath's character, Ennis, proceeds to take the audience somewhere so intense that it is almost like another planet of emotion. This is really a deeply moving, deeply affecting film that should be viewed by all people, gay and straight. In its own way, though somewhat sad, Brokeback Mountain affirms gay relationships in that it presents affect to mere sex. Afterall, homosexuality is an affectionate preference as well as a sexual one. This film proves it.",Brokeback Mountain

Truly Remarkable,10,10 August 2008,"I don't know why but i cannot get this movie out of my head i watched it 3 days ago and still cannot get that scene out of my head when Heath Ledger says' Why don't you just let me be?'. And i came on IMDb and realised that other people also feel the same, i truly did not know that this film was going to have this effect on me, i try to avoid films like these which leave these kind of effects on me but i am still grateful i was able to watch this movie. I think my only wish is that if only Heath Ledger was still alive today. R.I.P You are going down on my lists of Legends..Including Ang Lee for directing it. and letting us have the experience of a lifetime because the love was portrayed so beautifully The films score was remarkable...but i cant listen to it for now because it reminds me of Ennis too much..For now i'm just going to hope to accept that Heath Ledger is gone but i will never forget this Superb actor's Performance",Brokeback Mountain
1486,b-budd,The most over rated film of the year,4,29 January 2006,"***** May contain spoilers, but I doubt this film could be spoiled *****Before viewing this movie I was filled with high expectations. Indeed the IMDb message boards are filled with high praise, not just for the movie but for the exceptional acting performance from Heath Ledger. Indeed the first comment on the message on the board tells us that 'Seriously - this film will live with you for a long, long time.'Seriously, give me a break. This film is dull with a capital D. It dragged on so much that a good half an hour before the end of the film I was praying for the credits to save me. The film starts with the two leads heading towards the title mountain where they shag. They then go back home, realizing that they are cowboys and cowboys shouldn't really be doing that sort of thing. They go home and wed and sleep with women to prove to themselves that it must have been all those sheep that made them do that. Of course it's not because they then start a cycle of going back to the mountain to 'fish' then returning home to carry on with their separate lives. The film pushes the point again and again and again, that these two men were really in love but couldn't really except it themselves and that society itself would condemn them. I got this point in the first half of the film there really was no point to the rest of it and why oh why didn't they just move to San Francisco.The pace of this film is slow and ponderous. The acting is positively dull. If Heath Ledger gets any awards for this performance then there really is no justice. Check out Sean Penn in the The Assassination of Richard Nixon for a top draw acting performance. Ledger should go back to films like A Knight's Tale, they are more within his scope. Jake Gyllenhaal who has impressed this bear greatly with his performances thus far is reduced to a stare form under a cowboy hat. The best performance was of the grizzly bear that for some strange reason was not mentioned in the credits. His performance should surely merit a best supporting actor nomination? Directed by Ang Lee, this film has a couple of scenes that are pleasing to the eye, but hey they were in the mountains. Even I, a bear, could take pretty pictures in a place of natural beauty. The Director should maybe think now about making the Hulk 2 as this is where his talents lie. 4/10 just for Gyllenhall and the bear.",Brokeback Mountain
1487,noodles1948,"Two shirts, One love",8,29 January 2009,"*** This comment may contain spoilers ***I once watched BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN by Ang Lee at the age of 14 when I started to fall in love with movies and pretended to have understood everything in a movie, such as BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN.Therefore, it fade away from my memory very soon.Three years later, After watching WO HU CANG LONG by Ang Lee, I ""reviewed"" this wonderful movie this evening and kept running the details over and over in my head when it finished. As far as I am concerned, it is the best homosexuality movie that I have ever seen.The Brokeback Mountain makes a fine scene in Ang Lee's camera. In the mountain, Ennis and Jack found it impossible to refuse the love between two men. Obviously, Jack loved Ennis too much, just as what he said, ""I want to know how to quit you."" He devoted himself to this love. However, due to Ennis' father and childhood, he wanna live a ""normal"" life while loving Jack. Here the tragedy comes. ""In the twenty years"" they couldn't live together and their family got really a mess.It's really a remarkable, limpid and moving film. The feeling lingers and the images come back. Everyone is moved at the sight of the two shirts holding each other, which are just like the former Jack and Ennis. A question is frequently asked: How did Jack die? I think he died just because of an accident, for his wife looked sad when answering that heartbreaking call. The picture in Ennis' mind is just the result of his father and his unfortunate childhood.""I swear, Jack...""",Brokeback Mountain
1488,macsband,Yet another stereotype of gay men as pathetic,1,1 November 2008,"Brokeback Mountain is yet another attempt by Hollywood to stereotype gay men as pathetic (as demonstrated in the documentary ""The Celluloid Closet""). The author, Annie Proulx, does not get inside the head of gay men. Her characters lapse in the abyss instead of answering the call to complete The Hero's Journey (per Joseph Campbell) which is the foundation of all great fiction. Instead of confronting and conquering their fears, Jack & Ennis end up as two pathetic men, crippled by a society that tells them how a man must feel. Too bad Ang Lee couldn't bring to this film the kind of integrity he showed in ""The Wedding Banquet"" (Xi Yan).",Brokeback Mountain
1489,tbcass,Run of the mill love story,5,23 February 2009,"I believe this movie is overrated. My wife and I watched this together and agreed on this. I thought the characters were rather one dimensional, esp Heath Ledger who played such a dull bland character that I couldn't relate to him at all. As I watched this I tried to put aside the fact that the 2 main characters were Gay and watch it for what it was, a story of forbidden love. As such it has much in common with West Side Story and Romeo and Juliet. Sorry, but I've seen this theme done too many times and often better than it's presented here. It probably made a good short story but for a full length movie it really dragged on. I would have liked it a lot more if it ran for only an hour. In conclusion it's an OK love story that stands out only because the lovers were gay men.",Brokeback Mountain
1490,maria-tzintzis,Accepting people for who they are,10,18 November 2008,"I watched Brokeback Mountain for the first time 2 weeks ago. Someone gave me a copy about 2 years ago but could not bring myself to watch it. But being Australian I wanted to see Heath Ledger and also have seen a few movies with Jake Gyllenhall who I think is also a great actor.I have read people's comments about how its a beautiful love story and so on, but for me it was all that but more important it was an education about accepting people for who they are and not judge them for their preferances in life. Before Brokeback Mountain I would cringe at 2 guys kissing or even holding hands now I see it as 2 people being in love and that is because of the great performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall.I thank them both for making this great film so believable that has touched me so deeply.",Brokeback Mountain
1491,Elunelight,A Transcending and Heartbreaking Masterpiece,10,23 March 2010,"In the first half of the film, the story characterizes two main characters and shows the development of love of the two cowboys, Ennis del Mar and Jack Twist. Ennis is a person who does not speak much. He has capability to hide his emotions and shows only glimpses of them (esp. with Jack). But his capability has limit. His outburst of emotion consequently comes with intensity. Jack is more emotional, optimistic and dreaming guy; sometimes impractical. He is also sensible to Ennis' feelings.Because of these complex characteristics of two, it demands depth and great understanding from two actors to realize the characters. And Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal satisfy that demand. Actually, the two actors become the two characters. Their acting are very subtle and yet powerful. The development of their love is also perfect. Their love does not pop-up from nowhere. But as they live in Brokeback Mountain, the attraction gradually and subtly pulls them together and creates their irrevocable bond. There is nothing artificial here. Their acting is pure, and thus it transcend the sexuality. They are essentially two souls that fall in love with each other.To view the second half, we have to prepare for series of heartbreaking and yet beautiful scenes. We see how they long for each other while they separately live in the closet. Once they meet each other, we are convinced that everything will be as good as in Brokeback again. But no. We are constantly pulled back to the reality that the society won't just allow them to have happy life together. We feel how hard they struggle with it, and the conclusion is just beautifully tragic.It seems unfair not to mention other actresses and actors. Michelle Williams as Alma, Ennis's broken wife, is just excellent. The way she trembles, the way she explodes her feelings are just so real and moving. Anne Hathaway as Lureen Newsome, Jack's wife, is also great, although we have not seen her much. But she pulls out her scenes so well that it becomes one of my favorites. Roberta Maxwell as Jack's graceful mother just radiates her compassion through her words and her actions.But It is Ang Lee who crafts these beautiful nuanced scenes and weaves them together. He is just a maestro. Everything is perfectly drawn and shown. Every second has its meaning and contributes to the plot of the stories. He combines the dazzling performances of the cast, the ways to show them, and moving music by Gustavo Santaolalla together.He just knows how to make this cinematographic phenomena.Forget about bad names or remarks given to this film. Go to see it. It is never too late, since the value of Brokeback Mountain will always remain.",Brokeback Mountain
1492,snowdawgab,Brilliant in every possible way....,10,16 November 2005,"This film was brilliant in every possible way. Visually stunning, Director Ang Lee and Director Of Photography Rodrigo Prieto have outdone themselves. What a breathtaking display of what Alberta, Canada has to offer! Performances by Jake and Heath are absolutely amazing. I hope we see more of Michelle Williams in the future, her perfect performance was a very pleasant surprise. I can not say enough good things about how this movie made me feel, I wish I could go see it again and again. This movie is a beautifully written love story and not at all what I'm sure the general public assumes it to be. Films like Brokeback Mountain do not come along very often. I would highly recommend it to anyone who has a passion for true film making. Definitely Oscar worthy!",Brokeback Mountain
1493,markwsutton,This is a film that can do some good.,10,16 December 2005,"This film hits home runs in just about every category. Starting with a great screenplay, the film was beautifully cast, directed, shot and edited.At the center of the film Heath Ledger is phenomenal. He is a study of the taciturn American man, reluctant to communicate or let others in, limited by lack of education and a rough upbringing. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is up there, too, instigating, charming, looking for a good time. Ultimately the characters are good 'ol boys who fall into a passionate affair.The world where their relationship develops could not be further removed from contemporary techno-urban life than if it took place on Mars. Against this austere environment their relationship seems distilled and pure.The filmmakers offer the viewer a window into the honesty and humanity of intimacy which happens to be same-sex and the complications which result in the larger world. The film is heartbreaking.",Brokeback Mountain
1494,Bazzle1991,Fascinating story.,10,28 September 2012,"This is one of my favourite films of all time.I found myself truly drawn to the story and related to it.The infamous ""tent scene"" meant a lot to me as me and one of my friends ,lets just call him ""Jack"" went away to the lake district one summer and all of the awkward feelings towards each other were consummated that night.I had never felt so true to myself and complete with my emotions. This is why I enjoy this film in all its truthful and gritty portrayal of two men struggling with their feelings towards each other.Me and ""Jack"" sometimes struggle to reenact that wonderful night and the passion we shared for each others beauty,But when we watched brokeback mountain all the fond memories came flooding back and our hands once again slowly moved towards each other in the summer night gracefully lit by the glow of the TV as the ""tent scene"" played out before us.",Brokeback Mountain
1495,farrago,"Stunning and Devastating - yes, but what is this film actually about?",7,26 February 2006,"**SPOILER WARNING**While I suppose I can see the critical acclaim (especially here in Britain where the film has offered people a re-assuring alternative to the alarming legislative agenda of the Christian Right in America), I can't honestly say that I enjoyed ""Brokeback Mountain."" It came across as a lavishly filmed, two-hour public service announcement about the twin dangers of homophobic violence and repressed sexuality (and the relationship between the two) in the red States. But the real problem with this film lies elsewhere, and I am surprised that no one has pointed it out. This isn't actually a love story. It is a period piece, but one that uses a mental model of male homosexuality that was current in, maybe, 1964. Ennis and Jack aren't presented so much as characters as psycho-pathologies: two emotionally crippled teen-aged boys. What little we learn about their background turns on their relationships with their respective fathers: for Jack, it's a story of rejection and disapproval; for Ennis, one of devastating loss. As Ennis admits, he hasn't spoken more than 10 words in the past year. What they discover, together, that summer at Brokeback Mountain, is the ability to feel. It's touching, for certain. After a frantic tumble, they start to thaw out. But they're also (understandably) confused and overwhelmed by their emotions and have no way to understand them. So for the next twenty years, they keep re-enacting the same primal scene on Brokeback Mountain. The NYTimes reviewer recalls Proulx's prose to make a somewhat different point: ""What Jack remembered and craved in a way he could neither help nor understand was the time that distant summer on Brokeback when Ennis had come up behind him and pulled him close, the silent embrace satisfying some shared and sexless hunger.""And that's the problem. The central tragedy of the film isn't so much love denied as life denied. For various reasons (framed mostly as societal, but also Ennis' own traumatic childhood encounter with homophobic violence), they don't have an opportunity to find out if they really do want to spend their lives together. No surprise then that the first summer has the hold it does over their lives. But this isn't adult male homosexuality. And I am not sure it helps the gay rights movement to have people thinking it is. This presentation of male homosexuality as a sanitized, hermetically-sealed adolescent experimentation is probably why - quite contrary to the predictions of Conservative pundits - people in places like Texas, Montana, Colorado and Wyoming are running off to see it. The story is sad, but it's not challenging. I suppose if it convinces a handful of people to discourage their neighbors and teenage sons from taking tire irons to other people's skulls, then it's probably not the worst film of 2005 by any stretch. It's just not half as thoughtful as it pretends, or all that penetrating. The film loyally preserves the narrative voice of a character whose fragile emotional stability rests on a determined lack of self-understanding. Heath Ledger did a good job of conveying the emotional desolation. That part, at least, is compelling, and I hope he gets an Oscar for it.",Brokeback Mountain
1496,ani-bekk,The best in it's kind?,10,18 February 2006,"Well, I saw this movie yesterday, although I didn't want to. Read about the plot and thought it sounded strange. Didn't think it sounded interesting at ALL. But my friend convinced me, and during the movie I was totally swept away. Swept away by great acting,(not to forget) great scenery and a great plot. And my God, what a tragedy. Forbidden love with a sad ending. I nearly had to laugh, watching Heath Ledger as the quiet and tough type. Confused about his feelings, and the playing and ""fighting"" between ""Ennis"" and ""Jack"" I will never forget. Some kind of fear of their own feelings. All in all, this is a story about true love, and following the hearts desire. But in this story, it was ""impossible"". At first I thought it was strange, watching two heteroes acting gay, but I forgot about it fast. Because of great acting, and like I mentioned before, this is truly a love story and it goes straight to the heart, whether you're hetero or gay. This is really a deep movie we might have a lot to learn from. Way to go Heath and Jake!!",Brokeback Mountain

Each time I meet these people I find new and subtle aspects in their open, cotton comfortable performances. This group made a great team. All the performers deliver the goods, especially the women, who are a real backbone and counter-arch to the film's heartbreaking love story and they perform best in the small places that reveal the accumulative frustration from all the existential angles Lee focuses his eye on. We feel sympathy and love for all of them. Compassion for all of them, right down to poor Ennis Del Mar's post-marriage fling, Linda Cardellini's, Cassie. In love with quiet withdrawn broke-hearted Ennis. The long, delicate climb into the heart of the film begins with the spiritual union of these two mountain herding men, Ennis Del Mar and Jack Twist up on Brokeback Mountain one long summer ago. Two men absolutely singular in character as they are opposite in natures. Both trying to understand their other selves and the object of this sudden desire, need and want for the other man. Not an easy item on the menu for Wyoming 1963 and this tear in the painting shatters us from within little by little. It is a doomed affair from the horse kick.But we are roped into the tale and allowed to watch it unfold casually, in rhythm with the naturalistic tone of the world it inhabits. A world of open skies, space, mountains and rivers. Lee invites us to visit unobtrusively yet intimately that we may discover, slowly, gently, purposefully overhear and watch his little population of two cowboys, moving among the sheep, clouds, dusty roads and freshet streams on horseback and sometimes crawling into the tiniest of places in the human heart. Rodrigo Prieto has shot a clean well-captured landscape. Each tableau a luminous and engulfing mise en scene. His camera places these individual's lives in the context of their size, the size of their longing, to the Great Immensity of the Northwestern territory of Wyoming. Though we know Brokeback was shot in Alberta, in the Canadian Rockies, the camera captures the timeless eternity and the empty solitude between these character's inner souls and their external realities within the period (mid 1963) and the context of their love to the landscapes they inhabit together and apart.The film feels natural and real. Relaxed in its boots.There are minor things that hurt the film, the visual make up to indicate the character's aging for one, looked pretty obvious and distracted. But the performances outdo any flaw every time. The thing is, every time you get up there to Brokeback it tears your heart open as well as Annie's story did before it and that in itself speaks volumes.",Brokeback Mountain

I have never seen a movie that spoke to me as much as this one.The performances in this film were astounding. Jake Gyllenhal and Heath Ledger give the performances of the year. They portray such raw emotion and desperation with such ease. I forgot about the fact I was watching a film and became a part of their experience. Jack and Ennis' relationship is that of an epic love story. Over the 20 years we see it getting stronger and deeper, more heartbreaking. Heath Ledger's performance is Oscar gold. When he finds out that his Jack has died we see a quiet sadness that tears at his being and sends a blow to his soul. In the last half an hour Ennis' emotional vulnerability breaks my heart. Jake Gyllenhal's performance is achingly beautiful. For one person to be willing to risk everything is the ultimate love. Jack has come to terms with who he is only to realize that Ennis most likely never will. Here are two people that could have lived a life full of companionship and true love but due to the way this world works were left in hiding with their secret. No one should ever have to live the way these two did. The supporting roles are just as poetic. Michelle Williams made me forget about Dawson's Creek and Halloween: H20. She is a gifted actress who has finally earned the respect she has been fighting for. Anne Hathaway, while in less of the movie, did an incredible job. The scene in the end on the phone with Ennis was one of her best scenes. Fantastic cast.My hat is off to Ang Lee, who created a masterpiece that will endure forever. Beautifully shot, thoughtfully told, Brokeback Mountain is his crowning achievement. To take a script that didn't yet have a place with mainstream audiences, to believe in the material and to create one of the greatest love stories of all time is something to be proud of. The ""gay cowboy"" movie became so much more that what was expected. It has touched the hearts and souls of so many people. It has given people the idea that the love between two men can be just as powerful. Love is love, period.I am hoping Brokeback Mountain will sweep the Academy Awards in March. Best Picture, Actor, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress, Director. This movie has a special place in my heart now. Thank you everyone involved for give me this momentous experience. I owe you everything.",Brokeback Mountain
1501,velvetcowboy84,Heartbreaking and beautiful,10,30 October 2009,"This film took my breath away. The story is beautifully told, with deep sensitivity. The subject of two men who are in love with each other is handled with such respect and dignity that I am very impressed with this movie.When I first heard that Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger were playing the roles of the gay cowboys, I had my doubts. I wasn't sure that two straight guys would be able to portray these characters in an entirely accurate manner. But I definitely underestimated them. These two talented actors brilliantly represent the intense love between their characters. Without a doubt, this has instantly become one of my favourite movies. The film has a fantastic cast, and Ang Lee must be an excellent director to have been able to capture such searing emotions in a film. The Academy Award he won was certainly well-deserved. No film has ever moved me as deeply as ""Brokeback Mountain"".",Brokeback Mountain
1502,onno-8,Complex love-story,6,23 April 2006,"The reviews about this movie convinced me to see it, although I had some resistance that it might be just a gay-cowboy-movie in which I would not be so interested. When the story developed it became clear that this movie could not deliver what I was hoping for. Apart from that, I consider it to be a lot better as ""Million Dollar Baby"" from Clint Eastwood. Both movies are about USA-sensitive subjects, but Brokeback Mountain is more balanced and has a much deeper developed storyline.The first half of the movie is a bit disappointing as it does not show anything new and surprising. Half-way the movie the characters became more interesting as the complexity of their situations increased. This complexity is also, for my opinion, the most interesting thing about the movie. Although there is nothing wrong with this movie in the sense of ""Oscar-values"", for my opinion it is became a bit over-rated by it.",Brokeback Mountain

The cowboys are unconvincing and even less sympathetic, and the pace rarely rises above a lackadaisical trot. If it wasn't for a thirty-second turkey carving scene, in which one cowboy finally grows some stirrups, I would not have made it to the end, which came as a great relief, and saw me regretting the hours and money I'd invested in this tiresome effort. This was clearly a movie made to generate Oscar nominations, and if it wasn't for some nice scenery to distract the eye, I wouldn't have been able to keep them open.",Brokeback Mountain

You feel the loneliness, sadness, elation, of these characters in every frame of this film. It is not only about a male-male relationship, but in so many ways about relationships period...you see a relationship between two men, husbands and wives, fathers and daughters, husbands and in-laws...but yes, the center of it all is through the men's performances...Heath Ledger blew me away, and Jake Gyllenhall is now in a new level of acting... both of them should be nominated for Oscars..as well as Michelle Williams...in the last few frames, Anne Hathaway's very small part, became another ""jewel"" in this new favorite film of '05 to me....don't walk, run to see it...",Brokeback Mountain

My first action of the film when it were over was like ""this is what love is."" I have not read its short novel yet during I watch this movie and after that. I went brought me a copy of short story and actually read it. I think the character Ennis was more open toward Jack in the short story than in the movie. That was the one and only my big disappointment. However, Ang Lee did an excellent job of transported into a movie version. And the two lead actors did a wonderful job of it also.Beautiful script, great acting by both Heath and Jake, wonderful directing by Ang Lee. All adds up together created the Best 2005 Film Ever!!! Not bad at all. I like the movie despite the subject matter. When seeing the movie, I don't see gayness but all I'm seeing is 2 human souls are deeply in love with each other. And I am touched by that. If this movie were about a hereto-sexual couple(male & female), this would be another Titanic or Gone with the Wind movie.I wonder if I call this Brokeback Mountain movie the queer Titanic, Gone with the Wind, or Romeo and Juliet. Is that be okay? Don't misunderstanding me, I like the movie itself but this love tragic story is similar to Titanic or Gone with the Wind movie.",Brokeback Mountain
1506,ljames1514,"Creativity, Themes, Symbolism, Our Future",10,17 March 2010,"As an experiment in one of my courses, I chose to view ""Brokeback Mountain."" I like to start off by saying, don't be discouraged from watching this film. Through personal experiences, I for one felt uncomfortable. In all sincerity, I felt homosexuality was not the only theme. In many different levels, you can appreciate how this film reflects values and ideas, especially about gender roles, in our culture today. For example, you can appreciate the word ""queer"" and its association to words in a prideful context rather than shame, such as, odd, different, strange, ETC. In addition, the film defines masculinity in ways of physicality but not limited to. You can learn, as I did, that genders or gay relationships aren't absolutely without a doubt define nor are they the sole categories which define the diversity of human beings. Some of the scenes that stood our for me were the sheeps. Part of the two characters job was to herd sheeps, as well as anything required in the survival of the wilderness, i.e hunting, woodcutting, cooking. For me, the sheeps represented our obedience to our oppressors; You can expect this film to leave you with a recognition that straight relationships have privileges, such as, feeling that you're not judged and greater self worth. Lastly, I'm a fan of horror movies, but I found myself hooked. For reasons, such as, watching the internal battle of other human beings and seeing their transformation in becoming who they really are. If you want to see courage, inspiration, change, and a bromantic relationship, this enjoyable film is for you.",Brokeback Mountain
1507,vladviski,Shocking,10,2 April 2010,"This movie is one of those movies that you could watch over and over again without getting bored. It's an amazing story but, most of all, it's a tale about love. Even though the word 'love' is pronounced only once in the whole movie (and not in a relevant situation), you can feel it around; you also feel the suffering. But what was shocking to me about this movie is the fact that I was truly grateful for all the injustice and discrimination against gay people (myself being a gay individual as well), because out of this oppression great stories are created. It might sound crazy, but you get to that point that you share some sort of complicity with the characters and you realize that love is also created by simple moments.Now a SPOILER ALERT: It is amazing how Heath Ledger can transform a shirt in an alive part of the film, that makes you cry, that impresses you.",Brokeback Mountain
1508,petoir,"Powerful is an understatement, describing Brokeback Mountain",10,31 December 2005,"Totally overwhelmed by this film. Several friends, my partner and I went to see the movie last night at the 10:55pm show at the art movie theatre here in Cleveland - Cedar Lee Theatre. We were all tired and worried that we would fall asleep alas, this film grabbed us by the throat and kept all 7 of us enraptured by the quiet beauty and power of the story as it unfolded before our eyes. ALL of us were crying at the end - one had to run to the bathroom and bawl his eyes out.I was swept away by the acting - Heath Ledger deserves best Oscar for an actor this coming year, but all 4 leads, including Jake, Michelle and Anne were just as potent and believable. PERFECT casting! And Ang Lee has really shown that he can direct and handle any type of material presented to him.This is definitely not a 'gay cowboy' movie. It is a LOVE story through and through. People who dismiss this as not being the case are lost at what truly defines what love is and what happens when love is denied.In closing, it took me a 1/2 hour to fall asleep for the movie was running through my head; I dreamed about the movie and I woke up thinking about the movie - with key scenes running through my head. It has been a LONG time since I have been to a film where the power of the story hits you and hits you hard. I still get tears in my eyes just thinking back about the film.... The best movie of 2005 and one of the best movies of all time in my book.Cheers to Ang Lee for making a great short story into a fantastic film.Peter",Brokeback Mountain

Not to rehash all of the praise already given to this film, but Heath Ledger's and Jake Gyllenhaal's performance were perfection. We mustn't also forget Ang Lee's direction and his talent in creating such a great film. Often times, films that are so lauded by the media fail to live up to the initial hype. This is not one of those films, and in fact, I think it will become a classic love story. If people can get past the controversy surrounding this film and actually watch this for what it is, they too will just as touched as I have been.",Brokeback Mountain

When I first heard of the movie I had no expectations at all of it, but since I've already seen the movie 4 times in 2 weeks I surely admit that I really loved it,thats for sure. After the movie I looked on the other visitors and they all had the same expression on their face, sort of ""I-loved-this-movie-and-I-will-tell-everybody-about-it"" kind of face,it was lovely.I recommend this movie to everybody,see it, you'll be sorry if you don't!Lovely",Brokeback Mountain

This film is amazing. The cinematography is incredible, the landscapes gorgeous, and the characterizations beyond anything. I was blown away by the magnitude of this film, and I highly recommend this moving story. To just watch the development of the characters throughout the story was a journey in itself. Get prepared to cry your eyes out. Do not go to this film if you just want to see Jake/Heath (both of which, in my opinion, were very good)- go to this if you want to see a movie about the beauty of love and the nature of people.

1512,muscla_1,My long and winding road up Brokeback Mountain,10,10 February 2006,"There was so much hype around this film, but I was pre-hyped as it was.I read the short story in a doctor's office waiting room in The New Yorker back in late '97. I'd read ""The Shipping News,"" which was OK, and as I had a long wait I thought I'd check out this story.I immediately fell in love with the language, and when things took, shall we say, an unexpected turn, it got a whole hell of a lot more interesting.I finished the story totally stunned, then started sobbing. Not tearing up, I was completely undone. Just at that moment the nurse came out to get me to see the doctor, and asked me what was wrong. I could barely talk, so I pointed at the magazine and said ""Good story."" She laughed and said ""Brokeback Mountain, huh? You're the third one this week."" I thought ""Wow, that would make an amazing movie. Too bad it'll never happen."" I read the anthology when it came out; I loved the prologue Proulx added. I continued to read it over the next five years, and heard rumblings that the movie was going to be made by Gus Van Sandt. I thought ""Oh, no, not another Private Idaho. Wrong for the material."" Schumacher would have been even worse. Then I heard about Ang Lee. SCORE! Perfect for this film, which was to star...Donnie Darko Jake Gyllenhaal and ""pretty boy"" Heath Ledger? Say it ain't so! I consoled myself that Ledger had been really good in ""Monster's Ball.""I barely breathed until the film had wrapped production, then heard the accolades, the critics buzz, the anticipation was killing me.Finally it was December 9th, I saw it on that first weekend. As the lights went down, I thought ""I can't believe it's finally here. Hope to God it's good."" The film exceeded my expectations. First, Heath Ledger was not only good, he completely and totally BECOMES Ennis Del Mar in a way I don't think I'd seen since Daniel Day Lewis in ""My Left Foot."" It's a career-defining performance, and he carries the entire film on his broad shoulders. Second, Ang Lee. What a master, what a FREAKING master. The deliberate pacing and layers upon layers of meaning draws you completely in, then kicks you in the guts. Third, of course, is Jake Gyllenhaal. I was so blown away by Ledger the first time that I really didn't notice how fine Gyllenhaal was until the second viewing. His outgoing Jack is the perfect foil to the island of stoicism that is Ennis. Their chemistry is palpable, and their love is believable, total, and ultimately tragic. The rest of the cast is equally solid, particularly the long-suffering wives. Gorgeous camera-work in the mountains of Alberta and a haunting score round out this incredible film.Beware, this film gets under your skin and stays there a long time. I cried at the end, then had to compose myself for 20 minutes in the car so that I could drive home. That night in the shower, it hit me again. Then again at work the next day. I saw it again, and it just deepened, and my respect for this film just continued to grow. On the surface it seems a simple love story, but there is much symbolic and cinematic complexity below the surface. Finally, it continues to pack an emotional wallop that just won't let you go.I am NOT normally an emotional man, I rarely if ever cry, but this film just does it to me. Love IS a force of nature.I'm going to a screening in a few days that has a Q&A with Ang Lee, the cast, and the composer, and I'm going to first thank them for one of the most amazing films I've ever seen.Brokeback's got me good. 10 out of 10.",Brokeback Mountain
1513,littlesilvercat,You'll be bored to tears.,3,23 August 2006,"I think the main problem with this film is that it relies too heavily on the sensitivity of the audience. If you aren't of a sympathetic or overly emotional disposition, then this film simply isn't for you. It just isn't engaging enough. For the most part the two main characters are bland, generally unlikeable and certainly not empathetic. Their relationship seems to be based around sex (though it's sometimes the only clue they're even together, given how little either character emotes), and in carrying on with their relationship cheat on their wives, skip out on their children and generally show complete disregard for everyone else's feelings. Even this isn't climatic, or eventful. It just happens, matter of factly, throughout the tediously long 19 year storyline. Perhaps the lack of eventfulness is supposed to be subtle and poignant, but it just comes across as tiresome and incomplete. In the end, a film is a narrative device, and Brokeback Mountain just doesn't utilise it as it could have done.",Brokeback Mountain
1514,vk28,Influence of the Director's Background,10,19 March 2011,"I have read comments by some who say that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a slow and boring film with little ""action"". That is very much not the case. Rather, those comments may reflect the views of people who may not be aware or appreciate some of the texture associated with Asian dramatic films. However strange it may sound, ""Brokeback Mountain"" can be considered an ""Asian"" film.As a Chinese film director who was born in Taiwan, Ang Lee's Chineseness shows through in his movies. This is true in ""Brokeback Mountain."" Even though, in many ways, the film seems distinctly un-Chinese, focusing on the gay relationship between two cowboys in the rugged American West. But the movie also has themes popular in Chinese cinema, like the repression of the true self in a conservative society. Movie buffs familiar with Chinese film will also note how ""Brokeback Mountain"" is rich in understated communication that's popular in Asian movies. There's the subtle, incremental buildup to the cowboys' love affair -- fleeting glances fraught with subsumed passion, minute gestures of heart-wrenching tenderness. In particular, Ang has employed metaphoric allusions, subtle, nuanced facial and physical expressions or vocal inflections (e.g., an eyebrow raised, a stolen glance, a longing look, or avoidance of eye contact hiding behind hats, a lingering touch, or a pregnant pause) to convey unsaid or unsay-able thoughts or emotions as a projection of repression.Even though unsaid or conveyed indirectly, an observant viewer will understand completely the emotions and feelings that are being communicated. That is why this film needs to be viewed more than once. As many viewers have noticed and commented, one gains deeper appreciation of the story and the details of the matrix of relationships between and among the principal characters - Jack, Ennis, Alma, and Lureen - and those around them through the many layers and subtle details of this film. Hence, if one looks more closely one will see much more than meets the eye initially.To quote William Leung: Ang Lee is ""a literalist who favors the adaptation of literary fictions, and invariably he stays faithful to his source material. On top of this, Lee's approach to filmmaking is conspicuously un-postmodernist, being character-plot oriented rather than style-polemic oriented. Lee favors a traditional humanist and social-realist approach to storytelling, so much so that to describe him as a classical filmmaker would strike most people as apt.""

1515,kuemer01,Two cowboys with feelings for each other.,7,22 March 2011,"Brokeback Mountain is a story about two young who during a summer job as sheep herders find themselves starting a relationship. The leading roles in the film are Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist, Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar, Ann Hathaway as Laureen Newsome, and Michelle Williams as Alma Beers.It is a story of homosexuality and loneliness in the 60's and 70's. It takes a raw and uncut look into the lives of men in the poor western countryside.The two main characters Jack and Ennis find that they have similar backgrounds; both are high school dropouts from poor ranch families. Jack's dad was cold, while Ennis's father and mother were gone from his life at a very young age. The story began in the summer of 1963 on Brokeback Mountain where both men worked herding the sheep. They became very close on that mountain; even though Ennis was afraid of the sexual relationship. As a boy he was witness to a brutal beating of a man who was believed to have a relationship with another man he lived with.Both men returned to their lives after that summer. Ennis went home to his soon to be wife Alma, and two daughters. In the meantime Jack moved on to Texas to pursue his career in bull riding; which is where he found his soon to be wife, Laureen. Shortly after meeting Laureen, Jack and she had a son. Laureen's father owned a farm machinery sales company, so once in the family he no longer struggled for money or work. Ennis still struggled to find work as a cowboy. Meanwhile the two men would meet for so called ""fishing trips"". Alma seen the two men in a loving embrace by accident and their marriage was never the same. They soon got a divorce. They carried on their secret relationship for years until Jack died.The film quality is rough; as to show the purity or innocence of the film. The lighting was mainly dim and dark; this showed the poorness and dessert surroundings. Even the store that Alma worked in was dark. The only bright scenes were the outdoor scenes with natural sunlight.Camera angles in the film varied. There were wide shots to capture the beauty of the mountains and the isolation of Ennis's home. You also seen many close up's of the characters to help you understand their emotions at the time, especially while they cried. You see Jack and Ennis fight their desires for each other inside the tent on Brokeback Mountain by the look of longing in their eyes. Most of the cries were silent, but with tear-filled eyes. None of the characters seemed to be able to show great sadness. It just proves that this film is all about loneliness. You could see this in Alma when she caught them embracing, or in the end when Ennis found out about the death of Jake. None of the characters portrayed were very emotionally fulfilled with their lives. It was like they all kept it inside.Jacks character is a free spirit willing to try a real relationship with Ennis on a ranch of their own. Ennis character is a deeper emotionally detached man, with isolation issues who believes the relationship could never work.",Brokeback Mountain
1516,weasel_1733,Undesired Love,6,19 May 2011,"Brokeback Mountain is a story of forbidden and even sometimes an undesired love between two cowboys. Given the right set of circumstances anyone can fall in love with even the most unspeakable partner. The main protagonist is Ennis Del Mar played by Heath Ledger is a cowboy who is familiar with working on a ranch. The antagonist is Jack Twist played by Jake Gyllenhaal who is less experienced in the real workings of a cowboy but aspires to exceed in the rodeo. Ennis has an old fashioned name and is unique giving significance as the main character. His accent is strong and he is slower and quieter than Jack. He is given the characteristics of an average man in these times given their location of Wyoming. Jack has a common name giving him less meaning as only a supporting actor. He is outspoken and more flamboyant associating him with a gay man in America. His speech is clearer and better educated giving him the advantage that intelligence has to manipulate Ennis. This unorthodox love affair begins on Brokeback Mountain in Wyoming. This middle of nowhere setting allows the characters to express feelings and actions that would not have necessarily even emerged in the view of the public eye. The plot takes a twist once this private love affair becomes exposed, at least to Ennis's wife.This film is shot from the viewer's perspective focusing on the life of Ennis. The camera does a good job of capturing the majestic and even sometimes romantic scenery. The music also adds to this effect of the mountainous terrain. The lack of music at pivotal points in the film allows the viewer to focus on the characters and the actions taking place. The camera angles allow us to see Jack's sexual interest in Ennis from the beginning scenes of the movie. The cinematography is clear about its depiction of Jack as a homosexual man who is pursuing Ennis a clearly heterosexual man. A specific set of circumstances allows Jack to take advantage and seduce Ennis into a relationship that was undesired in the beginning. Once the love is there it can't be taken back and even though Ennis doesn't need the comfort of a man like Jack does he can't fight the way he feels towards the man he loves.",Brokeback Mountain

Ernnis in particular had been exposed to violent hate crimes against gays. For fear of being found out the two go their separate ways when their job is done. By no coincidence they run into each other again and their relationship begins to get dangerously serious. The two men lead separate lives away from the mountain with wives and children but each struggle to accept the truth of his sexuality. Ernnis especially seems to have a hard time concealing his true feelings from his wife. While Jack is no stranger to homosexual promiscuity he realizes a bond with Ernnis that he can not get with any other person. Ernnis is a masculine character that expresses anger and avoidance of the topic of homosexuality except when he is on the mountain with Jack. Jack is a transparent character who wears his heart on his sleeve, because of his experience with gay relationships it appears easier for him to hide his sexuality from everyone around him. The mountain begins to serve as a metaphor for the relationship that the two men can never really have, a place to visit but never stay.

1518,alaina188,One of 2005's greatest,9,19 May 2011,"One of greatest films to come out of 2005 leaving audiences in awe and appreciation would be the three time academy award winning masterpiece known as Brokeback Mountain. This drama/romance follows the lives of two young adults who suddenly begin a physical relationship while working at an isolated location for one summer during the year of 1963. Ennis Del Mar, played by Heath Ledger, and Jack Twist, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, learn to deal with their newly formed relationship while being thrown back into their usual life after their summer of working together ends. The film depicts the emotional journey that each character embarks and highlights significant moments of their lives apart over a twenty year gap.Both Ennis and Jack come from very different home lives in the state of Wyoming but still represent their western charm after taking up a summer of hard labor to support themselves. They spend each day caring for sheep among the cold nights while still finding time to relax and become one with the beautiful openness of Brokeback Mountain. Ennis and Jack slowly begin to open up to each other, usually at the nighttime after a hard days work, telling stories of their childhood and their dreams. It is evident from the beginning that Jack may in fact find Ennis to be desirable and that comes to be the truth after a heavy night of downing whiskey when Jack makes a move on Ennis. The immediate shock of this interaction leaves Ennis to get angry but Ennis soon gives in to his advances after they both feel comfortable enough to sleep together in the tent during a cold, rainy evening. Their first physical interaction is shot with the point of view from Ennis, clearly showing his battle with wanting something that he knows may in fact be wrong. This portrays one of the major themes throughout the film.Because the film begins in 1963, when both characters are relatively young, and ends in the mid 1980s, a lot of activity and emotions are presented. Both characters soon go on to marry and have children which is portrayed in a way of nothing but stress and confusion that eventually leads to a large amount of strain on both of their marriages. It is not until four years after their goodbye that Jack visits Ennis which leads to a memorable, passionate kiss outside his apartment. Ennis's wife accidentally views this from the front door which also begins her first moments of wanting to flee from their once perfect marriage. They soon divorce leading Jack to believe that Ennis has finally made his mind up about what he wants out of life but Ennis makes it clear to him that they cannot have a life together. Their relationship continues to go from up and down, with little interaction here and there, but still resorting back to saying goodbye leaving both of them in a confused state. Their overall relationship is amplified by a quiet, almost sad, guitar stringing followed by old-fashion country music to light up the dramatics behind their goodbyes. They both lead purposeful lives but are clearly not as happy as they should be. Jack continues to make a point that they could have had a life together, fishing and living in a cabin by the woods, living on nothing but love. Unfortunately, during this time, societies negative opinion on gay relationships causes Ennis to disregard any type of structured love. Brokeback Mountain is truly a love story back dropped against drama, strength, sorrow and lust; all things that make a powerful love story.",Brokeback Mountain
1519,HeyJuwannaMan,You've got to be joking.,1,8 February 2006,"I just went to go see ""Brokeback Mountain"" last weekend after hearing over and over how great it was. I was actually excited to see a great film!! However, as I walked out of that film I was angry, not disappointed or sad, but angry. Here's why: 1.) Should have been called ""Mumble Mountain"" as it was close to impossible to understand what was being said. The theatre I saw this at actually had to switch the sound from Dolby 5.1 Digital to MONO!!! 2.) Hands down the worst acting I have seen this year. Every emotion seemed forced and overly dramatic, especially for these cowboys. Granted, Heath Ledger wasn't THAT bad, I'd give his acting a 6/10.3.) Over the span of 20-23 years, these cowboys didn't age more than a couple of days. I was absolutely floored as to why these cowboys, who are supposedly living rough and tough lives didn't age!!! At the end, Heath Ledger's eldest daughter looked MUCH older than he did. I can't fathom how Ang Lee let this huge detail go overlooked.4.) The straight-gay-straight-gay-straight dynamic was just flat-out boring. Through the middle of the film, 40 minutes were taken up just by the husbands and wives saying goodbye to each other as the guys went to meet up on Brokeback every couple of months.5.) The scenery was pretty 6.)

1520,hbee23,A Universal Story of Love and Pain,9,19 June 2011,"Brokeback Mountain is a story of universal love and pain. Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist and Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar, play two individuals who fall unexpectedly in love. The time is 1963 Wyoming, and this film shows us that love can live against all odds. Both men know that they aren't going to be able to be together anywhere but on Brokeback. The mountain then becomes a symbol of what they share together and the love that they hold for each other. It separates them from the plains that stand to represent the resentment and hatred that they fear.When Ennis was young, his father showed him the dead body of a farmer who was suspected of being gay, and was told of the terrible things that were done to him. This stuck with him. Since he never strayed far from home, he is unable to break away from his upbringing and the conservatism. Jack, on the other hand, travels to Mexico and suggests this alternative to Ennis. Regardless of the situation, Jack and Ennis are unable to give up on this love they have for each other. As Jack tells Ennis after a fight ""I wish I knew how to quit you."" The movie is similar to Titanic in its theme. Being from different social classes, the two main characters must sneak around together, but ultimately, their love survives through all odds. The part of Brokeback Mountain that makes it so great is that the characters represent more than just two men in love. They symbolize any kind of forbidden love, whether it be two people of different ethnicities, two different social statuses, two different religions, or in this case, two individuals of the same sex.The editing of the film shows a lot of outside/in and inside/out transitions. When the men are on Brokeback, the camera shows you the vast mountainside, and then zooms in to the more specific action that is going on. This allows you to feel how desolate and secluded they are. This sense of safety and freedom allows them to comfortably act on their love and emotion that they would not be able to do outside in conservative 1963 Wyoming.This film will be one to be shared for generations to come. Heath Ledger's performance was not only compelling and powerful; it broke a new topic onto the main screen and showed you about true love and how powerful that can be.",Brokeback Mountain
1521,prophe02,Ang Lee made a movie that will never be forgotten.,8,18 June 2011,"Ang Lee made a movie that will never be forgotten. Brokeback Mountain is a love story between two cowboys Heath Ledger (Enis) and Jake Gyllenhaal (Jack). This film opens your eyes and I will admit I pass judgment until I actually viewed the film. Jack and Ennis had agreed that no one would know about their relationship because they could end up dead if someone found out. One cold night in a tent was all it took to spark the relationship up between the two sheep herders. The film took a little while to develop it was a long drawn out herding scene. They both got married and still seen each other often on fishing trips. The marriages were a big lie because they were in a secret relationship. The love story in this film reminds me of the titanic in the love that they had for each other. The theme of Brokeback Mountain is the overwhelming force of love between two people. No matter what Jack and Enis had going they would always find time to meet over a twenty year span. They both had their own families and also had their secret life. The media looks at this film as a ""gay cowboys"" and this movie is not all that bad. This movie really did have the potential of going south real quick because the guys do not want to see a movie about gay cowboys. The camera angles were perfect in this film. The angles had the viewer's right in the action. When the guys were at the campfire it felt like we were sitting on a long right beside them. The angle showed the beautiful scenery on the mountain. It was nice green grass and a beautiful blue sky a perfect view. The other contributing factor was the sound effect. At the campfire you could hear the wood crackling from the wood and that made you feel really involved in the film. While on the mountain it was a soft guitar music play that kind of set the mood for the film and it was a nice mellow tune. Another good example was when the little girls were swings the squeaking from the swings sounded like you could have been right there pushing them. I was a skeptic against Brokeback and I said I would never watch it, but it is a pretty good film to watch.",Brokeback Mountain
1522,damo_zamo,they come carrying cards..,4,14 February 2006,"I wanted to see this movie before pre-judging it as a 'gay cowboy' movie. But from what I have seen, it takes any 'normal' issues and distorts it into something else. Any man with feelings is a homo.. any guys that are friends must be gay.. anyone who marries, all a normal man can look forward to is a 'mediocre' wife and family.. the song in the bar scene with the young woman typifies this attitude 'its so easy falling in love' moral of the story, gay is good - and normal values are wrong. all in all.. a card carrying 'gay' movie.I see it as less of a story about lovers beyond gender as one of betrayal, one of perversion, one where the lives of normal men are seen as mediocre compared to the purity of a gay relationship.However, this could have been the pre-judgment i got from the card carrying 'gay club'. still, just didn't buy this movie",Brokeback Mountain

Problem is, the story spans 2 decades, and in trying to cover the time period, Lee doesn't take enough time to develop characters, relationships or situations. So at no point do you care about the people on the screen. Add to this Lee's tendency to avoid any clarification of plot, leaving the viewer to fill in huge blanks, the long silences and endless brooding looks and what dialogue there is being muttered inaudibly and you are left with a boring soulless film. The only actor to come out with any real credit is Anne Hathaway playing well against type.

I have been back to observe the film and his performance 9 times. He has the mastery in every scene he is in to have some emotion spill out of his eyes, his mouth, his extra throat clearing and breathing sounds. He makes you experience the emotion of the scene as if it was his life log moment. I have just completed a noir-romantic script about two young men who can't love and live with one another or without one another which finds them in a bizarre dance of killings.

It will be the prestige pic to beat this O season, and the one most talked about in the current societal climate. Opened in limited release this weekend, and that's the smartest thing the distributor could have done. A news crew was filming the box office while I was buying my tickets. The cashier was saying ""this was one of the last two performances with available tickets FOR THE NEXT WEEK!"" (and this is in cowboy-macho Dallas).

BUT not in the case of ""Brokeback Mountain"". Not since ""Lord Of the Rings"" has the quality of the movie EXCEEDED my expectations.For once a movie conveys the depth and legitimacy of homosexual LOVE. And what surprises me as much as the movie has, is the reactions by heterosexuals who have seen it. I'm amazed by the sheer number of positive feedback from them! They're not seeing this movie as a gay cowboy movie, but for what it really is. An incredible story. An incredible love story. TSK",Brokeback Mountain

Never have I seen a movie that endeared me to the nature of emotions and what I saw as a true love story. I will for sure be owning it on DVD as soon as it comes out. It will be one of the movies that I watch over and over. Anything that I missed on my first viewing, I will pick up when I watch it a second time.

1528,Shaunhyland05,Beautiful film wrong story,7,31 December 2005,"I truly wish I could be singing the praises of this film. But it's the wrong film, the wrong message, the promotion of an image that needs to pass from our culture.I've grown weary of the message that because people are different, they are pitiable and must be consigned to a life of tragedy. In mainstream films with gay subject matter, the homosexual in question either winds up dead or crazy,or both. (The Talented Mr. Ripley, American Beauty, the list goes on) This is a beautiful love story, yes. It was a wonderfully written short story I stumbled on several years ago by Annie Proulx, and the screenplay has Larry McMurtry's masterful fingerprints all over it. I've no truck with Proulx, McMurtry, or Osanna. I have no issue with Ang Lee who made a beautiful film. Nor do I have issue with the talented cast who gave us wonderfully crafted performances.My issue is with the pathetic notion that people are less than because they are different, that they must be denied happiness just because of who they love. I've listened to it for almost 50 years and it's not true. Does this kind of story happen? Sure! All the time. Is it the byproduct of a culture afraid of its own sexual shadow? Yes. Is it the byproduct of a culture that would rather let its children see people being blown to bits rather than loving each other? Sadly,yes.Where is the film in which Ennis Del Mar has courage? The film in which Jack and Ennis win? Stop telling people that their sexual orientation determines their worth in this culture from the time they're born. Tell them they are valued regardless of who they are. Show me that! Celebrate that! That I'll sing the praises of. That I'll pay ten bucks to see. All that's been done here is someone has put attractive people in beautiful settings, and promoted an empty myth.",Brokeback Mountain
1529,triznad,not worth paying $10 to see,5,9 January 2006,"I can't say that I would recommend seeing this movie. The acting was average, not excellent. The scenery and locations work was excellent in the film. Ang Lee did a good enough job directing the movie. The problem lies within the story. The story quite simply unfolded too slowly. The first third of the movie dragged on too long and the dialog between the main characters left me bored and I almost left at that point. I simply did not care about the characters at all because by the time things picked up I was completely unattached from the movie. The unfortunate part about this movie will be when awards season comes around. The only reason I think this movie will win awards is because of the homosexual theme in the movie. There will be pressure to vote for this movie because of the topic when in reality the acting and script was simply average. Not worth wasting $10 on. I would recommend Munich instead.",Brokeback Mountain

First of all the acting, very praised by critics, wasn't such good, they were unconvincing, I didn't feel any sympathy for the cowboys or their love story which is truly cliché and unrealistic. The love scene wasn't romantic at all it was just violent and scary, it was like a rape attend, I couldn't watch it. The plot was BORING, I passed the entire time to wait for something happen, but it didn't! I was hopeful to see something which gonna hold my interest, but it was more like a torture than an art movie. So everybody should watch it, to see how a few critics and awards can make of an average movie a classic of its kind.",Brokeback Mountain

At some points I was expecting more, but now, after looking back on the movie as a whole, it seems perfect. There are extremely beautiful moments, and the acting is both raw and touching throughout. It took me a good 2 days to feel normal again after watching this movie, and as soon as I could I went out and bought the short story. It makes you feel, and it makes you ache - as beautiful as it was I wouldn't call it a pleasant experience - but most of all it makes you think about loss, about denial, and about truly finding happiness, whatever form it takes.

I really felt for the characters and you showed the world what I and many have to live every day of our lives. I hope Hollywood and the Academy Awards fill the same.

It did not matter about gay or not gay, this was a love story. It reminded me of ""Same Time Next Year"" with Alan Alda; but of course their love was different in the sense that those characters were straight. But, for two people to have to go to such extremes to have to see each other for their ""fishing/hunting"" trips, and then for Jack to die and seeing Ennis almost break down when his friend/lover dies (or murdered possibly in Ennis' mind) just kills me. This movie was a LOVE STORY, not a ""homo"" story. The only sex scene was in the beginning of their relationship sexually. Unfortunately, I have too many friends who are too ""homophobic"" to enjoy this movie. It is a wonderful love story, homosexual or not.

1534,mstrong76,Must see for ANYONE,9,1 January 2006,"I have read the good reviews and I have read the bad. Most of all that's important though is that I have seen the movie and loved it. I saw this movie in the 3'd tier cities that were granted ONE theater in which the whole state must commute to watch it which was surprising as to our mostly liberal culture here. I went 3 days after the premier in my city of Milwaukee, WI to a 1pm matinée that was SOLD OUT. As a gay man myself I was very surprised at the diverse (mostly str8) crowd that attended.This movie has proved itself to be of the legendary romance stories that drives culture to improve upon itself. I may appear biased for my sexuality, but I am in no way someone whom bandwagons on something because it's ""cool"". This film is simply perfection of direction and material and acting that I have a hard time finding in recent years. If everyone dares to watch this brilliant film it's truly a group think changing event in itself.I didn't ever have an affinity for Ledger before seeing this film, but his performance was so realistic and warm that I just want to see it again. All of the characters are done so well that you feel like you are missing a good friend that you want to still hang out with after it's over.You will love it if you have a brain and are comfortable with your sexuality.",Brokeback Mountain

I know a few people who refuse to go see a ""gay cowboy"" film. Trust me, you are missing out. It's not at all sentimental, or preachy, it's not a tear jerker, it's just about two souls in love with each other. These type of films are pretty rare and they kind of grow on you. The more you think about this movie(and trust me, you will) the more you like and understand it. It's very well acted. A bit hard to understand the words, since the actors are kind of mumbling throughout the film, but none the less this is a very moving film, and it's been hunting me for 3 days now. I can't stop thinking about it. Thank you everyone involved with this project for such a great experience.",Brokeback Mountain
1536,meryl_88,A Rare Film,10,7 February 2006,"What a great film: spare and unsparing, bleak and rich, beautiful and ugly, but most of all truthful. Ang Lee has done an outstanding job of adapting the Annie Proulx story, one that retains the qualities that make that story so moving.There's been a lot of speculation about how people are going to take this story, but if they stay away out of prejudice or fear, that's their loss. They will miss the chance to see and feel what it's like to love someone and not be able to be with them; to have permission to exist, but not to be really alive. There are plenty of movies about men and women who suffer this fate through one circumstance or another. This is something rare, and it's done without preaching or rationalizations. It's just what happens to two men, and you watch them handle it as best they can.The actors are wonderful, and I give Ang Lee credit here, too, for creating an atmosphere that allowed them do this kind of work. The two leads could have been perhaps less handsome and more rawboned, but Heath Ledger's eyes tell you everything you need to know about how much Ennis has been hurt in his life, and Jake Gyllenhaal's body language is all vulnerability and yearning. You come to feel their frustrations and hurt right along with them as they try to manage a kind of furtive marriage over a period of twenty years.The supporting players look like they were picked up from the very roads of Wyoming. Randy Quaid as the sheep owner and Roberta Maxwell as Jack's mother were my favorites, but the women who played the wives were also very good. It was nice to see Anne Hathaway get a chance to do something other than fluff, and Michelle Williams did a great job of showing how hard it was to keep swallowing her resentment and anger. The landscapes are vast, empty and beautiful, and the little towns and ranches are just as weather-beaten, dust-laden, dirt-poor and isolated as the people who live there.Ultimately I envy Ennis and Jack, for all their troubles. They do find real love, and it means so much to them that they pay a hard price to keep it. They know what really counts.",Brokeback Mountain

1540,bloommaster,"stunning, hauntingly beautiful, pretty much says it all",10,23 January 2006,"I have noticed that several people have questioned as to whether Jack and Ennis really loved each other and have indicated that they feel their relationship seemed to be based on sex. I would remind them that these are people who do not express emotion of any kind verbally and that a lot of people are not going to be used to the way things are expressed between men in the emotionally repressed Rocky Mountain West.Bearing in mind that the words ""I love you"" are never used in this film, which is typical of the people depicted within it, let me point out some scenes where that deep and profound love is shown if you just look for it:1. In the flash back where Jack is sleeping on his feet and Ennis comes up and embraces him from behind and tells him it is time for him to go to bed is an incredibly tender moment. When Jack turns and watches Ennis ride away, the love in Jacks eyes is just breath taking.2. On the lake shore during their final confrontation Jack tells Ennis that he ""wished he knew how to quit him"". The incredible agony that pours from Ennis as he collapses to the ground and Jack enfolds him in his arms portrays a frustrated love so deep, so profound that words simply cannot do it justice.3. The two shirts, which Jack had lovingly placed one inside the other was simply Jack's sweet, quiet way of saying ""I love you Ennis del Mar"". Ennis's wonderfully tender way of bringing the shirts to his face when he found them was his quiet way of saying ""I love you Jack Twist"".4. In the final scene of the film Ennis adjusts the collars of the shirts and says with his eyes full of tears; ""Jack, I swear"". It is an act, an expression of love again so deep it simply defies description.No love? NEVER have I seen so much love pass between two human beings in my life.",Brokeback Mountain

The only characters I really sympathised with were the wives Ledger and Gyenhaal's characters and the parents at the end.It's essentially a movie in which Ang Lee attempts to glorify, or at least excuse, dishonesty and infidelity on a grand scale. The scripting and dialogue was dull, the plot was vapid and uninspired, and none of the scenes really flowed. The sex scene was nothing short of ridiculous - what was with those idiotic grunts? And why did they have to beat each other up just to make out? Because they were BIG TOUGH COWBOY men? Ridiculous.Even the soundtrack was a letdown. The only thing I particularly enjoyed about this movie was the cinematography - the visuals were excellent, and some of the pans and tracking shots were excellent. But a movie being ""pretty"" isn't enough of a reason to watch it.Anyways, in summary, don't watch Brokeback Mountain. It's the year's biggest stinker and we're still in January.",Brokeback Mountain

The whole cast was outstanding.My wish is for people to go see this movie and not get caught up in the whole ""gay rights"" issue, but to really see what is at the heart of the movie. Also, those of you that are worried about the sex scene between ""Jack & Ennis"" should not be worried.

It's great to see a gay movie that doesn't involve dance music, gay lisps, and endless promiscuity. However, the movie was way too long, and talk about melodrama! It seems like every other scene had to involve people breaking down with emotion, which is not necessarily a bad thing (I guess that's why they call it a love story). But, after a while, the emotional scenes gets to be a bit repetitive and, sadly, predictable. If you like that and melodrama, then you'd probably like this film. Another thing: spanning the film over such a long period of time (20+ years of the characters' lives) was a bit distracting. As a result, the film felt a bit unfocused. To sum: I wouldn't say this movie was bad, but it wasn't great. The film had the potential of being innovative, but ends up being just another artificially inflated emotional love story that we've all seen before (minus the gay cowboys).",Brokeback Mountain

I don't know what the rules are for judging the BAFTAS, but to me a film that no one here has seen should not be eligible. Or am I just been biased because I think Heath Ledger gave the best performance anyone could possibly give? I feel that the recent awards have given BBM the statues for Best Film and Best Director, which is great, but are missing who the real star is - Heath Ledger.

It is tragic that most of America will never see this movie simply because it is a homosexual love story. Brokeback Mountain is the best love story I have ever seen though. I am not a cryer in movies but this broke my heart. It is so much more than two gay cowboys. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal convey true love and passion over years and many obstacles. I want to find a love like that. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway were simply perfect as their wives; I felt their pain and anguish in their short roles. Ang Lee did beautifully in his direction. I felt like I was at Brokeback Mountain. The scenery itself was romantic. The shots definitely revealed true character traits. I absolutely adore this movie and I recommend it to everyone.

But, the build-up to the main players' first sexual encounter was simply not in keeping with how the story had been playing out to that point. There were a few moments when their eyes met, but there was no sense that anything was building up between the two of them. Then: wham, bam, thank you man! After which they both stated that they weren't gay.The clarity of the diction was appalling (people do watch films outside of the USA!) and if I had been watching this in a cinema I would have missed around 20% of the dialogue.

Put a girl in one of their parts and the movie becomes a whole lot less interesting. This is a problem, especially when the film's supporters act like the love between the two characters is more important than their genders. Basically, the movie is about two lovers who cannot be together because of social standards. That's not an original plot, and I don't even think their love is developed as well as it could have been. Other movies do it better.Overall, Brokeback is certainly a rather good movie. I just don't think it's amazing.",Brokeback Mountain
1548,chefjudy,Awesome in every way.......,10,8 January 2006,"I see (and have seen) probably hundreds of movies, but few touch the heart as Brokeback Mountain does. On the surface it is the story of two men who meet and fall in love. Fair enough, but the story and direction of Ang Lee draw you in and you find yourself actually wanting for these two guys to live out their lives together, even if conventional society at the time says they must keep it a secret. This is a movie that will haunt you long after you have left the theater. You will never forget the tenderness and emotions that make this such a wonderful film; all of the actors are first rate. As for the leads, I could not imagine any other young Hollywood men who could have played these parts as well as Heath and Jake - both were a revelation in their respective character. Other points of excellence include the story, cinematography and especially, the soundtrack which was incredible all by itself. A definite must-see for those to whom film is an art, as well as entertainment.edited to add: I saw the movie again yesterday and it was even better on a second viewing. Even though I already knew what happens, the tears flowed almost constantly, and I found myself hearing and seeing aspects that I overlooked the first time. I can't put this into words, but I was more touched and more drawn to the characters on my second visit. Apparently I am not alone in my reaction - there are many others who are saying much the same thing.

Like these films before it, Brokeback was great because it was different, and, in its own way, revolutionary. It felt IMPORTANT in a way few films do. History has taught us that The Academy isn't always right, and this is one of those times it got it wrong.Brokeback has made an indelible impression on our society. It has brought to the surface a conversation that is often conspicuously absent from our collective dialogue. Whether you wanted to know or not, you've got to admit that you heard a lot about the film. It was everywhere: the TV news, newspaper articles, late night talk show monologues; even President Bush couldn't escape being asked about it. It was hard to go anywhere without hearing some comment about gay cowboys.Take heart in the film's power to move people in a significant way, one way or the other. It rings true, and for some people that was a little scary. It seems to me that that is the best possible judge of a film's greatness. Ang Lee and his cast were able to truly capture the essence of Ennis and Jack, and the characters they created are destined to become landmarks of American cinema. For those who appreciated it, the film meant far more than Crash's superficial stylishness ever could. No statue changes that.",Brokeback Mountain
1550,jeff_wilson_48103,haunting and challenging,10,18 December 2005,"As a gay man in my mid 30's, I was a little fearful of the hype surrounding the release of this movie, as I had read Annie Proulx's story in the New Yorker on its release in 1997. Her representation of Ennis DelMar and Jack Twist's love transcends gay versus straight and is clearly a story of unfulfilled love and the consequences that result as a choice of not following one's heart. There has not been a story that has challenged my thinking about love and relationships more than this one, especially after seeing Ang Lee's true to the sparse nature of the written word and Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhall and Michelle Williams outstanding (while extremely understated) acting. After reading the story, I knew exactly when I would break down and sob, even though I wished the story would end differently. The pain and sorrow in this movie (especially in Jake Gyllenhall's portrayal) is palpable, the commitment to the truth is clear and the ability of Heath Ledger to capture the longing that Ennis felt in the story was amazing. In a scene with no words, Heath showed the longing, grief and commitment that Ennis felt, while knowing that Jack felt the same. I will buy this movie, I will see it a thousand times, and I will cry in the same spot every time. Bravo all.",Brokeback Mountain

I cried as never before......... Just a great movie about love. I love the Jack Twist character. When Ennis goes to visit his family after his death I could not stop crying. Jack's mother shows all the love and understanding that any mother can give, it's so powerful. I don't mind if the movie gets some Oscars. I know is a great movie for me and I hope it would be also helpful for a lot of people out there. It just shows that love is the best feeling, the same for gay than for straight people. We all love it and we all suffer because of it. Terrific movie. Congratulations Ang Lee!",Brokeback Mountain
1552,chris-murray3,No Good,1,18 January 2006,"This has got to be one of the most disappointing drama films I have seen ever... This film has funny moments and some emotional scenes, it is just I feel this movie disappointed me on a dramatic level. The characters seem to be cold and emotionless. I don't know if this is the intention of the actors, but in real life when you learn somebody you care about has died horrifically, you would not be able to carry on speaking. No offence, but I felt no sympathy for Heath Ledger as he appeared to be so cold, whilst in contrast the rest of the cast seemed more sympathetic. This film was not emotional enough to win any awards. I think this has got to be the most over-rated film up for the Oscars. Overall this movie needed more emotional scenes, more sympathetic characters, a faster pace, less nudity and more scenes spent on character. I give this a 5/10, not very good at all.",Brokeback Mountain

I'm neither a gay rights advocate nor a homophobe. I'm just a straight guy who believes in living and letting live. BBM was a sad movie about loss and denial and not being true to oneself and suffering the consequences and not being able to get what you really want and feeling pain and hurting others intentionally or unintentionally. That's all. It was about life. I'm feeling bad right now - not because the Academy snubbed this ""gay movie,"" but because the characters felt a lot of pain, just like in real life. This, to me, is the mark of a good movie: it makes you see and feel things that you see and feel in real life, regardless of your gender, sexuality, race, economic status, political beliefs or other traits. BBM made me think. I hope others will leave their preconceived notions at the cinema door so they can view the movie, experience emotions and think as well.",Brokeback Mountain

As Heath has stated in an interview, ""It's the story of a homophobic man who falls in love with another man.""Taken from a heartbreaking short story (which I love) of the same name, the film turns out better than I could ever have anticipated. All the parties involved are working at and beyond their best. Ang Lee directs with an incredibly insightful and steady hand, the script is a minimalist gem where every utterance carries meaning well beyond the words, the cinematography is splendidly evocative of the wide open and lonely spaces, and finally the actors -- ah, the actors -- all just superb: Heath Ledger is simply stunning in bringing Ennis Del Mar to life, Jake Gyllenhahl is his perfect partner, and both Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway do beautiful supporting work.By all means, see this film.

I had to splash water on my face to stop me from falling asleep. How slow was this movie????? Yes Yes the scenery was as good as any mountain range calendar I've seen. But the way the characters mumbled there way through this film drove me mad. I found the so called sex scene very silly, and the kissing scene looked to me like the actors were trying to cover up with hands each others faces...

I bow down to the ground. Do not let anybody take you apart from your love. Ennis Del Mar is too weak and scared to deal with that.A strange feeling rushed on me while watching the movie. It resembled something I knew. ""Giovanni's Room"" recast?Almost the same storyline. But ""Giovanni's Room"" has more relevant emotions and is richer with characters' expressions.

I am a country girl, and I love the setting, beautiful Wyoming, with all the horses and open fields. It is a realistic movie and I love the story line. Even with such a sad ending, the movie just really made me happy. Even the music was good, the actors, Heath Ledger and Jack Gyllenhaal amazing job, and good looking!

1559,DMChewie,"A beautiful, heart-wrenching film about love...",10,8 January 2006,"Speechless. Numbing. Amazing.These are just a few of the things I felt after seeing this movie. In fact, to call it a mere ""movie"" degrades this kind of art. Never before have I been moved so deeply by such simple imagery. A look, a kiss, a shirt, a mountain. The magic of this film lies in what is not said, but rather in what you see.Brokeback Mountain is a cinematic tour de force. Ang Lee really knows how to tell a love story. I've read reviews, seen comments, heard rumours, but nothing compares to a firsthand view of the the sheer strength of the story presented here.I think the most important thing to understand, however, is that this not a story about two ""gay"" cowboys. It's about two people who love each other. It's as simple as that. They expose themselves, albeit with some difficulty, to each other and to those around them, and in doing so find what we've all been searching for: Love.Shot against the luscious and majestic backdrop of the Alberta foothills and Rockies, this film could not have had a better visual setting. The cinematography is superbly done, and evokes feelings that match the relationship between Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar. It is because of the landscapes that Brokeback Mountain carries such a tremendous emotional punch.Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger deliver stunning performances as Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar. These two really have perfected the art of conveying feelings with simple flicks of their eyes. I can't remember a time when I ever felt such love and power behind a facial expression. Words cannot describe the feelings between these two young men, and this is something upon which Ang Lee has capitalized. Less is always more.The musical score is the final touch. The three ""Brokeback Mountain 1/2/3"" interludes mark key points in these men's lives. Each one builds in intensity, until the final one really drives home the message of this film: Love transcends all boundaries and obstacles.I highly recommend seeing this cinematic masterpiece, it will move you in ways you never thought possible. It will show you the true power of Love.",Brokeback Mountain
1560,what_is_the_Matrix23,Love this film,10,7 January 2006,"I love this movie in every which way possible. Finally a movie that showcases the fact the love has no color, race or gender. Both Heath and Jake were beyond good, but i have to admit that Heath's performance was so heartwarming and moving, and hopefully he gets recognized for it. I went to a great deal of trouble to see this film, since it was only playing in one theater, but it was so worth it. I really have to say that this film had quite the impact on me and i will never be same after that. Films such as ""Brokeback Mountain"" give me faith in Hollywood, that there are still great movies made about the most simple and yet difficult feeling in the world, love. And please don't let the fact that this movie is about two men in love steer you away from it, this is a truly a wonderful film.",Brokeback Mountain
1561,tehzer0,"Great Story, Great Acting, everything else... not so good.",3,13 January 2006,"Okay, I'm not going to dispute at all that this movie makes quite a statement. I think that's great, but a movie isn't just the statement it makes. The acting in the film was absolutely fantastic; I can give no criticism there. The story was absolutely compelling. Those things said, there seemed to me to be a HUGE amount of dead space in the movie that could have been completely removed and it would have made absolutely no difference. Scenery shots, etc. I know some people will cry blasphemy at me for making a comparison like this, but I will anyway. If you have ever seen Team America World Police, you likely noticed the large periods of time in the movie where it wasn't funny, and then spikes of pure hilarity. Brokeback is very similar; there is a large amount of boring dead space and then some of the most absolutely fantastic scenes I have seen in a long time. The gripping story and the fantastic acting don't make up for the time I spent dozing off out of boredom, it could have been a lot shorter and, as a result, much better.",Brokeback Mountain
1562,jimerogers,Heath Ledger impressive,10,7 January 2008,"His performance in this film is one of my favorite characters in any movie I have ever seen. His lifelong conflict with having fallen in love with a man, and being ashamed of himself for it. His decision to never allow himself to find happiness in any relationship with either a woman or a man. His characters emotional conflicts and the way he confronted them, hit me hard in the gut.I found it interesting that Jack would go to male prostitutes from time to time, but Enis would not. Enis's only male relationship was with Jack and he kept it a secret from the world. It took a lot of guts for him to visit Jack's parents as they were obviously aware of who he was. Jack's homosexuality was far more open than Enis's and they had to know his secret. Jack's Mom showed him compassion, but his Dad chose not to even look at him. Enis chose to come face to face with his inner demons. Some of my favorite scenes.When he kicked the crap out of the Gypsy Jokers at the 4th of July fair. A couple of obnoxious drunks swearing with children all around and he showed such assertiveness to clearly express himself to them, to not use language around the kids. When they mouthed off he went directly to aggressive and did what a real Cowboy would do. He stood up for himself and his family. He was a Man's Man.The scene where he ran into the cute girl that fell in love with him was very powerful. I guess he decided not to hurt her or any woman again the way he did his wife.Another of my favorite scenes was when he and Jack were having their confrontation by the river and he told Jack ""Your why I am this way"". A very powerful scene.The final scene with him sticking the address numbers on his mailbox. Junior stops by to invite him to her wedding. The culmination of all he ever earned in his life and there he was in the middle of nowhere, living in a trailer, a cold and lonely place he put himself, due to his inner conflicts. As though he chose to punish himself for ever more. But he had his daughter's love. He had at least that to show for his life, and it made me feel good for him. And Jack's shirt hanging in the closet for his memories.I have seen a lot of movies in my life, but I have never seen one like this. I mentioned to my adult children that I liked this move. My daughter laughed and my son just played it off. My girlfriend ignores it. We watch 4 or 5 movies a week together. Never this one.I find it interesting how people will avoid uncomfortable subject matter and miss out on such a great movie. I'm glad I bit the bullet and watched this movie on HBO. I have seen it at least a dozen times and I still continue to watch every time it airs.",Brokeback Mountain
1563,jesvideo-1,BrokeBack Mountain,9,25 February 2006,This film by Ang Lee is an amazing accomplishment because even straight people will be drawn into Heath Ledgers performance of Ennis. On this actors face you can see the pain and anguish. It's impossible not to be moved by his performance. This story of forbidden love will resonate to the Oscars for sure! What else can I say about such a moving love story between two men trapped by society into living a lie. The rest of this revue is just to fill in the words as we should not be forced into at least writing 10 lines.Some people can write less and get their point across just as well as having to write 10 lines.

I feel ownership over the mistakes that the characters made. Their good memories and genuine love soften the edge on a bad day for me. I read the short story before I went and saw the movie, and thought that it was incredibly well-written, but I was interested (and somewhat skeptical) to see how a filmmaker was planning on drawing out the action any better than Annie Proulx already had. Obviously from this review, my skepticism was misplaced, and what I found in Ang Lee's vision could be described as nothing less than mournfully captivating. Finally, someone in Hollywood got the notion of a love story right. Refreshing as the Wyoming setting, Ang Lee truly did the story justice, while adding his own insights along the way. This film makes you want to fix what went wrong, mend twenty years of hurt and see the world the film provides continue. 'Brokeback Mountain' makes you a part of the story, even if the characters on the screen can't see you, you certainly feel them.I was pleasantly surprised by Williams' and Hathaway's performances, guiltily, I hadn't expected much from them, but they prove that they are absolutely essential to this film. Quaid creates the quintessential face of bigotry which shocked my previous view of the roles he chose. Gyllenhaal wears every emotion on his sleeve, and despite the film spanning over twenty years, the initial joy and pleasure the audience witnesses in his eyes when he first meets Ennis is never subdued. But Ledger truly makes this movie, I don't believe anyone else could have developed the story in the way he did. Ledger's performance is absolutely heartbreaking. I feel drawn to go see this movie again, but afraid to at the same time. God, the end still makes me ache. Truly haunting...",Brokeback Mountain

Above all this is what viewers are left with, a depth-less feeling of loneliness, of melancholy, of indescribable loss, of deep and unhealable sadness. I saw BBM last Sunday and had to go back Monday to see it again. I could not shake the feelings the movie left me with. I felt, still feel, as if a hollow place in my chest has been opened up: a well of sadness, a universal repository of some of the core feelings of what it means to be a human being. But I recognized it. I've felt it many times before. It's the ""McMurtry Effect"" and it is all over his novels. Want some more of it? Read anything McMurtry wrote: Lonesome Dove, The Streets of Laredo, most importantly The Last Picture Show. Rent this movie or read the book. There again you will find it. Now whether it affects you like Brokeback Mountain is a personal thing. But McMurtry's genius is just this thing. Of course I know that Annie Proulx wrote the short story. But compare the short story to the screen play written by McMurtry and his co-writer and you will see what i mean.

After repeatedly thinking it through, I realized what I believe is the film's true message: through even the most painful of love, the passion that two people can conceivably hold for one another tears everything else apart, negatively or positively. Heath Ledger's performance as Ennis del Mar was absolutely amazing and should be grounds for every award the film industry has to offer. Michelle Williams' performance as a young mother in a loveless marriage was absolutely heart-shattering. Her eyes welt up to tell a story no other actress could. The film leaves a stamp on the viewers heart that is simply devastating. The film isn't without its faults, albeit minor. The aesthetic aging that Lureen and Jack undergo is a bit unbelievable. I'm still not sure whether it's due to my original image of Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhaal, or if it was simply bad makeup/hair pieces. The faults are minor and in the end the film opens a slew of social questions one can't help but ponder. Ang Lee's 'Brokeback' is no doubt one of the best pictures of 2005.",Brokeback Mountain

I didn't cry although I was happy that the emotional scenes were not blown up, you know like to much drama. That makes it so realistic. Normally when you watch those types of movies, you say to yourself ah..it's just a movie. With this masterpiece you don't get that feeling at all. The balance between fiction and real life are perfectly dosed. It's like your part of the movie..Sensational feeling. You feel sad and happy at the same time...you feel sorry for them not able to express their love. I thought America was the land of freedom!! Not as long Bush is around.

1570,jaymjay,Interesting but disappointing,5,7 March 2006,"In the end Brokeback is a film with a hole where it's heart should be. It purports to be a gay love story but it is in truth not about love but denial. There is no reason for the two characters to start their gay relationship, but once started there is no truth in the way that it is played out. That Jack Twist turns into a thrill seeker and that Ennis becomes more taciturn, if that is possible, gives an even more muddied view of the pair. The treatment by the men of their respective wives is stereotypical and the wives only seem to be there to give a reason for the men to be apart. It's interesting that IMDb's movie of the day ""The Hired Hand"" takes as its starting premise the association of two cowboys drifting through the west taking jobs as they come without any suggestion of homosexuality. Far from being robbed of the Best Picture Oscar it should never have been there in the first place. Nothing about the story convinces, especially not that moustache.",Brokeback Mountain

And let me tell you-I'm in complete awe of Ledgers and Gyllenhaal's performance. What a beautiful pair of actors-the courage and downright frankness of their ability to show such love for one-another. And I hate that 'oh but they must be gay to play those roles' as I've been asked. you only need to have lived and loved to know how to pull this off-and obviously they have. I've been slowly pulled into this film, completely overwhelmed by the story. Who hasn't been there with that embrace they have after being apart so many years...the giddiness, the tired yearning and eventually the unbelievable pain and lust one feels for one-another after so long apart. I'am Jakes' Jack Twist-I too feel the need, the complete and utter love that I have for my Ennis has me in a hold that I can sometimes barely stand. I feel as frustrated as Jack--but sooo in love that I will do anything to keep my Ennis, no question about it. I have been in 'holes' that my Ennis has dug for us in the early years of our now blissful 18 years together-my partner and I. And we have survived, and loved one another so much more for it. BBM has got me good-and I feel the Jack in me, ooh what a beautiful man and the pain, the pain for the love I have is shown in that incredible embrace that Jack and Ennis share on the mountain-on that last trip where Ennis comes up behind Jack while he's standing looking so serene, and whispers something to the effect of 'falling asleep on me twist?...'I still can't get this image out of my head, and I would love to know exactly what was it that Ennis says to Jack before they part once again?..and the soundtrack--so surreal, so haunting, the song 'the wings'is without mention(as many of you know) just....I don't have words to describe what that song does to me... and the opening theme, and definitely Rufus' Maker Makes.. thank you Ang Lee, and yes we do somehow have it good living here in S. Cal. as compared to rural towns out west...we take for granted what we have, and it takes something like BBM to bring us back down to earth.

Last weekend changed it all as me and my girlfriend missed ""Walk the line"" and caught Brokeback Mountain instead. I just loved it, every scene, every line and every expression in this film is just so moving and drives it to new heights. From the beautiful scenic scenes down the the everyday life scenes just makes it so likable and moving. From my point of view Brokeback Mountain is not only an Oscar front runner, but a movie that can change lives and change narrow minded people.Nothing bad can be said about anything in this feature, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall is amazing and bring out the best in each other. The supporting cast is exactly that, supporting the main characters and the director Ang Lee has really outdone himself and made what i as of February 2006 declare the film of the decade.

1575,Strangeshoeguy,"Beautiful, groundbreaking, historical",10,14 December 2005,"The midnight screening at the arc light cinema in Hollywood was a tremendous milestone for me. This film exhibits what people continually ask for from the movies today: originality. Ang Lee took a difficult story and translated it into a fantastic film. The luminous landscapes coupled with the well-paced story give the movie a feeling of dimension and grandeur, while not overpowering the tremendous work of the actors.Heath Ledger, whom I previously thought of as a piece of eye-candy rarely well-utilized, really takes the seeds of talent he exhibited in Monster's Ball and allows them to come to fruition in Ennis Del Mar. His inner turmoil and inherently awkward nature are painful enough to watch; add in the explosively desirous and possibly dangerous character of jack Twist played by Jake Gyllenhaal and the near-tangible temperament of the 1960's and it's enough to make your heart break.Every member of the supporting cast comes correct and makes this world a reality. Anne Hathaway is gorgeous (even beneath a country-fright-wig in a few scenes) and makes the most of each and every scene she has, taking Jake's charisma and meeting it wink for wink. Rounding out the film with the daring and emotive Michelle Williams we have a quartet of the most amazing young actors and actresses in Hollywood right now, and if they continues to make choices like this, I will follow them no matter where they go. I was afraid that this movie might be yet another attempt by Hollywood to do something daring which resulted in clichés and let-downs. The surprising truth is that regardless of one's sexuality, this film is a beautiful example of that elusive thing: undying love. I have a feeling this movie will be preaching to the choir, but I sincerely hope that others will give it a chance.",Brokeback Mountain
1576,x_in_a_box,No Pushing,6,8 January 2006,"I just saw this movie. A theater full of women, and an odd few men,left crying. I wasn't crying.Was this really the so called 'love story of the year' as it has been so generously coined already? I don't think so. It was pretty good, but it didn't really break a boundary for me, or for the audience it is being shown too. I live in Conservative Alberta, and I was impressed with the baby step the film took, but I was hoping for it to push further. Of course, this is a lot of pressure for a film, considering that it is already under so much pressure being the 'gay cowboy movie'. The problem I have with it is-it WAS the 'gay cowboy movie'. I didn't fully receive a performance inflicting the undeniable 'forces of nature' consistently shown throughout the movie. I felt that it was a little bit more focused on dealing with a gay relationship, than actually being in the relationship. There was a lot of everyone else and not enough time with Ennis and Jack. The moments were so brief, maybe to emphasize the shortness of time they were together, but what love? There were short glances of what could have been really very emotional, moreover, touching scenes- but there was just a lot of arguing about them moving up and away to the little ranch and having their little life. The movie was upsetting, because they couldn't be together, and how hard it was living in these times being gay- but where is the unconditional love? Where were the scenes to convince an audience of a love coming from a soul, and being unconditional, having nothing to do with gender? This was very much about gender, and not so much love. I think the movie needs a different tag-line.Apart from the false advertising, I believed Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhal's performances were really impressive, especially Ledger. The aging was subtle and very effective in the sense of time.We've still have a long way to go.",Brokeback Mountain
1577,j112177c,movie needs an active watcher,10,30 January 2006,"The acting brilliance was in the silence. Heath Ledger was amazing. I don't care what the topic was, whether or not is was a love story, acting without words the way he did was second to none. One of the greatest on screen performances that I have ever seen. Now as far as the narrow minded people who think that two men falling in love and having sex is too taboo for a motion picture, you are all too out of focus to be judging an artistic film like this anyways. Stick to commenting on action flicks, and I stress flicks because they are not films in the historical sense of the word, like the matrix. A film doesn't have to be full of attention grabbing dialogue and witty comebacks to be a great film. I am sorry that DelMar didn't say ""eat this"" before he punched Jack out. This was one of the most honest, and humble films that caught emotion better than any I have ever seen. This film doesn't take a stand or try to give you some fake over the top theme. The fact that the emotions are implied and not spelled out for the watcher force you to think and have some empathy for the characters. It is painfully obvious that some of us do not have that ability.",Brokeback Mountain
1578,thepdt,Beautiful,10,7 January 2006,"This film stayed with me and invaded my waking thoughts. The Oscar-worthy performances (Heath Ledger deserves the hype) cement the story as an instant classic. The fact that the protagonists are two men is irrelevant, their situation is just a vehicle for a beautiful story of forbidden love and its consequences. There is nothing remotely ""gratuitous"" about any of the sex scenes - they exist merely to show the relationship between them and are integral to the point. This film is a grown-up, frank portrayal of a love story, with an ending that will stay with you as it did me. The characters are destined to be immortalised in the hearts and minds of anyone who watches this, each is so expertly portrayed and deep. Anne Hathaway, in particular, in one of the closing scenes which is filmed entirely in close-up, is a revelation, shedding her Disney image.Overall, this is a powerful and haunting story, and I urge you to see it.",Brokeback Mountain

I wanted to see it because I heard the action was intense. They meant the action was in tents. I knew their preferences were suspect when they hired on to watch sheep. The movie was not realistic. True cowboys jump in the river. They don't take sponge baths. This movie should have been called ""Beans and Franks"". I do give the characters credit though. It must have been tough getting in the saddle the next morning. Heath Ledger's mumbling dialog was interesting. Did he take the marbles out of his mouth for the kissing scenes? Seriously, just because a movie addresses controversial subject matter doesn't automatically make it good. It was boring and bad. To make sure any personal homophobic bias hasn't crept in. I imagined one of the cowpokes being a pretty female. The movie still failed my test.",Brokeback Mountain
1580,brackett9,Amazing!,10,23 January 2006,"This movie was easily the best film of 2005. Nothing else even came close to achieving what ""Brokeback Mountain"" has. More than simply showing the relationship between these two men, the audience is drawn in and feels the way Jack and Ennis do. Heath Ledger is astonishing in the role of Ennis Del Mar. After such ""teen"" films like ""10 Things I Hate About You"" and A Knight's Tale,"" it was great to see him completely get into this role. I never once thought ""oh, it's just Heath Ledger on screen."" He became Ennis, plain and simple. Also, Jake Gyllenhaal, who has always been a solid actor, truly becomes Jack Twist. The supporting cast is equally great, as is the script, cinematography and director. Congratulations to Heath, Jake, Michelle, Anne, and especially Ang Lee for making the best, most emotionally resonant film of the year!",Brokeback Mountain

Would suggest to anyone to go see it and form your own opinion Its a love story, but different from any other love story It makes you really care what happens to the two characters It really makes you think. The film deserves to win an Oscar and also Heath Ledger and Jake Gylenhaal deserve one too taking on such challenging roles, which became, as you watched them, highly believable and real.

The plot is there and not over bearing but just the right balance. If the academy snubs this movie then what is the purpose of the academy awards anyways. The 2Hrs plus went by without once checking my watch. Michelle Williams hasn't changed much from her days on the Creek still an excellent actress . Anne Hathaway has grown up. This movie definitely is much more than a gay love story. Its about life and love no matter where you find it. It truly is a force of nature. I think I'll change my original vote from a 9 to a 10. Go see this movie. Christmas is here and this was a great present to watch. The soundtrack is very good as well with old faithful Willie Nelson leading the way. Excellent!",Brokeback Mountain

The scenery was breathtaking and almost surreal. The cast completed each other almost perfectly. Heath Ledger's performance will be discussed for years to come, as well as Jake Gyllenhaal's. You cannot leave from this work of art without being affected by it. This was a beautiful and extremely touching portrait of a love story between two people that I can only classify as universal. Go see it and form your own opinion; I think you will be profoundly surprised. I honestly feel this movie will change cinema as we know it.",Brokeback Mountain

Each time I see it I see something new and moving; each time I cried. In 45 years I have not cried at a movie, not till now. Like all true art this film has stirred me in so many ways.I have read many of the reviews and have been amazed by the many outpourings and astute observations by so many different people. I have also been saddened and appalled by a number of them. Although not surprised by some of the Christian right messages I have been upset by the hate and relentless stupidity of them. Like Ennis I was raised a bible thumping 'methodist'. It was not until after high school and thousands of days and nights of fear and heartbreak that I was able to free myself of all mythological theist enslavement and begin to live. Maybe that's why I cried: I wanted so much to free these beautiful men.",Brokeback Mountain
1585,salvomc,Very beautiful and powerful,10,10 March 2006,"You excuse my English: The film never results rhetorical, the screenplay of Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana is faithful to the original story of Annie Proulx. Splendid the cinematography of Rodrigo Prieto, the natural sceneries are very beautiful and fully protagonists. Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal and Michelle Williams extraordinary. The score of Santaolalla is splendid. The direction of Ang Lee impeccable. All of this contributes to perfectly make the believable history. For the first time the theme is treated without any vulgarity. A sin that the homophobia will bring many not to see it. The film is powerful. The history remains you inside, it saddens, but it makes to reflect on the love and the life. The Brokeback Mountains are not anything else other than a place to whose search goes all, perhaps a mental state, where is you free from every inhibition, where to find the love, that a life fills, if the whole life we are fortunate. But it doesn't need to let him escape it, because if don't have love you don't have anything.",Brokeback Mountain
1586,redincognito,** SPOILER** A tragic figure and a conformist,7,15 March 2006,"Shortly after watching Brokeback I happened to rent the Celluloid Closet, the documentary about Hollywood's treatment of the subject of homosexuality. For years homosexuals were misrepresented in film as sissies, outcasts, mentality ill and self-loathing people who are ashamed of their ""problem."" They generally met a tragic end-death by the town or community or suicide. (Suddenly, Last Summer and the Children's Hour) So why is Brokeback such a bold and different film? How is Hollywood treating the love between two men any differently in the new millennium? When Alma confronts Ennis about his fishing trips she never openly says she knows he was gay or was sleeping around with Jack. The subject is skirted as it was in old films. Jack ends up as the tragic figure who dies at the hands of a homophobic mob. He, unlike Jack, was willing to risk it all in order to be with Ennis. Jack was also the one searching for the love of another man when Ennis wouldn't run off with him. Is death punishment for Jack's homosexuality? Ennis, on the other hand conformed to the standards of society and lived to see his girls grow and marry. Ennis dated another woman and never slept with another man other than Jack. The movie ends with him as a father figure and not as a man who lost the love of his life to the homophobia he feared since childhood. How has Brokeback treated homosexuality any differently than the old Hollywood films?",Brokeback Mountain
1587,Sampura,"Score, and Filming?! .. amazing!",10,19 January 2006,"Besides all the political comments and the negative remarks to the hype of the story, The movie was shot unbelievably well. The images of Brokeback mountain we're just breathtaking, and the musical score... no wonder it won a Grammy.Very solid movie. I think the interesting point of the movie is how little it touches on the homosexual acts and content, and that makes the impact much more intense.My point, the story itself disagree, or agree... I find to be very good. The musical score, and the filming, there is no denying. It deserves a Grammy.",Brokeback Mountain
1588,faravaga,"In Heaven, you can be yourself",10,14 June 2006,"I just saw Brokeback Mountain last weekend, for the first time, on DVD; it's been several days, and now I'm here - and glad to see I'm not alone.A Canadian friend exhorted me to see this in February; she also lent me the Annie Proulx story on which it's based. I was prepared for this movie to be very, very, VERY sad.But 'sad' doesn't do it. This movie is truly devastating.I've been crying for days; a blossom of evening sky, a guitar lick from the score, a flash of a pregnant image from the movie, and my whole frame convulses. - I don't do much Hollywood, or movies in general; never reviewed a movie before, like many on this site; but this is a *phenomenon*.I don't think there are words to describe the effect this movie can have; mention of sleepless nights, inexplicable longings, addictive reactions, the spontaneous memory of an image causing a sudden tsunami of emotion: the experience is really beyond telling, reflected in the multitude of reviews. It's all happening to me: I'm glad to know I'm not alone.There may be critical 'holes' in it, here or there; but they disappear in the overwhelming effect of the whole. Performances invisible; visually mesmerising; gracefully paced, and unerringly spare. Ennis'/Ledger's story is mythical in its depth and classical in its tragedy: to know, only when it's gone, how fulfilled your life was with something, and how empty it will be after. Highest praise all round; the Academy was wrong. This one meteor-ed right into my top 10 films list; and it's by far the most affecting film I've ever seen. By all means see it, if you have the openness to cope with the subject matter; but be prepared to be undone. You will not leave Brokeback Mountain the same person you were coming to it.",Brokeback Mountain
1589,caroline-baxter,Brilliant,10,22 January 2006,"This incredibly moving film grabs you from the opening scene with a breathtaking panoramic view of the countryside. From that first moment you are drawn into the lonely and hard world of the two lead characters.The romance is handled deftly and you are left in no doubt right from the start of the all consuming love and friendship that the two men have for each other. To Ennis this is all new and unexpected, he falls in love with Jack the person and not Jack because he is a man. Jack is clearly more aware of his sexuality so he comes to the relationship from a slightly different direction.The love between the two men and the conflict they face mostly from within themselves is shattering. All they want is to be together but they know that it is impossible despite Jack's best efforts.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal give performances that will go down in movie history as two of the best ever in my humble opinion, The supporting cast is both brilliantly cast and performed. The look on Michelle Williams face as reality dawns is one that will haunt me for a very long time. Linda Cardinelli's performance,surprisingly not much mentioned, was deeply moving and as for Jack's father in law, the part was a total gem and the performance was one to match! This movie will stay with me for ever and the 1 minutes silence in the movie theatre that reigned as the credits rolled leaves me to believe that I will be not alone.I cannot recommend this movie more highly.This is not a ""Gay movie"" this is just a simple, painful and very beautiful love story.",Brokeback Mountain
1590,kalaevans_30126,Best love story ever!!!,10,23 July 2006,"The only thing that this movie can ultimately be called is ""The greatest love story of all time"". Two men who are in love, but they won't say the word is fantastic. Ennis the one who keeps his emotions bottles up falls in love with the talker Jack on Brokeback Mountain. Years later the men reunite and their passion is just as strong as it was years ago on the mountain. They meet up about 3-4 times a year in the mountains. Their love tortures both of them. How come they just can't end the relationship? Because they both have found true love in each other. Jack, frustrated with Ennis, sees other men, but ultimately he knows he's in love with Ennis and still miserable without him. Which makes him even more frustrated knowing that he can't ""quit"" Ennis. Ennis just can't speak what he's feeling to anyone. Though he is more open to Jack than anyone else, the fact that Jack is a man forbids Ennis to tell him how he really feels. Which tears Jack apart inside. Ennis didn't realize how he felt about Jack until his death. When he finds the shirts in the closet, that is when he realized just how much Jack loved him, and how much he loved Jack, but it was too late. What really gets to me about the movie is that Ennis could've had a life with Jack and he chose not to. And after Jack's death, he has to live with regret and guilt. The movie has made me redefine the word love and re-evaluate my life.",Brokeback Mountain
1591,black_flowered_seas,Movie making at its most brilliant,10,15 January 2006,"This movie is so beautifully acted it is heartbreaking. What a masterpiece. On my All Time Top Five. I love the message conveyed by Jake's and Heath's acting - they are truly deserving of the acting accolades they have been receiving of late. A definite Oscar winner and I will most likely go and see it again. We could all stand to learn a lot about tolerance from this film and the heartbreaking loneliness of not being able to live life the way one would like. The screenplay was mesmerizing, the filmography just unbelievable. The shot of the cowboy riding his horse up the steep mountain incline with the blue sky behind him would be hanging on my wall if it were a picture. The two supporting actresses were great too, and it goes without saying that Ang Lee has probably made just about the most perfect film of its genre. How brilliant can you get?",Brokeback Mountain

I've heard a lot of great reviews about this movie like 'ground breaking' and 'best movie of the year'. Unfortunately, I found the movie a little boring and tedious. What was all the fuss about? Although the story was good and the mountain scenes were spectacular, it still seemed too long and I have to endure 2 and a half hours of it. I'm not sure if it was just me, and I'm sorry to those who liked this film so much. The day I watched Brokeback Mountain, I was really tired and stressed out, so I guess that was the reason behind my huge disappointment. I'll try to watch the movie again, maybe the second time I see it, it would amuse me just like the others. I'd still give it an 8.",Brokeback Mountain
1593,henry-156,The Perfect Movie,10,9 January 2006,"If you are looking to be moved by a story, then this is the movie to see. I saw this movie just a few days ago, and have found myself thinking about it's story since then. It's a truly brutal, touching, real and uncompromising story. Brutal because it's real and holds no punches, touching because I found myself uncontrollably sobbing many times throughout, and for days after, and real and uncompromising because whilst it leaves so much unsaid - it's real beauty - it says so much by not saying it.From the beautiful, breathtaking vistas, captured by perfect cinematography, to the wonderful actors: Heath and Jake. I'm yet to see a better performance from any actor in this generation, these two define perfection. What a brave thing for them to do, and they could not have done it better. Michelle and Anne are pretty great too, Anne particularly doing something that perhaps is outside of her ""regular"" repertoire; Michelle, as always putting in a great performance.What strikes me with this movie is the press, and many peoples (who haven't seen it) focus on the gay-cowboy aspect. This is an important facet - a nod to the gay community that is long overdue - but it is so much more. The story is so believable that we all know it's real, that challenge of this movie, is that it is so disturbing, heart-rendering and painful for those of us who believe in true love despite the odds. Having read the short story after seeing the movie, the movie keeps close to the storyline, with only a few deviations that the genre allows. Ang Lee, and the screenwriters have something to be proud of, and hopefully this represents the start of a bravery in Hollywood to portray gay men and women in any story. Love doesn't have to be about a man and a woman, and I think all but a few agree. This is the pinnacle of film-making, my only worry is that we will never again see a movie this moving, thought-provoking, beautiful and defining of a generation.",Brokeback Mountain

Think Bridges of Madison country with 2 men and Ur halfway there.

Although it does add in extra bits (i suppose it would have to what with the book being so short) they didn't really seem out of place. The acting of the two main actors was excellent, and their love story seemed so real and passionate that i could not help to sympathise and wish that life could turn out differently for them. The scenery is beautiful, and its loneliness and vastness adds to the atmosphere of the film.I really recommend it, but don't go if you are wanting something light hearted lol!

I can say, that overall, there were about 20 minutes of this film that were worth watching. There was no flow to this film, and it was outright boring. I have never fallen asleep while in the theater, but I almost did this time. This movie just seemed like an American shot at foreign ""gay"" films. There are, by far, much better ""gay"" films out there than this one. The one on the top of my list (from the ones that I have seen) would be ""The Sum of Us"". For those of you who do not know, this was an Australian film, staring Russel Crowe, which told the story of the relationship between a father and his gay son. Honestly, a very good and touching film, whether you are a Russel Crowe person or not (it was before his Hollywood days). Overall, this movie was garbage, but maybe this garbage will help every closed minded American to open up a little bit. We usually love bad movies in this country either way.(this holds no reference to my review, but I am gay, and I think that the only reason this movie was given good reviews was so that GLAAD wouldn't get ticked off that the first American gay film to contain Hollywood actors, and hit somewhat big, would flop)",Brokeback Mountain

The photography is good to look at but the dialogue is virtually unintelligible. The acting is good but in the end I was so bored I couldn't have cared what happened to the main characters - I just wanted something to happen so the movie would stop and I could go home. Thank god it didn't win an Oscar. I went to see it because of the hype (silly me)and because we are horse people so we thought cowboys may be fun but, hey, they couldn't even ride decently!

I am here to tell you, uncatagorically, ""YES!!!"". After seeing the film one time in Palm Springs, I remember walking to my car haunted by Ennis and Jack's tragic love story. Tears clouding my eyes for hours after. No other movie has done that so deeply to me. You truly are ""hit in the gut"". The theater erupted in applause for the movie after the ending. It was as if the audience were trying to wrap its arms around the movie and offer a collective shoulder on which to cry. The completely devastating last 15 minutes or so of the film are some of the most heart-wrenching fictional moments ever captured on film in my opinion. If you are not moved to tears, or don't have a lump in your throat, you'd better get to the hospital to check if you have a pulse! After taking two of my friends to see Brokeback, one of them sort of gasped ""What?!"" at the end...""No that can't be the ending...they can't leave us like that"". For that reason she said she didn't like the movie. I received an email from this friend a few days ago and she said she just couldn't stop thinking of the haunting images, and she definitely believes, now, that the film had a much deeper effect on her than she originally imagined. Heath Ledger, you deserve the Best Actor Oscar this year my friend--if only for the bravery and risk you took to put your skill to work on this amazing character! Forget comparisons to Marlon and to James Dean...you surpass them hundreds of times over. And Jake Gyllenhaal amazes me. I really didn't catch all the brilliance he lends to his portrayal until I saw the movie for the third time. He's incredible in his natural, raw, and reserved acting. The other actors are equally brilliant. It's as if everyone involved in the movie knew and understood the universal pain their story addressed. And in telling the story, they hold a mirror up to society and ask us all to look in and understand ourselves the fact that WE are Ennis and Jack, and that it's not their story we have watched...it's our own.

1600,insane26,Amazing Performances...see it just for those,9,4 January 2006,"**very minor spoilers*** This movie was great, although not without flaws. It has sometimes weird cuts, a sense of unfinished business, and no clear conclusions.BUT, it has some amazing performances and portrays the characters as multi-faceted, believable, and regardless of your orientation, it makes you feel compassion for these tragic beings.I'm gonna give you my opinion like this: I'm a 24 yr old gay dude, but this story is really made for a straight audience. I mean, there's no real sex, or saucy scenes. Each moment of gay ""lust"" or ""passion"" has a deeper entendre: when they first hook up, the desperation of both its characters, the second time they meet, the ferociousness of the build up and longing (especially Ennis) and that look on Michelle Williams's eyes is ....perfect. I would say her and Heath really give the film it's weight because they both portray the characters so well, it pulls you on both sides.But regardless of my thoughts, check it out. It'll make you think a bit. any movie that does that in today's world...is worth watching.I think the subtle nature of this movie is similar to A History of Violence, another great movie which is prob this movie's biggest competition.Check it out.",Brokeback Mountain

(It reminded me of the ""Ice Storm"" in that respect.) Like all other posters have said, Heath Ledger does a REMAKABLE job and is a show in for an Oscar nomination. Especially as the ""older"" Ennis, he just inhabits the character in every bone and sinew of his being.What I especially loved about the film (NOT A SPOILER)is by the end of the movie, the viewer GETS IT that these two guys loved each other. It's portrayed so purely and cinematically and without dialogue (which is one of Ang Lee's greatest strengths).

Love & Great Acting,10,25 December 2005,"To be able to watch a movie and know that someone finally was able to capture real love on screen- not lust or teen crush films- but what real love is like..and for a straight person to watch it and believe that those two were in love..wow! It was amazing. This is the first time that I have ever commented on a movie on IMDb! That is how much this movie is just staying with me. If for nothing else, go to see the acting. The leading men and ladies were amazing in their roles. Heath Ledger should be nominated for an Oscar- Jake too! Brokeback Mountain is unforgettable..my friends and I are forever touched by this film. I love FOCUS FEATURES!",Brokeback Mountain
1605,coffeegirljlh,Long and Boring!!!,4,24 January 2006,"I seem to be one of the few who didn't like this movie. The make-up was great on the cast in aging all of them. Jake Gyllenhaal did a great job as well as Heath Ledger, which made me wonder how come only Heath Ledger got nominated for a Globe. Michelle Williams portrayed the character Alma amazingly because that's what I would imagine any wife would do in that situation, except if I saw my man kissing another guy I wouldn't be staying with him anymore. She was a brave and strong character for the 1970's.I watched this movie as I have wanted to see it since it came out and was disappointed by how long and boring it was. There was too much focused on Jack and Ennis and not enough to show their lives in their homes with their families.",Brokeback Mountain
1606,fallin2thegap22,Wow...,9,5 March 2006,"OK, I want to say that this move was one of the most powerfully intense movies I have seen in my entire life! Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal gave performances that exceeded my expectations. For them to play these roles (and I can only imagine how difficult that was), and let themselves be completely submersed in the characters deserves the highest recognition possible. This movie covered that entire scale of emotions for me. I laughed, I cried, I got angry, depressed, sad, you name it, I felt it! I am so glad that a director had the guts to finally touch on such a taboo subject in life. If you go to see this movie, allow yourself to feel every aspect of this movie, and you won't walk away disappointed! To Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, thank you, for allowing yourselves to become these two men, and show the world the power of love.",Brokeback Mountain

1608,slyslick18,yawn,5,6 February 2006,"I found this movie very boring. It just didn't hold my interest. This story is one that i have seen millions of times and so has everyone else, the only difference is that there are two dudes involved. Now I am not anti-gay at all, I do think there are interesting stories involving gay characters and I am not apposed to watching them (Capote was simply incredible) however when the interest of the story and the only reason it gets any play is because there are gay characters, I DON'T CARE!!! If it was the same story with the same amount of good acting with a woman and a man then it wouldn't be academy award nominated. The reason why it's getting so much recognition is that they cast two attractive men in it and said ""look at this it's controversial!"" Screw that.On a somewhat different note though, I would like to say that director Ang Lee should receive best director for taking a step outside his normal movie and taking a chance. I don't' like his movies normally, Crouching Tiger was a cheesy movie and The Hulk was the worst comic book movie made since Daredevil, but this movie didn't annoy the crap out of me. The movie is decent, don't get me wrong, I just think it's not as good as everyone says. If you wanna see a great movie with Jake Gyllenhal watch Jarhead or Donny Darko. If you want to watch a great movie with Heath Ledger then ummmm.... good luck, unless of course you like crap like Brothers Grimm.",Brokeback Mountain
1609,kaptain_kamikaze,One word : Boring,3,17 May 2006,"I never leave the cinema halfway through a film. Never. I was sorely tempted to here.To be honest - I don't know what all the fuss is about. The movie, is plain and simple - boring. I left the cinema wondering where 2 hours of my life went. Aside from the very choppy editing which gives the viewer no real idea as to the passing of time, and the monotonous soundtrack comprising of four notes and a chord, there really wasn't any story. There wasn't much conflict, and well, the characters went from not saying two words to each other to lovers in a matter of seconds, while each insisted they were straight. There would be some conflict there. What is also a shame is how this film, used the taboo it concerns to make itself successful, whereas really the love story should have been it. The same story could have been told about a straight couple (seeing as both characters were in other relationships - it would be a different taboo) - I really think the director missed a trick there.I was very disappointed with this film.There was some nice scenery, and some great acting, but in my opinion these were not good enough to carry the film. Shame really.",Brokeback Mountain
1610,moog67,"Love, against one's will",10,10 December 2005,"The tag-line in the poster for this movie say's it all. These are two people who neither expected, were aware of, or asked for this kind of love but it came upon them anyway. Against all reason, against what they could accept. In their minds, especially Ennis', THERE WAS NO SUCH THING. And yet there it was, whether they liked it or not. Love really is sometimes a force of nature. Some people artificially talk themselves into it, these two men were invaded by it almost against their will, which is the most romantic scenario of all when you think about it. We can't pick and choose our soul mates, they just happen to us, at least those of us who are lucky enough to stumble upon them.One more point: The last time I was this impressed-no-knocked out by a performance was Emily Watson in ""Breaking The Waves"" Heath Ledger became Ennis to the point where I won't be able to see him in any other role without thinking of Ennis. Ennis was a completely real person to me, and I guess that's the highest praise you can give an actor about their performance.",Brokeback Mountain
1611,john_mn66,Pass on Brokeback Mountain,3,26 December 2005,"I was disappointed with the movie. The story behind the movie is very powerful but I was not impressed with the character development, plot, acting, or emotion of the movie. The scenes with Jake and Heath are not natural and it shows. Jake gets the closest to demonstrating real emotion in the movie. It is too bad it misses the target. Those in the theater were more touched by the humor of the movie than the tragedy of the male love story. That tells me that the movie missed the mark.Maybe society is ready for a gay cowboy movie but this movie fails to deliver. Don't pay full price for this one or the only tears you shed will be for the money you wasted seeing this movie at full price.",Brokeback Mountain
1612,MovingTooFast,The Power / The Realisations,10,1 February 2006,"Ennis averts his eyes and hunches over to avoid saying what he feels, in addition to the visual communication there is a vast array of subplots and realisations. The most effecting to me is the fact that Ennis avoided 'shacking' up with Jack due to it being the perceived ""wrong thing to do"" however the moment where you realise that it is in fact Jack's parents ranch which Jack wanted to share with Ennis and Jack's parents did actually know he was gay and kept expecting someone to come back with him. That to me would be the most hard hitting realisation for Ennis that he missed this opportunity for happiness in what I am sure would have been a beautiful existence on the ranch supported by in the very least Jack's mother.It is not often that a film comes along where you think about it for days and the sadness not only makes you cry but you cannot help but feel there is a lesson in it for all of us. At every fork in the road look down both paths, there is always a chance you can be happier. You never know. But remember ""Love Is A Force Of Nature"" believe in it.Never have I been emotionally effected by a film in my 30 years. And I don't think I will be for many many years if ever. The day after seeing the movie and then buying the soundtrack and book I still feel there is a message I have not gotten from the film. From tears to happiness every hour is precious.Although I am in a happy relationship with a beautiful man this film makes me think of those missed opportunities I have had in my life. Opportunities that if presented again I will never just brush to the side.",Brokeback Mountain
1613,magicmote,A jewel of a film.,10,9 July 2006,"I love this movie. Really love it. Haunting score, stunning cinematography, gripping performances, timeless tale--everything. People quibble about non-essentials. I'm female, middle-aged, hetero, and I defy you to tell me that the average straight guy is any more expressive than Ennis or any less needy than Jack. Or the average gal, either, straight or gay. Deeper than their sex, their sexuality, their religious, educational, economic or historic backgrounds, Jack and Ennis are two human beings living in the world as they find it--beautiful and indifferent at best, and as they find themselves--beautiful and flawed at best. Desire is desire. The desire for warmth, for connection, for any echo at all in the vastness of time and space, is shared by every human being ever to have lived. For me, the issue is not how repressed or thwarted Ennis and Jack are, but how persistently they turn toward the light, despite all impediment. Brokeback Mountain lyrically retells a story thousands of years old: loss and grief are unavoidable; love is where you find it.",Brokeback Mountain
1614,ford_a,"A very good love story, but (possibly based on hype) not as great as everyone says.",8,4 February 2006,"I was expecting to leave this movie relatively unsatisfied. I had both read and seen all of the hype surrounding it, but based on the trailer, previews, and clips, I figured that the movie would be yet another generic love story featuring fantastic performances and a nice score. Thankfully, I was wrong, but it isn't great. At least not as great as I think everyone has been saying it is. First of all, let me say that I think that all of the actors and actresses were fantastic. Heath Ledger wowed me to no end with his excellent performance. What an actor. The same goes to Jake Gyllenhall. These two had fantastic chemistry, stellar performances, could pull off their accents, and looked very cute as a couple. I applaud the two of them for accepting the opportunity to take on these challenging roles that are quite a far step for two heart-throbs (because, let's face it, they are--I can't picture, oh say, Ashton Kutcher being in this movie). Michelle Williams is also fantastic. Her performance had me glued to the screen. Her character is so sympathetic and full of all kinds of feelings that she can't express in front of her husband. Once they are divorced and she finally confronts him is a scene that featured two spectacular performances on Williams' and Ledger's part. Wow. Bravo. Kudos, and whatnot. I loved that the film took its time with establishing the characters and the love story. After a long series of moments involving Gyllenhall and Ledger herding sheep and drinking whiskey and laughing and being scared by bears or whatever, the first sexual experience between the two is treated with maturity. It just happens and you understand that this has been building between the two of them and it works very well. Thank god there wasn't any awkward dialogue and cheesy ""May I kiss you?"" moments before it happened. No, it just happened and I loved that. However, my problems with the film are almost trivial in comparison with what I have with most films. I just felt that the film worked as a good love story. These two men love each other in a time when two men loving each other was considered very, very, very beating-said-man-to-death worthy. That's it. It didn't break any new ground (which is what friends and reviewers have been saying it has). I was actually surprised that it wasn't a barrage of sappy, melodramatic moments (although there were only a couple--sappy, not melodramatic). I felt for every character. I understood their flaws and the death of a particular character affected me. Yet the film still didn't really strike me as great. Maybe it's a personal thing, maybe not (I'm gay and all of my gay friends love it up, down, and sideways...yet it didn't really do anything for me, emotionally). It may have been the hype. I get the feeling that if I had seen this movie not knowing anything about it, I would have loved it. But, as I sit here typing this, I can say that I just came away from the flick thinking to myself, ""It was good, very well made, but I can sleep at night knowing that I don't really want to see it again.""But it is very well directed. While I don't think it is Best Picture material, I feel that it really showcases Ang Lee's directing ability. This is a man whose films I have watched with a continual fascination. None of his films are the same and they show his versatile storytelling ability. One movie he does features a dreadfully unhappy family, another features gravity-defying martial artists who skip on water, and the other features a big, green goliath dealing with an over-acting goliath named Nick Nolte. I was thrilled that this man directed a film that deals with cowboys in the '60's and treats it with respect. The cinematography is also gorgeous. Kudos. It's a very well-crafted love story and film that people should experience at least once. But, in my case, once is enough.",Brokeback Mountain
1615,lennylou,A mountain of a masterpiece.,10,30 April 2006,"Hailed as breathtaking and an instant classic, Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain based on the sort story by Annie Proulx, with outstanding performances from lead and supporting actors alike, a spectacular yet haunting screenplay, superb cinematography and a beautiful score, certainly does not disappoint. Few can rise from their seats after enduring the 2 hour 14 minute magic that is Brokeback Mountain with their hearts free from pain and their eyes free from tears. Labelled as 'the gay western' this movie pushes all boundaries. Ennis Del Mar (played by Heath Ledger) the mysterious and reserved ranch hand from Riverton spends the summer working for Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) shepherding on Brokeback Mountain with bubbly Texan rodeo cowboy Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal.) Their friendship and feelings toward each other develop over the summer with one drunken night resulting in sex and the wordless revelation of their love. The relationship remains intimate throughout the duration of the summer until life gets in the way, the summer is over and they go their separate ways, to get married and raise a family, leaving behind Brokeback Mountain and a secret love they once shared.Eventually after 4 years the urge to see the man he loves is too much for Twist who arranges a visit. Upon meeting it is clear the passion they once held for each other has only greatened during their parting. However due to a haunting childhood memory and a strict code of masculinity to which he feels he must conform, Ennis Del Mar is not prepared to leave his wife to be with him one true love Jack Twist. Heath Ledgers' portrayal of Del Mar is breathtaking. This demanding complex role is pulled off with consummate expertise. 'Gay cowboys' would be easy to camp up yet Twist and Del Mar are not the stereotypical feminine gay characters you see in Hollywood, but are like real cowboys; as masculine as they get. Having to portray masculine yet gay cowboys, of a time when homosexuality was thought of as a mental illness, demands outstanding skill yet Gyllenhaal and Ledger are flawless. The women of Brokeback Alma Del Mar and Laureen Twist were also performed with remarkable talent, by up and coming young stars Anne Hathaway (The Princess Diaries) and Michelle Williams (Dawsons creek.) All round acting was spectacular. Also spectacular was the cinematography, this movie is simply a casket of beautiful shots, strewn together with beautiful backing music. Twice I noticed the lighting was a little dark but overall it was superb. Makeup and costume departments alike also went all out. Although spanning over 20 years on screen but covering considerably less in real life they managed to turn 4 youthful beautiful stars gradually into the old (and slightly less attractive) you see by the end of the film. Although fantastic this film does have one major fault. It is too fantastic, too heartrending, too moving. Never before have I been to a film and not been able to get the story out of my mind for days after the screen goes black. It is haunting. Though I could not personally relate to any of the characters being neither gay or a cowboy or ever having been in a similar situation, I was indescribably moved. This is a beautiful piece of cinema and a break through for gay acceptance. I only wish that homosexuality was accepted in Jack and Ennis' time, but of course then this movie would not have been created. Go see it, however be warned, you will cry, you will have a pain in your heart and your mind will be possessed by Jack and Ennis' story, but you will also have witnessed what in my opinion is the most stunning film in cinema history.Brokeback Mountain: brilliant, beautiful but heartrendingly haunting.",Brokeback Mountain

It bugged me for hours after I saw it, you feel so emotional, it's like you had your heart broken--you want to cry. It's definitely not a typical chick flick, the theater gave pause before bringing the house lights up at the end of the movie to give people a chance to compose themselves. My buddy has seen it 3 times! Hell, I'll go see it again. My other friends from TV just can't stop talking about it. My neighbor said was so upset that she even dreamed about it and woke up crying. It's that kind of movie--no joke. Ang Lee is infamous for capturing true humanity in his films. Few can do it like him. The story is great--the film is amazing. Why? Because we've been there.

Heath and Jake just didn't make me feel like they wanted to be together at all. they were plain, never really showed intense emotion unless they were beating each other up, and they didn't make me believe they actually missed each other. the movie was drawn out far too long and had very few ""moments"" i could actually enjoy or stay completely awake during. The relationship between the two cowboys also seemed to have sprung up quite suddenly, as before that one night in the tent they hadn't shown anything for each other and all the sudden one of them was saying ""oh! lets have sex now!"" the music also really got on my nerves- the same exact song was played every time they mentioned brokeback, had an emotional moment, or the two men were together. that song haunts me in my dreams. the movie was well shot and had a beautiful backdrop, but important moments like when the father showed heath as a child the dead gay man and when Jake was killed just weren't given enough emphasis. this movie just didn't do it for me and practically made my mom and me fall asleep. sorry, Hollywood foreign press, i just can't agree with you.",Brokeback Mountain

I feel a camaraderie of sorts with the others who were obviously as deeply affected as I was.I have so often said that love is love, regardless of who shares it, and that love and lovers will not be thwarted. Ang Lee showed that love will not be denied. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall made me believe this was their story, not a film, but their real, gritty, hard-edged lives. Their passion and desire, love, angst, anger, confusion, all their emotions, leaped off that screen and blew an entire audience away. My 16-year-old daughter and I witnessed it! There wasn't a dry eye in the house amongst us women. Although no men cried that we could see, they looked as though they'd been gut-punched - they were numb.

The only time they showed any emotion was when they were fighting either with each other (one scene), their father-in-law (one scene), or their wife (one scene).The kissing and 'love' making scenes were forced, almost as if the actors were waiting for their cue from the director, rather than feeling the 'emotion' their characters were supposed to have. Even when they were lying in each other's post-coital arms there was no chemistry between them. These cowboys had obviously spent too long playing poker for any expression to register on their faces. We had to have flash scenes to figure out what they were thinking as they were so deadpan. Randy Quaid on the other hand stole the scenes he had. The leads needed to be more comfortable with the roles they were supposed to be playing, and for me this detracted from the film.Their wives on the other hand handled their parts very well; they conveyed their unspoken suspicions well through their expressions and acting.All that can be said for Ennis is that he learned it would be a good idea to take a day off work for his daughter's wedding.so, four stars for: female leads, cinematography, Randy Quaid",Brokeback Mountain

I guess the fact that it had such a huge impact on me shows how powerful it was. But now I'm going to be depressed for the next couple of days. In my opinion it's a much better (and completely different) movie than ""My Own Private Idaho"" but it left me with that same empty horrible feeling and thinking, ""That poor guy!"".I know they're just movies but it's still so heart breaking to watch.

In a brief telephone conversation, Lureen tells Ennis that Jack died when a tire he was changing exploded. While listening, Ennis imagines Jack being bludgeoned to death by a gang. Jack's actual fate is left ""deliberately ambiguous"".[7] Lureen tells Ennis that Jack wanted to have his ashes scattered on Brokeback Mountain, but she does not know where it is. Ennis travels to meet with Jack's mother and father (Roberta Maxwell and Peter McRobbie), where he offers to take Jack's ashes, but the father declines, preferring to have them interred in a family plot. In Jack's childhood bedroom, Ennis finds the bloodstained shirt he thought he lost on Brokeback Mountain, realizing that Jack kept it hanging with the bloodstained shirt Jack himself wore during that fight. Ennis holds them up to his face, breathing in their scent and silently weeping. Jack's mother allows him to keep the shirts.Later, 19-year-old Alma Jr. (Kate Mara) arrives at her father's trailer with the news that she is engaged. She asks Ennis for his blessing and invites him to the wedding. Ennis asks her if her fiancé really loves her, and she answers that he does. After Alma's departure, Ennis goes to his closet. Hanging on a nail on the door are the shirts with a postcard of Brokeback Mountain tacked above. Now Jack's shirt is tucked inside of Ennis's.

This to me is quite possibly the greatest love story of all time and hopefully will be acknowledged as such. I have read the book and i think the transition from page to screen is flawless.

Jake Gyllanhaal was so believable as a confused straight acting gay male.Michelle Willaims had the homely farm wife down.

I can't believe how much I feel just from having seen a movie, it's incredible. In my eyes it is the best movie that I've ever seen. I think Heath and Jake were wonderful, and I'm glad they chose to take part in Brokeback. Annie Proulx has an amazing mind and I'm glad, also, that she created this story. No one is making movies like Brokeback, it's simplistic and subtle, the material is new, not like anything else being produced.

1629,travlondand16,one of the best films i have ever seen,10,8 January 2006,"OK now I know most of you have heard that this film is the ""gay cowboy movie"", but it is so much more than that. The feelings that the two characters, Jack and Ennis have for each other over their twenty year relationship is truly felt. The cannot be together not only because of their family obligations but because of the way society is in 1960s Wyoming. When they first meet it seems as though time is still because absolutely no words are spoken between the men.Their first sexual encounter is shot like a fighting scene and the morning after this, the awkwardness between the two resonates throughout the theater. They claim that their tryst was a one night thing and vow for it to never happen again. Yet it does again and again. They cannot help themselves. The love that they have for each other will never go away no matter what happens in their lives. Jack the more charismatic one of the two, would do anything to be with the man he loves, even if it means to give up the family that he has in Texas. While, Ennis the more taciturn and quiet of the two is more realistic. He knows how society will view their relationship and he cannot risk that.You will truly feel for the characters and their pain .They love each other greatly and yet they cannot be together. This is truly a groundbreaking motion picture. It is probably the most true love story I have seen, not only because it shows what love can do to a person's heart, but also what consequences come along with it, no matter who you are.*The performances by all the actors in the film are superb. Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack brings a light to the film. His character shines with the light that a person finds when they are in love.The most amazing performance of all in the movie definitely goes to Heath Ledger who shines as Ennis. He brings a very mysterious and confused character to life. Heath becomes the character, he embodies it fully, making you wonder if the real heath will ever return once the movie ends.When he is on the screen you can feel the pain that he has for loving a person who society will not allow you to be with and the heartache that goes along with having to keep that great love a secret. This film is truly of the best films of the 21st century and hopefully these wonderful performances, along with the film itself (from Heath Ledger,Jake Gyllenhall, Michelle Willaims and Anne Hatahaway, along with the amazing screen writing by Dianna Ossana and Larry McMurtry, the epic direction of Ang Lee and the beautiful short story by Annie Proulx from which this film was adapted)will be remembered for a lifetime.",Brokeback Mountain
1630,enchanted_raven,Not one to watch on a DVD night.,5,24 May 2006,"In all honesty, this movie is not for the impatient. The storyline focuses on what is supposed to be a forbidden love but little of this actually makes the film. The movie is overly long and doesn't really go anywhere. It seems that the film should have a much longer and more complex storyline but most of the important parts have been edited out, leaving a bland and slow moving shell of a film. On the plus side I have seen very few other movies that can challenge the character development this movie has.In conclusion, if you are a movie fanatic that appreciates cinematography and complex characters, you will acknowledge this movie as being a truly great movie. On the other hand if you are one of those people who just enjoys a good storyline, with a reasonable pace and a bit of pizazz, this movie is certainly not for you. Finally I don't believe that this film will go down in movie history, however it can be said that it is a landmark for the gay community.",Brokeback Mountain
1631,playerqueen_,Pure Brilliance,10,20 September 2007,"I have never before felt the need to post a comment on any movie, but this film touched me in a way that left me aching and haunted and filled with sorrow and sympathy for Ennis and Jack. I'm the first to admit that I cry easily watching movies, but BBM left me beyond tears. This isn't a ""gay"" film, it's a story of the love that all of us dream about, yet few of us will ever find. So amongst the pain that Ennis was left with (that I too felt), I was hit with raw envy. Such is the power of love, regardless of gender. Heath Ledger's portrayal of Ennis completely took my breath away; I had seen him in several other movies, but not once did he leave such an impression. He went past acting, and actually became Ennis. Jake's part was no less amazing, and, in some ways, I believe he had the harder role. But, like Heath, he carried it off beautifully. For that is perhaps the only word that can be used to describe this film.",Brokeback Mountain
1632,ale_e11,Its not that good,3,12 March 2006,"I don't see what's the big deal about Brokeback Mountain.. Now I understand why Crash won the best film on the Oscars, because it deserves it more than Ang Lee's film. The script isn't that amazing, and most of all, the movie is so predictable. The first hour was good,but then everything turns so slow and boring. The best things on the movie are the photography (they deserve this Oscar), the music, Jake,Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway... But anyways, this is just my opinion, if you're really interested on watching this one, wait for the DVD, for me its just a rental, don't worth your money for watching on the big screen",Brokeback Mountain
1633,thankgoditstrip,"Emotional, heartbreaking",10,15 January 2006,"This movie struck me right in the heart, leaving a metaphorical scar. I was amazed by the superb portrayal of two men who loved each other in a society where it was forbidden. It's one of those films where you leave and it stays in your head for days, and even the mere thought of certain scenes in the movie gives you goosebumps. The movie had dazzling cinematography and the vistas never get old. Heath Ledger gives an Oscar worthy performance, and the rest of the cast is no exception. The soundtrack is amazing, and the dialogue never seems cheesy or written. From the way the characters make you feel with just eye contact, says it all. This movie is in no way distasteful on the subject matter. The storytelling is very unique in that it is not narrated or has captions for any of the scenes, it just sort of glides along -- one complaint friends of mine had when watching the film was that it was monotone, it just stays at the same pace. But with Ang Lee's other Oscar nominated film, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, it's that mood that he sets that creates such an atmosphere that lingers. Guilty conscience, anyone?",Brokeback Mountain
1634,Layla33,"Good, but not great",6,8 January 2006,"I just saw the movie and although I think it is a pretty good movie, I fail to see what is the big huge fan fair of it. I don't think the movie or the even the story line was that fantastic. What am I missing? This is a movie about bi-sexual men who happen to have hooked up sexually and continued to see each other over the course of thirty years. They still dated women, had sex with women and procreated. I never got the feeling that they didn't like women or were not attracted to women. That is where my confusion comes in about ""a gay movie"". I also believe that ""E"" was not homosexual, as he had a situation happen in the woods while away from everyone else, he was horny and he took advantage of it. I really believe that if he had never had an experience with Josh would he have had relations with men. Ang Lee did a good job filming and directing this movie. It was not ground-breaking to me, other than to tell a story about men having sexual/romantic relationships in a time when it was taboo.Other things that were not so great. The death of Josh and the entire shirt symbolism. It could have just been done a little better, it took away from the movie. Also, the move seemed to drag at times, and there just could have been more movement to the film to deal more intrinsically with the topic.Overall observation: The hoopla is the whole crowd and peer pressure phenomena. One person sees the film, goes crazy over it and people follow suit. The movie is above average, but definitely not the greatest film you will ever see or even on this subject matter.",Brokeback Mountain
1635,eec1225,Utterly Brilliant,10,30 January 2006,"The true marking of a great film is how it stays with you long after you have vacated the theater. Less than twelve hours after seeing Brokeback Mountain, it haunts me like no other film I have seen in recent memory. The film represents an uncompromising vision of unfiltered passion and unparalleled love I feel has yet to previously radiate from the screen as transparently as it does here. The film works because it touches some level or another inside all us. No matter the viewer's orientation, everyone can somehow relate in some fashion or another. It's brutal, it's honest, and it represents the struggle of love and hope and perseverance long since overdue in modern cinema. A true masterpiece.",Brokeback Mountain

A few things bothered me; 1. I couldn't understand half of what Heath Leger's character was saying, i.e. garbled, etc. 2. I couldn't understand why they loved each other really. 3. I'm not sure how Jack's character died or if they audience is supposed to have e.s.p.I loved Ang Lee's Ice Storm so much more than this. This movie really had little to do with being gay but more to do with the drudgery of being straight and living a ""normal"" life in barren towns. The whole setting is both beautiful (the mountain) and dismal (the town). The audience is supposed to believe the twenty year span and lack of aging in these actors.The cast was excellent but the movie is flawed. It really could have been good if it hadn't turned superficial towards the end.",Brokeback Mountain
1637,manics,One of the greatest love stories in film history,10,31 January 2006,"I've been looking forward to see this movie since last September when it was first premiere at Venice Film Festival in my country and I wanted so bad to go watching at least one screening but I didn't manage, so I read Anne Proulx's book which increased even more my interest.And eventually last weekend it was released in Italy and I went see on Saturday early matinée show and then again on Sunday with a couple of close friends and on Tuesday with my dearest best friend but since the very first screening my mind, my soul and all of my senses I guess had been completely blown away by one of the most real, intense, sincere, yearning, sweetest and deepest love story ever seen and told on the big screen. In the last five days I've kept thinking about BBM day and night, at work, at home, every time everywhere cause I was melted down by their amazing performances, I cannot shake and get out of my head Ennis and Jack's faces, the way they hugged, they way they embraced each other the first time in the tent, how they couldn't avoid to kiss and touch their faces so passionately when they re-met after 4 years, how they talked and chatted and joked when they had the chance to meet up, how tender and true their love was and sad and desperate ended to be. I'd like to personally thank and hug Ang, Heath and Jake and all the others who made possible such a stunning and breathtaking masterpiece!",Brokeback Mountain
1638,ebaslayer17,when Heath Ledger mentioned Brokeback Mountain on the phone,6,27 February 2006,"Just visited the cinema and saw ""BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN"" today. After seeing it, my friends told me,""this movie's not really special, did it really deserve to win more than 100 awards?"". From my point of view, i just don't care did ""Brokeback Mountain"" deserve all these awards, all I know is it was quite good (a quite good movie). Heath Ledger's performance is quite impressed, he seem to be really grown up when comparing to his old movies. Although Jake Gyllenhaal dosen't really look like a 39 years-old man, but in the movie, he and Heath did act like they love each other and really want to be together. Most people say Michelle Williams did a brilliant job, i think she's average. And last but not least, Anne Hathaway playing a 40 year-old woman maybe a joke to you, but check out the moment when she talked on the phone with Heath Ledger about Jake's death. She's claim and little bit of cruel and with few tears when Heath mentioned the ""Brokeback Mountain""(his husband's favourite place). It's quite touching. And Anne played it quite well!",Brokeback Mountain

The way Ang uses the sights and sounds of his amazing settings, the earnest performances of the leads that make you forget who they are off-screen, the conclusion that you don't want to acknowledge is approaching...these factors and more combine to create a story of so much love and beauty and sadness that I, for one, cried (and think crying in Beaches but times 10) from 15 minutes before until 15 minutes after the end of the film.Irrepressibly beautiful.

1640,fanetta,"More than a ""gay cowboy"" movie ... much more.",10,16 January 2006,"For all of those people out there who didn't like Brokeback Mountain, I guess that we saw two completely different movies. To sum this movie up in a few words, it made my heart hurt. This movie makes you think about your life and makes you ask yourself three very important questions. 1) Have you ever loved someone this honestly? 2) Has anyone ever loved you this honestly? And 3) What would you do in Ennis and Jack's situation? I saw Brokeback Mountain on Saturday, purchased the short story on Saturday, read the story on Saturday and I am still haunted by this story. I will occasionally be thinking about nothing really and then all of a sudden, a scene will start running through my head. It seems like a memory to me, but I know that it's from the movie and not from my actual life. Or a snapshot will appear and I'll immediately start to hear the Willie Nelson song, ""He was a friend of mine"". And yes, the movie did make me cry. This movie deserves every award and every great thing that anyone has said and will say about it! This movie was wrongly dubbed ""that gay cowboy movie"" when really, this movie is a true American love story. I only hope that for even just an instant moment in my life, I will be able to have what Ennis and Jack had.UPDATE:I saw Brokeback Mountain for the second time last night and this movie gets better the more you see it. For some reason there was a mother with a small child in the theatre and a older couple in front of me who decided to narrate the entire movie to one another, but other than that it was a great time. I found myself dancing along to some of the movie's music and secretly smiling at parts that made no one else laugh. I paid special attention to the music this time and where the music fell in the story. The original score for this movie is beautiful and truly accentuates the sweeping landscapes that Ang Lee has carefully placed into the film. While driving home from the theatre in a blizzard, I realized that life is to short to not tell those around you how much you love them. I think that this is the beauty of this film.",Brokeback Mountain
1641,bonniej,Destined to be a classic,10,16 January 2006,"The basic goal, for every writer or artist or film-maker, is to enable an audience to be transported - even if only for a moment - into the skin of the character being portrayed; to walk the proverbial mile in their shoes. This film comes as close as any I've ever seen to accomplishing that.It is a portrait of despair, linking rare and beautiful moments of incandescent joy, and it should make everyone who sees it question their own beliefs, and ask themselves why, in a world so mired in vicious hatred and mindless violence, so many people can accept vile traits like bigotry and prejudice and holier-than-thou arrogance, but be unable to tolerate love between two consenting adults.Doesn't make sense to me - but what do I know? This film will offend the narrow-minded and the homophobic and generate leers and prurient snickers in those unable to conceive that such a love could be genuine, but for those sufficiently unbiased to see it for what it really is, it just might change lives, for it's not really a fundamental story about gay cowboys or men involved with men.In the final analysis, it's simply a beautiful love story, wrapped in tragedy, not to mention an exercise in bravery for those who created and performed it. Ledger is brilliant, IMHO, but Gyllenhaal is absolutely radiant; it's undoubtedly the best thing either of them have ever done.A true tour de force.",Brokeback Mountain
1642,clr1964,Ennis' last words...,10,15 June 2006,"Brokeback Mountain is the best film I've ever seen! This is probably the most honest portrayal of two men who meet and fall in love. My hope is that a story of this type would be told where it ends happily, with both people living out their lives together. I happily imagined how their lives could have been if Ennis had taken Jack up on his offer to get a ranch and have a good life together. One thing that I could not make out were the last words Ennis spoke when he was standing at the closet door after he buttoned Jack's shirt & straightened the postcard. I turned the volume up & leaned in to listen, to no avail. What did Ennis say???",Brokeback Mountain
1643,Woohoo18,Question About Jacks Death,8,17 January 2006,"OK, this is my very first message board EVER! I loved this movie, it was a nice fresh of breath air comparing to other gay theme films. I would go into it but as i have read, i seen others have already. What i wanted to know is, after reading the short story and seeing the film. Does Ennis THINK Jack died that way or what his wife was saying is true?? I talked to different people and they given me different responses. The way i read it from the story, its the same as the movie when Ennis is on the phone BUT he THINKS he got killed by others. I don't know just the way it was done in the movie, it seemed as though he dies by others killing him but it could have been Ennis thinking it only. I was not sure about it. All i know is with this movie, it stayed in my mind for DAYS, even the MUSIC! A movie setup so SIMPLE and yet is MORE complicated than it really is. That is what i LOVED about it the most. It set so much boundaries and leaves you open to discussion about so many things from politics, to the 60's to, well, LOVE. ALl i know is it won for best picture at the golden globes and i HOPE it wins the same for the academy awards as well.Also, is it just me, or did Heaths accent remind u of SlingBlades character??What do YA'LL ThinK??",Brokeback Mountain
1644,dreamyseahorse,It's okay to dislike this movie. Really.,4,31 March 2006,"Before I say anything else, I have to get out here first that I have nothing at all against homosexuals. I have a gay friend and a bisexual friend. I have seen the Oscars and heard wonderful things about this movie, so I was eager to watch it. Unfortunately, I feel I must have seen a different movie than everyone else did! This movie was...boring. I have a fairly high boring tolerance, if I feel like there's a reason for it, like dramatic tension. However, this movie just seemed very long, and the plot meandered endlessly. At times I wondered if there was a plot. It mostly seemed concerned with Jack and Ennis having a difficult time scheduling times to sleep together.Another thing that bothered me was, well, Jack and Ennis. There was never a time that I wasn't painfully aware that Ledger and Gyllenhaal are both very very straight young men. There was little chemistry between them, and the love scenes were very forced. They also were very abusive and unlikeable- frankly I didn't care when Jack was killed because, if you sleep around with married people (straight or not) you're going to make people angry. I felt as if I were gay, I would have been offended at this representation of my life. You're going to hate me for this, but I found Robin Williams and Nathan Lane in The Birdcage to be a much more sympathetic gay couple. Sure they were stereotypically flamboyant, but you could believe that they LOVED each other. Portraying a gay couple as sex-crazed monsters is in poor taste, in my opinion.So, there's my two cents' worth. Most people will probably check that it was ""unhelpful"" if they loved this movie, but this is not for them. After seeing 8 pages of gushing reviews (and not seeing more, because I gave up) I thought I should write a little something to let others like me know that it's not just them.",Brokeback Mountain

We thought possibly he was discovered at the cabin and as powerful as his father-in-law was, maybe they played a role in Jack's death. Excellent movie, my wife and I both really enjoyed it. The movie was very thought provoking and we are still discussing it after having seen it Saturday night. I was expecting a real tear jerker after having read some of the reviews. It was very moving and emotional but not as much as I expected. Is the short story that the movie is based on available in print? I would be curious to see how it compares to the movie version.",Brokeback Mountain
1646,brettthomas,"Best Film, with a power unlike any other",10,3 February 2006,"I could not have imagined that a little 30 page short story by a writer I'd never heard of could reach that deep inside me and stir emotions I'd thought I'd left behind. Annie Proulx's ""Brokeback Mountain"" is so spare, so clean, and so brutal in its unflinching look at the lives of these two men that is hardly seems filmable. For years, that deterred people, until a brilliant team of screenwriters, director and actors made the most perfect film adaptation I've seen.The film is a small miracle - a gay film that isn't about gay men, a love story about men unable to love, a tragedy that rests on a mythically perfect time and place that we can never recover. Why would I feel so strongly about a film that doesn't depict my life - I'm out, I've been in a relationship for 15 years, I have supportive family, friends, and coworkers. I have the prospects Ennis and Jack lacked, I have the freedom they dreamed of, and yet... I'm obsessed with this story.For one thing, I see affection between men - real intimacy, not the usual movie romance that rings so false. I see LOVE between men who are just trying to get through life, figure out their feelings, make things work. I see, and I think the heterosexual world FINALLY sees, that love is what matters, that life holds the same challenges for all of us. How many people hear Jack's dream ""Listen. I'm thinking, tell you what, if you and me had a little ranch together, little cow and calf operation, your horses, it'd be some sweet life"" and think, ""Hey, that's my dream too.""

I read the book before i saw the film but i was not all that impressed with the story. However i still wished to see the film and i found that it was so well done and captured the true essence for as to what the story was about. I found that the movie did not project a gay image but showed a true love story that was neither corny or pointless. The performances were undeniably, and i have never seen a film in which Heath Ledger has done a better job than in this one. He absorbed the role of Ennis Del Mar wonderfully and captured the most important part of who Ennis was. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance was wonderfully done also. he brought laughter to the more serious parts of the movie without destroying what the movie is about. He said the things that Ennis could not. I have now bought the story and i have a much greater love for it than i did originally.

Like in all his other films the casting and cinematography have been spot on.The most special thing about this film was that it was more than just about gay cowboys. It was about life and the journey we lead. The film was slow and sombre, which encapsulated the paths the two journeymen had. Additionally, the roles were filled magnificently through Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall.Watch this film. It is enjoyable and different. I hope this does receive an Oscar as the film was solid in all departments of film making.",Brokeback Mountain

If you have an open mind and can see past the whole gay issue you will see this movie for what it truly is a story about true love. The effect of their love on their lives and families. This is a fine crafted masterpiece. Ang in my opinion more than made up for the Hulk thing he brought out. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!!!! If you miss this movie you will miss a great performance by all actors involved Heath especially turned a tour de force that should garner him an Oscar and Jake the much needed recognition he deserves.,Brokeback Mountain
1650,elway137,Just A Bad Movie....,1,28 July 2006,"This movie starts out slow and continues slow....it doesn't even follow the book which it was based on really as in it, One of the cowboys rapes the other...however in the movie Jake Gyllenhal is not raped but instead he willingly accepts the sex....the movie moves slow with horrible dialog including the morning after the first time they supposedly ""make love"" in which Heath Ledger states the fact he ""Ain't no queer"" and Jake Gyllenhal responds with what is basically a yeah, me too kind of statement. Jake Gyllenhal and Heath Ledger are both very talented actors, and they did deserve to get an Oscar Nod for a movie they were in...just not this one...all the way up to the end after Jake dies and Heath lives on to say that ""Ain't None of us queers."" Which is horrible dialog! As, the word queer, means out of the ordinary, and it is out of the ordinary for a man to put his private parts in another man. I have nothing against gays, I have quite a few friends that are gay in fact.

1651,sjcplfrank,This is the reason movies are made.,10,18 January 2006,"When the title ""Brokeback Mountain"" first appeared on the screen I took a long and drawn-out breath. I was finally seeing my most eagerly anticipated film of the season! I think that breath was the last breath I took until after I left the theater. The movie was simply amazing. From the sweeping cinematography to the heart wrenching tale of forbidden love, the film is a masterpiece. In a way that few film have ever touched me on this level, I was numb from the experience the entire weekend.The tag-line from the film says it all, ""love is a force of nature"". This beautiful film erases stereotypes and transcends sexuality and class to tell a story that any audience member can relate to. Director Ang Lee has made a touching film that will go down in cinematic history, not just for its brave subject matter but as one of the most romantic films of all time.The film is based on the short story by award winning author Annie Proulx. I started to read the book last summer but opted to wait so I would be emotionally surprised by the film. If you are like me you'll want to listen to the haunting soundtrack over and over again to remind yourself of this unbelievable movie experience. Brokeback Mountain has left a mark on me that I won't soon forget and for me is the very reason why movies are me.",Brokeback Mountain
1652,mixtli07,strong and moving love movie,10,1 March 2006,"I went to see this picture trying no to be biased by the two comments that I've heard about it (that it was too slow and that the music and the natural scenery were greats) none of them related directly with the story itself. In fact, the incidental music is superb, as well as the photography. They both captured the very essence of the quietness and loneliness that one might experience up on those mountains. I think these two factors combined with the strong and moving performances of Ledger, Gyllenhal, Williams and Jack Twist's wife (sorry, I don't recall her name) helped made this film the fine jewel it is. The inability of the two characters to overcome their own borders and limitations (because I think not only Ennis was reluctant to free himself to what his heart asked him to do, but also Jack, who in his own open way could not understand the fragile nature of his beloved) reminded me that of The Madison Bridges. There could not be any other end to that sad story (n my opinion). Their love was kind of sealed by the torture of not being able to be openly enjoyed. Finally, I guess must of people would agree on the fact that along the movie one could perfectly feel the presence of the Rocky Mountains as another character, an oppressive one, but definitely another important participant on the film. PS One of my favorites parts was when Ennis was waiting Jack's arrival. When he finally did, the smile of Ennis face said it all, there was no need to talk (and as in many parts of the movie, silences were as important as conversations). Another favorite part, the final goodbye in front of Brokemountain: good dialogs and excellent performances of both actors. And last but not least: the shirt scene at Jack's folks house. This is a great movie, one that stays within the spirit.",Brokeback Mountain
1653,bigmoosie,Best Performance?,9,15 March 2006,"I honestly thought Heath Ledger's and Michelle Williams' performances were overrated. I thought Jake Gyllenhal stole the show. He was the character that had a personality and the one character i actually cared about. I thought it was a career performance and it is not necessarily overlooked, but under-appreciated. Granted he did get his Best Supporting Actor nomination, but I really think he didn't get the credit that he deserved for this picture. Furthermore, I still don't get why everyone in the world is so in love with Michelle Williams' performance. She was barely in the movie, and basically did the same thing in every scene after they got married. She played the pouting wife role, but really didn't get a charge out of me like actresses such as Rachel Weisz or Mario Bello.",Brokeback Mountain

For me its really hard to express my emotions (like getting me to cry and stuff like that) but... The movie broke me. In the literal meaning of those words. The whole story and the way it was shown really got to me. And I really couldn't imagine that a movie could bring so many feelings out but this movie was in every way amazing and heartbreaking at the same time. And i really just wanna say that if anybody want to see the movie DO IT. It will bring the best and the worst feelings out of you. Its so complicated and at the same time so realistic and painfully good that it really left me speechless.,Brokeback Mountain

There is something in the way Ennis Del Mar runs down his flight of stairs after not seeing his love, Jack, for four years, and kisses him hard. ""That thing got a hold of them."" I felt as though I went through what Jack and Ennis went through, and even though it caused me and is still causing me an immense heart ache, there is beauty in it that makes this movie one of the best movies I have ever had the pleasure to view. If there was one film to portray love, to portray raw passion, this is it. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal mesmerize you and make you question your own life. The cast is perfect, I was very surprised by Anne Hathaway who went through a total transition. I found myself during certain scenes wishing for something as true as this.

1656,llopes-1,Leave your prejudice at home and go and see it.,8,18 February 2006,"I saw the film in Basel, Switzerland. The first evening the film was in town, completely full room. Adolescents, couples, older and younger. All there to see a film about a secretive relationship, a forbidden one between two men. I heard no nervous laughs in the room during the less common scenes of sex and love between two men as a friend had told me she heard in another town. I think most felt like me: the story took me with it. The characters are well built, strong and simple, their love was real and complete as their suffering with all that prejudice stuck in deep ignorance. They also suffered and made people suffer around them for trying so hard to live the so called ""normal"" lives. I believe this film may help many people to realise that homosexual relationships can be as beautiful and deep as any beautiful and deep heterosexual one and of course as superficial as the later as well. The main difference may be the freedom we all give it to happen and to allow it to be accepted and to grow.

Two rednecks decided to, well, make love to each other instead of the sheep on that Brokeback Mountain. Couldn't see any depth in it. Krissy from London, UK. OK, so my comment is too short. What else can I add. I was pretty bored all the way, thought all characters were rather wooden, and even music was not that good.

Immediately after seeing the trailers for the movie I thought that it would be very good and so a friend and I forked out the ten dollars each to see the movie the following day.The movie began and the beginning failed to capture my attention - a bad sign. However then the movie began to pick up and I actually started to enjoy myself only to have that happy feeling come crashing back down as the movie started to slow down and the characters went their separate ways.Towards the end my friend and I agreed that the movie was getting boring, however we stay in hope that the movie would redeem itself and become interesting. However we both left that cinema that day feeling that we had gone and wasted $20 on an expensive snooze when we could have just gone and got McDonalds before heading down to the lagoon.All in all I Personally found this movie to be nothing more than a way to help yourself get to sleep however I would advise people to go and see it themselves because this movie is one of those movies where you either like it or you don't and it would be worth a shot.",Brokeback Mountain

I finally got the chance to sit and watch this movie without the company of my homophobic husband. I had long anticipated watching this film so much of Hollywood has raved over. I was expecting to see a cinema masterpiece, one in which I would look forward to watching over and over. Instead I am left dumbfounded, trying desperately to comprehend just what it is everyone in Hollywood was up in arms over. It must have gone way over my head. Can someone explain this movie to me?

A man or woman who thinks they are the straightest person on earth could meet someone and fall madly in love. It's a frightening thought to some of us, especially straight men. It can happen the other way, too; a gay person falling in love with the opposite sex.That's one of the things I loved about this movie. It acknowledges that love is love. Anything is possible.It's something that people on extreme ends of the spectrum refuse to admit. Some straight people are so sure they could never ""be that way"" and some gays are just as sure. And I believe there are no absolutes. Love is love is love.",Brokeback Mountain

Amazing acting, amazing storyline. Heath Ledger's best role to date. He and Jake Gyllenhaal were absolutely incredible together. You would have thought it would have been more than a little awkward for them, but they certainly pulled it off. The story draws you in completely, even though the movie is a little long for what it is, but by the end you were wishing there was more. The scenes between the gay cowboys are not awkward at all, and portrayed so softly and elegantly and you could completely see the love between them. Little things from both Ledger and Gyllenhaal just add miles to this movie. Brilliant writing, and I have to say again, amazing acting. More than you could ever expect. See this movie and you'll be thinking about it for days.",Brokeback Mountain
1662,darkstarr62,"Outstanding Writing, Directing, and Acting - Don't miss this film!",10,29 December 2005,"This is a film of few words. Ang Lee and his cast convey in a sentence or two what it takes many others an entire monologue to get across. And the scenery is absolutely breathtaking. Definitely a ""must see"" - This story's impact sneaks up on you hours and even days after you've seen it. This is not a 'gay' film - it's a wrenching love story that just happens to be about two men.Speaking of those two men - get ready for some incredible acting. Jake Gyllenhall and Heath Ledger are both amazing, but this is Heath Ledger's film and his performance has Oscar written all over it! He absolutely embodies a taciturn, introverted Texan of the era. And, the way he swallows his words in hopes you won't really hear him or notice him is dead on. The supporting cast is also outstanding.",Brokeback Mountain

This is an amazing movie which affected me greatly and I encourage everyone to see it...at least once. The performances by all the actors are obviously incredible.

I think that love is beautiful whether it's between a man and a woman or the same sex. I have to say that it has touched me deeply. I cannot help but cry every time I watched the movie. I can literally feel the pain that the two main characters gone through. Why? Like the two characters I am afraid to be who I am and to express how I feel about the one I love. Imagine not being able to openly being with the one you love because of fear and what society think that it's wrong. Heath and Jake did an amazing job as far as bringing out the characters to life. Wonderful performance! What really touches me is the love that the both two characters had for one another. Although they never say the words ""I love you"" but their actions show their true feelings for one another. The two scenes that touches me the most was when Jack said ""I wish I knew how to quit you"" and the two character just held each other. The last scene was when Ernis looked at the shirt in his trailer and was crying. The two scenes clearly show how much both Jack and Ernis love each other without having to say the three words. This movie will always live inside of me for as long as I live. Above all, this movie is purely a love movie and that love can happen anytime. And there's no way to stop two people from having feelings for one another.",Brokeback Mountain

But whats an Oscar worthy movie which has no substance what so ever? Don't waste your time and money on it. I was just curious to see what all the hype was about, now I know it was just a hype to be politically correct. I walked into this movie with a very open mind and was looking forward to it. I waited till the end hoping it will end in a good way but I was left disappointed. No, I have nothing against gay people. And though I can honestly say I was a bit disturbed from some of the scenes I still stuck through it just to see when it will actually get better.

I can honestly say I cannot figure out WHY this movie was nominated for anything, unless it was cinematography. If it weren't for the beautiful scenery, it would not have been worth sitting through at all. (Still think it was a waste of time.) First of all, the pacing was awful. The movie d-r-a-g-g-e-d! Kept looking at my watch to see if it was about over. Second, did anyone else have trouble with the dialog? It was as it Heath Ledger was speaking with a mouth full of marbles. I kept thinking, ""what did he say""? I've never been to a movie with more instances that I simply could not make out what the character was saying. Last of all, there was very little character development at all. These people were all so one dimensional it's not even funny. It's like nothing happened to these guys in their normal lives -- they just lived for the occasional rendezvous. The wives and families might as well have not been there.To sum up in a word -- ""awful"". If the Oscars can't find anything more worthwhile than this to vote for, then we all know it was a very bad year at the movies!",Brokeback Mountain
1667,msmulatto,Worth seeing but highly overrated,6,19 February 2006,"Short but sweet review (with a SPOILER in the second asterisked paragraph):* I didn't buy this love story for one MINUTE. The protagonists' angst-ridden relationship would have been far more believable had this story taken place in, say, the 1940s or '50s rather than the '60s and '70s. All I could think of as I watched these two idiots was, ""Get thee to San Fran or NYC!! Hell, even Austin, Texas, would have better than freaking Wyoming and wherever Twist was living in Texas!"" Why should I feel sorry for a self-pitying, good-for-nothing character like Ennis who was completely unwilling to even attempt to improve his situation?* In order for this to work as some kind of epic, tragic love story, one has to find the love between the characters plausible. I had no problem understanding why Ennis would find Jack appealing, but to me, Ledger's character was just a morose, drunken, incoherent, not terribly bright mush mouth, and I could see no reason that Jack would continue chasing and pining after this fool for 20 years. Nor did I find Ennis's grief especially poignant. I was expecting to weep at the end of this, but I was quite unmoved.* I didn't find the love scenes especially convincing; especially in the second one, which was supposed to be the sensuous, emotionally intense expression of their passion, the actors appeared to be holding back. I think the camera angles and editing were an attempt to compensate for a certain lack of enthusiasm on their part. The scenes between the men and their wives should not have been more explicit than those between the two protagonists.* I gave the movie a 6 for cinematography and for Jake's acting, which was superb, but there's no way in hell that Heath Ledger should win a Best Actor Oscar. His character was remarkably uninteresting, and his performance one-dimensional. I also found Ang Lee's directing overrated. The movie was far longer than it needed to be, and the pacing was painful. Furthermore, the screenplay was second-rate--the chronology was confusing, and there were too many questions left unanswered.Unfortunately, I do think this flick will win Best Film at the Oscars--a travesty!",Brokeback Mountain

1669,timadvancedtech,More Than a Love Story,10,6 January 2016,"No matter how many times I watch this movie (5 or 6 times so far), it evokes every emotion from me, and puts it all on display. To watch these men struggle with themselves, fearing society's violence, really hits home for me, but not because I'm homosexual, but because I'm heterosexual. I've been married to the same woman for nearly 17 years and in that time I've realized that love knows no boundaries. When we are in love, we are in love and even death shall not deter that love. But for a gay man, at least at the time this film released, it is a completely different beast. Having one's life completely torn apart for loving in a way that is unacceptable is simply unacceptable. This film manages to drive this point home in every scene. The film unfolds slowly, and for many it might prove boring, but with each new chapter of Ennis and Jack's socially unacceptable love-affair, we begin to understand the emotional harm we (as society) inflict upon others. Ang Lee does an excellent job of being unapologetic, and he does it without adding unnecessary effects or gimmicks. This film is very direct, abrupt, blunt, and honest. No one is trying to draw you in with special effects, nor with unrealistic imagery. Instead, this film's beauty comes from its simplicity and its wonderful acting. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal's performances are flawless. Some complain about Ledger's mumbling, but I find it to be refreshing due to its realism - this goes back to Lee not trying to seduce you with slapstick, canned romance - the character that Ledger created was perfect, and I've met people that speak even worse than he does, so to those of you that hated Ennis apparently haven't been down South or in the backwoods of rural America. If you want a view into the lives of two lovers going against the grain while trying to maintain a place of acceptance in society, then watch this film. If you can't sit for more than 2 hours without harming yourself, then you might want to go back to watching pointless movies that will do nothing for your life. 10/10 ""There ain't no reins on this one,"" and I'll be watching this movie for years to come.",Brokeback Mountain
1670,agusbear,Why is it so haunting?,10,6 January 2006,"Previews and word of mouth suggested that this film would be a haunting experience, something to be pondered long after experiencing it. Now that I've seen it, I agree and I think one reason for this may be its universality, depicting as it does the human longing for love, but in unconventional circumstances. Another is its masterful use of indirection. The main character's story unfolds in a way that implies in the most subtle way what the movie is about (the corrosive effects of bigotry) while depicting the tragic consequences with the utmost economy. Visually it is beautiful and stark at the same time, creating an effect wholly supportive of the story's themes.The writers, director and the cast will be long remembered for this unique and ground breaking achievement.",Brokeback Mountain

I was actually expecting an average love story ,only well... gay themed. But i was surprised as how much real love and passion is in it, and real people, not those flamboyant gays or that regular love stuff. The love between those guys really does look real. And i don't just mean the kissing scenes and the alone time those two spent, but also the reactions of the characters surrounding them. Michelle (Enis's ex-wife) just seems heartbroken when she sees Jack and Ennis kissing, but we get the feeling that she feels just as betrayed if it were a woman Ennis was cheating on. The affair seems genuine, scratch that, the relationship seems true, but with borders heterosexual couples wouldn't face, which adds originality to the movie and plot, but also drama, and more compassion for the characters.

The pace and editing are perfect and every scene has a purpose and a point. It definitely does not disappoint.... in any way. The soundtrack is excellent and really adds to the emotion portrayed on screen.The way the relationship between Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) has been handled so wonderfully. It really does show the true meaning of love and how it can stand all tests, be they time, distance or environment. Their relationship is so complex and heartfelt. You really connect with the two characters and how they feel for each other; how they handle the feelings and emotions they are going through and their situation. At times, you feel as if you are almost there beside them, feeling the emotions with them.... when they hurt.... you hurt too.... and the hurt is genuine.The images in the movies and scenes shown are just amazing; the camera work is sublime. It is a masterpiece of a film. I came out of the film and thought about it ever since, it has stayed with me. All I can say is go and watch the movie, just go and watch it. I have to wholeheartedly agree with legendary Australian film critic, Margaret Pomeranz, when she said in her review ""Do you know, this is why I go to the movies, for the possibility of seeing something as good as this.""

1673,WileyED,A deeply immoral and overrated film,2,19 April 2006,"Brokeback Mountain is perhaps the most immoral and evil film to come out of Hollywood.The film claims to be a ""love story"" and so do its supporters. But the film preaches an anti-love, anti-marriage and anti-society message throughout its plot.Here's the plot: Two men have a homosexual relationship over a 20 year period. During that time, they marry women and have children. In short, both of the ""heroes"" trick these women and betray the families they have started. Both men make this choice willingly and this Ang Lee film glosses over it as if this is a noble thing to do.As for these two men, there's no true love between them. That's not what their relationship is based on. It is based on lust and lies. Not too unlike this film.",Brokeback Mountain
1674,robertbenoist,The aching emptiness of loss,10,11 January 2006,"Ang Lee's metronomic pacing and the juxtaposition of the sprawling Rockies with the mundane and trivial lives of the protagonists creates a tension which only adds to the depth of emotion unearthed by this masterpiece. It is difficult to add to what has been written both here and by critics worldwide in praise of each aspect of the production. I will single out Heath Ledger who astonishes as a cowboy so constricted by his upbringing and the society which he inhabits that he is unable to understand or rationalise his feelings for Jack. The characterisation of Ennis Del Mar came from a place inhabited by the young Brando and few others. The performance is gut-wrenchingly good. At heart the film is a romance and a deserving successor to Casablanca. The film never descends into the melodrama of the classic weepie (Now Voyager for example) and it is Ang Lee's ability to show the depth of his characters sensibilities which lifts the film from very good to great. It matters not a jot if the film doesn't win awards. The proof of the films staying power will be seen a generation hence when it will still be appreciated as an incredible achievement to be watched again and again. It has certainly joined my Pantheon of the ten best films I have ever seen. Kudos to Ledger/Gyllenhaal/Williams and Hathaway for their bravery in throwing off the shackles of ""safe"" studio roles. Brokeback is uncompromising with its subject matter which is an examination of the human condition. The film transcends labels especially Western or Gay Western. Nothing could be further from the truth.",Brokeback Mountain

I recommend it to anyone.The movie is of a touching love affair and, truly gets its point across. However it has an open ended, ending leaving much to the imagination.At the end of the movie I broke down crying, it was both a cry of pain because of the reality it forces you to face and, a cry of joy for the step that society has taken. It was a cry for the Pain that this mourning man must have felt.It is a provocative movie that portrayed the reality of homosexuality years ago. Much of this hate still exists today and I believe that the movie somehow unknown to me makes you realize that.To conclude my comment I just want to say, see it!!!",Brokeback Mountain

I've loved a lot of people in my life, of different genders and in different ways, often struggling to find my own identity. As much I've wanted to throw societal expectations out the window and simply trust my heart, that isn't always possible, as the movie illustrates. Life is complicated for a lot of us, and more often than not we wind up role-playing parts we don't even understand, wondering where we got lost along the way.

This movie is sure to inspire everyone. Its not really about ""gay cowboys"" as so many people have said but its actually a story of undying love and how much we can love someone. It shows how much someone can mean to us without us ever knowing it. And it taught me to not be afraid to love someone.

1678,veronik_13,unique experience,10,9 February 2006,"I consider myself a great movie-watcher. What happened to me went totally out of control with this movie. It's been three days now, constantly obsessing everybody and myself with everything connected to this LOVE STORY...Legder is absolutely breath- taking...Jake as well...The very fact that I bothered to register and write these few words is already a lot. I watched BBM three times now and cried every single one of them. One of the scenes that stroke me the most, and hasn't been mentioned here is when Ennis talks to his daughter at the end about her getting married. He asks her does her guy love her. When she confirms, for a brief moment there a shadow passes over his face and he looks across the window. He simply wants to make sure (if possible?) that his little girl and her man don't go through the same hell as they did.As Roger Ebert from Chicago Suntimes wisely said, BBM is all about regret and missed opportunities, so a person can easily burst in tears for, say, not joining the marines or something. That's why all of us feel that bittersweet feeling like our hearts are going to just crack...That's why Ennis and Jack feel more real than we actually are.I'm straight and don't even bother to explain to people who haven't seen it that it's not at all a gay-cowboy-agenda-driven movie.Simply, I believe that all of those who didn't get it have either never experienced forbidden or impossible love (and how lucky are they), or they never thought about their own personal regrets...Whatever, I'm just glad that I'm not at all alone in this private chaos of mine that BBM has so unexpectedly caused.

I am not commenting on their performance of gay men and how they were brave to take the role, but rather on how they tried to make their love work and then in the end they were never able to be together. I cried at the end for the fact that the two of them never got to experience unlimited love of each other.

One thing I did notice though, is that many criticized the ending, stereotyping the movie as another tragic LGBTQ movie. The ending, in my opinion, was very true to the entire story, and is really what allows the audience to connect to the tragedy and feel Ennis' loss. Incredible performances by both Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger. Both performances were so excellent I felt as though I was watching reality unfold before my eyes. It truly seemed so natural and the two had excellent chemistry. A very powerful and compelling story as well. It is one that will surely stay with me and my thoughts for a very long time.

First time round my pickiness revolved mainly around the fact that Ang Lee's movie was a little too polite in comparison with E Annie Proulx' short story (which is itself breathtaking, particularly when you remember her persona is that of a mumsie American housewife).However, second viewing has cast this and other reservations of mine to the winds and I now think 1) Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a performance every bit as mesmeric as Heath Ledger's; 2) Anne Hathaway delivers the goods just as much as Michelle Williams - that scene Lureen has with Ennis on the phone was so much more powerful second time round; 3) Fate is inescapably to the fore like a Thomas Hardy novel, and it is the crushing weight of fate that drives the story to its shattering conclusion; and 4), not fully appreciated first time round, is that while Ennis may loath himself he is actually much loved, and in that he will find a degree of salvation.

1683,biringer-1,Brokeback What?,4,6 March 2006,"The hype was incredible for this film, so immensely so that I immediately shied away from it as if it were leperous. Everyone I talked to about told me it was a must see, because ""You're gay, it's such a beautiful love story Joe! You'll love it."" This made me avoid the film altogether. There is nothing worse in the world! Being TOLD that you'll love something before you even see it, because it strikes some cord of similarity for your straight friends some way for them to experience what it's like to go through the torment of being gay. This story was supposedly a ""one of a kind!"" I found it anything but. There seems to be a more common thread or cord in the films being produced about gay men. There are no happy endings, only stories of betrayal, distrust, disgust, addiction or better yet of Disease. I for one am frankly tired of it. I want a happy ending something to empower me not to enrage me. A film that will say with equal presence of mind the difficulties of being gay combined with the awesome power of the individual to overcome these obstacles. I don't need to be wiped with the past views of homosexuality. I know them already. I'm not going to turn to my boyfriend and declare ""Wow what a great film it was gay!"".Instead I'm going to analyze the hell out this film for it's content and the content was depressingly weak. The story was as thin and poorly thought out as the current administration in D.C. is. Hollow, tailored to make Straight Americans look at the homosexuals of this country with pity and empathy. I don't want EMPATHY or PITY. I don't think a lot gay men do, but then again I'm not a typical ""gay man"", not a ""fairy or fem or drag queen"". I'm a guy who is fairly intellectual and well informed and this movie was a shocking blow to everything I think of in regards to the progress that the homosexual community has made over the past 20 years in this country. I do not want the straight community to use this movie as a dividing line, I do not want to be type-cast into the role that Hollywood seems so eager to hand down to me.Thanks Hollywood, but no thanks. Some hairy balls dangling and a few naked shots and some very aggressive kissing scenes do not describe passion for me. I enjoy acting and film and it was beautifully filmed, but the script is weak the characters are even weaker. Gladly the movie did not win the Best Picture Award, it would have been clichéd and a ""Hand-Me"" award. Well at least it made it to the mainstream and for that I hope the straight community enjoys it, but realize that there are many many more movies of this caliber already in existence.",Brokeback Mountain
1684,ScarletProjectionist,Falls short on quality,5,15 March 2006,"I agree with many critics/viewers that this is an important film in terms of content. But good content might write a good story, but not necessarily make a good film, and I hope subsequent filmmakers will make better use of this type of story.My problem with the film is that it was so built-up by advertisements with no results. I knew it was about two cowboys who fall in love while herding and who subsequently carry on a homosexual relationship for years afterward. I came out of the film with no more gripping way to describe it, minus a few undramatic spoilers, and nothing to rave about.I expected, considering the R rating, that the film would take more risks with nudity and sexual situations. I expected the film to show the passion that can exist between two individuals, regardless of sexual orientation, and, in cases like this, show how it develops over time. But I see very little passion; the only 'sex' scene is about 90% editing, 10% passion. After that we only see a few over-the-top kisses and some suggestive behavior that is not atypical of male bonding in general. I guess one just has to take the love between the two men for granted, and I couldn't do that. Indeed I almost wonder if the film further damaged the reputation of homosexual relationships because it skirted facing the real dynamics of the issue while the two men never received any understanding from the other characters.The cinematography was disturbingly ineffective. I've seen postcards that were more compelling. This was a massive blow to my expectations; the filmmaker behind ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", unleashed upon the North American wilderness: I couldn't wait! Yet, the landscapes were too static, the close-ups were too close up, therefore dissolving the opportunity for textual association, and whenever a shot seemed interesting, they'd cut away from it quickly. It made me want to weep: it was that disappointing.Acting was also quite disappointing... I expected a lot more from the leads. It definitely didn't help support my approval for the men's relationship when I was more compelled by, and identified more with, the female characters.Lastly, some people have referred to ""Brokeback Mountain"" as melodrama, comparing it even to Sirk, but it lacks not only Sirk's very sense of image, not to mention his symbolism, but what he called the 'melos' of melodrama which promote how and why lovers and families can come together... nothing like that here, just cold fish, if there are any fish at all. 5 out of 10 stars",Brokeback Mountain
1685,GIIG21,Needs to be seen,10,27 December 2005,"Seldom does a movie come along that is so powerful and so sublime in it's power. If you are not gay you will see and understand the force or one face of it. If you are gay it validates what you have been feeling all you life. This is not the Children's Hour or Cruise'n or any of those films that try to interpret for you a thought or feeling, it is real. It is raw. It is a true to life film captures what can be felt by two men and seldom are allowed to let it come to life. Sure the ending will have the Majority screaming, but what can you expect. We as a whole are not ready for such a film. This film sneaks up behind one and slowly captures. That can make some very uncomfortable. As I watched it, I looked at the faces of the men around me. Some lowered the faces on crucial parts of the film that made me wonder. If you do get a chance to see it please do so. As soon as it comes out get it. You owe it to yourself and and to the people that make these films.",Brokeback Mountain

Brokeback Mountain is really not about those issues at all...this movie is about one man's intense loneliness...a man who doomed himself to a lifetime of loneliness despite the love that was given to him... this movie is near perfect... Jake Gyllenhaal was magnificent... I can't get my head around Heath Ledger's absolutely stunning performance...he almost stole the movie...I hope with this movie he never has to act in another empty & shallow movie ever again... I knew some cowboys...Heath was exactly like them...in mannerisms...the way he walked & kinda slouched over...he lived that part...and when his character (Ennis Del Mar) was allowed to be human for a moment instead of a strong & silent cowboy Ledger was achingly real in showing the vulnerability of that character... if this movie doesn't make you weep after an ending that will haunt you forever then nothing can possibly make you cry...",Brokeback Mountain
1688,Mikecolby,A Great Film with a lot of feeling!!,10,16 January 2006,"I found this movie to be very true to life. Crossing some of my own experiences, it shows the tragedy that can befall you in a gay relationship while trying to conform to society's idea of how you should live.Too many sad relationships have occurred hurting both the participants. I received a letter back from a friend in the military marked DECEASED. It just about kills you. Never to be able to say goodbye or hold that person just once more.How well I remember holding that special person in the night and my heart pounding. We were very Young--about 18--and there were No labels then that we knew of. We just loved each other without any reservations--it was only later that we were labeled--queer. So, like the movie, we met periodically during many years. Both married and had children but were never really fulfilled.",Brokeback Mountain
1689,wicked_pianist03,This movie was totally rad...,9,6 September 2006,"I thought this movie was phenomenal. Most people I know either think that the movie was made to get attention because it was controversial, or there are really ignorant people out there that want to believe being gay is wrong. I am straight, but still thought that this was one of the best love stories I had ever seen. I still feel that way. All the actors blew me away, and the story is fantastic. If you ignore all the garbage surrounding the film and just watch it as a dramatic love story, you should be quite pleased. In a nutshell, the movie moved me. It was amazing. And if the scene where Heath throws Jake into the shed and kisses him doesn't stir something inside you, then I don't know what to say. I loved this movie.",Brokeback Mountain
1690,kviii,"Perfect Film, For Some",10,15 January 2006,"I anticipated the release of ""Brokeback Mountain"" since previewing it when I saw ""A History of Violence"" in October. A little bit of research revealed that the film was being limitedly released on December 9th. Unfortunately, the film was postponed twice in my City, and I was not able to see it until January 6th. By this point, I had been bombarded with such an array of positive reviews that I was afraid the movie would not live up to such a high precedent (this happened also with ""Sideways"" last year; the brilliant film was so reviewed that it became disappointing to everybody who got around to seeing it more than a few weeks after its initial release). It lived entirely up to my expectations, though it is important to note that, while in many important aspects very beautiful, ""Brokeback"" is not necessarily an entertaining film.""Brokeback Mountain"" is, as you have undoubtedly already heard, the harrowing love story of two men, Jack Twist and Ennis del Mar, who unexpectedly fall into a physical relationship one summer, herding sheep. The screenplay was based on the short story of the same title by E Annie. Proulx, and is an almost flawless adaptation. I found the film to be heart-wrenching, the aforesaid lead characters to be unbelievably well acted, and the film to be every bit as ""revolutionary"" as so many critics and reviewers have claimed. However, I would also like to make the appeal that if you are not a particularly analytical person, you do not enter the film wanting to be blown away.It is undeniable that ""Brokeback Mountain"" is, at its foundation, a fairly traditional love story. Though homosexuality is always a daring notion, and ""corrupting"" an archetypal male image such as the ""cowboy"" (which the characters aren't, historically) was extremely daring, these are not the main contributors to the reasons behind the revolutionary nature of this film. Do not see ""Brokeback"" expecting continual on-screen romance, nudity, or tender moments. Twist and del Mar share, relatively, little screen time, and the romantic aspects of their relationship stem not from love letters, roses and an abundance of tender on-screen kisses, but from painful desperation and greedy hunger.Instead, the ""revolution"" as presented of this film is considerably more subtle. It is presented also in two of director Ang Lee's other films in particular, ""the Ice Storm"" and ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."" Both of these films subtly redefine the natural world - the stereotypes of ""family"" and even natural, physical laws. There is little on-screen action in ""Brokeback"", and the pacing is not necessarily entertaining. ""Brokeback Mountain"" instead works at redefining the patterning to a romantic film by using the chronology, instead of the typical Meeting - Complications - Realisation - Physicality to Meeting - Physicality - Complications - Realisation.Again, I want to see this film receiving wild success. It is by far the best movie I have seen from the 2005 film season, and I want everybody to have the opportunity to appreciate it. However, I do not want people to be let down by the film; it is not about gay sex, excessive romance, action or even a truly societal message. ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a beautiful, slow-moving and flawlessly acted and extremely subtle film about two very different people. I rate it here with a perfect mark, but I know that in order to agree with that mark it is important to be more enamored with storytelling and screen writing than with entertainment.",Brokeback Mountain
1691,nicoleanjolie,The most profound movie of out time,10,13 May 2006,"Seeing this movie can change lives. It can open up eyes to love; whether between a man/man, woman/man, woman/woman. Love is the highest of all and this movie shows that love, no matter what form it takes, is what we all search for in our lives. The characters Jack and Ennis bring to life the deepest love that can be had between two people but as love often goes, is not able to live up to it's fullest potential. Because of the time they live in, the cultural stereotypes, Jack and Ennis have to live with the emptiness of not being able to have each other completely. This feeling has been felt between lovers from the beginning of mankind, but in our culture, homophobia makes it even more pronounced and painful. It was hard not to shed tears during the movie for the pain that unrequited love can bring, not just for Jack and Ennis but for the wives who had the unfortunate luck to fall in love with them and the children who didn't understand what they were sensing. No one came out a winner. The beautiful scenery, the score, the incredible actors, all bring life to this story; but Jake and Heath give performances that will forever burn in my mind. I will never forget this movie, how it made me open up my eyes to how love really is; beautiful but painful, tender yet frightening, fulfilling yet leaving you starving and twice as painful for anyone who isn't considered ""normal"". I pray this movie answers questions for people who wonder if ""all"" love is God given, no matter what form it takes.",Brokeback Mountain
1692,fathmless,"Unexpectedly, Nothing New... In A Good Way",10,9 January 2006,"So I went into this movie with a small thrill at the idea of a movie about two of Hollywood's hottest young stars playing a pair of gay cowboys. I thought that it would be worth the waiting in line because they are so attractive. After the trailer, I didn't expect much; lines like ""I wish I knew how to quit you"" (from the trailer) seem almost comical when out of context, after all. I was wrong. I expected to be wowed by the audacity of the filmmakers, but what I found in this movie is something I have seen before: love. In every shot, there is a sense of this enduring, painful, passionate love, something that can be fought but not denied. The actors playing the men are both straight and admitted that some of the more passionate scenes were difficult for them. None of this is detectable to the audience. The story, the setting, and the characters are different, but the love is the same as any other well-done love story can provide. Its shock value should be 0; what was I expecting, after all? I went to the film, looking for cheap thrills, and found something infinitely more profound. Ledger has been rightfully nominated, and if Gyllenhaal could also be nominated, he should be, too. (Ledger is slightly more the star of the film and is thus nominated; also, with his iffy track record of movies, he likely deserves it more, for proving everyone wrong.) This movie will warm your heart and break it, too -- but you'll come out of the theater feeling like you experienced something. Something not about sex, homosexuality, or even cowboys -- it's the love.",Brokeback Mountain
1693,leonieabbott59,romeo and Juliet doesn't compare,9,5 February 2006,"In an age where the average love story is beginning to become extremely tedious in films, Ang Lee's 'Brokeback Mountain' displays the true diversity of love. Despite critical acclaim, i went to see this film with an open mind. I wasn't expecting much, because often films that are hyped like this one are rather disappointing. We have seen Romeo and Juliet done to death by Hollywood. We have seen lovers that are 'destined to be together' despite obvious reasons embedded in society as to why they should not be together. Up until now, however, we have not been presented with a piece of art that so dramatically and empathetically captures the love between human beings of the same sex. Heath Ledger is haunted by the emotions that he has been told are so wrong his whole life. Every time he becomes overwhelmed by his desire, his love, for Jake Gyllenhaals character, he physically and emotionally portrays the inner turmoil that the cowboy feels. So often homosexual men are portrayed to not experience true love. They have their relationships portrayed as nothing but lustrous flings - dirty impulses. Gyllenhaals performance evokes heartfelt desire and reveals a deeper connection in a homosexual relationship than has ever been represented in a film to date.The film is a depiction of the power of love and its shear force on man kind. Be it in a heterosexual relationship, or in a homosexual nature, Ang Lee has captured the true essence of connection between individuals, and the warmth and meaning it can bring to lonely hearts.Don't miss this film",Brokeback Mountain

I don't remember being so much affected by a love story in the movie form since watching Dr. Zhivago for the first time as a dreamy 17 year old. There are scenes in this movie that are so poignant that I literally felt like ""someone was pulling the guts out hand over hand a yard at a time"", to quote Ms. Annie Proulx.Heath Ledger gave an incredible performance.

He hasn't understood anything about the deep truth this film comes up with. People are looking for pleasure everywhere. Maybe they're looking for in the wrong place...What about getting someone and stay with him/her, sticking to it, facing up all the forces of nature that bind us to its laws, with our limitations, but also acting with the powerful weapon called detachment that can set one free and keep one from misunderstanding such a profound message from ""Brokeback Mountain""? And if I still find resources to justify my ""freedom"" (to act as i like), which freedom is this that would create voluntarily problems for itself? I think we nurture our doubts because they justify our weaknesses.

1697,ghwing,"The ""Unhappy Cowboy Flick""",10,19 December 2005,"Derided as the ""Gay Cowboy Flick"" by those who would rather not know the truth, I prefer to call this the ""Unhappy Cowboy Flick"". And a great flick it is, with impressive acting, realistically sparse dialog that communicates mostly by facial expression and body language, beautiful photography, and the overwhelming sense that we have arrived in 1960's Wyoming and are trying hard to get along with its residents, its landscape, and weather. And working hard to herd sheep.As you know from all the reviews, Brokeback Mountain is about two young cowboy co-workers who fall in love and then try harder to unsuccessfully fall out of it. Marriage and kids only makes things worse and rural America does not have place or identity for them.Ang Lee is the director who shows he knows the culture of his setting inside and out. 1960's rural America is portrayed with sensitivity, and the gay element is shown with an insider's insight into the feelings, denials, conflicts, and fears experienced by gays afraid to come to terms with themselves. Heath Ledger as the Ennis De Mar and Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist are incredible in showing us the heart of the matter: Ledger has the harder job and does it better because his is the nonverbal laconic character.The gay angle is deeper than the reviewers and the movie trailer lets on. This film illustrates with devastating impact how an anti-gay society harms its citizens, showing how the main characters have no language to express their feelings, no concept of what it is to be gay, no confidence in themselves, and no realistic hope of being themselves and creating a viable life for themselves. Watching this film hurts terribly for those who have experienced the pains of a love that cannot be seen or known by others. The main characters reveal themselves to be losers in life, and by the end of the movie, we realize with much pain why this happens. It is hard not to reflect while walking out of the theater on the dozens of classmates, relatives, and acquaintances one has who might have become isolated drifters for the same reasons as the two cowboys.The theater I was in (in San Francisco- America's gay safe-haven) was filled with loud unstoppable sobs as the movie wound to its conclusion. Many in the theater have lived the feelings and fears portrayed in the film, making Brokeback Mountain an American gay allegory rather than a mere gay cowboy flick.",Brokeback Mountain
1698,jorge_moret,It was about time.,10,19 December 2005,"I am so happy a film like this is finally OUT (no pun intended) in the mainstream. I have lived in NYC for the past two years after fleeing my country in South America in 2003 and being granted asylum in this country for being a gay man. So I have to smile when I read about gay people being angry because the actors in Brokeback aren't gay in real life, or angry because the studio just wants it to be bankable, or insulted because it's been unfairly dubbed the ""gay cowboy movie""... people, don't you realize that just the fact that it was MADE by a mayor studio is a huge achievement just by itself? That it's on absolutely everybody's mouth? That it's being shown on multiplexes as opposed to just a couple of art houses? That it's the most HONEST and unapologetic interpretation of love between two men on the big screen EVER??? I lived for thirty years, and until two years ago, Ennis del Mar's life in Venezuela. Constantly afraid, constantly lying and constantly hiding who I really was, in a society that considers a homosexual no less than a criminal. Do you know that the police there can arrest you if they see you in the slightest ""homosexual apparent"" act? Like holding hands, or kissing? Do you know that when applying for jobs, companies screen you with health exams to make sure you're not HIV+? I was fired from a job at an ad agency when by boss found out I was gay. I was also kicked out of my condo apartment by the board after they found out. I could never be ""straight acting"" enough. The police ransacked a previous apartment I had shared with two other closet gays after complaints were filed by one of our neighbors, that we were running a ""homosexual sex service""... I guess we just had too many male friends... I'm sorry; I don't want to go on about my life. The point is I come from a place like the US was in the 1950's and 60's. Only it was the 2000's. I'm just happy I'm here now and live in a place where a film like BBM is being raved about and getting awards, and it's out there for everyone to see. And that it is the amazing love story that it is. I was one of those people who were wiping off tears coming out from the theater, and I still get teary-eyed when I talk to people about it a week later. Last night I downloaded the score from the movie and I was practically bawling by the last song ""The Wings"" (that corresponds to the tragic ending of the film). But you know what? I wasn't crying because I was sad; it was because I'm happy that I still have a chance to truly love before my time runs out. Love without fear. Brokeback Mountain is reminding us all that if we want a change in our lives we have to take that risk. And not wait until it's too late. So people, stop whining and bickering and criticizing, and just try to see this film as I see it: a heroic and historic event in the long fight for our basic human right... to love.",Brokeback Mountain
1699,madman101,See it.....,9,27 January 2006,"even if the subject matter makes you uncomfortable. It's a love story....that just happens to be between two men instead of a man and woman. The acting of both leads was wonderful and so seamless. That's reason enough to see this movie. I do think that Heath Ledger will win an Oscar nomination for his depiction of Ennis. These actors took great chances and it paid off. The cinematography was beautiful and the story rang true of the time and places. Randy Quaid was unexpected in his role and truly exemplifies the hostility that so many face. Thankfully, there was little nudity to distract from the story but enough for it to ring true for the relationship. The two female leads also deserve recognition for their portrayals of the wives.

I had read Annie Proulx's short story in the ""New Yorker"" years ago and it haunted me as well. What is it about this story? It's a love story that starts out without love--and finishes with a love that never ends. Congratulations to the director and the entire cast, you did a great job. I wish you much success, although with the theme being so ""delicate"", it may have trouble finding a big audience in the U.S. The audience here in Europe, I can say, thought it was great.",Brokeback Mountain
1701,andyciesielski852,Gay films OK?,6,1 September 2006,"Wow, a film about 2 gays in the countryside. Well, not that i watched this by choice, but it was an extremely boring film, with no-one confronting their sexuality except Jack before he died, even the wives just let it all go blindly on.Very slow paced even though it skipped between the years, this film was about 2 hours too long. The animalistic sex scenes where they must play fight first, was so over the top and cheesy i had trouble not laughing my head off. Hats off to Heath Ledger though, he was speaking like he had a mouthful of something, although i'm not sure i want to know what it was.Not a fan of gay anything and this certainly didn't change my mind.Beautifully shot though.",Brokeback Mountain
1702,cullendave,Even better than the book,10,3 December 2005,"Wow. Just about perfect. The film really fleshed out the characters from the book, and I empathized with them more strongly. Enough that I'm not angry at Ennis anymore. I totally understand now why he did it. How he thought he had to.The problem with advance word about great acting is that it was hard not to sit through the first half hour thinking, ""Heath Ledger is doing fine, but 'a revelation'? Not quite getting that."" But gradually I forgot it and by the end I was just in awe of what he had done.And Jake. Just a joy to behold, every moment he was on screen. And that was his job, that was his character. What a wonderful character to light up this movie. Would have been so much darker and flatter without him.The women were great, too, and I'm so glad their characters were expanded. The book focuses on two lives ruined, but you get a powerful sense here of it tearing up all four. Michelle Williams, in particular, is heartbreaking.Oh, God, speaking of heartbreaking. My favorite scene in the book, hands down, was the reunion on the landing after four years--where they were so overcome with seeing each other, they grabbed each other and kissed passionately in broad daylight.It was just as powerful on film, but topped by several others. I guess that says something extraordinary right there. The far-and-away best scene of one of the most beloved stories I have ever read, was bested about three times in the film. Would hardly have thought that possible.SPOILER FOR 2 PARAGRAPHS: The second night they get together out on Brokeback was . . . well, like nothing I've ever seen before, but only in the sense that I've never seen it with men. Picture one of the all-time great romantic moments on film, and then imagine it finally challenged by something just as beautiful, complex and tender with two men. Finally. First time ever ever ever I didn't have to imagine a stand-in for the woman up there.It was just amazing. They had ""gotten together"" in a late-night drunken situation that Ennis was completely unable to deal with in the morning. Or the next evening. He tells Jake he's not queer, that it was a one-time thing and that's that. But he can't stick to it. When he comes into the tent, he's completely at war inside. Trying desperately not to do it, but his heart begging him to finally accept what it feels. It is so hard for him, his struggle is so palpable, and Jack is so perfect with him. God me bawling again just remembering. And their last climactic scene together and what comes after: that is just so intense, slammed me in the skull so hard so many ways one after the other after the other.Just devastating.And I'm not going to say a whole lot here, but I do believe Heath's finest moment comes when Ennis visits Jacks parents and gets some news from his mom. What he doesn't say. What he works so hard to hide. God. That poor, poor man. How can you possibly blame that guy?---So a strange thing happened to me after the film, while Ang Lee was interviewed onstage. (At the Denver Film Fest.) The interview was great. To listen to him is to know you are in the presence of a true artist, whatever you think of this particular film. (Or The Hulk.) Late in the discussion, the Denver Post critic brought up they gay question a couple times, dealing with the gay issue, the gay this the gay that. It was oddly jarring for me. So weird to hear it called a gay film or a gay love story or gay anything. For the last two hours, I had just been lost in an exquisite love story.I know, I know, I have scoffed right here about people saying it's not a gay film: What! It's two men in love having sex. That's called gay. The entire story revolves around the forbiddenness of their love--because it's gay--the whole tragedy is centered on the problem of the men being gay.Yeah, I have said all that. And it's all true. In that sense, it is a gay film, in two distinct and crucial ways. But I'm now seeing the other point of view, too. It's also an aching love story between two people who just happen to be gay.The other great romantic movie of the decade--Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind--was also a gripping love story of two people fighting desperately both for and against their problematic love for each other. But it wasn't a film about a memory-erasing device was it? That was just the vehicle, the problem to present for these two people to fight madly for the love being ripped away from them. Exactly the same thing here.All I know is, that in spite of knowing full well for the two-plus hours that it was the revulsion of homosexuality that was driving these two tragic lovers apart, I truly forgot about it being a gay thing. The love story was just too intense. It didn't matter what was driving these two guys apart, it was just about the intensity of the love between these two guys.So I was literally startled to hear her using the gay word while I was still basking in that afterglow. Maybe because the concept of ""gay love"" is offensive to some part of me that is sick of hearing it distinguished from ""love."" It's exactly the same. For two hours I had not been watching gay love, I had just been watching love. It didn't feel like a gay film. It just felt like home.",Brokeback Mountain
1703,brianrock00,Don't waste your time...,1,30 November 2006,"""Brokeback Mountain"" had a lot of potential, but misses the mark in a lot of ways. In fact, it misses the mark so badly that I'm still left wondering what it's actually about. Is it a story about how men sometimes give into urges that are deemed ""wrong"" or ""unnatural"" by society's standards? Is it a film attempting to show us that love triumphs all, regardless of gender? Or is it simply a character piece detailing one man's slow breakdown as he loses everything by refusing to give into his homosexual urges? I still don't know.When I judge a film, these are the things I look for (in no particular order): 1) Have a point. As I mentioned above, I don't know what the point of the film is, but I'm pretty sure the people who created think they've presented one. Personally, the closest I think it comes is as a character study. However, if it is a character study, then the writer fails his characters. Which leads me to...2) Be well-written. Well-written does not equal Shakespeare. It does not equal elaborate sentences or even perfect grammar. Well-written means creating a story that interests the viewer in some way and writing dialogue that's believable and natural. Where the writer fails is in assuming that we will care about these characters simply because we're watching them or, worse, because they're involved in a homosexual relationship (taboo = interesting). The first 20 minutes of this movie reek of someone who said to himself ""Okay, everybody's waiting for the two guys to get together, but we can't lead with that. So, I'll go through several scenes of ranching, being a cowboy, etc, to set a mood, but I don't need to establish characters or chemistry because everybody already knows they're getting together and are waiting for that to happen."" This lazy attitude continues throughout the entire film straight through to the end when the writer constructs a series of scenes that are the equivalent of a flashing sign that reads ""You should feel sad now."" The characters (and the audience) deserve better.3) Acting. Even great writing can be derailed by bad acting, so you can imagine how mediocre writing suffers. On the whole, the acting isn't bad in this movie. Jake Gyllenhaal has the more interesting character and, as you would expect, does the most with it. What brings this film down, however, is Heath Ledger. First and foremost, Ledger has decided that cowboys in the US in the latter part of the 20th century talked in second-rate John Wayne impressions that require you to mumble and speak without moving your lips. The mash of Ledger's Australian accent and his ""US accent"" results in missing half of what he's saying. Further, he's chosen to play his character as brooding, which apparently is synonymous with sulking (which is synonymous with one-dimensional). Since it's ultimately his story, it's Ledger's responsibility to provide us with a character worth caring for and one that has more texture than his monotonous portrayal provides.4) Does it hold my interest? This is something of a trick question because the fact that I sat through the whole thing would indicate that it did hold my interest. However, the reality is that I watched this movie the way you watch a car accident. You don't really want to look, but you can't look away.Many people have dismissed comments that this movie will ultimately be remembered more for the fact that two of Hollywood's more successful male actors made out on screen than for anything to do with the story, but that's the sad reality. This movie is a blip on the radar only because of the homosexual aspect.

1705,pedrosenande,definitely moving,9,13 December 2005,"I started knowing about this film probably in 2004. I'm from Spain. I came to NYC ending October, just for a couple of months. Was a bit scared about watching this film in USA, since my English is not perfect at all, but after a long wait I decided to come to the theater. I read Proulx's short story before, in Spain, so I was quite exceptic about the result, since the book is marvelous. But as the movie was screening, I simply felt astonished about the story again, the great performance of Mr. Ledger, the photography...amazing. I just have to say it was a dazzling and captivating moment, this movie is really impressive, what a beautiful and sad story. Congratulations to director, cast and crew. Bravo",Brokeback Mountain

It opened today in German movie theaters (yes, we are late as always...) and was completely sold out everywhere straight away. But as we were lucky enough to get tickets for the premiere screening I can say that I am so deeply touched by this huge story that I can't find words. It's NOT about lust, it's NOT about sex, but it's a great dramatic story about two men and their families.

The late Heath Ledger is at his very finest, his soft tone and light skin play games with this viewer, finding it difficult to take their eyes off his manly elements. So much so that I couldn't even tell you the story line, I could however tell you the exact amount of cute little moles and blemishes that cover his perfect body.10/10 for this movie.

It was truly one of the top two movies I've ever seen in all my 36 years. I had read the short story by Annie Proulx twice prior to seeing the film. The movie unfolded exactly as I had pictured the events and characters in my mind. Larry McMurtry and the author did well to portray the harsh lives of two very poor young men who had nothing but the raw beauty of rural Wyoming and themselves to bring them comfort in an otherwise unforgiving time in their lives. I was seriously moved by this movie. You'll find that it will be forever etched in your mind as it tends to haunt you afterward with a bittersweet yearning for that impossible, unfinished love the two men shared. If you have a chance to read the book, do. It will explain some of the scenes in the film that otherwise don't make sense. Seriously - this film will live with you for a long, long time.",Brokeback Mountain

I went in not knowing anything about the movie or story and for 2 hours was transfixed in a singularly heartbreaking tale of unrequited love. The kind of the film that you will keep going back to...because you want to savor and cherish the moments with the desperate hope that we can somehow make time stand still, that we can rewind the characters' lives and have them make different choices and we can bask in wonderful performances (Heath Ledger provides a sensational yet understated study in affection)and the brilliant directing of Ang Lee. Bravo!!",Brokeback Mountain
1710,diaghilev-1,Why did I wait for so long to see it?,10,9 February 2007,"I don't know why! Well, I've finally managed to see Brokeback Montain this week and I couldn't sleep all night. I've had to watch it twice more and I feel like watching it every day. I had never read any comments here about this movie, so I can say I wasn't influenced by anybody  I actually didn't know what to expect. What can I say? It's amazing how my feelings are similar to those of most people here  I just can't get this story out of my head! I was probably a bit skeptical about the effectiveness of this film and its importance in the history of gay-themed pictures, but I've changed my mind completely. Now I do think it's probably one of the most interesting, fascinating and realistic stories about homosexual love ever told on screen. Ang Lee doesn't judge anyone in the story (and every character can be blamed or understood for something) and homosexuality is portrayed in one of its basic aspects: to feel love and desire for someone who is of the same sex. But I also agree with those who think it's not only about homosexuality. Actually this story involves many universal themes: love  of course, but also loneliness, failures, the crosses we have to bear in life, poverty. I feel like crying every time I think about Brokeback Mountain and, adding the great cinematography and the stunning acting from all the main players, I can definitely say it's one of my favorite movies  forever! I've always been melted by love stories (I should mention George Cukor's 'Camille' and Edmund Goulding's 'The Old Maid' among my favorite pictures) but no movie has ever exercised such a lasting impact on me, and I really feel changed after watching it (you know, I'm gay, so it's not about having prejudices against homosexual love). Here are some of my favorite scenes: -the violence and tenderness between Ennis and Jack when they have a fight just before leaving Brokeback Mountain for the first time; -their first kiss after four years  the most moving screen kiss I've ever seen; -their last quarrel, Ennis crying and recognizing the failures of his life but, most of all, the flashback showing Ennis hugging Jack and singing a sort of lullaby and Jack's face while he looks Ennis leaving with his horse  it broke my heart! -from this moment on, everything  Ennis's phone call to Jack's wife, visiting Jack's parents, until his last close up and his tearful promise to his lover. Wonderful, but at the moment I feel as if I'll never be able to ease the pain it has caused to me  it's as if I didn't want to forget anything about it.",Brokeback Mountain
1711,smileyguy-56362,Brokeback Mountain LGBTQ Film Review,9,23 January 2017,"Brokeback Mountain, a 2005 film directed by Ang Lee, tells the story of two young cowboys who, after becoming partners, develop an intimate sexual relationship. This tale stars two men, Ennis del Mar and Jack Twist, played by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, who get a job together herding sheep on Brokeback Mountain. As time passes, the men find themselves emotionally connecting, and after a night of drinking, they have sex in Jack's tent. Despite their night together, both men come to the consensus that they ""are not queer"" and leave the mountain. Having left the mountain, the film shows both men getting married, and having children with women named Alma and Lureen. Several years later, Jack arrives shortly at Ennis's house and the two men embrace while Alma watches from inside. Their trip back to Brokeback prompts Jack to ask Ennis whether they could make a life together, and Ennis remembers an incident from his childhood where a gay man was killed, forcing him to say no to Jack. Finally, the men return to their homes and several years pass before Ennis receives word of Jack's death. Ennis quickly calls Lureen and then takes a trip to Jack's parents' house, allowing him to grieve and receive closure after Jack's passing.Brokeback Mountain is able to reach both heterosexual and LGBTQ audiences extremely well, and has solidified itself as one of the greatest LGBTQ films of all time. Until 2005, films that showed LGBTQ individuals struggled to connect with heterosexual audiences, and many failed in theaters due to this challenging balance. Brokeback embraces this risk and is characterized as a ""universal love story"", in which influential actors bring homosexual struggles into the spotlight. One issue, shown by the relationships Ennis and Jack hold with the outside world, is the presence of homophobia in rural Wyoming. After being caught by Mr. Aguirre, the boss of Brokeback Mountain, the men are fired from their jobs and told that there ""ain't no work"" for them. In addition to this scene, the men are put down by heterosexual father figures in each of their lives ranging from Ennis's father who forces him to see the dead body of a gay man, to Jack's father-in-law who internally decides that Jack is not fit to lead his family, taking his seat at the head of the table and disciplining Jack's child. Ennis is especially effected by this homophobia from a young age, causing him to silence his emotions and express hyper-masculine behavior throughout the film. His masculine behavior acts helps to mask his own sexual desires for Jack, and also helps him conform to the traditional society around him. In an effort to attract heterosexual audiences, Brokeback Mountain models the characters of Ennis and Jack from traditional western cowboy protagonists. Through this comparison, the film is able to reach a broad audience, while still maintaining its focus on the LGBTQ community. Both men marry and have children as was normal of heterosexual cowboys during the 60s. Additionally, the men enforce gender roles by having their wives care for the children while they travel and relax on the mountain. Examining the film according to its historical accuracy produces extremely impressive results showing Ang Lee's mastery in representing the culture of cowboys in the 60s. Many men during this time period engaged in romantic friendships similar to the one shown by Jack and Ennis, and even lived together in an effort to save money. This was tolerated by ranchers because of the extreme need for laborers, but was by no means accepted by the large community. In conclusion, although a small minority of LGBTQ reviewers wanted to see more focus on the relationship and struggle the men go through, the film was widely acclaimed by all audiences and will continue to be a classic for years to come. This film by Ang Lee put a spotlight on the LGBTQ community, opening the eyes of many heterosexual people to the struggle that men like Jack and Ennis dealt with on a daily basis. I respect the film for the large-scale impact it had, but I would not see it again based on the violence shown in many of the sex scenes. These scenes leave the audience confused and therefore takes away from the message that their life-long emotional repression prevents them from expressing themselves in a ""normal"" manner. This film also defies the common thought that all homosexual men need to be flamboyant. Although each man's sexuality is repressed, Ennie and Jack are first and foremost recognized as cowboys, not gay cowboys. Overall this film appeals to a wide audience, yet plays into some stereotypes that take away from the struggle for sexual expression with masculinity. Brokeback Mountain showcases the pain in a lack of acceptance within a society, beneficial to an audience wanting to understand the struggle of a specific population of the LGBT community.",Brokeback Mountain
1712,jamend-77681,Good to appeal to large audiences,7,24 January 2017,"Brokeback Mountain is an academy award winning drama that was released in 2005. It was directed by Ang Lee and based off of a short story with the same name by Annie Proulx. The cast is lead by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. The film also stars Anne Hathaway and Michelle WIlliams. The film begins in the early summer of 1963 in Wyoming. Overall, it is a well made movie that was created to be enjoyed by large audiences. The film tells a story about how love can blossom in the most unlikely of places. Jack Twist (Gyllenhaal) and Ennis Del Mar (Ledger) are both looking for summer work. They come to a ranch owner and he gives them the tasks to tend to the sheep over the summer. As the summer goes on, Ennis and Jack begin to bond closely with each other which eventually leads to a night of lustful passion. This is by no means the last time they act on their mutual attraction and eventually, their boss sees the two of them canoodling and cuts their summer work short. Both men were upset and eventually fought each other which resulted in a bloody nose for Ennis and a bruised jaw for Jack. The two then departed, not to hear from one another for over four years. Over the course of this time, they both married and had children. They made plans to meet up and would continue to have meet in secret.I think overall this is a good film. However, I would not personally say I like it. I feel like however, that it was a film that was made for a heterosexual audience. Jack and Ennis were portrayed as these very macho and masculine men. It was almost as if the two of them would only have sex to fulfill their overactive sex drives that is stereotypical for these types of men. Moreover, Ennis especially is not shown very vulnerable throughout the film; when he is, he is either verbally or physically attacking others around him. The film focused on the problems the two had that would seem prevalent to a straight audience. The two men are both married with kids and we seem them leaving their wives constantly so they can meet up with one another and ""go fishing"". The film seemed to approach it by how their desires for another man affected their marriages rather than how being married affected them since they cannot be with the person they truly cared for. The film expanded on Annie Proulx's short story that focused on the homophobia. It was a terrific step forward for the LGBTQ community to have this film produced; a film made for mass consumption that focused on a same-sex relationship. It brought up many of the problems that homophobia can cause. It was a crippling fear for Ennis; he reveals to Jack that he saw a man who had been brutally and barbarically murdered for being a homosexual. This is part of the reason Ennis is so scared to live with Jack. The film accurately addresses the homophobia people have, but I would have liked for there to have been some moment of revolt against it. Ennis lets his fear control his entire life. Additionally, this film is almost completely historically accurate. The two men lived in a time and place that would not have accepted them for their same-sex love; during the 60's and 70's the west promoted the ideals of the ""masculine man"" and anything less would be criticized and be looked down upon. Homosexuality would not have been accepted in this society, so it makes sense that they would want to keep their mutual attraction to one another a secret. This is shown accurately when Ennis constantly is picking fights and proving his masculinity. Ennis was so insecure about his feelings that he had to be hyper-masculine as an overcorrection. He fights the two bikers at the Fourth of July celebration when they were saying vulgar words, he threatens to hurt Alma when she insinuates what kind of relationship that Jack and him have, and he also tries to beat up a trucker who honks at him. Ennis has some major anger issues that could stem from his inability to live authentically with Jack.However, one aspect might not be completely historically accurate. In 1976, the first gay rodeo was held in Nevada. Jack could have possibly come out of the closet and compete at this event. Throughout the movie, Jack wants to be able to live out his life honestly. I think that it would be a little odd that he would not have participated in gay rodeo event. On the other hand, we are not completely sure if he did identify as gay since he never explicitly expressed as much. Even if he did not consider himself gay, it would make sense for him to still want to go to this rodeo and watch at the very least.",Brokeback Mountain
1713,ericalachman,A beautiful and unforgettable story following a powerful connection between two young cowboys,8,24 January 2017,"Ang Lee's Brokeback Mountain is a truly unforgettable love story that is rocky, deep, and complex. Two young men in search for ranch work meet and find themselves working together on Brokeback Mountain in rural Wyoming, a breathtaking land that takes a hold of both of them and brings them together in a closeness that is unlike any other. The story begins in the summer of 1963 and follows two young men named Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) as they work together herding sheep. There is something immeasurable that emerges between them as more days go by- Something that is strong and dangerous. The two of them wound up in a nearly inseparable bond that is full of passion, lust, and violence. The portrayal of their self-identities versus their desires is beautifully conveyed. Ang Lee superbly illustrates the struggles of the mid 20th century in rural America, exploring the dangers of homophobia. Even though cowboys, which have always been portrayed in Hollywood as masculine John Wayne lookalikes, Lee took on the challenge of capturing the indefinite struggles and potential tragedies that are bound to take hold of two men who defy these stereotypes. What makes the story so powerful is how unique the circumstances are. This film presented a story line that had never been seen in Hollywood before: Two masculine ranchers finding within each other a connection that they ceased to find within anyone else. After the summer that they first meet, they go about their own lives, marrying and having children, only to find themselves unable to stay separated for long. It begins with one postcard, and then one visit, that soon turns into consistent trips back to Brokeback where it all began. Brokeback soon becomes their escape from reality. But they eventually find that holding onto each other's inseparable connection along with their lives back home is harder than either of them imagined. I think this film appeals to the LGBTQ community because it doesn't convey homosexuals as the stereotypical, flamboyant male that Hollywood had repeatedly created throughout the years. The film embodies so much more than a relationship between two men. It embodies how destructive rural homophobia can be, which is a historically accurate conflict that has always manifested itself within American society. The fear of getting caught lingers above both Jack and Ennis and catches up to their rapidly growing connection that only gets stronger as more time goes by. The chilling story delicately displays in one scene or two the harsh impacts of abomination toward homosexuals in this time period. Although some members of the LGBTQ community argue that the film would've been more accurately portrayed if the main characters weren't played by heterosexual Hollywood movie stars, I believe that the actors did an outstanding job emanating the harsh reality of the time period and circumstances. Also, Ang Lee outdid himself not sugarcoating their relationship. Indeed it was risky to show graphic scenes of the two men, as many viewers were offended by some of the scenes in the film. However, graphic scenes are shown among heterosexual couples in Hollywood films regularly. Why should these scenes be any different? Depicting, without sugarcoating the heartbreaking and poignant connection between two young ranchers is what Lee excelled in as a director. He was bold and daring. In terms of visibility, the movie was a huge win for the LGBTQ community simply because everyone knew what the film was touching upon before even seeing it. The actors playing homosexual characters in such a complex, yet touching story was done remarkably. The entire film and everything it embodied was truly memorable.",Brokeback Mountain

1716,tessjon-1,More than a movie... an experience.,10,26 November 2005,"""Brokeback Mountain"" is more than just a movie, or a story; it's an experience. This film will numb you, become branded in your mind, and like a cold, rainy day leave you feeling sad and joyful all at the same time. You will end up caring immensely about these characters, see them as broken human beings no different than ourselves, and be genuinely touched by the sorrows they endure. Expect a slow-moving story that will quietly pull you in, affect you deeply, and then linger and haunt you for days on end.I don't deny that the story revolves around a very controversial theme that will make many people uncomfortable, but if you allow yourself to move beyond this plot vehicle, you will encounter an incredible story of love and friendship that trust me, will pay an enormous dividend.What strikes me as special about this film is its universal take on humanity. Below the surface story, an undercurrent of commonality to what we feel as people  isolation, regret, longing, fear, connection - transcends gender, race, culture, social, or even political identities. And of course the most universal feeling that we all hunger to explore and possess is that of love  this complex emotion that so easily overturns our lives, tempts us to exchange a little of our own souls with someone else, and makes us feel giddy that we belong to somebody that ""gets"" who we are.Like the short story on which it is based, the film presents its story through a series of deeply affecting moments that span the twenty-year relationship of its main characters, Ennis and Jack. These moments, comprised of nothing more than subtle glances, brief facial expressions, and the slightest of body language, felt like lightning flashes to me, discharging their energy so intensely that a hint of truth is suddenly illuminated. And the truth that we glimpse is a simple one: these two men truly love each other and the power and intensity of this unexpected bond is both exhilarating and frightening, and will be so indelibly marked upon their hearts and souls that they will never be the same again, no matter how much they strive to build separate lives of social acceptability. The rest of the film touches upon the tragic consequences of Jack and Ennis' inability to fully embrace or define their yearnings for each other - yearnings that defy categorizing.All in all, ""Brokeback Mountain"" speaks to the wish we all have to be able to rewind our lives, realize a moment of true bliss before us and from that point choose a different path for ourselves. The story will stay with you, and surprisingly, you will want to remain with it, savoring images and words that resonate with melancholic sadness as well as longed-for hope. This is truly a unique film that feels like a giant quilted tapestry of human anguish and frailty in which I freely wrapped myself, not to be suffocated by sorrow, but to find consolation in knowing that my own pains of heart are more common than I thought.",Brokeback Mountain

The few movies I do watch are usually raunchy comedies. So when my girlfriend wanted me to watch BrokeBack Mountain with her, it was no surprise that I never heard about it. All I knew about it was that it was some kind of corny love flick.I mentioned the name of the movie to my friends before watching it. They started laughing and making jokes. After they told me what it was about, I was feeling more than a little reluctant to watch it. But I kept my promise and watched it, and I'm glad I did.This movie was nothing like what I expected. It felt so real, like it could easily happen to anyone. I felt that this was more of a film about regret and emotion rather than gay love. The true moral is, don't try and hide your feelings. Don't refrain from following your emotions simply because you are afraid of what people will think of you.Go see BrokeBack Mountain. Its a great movie and not just another corny drama.

1719,iamlaron,"Brokeback Mountain, it just isn't fair .. .",10,8 January 2006,"I give Brokeback Mountain a rating of 10(excellent) even though I don't consider it perfect in every way. The powerful and extremely well written story itself garners most of that rating but it wouldn't deserve the 10 without an incredibly strong cast to deliver it.In my opinion, Ang Lee & co. did a perfect job of casting the characters. Heath Ledger's portrayal of Enis Del Mar is nothing short of miraculous in his ability to sell his intense, muted pain during every stage of his life. Jake Gyllenhaal got the less demanding character but delivered his performance with equal persuasion. Of the three fantastic female supporting roles, Michelle Williams's brilliant portrayal of Ennis's wife Alma genuinely delivers the full emotional impact of her compromised relationship with Ennis and while all three ladies find their mark, Alma's character is most memorable.Lee's subtle attention to the intimate details of lifestyle, culture, and the inner emotional complexity of the characters reward every patient viewer with a totally authentic viewing experience. This is particularly poignant during Eniss's emotional visit to Jack's parent's home near the end of the film where he discovers his lost shirt from his days with Jack on Brokeback mountain hanging intertwined within Jack's own shirt, both still blood-stained from a tussle on their last day together, hidden in a corner of that barren closet in that tiny, impoverished bedroom overlooking the desolation of lightning flats, Wyoming. I felt my own soul break for them both.In the end, the only people who will not come away from Brokeback Mountain genuinely moved will be those who's own personal issues are too uncomfortably close or who have ice in their veins, but those who have most to gain from seeing it will undoubtedly be those who find a piece of their own story in Brokeback Mountain.",Brokeback Mountain
1720,lindener,The enemy within Yourself,10,12 March 2006,"Finally, after months of waiting in anticipation for BBM, I've seen it here in Germany. And i didn't get disappointed. It's almost everything said about the film and i just can say ""Thank You !"" to Ang Lee, Heath, Jack, Michelle and Anne and the rest of the crew for that amazing experience. I've seen it twice now. The second time in the original version. The emotional impact on me was much stronger at the second seeing, not only due to the original voices. There are so many tiny details, You probably miss at first. The most I liked on that film is, that no character can be seen as a victim or culprit. And unlike many people or critics remark (even here), it DOES matter, that the lovers both are gay men. To replace one of the characters of Ennis or Jack by a female character, would make absolutely no sense. It's a story about a live ""in the closet"", internalized homophobia, self-hatred and therefore a typical gay experience. Romeo and Juliet didn't have any problems with their identity. ""It's Your fault, that I'm like this. I'm nothing', nowhere..."" sobs Ennis and accuses Jack at the same time. In my opinion one of the key sentences in the story. The society not only destroys them physically (gay-bashing), but also by teaching them, to hate, and furthermore, destroy themselves. By the way: gay-bashers are often supposed as being men with hidden homosexual tendencies. Ennis probably could have turned out as one, if he wouldn't have met Jack before. Their first sex in the tent was balancing on a knife's edge for a few seconds, I suppose. What could be more cruel? How can You love somebody, if You hate Yourself?",Brokeback Mountain
1721,wwdarwindo,Brokeback Mountain,10,7 January 2006,"This was a poignant tale artfully done by the director. I am formerly from Wyoming and now live in the Bible Belt. The first thing this movie brought to mind was the IFC documentary, ""The Laramie Project"", discussing the grizzly killing of Matthew Shepard. I recall telling my parents how saddened I was by the killing and all they could say was, ""He was in the wrong place at the wrong time."" I was shocked. All I could say was that this was another human being, someones son, brother, friend and perhaps lover. (It should be noted that the closest place gays can openly meet from Wyoming is Denver, CO). My feelings are live and let live. Another hard hitting documentary is ""Southern Comfort"" a story of the lives of transsexuals.

That is how the movie first sparked my interest. But when the Venice Film Festival came to Milan and the winner of the Leon d'Oro was Brokeback Mountain, I knew I had to see it. The movie is beautiful. The dialogue is raw. The cinematography is breathtaking. The acting is so strong and powerful that I never would have believed that a cast of such young actors would be capable of entirely owning their respective roles. Never before has a movie touched me so deeply and lingered with me for days on end. I have had sleepless nights over this true love story. Though it may be about two men, it is entirely about love. Their passion for one another is so remarkable because it is so original. This is a daring movie that many people probably will not see because it involves two men, but though it revolves around two men it also deals with family, children, prejudice, anger, and a love that overcomes it all. I cannot think of any other movie that should, and hopefully will, sweep the 2005 Oscars. And if you have any desire to learn more about the movie I suggest repeatedly watching the trailer - as I have done to see some of the most memorable cinematic scenes of my life - and/or buying the original story of Brokeback Mountain.",Brokeback Mountain
1723,firth_m-1,"Daring, Haunting, Mesmerizing, and Thought-provoking",10,18 December 2005,"Brokeback Mountain would not be so successful were it not for inspired players at all levels of its production. Vast credit goes to Anne Proulx's sparse and touching original story, Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana's screenplay respectfully true to Proulx's form, Ang Lee's artistic vision, and the stunning actors who represented the time, place, and intention of the story so assiduously. Ang Lee has done some remarkable work: Sense and Sensibility, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, and now this. The variety of genres he has tackled is evidence for an enlightened director, versatile and daring. The scope of the film is very personal, an intimate snapshot of a beautiful and tragic love which the viewer can participate in and relate to his own life in whatever capacity. Jack's and Ennis' love is one of lost opportunity, beginning thunderously and slowly fraying until the threads are gone entirely and cannot be rewoven. Thus virtually anyone can relate to Brokeback Mountain and apply it to any moment or decision in his life that he regrets. Why didn't I go traveling when I got out of college and do something adventurous? Why did I not seize the chance to profess my love to my estranged father before he died? Why did I not appreciate that job when it turned out to be the best experience of my life? Why do I let these joys in life slip by me? What exterior or self- generated barriers prevent me from embracing life without guilt? Thus, Brokeback Mountain provides us with an epic and unique story with an accessibly universal theme: that of longing, regret, and self-affliction. Meanwhile, the movie's rapid temporal changes with almost seamless transitions exemplify that no matter how much time elapses, nothing will improve without a fundamental change in one's psychology. Jack's and Ennis' frustrations are not abated after 20 years in part because of society's intransigent dismissal of gays and concomitantly, Ennis' lack of courage to renounce society's expectations and secure the life he so desires. The actors are phenomenal. Heath Ledger's myriad expressions alternate with extraordinary subtlety and unhindered energy. Ennis' curiosity is lightly etched on his face as he observes Jack from a distance, the growing comfort he feels around Jack is demonstrated by his increasing loquaciousness, the fear and shock of Jack's advances are muttered in incoherent grunts, the shy awakening of his desires are found in his slow approach to the tent, hat tenderly by his side, the frustration that boils into his violent outbursts, and the complete and utter despair at the end. Ennis grows more and more introverted through the years, escaping into his cold shell of depression and guilt. The viewer witnesses the transition from beginning to end, and it is torturous. Ennis and Jack part for the last time by the lake, hurt and unsure of the status of their relationship. Then we are shown an idyllic flashback of an amorous Ennis comforting a serene and tired Jack before one of their partings many years ago, and the contrast between past and present is stark. Ennis no longer luxuriates in their love...he feels it has destroyed him. The failure of Ennis and Jack to agree upon a common future is the underlying tragedy in this film. Even though Jack may feel shoved away by Ennis, the viewer knows Ennis is irrevocably attached to Jack. Their love is mutual, but their ideas are not. Jack desires a permanent life with Ennis, while Ennis deems it impossible. The former's hope and positivity wrestle with the latter's pessimism and fear until they are both destroyed.The movie courageously depicts the raw sexual appeal between the two men, which proves exciting, realistic, and surprisingly tasteful. More importantly, the quality of the acting and the intensity of the story completely overwhelms any feeling of discomfort a squeamish viewer might expect from same-sex intimacy. It is also important to note that their relationship evolves, starting out lustfully and maturing into a tender, caring dependency. Brokeback Mountain smashes erroneous preconceptions of being a film about two cowboys frolicking in the wild. If one has a heart, he/she will recognize this film as perhaps the most romantic film of the year. It jettisons the hackneyed representations of gays in Hollywood through complex characterization, integrity of character, and respect for one another. Ennis stoically fights two filthy roughnecks who make rude comments about ""pussy"" around his wife and two daughters, while Jake lambastes his churlish father-in-law for disrespecting him and his wife at thanksgiving dinner. These are not the kitschy pair of effeminate gays typecast in Hollywood, they are emblems of masculinity true to cowboy lore, which empower them as characters to which wide audiences can relate.Brokeback Mountain is a stirring story with all the ingredients for an epic film. Even the soundtrack is good. Initially i thought it rather repetitive, but the slow strumming of the acoustic guitar truly grew on me. Its incessant return during sensitive moments gracefully accentuated the pangs of loss, hope and pity I shared with the characters. The music is gentle and relentless, a rare combination. I have limitless respect for the creators of this magical story, for having a vision and constructing it with artful precision. The pathos it exudes depressed me for a week, compelling me to see it again with my friends. The subtleties of the expressions and aesthetic moments stood out more clearly the second time, and I was better able to admire the poignant, crafted work of drama that Brokeback Mountain is. Anne Proulx has remarked how dismayed she is that Jack and Ennis have returned to the forefront of her consciousness, having buried their turbulent lives in the novella she wrote for the New Yorker. But with the movie released, they have returned in all their sad splendour. I feel exactly the same way, and I write this review in desperate search of catharsis. Watch the movie.",Brokeback Mountain
1724,dbuechler,Everything everyone said it was and more.,10,6 February 2006,"I cant' say one negative thing about this movie. Extraordinary only begins the long list of superlatives I could use. It has to be the most in-depth character studies on screen that I can recall in many years. Lee, McMurty and Ossana got every bit from Proulx story and got to the very core of these two hurting souls. I couldn't believe the dead silence throughout the film! Except for those moments when one had to laugh or cheer. And some of the visual effects like the electric carving knife made the story that much more real. The combination of director, writers, cinemetographers, actors, and a story of such deep felt love makes one helluva unforgettable film. Rock Solid! What would Ang Lee do with ""Front Runner""? As a middle-aged gay man, I know just exactly what Ennis and Jack were going through. I identified with both of them. There wasn't one false second in the entire film. I never in my life thought I would see a movie about two gay men in love that was real. This one is real.",Brokeback Mountain
1725,Chineseboy68,Wonderful love story between two gay men,9,29 January 2006,"The most touching and influential gay love story in the Hollywood Movies' history. Nowadays, being a gay man is generally more fortunate since people nowadays are more tolerant and some even accept gay cultures without prejudice. But imagine in the 60s and early 70s how difficult it was to accept oneself being gay not mentioning to have a love relationship with another man. Brokeback simply told a love story that explained throughout the movie how difficult, how guilty and how heartbreaking for two men who honestly and truthfully love each other but had to live up to the society's acceptance by getting marry. Neither the two men nor their wives were happy in the end.",Brokeback Mountain

It tops all other romance/tragedy films in my lifetime. Ang Lee is able to accomplish something that film-makers rarely are able: to make the audience genuinely care about the characters. They seem real, because they are believable. We worry about them, because forbidden love that end in tragedy still happen today. And I so appreciate Ang Lee for not turning this into a overt melodramatic tear-jerker. Thank god, he stayed clear away from the Titanicesque sobbing or the Romeo + Juliette screaming/crying that begs audiences' sympathy. Just the silent tears fixed in Ennis' eyes as he strokes the two shirts carefully hung together are powerful rendering of love lost, missed and cherished for life. Love is a force of nature.

1727,shaver8080,A New Kind of Movie,10,20 January 2006,"I didn't want to go see a ""gay love story,"" but I had friends who urged me to see it. I thought the most I would do was see it when it came out on DVD. After repeated attempts to get me to go, one friend was given two passes, called me and said he was taking me as a guest. Brokeback Mountain is one of those films that comes along once a decade. The story is simple, the scenery uncluttered, and the dialog sparse. But the movie speaks volumes. It is joyful. It is powerful. It is sad. It displays passion, anger, grief, violence, and there is an underlying tension that runs non-stop throughout the entire movie. It never falters. I have seen a handful of movies that kept me glued to the screen, and this is one. Most of the audience reacted the same way. The ""gay"" issue suddenly becomes secondary. It becomes a human issue, of confusion, hope, frustration, pain, and of dreams never to be realized. The performances were all good. Some were great. You find yourself wondering, ""Would it have been better if these two had never met each other?"" Those who see the movie will come away with that question answered.",Brokeback Mountain
1728,sexy_kat30,good plot....bad film making,4,25 January 2006,"This film was based on a truly captivating story and had the potential to be a real romance with some key themes explored. Sadly, the film maker, Ang Lee, clearly has no idea how to direct these two talented actors. There were too many quiet scenes that bored the audience thus causing them to forget the feelings involved. This film was supposed to portray the struggles gays had in the 1970's and it did to some extent, but the boring, monotonous tones from Heath Ledger did not convey his sad life properly. Overall there were a few good ideas such as how Jake died, by the bigotts, but this was not explored enough for the audience to fully take in.",Brokeback Mountain
1729,prayer81,The Courage to Follow Your Heart,10,28 December 2005,"This movie has gotten under my skin more than any other has for quite a long time. I believe that people who never would have imagined themselves relating to ""gay cowboys"" will find themselves deeply identifying with the challenges that Ennis (Heath Ledger) and Jack (Jake Gyllenhall) face in this story. Of course it is a story of forbidden love, and as such, it is very powerful. But it also speaks to anyone who has been surprised by something they have found life-altering and profoundly meaningful. It's about mustering the courage to enrich your life by pursuing these things, and it's about what can happen if you can't bring yourself to do so. On that level, I think it's an incredibly universal story. Regardless of your sexual orientation or beliefs, you should challenge yourself to see this movie.",Brokeback Mountain
1730,frank_5718,Best Picture of the Year,10,5 January 2006,"The nights are cold and lonely in the mountains of Wyoming. Two isolated cowboys stumble across a way to take the chill off as ""Brokeback Mountain"" gently unfolds into an epic, heartbreaking love story that's far greater than the sum of its parts.Even while director Ang Lee's magnificent achievement is being reduced to the catchphrase ""the gay cowboy movie,"" ""Brokeback"" is also about the classic American journey and what we've lost along the way, including our diminishing bond with this great land of ours.It's 1963, and two Marlboro men who barely grunt hello apply for a temp job herding sheep. Rodeo rider Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and rugged, Gary Cooper-ish ranch hand Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) are so flat broke that Brokeback is their only option - a thankless job for two with a pup tent for one, and no one to keep them warm.Except each other.Ennis, who speaks few words, conveys plenty. He's been brought up to believe men don't go with men, a lesson reinforced by something horrible he witnessed in his youth.But the nights are cold, the whiskey hot. After an unplanned, energetic tumble with Jack in the pup tent, satisfying a need as primal as that for food, Ennis uses up some of his precious supply of mumbled words: ""I ain't queer, ya know."" Maybe, maybe not. What these two feel is eternal and nameless - even they don't know what it is (although the more adventurous Jack has an inkling). The closest Ennis gets to acknowledging his feelings is when he doubles over and wretches.Brokeback gets them good, as Ennis later remarks.The landscape is vast (it was filmed in Canada), but the neighbors' minds are narrow. So the cowboys go their separate ways, marry and have kids, and lead lives of quiet desperation despite a few quickie reunions back where it all started.Jack and Ennis are victims of their time, and not just sexually. They're cowboys, that iconic figure of American history, but they could well be the last ones, their skills and rough edges increasingly useless in the modern world.The persistent ache in this movie comes from thwarted desire. Forget the sex (and the sex scenes are decorous). The great tragedy is that they leave everything they value back on Brokeback. Ennis trades in the great outdoors for an airless apartment over a laundromat. Jack gives up bucking broncos for motorized farm equipment.Thematically, the movie - adapted from a story by Annie Proulx - fits right in with the upcoming ""The New World,"" in which the bond between Pocahontas and Capt. John Smith is likewise rooted in a shared love of a wild, unruly, rapidly disappearing landscape.Jack and Ennis' feelings transcend anything as mundane as sexual orientation. In fact, the sexiest moment is when Jack doesn't peek as Ennis strips down to wash just yards away.Gyllenhaal is terrific, as are Michelle Williams as Ennis' crushed, bitter wife, and Anne Hathaway as Jack's coldly oblivious one.But the movie belongs to Ledger, who turns in an astonishing, Oscar-worthy performance as a man who knows he's drowning but won't swim. His words choke in his throat from fear of what they might express.Like many of Ang Lee's films (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""), this one drips with longing - in this case, for a vanished breed of man, for the vanished wilderness, and for a pure kind of love that has no label and needs no justification.",Brokeback Mountain
1731,tina_colada,this movie was super good,10,7 May 2006,this movie was awesome. i went to see it with two of my friends and it was amazing. Jake Gyllenhaal is an amazing (and amazingly hot) actor and he deserved to get an Oscar for it. my friend Brittany would like to add that this movie was splendid. we are only 16 years old and we understood this movie and those people who get so worked up about them being gay are just afraid and ignorant. this movie deserved to win the Oscar for best movie because it brought some issues to light and tears to my eyes. i recommend seeing this movie because it is really good and enlightening. and really sexy. and super. and splendid. <- Brittany wrote that. thank you for your time. good day.,Brokeback Mountain
1732,hulie2008,Brokeback mountain; best all around movie of 2005,10,14 January 2006,"Hearing rumors of the ""gay cowboy movie"" i must admit that i very interested in seeing Brokeback Mountain. Waiting an extra month to see it was very unfortunate, as it was one of the best films i have ever seen. Not knowing quite what to expect as i entered the theater, i prayed that this movie wouldn't be as awkward and as pointless as i worried. I was not disappointed. By the end you focus more on what wasn't said rather than what was.The performances put on by Heath Ledger, Michelle Williams and Jake Gyllenhaal are all worthy of Oscars, as each person brought there character to life. Truly these young actors and actress's have not been praised enough for their acting in this movie. I was completely moved to tears at the end. I saw this movie a week ago and i cannot stop thinking about it. My friends and i left the theater and said nothing to each other until we had left the theater; as we were all completely speechless at the movies beauty and genius.Now to me and all who have seen it, Brokeback Mountain is no longer ""the gay cowboy movie"" but instead was a tale of love between to two people; the fact that they were both male only made the movie more moving, and took nothing away from its greatness. To truly appreciate the movie you would have to see it yourself, but for those who have heard of it, and are tempted to view it, don't assume that this movie will bore and disappoint you, because it can connect with any audience and will affect you in such an emotional way, that there will be no words to describe it.This is the only movie i have awarded a 10/10.",Brokeback Mountain
1733,alex-renteria,"Sad, Beautiful, Tradgic, True Love....what happened to JACK??",9,4 February 2006,"An amazing movie. I completely loved this movie, forget that it is a ""gay"" love story and focus on the fact that it is a story about an unforgiving world that hates and is afraid of anything different. The characters had great depth and personality. I love the fact that the story spanned a great deal of Jack and Ennis's lives. Truly, truly tragic...but one thing bugs me...they never quite explain what exactly happens to Jack?!!? In the phone conversation that Ennis has w/ Jack's wife she seems visibly shaken when Ennis says that he is a good friend of Jack's. During the course of this conversation Jack's wife describes how Jack died. The movie then proceeds to cut to scenes of Jack being brutally beaten. Is this Ennis's imagination ( since his father showed him the dead body of another ""gay cowboy"" when he was a child) running wild? Or is this the movie showing us what really happened? The part where Jack is sitting outside the restaurant with that ladies husband and he tells Jack that he has a cabin or something out in the woods somewhere. This makes me think that somehow they were discovered and that Jack was beaten. SOMEONE SHED SOME LIGHT ON THIS. (yes straight guys like this movie too!!)",Brokeback Mountain
1734,wesley-renfro,Amazing,10,14 January 2006,"Although some believe the film is a bit slow moving, it is a rare cinematic expression of the human condition. The love these men share is so deep and powerful. However, they are forced to dismiss their chances of a happy life together because they are gay. I would like to say things could have been different for Jack and Ennis. I am unsure if this is true given the power of fear and anxiety about being homosexual. This is really a cinematic jewel -- anyone who has loved or had a broken heart should see this film. The screenplay is amazing as is the sheer beauty of the Wyoming landscape. It was so moving you could hear people in the audience sobbing and for good reason, it should make you ache for love unfulfilled.",Brokeback Mountain

I just can't erase the pics of the 2 characters playing, loving, fighting, crying & longing for each other. This is the best movie i have seen in my lifetime & all day I think about it. I can't erase the image of Ennis Del Mar, played by Legendary actor late Heath Ledger crying in the arms of his deceased soulmate Jack, sniffing his shirt with moist eyes or saying ""I Swear "" in the end with tears laden eyes. It was a grave mistake of Academy jury to deny the movie the best picture & Heath Ledger the best actor award. If u wanna know what a true love looks like, watch it",Brokeback Mountain
1736,christiengarcia,Universal Love?,10,26 January 2006,"This movie has a haunting sense about it (that is the best word I have found to describe it) and I think Gyllenhaal performance has a lot do with that. As a gay man people might find it obvious that this movie would hit me so profoundly but I think some of these previous comments are a testament to the movie's general cinematic brilliancewhich goes far beyond 'gay appeal'. I do however find all this talk about 'universal love' a bit problematic (and very interesting). Although there is no simple/ultimate distinctness between 'gay' and 'straight' love, no two loves are ever the same and the love that Jake and Ennis shared IS particular to their gender. I believe love is experienced particular to time and space and not simply felt because you happened upon the right person. As such Jake's love is a 'gay love' and their situation is a 'gay situation' (the story depends on them being two men living in rural American at that point in time). So I guess what I'm trying to say is that it bothers me that people always want to forcefully reject its description as a 'gay love story' and insist it is simply a 'love story'. It is in fact a beautiful gay love story and that shouldn't make it any less! Thanks!",Brokeback Mountain

I do wish they would have been able to be together in the movie but I guess this way it sends us a message. A message that says this shouldn't happen, and yes this kind of thing still happens. Its quite sad. My favorite part in this movie would have to be when they finally see each other after four years. My most hated part is when the one wife tells her husband ""friend"" what happened and lied about the whole thing and didn't even flinch.

Such a strong film. I cannot clearly tell why but I simply cannot get it out of my head, being haunted by scenes from the film during the day. I've been feeling absolutely melancholic for two days now. Both Ledger and Gyllenhaal acted so well at such young ages, the look in their eyes, the passion, the melancholy of impossibility, Ennis's innocence and shyness, their determination to carry on... It was all so beautiful. I suppose Ledger not being alive today makes it harder for me.

It's a very touching story and I recommend it to anyone and everyone. I feel like this movie could change a lot of people's minds if they just gave it a chance. It deserves all the appreciation it got and more. Heth Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal did a magnificent job. They really made me believe that they were in love and nothing would keep them apart.

1742,chrono-spark,"Brokeback Mountain, is, without a doubt, a masterpiece",10,5 April 2006,"There was no film before this one that touched me on such an emotional level. By the end of the film I was bawling my eyes out, and for me with films, that's a first. The movie's story is by now well-known: two sheep wranglers (Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar) work together on Brokeback Mountain one summer and develop a relationship with each other that, simply, can never truly be. What I found truly amazing about this movie was that, yes, it is about two gay men, two ""gay cowboys"" as has been described so often of the film. And yet, when I watched the film, I was so entranced by the story and the characters, their lives, what they did, what happened to them, that their sexual orientation was never a question in my mind--it never seemed to matter. That is a stroke of masterwork by the film's director, Ang Lee, who rightly deserved the Oscar (and other awards he received) for this film, as he could have taken an approach to glorify Jack and Ennis' homosexuality. But instead he takes the approach to relate it to anyone: gay or straight. This moving is also the crowning moment for Heath Ledger, who before now, I believe, had never gotten a chance to show his true talent--he does here, and it is simply amazing to watch. Jake Gyllenhaal gives more of his continuing good performances, but he shows a new depth to this part than any of his others. I read the short story before seeing the film, and thought it was decent. I was not expecting the heart-wrenching story I saw. Annie Proulx, (who wrote the original short story) herself admitted that after seeing this film, that, sometimes, ""film can be more powerful than the written word."" Brokeback Mountain, is, without a doubt, a masterpiece, and will be remembered for years to come as a classic.",Brokeback Mountain

In my case it reminded me of my friend Van Eaves. I could tell everyone in the theater was touched and left the theater with a totally different respective on love. Overall it was a good experience to see this movie!

That's the bottom line of the story.

Everything was shot perfectly, the scenery was magnificent, the music was fitting, & the acting really blew me away.

Basically, when you sit in your seat you already know that they're gay cowboys that get married to women later on, but the story is truly captivating. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal don't talk for roughly the first ten minutes of film, except to say their names, so all that the audience is really left with is the beautiful scenery and anticipation of when they're going to hook up (since we know that they will). It's not unbelievable that they do get together, either, as they're left with only each other for weeks and it just seems plausible at the time. When they do...well, it's not rated R for nothing. The rest of the movie is really well done, and it's difficult to really explain the plot. And then it suddenly ends. I was sitting in my seat going ""Huh?"" for a few minutes until I realized, ""Yeah that was actually a good ending"". I've recommended it to everyone that I've talked to, to go and see this movie.

My explicit advice is that the film be seen in an environment that will promote a feeling of intimacy. See it with someone you love. You will willingly bear your heart. You will feel vulnerable.Heath Ledger fully becomes Ennis del Mar. He is wracked by pain, frustration, fear and guilt that never completely leave him. Jake Gyllenhaal fully becomes Jack Twist. He has a kind of hopeful joy you feel you can drink in great healing gulps. But Ennis cannot be completely healed, he can only be temporarily relieved and the anguish that this causes Jack is fully realized through Jake. Ennis' and Jack's love is made fully evident by Heath and Jake in actions and expressions both great and small.The music of Gustavo Santaolalla is pitch perfect and the screenplay of Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana is flawless.I don't feel the need to elaborate on the performances of Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway or the cinematography of Rodrigo Prieto. They were each exceptional and have been praised elsewhere. They were not the focus of my concern although if they had not been so exceptional the film would have been crippled.Please, read the story. But expect to come away from the film with different impressions and understandings. Be prepared to think differently about Jack and Ennis. Be prepared to understand them more fully.I am honestly grateful to Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal and Ang Lee for so lovingly giving Ennis and Jack and their story to us and I will write them to say so.You will be changed by this film.",Brokeback Mountain
1753,tinkerbell412,Left With The Deepest Sadness...,10,30 March 2006,"First of all, can I just say, ""MY GOD"" I haven't seen such a brilliantly made movie since ""MILLION DOLLAR BABY"", even though I do think Brokeback Mountain does surpass Million Dollar Baby, with regards to better acting and just an all around, a better movie. Even though Clint Eastwood is ""THE MAN""! The title of my review expresses exactly how I was feeling when I left the theater.This is the tragic love story of two cowboys who fall in love while in the mountains of Brokeback. With the first love scene, it comes of as an unreasoning or an extravagant passion or attraction, which can be defined as INFATUATION. In the movie, we later on realize that, it's not infatuation at all, but something that goes much deeper. Something many of us don't like to say unless we truly meant it, something we call.... LOVE. Regardless of the fact that it is a love between two men, we as humans should understand because love is a universal emotion which everyone, straight or not, can understand and feel. Brokeback Mountain depicts every emotion we as humans feel; Love...sadness...fear...and anger.I was blown away by the performances of all the cast members including Anne Hathaway, which many people basically forgot was in the movie. Even though I do agree with her not being nominated for an Oscar because her performance was the weakest. Honestly, as hard as it is to say, because Jake Gyllenhaal is my favorite actor EVER and probably one of the most underrated,(Even though people are starting to catch on to him now) although he's been great since DONNIE DARKO. Heath Ledger's performance was stronger and more powerful than Jake's. I feel as though if anyone should've won an Oscar, he should.(Damn u, Capote!). His performance was one of the best performances to ever not win an Oscar in the history of the academy awards. Although these are strong words, they are true. I have never seen Heath act with so much heart and, passion and take on a character who isn't even an embody that fictional character like he did in Brokeback Mountain. Unlike the other actors who were nominated, who had someone who they could mirror and were trying to portray which, is still great. But to become someone who doesn't even exist with such passion and raw talent it would've seemed as though there were really an Ennis del Mar! Now on to Jake and Michelle. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance was incredible as Jack Twist in Brokeback Mountain. But everyone should remember that, just because your not crying in every scene, fighting a cause, or even screaming at people in a dramatic and emotional way, doesn't mean you can't create a powerful performance. Which is exactly what Jake did, he was subtle with a lot of his expressions and feelings, and wasn't aggressive in several scenes. For the main part, Jake was very subtle, to portray a character that was in love with another man, not by choice.Best said in this line,""I anit no queer,"" said Ennis, Jack replies,""me neither."" His facial expressions and body language are priceless in the film, and those are attributes which not everyone possess. During these times an actor's real talent is shown, because its not always about how dramatic you can be.Michelle Williams performance is heartbreaking to watch. She, like Heath, really did a '180'(degree)in terms of the fact that I wasn't really a huge fan of their acting, and they've just done wonders in this film. We get to see her go through the horrible experience of her having to come to terms with the fact that her husband is having an affair, and to make matters worse, with the possibility that he could be gay; with his affair having to be with another man. Also, how every time he goes away to fish with his friend, they are together in more than one way. Michelle's breakdown in the movie was nothing short of incredible and moving. She may not have won the Oscar, but she surely deserved it. But I guess that it all depends on the opinion of the viewers/critics. And finally Ang Lee; Wow. No words can describe how thankful I am to him for making this movie and having the courage to carry on even with all the obstacles he had to face trying to make the movie. Thank you for your genius idea because this movie could've easily been a disaster. Even though Brokeback was snubbed for best picture, they had to give it to you Ang because your directing was nothing short of brilliant.... Thank You with the dearest of appreciation.Going to the movie, I was just expecting a great movie. But now thinking back, this was more than just a great movie. It was one of a kind, and probably will remain that way. I felt, basically, every emotion that Heath , Jake , Michelle , and even Anne felt. This may be a movie about tragedies, but the biggest tragedy was the Oscars showing there true colors; giving the best picture award to a movie that in its own right, was incredible but nowhere near on the same level, and as brilliantly made as Brokeback Mountain. This movie tears at your heart for 2 hrs and 15 mins, and with the way I, and probably many others, felt for many days to come.",Brokeback Mountain
1754,enlooke,"Finally a ""Brokeback Mountain-movie"" has arrived",10,24 October 2005,"Two words seem not to be enough to describe this masterpiece, but here they go: INCREDIBLY FANTASTIC. I was so fortunate to see one of the sessions at Sao Paulo International Film Festival this weekend, so was the rest of the astonished audience that remained sat down when the film ended listening to the song He was a friend of mine"". Ang Lee's direction was so perfect and delicate, that the violence of the cowboy's love could be only a simple and natural reaction to something stronger than any other feeling, stronger than their lives. Nothing less could be expected from someone who gave Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon a poetic sense and sensibility. As the novel begins, we can understand the differences and their common characteristics; both raised in small and poor ranches in opposite American States, Jack in Lightning Flat, near Montana and Ennis near Utah. They abandoned school in a lack of perspective and grew up to the hard work in the country and poverty, both rough in manners and language, but something unlikely to happen transformed their lives in the Summer of 63 and here begins this extraordinary feeling among the most beautiful landscapes and a calm and tender music, which is the main theme of the film. So the season ends and they split but will not deny that feeling. They are to be drowned into a deep and true love throughout the next 20 years. This is far more than a love and passion story, it is a search for breaking all the rules to be true to ourselves, just let it run. Jack's needs, Ennis' fear of starting it all over with his lover. The agony and the glory of this explosion is shown in a way we become witnesses. Ennis blames his lover, for he could never move on his life and failed his marriage. Jack blames himself for never quitting this love. Superb performances, I must say. Every single look of passion, every single touch of affection, every single word of anger, the pain of a tear falling down, the happiness of being together, the anxiety of waiting for another Summer to come, the possible hope of an everlasting love are moments of a lifetime gently shared with us and we are thankful.As the the young actresses performing Ennis and Jack's wives, Anne Hathaway and Michelle Williams (I didn't really like D's Creek at all, but she was far the best part) can show the right picture of a decadent marriage. Alma (Michelle) and Ennis have one the strongest scene in the film when they both can no longer bear their world crashing down (could obviously fit in the wards night as a glimpse of a supporting actress nominee). Lee was brave to hold on to this project; the cast was brave to perform the story; we are lucky to have such piece of art to admire two guys heading Brokeback Mountain: The secret place where we wish to return. The place never found but intensively looked for. It is the last illusion, but it is also the last reason to live a complete and honest relationship"".",Brokeback Mountain
1755,rb2000-1,brilliant,10,24 January 2006,"sensitive and sensible portrayal, not just about 'gay cowboys', but something much more. i can't believe 'christian' groups have set the pyres up for this film. they obviously can't see past the surface. heath ledger is, as every critic has pointed out, brilliant, but so is everyone else, particularly in my opinion, michelle williams, as the wife of ledger's character. jake gyllenhaal also delivers one of the most authentic performances i have recently seen in any film. essentially, brokeback mountain is a brilliant film that may just do something to 'humanise' the gay community. if a film could be termed as 'necessary' then this is it. every Oscar that it obviously is going to win, it deserves!",Brokeback Mountain
1756,Steven-Mascaro,A great motion picture experience.,10,19 January 2006,This is the best film that I've seen in years. I do hope it goes on to sweep the Oscars. Every aspect of the film is topnotch. The acting is the best of the year. America has been waiting for this film for some time. Thanks to Ang Lee we have it. The film explores the myth behind the silent cowboy. American mythology has been full of heroes who can't speak. Now we understand that what they want to express is too difficult to put into words. We can thank the great Western writer Larry McMurtry for capturing the tenor of the story. The two leads Jake and Ennis are very much a part of the lonely windswept legacy of Wyoming. I think both writers Tennessee Williams and D. H. Lawrence would understand this story of heartbreaking love. And everyone who wonders about the legacy of the story should read LOVE AND DEATH IN THE American NOVEL by Leavis. But first go see the move.,Brokeback Mountain
1757,edel426,outstanding,10,25 October 2005,"I recently saw the film at the Hawaii international film festival. It has impacted me in a way that I have never experienced before. The acting is beyond compare. For 2 days I cannot shake the sadness that enveloped the characters in this film. I found it inspiring in an unexpected way. It has given me some insight into my own life, the motivation to move forward and not allow inhibitions to rule. In a different time and place,which seems so sad and unfair, their lives would have been so different. Its not a ""gay"" film it is a love story. A love story that transcends gender and illustrates the power of love and the risk we must all take.",Brokeback Mountain

This film didn't do what other homo-films have done in the past and depict us gay men as total nymphomaniac sluts. The ageing of the main characters was not the best but imagination took over anyway, superb acting by all cast. Excellent rough and tumble fight scenes between the gay lovers is exactly what is needed, in my experience it depicts the testosterone fuelled aggressiveness in a man on man relationship.I was expecting more sex, but I'm glad it was left for the imagination most of the time, it would have only hindered the excellent acting.

1761,ozdvdfan,Romance and tragedy in the mountains...,9,5 March 2006,"I live in a small regional town, and there was talk of banning this film in the local cinema. I'm very pleased that this obstacle was overcome and it screened. Even if for a somewhat limited time.I had heard a lot of passing comment and read a few non-spoiler reviews on this film, and really didn't know what to expect. From what I'd read I was fully expecting a fast paced, crass gay-cowboy flick with such overdone and rough sex scenes that it would simply paint a horrid picture of the relationship these two men develop.Happy to say, my misguided thoughts were quickly washed away. This movie is full of beautiful vistas and magic scenery. Thumbs up for cinematography. The sex whilst character-true, is quite tame and certainly doesn't monopolize the screen, there is a great balance between full-on heated romance, and relaxing and enjoying the world.Heath and Jake do a fantastic job of believable 'get-in-and-get-it-done' honest hard working cowboys. They develop the characters bond for each other well. There are a few sneaking glances and smiles that are so cute when you realize these boys are out there in the freezing cold nights, and are trying to uphold the rugged manly image that would be expected of them.Both characters show emotion well, and Heath does well at holding back so much throughout the film.Towards the end you really take in the tragedy underlying the story. They never truly live their own lives, their own lives are always in secret and never shared with friends and family because of what is socially expected of them. The women in their lives suffer directly as a result of societies expectations, because they to are living a false life with no hope for true happiness.Jack always talks about what they could have together if they could just ignore everyone else. Too often their time spent together ends in anger and you are left wishing there was just so much more time for these boys to enjoy life...I hope people watch this movie and learn what social barriers and intolerance can inflict on others. Let people live _thier_ lives, and get on with your own.",Brokeback Mountain
1762,Cheekey_Monkey22,Amazing,10,30 January 2006,"There's something about this film, I saw it a week ago and I still can't get it out of my thoughts. This film reminded me how I felt after seeing ""crash"", a brilliant film, but not one to make you feel good. In some places, not much was left to the imagination and in parts I did feel a little uncomfortable. My best mate and me, being the girlie girls we are even shared a few childish giggles. But this is what made the film, without it, it wouldn't be as strong and create such a deep and powerful meaning to the audience. It is another great love story, but different in so many ways to those we would expect to see. At first it was quite difficult to except two well-known actors (especially after recently watching ""Jarhead"") in completely different and unexpected roles, but soon you look past this and the film is very realistic. You really feel for these characters. Just because it may not be the ""stereotypical"" image of a happy couple, these two are deeply involved and very much in love with one another. Watch this film alone or with your best friend, it's a must see but not one with a group of lads or family members!",Brokeback Mountain
1763,sbayslik,Incredible,10,3 January 2006,"Ang Lee and the entire cast and crew did an incredible incredible job in this work of art. I was numb walking out of that theater, and the film still haunts me days later. You just feel for these two humans and their families. I get choked up when I read a review with some new insight. It starts a little slow, and not being from that region or era seems a bit over-acted. But from the first time that the two main characters part - that is incredible by the way - to the end of the film, I was on the edge of my seat, knowing I was watching one of the most intriguing? love stories on film of all time. I think that with the care of the master Ang Lee, these actors, all of them are all better in their craft as well. It would not at all surprise me should this film receive many honors. Best Director, Cinematography, Best Actor for sure. If it received Best Film, I will be choked up again!",Brokeback Mountain
1764,briansnel,No role models here,2,12 April 2006,"As a gay man I was not impressed with this movie as it portrayed weak characters who could never face their own truths - even when their truths caught up with them. In this day and age of love against all odds these guys were no heroes. They had their ""love"" whilst others they involved themselves with were dragged in. Is this a message we need to see on screens today. OK so they could not be ""out"". I get that. Did they then need to get married. OK maybe, but then lie in those relationships?? Sorry I cannot and will never understand how this movie can be hailed by the gay community as great - it shows gays up as sneaky liars. Through the whole movie I was wrought with angst for the ladies who were the innocent victims - and that cos the guys never could be men.",Brokeback Mountain

What friendship was there? I didn't see the makings of a friendship. I saw two men who had sex... and I believe fell in love. That's great, no issues there at all!! I, however, draw the line when it comes to lying/cheating on your spouse. If you want to love someone, love them. If you want to be a homosexual, be one. Or, understandably, if you've got a fear of the reactions of people because of your sexual orientation, then be alone. Don't make a vow to be faithful, etc and then turn around and do the COMPLETE opposite. This movie wasn't terrible, I just think the STORY was deceptive and crude.",Brokeback Mountain

Would this movie gotten half of the praise if it had have been about a forbidden love affair between a man and a woman? Maybe I was too tired to get into this movie, but the story just didn't interest me. I felt as thought the hook of the movie , a forbidden gay love affair, was a rather unimaginative attempt to sensationalize an otherwise pretty stock standard plot line....What more can I say, the majority of people in my age bracket : Male (18-29) gave it a 7.9, but I just don't see the great performances people are raving about. Heath Ledger, who I DO feel is a great actor (loved Two Hands), irritated me with his mumbling dialog. I mean was he having trouble hiding his Australian accent and therefore chewed every word he spoke? My partner and I constantly were asking each other throughout the movie ""What'd he say?"".Not award material in my view....My 2 c Joe.",Brokeback Mountain

(Head honcho male and male underling in the wings, fairly conservative ..open minded females showing no interest to view the film, in the same audience)Silence at the end of the movie then positive review with excited debate rehashing the experience demonstrates on this occasion a top shelf movie.The movie is a masterpiece of nuances. The director's vision has seen the characters explode onto the screen and reach into our very being.

Forget gender. Forget occupation. Just enjoy it for what it is. An amazing story which is honest. Do not be put off by the length of the film. This is a very deliberate movie. Every scene has a purpose. This allows the viewer to follow the pace of the main characters. As for the sexual aspects, there is only around 1-2 minutes of the movie that deals with this. I found the scenes neither lacking nor drawn out. They simply added to the depth and complexity of the movie. The directing was well done and the backgrounds breathtaking. For me, everything went together (acting, musical score, etc.) and the results were outstanding. I can't quite express the feelings I had while watching Brokeback Mountain. I know that I found myself wishing that I could feel that kind of passion just once in my life. And the pain was hard to watch. Even now, I feel emotionally drained. The angst, yearning, and frustration (as well as a deep profound love) were palpable. I recommend this movie for everyone. Please try and put aside any preconceived notions you might have. Just feel.

What those two went through absolutely kills me inside...so much so that I desperately need to see the movie again to let it all sink in. This movie is, as I have said, heartbreakingly sad, but at the same time, rejuvenating.

We meet two teenage ranch hands out to make some money over a summer by herding a flock of sheep up on Brokeback Mountain. Strangers when they meet, they must work together to tend to a camp and watch the sheep for predators. These two meet for the first time on the day they were hired, but before they come down from Brokeback they have formed a bond that neither one of them had expected. There are no words to explain what they feel, there is no vocabulary and no support system for men in the 1960's who happen to find that once in a lifetime connection - with another man. ""Me neither"" - Jack TwistEnnis is quiet and reserved. Heath Ledger brings this character to life with his first appearance on the screen. It is such a deep character study, so rich with passion and pain. He is a marvel to watch on the screen and it's almost impossible to take your eyes off him when he is in a scene.Jack Twist is rowdy and romantic. Jake Gyllenhaal lights up Jack's eyes with all of the hope and desire needed to transport the audience to that place where love takes hold of you, ready or not! Jack is the risk taker and the dreamer. He has a ranch in his mind where he and Ennis could share their love all the time, and not just in stolen moments. So they painfully part ways after that summer. Never knowing if they will ever see each other again. Each one takes a wife and tries to lead the life society expects them to lead. But how do you forget the deepest love you have ever felt? How do you not let that have an effect on you for the rest of your life? And what do you do when it all comes back to you later in life? You may be different, but true love remains the same.This story is so universal. When posed with choices as difficult as responsibility to your wife and children compared to a life with the one that you love....well there are no easy answers. Experiencing a love that takes your breath away, that makes you want to work and compromise anything and everything to keep it....it is both wonderful and frightening. It can make you question everything you have done in your life to that point and everything you will do in the future.

1771,lesfoudresdivine,Brokeback Mountain,10,7 November 2005,"Every so long comes a movie is able to shake us to the core, leaving us utterly breathless and speechless. This movie is the critically acclaimed Brokeback Mountain. Being dubbed the ""Gay Cowboy Movie"", this film is far from its given nickname. Its about raw emotions and broken souls, which transcends from the screen to our personal lives, whether gay or straight. I screened the movie at the Directors Guild of America, and never once has a movie evoked so much emotion from an audience. Heath Ledger gives a tour de force performance as Ennis Del Mar, whose final scene reminds of why he is one of the most talented and gifted actors of his generation. Jake Gyllenhall's heightened sensitivity provides a delicate balance between the two characters. However, the one actress that completely blew me away was Michelle Williams. Her portrayal as the torn and devastated housewife moved the audience into tears, proving that she is capable of hanging with Hollywood heavyweights. After the screening, besides being drenched in tears, I had the honor of meeting Ang Lee and I told him how much i admired him and his work. Every scene of the movie was sheer beauty, and although it was a bit lengthy, I never wanted it to end. This is truly one of the GREATEST FILMS OF ALL TIME, and I recommend that everyone go watch it whether gay or straight. It provides us an insight on how tough life can get for gay people, when society does not accept them. Its a gem and I truly hope it gets the recognition it deserves.

1774,emmalouwhite,Unbeliveably terrible,2,13 May 2006,"In my opinion, this movie was terrible. Yes, the romantic element was possibly moving, if not slightly nauseating. But the movie as a whole came across as a more controversial driven piece than an entertaining piece of drama. The acting was average, although Jake deserves an honourable mention. I am in no means homophobic, as some of my best friends are homosexual. I simply believe that a movie should be based more on the content than the controversial reviews and comments made afterwards. The relationship between the two men wasn't emotionally driven. To me, it suddenly came out of no where. I witnessed neither build up, nor development in their romantic relationship until suddenly, they going at in the back of a tent. Their relationship was based purely on lust and sex, and the actors on screen chemistry simply destroyed any hope I had of a good movie. I left the cinema feeling empty and unsatisfied. I'd just spent a tenner on that? Overall, I look back on Brokeback Mountain as a disappointing, badly acted, undeserving waste of time.There was so much Ang Lee could have done, but in my eyes he failed, Oscar or no Oscar.",Brokeback Mountain

Now I love Willie Nelson, own a bunch of his music, and think he's a cool guy. However, the song he wrote that plays while the credits roll, in essence tries to summarize the film for me--the audience--and I found it gratuitous. Why not let us decide what we feel and think on our own and don't force a musical narrative on us at the very moment the film ends.

I'll try to do it as best as I can.I saw this film for the first time last Monday (actually is Saturday, five days later). When I went to the cinema I had doubts about the film 'cause ,though Ang Lee's direction meant that couldn't be bad, I don't like very much films with the term ""gay"" on them. And not because I'm homophobic (I'm out of the closet,thanks to God!!!) but because trough some years on the last decade a lot of movies oriented to gay public or with gay characters were released,and almost all of them were simply bad,without any quality or interest and just full of topics. (Sorry again for my English,is hard to explain myself even in Spanish). Maybe the only one I really loved,the most intelligent, brilliant and nice was Todd Hayne's VELVET GOLDMINE (I love it,and is not a ""gay"" film, but a GOOD -more than simply good for me- film with gay main characters,oriented just to intelligent public). And when I saw BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN I fell in love with it. I'm honest if I said that is the best movie I've seen in my life. I'll never have words enough to express what I felt... The story is simply wonderful, Lee's work is perfect,without any bad moment,and Jake and Heath deserve both of 'em an Oscar,they're... Really,I can't find any word to describe their work,they show they're two of the best actors of our time). Finally a good film oriented to every people with brain and sensibility,a story that just talks about love and shows that this isn't a thing that only can happen between a man and a woman (I know this work is having problems with censorship in USA,but here in Europe the only bad critics came from the most reactionary sectors of population). Finally one of the most sensitive,sad and best movies ever created... Sorry,maybe you can think I'm over-reacting but i love it.This is just a classic,one of those movies that time will respect and will be considered as one of the bravest and best creations of Hollywood History. As I said,Lee's work is perfect,tender and intelligent.And Gyllenhaal and Ledger are perfect too(I don't wanna forget to the other people that work on film,all of 'em are absolutely brilliant,but Jake and Heath are the main characters),the tenderness, sadness and love they can create and make feel trough all the story can't be described,so please,if anyone hasn't seen this jewel yet,don't believe my words and go to see it NOW.In a few words,this is A WORK OF ART. Thanks to all the people that made it possible,specially to Ang,Jake and Heath for being so brave against opinions of fanatics and so perfect on their job (they're the best on it,as an important comic character uses to say 'bout himself) BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is and will be one of the most important films of this new century and,for me,the best I've ever seen. The only bad thing on it is the sadness that one feels when it ends. Thanks to Annie too for writing the story -the really good story- that made possible the creation of a wonder like this.Sorry again for my mistakes,I just tried to express what I felt. PS:As I said,today is Saturday, Tonight I'll go to see it again for the 5th time on 6 days (and,honestly,first four times I cried and I know I'll do it again). And I'm praying for its release on DVD (though in USA fanatical censorship is too strong and it scares me to death). Since that day I'll go to cinema for watching it as often I can.I finish here. Just can add that after watching ART like this one must say ""Thanks,God,for making it possible!!!""",Brokeback Mountain
1779,kart-4,heartbreaking,9,12 March 2006,"I'll get the negatives out of the way. So the first hour dragged a bit. Yes, the settings are gorgeous. But I felt Lee let the scenery distract him from the story, as did the choppy editing.That out of the way, oh my god. I left the theatre absolutely devastated. Annie Proulx's short story had the same effect on me when it was published years ago in the New Yorker, then in Close Range. So I approached the movie with trepidation--how many times has a film adaptation of a literary work disappointed? (However, I should have remembered Lee's adaptation of ""Sense and Sensibility,"" one of my favorite films.) Plus, I didn't want to see this film until after the Oscars--I so badly wanted ""Crash"" to win Best Picture.I'm still glad ""Crash"" won. But ""Brokeback"" is also a landmark film. Jake Gyllenhall's performance has been given short shrift. No, it isn't on par with Heath Ledger's--few are--but the characters are totally different, so the portrayals must be. Ennis is completely internal, and Ledger's enactment of that is transcendent, from the closed-off, clamped speech to the hooded, guarded eyes to the way he carries himself. Without giving away any of the plot, that's much of what makes the last few scenes almost unbearable--seeing the ragged pain of this character as he finally faces and realizes what might have been, but now never can be.Is this a gay love story? Yes. Is it a universal love story? Yes. For anyone who has ever had the great love of their life--whether in one of the great cities, in a small town, or in the mountain wilderness--this film will leave you haunted. I will never forget the quietly devastating final scene as the closet door closes.",Brokeback Mountain
1780,cirfi,Forbidden fruit..,10,9 April 2006,"Very intense, very deep. The true moments of a true but hidden love and desire. The tragedy of social expectations and discriminations, secret desires and uncertainty. I love the atmosphere of love all around in the film. Very good acting, Heath-pleasant surprise! Now I love his talent too, not just his good look and sexy voice... :) Jake is good as always. Gender doesn't really matters, you can ""cut"" the feelings in the film, and (luckily) you know these moments and emotions ""step by step"". It still makes me ask the question: Does the forbidden fruit taste better? Anyway, I will have to experience the answer personally... ;) Good job Mr. Lee, thank you!",Brokeback Mountain
1781,pgm76,why,1,22 February 2006,"OK don't get me wrong I'm not homophobic and i know gay people but it irritates me that homosexuality is a trend in Hollywood and not a lifestyle choice. giving homosexuality's popularity in movies I'm not going to be surprised when this slop wins some Oscars. if i truly thought it was a good movie i would give it the due praise. but this movie stunk and will likely bump a picture deserving of an award out because it deals with homosexuality. all the Oscars are about and have been about for quite awhile anyway is ""you scratch my back, ill scratch yours"". after the favors are done and best nominees lose year after year the academies 2nd most important agenda is to maintain political correctness. this point leads me back to the ongoing fashion statement homosexuality has become. so let me be the 1st to congratulate brokeback on their wins but know your movie sucked.",Brokeback Mountain
1782,double_axel,Wonderful,10,29 December 2005,"I highly suggest finding a theatre showing this film and buy a ticket. Ang Lee has done wonders with Annie Proulx's storyline and has carefully created a cinematic masterpiece. Clearly, this is the best movie I have seen this year, hands down. If you're a fan of great Cinematography, this movie will captivate all of your senses. Heath Ledger has an outstanding performance for a character that is arguably the most profound to date in his, albeit short, cinematic career. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance echoes that of Ledger's in depth and quality showing sincerity and pure human emotion.If you like symbolism (ie you're a fan of The Great Gatsby), I definitely recommend seeing this movie as Ang Lee has interwoven much symbolism throughout the film. Symbols of religion, sin, love and death are ever-present and I think this attention to detail in a film has been long overdue.Go see this movie.Grade: A+",Brokeback Mountain
1783,ammoore58,Let yourself believe...,10,5 February 2006,"I, like many others who've witnessed the sheer beauty of this film, cannot seem to shake it. This movie, aside from the brilliant performances and masterful directing, is an all-consuming experience. It haunts in all the right ways, hurts in the way that the loss of great love hurts, and leaves you with a sense of longing that lingers long after you've left the theater. I have only just seen it for the first time two days ago and it will not leave me. I've read the hype, watched the awards shows and visited numerous websites dedicated to this marvel of film. When it opened at my local theater, I was there to experience it for myself.In just over 2 hours, I experienced every emotion possibly connected with this story. Love, hurt, pain, sadness, repression, hope, longing, anger, despair...the list could go on and on. While the characters are not always able to throw away convention, you feel what they do. Particularly Heath Ledger's Ennis as he waits in the living room. Lee's shooting of that particular scene allows the viewer to experience that exquisite torment, the waiting, the nervousness, the despair at thinking he'd never arrive and finally the thrill of being reunited. But it doesn't stop there. Two days later and I can't wait to see it again. This movie sneaks up on you when you least expect it...cooking breakfast, watching TV, washing the dishes, attempting to sleep. It reminds you of those you've loved...whether publicly or in the shadows of a secret.The cinematography itself is amazing. The subtle images Lee allows us to see and the importance with which he presents them demonstrate why he is worthy of the praise. The differences between the styles of his films from ""The Ice Storm"" to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" to ""The Hulk"" show not only his versatility but his willingness to move beyond a comfort zone and make movies for the viewers.The acting is superb. Heath Ledger takes you through his heartbreak, inviting you in to see everything from Ennis's self-loathing to his pure lust to his final promise to Jack. Ledger's portrayal reminds us why we go to the movies. Jake Gyllenhaal's Jack Twist is the man we all want to be. The man who cares not for societal constraints, but who just wants to love. With two scenes, Michelle Williams shows us why we can let ourselves be scared to love who we do and the despair we feel when the person we love doesn't, won't or can't love us back.This is a movie that transcends. It looks not at gender, race, propriety, class, station, wealth, or culture. It simply believes in love and it makes the viewer believe in love. With an open mind, an open heart and the knowledge that this movie will stay with you...go see it. Let yourself remember that love isn't easy, that it hurts and it's painful and it's beautifully torturous, but at the same time allow yourself to believe in love.",Brokeback Mountain
1784,ruffian118,A break-your-heart love story not to be missed,10,9 December 2005,"Had the wonderful opportunity to see this film at the Starz Film Festival in Denver, Colorado at closing night with my son and his partner. The story was solid, drawing on the pain, anger, and frustration felt by these two star-crossed souls caught in a time and place that can still be seen in many areas of this country today. Mr. Gyllenhaal's performance brought tenderness and passion to the character of Jack Twist, his character somewhat more comfortable with his orientation. However, it's the outstanding acting done by Mr. Ledger that lies at the heart and soul of this film. With a character who puts forth very little dialog, his actions, body language, and bottled-up emotion flow through every scene and make you ache for the love he can never fulfill. Lack of either Academy Award or Golden Globe nominations (and wins) would be a true disservice to this young man's lifetime performance. The story was evocative, and the score haunts me every time I hear a clip or see the trailer. I so hope this movie is marketed well -- I've been anxiously awaiting the main news magazines to pick up on this outstanding film.As we all left the theater that evening, I told my two ""sons"", ""what you saw here tonight was history in the making and I'm so glad that I could see it with you."" Thank you, Ang Lee, for the courage, commitment and beautiful delivery of a true universal love story!",Brokeback Mountain
1785,amelia-carrusso,A long-awaited masterpiece...,10,24 February 2006,"Wow. That's pretty much all I can say after having seen this film two times within a fortnight! 'Brokeback Mountain' - starring Jake Gyllenhall as Jack, and Heath Ledger as Ennis Del Mar - openly explores the concept of gay love in the early 1960's. Throughout the film, we follow Jack and Ennis as they try to deal with their families, their separate lives, and their ongoing attraction for each other.When I first saw this film, the thing that grabbed me the most was its individuality. The actors, and the characters they portray are just.. incredible. The storyline is modern and the popularity of the movie proves that homosexuality is becoming more accepted within our society.As a lesbian myself, I attended the movie expecting to see only those who found the ""gay"" life to be of interest to them.. Instead, I saw the elderly, people of different ethnic backgrounds, and many others. In this way, 'Brokeback Mountain' has achieved something that no other gay film that I am aware of has achieved - it has allowed for those of an older generation to see the concept of sexuality from a more modern point-of-view - hence, helping them to understand it better. Yes, the film has had its controversy - but it's achieved, and will continue to achieve some great things.Overall, I give this film a 10/10 for its individual outlook, its openness on a controversial issue, and, from my own personal perspective, the inclusion of Anne Hathaway in the film - she tends to perform the best of them all!",Brokeback Mountain
1786,cabrossette,Amazing,9,17 January 2006,"This is absolutely one of best movies I've ever seen. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal really gave an amazing performance. Ledger's performance of the mush-mouthed Ennis is amazing. He truly becomes the character. Gyllenhaal is equally amazing. His character seems to be more sensitive than Ledger's and Gyllenhaal's amazing portrayal touches your heart. This movie doesn't tell a story, it shows you the story. It draws you in and makes you laugh and cry with the characters. My heart is crying out for an end to the story. I just could not believe that it ended in that way. The honesty of the story is so incredible. I was truly not expecting the character portrayals to be so deep and nuanced. I am going to look for the short story and add it to my extensive book collection.",Brokeback Mountain

I love this movie and I don't think they could have choose a better cast! Ang Lee did a great job directing and the cast did excellent! I've seen it once and can't wait to see it again.

1789,udibi-1,Absolutely heartbreaking,10,12 December 2005,"I read the book before seeing the film. The book was impressive and moving. The movie, on the other hand, left me feeling completely drained and heartbroken. I can honestly say that no other movie has ever even made me cry.Ang Lee draws upon the theme of ""the life tragically unlived"" / ""the life that could have been"" of his films - and does so more powerfully than ever before. The cinematography is stunning, the acting superb, and the editing divine.I think it is very sad that some people will stay away from the film because of the gay/bisexual relationship. I am not gay myself, still I could relate to this film. Who doesn't have something in their life that they wish they had done. Who, if you dig down deep, doesn't have painful ""what if's"" and other regrets. Who hasn't let, what could well have been the perfect love, simply slip away for all the wrong reasons?",Brokeback Mountain
1790,brianwsamuels,The Best Film of '05,10,17 December 2005,"I feel compelled to write this review because this was a film that I hyped up more than any other film this year. I bought the book, watched the trailer at least once a day, bought the score, and read every review that came out. So, how can this film possibly meet my expectations?Because it's a near perfect cinematic experience. Last year we were wowed by Million Dollar Baby, which in 50 years will be considered an American classic, and the same is going to happen with BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. This is a film with so much emotional depth that you can barely even breath. The relationship between Ennis and Jack is the most accurate portrayal of what it is like to be gay in the Midwest. Taking place in Wyoming and Texas, there is no way to get rid of the fear that these two characters could get into a lot of trouble.Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Michelle Williams give some of the best performances ever seen in film and anyone who says otherwise probably hasn't seen enough movies to know what good acting is (and they probably have no idea what bad acting is either). Two other elements, the cinematography and the musical score, are gorgeous as well. These two go hand and hand and they both do a great job at augmenting the emotional impact of the movie. I can't recommend this film more.",Brokeback Mountain

If you want to take a walk with characters that will become unforgettable, superbly acted by Ledger, Williams, and Gyllenthal, this is the movie to see. Don't be afraid to let yourself get lost in one of the most touching love stories I ever had the honor to see.

1792,greggmitch-1,"""Old Brokeback got us good"" - A searing, heartbreaking love story, the BEST of 2005",10,2 December 2005,"I just saw an advance screening of BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN this week - and was literally blown away by the film's force of nature. What to say about the brilliant new film that was a long time coming, could have gone so wrong, but now feels so right? As a fan of Annie Proulx's short story that originally appeared in The New Yorker 1997 and later in her collection CLOSE RANGE, I was amazed how filmmakers involved - the screenwriters, the director, and the brave, talented cast - so expertly distilled - yet somehow expanded - the very essence of her prose to the screen. In that rare instance of an acclaimed work transforming from page to screen, almost nothing was lost in translation, and the final result is nearly perfect. BROKEBACK speaks to me in such a thoroughly personal way that few movies ever do. This film isn't just about the best ""gay"" film ever, it's one of the best films, period, I've ever seen. At turns inspiring, erotic, poignant, and finally heartbreaking, this stunning film is a miracle of economy: not one shot, line of dialogue, or gesture is wasted. The sheer visceral emotional impact working from material so sparse can't be denied. Anyone who is human can't fail to be moved to tears by the film's tragic finale, which must be one of the saddest climaxes ever filmed. While even the supporting roles are expertly cast and finely shaded, the central actors - especially JAKE & HEATH - give raw, nuanced, brave performances that are pitch-perfect. Nothing HEATH has done before quite prepares us for his brooding, inarticulate, internalized performance, while the effortlessly endearing JAKE tackles what could be the more difficult role (Jack's love interest to Ennis' Alpha male) with guts & grace, and MICHELLE WILLIAMS finds subtle notes few knew the actress had. Instead of being limited by gay or straight terms, BROKEBACK transcends all boundaries to become an instant classic, an epic doomed love story for all people, for the ages. It's a searing, shattering masterpiece (there, I said it) that will, hopefully, open minds and hearts, while speaking volumes about ""the love that dare not speak it name"" no matter what the decade. After an ill-advised detour into summer ""tent pole"" action flicks, gifted director ANG LEE returns to what he does best, mounting perceptive, piercingly emotional human dramas on an intimate scale. Here, he walks a difficult tightrope, honestly depicting the roughly physical relationship between Jack and Ennis, never going for the cheap shot, yet never turning away from the truth. While there were a few moments when I wished Lee would have pushed the envelope a bit further to candidly show the sexual reality of Jack & Ennis' decade-spanning affair (the book is much more blunt about matters behind closed doors), it didn't seem quite right for the period, the deeply closeted context of that lost era. Just like Proulx's prose, less is always more. Special kudos for the soundtrack, featuring stellar contributions from Emmylou Harris, Rufus Wainright, Willie Nelson, and more. I will say this: no film in recent memory has affected me quite this way, quite this deeply. After walking out of the theater, I felt a profound melancholy that wouldn't go away. I went home, put on the CD soundtrack, re-read Annie's short story, and again was moved to tears. Days later, the film still haunts me. It won't let go. As Jack put it, ""Old Brokeback got us good.""",Brokeback Mountain
1793,moviebooklover-1,A great movie,9,19 January 2006,"This movie haunts and stays with you because a lot of the heartache could of been avoided. Ennis and Jack are opposites.Ennis has closed of his emotions and always needs to be in control.Jack is more outgoing, a dreamer. I believe that Jack had prior experience with other men but that it was the first time that Ennis had ever been with a man.When Jack made his move on Ennis he probably expected either one of two reactions :for Ennis to punch him or to go along with it.Jack knew that Ennis would never tell anyone else about it whatever happened between them.I think that Ennis got to Jack both fisically and spiritually.They complemented each other.That's why it was so hard for them when the job was over.It isn't everyday that you find your soul mate,that one person that gets who you are and loves you anyway,warts and all. Ennis has always been haunted by the childhood memory of that man's violent death because of his sexual preference.Makes me wonder if he might of given Jack's idea of a ranch a chance if he had never witnessed that.As for Jack death; I do believe he died violently and not in an accident like his wife said.Jack liked men and even though he loved Ennis he needed that physical connection with another man and like he said ""once or twice a year was not enough for him.""I don't believe he would of slept around if he had Ennis fully in his life. Jack was probably discovered in the end with either the neighbor or a male whore and got killed for it.His wife's family covered it up to save their reputation and family name since they came from money.If Jack had not died would he of met Ennis up at brokeback mountain again? I do not know .Maybe. Their relationship being in limbo for 20 years had taken their toll on them.Jack's laughter and dreams had slowly drained out of him during this time.I think he was finally facing the truth that those stolen moments were all Ennis would ever allow for them to have together.As for them never saying ""I love you"" to each other didn't matter.Their actions said it for them. If Ennis had ever said it he would have to admit that he was head over heels in love with Jack ,something he didn't want to admit to himself.As for Jack; He didn't say it because he knew Ennis would not accept it of him and would back away from what they had. Ennis inability to face up to his feelings and take a chance is what makes him such a tragic figure,he cheated himself and Jack out of a life together.!!IT'S NOT THE QUANTITY OF LIFE BUT THE QUALITY OF LIFE THAT MAKES IT WORTH LIVING!! If you loved this movie but would like to see something with a happier ending, try: BIG EDEN,MAURICE, and LATTER DAYS.

1794,ohboy1943,A great Love Story,9,4 February 2006,"I read so much about this film that when I actually saw it, I felt that it missed out so much.I wish to point out that the term ""gay cowboys"" does not apply in this film.It is a human story which we experience in everyday life. In this particular film it would be better to define Ennis and Jack as ""MALE LOVERS."" Their story is all about human love and nothing else. They loved each other, they loved their wives and their children - nothing is gay in their mutual love. The photography is superb, so is the acting and the script. The music is beautiful but very short and played at long intervals. Although the story is so real, however it lacks a few elements. It all sparks off under the tent, but very little is shown how the real love developed between them. Nothing justifies the separation and the urge for one another during their four years of separation. They were too much distracted by their flirting, their marriage and their children. It seems that the urge for one another was all revived by a simple postcard. A few flashbacks could have been included in the film to make up for their long separation. The element of sadness which develops in the second part does not justify the climax. The total disappearance of Jack Twist was not well defined. We have to imagine it through a telephone conversation between Ennis and Jack's wife.The flashback of Jack's death is very quickly wrapped up. I expected that the ending should have been more sad and would have crowned the film with a greater success. How did Jack really die? What version are we to believe? How did it really effect Ennis? The film was brought to an abrupt ending. I left the cinema by saying to myself: a great and tragic love story indeed, which needed a greater ending!",Brokeback Mountain
1795,rjdouthitt,"Finally, a filmmaker has gotten it right.",10,4 December 2005,"I was lucky enough to screen Brokeback Mountain before Thanksgiving and, like many others, the film will not leave my mind. Perhaps it's because I had a similar experience twenty years ago. Everything about the film solidifies that it is a love story, not a gay love story. It is just the most incredible work I've seen in a long time. To say that the film is ""Groundbreaking,"" which is what one reviewer stated, is an understatement. I think this film will change a lot of stereotypes that many narrow minded people have, if they have the open mind to view it. Heath Ledger's voice coach deserves an Oscar. Ang Lee's direction was superb. Larry McMurtry couldn't have stayed truer to Proulx's story. Proulx's standout line: ""If you can't fix it, you just have to stand it,"" is so profound. I woke the next day so emotionally drained, I didn't answer any calls that day. As a film student, that takes a seriously groundbreaking film to do that to me.",Brokeback Mountain
1796,QuantumStrings,"Good Plot and Cinematography, Flow and Development Iffy",7,6 January 2006,"This is definitely one of those movies where you have to evaluate various criteria independently. First, I thought that character development was just plain bad. This plot focused about the relationship between Jack and Ennis, and although there was a significant change in them from the beginning to the end, there was just no way of actually following how this change progressed. And that was just Jack and Ennis; everyone else (chiefly, their wives) had no characterization at all. And I mean, these people are important characters, because it is by deceiving them that Jack and Ennis can be together, so knowing why they behave the way they do, and how their behavior and mentality changes throughout the movie, is crucial. And yet, it didn't happen. I just could not see any change in those characters. Furthermore, the flow of events was just...nonexistent. One thing happened after another, with no flow between them. Many important plot events came as a surprise (though they shouldn't have been), and others just seemed pointless due to the lack of smooth transitions from one to another. It was because of both this lack of continuity and effective characterization that the movie, despite its relatively long length (2:14), seemed way too short. There just wasn't enough time to effectively do and show everything that the movie tried to, and so it feels like pieces are missing. However, there is good news: the cinematography was PHENOMENAL. From the beginning the scenes were just amazingly beautiful and stunning, and you definitely got that one-with-nature feeling from those snow-capped mountains with a red sunrise behind them, or Jack and Ennis on horseback herding snow-white sheep across lush green meadows and cool blue streams. Even when everything shifted to their small towns, the cinematography portrayed the towns in a way that really complemented the plot. I would definitely see this movie again just for the cinematography. And finally, Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger having sex and making out is the hottest thing ever. And they're great actors. So, overall scores:Character Development: 5/10 Flow/Continuity: 4/10 Plot: 8/10Cinematography: 10/10 Acting: 9/10 Total: 7/10It was a good movie, but the really exasperating thing (and it's not unique to this film) is when you have a plot that has the potential to become a really spectacular movie, but because of things like the aforementioned lack of flow and characterization, the movie isn't nearly as good as it could be. Good themes and plot, should be seen by everyone, but maybe wait 'till it's out to rent.",Brokeback Mountain

I'm not normally a country fan, but the score for the film is breathtaking and compliments the locale and the actors ability to give us these characters so honestly. I have become so entranced by this movie I was also compelled to purchase the book, as to have those characters live in my home. That is- until the DVD is released.

Still feel the sorrow inside me. * The first time I saw it, when I was leaving the playing room and just getting into the elevator, I can't control myself but my hand fluttered and was unable to dial my cell phone (I was trying to dial it and wanted to call my friend to detract the emotion I had from seeing the movie). *Then, I irrepressibly burst into tears in the crowded elevator and keep sobbing on the way home. How could a movie that is considered with very flat tempo, very plain and simple plot make such impact on me? I am still trying to figure out why.... ---------- Love is a force of nature.And may the force be with us!(I am sorry for bad English typing, I think everyone here can understand what I mean)",Brokeback Mountain
1800,pet101,Slowly paced but it works,8,30 March 2006,"I thought this film was amazing. Brokeback Mountain is a great story with all the ingredients for an epic film. Even the soundtrack is good. The directing was amazing as was the scenery. Top notch acting from a seemingly talentless cast besides Jake who has always been great. Great improvements on Michelle Williams and Heath Ledger who I had previously casted off as teen comedy stars. The screenplay was great, Rodrigo Prieto's photography captures the magnificent Wyoming settings. Slowly paced but it works.Watch the movie. But if you have a chance to read the book, do. It will explain some of the scenes in the film that otherwise don't make sense.",Brokeback Mountain
1801,lightwizard-1,"""Brokeback Mountain"" Is A Cinematic Masterpiece",10,7 February 2006,"I've read nearly every professional review and the user reviews on the Website. All I have to add is this film proves Ang Lee has done his homework. Although the style is his own, he's telling this story with minimal dialog (albeit expertly written dialog that will be quoted for years) and proves a picture is worth a thousand words. I see influences of Kubrick, especially ""2001"" and ""Barry Lyndon,"" and the minimalism of ""L'Aventura"" shining through. The composition of the scenes are a striking echo of ""L'Aventura"" and it is also a story of love thrown to the wayside, but in that film it's the dalliances of the idle rich that is the tragedy. The almost metaphysical, symbolic imagery is astonishing. It's just going to go over many moviegoer's heads and this has manifested itself in one way by concocting jokes -- jokes that provoke nervous, self-conscious laughter in many cases.This is a unique film experience and not just because there are gay thematic ideas contained therein. It will hold up in film history and could become a watershed film, actually unlike any of the racism or anti-Semitism films of the past because the results could easily reveal themselves quite soon.",Brokeback Mountain
1802,energetic_yang,simple truth: Brokeback Mountain is all time best!!!,10,6 February 2006,"Don't want to go in too detailed 'cause I believe most comments here expressed my opinion. I can search all my beautiful and powerful words describing this movie, but I want to just show my deepest thanks to all the cast and film makers involved in this legendary picture, Ang Lee, Heath Ledger, Jake, Michelle Williams, Anne and all the supporting actors. It is the unusual courage leading you to provide us such a thorough hearting wrenching and forever haunting picture and a perfect journey in analyzing everything hidden inside everyone.I will always remember early in 2006 I saw such a wonderful movie with so much depth. I will also be my forever pity if it didn't win Oscar best picture. I always have faith in Oscar and hope this time Oscar doesn't let me down.",Brokeback Mountain
1803,sbpitcher6446,"""the story of two gay cowboys""",10,7 December 2005,"I must say, that i am probably one of the youngest to see this movie.(17) My first thoughts were, a movie about gay people? The i kept seeing it on previews to movies,and i got a little more interested. I decided to look it up online. i saw the trailer, and was thriving to know more. i started to read other peoples comments on the movie. Making me want to see the movie even more. Reading the comments about the scenery and the actors and the love story made my eyes water. I knew i had to see this movie. I went and saw it. The story line of the love story had me wanting to know why.... why would want to hide such passion. one might say ""forbidden love""... the scenes where intense. I would have to say, they could have gone a bit father with them. The acting was what had me at the end saying, its over? I sat in the theater as the credits rolled reviewing the scenes in my mind. Almost not excepting the end. I was the last one out of the theater. I most have stayed there for an extra 20 minutes. As i drove home, i couldn't stop thinking about the movie. It seemed like I was watching a movie about someones true life. It changed my opinion about gay people. It is not wrong to love a man if you are a man or a women if you are a women.You are both human beings.doesn't matter if you are the same sex.its not like your marrying your animal or something.There is nothing wrong with your humans loving each other.we view it as wrong if we see people of the same sex kissing. its because we were taught that way. unfortunately. Its not like gay people are monsters. they are just two people in love. I would change almost nothing. some words were hard to understand. Mostly because of the accents. After the movie I thought that wasn't a gay movie, that it was a love story. I recommend it to all ages. 17 and up of course , due to some sexual scenes.so basically its just about 2 guys who are broke and lookin for any job they can get. they meet each other in wymoning, at a sheep herding job.( they don't know there gay yet). so they become good friends, through the job and drink together and tell old stories. then one night ennis gets drunk and in the middle of the night comes into jacks tent and end up having sex,. ennis is resistant at first. almost scared. refusing to belief he just did that or that he is gay. he says to jack the next day ""i ain't no queer"" ""that was just a one time thing"". but as the job goes on ennis can't help it but, he continues to like jack sexually and they continue to have a ""gay"" relationship. then they have to split up at the end of the summer and they go there separate ways. and they get married to women and have kids. then one day ennis gets a postcard from jack, saying he'd like to see him. so jack comes to ennis's house and they instantly kiss, and through the next 20 years they keep meeting up and going away for a week or more. and there's things that happen through these 20 years, complications. heartbreaks. and then the ending. now i am not going to say the ending cuz i don't' want to ruin it. but all i am saying that it is heartbreaking. so its not the comedy of the year or the best feel good movie of the year either. so if you don't want a sad heartbreaking movie don't see this. but i insist that you see this movie. it is a great love story.!",Brokeback Mountain
1804,ramonaagin,Heart Wrenching,10,16 May 2006,"Absolutely on of the best films of 2005, should have done better at the Academy Awards than it did. Whether you are homosexual or heterosexual if you have ever been in love you cannot help but be touched to the soul by this movie. I strongly recommend that everyone watch it with and open mind and heart, it will sear you to the bone. Not only is it a beautifully written and directed script the actors deserve a huge round of applause for their talented performances. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking as is the music score. It is the best movie I have seen in years, I saw it in the theater twice and have watched the DVD three times since then. It is sad that in this day when we should be free of bigotry and hatred to realize that there is still so much out there that two human beings were forced to live apart hide their love for one another for fear they would not be accepted.",Brokeback Mountain
1805,Shore-Steven,One outstanding and honest film!,10,27 December 2005,"There is far more to this movie than Jake Gyllenhaal's blue eyes. The movie struck me as an excellent fusion of A Separate Peace and The Diary of Anne Frank, with, unsurprisingly, the sparse landscape and dialog of The Last Picture Show. As someone of the same generation as Jack and Ennis (although I have spent less than one hour of my life in Wyoming), the environment (both of the external landscape and the interior landscape of the characters) struck me as authentic, with never a false moment in the movie. Although some of the dialog might have been clearer with subtitles, I never had the sense of watching a film, but felt that what was before my eyes was actually unfolding. Also, the film wasn't one second longer than it needed to be, even though it expands upon a sparse short story (55 pages), serving essentially as a faithful and reverent visual meditation on it. Intellectually, without preaching or posturing to its audience, the movie subtly gets the point across of the psychological and social consequences of a world in which human beings cannot be their authentic and honest selves, and that this world would be a better and more moral place if men like Jack and Ennis could honestly and openly express the love they feel for each other without fear of ridicule, reprisal, and violence. Politically, I hope every viewer will be inspired to work for the legalization of same-sex marriages throughout the United States, and that my fellow Christians (I am a regular churchgoer myself) will work to extend the sacrament of Holy Matrimony to gay and lesbian couples in their respective denominations. I will definitely see this film at least a second time.",Brokeback Mountain
1806,l-adriana,"Heartbreaking, beautiful, vital",10,9 March 2006,"The movie or, better said, the ""piece of art"" is able to overcome any stereotype regarding the relationship between two people of the same sex. The construction of the love story through time and life relates to any human being and the way we are born as. It's a heartbreaking moving love story about discovery, passion, denial, rejection, love, hate and loneliness. And most of all, it's a story about dealing with the external barriers others impose and how they affect the way our lives will be. Ultimately, the movie deals with the most deep feelings a human being is capable of, the wonderful sensation of being loved and the staggering feeling of absence of our loved one. A work of art that cannot be missed and has to be appreciated in all its beauty.",Brokeback Mountain
1807,gritte2,Do not waste your time.,1,8 February 2006,"From an audience point of view, this movie was not enjoyable. The main actor's words were difficult to understand and I spent more time trying to decipher his drawl then enjoying the film. The story moved very slow and is similar to most Greek tragedies. Just because the story's content was controversial for its' time, does not mean this movie was good by any means. Do not believe the hype, this movie was not well done and should not win any Golden Globes of Oscars. The only reason for someone to see this film is if they are interested how someone deals with life as a homosexual and a sheep herder. Ang Lee is capable of much better.",Brokeback Mountain
1808,Clunie7,Best movie ever! I can't get it out of my head!!!,10,26 March 2006,"I saw this movie twice at the theater. WOW!! It got to me. The cinematography was awe-inspiring. So beautiful. Heath, Jake, Michelle and Anne were wonderful. I can't imagine anyone else in those roles. What got to me, however, was the plot. Such a bittersweet story. Even though i would have love for Ennis and Jack to have a happy ending, the way it ended in the movie was the right way to go. If it had ended any other way, it wouldn't have impacted so many people the way it has. That's what makes it so bittersweet. I think Ennis finally realizes what a wasted life he has had when Jack is gone. It hits him, he will never see Jack again; they could have had a beautiful life together, but now it's too late. I get chills, just thinking about the last scene. I recommend people read the short story by Annie Proulx. The score is haunting. I bought the soundtrack and can't stop listening to it. I'm lucky enough to work in the video industry and was able to get a screener copy. I'm afraid I'm going to wear it out! I watch it more than 2 times a day every day! LOL! My friends are getting a little worried about me, LOL! I admit it, I'm can't quit you, Ennis and Jack!",Brokeback Mountain

1810,louielsh,Heartache on Brokeback Mountain,10,10 December 2005,"I have just returned from seeing this tremendous film, and that includes every aspect of it, from the screenplay to the directing, cinematography, and last but not least of all the incredible acting talent that brought this story to life. People always want to pigeonhole movies with a short catchy phrase. This one has been labeled that ""gay cowboy movie"", which is an inept description for such a complex film. What makes this movie so compelling is that the characters, Ennis and Jack, as written and portrayed, are flawed human beings struggling to cope with a situation that at the time, 1963, was still extraordinary, at least in terms of visibility. This is a story about two men who lived in a culture aggressively hostile to same sex attraction, sex and love. (Apparently as strong as ever in 2005 based on some of the comments about this movie posted on this website.) But against the odds, they are attracted to each other, have sex, fall in love and struggle with the consequences for 20 years. These are two men who don't make the best choices and decisions; they hurt other people who also love and care for them, and they hurt each other emotionally and physically, and it is all caused by that complicated human condition described as ""being in love"". In other words, this is a dramatic movie with realistic, complex characters, not simplistic stereotypes. Even though Jake Gyllenhall and Michelle Williams are also excellent, this is Heath Ledger's and ultimately Ennis' movie. What a masterful performance. Very seldom are men in American movies shown as such complex human beings as they are in this movie, exhibiting a full range of conflicted emotions and feelings including fright, sexual longing, hopeless love, happiness, rage, jealousy, disappointment and sadness, and all of these are portrayed to extraordinary effect in Ledger's voice, body and face. A lot of comments have been made in reviews about the sex scene(s). There really is only one, it is not graphic, and personally I found it pretty tame. If you are thinking about avoiding this movie because you might be challenged on some level by seeing two men having sex, try to get past that and go see one of the best movies of this or any other year.",Brokeback Mountain
1811,OrlandoIslands,Amazing and touching love story...,10,22 January 2006,"I finally had the time to see Brokeback Mountain this weekend. It was everything I would have hoped for. In my personal opinion this is the best love story in a long time. It's fresh and different, moving and emotional. Jake Gyllenhaal (Jack Twist) gives an amazing performance. His acting skills brightly shine and allow you to realize and understand his love for Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger). Heath Ledger moves audiences with his portrayal of a frustrated, confused, lovesick man.I will warn you, this movie does have intense sexual scenes between two men. Do not see this movie if you are uncomfortable with that. I feel that if you can't accept the beauty of the love between the two men, you can't appreciate the movie, as you should. There is a good amount of nudity as well.That said, I encourage you to see this movie. It is destined to be a classic in cinema history.P.S.

Besides the powerful story, great acting and cinematography I think it's a test of the state of the viewer's heart and soul. Most negative (as well as vicious) reviews have come from people who have not seen the film - makes you wonder about the darkness in their lives.By faithfully following the short story Ang Lee forces the viewer to ""do the work"" in their own hearts and minds.Thus it is a litmus test as to the state of one's soul.This is what great literature is meant to do and what cinema has generally lost, which may be responsible for the decrease in the box office receipts over the last few years.People are yearning to have their souls touched and this film certainly accomplishes that!",Brokeback Mountain

The sex scenes were tastefully done. Actually they did not really need to be in the film The passion and love is what really carries the film. It reminded my of my childhood feelings of love lost.

I mean, gay cowboys???This is not a gay cowboy movie though--it's one of the all-time best romance movies ever. I should say tragic romance stories. There is this sense of impossibility to Jack and Ennis' relationship that gives you a knot in your stomach--they both understand that their relationship is a once-in-a-lifetime love, and yet they can't be together...so sad, and so powerful that I can't get the movie out of my head even two days after having seen it. You need to see this movie. I promise, even if you are much more conservative than I am, it will change how you think about gay people...",Brokeback Mountain
1815,sbjd29,Powerful beyond belief,10,20 January 2006,"I had read most of the comments here before going to see this, so considered myself pretty well-informed as to what I could expect. But my-oh-my, nothing could have prepared me for the raw, palpable, gut-wrenching sense of reality one only experiences in a movie theatre once in a lifetime. What a great story, and what a truly truly masterful rendition of it on the big screen. The acting was for me simply second to none - especially the two main characters. I felt every emotion they did, and the whole experience left me in tears (for all the right reasons). I have never left a movie theatre with streaming eyes before, and what's weird about it is I didn't even care, didn't try to hide from it or didn't give twopence if anyone saw me in my helpless state. That's the type of movie this is. Forget the theme for a minute, and just go experience this wonderful, brilliant, stunning, powerful masterpiece. Because that's what it is - a totally moving experience. And one you're not likely to forget in a hurry. For me, it was the most memorable film I've seen in my life thus far, and is likely to remain so for a very very long time. I truly hope it receives the recognition it deserves. Kudos to everyone involved in its production.",Brokeback Mountain

Unexpectedly, I was disappointed how low-keyed and almost flat this film appeared. Yet, a few days later while puzzled by this film, I was also haunted, like so many of the commentors here, by some of the images and dialog of the loneliness and sadness as well as how real these characters were in the film.This is country music, we hear on the radio, in celloid. This is no way a gay story, rather a story of two people with everyday life struggles, circumstances as well as personal struggles that get in the way being together.A good film,yes.

And the things they had to endure over twenty years to get to see one another shows that love is very powerful. Cudos to all involved in this movie, from the Actors to all in it. And to Annie Proulx who wrote such a great short story, I highly recommend anyone to see this movie if you like Love story's. Remember to take Kleenex it gets very sad also. And I also feel that this film is not a ""Gay cowboy Movie"". Its a film about two people who are in love and can not express it,because of the times they lived in. They are very repressed, and it is sad as to what measures they had to go to, to see one another. None the less its a powerful love story that will stand the test of time.",Brokeback Mountain

Hope it does well at the box office. It will be very interesting to see just how well members of the straight community like and accept this movie. Making Love which was done some twenty odd years back bombed because at the time Mr.&Mrs. America just weren't ready too accept that a married man would actually leave his wife for a man. Also using an actor and an actress who were well known for role model TV characters, America just couldn't accept them in another situation.

There have been only a few times when a movie was able to capture my heart and take hold of it. Jake's ability to portray the emotions of Jack Twist was just awesome. I couldn't believe this man made me forget he was playing a character. However, Heaths performance was top notch and blew all my favorite actors out of the water. His performance in this movie was incredible!! These men were able to tell one of the best love stories I have ever heard of. Kudos to everyone who had a hand in this movie.

I hope it serves as an eye-opener to all conservative people that being gay is not a sin or wrong, it is just a matter of who you love. Being gay doesn't mean you are a woman, just that you are in love with a man. And besides, why would God be concerned with our sexual preferences if we still love Him with our entire life?

1822,persnikitee,Hauntingly Beautiful,10,14 January 2006,"What an achingly beautiful film. The controversy of it being 'the gay movie"" was so unwarranted; instead it was a movie that with its gorgeous views and the scarcity of words allowed you to see inside the hearts of two exceptional characters. I was immediately taken with the reserved nature of Ennis and the much more outgoing, Jack. Both actors were wonderful, each conveying such a sense of vulnerability. Even with the subject content of two men in love, it effectively portrayed that love, the type of love that is encompassing and not always sexual. Ang Lee created a movie that asks each of us to think with our hearts, to look at these two characters and feel with them. He ably brought in the supporting characters to further define the film.I would highly recommend this film-- upon the closing credits leaves one with a sense of bittersweet regretwhether it is your own memories of love, or in my case, my own ignorance that true love really, as is the case of Jack and Ennis, knows no boundaries.",Brokeback Mountain

Still this morning my heart is filled with the emotion this movie evokes. It's rare to see quality like this. The acting is impeccable. Heath deserves every award nomination he's received. The performance is nothing short of incredible and I was astonished of his skill. Of course Ang Lee has shot and directed a beautiful picture. The writing is superb. The subtlety of the extraordinary delivery was exemplified when a few word line could speak so much. You will feel the intensity of emotion of these men and their wives too.

1824,txeventine,Beautiful on many levels,9,22 December 2005,"Some of my friends loved it, some merely liked it. It's been hyped a lot and certain people can be forgiven for not feeling it lived up to the hype. This movie was so good on several levels. Others have commented on the acting, but I'd like to focus on everything else other than the acting (which was good). First of all, this is a hauntingly beautiful movie. The cinematography was amazing - beautiful mountains, streams, horses, and so on. It was visually stunning to look at (excepting the makeup problem James mentioned). This was bolstered by an amazing soundtrack, including originally scored music with a Western style that perfectly complemented the theme and look of the movie. After the credits began to roll, Willie Nelson's voice began crooning ""He Was a Friend of Mine,"" a beautiful song that ends the movie perfectly. A better song could not have been selected for that spot. The story is also beautiful. It was adapted from an award-winning short story by Annie Proulx, who I had never heard of before the movie, and turned into a screenplay by Larry McMurtry, widely known and respected (especially by manly-men) for writing ""Lonesome Dove"" and many Western novels. The story is quite deep, illustrating how sometimes love can be painful and true feelings can be difficult to put into words (for some, like Ennis Del Mar). This movie satisfied me. One reason is that it has the potential to reach and touch a wide audience - hopefully, a straight audience who hasn't been exposed to gay themes before, other than in Will & Grace and ""Queer Eye"". It was, in my view, the first gay-themed movie I have seen that didn't have such a low budget that it looked like it was filmed on a ten year old Sony Handycam, where the acting wasn't hammy, overdone and/or half-done, and didn't focus on first loves or just sex. ""The Broken Hearts Club"" comes close, but ""Brokeback Mountain"" is a better film. ""Brokeback"" presents to mainstream America two gay men who aren't feminine, who aren't obsessed with sex and drugs, and who simply want to live their lives together. The concept is simple, and the movie presents that simple concept while illustrating how complicated that often is for gay men. It illustrates also how easy it is for gay men to slip into the role of a heterosexual; getting married and having children, yet still finding themselves unfulfilled and knowing they aren't being true to themselves. For me, this is something that the religious right needs to see in order to help them understand that silly issue of ""choice.""",Brokeback Mountain
1825,fortyinmelb,A force of nature that will not be denied,10,10 January 2006,"I first heard of the motion picture through a friend of mine several months ago. She wanted me to know about this new movie coming out as a mainstream movie directed by Ang Lee and with Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal playing the roles of closeted gay cowboys set in the wilds of Montana. My first thought was for these two very talented and good looking guys, have they damaged their careers? I've enjoyed watching them in the many roles they have preformed and it pained me to think that they had made, although a courageous decision, a damaging one. At the age of forty six and having ""come out "" at twenty nine I've seen and heard of many a horror story, as stories of acceptance. In the current climate of our society and with all the strides that have been made via television i.e. Will & Grace, Queer as Folk and Queer Eye the overriding fact is that for most of the country not much has changed, less we forget Matthew Shepard and the many that have gone unnoticed.Since I was told about the movie I've avidly followed the progress and reaction for this film via internet and media. I must say that for the most part I have been flabbergasted by the almost euphoric reaction across the board both for the story and gratefully the people involved. Being a history buff I'm well aware that history has its turning points at which change is affected. For the gay community and our struggle for acceptance, and for all minorities, this film will come to represent a catalyst on that road to inclusion. Love has no parameters, no color, no ethnicity, no religion; it is truly ""a force of nature"". The movie opened in Orlando on the sixth of January at the ENZIAN THEATER and will be showing until the 12th of January, it has been sold out for almost all of the showings. I along with many of my friends and family attended the movie and fervently support those involved in the making of the film for having the humanity, heart and courage to make it.I've also been reading the many stories left on the Brokeback Mountain website by so many from around the world and what struck me about them is the common vein that runs through them. We've all had similar situations to varying degrees with so much heartbreak, pain, disappointment and unfulfilled lives, and if you wanted a definition of a crime I could not think of any better. Those in our society that for what ever reason are frightened to the core of their souls by the idea of two guys whom happen to love each other and who unfortunately use religious dogma and faith in a higher being to veil the hateful bigoted narrowed viewed rhetoric to make themselves feel superior, one would hope that they would finally realize that this is ""A FORCE OF NATURE"" that will NOT BE DENIED! I would like to thank all of the cast and crew for having the talent to bring to life a world that has for too long languished in the shadows. Also a special thank you to Ang Lee, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal, I know that you are just doing your craft and passion in life but, know, that it has profoundly touched and changed lives now and for the future. In addition I would like to wish Heath and Michelle congratulations on the birth of their daughter Matilda Rose on the 28th of October. God bless you all and may your lives be filled with all that is good in life but, most of all be filled with LOVE!",Brokeback Mountain
1826,christianalbrechtsen,Truth,10,14 December 2005,"This movie reminded me in many ways of Lars Von Trier's ""Dancer in the Dark"", a musical about a woman (played by Björk) who does anything possible to save the future of her young son. She ends up loosing her own life over this, and the execution scene is one of the most haunting scenes i've ever seen on screen. But having seen Ennis swearing to be truthful forever to the love of his life, Jack, but without being able to articulate this in so many words because of fear, and because he probably doesn't even understand the feelings he has, i have to say, i surrendered completely.This film is the perfect example of how important it is for the director as well as the actors to maintain a truthfulness towards the characters, they are portraying.The story is pure and nothing is overstated. And where Lars Von Trier deliberately wanted to seduce his audience, Lee wants only to share this story with us. He does not at any time force us into feeling a particular way or feel, that he must explain his characters to us. He simply let's them tell their own story in their own way. This is of course also based on a very precise script. The scenes do not tell us, where the characters are going, it simply unravels each their inevitable destinies as they happen.I have seldomly been this moved by a film, as i was by Brokeback Mountain. As others have stated before me, this is not just a provocative ""gay-movie"", but a haunting but also in many ways reassuring portrait of love.I will care these people with me for a long time to come.",Brokeback Mountain
1827,sfgrl,Like a ton of bricks,10,14 December 2005,"I saw Brokeback Mountain for the first of what I hope to be many, many times two days ago, and I don't think a minute has passed since the viewing when the film's brilliance hasn't permeated my thoughts. I find myself scouring the Internet, hoping to find anything that will remind of me of this monumental film.Reading the user comments, I am struck by how many people feel exactly as I feel  like you have been hit like a ton of bricks and unable to stop thinking about it. I had read the short story several times before seeing the movie and thought knowing the story and its sad ending in advance would brace me for the film version. It did not. Instead, I think I was crying ten times as much because I could not bear for Jack and Ennis to meet their terrible fate.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall are magnificent and if not for them (and the incredible work by Ang Lee), I think this film would have been a massive disappointment. Instead, days later, just thinking of Ennis and Jack's stolen embrace and kiss in broad daylight after being apart for four years is enough to make my heart skip a beat and my stomach lurch. Everything about that scene is perfect  Ennis' giddiness as he waits for Jack, how he skips down the stairs, the genuine embrace that quickly gives way to a clinch and kiss that seems to overpower both of them, their efforts to pull one another away from each other and Ennis' reluctance to do so as evidenced by his subtle but oh so honest hand gestures as he turns away from Jack so they can meet Ennis' wife. I've teared up just sitting here at my desk at work.Heath Ledger's performance is the most amazing thing I've seen in years. I really just wanted to get onto the screen and hug him. Which reminds me of the effectiveness of the Cassie Cartwright character (which I don't believe was in the short story). Here is this man, Ennis Del Mar, who barely says a word and appears mostly downtrodden and at a dead end in his life. And yet, because of the depth and emotion that Heath Ledger is able to infuse into Ennis, this bubbly, outgoing and beautiful woman is completely in love with him. The magic, of course, is that this doesn't seem implausible. I loved Ennis, too. Judging from the audience, we all did. And his inability to reciprocate that love with anybody but the one person he perceives as forbidden is what renders this story among the most heartbreaking I've ever known.I don't normally write reviews either, as many others have mentioned, but feel obligated to out of the deep sense of gratitude I have for Ang Lee, Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhall, Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway and, of course, the genius of the original short story and wonderfully adapted screenplay. This film is an instant classic that will be mentioned in the same sentence as all the great ones. Thank you for the bravery and skill that was exerted for our benefit.P.S. I am already preparing myself for disappointment come Oscar time, but sincerely hope that BBM sweeps all categories. No other movie came close this year.",Brokeback Mountain
1828,lojewski,I thought the movie was slow and didn't hit it's stride...,5,14 December 2005,"I don't know what movie everyone else is seeing, but the movie I saw was very slowly-paced and my partner and I kept waiting for the movie to hit it's stride...Now, don't get me wrong, we totally understand why, initially, the story had to be stretched out...We had to see that this relationship developed over time and that the two didn't just go up the mountain and start being intimate with each other...But, then, the rest of the movie seemed to pace just as slowly...The direction/production were beautiful...Wow! The scenery was amazing, but the storyline just didn't seem to flow...I've never read the short story, but was there anything omitted in the film from the story that might have made it a little different? I had been waiting to see this movie for almost a year...Two major stars in a nationally released gay themed major motion picture??? I'm totally on board! But, after waiting that year, and then going to LA to see it a week ahead of everyone else, I felt disappointed...I wasn't looking for a lot of 'I love you's' or a lot of graphic sex because I know middle America wouldn't go for that, but I was looking for a movie that would hopefully, finally change some people's views of things...I still hope this movie does that, but we never saw genuine love or grief, we only saw lust and wanting...We, along with the rest of the audience, should have left that theater in tears...That's what would move middle America...I see it's getting a lot of awards, so maybe that helps...Lastly, (if you haven't seen the movie do not read this part) I don't understand why if Ennis doubled over in pain and hurt when Jake left him the first time did he not have a stronger reaction to Jake's death? We kept waiting for the heartfelt hurt and agony that would come from the loss of someone you had spent 20+ years with, but it never came...Especially, since Ennis wasn't there when Jake passed...That would make it even worse...Again, was that in the short story? How can someone not react to that? I'm proud of the film, it's directors and it's actors...I'm just not too keen on the pace of the story...Hopefully, the DVD will offer some deleted scenes or alternate endings...The current ending had us leaving the theater saying, 'um, what...........'",Brokeback Mountain
1829,Dmlb22,A true love story for the ages......,10,6 January 2006,"A Fantastic movie, the best I've seen in years.A love story for the ages...I've never been so emotionaly touched by a movie.I found myself on a roller coaster of emotions,I was feeling the love, pain , anguish, heartbreak,needing, and wanting the one thing you can't have. Everything Ennis and Jack were feeling I was feeling too. Seeing this movie once definitely is'nt enough. I went to the movies expecting, and hoping to see the best movie I've ever seen, and I did. All the actors did a tremendous job, the cinematography was fantastic.Everything about this movie was well thought out, from picking the location to choosing the right actors.The title of the movie says it all ""Love is a force of nature"". You don't control Love , it controls you......",Brokeback Mountain
1830,gideonchap,amazingly beautiful and tragic,10,15 December 2005,"This is a masterpiece for any genre of movie. It has a wealth of emotion conceived from the slightest amount of dialog. Not much is often said, but it is still all there. The actors and the scenery relate the story in simple and moving gestures. Heath Ledger and Michele Williams are especially powerful. The idea of gay cowboys may seem laughable to some, but under Ang Lee and the writers's care the movie becomes a ground breaking piece of story telling. It's a movie that can easily appeal to all audiences, but at the same time shows how far the gay community has come, and how far it still has to go for acceptance, without the movie being heavy or over political. Ang Lee has created a movie at it's heart is a beautiful and tragic American love story.",Brokeback Mountain
1831,dms00015,One summer years ago...,9,15 December 2005,"Well, I saw the film last night. I've been looking forward to watching it since I heard about it months ago. I thought that it was a beautiful movie for many different reasons. First, it takes guts to play the roles of Ennis and Jack, considering the players are two prominent straight Hollywood actors. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway were great too.The reason why I enjoyed the film was because it isn't every day that a film portrays this kind of love between two men, and it is particularly special because their connection lasts for such a long time and it doesn't fade. It is bittersweet. It touches the heart because people can relate to it no matter the sexual orientation. All in all, this is definitely the first of its kind in that it is a major motion picture.",Brokeback Mountain
1832,mfranklin-7,Excellent,10,3 January 2006,"Just drove two hours to see this film yesterday and I can't get it out of my mind. It was awesome. The most compelling and beautiful love story ever.... Health Ledger was fantastic as the taciturn Ennis Del Mar. He and Jake Gallenthall were beautiful together. Once thing I cannot figure out is does anyone think Jake's ""wife"" knew what really happened to Jake, and she was just dishing out a cover story... The entire theater was in total tears as we walked out. I would recommend this to all. I must submit ten full lines of text, so I guess I will continue. Probably the most shocking scene in the film for me, was when Alma saw them kissing downstairs by the laundromat. The actually sex scenes were not disturbing at all. Mike",Brokeback Mountain
1833,bylundsfo,A Masterpiece,10,16 December 2005,"I saw this excellent, stirring, and haunting film on opening day last week and had to return to see it again yesterday. I haven't been able to get it out of my mind. It's beautiful and it's profoundly sad. The moments of emotion are so intense as the build-up in between is long and fraught with difficulty. Heath Ledger is gaining well deserved claim (if he doesn't garner the Oscar then he's just been cheated -- sorry Philip Seymour Hoffman) but also Jake Gyllenhaal brings a sparkling performance. The chemistry between those two is simply awesome to observe. It is now my mission to get everyone I know into that theater to see this masterpiece. Those who characterize this film as a ""gay cowboy"" movie are just missing the point entirely; it is a time honored love story of Shakespearean proportions.",Brokeback Mountain
1834,christopher_orne,I could not believe it!,10,16 December 2005,"I saw this movie three days ago, and I still cannot get the story out of my head. It swings your emotions all over the place, and doesn't stop after 130 of the best minutes you'll ever spend in a crowded room of strangers. It is up there with the greatest love stories ever told. After seeing it one can only ask, where has this movie been all my life? I can tell you...it was waiting for two of the most courageous, talented, inspired, and exceptional actors to team up with the simply amazing director who can bring us some of the most beautiful scenery and drama to our eyes. And no one is a loser in this (audience or otherwise)! This is THE movie for everyone in the world to see.

1835,darusso1,A wonderful view of love and life,10,16 December 2005,"It is so rare that I would even take the time to write a review of a movie. In fact, this is my first ever. Still, I feel compelled to tell whomever will read that this movie utterly moved the core of my soul. No where else have the struggles that gay people go through to come to terms with their sexuality been captured as poignantly, accurately and successfully as in this movie. It also captures the impact and affects of living life in fear (this can really apply to anything, not just being gay) and how many lives you touch and change as a result of being overwhelmed and terrorized by that fear. Both Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger did this movie justice with their talent and depth, and they both were nothing short of stellar in capturing the complexities of these roles. WOW!!! (Anne Hathaway & Michelle Williams were equally wonderful as well!) Also, Jake & Heath magnificently portrayed the beautiful love story that is at the core of this movie. RUN, do not walk, to the theatre and see this movie. It is for one and all - in all walks of life. If you open your heart and your mind, you will be enriched more than you'd have ever thought possible.",Brokeback Mountain
1836,newyearsbaby1471,Heartbreaking,10,21 January 2006,I saw the movie for the third time in three weeks and I still can't get enough of it. The acting is just excellent from everyone in the cast. I would never have guessed how heartfelt this movie was. The scenery is lovely and the soundtrack's great. I am not a fan of country music but EmmyLou Harris' song is beautiful. I just wait to see the Academy Awards. I know it will get the Oscar for Best Picture and Director. It is a powerful and haunting movie. The ending just blew me away. Did anyone else feel this way? At first I wasn't sure if Heath Ledger and Jake Gylenhaal would do it justice. I really would like gay movies to use gay actors. Just one half hour into the movie I knew that Ang Lee made the right choices. It really isn't a gay movie but a love story.,Brokeback Mountain
1837,lm5462,One of the best of the year,10,16 December 2005,"Prior to this movie I thought Philip Seymour Hoffman was a shoo-in for a Best Actor Oscar, but after watching Heath Ledger I am not so sure. His was a wonderfully nuanced performance in a great movie. An adult movie with adult themes, for an adult audience. What a rarity these days. I only wish they would make more movies that discuss serious issues with great casts. Unless you find the general theme of the movie offensive, I urge you to see this picture, perhaps the best picture of 2005?? The cinematography was gorgeous, and the interplay between Ledger and Gyllenhaal was first rate. First rate directing by Ang Lee. Everybody connected with the film merits kudos",Brokeback Mountain
1838,xeneaver,Excellent,10,16 January 2006,"I was surprised to see that a lot of what was going on I had been thru myself. The feelings and the emotions of the whole movie was amazing.

I kept waiting on something ....... and not a sound . I am proud that this movie is taken so well.... I fell in love with the characters , knowing i had been in a lot of the situations. I looked around at everyone in the theater and i seen teenagers to grandmothers and grandfathers enjoying this film the way i was. I guess it is about time a movie like this has came out tho where the reality of love and the love between two men shown like this . I was amazed at the ending . I honestly did not expect what happened. But.. It did the movie justice and i will go again and again .",Brokeback Mountain
1839,yokoo,Surprisingly Good!,10,17 December 2005,"My girlfriends told me that this was not going to be a ""happy ending"" film. I should have gone to see Pride and Prejudice which was playing in the next room, since that was what I was hoping for. We were sneaking out of a company Christmas party to go to the movies. I'd heard of this film as being something about gay cowboys. Out of curiosity as to what the people were raving about, I went anyway and was pleasantly surprised. I left very impressed and glad that I went. I think I want to see it again. But with guys so that we can talk about it after wards. I was expecting swishy cowboys, having read nothing about the film. I imagined limp-wristed, lisping cowboys with plucked eyebrows sneaking into Dolly Parton wigs on the cattle range. I did NOT expect the pure, raw masculinity of the quintessential Marlborough man of few words falling in love with a man and then fighting with ""this thing"" for the next 20 years. The mainstream entertainment world has given us a view of the funny gay man, the feminine gay man, the cross-dressing man, pathetic gay man, but this is the first time I have seen an honest view of a very masculine gay man and his love for another very masculine man who isn't able to deal well with the very concept of loving another man. Contrary to what some of the negative posters may think, this movie will NOT encourage their sons to become gay or think that being gay is good. If anything, this movie exposes the viewer to the agony of being gay in a world where having a gay lifestyle is reviled or swept under the carpet by those in denial. Had the movie been made about a man and a woman who carried on forbidden love for 20 years, it would have been a re-make of a familiar tale. This beautifully crafted film took a familiar conflict (impossible love) and moved it into a new environment and circumstance that is full of conflict, emotion, and torment. I was impressed because it put together things that I never expected to be put together. It is, I think, the very best embodiment of our rights of free speech and free thinking. For those who crafted this film - I applaud you for your courage, your skill, your creative genius, and your ability to make a film that gives us an honest view into a very contentious aspect of our society and culture. This beautiful film is a work of art. And it was tastefully done. It took me right to the edge of what I find acceptable to watch and no further (Thank God!). For me, a good film's subject does not have to be one that I agree with as a life style choice or one that I find pleasant. But it has to be well-presented. City of God comes to mind as an example of a film that was incredibly beautiful and awful as a subject at the same time. A great film has to hit me over the head and sweep me away with it. This film did it all and then some. Kudo's to all who worked on it! And if you can't stand the idea of watching ""gay cowboys"", go see this anyway, but don't take the kids. It's for real grown-ups only. Just let your eyes blur over the one love scene at the beginning. That's the only part that made me squirm. You'll be OK with the rest. Don't worry, none of the sheep has a bad experience except the one that gets eaten by the coyote. Enjoy the scene at Thanksgiving. Our audience cheered. And take a hankie. You might have to dab at your eyes.",Brokeback Mountain

I think as a whole that that has been very positive. For it has changed the way that I deal with people everyday in every way. It has strengthen my relationships with those I love and consider very close to me. I feel that it has helped me to not be afraid to say and show those I am close to that I love them and care for them deeply, and remembering that they could be lost to me at any time. That is why it is not easy to get out of you head, but that we never know who we will lose next. For those reasons I hope that the movie will always stay with me.",Brokeback Mountain

This movie depicts this agony very well. It also shows the pain and brokenness brought into the lives of innocent spouses and children. I've adopted the slogan, ""Let us marry each other and we'll quit marrying you."" As a clinical psychologist, I understand human suffering and appreciated the depth of this movie...of each character.

I loved this movie from the second i watched it, usually movies are totally boring at the first and from on they get better. For Brokeback Mountain it got better and better to a point where I didn't want to leave the Movie theater when the credits where on and my eyes were cloudy with tears. This is my all time favorite movie. Instead of 2 1/2 hours it felt like 30 minutes long. If you are a homophobe or not this movie is the al time greatest movies ever made. The day this movie comes out on DVD I'm buying it. I get turned on by Gays men and Heath and Jake are the sexiest Cowboys. favorite part is when they don't see each other for a really long time and then the My finally do and they get really exited and start hugging each other and the they go on the side of the house and start making out.",Brokeback Mountain

As it went by, I experienced a mix of excitement, erotic tenderness, sadness, happiness, I guess all feelings that can felt by a human being, that has had the capacity to love and have been loved.Jack and Heath delivered their best performances ever. Being a gay man in my late 20's, I consider myself open minded enough to make clean honest criticism, and this, in my opinion is ""As good as it gets"". It made me cry more than I have cried in a good while ! It rocked my world and I don't think I will ever forget this movie...-Ivan",Brokeback Mountain

Two men, brought together by an insatiable force, unable to be together. It makes the heart ache for them, knowing that they cannot openly be together. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were nothing short of genius. They captured both of their characters perfectly and made their interactions completely realistic and believable. Your heart goes out the them in the end. If you have not seen this film, find it in the theatre nearest to you and see it. It was gut-wrenching and beautiful, tugging on all the right heart strings. You will never forget this film after you see it. Its story will haunt you and force you to rethink your definition of love. It is absolutely amazing.The best part about this film I thought was that it followed the short story so closely. Purchase the short story, read it and read it again.

It is rich and subtle at the same time, and I think this is why the sadness is so unforgettable. It's for sure a heart-breaking movie that stays in the heart. During the movie, there are a few things that you might not get immediately, but afterwards, it comes to you and haunts, making it even more emotional. For sure I am going back to the theatre to see it again - just to go through the sad yet beautiful story again. It is also excellent in the sense that it identifies many critical dilemmas that challenge gay men, especially those in some States. Like you agree as well, or have heard it, Heath is hot and Jake is sweet. Aww... Immediately after watching the movie, it was so heartbreaking that I wish there is going to make the follow-up - finishing the story with a happily ever after ending. Definitely very rich and tasteful.",Brokeback Mountain
1847,dexpcdoc,Outstanding film - long overdue - a must see,10,23 January 2006,"I just returned from seeing the movie with my wife and daughter. It truly is an outstanding movie in many ways and deserving of the recent Golden Globe awards. This groundbreaking movie depicts two men who fall in love  a subject that many, if not most, Americans, particularly straight males, are very uncomfortable with. The fact that the ratio of women to men was about 20:1 in the suburban community theater where I saw it would further support the unease felt by straight men (a friend who also saw it observed the same ratio). A forbidden love story involving two very macho men rather than hairdressers or musicians makes the movie even more powerful and perhaps even more threatening to some men. It is time for people to accept that this kind of relationship and love can happen between any two men or two women, whatever their type or profession. Some may not like or understand it but the world isn't falling apart because of it - it's just human nature plain and simple. The screenwriters did a superb job in taking the short story of Annie Proulx and turning it into a movie. Heath Ledger's performance is phenomenal. Ennis as played by Ledger is so tormented, withdrawn, and just trying to figure it all out. Another powerful aspect is the dual lives Ennis and Jack lived - the dishonesty and secrecy in their heterosexual marriage relationships - something that plays out in real life all the time. Ang Lee, Heath Ledger, and Jake Gyllenhaal deserve a lot of praise for taking a career risk to do this movie.",Brokeback Mountain
1848,ftlaudfl33312,Goundbreaking,10,18 December 2005,"This movie is groundbreaking on so many levels. The story hits the emotions dead on, the cinematography is stunning, the humor appropriate, and the acting superb. While the ending is not what I would hope for in my life it is a true representation of what so many gay people have gone through and are still going through. It is a poignant story of regret, attraction, and the pain caused of societal restraints. A big big thank-you to all who participated in the making of this film! Yes people will judge this movie from their own prejudices but that doesn't change the fact that Ang Lee has created a beautiful movie both for the eyes and mind.",Brokeback Mountain
1849,jp1155,Bittersweet and star-crossed,10,21 December 2005,"I have to admit it; I was expecting a lot out of this film. I had read about it being in the making a year ago on salon.com and have been twiddling my thumbs in anticipation since. Ang Lee took this short story and the subsequent screenplay to great heights. I was not disappointed.Gyllenhaal and Ledger have a good degree of on-screen chemistry, at times I found myself forgetting that I was watching two straight men giving their interpretations of what same-sex love looks like. Although the inevitable discomfort between the two men wasn't really tangible, the underlying emotions that they have described, especially surrounding the shooting of the love scenes, made the inner turmoil these characters had to face all the more believable.My take on the relationship between these two men is a little different than most. Yes, they are two star-crossed lovers torn between the world they dream of and the one they actually live in. Yes, you really can feel their frustrations. But, I don't believe the characters are as similar to each other as other reviews would have you believe. Jack is gay. There is little question. If he could not share his life with Ennis, he would find another love. Knowing that he would move on from this love interest when rejected does not discount the pure emotion he feels for Ennis. Ennis's sexuality, on the other hand, is not quite so cut and dry. It could be taken either way, I suppose; but, my take on it was that Ennis was never able to reconcile his relationship with Jack because he did not usually have these kinds of attractions/needs. It seemed that Ennis happened to fall, as the saying goes, hopelessly in love with a man.The real beauty of the film lies not in character development, spectacular scenery, or really good acting. What made this movie for me was what was not there. There was none of the fluff and quirky slap-stick so many other romantic dramas rely on. There was no attempt to relieve the viewers' angst and subsequent anguish with the denouement. I know I held my tongue the last 10 minutes of the film for fear that Lee would leave us on an upbeat, optimistic view on Ennis's future.Bittersweet may well be an over-used adjective. Here I can think of no better description, though. I think of this tragic love story as a piece of fine, dark chocolate--70% cocoa. It's honestly not for everyone, but most could appreciate it's indulgent, rich qualities, whether they partake or not.",Brokeback Mountain
1850,tampaboy20,A powerful movie about the emotional bond two people can have.,10,18 December 2005,"It is hard for me to speak as eloquently as the movie was told, but Brokeback is just an amazing story about how two people can bond and love each other without ever speaking it. I am thoroughly impressed with the direction and cinematography of the movie not to mention the most powerful acting I have seen in a long time! It seems that most movies, anymore, are just entertaining, that you walk away and feel good, having enjoyed the two or so hours you spent watching it. Brokeback left me thinking about how wonderful it is going to be when I find my soul mate. I wish all the people in the world would see this movie, maybe then people would realize being gay is not about who someone sleeps with, but whom they love!",Brokeback Mountain

I love that it's bringing our American brand of religious extremists out of the woodwork. ""I haven't seen it but I think it deserves 1 star because there are homosexuals in it!"" Gawd, you people are so frightfully TIRED! Who left the trailer door open anyway? Some nut-case ""Woman for the American family heritage blah blah blah"" condemned it because it ""condoned the homosexual lifestyle."" Like she's seen it. This is a film about love and friendship. It doesn't really go near condoning or accepting anything. Most of those hate-mongering ""christians"" could use the treatment drunk Jack got from drunk Ennis in the tent (but only if they were really really good!) and would surely react like Piper Laurie, Carrie's mother:"" and I liked it! I LIKED IT!"" Amen!",Brokeback Mountain

What more can you say? I've seen the film three times now, and each time I discover more nuances and shades of meaning that I missed in previous viewings. The leisurely opening of the movie, with its glorious vistas, mirrors the slow build-up of the relationship between Ennis and Jack - the glances exchanged, the work shared, the attraction, the trust and mutual respect developing. Then the scene in the tent, where you get the impression of floodgates of passion and need finally bursting into what will become a lifelong dependence on each other that neither cowboy could have predicted nor even described.

Although I thought the movie was good, there could have been a more in-depth look into the relationship that was developing, it was too superficial. The scenery was spectacular and would make anyone want to run out to Wyoming and see the country. There is so much beautiful land out there in America, it did make for a nice setting for such an intense love story.",Brokeback Mountain

Never in my life did I imagine someone like Ang Lee to direct this movie, but he did and because of it, we have finally gotten to see Brokeback Mountain.When I left the theater, I was completely speechless. It was incredibly moving and powerful and had the right amount of humor to lighten up the mood when needed.The acting was some of the best i've seen, Heath Ledger really does deserve his accolades for his portrayal of Ennis, and Jake Gyllenhal was absolutely wonderful. I was rather surprised by Anne Hathaway, I didn't know she had some of the dramatic power that she showed.As was stated in a previous comment, I could not get the movie out of my head. The characters were so believable that I kept on asking the question ""What could have been?"" My opinion, one of the best movies to come out in 5 or more years.",Brokeback Mountain
1855,mark_a_stephens,The slippery slope of choices and expectations...and the collateral damage,8,19 December 2005,"Director Ang Lee renders a superb and restrained interpretation of Annie Proulx's short story. Heath Ledger delivers an unforgettable performance as the enigmatic Ennis Del Mar. With a single look, he manages to convey the unquenchable fire burning in a character who, despite physical strength, fortitude, and masculinity, is unable to extricate himself from the prison of his own choices. Jake Gyllenhaal is refreshing as Jack Twist. There is something incredibly optimistic about Jack but, nevertheless, as youth fades, so do his options.Brokeback Mountain is the tale of two young men, who set off on an odyssey together as cowboys herding sheep up a mountain. Driven by perhaps loneliness or necessity or, perhaps truth, their companionship blooms lust and then, unexpectedly, forbidden love.Throughout the movie, despite their efforts, we learn that this is a love from which they cannot escape. Indeed, what is poignant about the movie is that their choices to ignore and escape this reality, their choices to pursue the life that society tells them would make them happy and ""full"" men, leads everywhere but to happiness.When the movie ends, we are left to ponder the answers to the questions posed by this modern fable: What is the meaning of the good life? How can a man (or a woman) overcome the expectations of society and of himself to secure true happiness?",Brokeback Mountain

1857,brianj959,Simply sublime,10,19 December 2005,"I'm an avid consumer of cinema, but this is the first time I've been moved to offer a few words to this website.'Brokeback Mountain' is a sublime production - in my view, the finest film since Kieslowski's 'Three Colours: Red'  and one I suspect I'll revisit many times yet. The 26-year-old Heath Ledger offers a performance almost too good to be possible: he's mastered every shift of character with delicacy and conviction; his screen presence is entrancing. Jake Gyllenhaal is only just short of matching Ledger's brilliance, achieving a palpable despair in every challenge his character faces. The script is pared down to the essentials  perhaps a rarity amongst American films - but is so packed with subtleties that I suspect only three or more viewings will reveal them all. Ang Lee couldn't have realised this material any better, capturing with perfect balance the silences and the words, the darkness and the light, the comedy and the tragedy. The lilting motifs of the music represent the quintessence of film scoring; and the characters' environment is exquisitely recorded by the camera.But aside from these technical considerations, this story is so deeply touching, and so beautifully rendered, that I'm still haunted by its images and moods. Could the challenge of love (between any two persons) be better presented on screen? So tender is the bond between these characters; so confusing are the feelings this bond generates; and so lonely is the experience that results from these characters' decisions  that I think not.In a world saturated with superlatives, I struggle to express my reaction to this film adequately. Perhaps I should say no more than I want this film to win every award it can, and I want the whole world to see it.",Brokeback Mountain
1858,mhominuke,Very accurate and moving,10,19 December 2005,"Having grown up in Alberta (yes, full of intolerant red-necks as well), I got an amazing sense of an accurate representation of time, people and place while watching Brokeback Mountain. I understand that this movie was filmed in Alberta and not Wyoming, but that's not really a bad thing. I thought the screenplay was brilliant and the dialogue was very close to much of what I experienced growing up. I feel the casting was well chosen, and the performances dealt with the issue of homosexuality in the best of taste. I was surprised that at a Friday afternoon matinée, the theatre was 3/4 full, and my guess is that less than 1/2 the people there were gay. Decades ago theatres were very strict regarding movie ratings & ID, so I had to 'sneak-in"" to see ""Love Story"". I remember that when the Ali McGraw character died (some would argue the worst actress of all time), half the theatre erupted into applause! Conversely, while watching Brokeback Mountain there was audible whimpering throughout the theatre at many times during the movie. When Brokeback Mountain ended and the credits came up - the audience sat motionless for many minutes - not out of disgust, but because people seemed to be trying to compose themselves - before they carried on with their daily lives. Brokeback Mountain presented genuine characters as their lives evolved over time, and brought the audience to become engrossed in their struggles, love, and poignant heartache. Brokeback Mountain is film-making at its best!",Brokeback Mountain

It portrays love between two men with such honesty and humanity, I truly believe it will transcend as the 21st century first huge love story, brushing all senseless and ignorant rantings aside. It's simply sad to see so many heartless bigots in this country won't even give it a chance. But like the tag-line says: Love is a force of nature. It's unstoppable. This film is unstoppable. It's an instant classic and will be forever engraved in the hearts of all who are open to see it. Too bad for those who willingly won't... About the film itself, it's an amazingly crafted piece of art. It flows through you like water and it has such an emotional impact it haunts you for days. A story so simple yet so resonant. A cast of incredibly talented actors who spilled their hearts out, directed majestically by Ang Lee. Beautifully shot, and subtlety, seamlessly scored... It will make you laugh and will make you cry. It will change you. I've personally been haunted by it for days. I don't have enough adjectives to describe its sheer beauty, visually and spiritually. It almost doesn't make sense to describe it. It is something you have to experience for yourself, with your five senses, because that's how it's been made to draw you in. If you have ever loved someone in your life, you will understand. If you haven't, you will know through theses characters what it feels like.",Brokeback Mountain

Although not a tear-jerker, many sweet, tender, and at times sad moments do tug at the heart strings.The cinematography, settings and personal perspectives portrayed in this film are truly inspirational and the critical acclaim that Brokeback Mountain is receiving is well deserved.As a former closeted married man, this film may help others on their journey of finding their true selves and allow them to take pride in who they are.",Brokeback Mountain

The idea of two rather masculine cowboys falling in love with each other and battling their homosexuality in the state of Wyoming in the early 60's was treated with nothing less than the touch of genius. It was reminiscent of a classic Greek tragedy. I am a movie buff, and unfortunately it has been some time since I have been moved and transcended beyond the ordinary.

From my own experience in watching the movie, I noticed a LOT of people laughing at some of the most emotional parts.. I believe the people who voted it so bad were not really watching the movie.. As for myself I got into the characters and felt their pain and the pain of the others around them. I believe some people go to the movies and don't pay attention to whats going on.. they would rather laugh to their friends or make comments. These are the people voting it so bad.. but this isn't fair to the movie. If you didn't watch the movie honestly and didn't take something deeper from it, then you have no business rating it! This movie takes a lot of understanding. Remember this is NOT your average love story that involves a man and women so don't compare it to that!!!.. This is why it is so important to WATCH the movie and get into the characters.. if you do, you might just learn a thing or two about others hardships and how hard it is being homosexual and have a little respect for others being deferents.",Brokeback Mountain

The movie goes way beyond the ""gay."" See the movie and expect to be speechless, not because it was horrible, but because it is amazing. The actors are absolutely unreal.

True, the story does centre around two male characters who fall in love with each other, but the film is richer than the trite comments I've seen in the media. This is NOT Pricilla Queen of the Desert goes Wild West! I don't think you need to be gay to be moved by this film. This movie goes beyond the usual gay/hetero stereotypes and shows that love is about people regardless of their sex or gender, and it proves that you can't always choose who you fall in love with. Heath Ledger is spectacular, creating a believable character who is as deep as he is taciturn. He will be robbed if he isn't nominated for an Oscar for his performance. Jake Gyllenhaal is also as stunning as the cinematography. This movie is a must-see -- well worth your money as it has something for everyone.

Two men, working for a pittance doing someone else's dirty-work and then judged by the same dirty men who are too cowardly to do it themselves. Instead the main characters begin to learn lessons from one another, caught up in raw sexual desire and desperately seeking love from someone, anyone, each other. If you haven't yet seen it, go.

I enjoyed it, but, as a gay man, I did not enjoy it as much as i thought i would due to it not feeling particularly relevant to me as I live completely out of the closet....though it did resonant with some of my distant memories. I am quite sure it resonates and is timely for many folks in different stages of self-acceptance. That said, there is nothing to actually criticize because, for the story Ang is telling, it is so well done.I am not impressed with some of the hype that suggests that these were ""very difficult roles....and the sex scenes, oh, how hard for them to play...such good, difficult work?"" I saw these comments made by one of the female actresses and one of the male actors. HELLO? This is pure homophobic nonsense and actually insults me. Gay men play straight roles all the time and we don't have to congratulate them. Is playing a gay man so very difficult, so very foreign...are we that alien? strange? These comments speak to the commentator's ignorance and internalized homophobia which they would probably deny.The criticism regarding the female roles not being given enough weight is unfounded. It is not their story...though their story is arguably equally riveting..... For that story, I would recommend ""Making Love"" in which Kate Jackson's performance is fantastic. Actually, i would recommend that movie over Brokeback any day (less emphasis about beauty, more about substance).",Brokeback Mountain

This is not a ""gay"" movie at all, even though the two main characters are closeted, gay men. This film speaks to everyone about what is allowed and denied in society... about man's continued struggle with his inhumanity toward his fellow man... about yearning and fear and regret - all very human (not gay) emotions. Heath Ledger is just short of genius and the supporting cast all live up.

Beaufifully shot and directed by Ang Lee, the movie relies on none of the usual melodrama traditionally found in romantic movies. The acting is amazing, especially from Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams, as his suffering wife.

The move has a way of hitting you in ways that you never thought that you could feel. Heath Ledger gives one of the best performances I've ever seen in a movie to date. Jake Gyllenhaal, while widely overlooked by the critics also commands the screen as well. There is so much raw emotion in this movie that its hard not to get wrapped up in their story. When all is said and done, this move has the power to change the way people view love. This isn't a gay movie.

With a growing number of men who call themselves bi-sexual and married, this movie lets the reader feel the conflict that gay men in this position go through. It also shows that we still have a long way to go as far as acceptance of the gay lifestyle is concerned. The movie did an excellent job in revealing the stereotypes of he men cowboys to show that outwardly it is not okay to be gay, on the inside the gay sexual orientation exists among rugged cowboys as well as the general population.In summary, I would recommend this movie for anyone who is struggling with their sexual identity or who is going through the conflict of marriage and being gay.",Brokeback Mountain
1873,caoilfhionn,Best Universal Love Story Ever,10,21 December 2005,"I am not computer savvy at all, so it is really saying something that I even attempted to register on IMDb, but I just had to say how much I LOVED ""Brokeback Mountain."" I am a big Ang Lee fan, so I expected to like this movie also, but from the first few notes of the wonderful score I was completely entranced. That a major(American) motion picture would even dare to show a gay male couple (especially a couple of cowboys!) in a loving relationship is very brave. However, what struck me most about this movie is that the story takes the viewer so deep into Ennis and Jack's feelings for each other that the ""gay cowboy movie"" reference becomes not just overly simplistic but unnecessary. This is the most universal love story I have ever seen, describing the love that Ennis and Jack have for each other, but even more importantly a love that any two people could have, and would be lucky if they did come across it in a lifetime. Even though I've seen this film twice in three days it isn't nearly enough. I'm dying to go out and buy the soundtrack, something I almost never do, and I know I'm going to cry through every one of the songs. The first time I saw the movie I was struck equally by the beauty and pain of the story. Heath Ledger, an actor I hadn't even heard of before this film, so completely becomes Ennis that it is scary. Gyllenhal and Williams are also wonderful and Jack and Ennis's wife, respectively. The second time I watched this film I noticed little things I hadn't dwelled on the first time, the most noticeable being when Ennis folds his grown daughter's sweater and then carefully does the same with the cowboy shirt. For a tough cowboy, who alternately roughhouses and is tender with both Jack and his daughters, Ennis is a complex, loving, and emotionally beaten down character. I think a lot of that has to do with his father's (and society's) views on what a ""real man"" is. My favorite scenes at both viewings was the way that Ennis's behavior changes when he sees Jack, as he becomes a hopeful, happy human being, even if it is temporary, lasting only as long as his visits with Jack. I don't think this next comment will need a *SPOILER ALERT*, but just in case, I added one. The most telling moment of how much Ennis loves Jack is when they see each other after four years apart, and Ennis waits like a schoolgirl with a crush.

Universally beautiful in its honest choices made by the cast, director, and writers.I've seen the movie twice in order to pick up any unspoken dialogue that I may have missed the first time around.

1875,laid_back_guy_in_texas,"good beginning, but ending was left disappointed (moderate spoiler)",7,22 December 2005,"Everyone has been talking about this film, and it's easy to see why. The story is original; the direction is superb; the actors are believable; the scenery is breathtaking. Having said that however, I had two minor issues with the film. And no, neither one of them had to do with the main characters being gay. I'm not sure if it was the dynamics and complexity of the character Mr. Ledger played, or if it was Mr. Ledger himself as an actor, but I felt as though he was uncomfortable on screen. It almost seemed as if was uncomfortable playing an uncomfortable and confused gay cowboy. Mr. Gyllenhall was excellent and really ""owned"" the character I thought, but after the first 45 or so minutes, Mr. Ledger seemed less and less comfortable with Mr. Gyllenhall, almost as if playing a gay cowboy was going to make him gay. Nonetheless, the performance he carried for the majority of the film was powerful and quite strong. Secondly, I felt throughout the movie, especially in the last hour, that Mr. Lee was letting the movie get away from him. The first part of the film blended wonderfully and I got involved with the characters. The scenes with Mr. Ledger and Mr. Gyllenhall were tastefully done, and the story moved flawlessly from one scene to the next, letting the story move it along. However, at the midway point, something happened. I think Mr. Lee tried too hard to then fit the next 2 decades of the characters' lives together in one hour, an it just didn't fit and it didn't work. I was constantly having to figure out time and age of the characters as it moved along in the last hour, and some of the scenes left me scratching my head, trying to figure out why it was placed in the film to begin with. Also, I think in the last part of the film, Mr. Lee got wrapped up in the scenery and tried to use it as a vehicle to tell the story, instead of having the story itself tell the story, with the scenery in the background, like it was in the first hour of the film. A good story all around, but just felt at the hour mark, Mr. Lee changed what he had done in the first hour, and it got away from him. The only saving grace to the last hour of the film was the final scene. Very powerful. Go in open-minded and you will walk out pleasantly surprised.",Brokeback Mountain

But it didn't blow me away nor did I find anything profound about it. It almost felt like a TV movie of the week to. Sure, the background scenes are nice and pretty but there are long gaps with no dialog and plenty of times when we're suppose to guess what's going on with Jack and Ennis.I feel like I have to guess what this film is about since its not really a love story as you see more about the breakup of relationships and dangers & wrongs of abandoning your wife and family.",Brokeback Mountain

They have real lives to live and live them the best they can.As for the earlier post, on discovering that your son is gay. Well - first of all you wait for him to tell you.Then you continue to love and support him as you always have. You learn it's really awkward when he goes on dates, or brings a guy home -- but you stop and think ""How would you behave if this was a girl?"" -- and behave accordingly.You open yourself to a very rich and unpredictable alternate culture; it's truly another world, one in which you take no one for granted and in which your old assumptions are best shelved.You hope he will find a man to love, and who will love him. You learn to live with the lurking fear that some irrational homophobe will beat, kill or maim him.You are as proud of your gay son as you are of any of your straight children.When our son came out, he blossomed -- became v. involved in speaking out for normal rights and privileges for gay students at school, addressing teachers and assemblies of students, working with other students to establish a Gay Straight Alliance.Is this a spoiler?

I thought the direction, acting and photography was Oscar-worthy. Jake Gyllenhaal was great, but Heath Ledger was brilliant. This goes down as one of the best movies I've ever seen because the story is so strong and gripping. This story is also ground-breaking! There is no other motion picture that comes close. Two guys in Wyoming find each other and live out a 20 year under-current of passion and longing for each other while living separate lives eventually succumb to homophobia, ignorance, and crippling fear. Its the under-current of longing that makes me love this movie. But the next several movies will be comedies...for sure!",Brokeback Mountain
1882,Hako2004,Haunting tale that anyone with a heart can relate to.,10,23 December 2005,"I think this film is visually beautiful, well acted, emotionally powerful, and kinda sad. It's really a statement on the human condition. Who we are, what we long for, and what our society conditions and pressures us to be. The gulf between the two is where the anguish sometimes lies. It's way more than a Gay Cowboy movies, to call it that is selling the movie so short. There isn't anything in it that should make the average straight movie-goer uncomfortable. Some male kisses and bare-chests...and not much of that. Its the interplay of the characters that makes for a fascinating film, especially the guys, but the strong female cast as well. A really good movie that will be passed up by squeamish or immature males, but one that anyone with an open-heart or mind could enjoy.",Brokeback Mountain
1883,paul-1848,As a gay boy in rural Wyoming in the 60's...,10,24 December 2005,"I was unprepared for the intensity of the film. I think it affected me more than my partner, because of the life I experienced as a child growing up in Wyoming in the 60's. Much of my impressions of the film are formed by testing the film against that reality as I knew it. I am sorry to report that the film is an amazingly accurate representation of the lives of many people I saw as a child. Of course being a gay boy in that time was not easy for anyone in the US. But focusing on the gay theme of the relationship in the film, misses a big point: most people in Wyoming in the 60's, men and women, Gay and straight, lived very constricted lives. The ""secret"" lives of many men was both common and often ended up in tragedy.I and my best friend, who turned out to also be gay, escaped that toxic environment when we left for university studies. However, many of the people I grew up with are still there. And the sad fact is, I don't things have changed very much in the last 40 years.",Brokeback Mountain
1884,edmondsguy,You can't help who you fall in love with....,10,24 December 2005,"Sometimes a movie about love is a simple contrivance, and you can smell it from the get-go. Other times, the actors try too hard to show their bond (as friends, co-workers, lovers, neighbors), and that also smacks of 'technical' acting. And then you have the very rarest of all: A story which is believable because the players have ALL done their homework-i.e. location scouts, wardrobe, storywriter(s), director, crew (in making the actors feel comfortable and supported), decorators, techies,and without argument, the performers who can pull off the love/lovemaking scenes, leaving you with no doubt that this is an enduring and true relationship.Romanticism and sexuality notwithstanding, when a tale grabs you by the soul (like Brokeback Mountain, plainly does), if you don't come away with the message that you'd better take love when it's offered , as you may not get another chance,(Because as my Great-Grandfather used to say: Baby, none of us is getting out of this life alive. So you better make it good.) your heart is frozen. Waste no time. See this movie and get a dose of something unusual: Niceness and contentedness in a gentle dose. Ahhhhhhhh.",Brokeback Mountain
1885,peneplainer,"It's all good, but could be grittier",9,25 December 2005,"I stopped in Chelsea driving from Pittsburgh to Connecticut for Christmas specifically to see this movie. My favorite Ang Lee movie since The Ice Storm (driving by New Canaan, CT 45 minutes after seeing Brokeback Mountain was weird). Anyway, I've read all the negative comments and many of the positive. My two cents: if you need a lot of dialog, you won't like this movie -- I loved it. I do a fair amount of backpacking in remote places -- not saying much is the whole idea. But I'd have liked a bit more of the grit and physical discomfort of back-country life in the camp scenes. I think it might have helped verify the bond Jack and Ennis formed beyond the sex. For me, that sort of unwashed reality made the latest production of Pride & Prejudice (as an example) the most powerful. I have spent days in the wilderness with my life's love -- the moments following passionate sex with him will be the one's I recall on my deathbed. Our subsequent difficulties were not those of Ennis and Jack -- but I can well understand the power and stamina of their passion despite the pressure of ""normal"" life.",Brokeback Mountain
1886,twguy2000,Worth watching if you can,9,25 December 2005,"I have not seen the whole movie as it's not even available in my country but just watching the trailer is enough to send me reaching for my Kleenex, especially the last part where Ennis hold the both shirts (one over another on a hanger) that he & JAck wore back at Brokeback mountain closely to his heart, quietly grieving for a love long lost is such a powerful image that just stay stuck in my mind.For people who complained here that the film has too few dialogues & monotonous, let me just enlighten you a bit. In traditional eastern culture, silent can sometimes speak louder than words. It is exactly this tactic tat Lee Ang (which he should be rightfully called)ultilised to deliver his message across in a subtle yet powerful way. If you are more interested in movie where people & buildings get blown into pieces, people hacking people, movies that spoon-feed you with every possible detail, then you have already made a wrong move in watching Brokeback. Furthermor, this movie is NOT about gay cowboys, it's a movie about love and one that required the audience to ponder and reflect back.For people with access to this movie, do yourself a favour to catch this one. It's a rare gem in todays' gores & overblown CG mega block busters.",Brokeback Mountain
1887,andrewschwartz1,"Awesome, emotionally powerful film!",10,25 December 2005,"I have seen this film 3 times now and I have no doubt I will see it again and again. I am so amazed at the detail and subtleties in the movie. Every time I view it, I catch something I may have missed. All the 'pivotal' points in the film seem to 'linger' for days. Even hearing music from the soundtrack will set me off emotionally. What an amazing gift this movie is. The fact that it appeals to a very broad spectrum of people is impressive in itself. There is much in this film that I can emotionally identify with which is why it has affected me so. I hope it wins as many top awards as it deserves. A remarkable short story, a great screenplay, and an unbelievable cast and director, make this a true classic that will be around for many years to come!",Brokeback Mountain
1888,jjman2710,Haunting,10,25 December 2005,"I have never seen a film that made such an impression on me. I cannot seem to shake the story, characters and music from my mind. When I am driving along the road the scenes from this movie play over and over in my mind. It has been a week since I saw the film and still it's as if I just walked out of the theater. A huge testament to the author, director, screenwriters and actors for their work. I have been an avid ""film buff"" for years and for a film to make this type of impression on me I am grateful. Maybe it's because a major motion picture of this type has never been made before, a major feat in itself. Because, Lord knows, I've seen hundreds of love stories and or films with such grand scale, but not like this. Thanks for bringing this beautiful story to the screen. I am eternally grateful for the experience. This is part two of this comment... I went to see it again, now three weeks later. I truly wanted to re live the first experience. I am so glad that I have seen this Masterpiece again. It gave me the opportunity to become absorbed in the beauty of this film, of it's performances and etc... I am still in awe of the depth and complexity that Heath Ledger brought to Ennis. The subtle way he portrays this tortured character. I also thought Jake Gillenhall's ""Jack"" was perfect. And the wonderful women...The look on Alma's face (Michelle Williams) when she witness' the reunion. all I can say is WOW. Thanks again to all those involved in bringing this wonderful film to the screen. It will definitely be a classic. Whether or not this film wins the awards for which it is and undoubtedly will be nominated for, is no matter. It has already won in my mind & heart. I secretly hope that is does win though, it most assuredly is deserving.",Brokeback Mountain

It shows how beautiful true love can be. I will definitely see the movie again and purchase the DVD. The actors should be given a great deal of credit for taking on the lead roles of men attracted to each other. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall are superb. The supporting actors are also excellent. I would not be surprised if this movie was not only nominated for several Oscars, but ends up winning the most Oscars. I hope that many heterosexual men will not be too intimidated to see this movie. This movie is should not be categorized as a ""chick flick"". This is a movie that speaks to the universal emotion of love in a beautiful way.",Brokeback Mountain
1890,Lsheaffer,A story with an important message,9,25 December 2005,"I saw Brokeback Mountain tonight.  I think it is a superb film, the heartbreaking story of two men who fall in love in Wyoming in 1963, but who can not make a life together because at that time and in that place, men were not allowed to be gay.Now that things are so open, when gay and lesbian couples can actually be legally married in Massachusetts, when we have ""Will and Grace"" and ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"" on TV, when being gay is even fashionable in places like South Beach, we might forget that 40 years ago, none of this was true.  But those of us who grew up in the 50s and 60s, in families where homosexuality was never even mentioned, or only in a derogatory way, understand why Ennis Del Mar, who was traumatized in his youth by the murder of a man known to be living with another man, could not take a chance that anyone would discover his relationship with Jack Twist.Perhaps in those times it was possible to be gay in Greenwich Village or San Francisco or Provincetown, but only if you kept quiet about it.  It wasn't until the Stonewall revolt of 1969 in New York that things began to change, ever so slowly.  It took how long - 15 years of lobbying? - to get the legislature to pass the Gay Rights Bill that added sexual orientation to the anti-discrimination law in Massachusetts.  Brokeback Mountain reminds us of the pain that people can suffer when the world tells them that they are not acceptable - and it could be for any reason, not just because they love someone of the same gender.My only regret about this film is that the love scenes don't show much tenderness between Ennis and Jack. Perhaps this is meant to be part of demonstrating the difficulty that Ennis has expressing his emotions; the only people with whom he seems comfortable showing affection are his daughters. But it makes gay love look too much like a wrestling match.Now I want to read the short story by Annie Proulx on which this movie is based.  And I applaud the team that made the film; it has a real message for the world.  Tom Sheaffer",Brokeback Mountain
1891,sarah_j-1,I swear?,9,1 August 2006,"I missed this one at movie theaters...so I tried DVD on Sunday...then again on Monday. All I knew about this movie was it's a cowboy love story, and directed by Ang Lee - the one I admire.From the production story, I found Ang lee loved the script because it sounded like an epic. I think his movie is like an epic..if you watch his previous ones such as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.Anyway, I really loved the film. It was beautiful but sad, and made me end up with crying...though I knew some men I know really can't stand like this movie...but indifferent to me, I just felt those scenes were beautiful, sexy and sad.A question... why did Ennie said ""I swear..."" .. for what? Would like to know the exact meaning...though I'm gonna try the book later.",Brokeback Mountain
1892,hotcambstopman-1,...perhaps a 'must see' film of 2006,10,14 January 2006,"I went with a friend of long-standing to see Brokeback Mountain yesterday in Cambridge; Brokeback Mountain is an essentially quiet film that moves with a great purpose. It steadily flowed from a beginning which captured us wholly to a wholly heartbreaking ending; Brokeback Mountain is a love story told with simplicity, grace and style...although the word love was never heard... 'Love is a force of nature'...used as a tag line for the advertising of this film is absolutely and quietly correct!The actors and technical personnel well deserve every award nomination they garner...and, based on anything else seen so far in the nomination period, EVERY award as well. The understated and emotional rendition of the characters by both Mr. Ledger and Mr. Gyllenhaal makes this 2 and a quarter hours pass almost frighteningly quickly; the haunting soundtrack never masks but simply supports the sparse and elegant flow. Mr. Lee (and the entire film team) has made a film which defies every rocky outcrop that so many films founder on; and has also made a masterpiece that will stand the test of time.",Brokeback Mountain
1893,arnoldashton,The phenomenon of Brokeback Mountain,10,7 July 2006,"Once in a very long while, entertainment and art merge into something that is extraordinary. In the case of a film, every single element must come together such that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Such is the case of Brokeback Mountain.But it even goes beyond this. Brokeback has become a phenomenon. Besides the controversial subject matter and Oscar hoopla, it has touched many souls. Why else would people from different parts of the world converge to meet like-minded souls who adore BBM? Or mount a petition to name a mountain in Vermont after it? Or create a web-based BBM radio station? Most importantly, BBM's message has prompted so many folks to live life with more purpose and zeal, myself included.I have seen it 7 times, and at one recent viewing, decided to list the symbolism/metaphors and subtext that popped out, just for the heck of it. The symbolism is just one of the many amazing facets of this film.(1) In the initial scene when the lads meet, two clouds appear to merge into one (2) When Ennis is standing in front of the trailer, before Jack arrives, a passing train cuts across our view of him. The boxcars intermittently hide him, suggesting Ennis' somewhat standoffish personality (3) Ennis wears a white cowboy hat, Jack a black one - indicating their opposite personality/yin and yang (4) Jack walks in front of Ennis to the bar (after they leave the trailer), revealing Jack's more forward/leading approach (5) The scenes of swarming masses of sheep are a metaphor for 'timid followers' in society (6) The image of the lads carrying a lamb (crossing streams, etc) parallels the depiction of Christ holding a lamb. This is a metaphor for Ennis and Jack as saviours to each other (7) Initially on the mountain, Jack and Ennis are apart frequently, one watching the sheep and the other in camp (implying they're not yet in love). Later when they're together, they're 'on the same plain' (8) Jack won't stick with beans (he won't 'settle' for just anything, if he doesn't like it) (9) Their difference in shooting ability parallels their different personalities (Jack shoots often but seems to 'miss' the mark a lot while Ennis often hits the mark revealing his carefulness versus Jack's carelessness) (10) Jack's rodeo career reflects his unreserved personality (11) Ennis says ""the tent don't look right"" indicating his desire for things to 'look and be' right/accepted (12) Religious judgment is revealed when Jack says 'folks like you and I march off to hell' (can be interpreted as gay people) (13) There's a full moon on the night they first physically 'connect' (14) The suddenness of the initial love scene represents those sublime, unexpected moments in life we never see coming - they just happen! (15) Death of the sheep that Ennis discovers the next morning is a 'punishment' for the sexual encounter the night before (16) The only time we see the lads naked are when they're on BBM (the physical nakedness is a metaphor for their emotional exposure to each other) (17) Jack 'ropes' Ennis on their last day on Brokeback (shows he's more forward, and foreshadows his desire to be with him) (18) Upon their departure, the sky shows a cloud separating into two (19) Ennis' wedding seems more like a funeral than a wedding celebration (symbolizing the death of his innocent and euphoric time on BBM) (20) The physical beauty of BBM is in stark contrast to the ugliness of their 'existence' off BBM (where generally you see unsightly homes or trailers) (21) The July 4th fireworks behind Ennis parallels his explosive nature brooding under the surface (22) Ennis is always polite (he says 'thank you' a lot) - he was taught that it's the right thing to do (23) Ennis often tucks in his shirt - outward appearances are important (24) Joe Aguirre throws the keys at Ennis in the trailer - indicates how poorly he thinks of the lads (25) Jack's father-in-law throws the car keys at him - indicates how poorly he thinks of him (26) Jack drops the car keys - implying he doesn't measure up to his father-in-law (27) Jack's cowboy hat is always worn higher than Ennis' hat (suggesting he's open and gregarious) (28) The quadruple entendre (when Ennis tells Jack's father, ""I can't begin to tell you how sorry I feel"" This is typical when one comforts another, but it also reveals how Ennis is unable to share his thoughts to a man blindsided by his own prejudice. Thirdly, Ennis cannot talk about these things 'in this place, at this time' (Wyoming), and finally, he is incapable of doing so - he's hamstrung by his inability to convey his feelings) (29) Ennis says ""I'm just sending up a prayer of thanks"" (referring to Jack forgetting the harmonica, but also interpreted as thanks for their special love, or the chance to get together again, etc) (30) The hailstorm foreshadows rocky times ahead (31) The river scenes - represents the passage of time (32) Jack and Ennis' love represents the complete and most relished loves of our own lives (33) Jack and Ennis' experience/love is a metaphor for our own most cherished experiences which can never be recaptured (34) Jack and Ennis' attempt to recapture BBM ultimately fails (this parallels our own failed attempts to rekindle the rare blissful moments/events in life) (35) The pace of the film reflects the pace of life in the 'hinterland' (36) Ennis' mumbling represents the stifled way he communicates (37) The shirts are 'in the closet' (38) In the closet, one shirt is in the other 'being protected' (39) In the final scene, Ennis' closet is in stark contrast to the wide expanse of the plain outside his window (40) Ennis' sublime, final haunting words, ""Jack, I swear"", is an incomplete sentence and echoes the many instances in his life where he never finishes what he begins",Brokeback Mountain
1894,rickwpm2,Brokeback Mountain is a 10,10,29 November 2006,"Brokeback Mountain, in my opinion is one of the best movies of all time ! The characters reflect a reality at that time (1963) when they first met. In fact in some sections of the U.S. today, conditions haven't changed all that much. These were two human beings who were in love with each other. But the time that they were born, their own inner conflicts and the world in which they lived prevented them from being together on a full time basis. While their story is sad, one of (many) messages that the story conveys is to grab for the brass ring and live every day of your life to it's fullest.

1895,raichle-1,A fateful tale of two cowboys who meet and fall into forbidden love.,10,27 December 2005,"The movie is a fateful tale of two cowboys who meet and fall into forbidden love. The story is really not a gay story at all--this could just as easily have been Romeo and Juliet and what little sexual content there is is very tastefully done.The real story of course is the one taking place off the screen where hypocritical defenders of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness (for the unborn or otherwise rich, white, male and straight at least) have chosen this movie as yet another front-line in America's unending culture wars. The real message of this movie however is that life is short and we should live it as we can, if we can, while we can. It is also a study of how hate and intolerance ruin people's lives everyday especially as we internalize these forces into our own flawed decision making.For me the film induces you to associate people you know, probably in your own family, with each of the characters and that is what brings it so close to home and draws forth such a strong emotional response. It is also an insightful foray into the complexities of life in rural, lower-middle income America--especially for a foreign-born director.If you have the time and proclivity, I would highly recommend Brokeback Mountain.",Brokeback Mountain
1896,ptrceccare,You have to see this movie!,10,27 December 2005,"I was very moved not only by the story, but completely enveloped by the characters and the actors that portrayed them. I never once felt like Heath (Ennis) and Jake (Jack) were acting. Especially Heath! Wow, what a performance. He was strongest when he was saying nothing, but emoting the feelings he couldn't express outwardly about the way he felt about Jack. One such moment was when he was leaving Jack for the first time and walked into an alley and just completely broke down in deep sobs. You could also sense his sadness when he was sitting on the mountain, just before they left to come down the first time. He didn't want to leave him, but couldn't do anything else but get into a fist fight with him. I also felt incredible emotions when he found his lost shirt, wrapped around by Jacks that he thought that he lost so many years before. It was Jacks embrace to him. Blood stains and all. It's been 24 hours since I saw the movie and I came away in a very thoughtful mood. I'm still thinking about it, because it could have turned out so many different ways and it makes you wonder.Ang Lee did an incredible job telling the story. It unfolded slowly (maybe too slow for some) but I really understood why. The pace is one of the things that makes the movie so great. It gives you time to wonder about ""why"" or ""why not"" or ""how can they get together"" in and amongst the challenges of their daily lives. That aspect of the movie was dynamic. Also, Ennis mumbles a lot and you couldn't always understand what he was saying, like he talked a lot anyway. But you aren't supposed to. It's more about what he doesn't say, or what you can't understand, and more about feeling his emotions, watching his body language, looking into his eyes that are saying so much more.This was a top acted movie. All of the actors were incredibly cast, the screen play one of the best I've experienced, and the cinematography was outstanding.Kudo's to everyone who was involved in this movie. It's not a gay love story, it's a love story about two people who love each other so intensely that I just hope that I really have the same thing in my relationship.It's a must see. I can't wait until it's released for purchase. I'm looking forward to having it in my permanent DVD library.",Brokeback Mountain
1897,feudoj,Powerful,10,27 December 2005,"I have been waiting for this movie for the last month and I have to say, worth the wait!!!

It showed an intimate relationship between two people that endured over years, it showed the rough side, it showed the soft side, it showed the caring, it showed the angry side, it showed the grief, and it showed the loss of a lover, and thru it all, they were lovers whether Ennis wanted to admit it or not, he loved Jack to the end, I hate to think Jack met such a powerful end, and I hate even more the fact that Ennis grieved the rest of his days without his friend, his lover. You never know what you've got until it's gone, tell the ones you love, that you love them everyday, because you might find yourself weeping, thinking of a love past Thank you E.

1898,emma_computer,A powerful and compelling love story,9,7 January 2006,"It's been a week since I've seen the movie, and I'm still listening to the theme songs and reminiscing each moment of it. The emotional scenes are still lingering through my mind. There's just so much complexity to Brokeback Mountain that it gets u into thinking, a lot. The characters don't speak much. I think that's the beauty of the script because there's so much left unsaid between Jack and Ennis, but they are able to connect in a way that's ineffable through words. Brokeback Mountain is a thwarted love story between two ranch-hands back in 1963. Heath Ledger portrayed Ennis Del Mar remarkably. He's so into his role and gotten even deeper into the story as the author intended. Through his performance we can tell that Ennis is an inarticulate, introverted, old-fashioned, and simplistic cowboy. He doesn't say much because he's much unsure of who he really is and keeps his feelings bottled up. Jake Gyllenhaal played Jack Twist, who is more outgoing, idealistic, and irrational. His optimism makes him want to make his relationship with Ennis to work out as perfectly as he planned. Jack is more expressive of his feelings and is not afraid to do what he wants. The two characters seem to be quite different and possess opposite personalities, I guess this is why they say that ""opposites attract"". Ang Lee had done a terrific job in producing this brilliant film. The whole atmosphere of the movie is tranquil, suspenseful, and sometimes sentimental. It takes the audience into an emotional journey, and it's so engaging to almost everybody that it affects the audience as a whole. This movie is also very thought-provoking because it explores the theme of love in general(not just homosexuality). It proves the fact that love is a force of nature, u can't control who u fall in love with and it can be something irrational and impulsive that hangs onto you and forces u into unimaginable places. I think the tragic downfall of the lovers is the striking difference between their personalities values. They wanted different things in life and had to take on different paths, therefore they cannot be together. It was also an intolerant society that restricted their freedom to express their love or to live together happily ever after. There may be some nudity and sexuality in the movie, but there's so much meaning behind the sex. Anyone who had fell in love before can relate to this movie, regardless of heterosexual or homosexual love. Because the two cowboys remind u that there's always someone who pulls u completely out of yourself and u fall completely head to heels in love. I think Brokeback Mountain also serves as a wake-up call to those who discriminates homosexual love. It proves that homosexual love possess exactly the same elements as the love between heterosexuals. And if people are still prejudiced about homosexuals, they should at least consider giving true love a chance. It's gotta be one of the best movies I've seen this year. It's very profound and moving. I hope everyone will enjoy it as much as I did.",Brokeback Mountain
1899,undone001,Broken by a film...,10,27 December 2005,"I'm 23, and I find it hard to write this review. I saw the film exactly  one week ago today and not a moment has gone by when I don't ache. It  finds me in the shower; it haunts me in bed; it has filled my mind and  clings to my thoughts, and it won't let up. I try to lie to myself, to  find some solace by saying that it's just a movie, but I know better.  Jack and Ennis are alive, and they represent so many aching people, so  many untold stories. There is no contrivance, no manufactured  importance; there are no tricks. Brokeback Mountain tells, with painful  honesty and frankness, the story of two men's lives and nothing more.  Whether you are gay or straight, it doesn't hit close to home: it hits  you. Brokeback Mountain is a place we all most desperately yearn to go.  It's where we can be free.  It feels funny to say that Brokeback Mountain is my favorite film of  all time, because I think it almost an injustice to call it a film at  all, or to critique its incredible technical sophistication. Somehow  Brokeback Mountain transcends that. I could hear a thousand speeches  celebrating diversity or read a hundred love stories and not be  absolutely broken in just two hours as I was after this film. I've  never felt waves of nausea come over me as I did sitting in that  theater, my face contorted as I watched truth and honesty spill from  the screen and onto moviegoers who had no idea what they were in for.  I am usually the first to point out bias, so I know my words might be  mistaken for favoritism or blind loyalty. They should not. This movie  will change your existence. I find so many things in my life trivial  now in the wake of this film---for me, watching it was truly like  having a near-death experience. And am I better for it? Yes. Broken and  undone, but better.  For once in my life, I feel hope, and I've seen love.",Brokeback Mountain
1900,congold,"Astonishing, Numbing, and Resonant",10,27 December 2005,"I have never been as profoundly moved by a motion picture as I was by Brokeback Mountain. I sit here, having seen the film hours ago, and still feel numb and hollow, as if the movie has grabbed me and won't let me go. Will everyone feel this way? Maybe, maybe not. As a gay man I may be more 'in tune' with it, I guess, but this is at its core not a gay movie. It's a human movie. This is a real love story, as heartbreaking as it is beautiful.Heath Ledger makes a star turn in this film. If this doesn't get him the Oscar, there is no justice in the industry. Gyllenhaal is wonderful as well, and the women manage to hold their own. Michelle Williams is fantastic, and Anne Hathaway does a lot of great things with a relatively minor role (in comparison to the other three).I sit here still processing this movie, still upset by the tragedy, still undergoing that hollow feeling. Hopefully writing this will help me express it and process it better. See this movie. You won't be disappointed.",Brokeback Mountain
1901,jdfarmer89,This movie is wonderful. And there are some important reasons.,10,9 January 2006,"This is an amazing film for many reasons, most of them mentioned by the hundreds of people who have already posted reviews. It is a perfect adaptation of an amazing, devastating story, magnificently scored and directed, superbly acted by all members of the cast, and haunting, haunting, haunting. I, like so many, cannot get Jack and Ennis out of my mind. But there are a couple of things that I'm compelled to say here.First, so many people are saying ""this isn't a gay cowboy movie, it's a universal love story that anyone can relate to."" Well, this comment, while true in some sense, misses the point: yes, it's a story that transcends its particulars, but can we ask ourselves why it's surprising that a story about two gay cowboys (which it is) could be an example of universal love? Why can a story about a couple of rich straight kids (Romeo and Juliet) touch universal themes, and gay love not? Is it because people don't have the imagination to understand the simple fact that (poor, rural) gay people are human, and so their stories have human dimensions and can embody universal human themes? This story IS a story about gay cowboys, AND a universal story of lost, thwarted, impossible love. Get it? Second, although I'm very glad that people noticed that the film is about love, so many seem to have missed that it is also a film about homophobia and the tremendous damage that it did to every single character: from Jack and Ennis (obviously) to their wives and children (just as obviously) but also to Jack's parents, and Ennis' waitress friend. While taking the 9-year old Ennis to see the societally-induced results of gay love in Wyoming may have saved his life (""this thing grabs ahold of us at the wrong place, the wrong time, and we're dead""), at what terrible, terrible cost? Thirdly, there seems to be among some a misconception that Jack seduced (one comment said ""raped"") Ennis. Well, when Jack made his move, Ennis had lots of options, from kicking him out of the tent, to socking him in the nose, or just saying no. Instead he rolls Jack over and goes after him ferociously. Of course it's rough; these guys haven't known anything but rough their whole lives. All that aside, has everyone forgotten what it was like to be 19 and not understand or even know what kind of power was grabbing ahold of you? What it was like to start shaking simply because you could *smell* someone? Or feel like the touch of your love had taken you to heaven? Shame, shame, silly people.In any case, I'm so grateful for this movie I can't really express it. It's going to help thousands of gay men come to terms with the impossible, lost loves we had as youngsters and heal from some of the pain and fear that this truly violent and sick society has filled us with. It's also helping thousands of straight folks ""get it"" in a new way, not just understanding that gay people are human, but seeing, feeling and dreaming it, through the magic of this near-perfect film. Thanks to everyone who made it.",Brokeback Mountain
1902,aejdancer1324,Amazing Film!!!!,10,27 December 2005,"I traveled 35 minutes to a distant theater just to see this film. Let me tell you, it was WELL WORTH the drive. I laughed, I cried, and overall was just emotionally moved by this film. The actors and actresses deliver, real & all too believable performances, especially the two leading men. I believe it's going to breakdown a lot of walls and stereotypes and it's about time it's happened. This film is an inspiration and I highly recommend it to all. Ang Lee does a beautiful job of telling an amazing story and yet capturing the true beautiful of the scenery as well as the relationship. I beg people to take time and see this. You won't regret it!",Brokeback Mountain
1903,charles-340,A rendering of the human condition in classical tragic form,10,28 December 2005,"""Two men who fall in love with each other"" is as inappropriately simple a description of this film as any attempt to justify the human condition that engulfs their lives would be acceptable. A story that closes in tight on the idealistically dreamed of world where individual and unique qualities of a human super-cede gender as a precluding rule of engagement. There is an uncommon expression here of the human possibility for self release, from the expected roles and accepted impulses of love. The mutual attraction is against what each knows instinctively, without comment or discussion, is ""wrong"" in their world. There is no judgment or preaching here as to the right or wrong of their friendship because the inherent rejection of their feelings by everyone in their world is fundamentally understood. The wonderful thing in this film is that the two men offer and share this secret with a presence and submission that avoids the self questioning angst so often thrust upon characters who for moral and box office approval must twist in turmoil and guilt. It is not a film about gay men. It is a film about two men. Period. They like each other and cannot stop from taking this attraction to levels so intense that the tragedy rests in seeing a human condition unable as yet to allow this attraction to simply blend into the scape of life without undo attention or judgment. To dislike this story you must be more than homophobic, you must be human-phobic.",Brokeback Mountain
1904,jefarrarjr,Overall thoughts on the movie (after second viewing),10,28 December 2005,"After watching the movie for the second time yesterday, I realized this film is perfect. I recommend watching it a least twice. There are some many details and expressions that a single viewing can not digest. I also previewed the music before and was very curious as to where the songs fell in the movie. Many before me have commented on all the wonderful aspects of this movie. I thought I would express my feelings and words in an artistic manner to explain this wonderful piece of ART.Brokeback - a branding on the soul - Born from the flames of ignorance and intolerance - Forged from hate - Inflicted by a rigid and unwavering society - Awaking pains from past scars and burnsLooked at from up and down, part and whole - Judged from right to left - wrong to rightLeft forever to be viewed and questioned - Reminder of where we have been - A scar for life",Brokeback Mountain
1905,melodyk,Not a gay movie,10,28 December 2005,"I don't think I've seen a movie that moved and haunted me so much since Shindler's List. I can't stop thinking (and crying) about it. If you're expecting a gay movie, you'll be disappointed. This is a movie about lies, the lies we tell ourselves, the lies we tell others and the lies we live. Lies destroy lives, as this film shows.I went to see BBM expecting something really good - how can it not be with Annie Proulx, Larry McMurtry (Lonesome Dove is still my favorite) and Ang Lee? I've been married to the same man for forty years, so I don't understand the gay thing. I do understand love - love for one special person who you can always trust with every bit of your being, love for your children who come out of your body and grow to be something special. With all the hate and fear in this world, we need more movies like this.So set your fears aside and go see this movie. sit there and just be. You'll be glad you did.BTW isthvs - your review was incredibly beautiful, right on and I enjoyed reading it.",Brokeback Mountain
1906,scfantana,I Want My Moneyback Mountain (Warning: Spoiler potential),3,3 January 2006,"Brokeback Mountain was, at best, an average movie. The acting is believable and Ang Lee's camera certainly captures the breadth and grandeur of the local landscape. The story, however, falls away to vapor amidst the gratuitous homosexuality and the film's failure to realize that viewers appreciate realism. The film abandons realism at key junctures merely to satisfy the plot, which, if you know anything about writing and plotting, is a big no-no. What do I mean? For the first twenty minutes of the film, we witness two young cowboys herding sheep in the Wyoming Rockies and cautiously becoming friends. The only speck of build-up to a sense of sexual tension is a superfluously hazy nude scene of Ennis (Ledger's character) washing his man equipment while Jack (Gyllenhaal's character) cooks beans and steals barely perceptible peripheral glances. Apart from that, all that happens that suggests some form of evolution from just friendship is when Jack pats a cloth to a head wound Ennis has sustained, only to have Ennis immediately take the cloth and take care of it himself.A little more sheep herding ensues, an elk kill to avoid another night of beans, and exchanges of benign banter. Next thing you know, Ennis and Jack are inside a tent clawing passionately at their drive-in movie screen belt buckles to strip them off. Huh? Were we to just assume that an undeniable attraction had been engendered between them? One moment engaged in the manly acts of herding, hunting, and stuffing down beans, the next lascivious sin in the tent? Sorry, it doesn't work. With virtually no build-up whatsoever to the tent tryst, the viewer is left wondering what exactly the precipitating motivators were. Because both were lonely, shy, awkward cow pokes? Not good enough. Not strong enough. The movie nosedived here and never recovered.The realism was further assaulted when Jack first came to visit Ennis after four long years of separation and silence. I realize Ennis was not meant to be the brightest filament in the chandelier. But, c'mon, is it truly believable that he would ravage Jack at the bottom of the steps that lead up to the front door of his apartment, especially with his wife and children right inside? Did unbridled passion cause Ennis to forget that doors can be opened and windows peeked through? No. Simply, they needed a way for Ennis's wife (Michelle Williams) to find out, so the tension of her knowing the secret could play out, and ultimately lead to the demise of the marriage.The problem with this is that we are expected to overlook and/or forgive a great deal. Maybe you could, but I could not. Also, manufacturing tension for nothing more than the sake of there being tension is never as effective as when tension naturally occurs from good writing. Not the case here. Everything, especially the way Ennis's wife learns about him and Jack, feels contrived and nothing more than a succession of plot band aids.Another issue I had is that the movie is billed as a prolific love story. A love story typically implies that two people are, more or less, equally and madly in love with each other. If you take some time, though, to really analyze the behavior of both characters, you begin to realize that the love is far more palpable in Ennis than in Jack. Ennis is the lonely, dumb, pathetic sort. I believe that his relationship with Jack was more about the bond than about the homosexuality. For Jack, however, it can be safely discerned that his primary motivation was more about the homosexuality and less about the bond. Jack was more the bona fide homosexual. Ennis was a just a lost, lonely sad sack who could have just as easily fallen in love with one of the sheep he was herding as with Jack. I don't say that in the context of mockery or crudeness, but rather to demonstrate that Ennis was a vulnerable, sullen soul who was oblivious to just how desperate he was to love and be loved. Jack, the more free spirited of the two, was simply in the right place at the right time to unlock this torturous yearning in Ennis.Jack, however, had no problem having his little benders down to Mexico for interim quickies with homosexuals-for-sale. He also didn't seem to think about Ennis when he tried to pick up a guy at a bar or set to romping with his wife's friend's husband (although that affair was more implied than confirmed). So, was this truly a love story? Or was it one poor fool in love and another willing to drive several hundred miles each way, once a month eventually, to satisfy his homosexual hunger?One mildly touching aspect, and perhaps the high point, of the film is Ennis's seemingly incurable loneliness. You can't help but feel sorry for the guy, especially when he loses the one thing in his life that brought him any semblance of true happiness. The ending scene with him standing there surveying the emptiness of his trailer is actually pretty profound. If there is a redeeming virtue to this film, it is Ennis's prevailing sadness, and Ledger's portrayal of it.The ending, though, like the majority of the film, is formulaic and unfulfilling. I went along on the ride, I expected a more satisfying payoff. While some will label this film revolutionary, those who trudge past the hype and are willing to see the film for what it really is will realize that 'revolutionary' is an inaccurate description. Rather, this movie is an inharmonious mating of The Horse Whisperer and Philadelphia.Oh, and is it too much to ask that one of the *professionals* who edited this film might have caught that Leger's portrayal of an unrefined cowboy sounded disturbingly akin to Karl from Sling Blade?",Brokeback Mountain
1907,allaire_p,"Brilliant, sensible and tragic",10,28 December 2005,"Well, all of you that wrote it before were right. This film is haunting me since I saw it 2 days ago. The music haunts me too. One of the rare time in my life I lived such a moving experience in a theater. Thanks Ang Lee, you made a diamond out of an excellent scenario no one would dare to take to the big screen before. Thanks to all the fabulous actors and actresses. Heat Ledger is just miraculous. Thanks to the whole crew, you all gave your best and more. Now, will The Academy give this movie what it deserves? From the Art point of view, it is a masterpiece. All is there, cinematography, direction, acting, music, scenario and... a lot of guts from those who were involved in the making of this film. I wish you: Best Film, Best Director, Best Scenario, Best leading actor (Ledger), Best supporting actor (Gyllenhall), Best supporting actress (Williams), Best music score, Best original song, Best Cinematography... Well that makes 9, not a record but not bad for a so-called gay-cowboy movie, actually my best wish would be Ledger and Gyllenhall being both nominated for Best leading actor... and wining in both.

1908,forbes2800,One of the best movies I've ever seen,10,28 December 2005,"When I first saw the trailer for Brokeback Mountain, something tugged at my heart in a way most other trailers do not. The mixture of sweeping landscapes and rugged men working together definitely appealed to me. But the movie goes way beyond two cowboys falling in love. Besides being a moving story that appeals to straights and gays alike, Brokeback Mountain is a movie that just stays with you for days afterwards. I'm trying to figure out why. The nature of this story, that it could happen to any pair of guys, anywhere, somehow makes it more believable and more important. If you want to see a movie that can grab you and go deeper than you thought a movie could, this is the one to watch.",Brokeback Mountain
1909,aheary,This film should be seen by people who no longer think there are good movies out there!,10,28 December 2005,"For some reason this movie has affected me like no other. Saw it the day it opened and was obsessed by it. Have seen it twice more and plan to take others to see it again. The scenery alone is enough to want to see it, but the depth of feeling it evokes makes this movie a ""must-see"" for those, like me, who have felt that all the good movies have already been made and there is nothing left to experience from a film. This should be seen by lots of people! This is not just a ""gay cowboy"" movie, which is almost an insult, but a fine film about forbidden love which grabs hold of the heart and won't let go. I was seduced by the actors' credibility from the opening scenes and nothing that happened for the next 2 hours dispelled that hold.",Brokeback Mountain

1911,watch_2,Long but incredible!,10,29 December 2005,"It's been a long wait. I've been hearing about this movie for a long time and was dismayed to find that in it's opening week of Dec 9th it was only in LA and New York, so I wait for it to open here I live in the southwest a city of about 2 million or so, was expecting it to be playing at most of the cinemas in town....it should have been.This movie has so much heart and soul to begin to discibe the rollercoster of emotion and realism portrayed in this to-be classic is beyond comprehension. The cinematography is rivaled only by The Lord of the Rings (Fellowship) The actors were giving the absolute best performances of their lives so far.As I left the theatre I found myself making comparisons to Midnight Cowboy only realizing that what I was doing was comparing Star Trek to Star Wars. There is no comparison except that they are BOTH Oscar movies rather or not the academy agrees..well... Then the shame and dismay sets in that there just is no other movie to compare it to.It is gay. Get over it and you will find there is more in this movie than you have ever experienced.A+",Brokeback Mountain
1912,oletamberg,A short story in a long film,2,29 December 2005,"Few movies have gay characters in mains roles. And gays are very often not shown as people but in stead as stereotypes like the screaming hairdresser or sex maniacs.It's very uplifting when an A-list director takes the challenge and make a gay movie.Ang Lee made several brilliant movies and once before he made a fabulous comedy with gay themes, the wedding banquet. Thats why I looked forward to enjoy the sad love story of to cowboys in Wyoming.Technically the movie is fantastic and the scenery is brilliant filmed. The acting also is quite good. Brokeback Mountain is very long, actually much to long. The story could have been written on the back of a stamp, so short it is. The film totally lacks intensity. The characters are not interesting at all. You can feel sympathy for Ennis and Jack, but I would prefer never to meet the guys, because they are quite dull to follow except for their gay love. I am really disappointed. The film have missed all the opportunities to create a marvellous film with an extraordinary love story.",Brokeback Mountain
1913,oialval,Excellently portrayed,9,29 December 2005,"I thought the movie was well characterized by the two main characters. I felt the story could have progressed a little quicker and there could have been more dramatic incidents while out on their sheep drive through the mountain. I actually have a question. Toward the end of the movie, Jack's wife informs Ennis of Jack's fate after attempting to fix a tire. The tire exploded and Jack was struck in the head with a piece of metal and subsequently died. Ennis has a flashback to an incident where his father told him the story, as a boy, where three men had beaten a gay man to death. Did Jack's death occur the way his wife related it or was it a case of his being set upon and beaten to death by thugs? Would appreciate some opinion on this point.

Heath Ledger's final scenes in the film are some of the best acting I've ever witnessed. I just wanted to give him a big hug. The story is so real! I just can't get over it. If this doesn't win best picture at the Oscars, we'll know it's because of homophobia. It is so deserving. It's just brilliant! The soundtrack is perfect for the sad story. No other movie is so thought provoking this year. No other movie was brave enough to tell a story that was such a hard sell. No other movie took so many risks. The fact that straight audiences love the film too is a testament to how well the subject matter is dealt with. I just can't get over this movie! This is definitely the movie of the year.

I have never seen love like this, have you? How does Ang Lee do it? Like crouching tiger this is a movie of denied love. Like the ice storm its a movie of social misfits. Brokeback is Ang Lees masterpiece and he is the only director with the skills to show human beings in the light they deserve. Human begins who have love to give, and the gender does not matter. When you see the movie you don't think about the characters as being two men, or not man and woman. You see them as two souls entwined. Nothing more, nothing less. The scenery of the movie is also breathtaking, and the acting is likewise. There is not a moment when you feel like your watching actors. Both Jake and Heath are doing the roles of their life. The scene where Jack confronts Enis on the mountain is one of the most gripping moments i have ever seen in a movie. See it and weep.",Brokeback Mountain
1916,hobbit138,Brokeback Mountain make's Dave Top Ten list,9,30 December 2005,"Halfway through the movie I wasn't sure what I felt about the film, afraid it was going to go where I didn't want it to and become lame, over-dramatic or push the whole gay revolution in my grill however it didn't, it isn't the edgy film you suspect, it stayed a subtle film about love and life's shitty path, layered with beautiful acting, cinematography that created a world not unlike our own, and Ang Lee is a wonderful director who can touch any subject it seems and bring the right magic to it. By god the entire cast is great, everyone does top notch acting. Heath Ledger has so many layers playing through him that you can't help to sympathize and relate to his internal struggle, no matter where your own beliefs stand. The most amazing thing about this film's acting is in the women, in my opinion it is rare to find truly good actresses right now with few exceptions. The entire female cast of BrokeBack is amazing and blew me away, everyone from Anne Hathaway and Michele Williams playing the cowboy's wives, to Kate Mara playing the daughter of Ledger and Linda Cardellini (who I have loved since the Freaks & Geeks series) as the second female lover of Ledger's , and you might doubt it but Anna Faris, yes the annoying girl from those shitfests called Scary Movie, was great as a talks too much western gal.

And after that I was in the restroom and I just started crying, spontaneously, I was so moved by the entire movie, and that was due to the story, the directing, and Heath and Jake. Heath is for me the new James Dean, the vulnerability he is able to show on screen is so like James Dean in ""East of Eden,"" it breaks your heart. Jake as well. In a year of incredible performances from Phillip Seymour Hoffman to Joaquin Phoenix to Eric Bana, Heath is my choice for the Oscar. Ang Lee will win Best Director, there is no way anyone can ignore the masterpiece this movie is. And it is not a ""gay story,"" it is a love story. I am going to see it again next week.

1918,vanesin13,Brokeback mountain being considered a love classic,10,16 January 2006,"I do not write a spoiler word for word, but the movie is discussed in detail. Therefore, if you haven't seen it, do not continue. There are many opinions on whether or not this movie is wrong/right. There are arguments about the homosexual nature of the film, the controversy, etc. I feel brokeback mountain is an amazing love story that will become a classic. I feel one should not see it as a man w/ man affair. But rather two people who found love yet because of certain circumstances could not be together. That is the beauty of the story. Their hearts belonged to each other, yet one can dream, one can love yet one has commitments. They are committed to their families. They are faced with the choice of following their hearts or doing what is right. They choose to stay with their families, a sacrifice to anyone who has ever truly loved. They continue their lives yet can not forget the love they feel for one another. I understand infidelity is shrugged upon. I do not think it okay, yet this movie is not for you to judge, it is for you to understand where these people were coming from, in their shoes. How our actions set the path for our futures. How humans make sacrifices for the better good. That is what makes this a classic. It touches on human emotions, on the one thing we let get away. I haven't had an extramarital affair, but I do have regrets, and I have made decisions that didn't come from the heart but the head. Do not judge this movie on the basis of homosexuality, but accept it as a love story, a tale. The Bridges of Madison County was a controversial film in the 90's because it romanticized infidelity. It is very similar to BBM. Meryl Streep has died and asks her children to throw her ashes at the bridge explaining to them this is where she was happiest and Begin's to them her tale. (the bridge was their place/their meaning her and her lover). She tells them how she sacrificed for them, stayed with them, but now in death she wants to be with the man she loves, at the place they loved. Similar to Jack Twists request to have his ashes thrown at BBM, where he was happiest, the place they loved. How can one not shed a tear to that? Unfortunately his ashes never made it there, yet their love will live on. One can see it in Ennis's eyes as he looks upon the shirt and postcard. One can use their imagination as far as what he meant by ""I swear"". Anyway, just had to comment on this love story.",Brokeback Mountain

I loved it, everything is still in my heart. I recommends this movie. You must see it.I'm a one of the man hard to cry and sad.

They did a great job establishing character emotional attachment and the cinematography was EXCELLENT. If you watch the movie in mute, it is still probably worth watching because it is so beautiful. The acting was exceptional and I was very convinced of their love and their plight. However, I thought the storyline was sort of lack luster and the controversial subject matter of this movie is sort of carrying its success. I thought some of what should have been some very powerful and profound scenes were not carried out in such a way. I watched this movie with my cousin and we are both huge criers and we both did not even tear up. Then again, I am not a movie critic but just an average run-of-the-mill person who is surprised with all the praise this movie is receiving.

The cast was amazing, especially Heath Ledger, who portrayed the perfect troubled cowboy. If you haven't seen this movie, do yourself a favor and see it! The story was very emotional. Also, the characters who were gay were not the stereotypical gay person. Lee took the cowboy, an American hero, and showed what happens when you are truly lonely. Heath Ledger, playing the soft spoken, troubled Ennis Del Mar, and Jake Gyllenhall, playing the outgoing Jack Twist, played off each other's personalities. Jack's outgoing-ness further showed the silence of Ennis. It truly is an amazing film, so amazing in fact, I saw it twice.",Brokeback Mountain

The social commentary given by the context of the movie is strong yet not preachy. It is particularly refreshing to see gay characters explore the love aspects of the gay condition. I believe it is one of those movies that will enter the North American psyche as a milepost of social enlightenment by breaking down the stereotypes and taboos and looking at the underlying human condition from a different perspective. It is a bit like what the movie ""Guess who's coming for dinner"" did to force our society to consider interracial relationships and see deeper than the stereotypes.

1923,ewonderdog,Finally a movie about rural gay men,10,10 February 2006,"I lived in San Francisco for a decade during the decadent 70's, as a reporter, and in the rural parts of the West for two decades, and as a man in my fifties, I can testify that Brokeback Mountain truly reflects for the first time, the real situation of life for rural men who find themselves feeling deep affection or love for each other.The other movies of rural gay life, like ""BIG EDEN"" are mostly a fantasy, though hopeful, they do not show how it really is. Brokeback hits hard at the heart of the matter. The bigotry, intolerance and murderous stupidity that people in rural areas can inflict upon men who love each other is real and this movie shows that truth. Gay movies that have in the past shown only the mincing, effeminate queens have left me unaffected, but Brokeback Mountain rings true for millions of rural men.This movie shows how jobs and promotions are denied or lost. Ruinous marriages are created, and children are born -- all because gay men must conform or face punishment or isolation or even death. The courage of these two characters to at least acknowledge their feelings to each other is the tough love I see everyday in my rural town. I know who these men are, who have confessed their hearts, take a momentary comfort and then bury their true natures to survive the social pressures. All we should learn to expect from each other is to be authentic.Misery and suffering is created and inflicted upon those rural men who remain single and therefore are immediately suspect and targeted for punishment or worse. Thank god for everybody who helped to make this movie and bring the searing truth to the consciousness of millions, and hopefully a slap to the consciousness of those guilty of their cruelty.",Brokeback Mountain
1924,raywarrennc,A truly stunning love story for everyone,10,1 January 2006,"Everything said in the prior positive comments is true, with the possible exception of Heath Ledger being the better of the two main actors. It is a tough call, but due credit needs to be given to Jake Gylllenhaal. Ledger's performance is absolutely superb, but his character is also somewhat one dimensional. Gyllenhaal has to cover a wider range of emotions and does so with great skill.The movie starts slowly and takes patience. But over time, it sucks the viewer in and consumes him/her. I had read the short story and knew what was coming -- and still it hit like a ton of bricks.I really hope non gay people will give the movie a chance. It is easy to forget that it is anything other than a love story and there really isn't that much to make anyone uncomfortable.I wanted to see it myself before deciding whether or not to recommend it to my mother. I will do so now with enthusiasm. The sex scenes are no more intense than is common for ""R"" rated movies. In fact, if there were no gay subtext it would probably be rated PG-13. The most gratuitous nudity involves the unnecessary glimpses of female breasts and there is as much hetero sex as gay sex. In truth, however, there isn't much explicit sex at all because it isn't a sex flick. It is a love story.The credits following this film will probably be the most read movie credits in history.

1925,ronvan1,I WISH I COULD QUIT YOU - such a powerful scene !!!!!,10,27 January 2006,"i think the most compelling line in the movie was Jack saying 'I WISH I COULD QUIT YOU' there is so much despair and utter loneliness in his voice , my eyes teared as i could feel the ""lost"" , bleakness of his heart. this movie is one of the most beautiful love stories put up on the silver screen. both heath and Jake deserve Oscars for their super efforts in making u believe you are watching LIFE not just another movie with a gay theme. i can hardly wait for the DVD to be released as i want to study all the intricate moments that a lot of the people who have submitted their comments to this site have reminded me of~~~ points i had missed the first time i view the movie. it HAS to win best picture, best director,and all the other nominations it has been chosen for . like most people who have seen the movie it has been in my mind for days and days.",Brokeback Mountain
1926,jstn-ohl,I don't feel sorry for the cowboys: I feel sorry for the theater patrons.,1,1 January 2006,"I will first preface this by saying that homosexuality is something that needs to be accepted in commonplace society.Initially, I was blown by the cinematography. This was filmed in a beautiful place, and the story was not worthy of being told there.The first almost ten minutes of the movie had no dialog at all: I had no idea why I should care about these two strapping lads, or why I should be watching the movie. I didn't get any justification for them being where they were or, much less, I didn't even catch what Heath Ledger's name in the movie until about 45 minutes in, because he MUMBLES.Being from Oklahoma, I can understand cowboys or ranchers or whathaveyou. While I did like Jake Gyllenhall in this movie as a character, I did not sympathize for these two lovers: At no point in time was I concerned for them or what would happen between them. Why? Well, I didn't really follow what was going on for a long time. Now, mind you, I am college educated, and I can read into things, but there are just some things that TRANSITIONS are necessary for: such as... oh, I don't know, FLASHBACKS. good god, I didn't know what time-frame we were in and why and where they were and who we we talking about at times, and I was absolutely mortified as to he violent the sex scenes in this movie were portrayed: was this even necessary? Realistic, sure, but they were more out of necessity than love... which made me feel torn... Do they love each other and want to cuddle into the night in their tent, surrounded by sheep? Or are they just lonely? Well, whatever it is, they just can't seem to find it in real life, and I couldn't find it in this movie. The last line in the movie made ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE: it tied to nothing, and it got me nowhere in understanding these characters.I will admit, going into this movie, I was hoping for one of two things.1) Something that would make me feel for these individuals... I wanted to go into this, and just have some sort of emotional tie.B) Something to laugh at and make fun of. You've seen the previews... what kind of line is ""WHY CAN'T I QUIT YOU??"" anyway? Seriously.the dialog is laughable, and the stereotypes are painfully blatant. I do not recommend this movie for ANY REASON, unless you want to see these two dreamboat's packages, which get flashed on occasion... moderately entertaining, if you enjoy that sort of thing i guess.I don't know, I left the theater ANGRY. not because I wasted $10 on watching two ""Cowboys,"" but instead, I watched a long, drawn-out story with almost no dialog, repetitive soundtrack, and no real sign-posting as to why Heath Ledger got into this particular fight. Someone else, rather than the director of THE HULK should have done this. I don't know, maybe someone with some talent.Do not see this. If you do, do not say I didn't warn you.",Brokeback Mountain

1928,LArrendell,Brokeback Is Haunting,10,1 January 2006,"This was the most haunting movie I have seen in a long time. It's been a couple of days since I've seen it and it is still with me. Most movies are over when they are over for me, but this one has not left me and I doubt if it will any time soon. The screenplay adaptation of the short story (that I had already read) was excellent and Ang Lee's direction was flawless. Jake Gyllenhal and Heath Ledger were perfection and should be rewarded for the courage to accept these roles and their talent reflected by the way they were able to get inside these characters. I didn't expect a 10,000 word short story to translate into such a fine film. The writers are to be commended on their excellent work. To call this a movie about ""gay cowboys"" is sad. There is so much more...friendship, love, guilt, loss...it's all there and was thought provoking and beautiful. The fact that they are two men is almost incidental. I would recommend this movie above all others at this time.",Brokeback Mountain
1929,danrwentzeljr,Brokeback Mountain: A Holiday Gift of Superb Acting,10,1 January 2006,"Here is an essay I wrote regarding the movie Brokeback Mountain. I have received very favorable feedback thus far. UK Gay News had said they will publish it for this upcoming weekend when the movie opens in Britain. (I just hope that Heath and Jake get to read it somehow.) Cheers.-------------- BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN: A HOLIDAY GIFT OF SUPERB ACTING This past Christmas I received a profound gift. Call me obsessive, but I have seen the movie Brokeback Mountain six times already. It is haunting me like no other movie I can remember. The writing, direction, technical aspects and, of course, performances are superlative. In particular, as an actor myself I want to applaud Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal for their inspired performances. When Gyllenhaal's character Jack Twist utters the words with honesty and heartfelt earnestness, ""The truth issometimes I just miss you so much I can hardly stand it"" with a quiver in his voice, I start to lose it. Nothing, however, nothing had prepared me for the acting triumph that is Heath Ledger's performance as Ennis Del Mar. His vocal, physical and internal choices burst my heart open in every frame. He gives a colossal performance because so much of his character Ennis is about what he cannot say, and Ledger conveys all of Ennis' rage, sorrow and wounds with fullness and fire. It is in my opinion, the best performance by an actor on film since Daniel Day-Lewis in My Left Foot.Something transformational is happening because of this movie. I'm not just talking about possibly many hearts and minds being changed among the straights that see this movie. Something deeper and more personal is also happening for many, and I am speaking as a gay man here. Friend after friend is haunted by this movie. In a group of friends, we repeatedly talk about is how much this film is deeply affecting us personally. So much grief, so much loss, so much recognition. We call each other in the middle of the day to discuss the waves of emotion that are surfacing even days after seeing the film. It is as if this movie appeared at this point in time in part to facilitate a massive transformational healing among the gay men and others who see it. Some are resolving to hold onto love when they find it while others are looking up loves lost before they ""came out"". Why is this healing happening? It is the transformational power of shamanism  the true gift of acting.As an actor, I know how easy it can be this time of year for us to focus and fret on awards and our status, success and recognition we are ""getting"" in the industry. The true spirit of the Christmas season is about what we are ""giving"". As actors we possess the healing gift of shamanism. Because Heath and Jake fully committed to the truth within the material and themselves, with passion and professionalism, this healing shamanism is taking place. If you are an actor, and you had a blue Christmas because you don't think you are ""getting"" enough from your career  focus instead on your amazing power to ""give"" healing through identification and revelation of truth through your performance and then tell me you don't feel better about yourself as an actor. I and so many people will be forever grateful to Heath and Jake because they fulfilled their mission as actors in this movie. You don't need to be straight or gay to play straight or gay  just committed to finding the truth within you and the role and the story. Thanks for the gift, Heath and Jake. I hope you both had a Merry Christmas too.Dan Wentzel is an openly gay actor/writer living in Southern California.",Brokeback Mountain
1930,rdvalery,Awesome doesn't begin to describe it!,10,1 January 2006,"Without any anticipation for what I was about to go see, I went to view ""Brokeback Mountain."" To my surprise, I encountered a love story that displays a reality that nobody talks about but that is prevalent and that exists even today. ""Brokeback Mountain"" shows how true happiness can be truncated because of society and ignorance. Although I felt a wave of sadness after the film was over, I am also elated by the fact that the 'unmentionable' fact that true/clean/love can exist between people of the same sex is now being mentioned. Personally, I want to thank Ang Lee for daring to put this film together, and attempt to change the world in a positive way, and Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal for their stellar performance and care that they took to present to the world an amazing story, full of love, sentiment, and reality. Thank you.",Brokeback Mountain
1931,edmtc,It's all hype,4,1 January 2006,"It's all hype due to the politically correct subject matter. Yes Heath Ledger is impressively expressive through his inarticulateness, but this movie is endlessly long. None of the relationships are persuasive. As far as the two cowboys go, their pain is palpable but not their love.Ang Lee has previously shown that he can portray courtship (""Sense and Sensibility"") and narrative thrust (""Crouching Tiger""). Neither ability is present in ""Brokeback."" The scene flow is jerky. The story is overly elliptical: why the divorce? why not marry the waitress-dancer? The multitudinous sheep on the mountain are the best thing about this movie.",Brokeback Mountain

You must live your life to make yourself happy first! Jake and Heath do a great job. Actually all the cast do a great job!! There should be many awards for this movie. I was actually surprised at who was there watching the movie. Many straight couples young and older. Wasn't packed with gay men as I expected. A great love story that all need to see. Makes one realize that LOVE IS LOVE no matter what the sexual preference! This movie didn't play close to home, so I had to take a trip to see if. Well worth it.",Brokeback Mountain
1933,peridot2000,so many of our stories,10,2 January 2006,"I grew up in the 60's and came out early to my family, I was lucky for their love and support. I was unlucky in falling in love with more then one man that was so severely closeted by his family or his work position that he could not come to terms with his sexuality. This movie was intense for me in so many ways. I have witnessed the denial and self loathing and understand the feeling of rejection when the person you love turns you away, or runs away to the military, or married his high school sweetheart not to get disowned by his preacher father. I'm in my 40's now and find it impossible to trust men with my love because of the pain I had to endure due to narrow-minded people . This was my story and it made me realize I need to grab hold of love. Now the next step is trying to find a gay man that believes in monogamy in Ft Lauderdale!",Brokeback Mountain
1934,genegibsonp,An honest love story for the ages.,10,2 January 2006,"Brokeback Mountain is quite simply the Romeo & Juliet love story of our time. Not because it is about a homosexual love affair between two hunky cowboys set in the early 1960s that spans twenty years. It is a story of two human beings desperately trapped in a forbidden love relationship...these two lovers could be any two people where society refuses to let their love blossom. What is the most haunting about this beautiful and ugly film is what is not said and what is not known. Brokeback Mountain is obviously beautiful because of the gorgeous actors (all of them!), the lilting music, the awesome cinematography, and the unending devotion of love. It is also ugly because love is purposely smothered, because of prejudice and self-loathing, because society only accepts what it sees as ""normal."" This movie needs to be viewed several times to pick up all the subtle details...it is too difficult in just one viewing to catch it all. Then, afterwards let all of the film, the story, the actors, the love and the sorrow, seep in slowly. You will not be able to forget this honest film with its tragic love story. It will haunt you.",Brokeback Mountain
1935,rickietoni,Beautiful love story in which we all can relate.,8,2 January 2006,"I saw this movie Christmas day in Philadelphia,Pa. I went alone and was the first person in the theater. I sat almost all the way in the back and immediately got butterflies in my stomach. The butterflies weren't from going to see a film by myself for the first time, they were from knowing the topic of the film and relating to it 110%. I too had to keep my love for another man a secret and it is absolute torture! Ultimately my love and I separated and the reason given was,""he would not live the gay-lifestyle."" I tell you all this because I will always love this man without shame or apology and everyday I am sad yet honored that we had our time together! As far as this film is concerned, I think about Jack and Ennis often, and think of them as friends, and brothers and finally as MEN, who just happened to fall in love(God forbid!)with one another.Lastly, everyone who reads this, please love who you love and do not let ANYONE tell you otherwise!!!Take care and see this film!!!!!!",Brokeback Mountain
1936,validator333,An epic love story that breaks boundaries,10,2 January 2006,"There is no denying that this movie is a story about two men who fall in love. But simplifying this film to such clichés is to criminally short-change it.I hope viewers going into this film do not have expectations. This film is best viewed when you know as little about it as possible, so I will not go into the details of the story. It is an epic film not because it tells a story of Homeric grandiosity, but on the contrary, it is an epic because it tells a story so grounded, realistic & palatable that no character in the film seems surreal, no emotion seems superficial and no outcome predictable.It is a film that keeps you in suspense precisely because it challenges boundaries and somehow makes you relate with characters that for most people will not be representative of their own sexuality. Because it is non-conventional, the audience relates to characters, not because of the subject matter necessarily, but because no single life is conventional. We all stepped outside of some boundary of our lives, whether to challenge an authority figure like our parents, whether to pursue a career others discouraged us from, or because we fell in love with someone of another ethnicity, race, and yes, same gender.This is, above all, a human story about life, choices & the years that pass. I think this film has had such an impact on the audiences because it has a sentimental quality that reminds us about the years that have passed & choices we made in our own lives. Jake & Ennis are young men at the beginning of the film, only 19 or 20. We then see them move through twenty years of their life and everything that happens, their regrets, thoughts, dreams & their inner struggle. Remember when you wanted to be a writer, but the family needed a steady income and you put in on a backburner while you work as a nurse?This film reminds us about what matters most in our short lives, makes us question the choices we've made & helps us see love as a powerful force we cannot deny. It is a masterpiece that captures life in a raw & real form (doesn't get more raw than cowboys working on the land with sheep & cattle or in the dust & grime of the rodeo). The fact that it does this through an examination of a relationship between two men is entirely secondary to Ang Lee's masterful capture of the tragic brevity of life.",Brokeback Mountain
1937,paige_pamela,I cannot stop thinking about this movie...so heart wrenching...,10,2 January 2006,"Brokeback Mountain is a fabulous film...a very sad, tragic, thought provoking film with so many levels, I am not sure a lot of people will really get the film. It is not so much about being gay or not being gay, it has to do with acceptance of self, acceptance of another for what they are, and what they are not & also what we are all born into, our families, our heritage, our upbringing, doing what we are told is right by others, our ability to get swallowed up in what we know or our inability to deal with demons we can't seem to put to rest while trying to be true to ourselves....and most of all it's about fear, fear of the unknown, of something or someone that is different, not the norm...fear makes us afraid of what it is we don't know...we don't embrace fear or befriend it, we run from it, or worse, we destroy ourselves or snuff out and destroy the person that is pushing our buttons of fear..what is so damn sad is that it really isn't necessary to create such a heart breaking tragedy in our lives, if people could just 'be'.... A very fine film...",Brokeback Mountain
1938,sabrinacarnevale01,absolutely beautiful...,9,5 January 2006,"I just saw the premiere of this film last night and I can honestly say that I was in absolute awe of the entire thing. Yes it is a love story, but in no way did I expect Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal's relationship to be so beautiful, enriched and compassionate. It is truly a film about two people who care deeply for each other and understand one another.Jake really drove this film home for me, he was amazing. I'm a huge fan already, and I never referred back to him in any prior roles (Donnie Darko, etc.) Here, he was Jack Twist from Texas, a real rodeo cowboy. He loved Heath's character so much, I can't remember when I felt so much empathy for someone in a movie. I'm also not much for ""romantic"" films, but this was different. You felt as though these were real people and the story as being unfolded slowly before your eyes. You move along with the characters through their lives. You believe them, understand what they're going through. The long stares, the strong embraces, these two truly had a deep, long lasting bond. They were two people who met and found something in each other that some people look for their entire lives. The way they touched, even a simple hug, you could just feel their emotions. I've never seen a film like this, kudos to Ang Lee, it is something that will definitely stand out in people's minds. I just can't get over the emotion in it, Brokeback Mountain does what other films strive to do: pull the audience in and truly captivate them. I laughed, I cried. It's new, fresh, a real eye-opener. The feelings and attitudes were right on, very believable. There was so much passion and love, you just want these two star crossed lovers to unite.Ang Lee really put something special together, the beautiful Alberta landscapes, mountains, the gorgeous scenery, he captured it all wonderfully. Nothing was rushed or too slow. No one spoke too much or too little, everything was just right. The characters all developed at the right speed, there was good build up, twists, pivotal scenes, the entire thing really touched me more than I thought it would.I highly, highly recommend this film.",Brokeback Mountain
1939,afcn2,One of the great love stories?,9,2 February 2006,"A breathtaking account of a heart wrenching story. Both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal give touching and heroically underplayed performances that contribute to one of the most moving on screen romances of the last ten years. Their relationship is the focus of the film and yet manages not to overpower the storyline, allowing a uniformly excellent supporting cast to make the film more than simply a love story. It becomes the story of love itself. Any accusations of sensationalism are, in my view, horribly misguided as the two leads share a tender chemistry that defies and embraces the nature of their relationship. A truly moving film, one that should be remembered for being a stunning love story.",Brokeback Mountain

I've just come home from seeing Brokeback Mountain and its one of the few movies I've ever seen that made me want to cry my eyes out AFTER the movie ended... This is a timeless love story movie that will endure for years (i.e., my favorite Now Voyager). A must see for anybody serious about exploring the range of emotions that a movie can evoke in the viewer. Ang Lee has outdone himself, if such a thing is possible. I can only rave on and on about this movie in between stifling the tears that want to surface when I think about how tender and moving the story is. Definitely, I'll see it again.

How much did I really like it. Well it's the first movie that I went out and bought the book to see what the author's views were in-comparison to the movie, it was on the mark though I did get an insight on Jack's earlier life not revealed in the movie.Ah guess I might as well mention that after the book, I purchased the audio reading of the book.Why you might ask?

The director painstakingly builds the story and the actors deftly portray the roles for which they are perfectly cast. I saw this movie with several friends of varying ages and we were all deeply moved and speechless as we left the packed theater. It is truly the best film I have seen in years on every level. It is the definitive treatise on the unique nature of the human heart which depicts two characters caught up in a love that proves to be stronger than they are. There is no predicting when or where one will lose their heart and intellectualizing cannot do away with true love.

This is probably because I have never had any film ""touch me"" the way Brokeback Mountain did. I have seen this movie twice now (I never see movies twice) and had to post my feelings about this wonderful masterpiece! I really didn't know what to expect when I went to the cinema as I had purposely tried to ignore the media and various postings about the movie beforehand. When I left the theater I, along with my friends, did not even have words to explain what we had just seen (plenty of tears though!). It was only a few hours later, the tears again began to flow over this incredible ""journey"" we had all just taken. I felt as if in some way, we the audience, were living the lives of Ennis and Jack right along with them...experiencing the same laughs, love, joy and heartache! This film could not have possibly been better cast nor filmed (the scenery where it was filmed in Alberta, Canada was just stunning!).It is a weird feeling when a film like this ""haunts"" and bring you sadness for days after but that is exactly what has happened to me (as others have said). I think the universal message we all can take from the film is to live your life in the ""NOW"", don't be afraid of who you are and whom you love, and ""love as hard as you can"". Life is too short and can be taken away from you in an instant! A heartfelt thanks to the cast and Mr. Lee for a truly Oscar-worthy masterpiece!! What a performance! Ted",Brokeback Mountain
1944,jeepbandit,Breathtakingly Beautiful--It Will Leave You Inspired,10,2 January 2006,"This movie has been on my mind since I saw it. I can't get the longing of the characters out of my head. I truly wanted these characters to be together. I truly felt for these characters as well. I am not gay, but I have felt this type of pain while loving a man that I cannot be with. Due to pressures of family, friends, and society, I too chose not to pursue my one true love and passion. I definitely have identified with the characters in that way. I can only imagine what it would be like to be in the situation the characters were in while gay in those times. Living a life of turmoil and not doing anything about it because of society's pressures must be so terrible to say the least.This was a gut-wrenching movie between two characters that long to be with one another. Although I don't condone cheating, I do however understand why they did it. It is just a movie after-all. The acting was remarkable. Everyone in the film captured each character perfectly. Heath Ledger definitely captured Ennis. Jake did wonderfully as well. The scenery was breathtaking. I felt each characters pain. I can only hope that come Golden Globe and Oscar time, that this movie is recognized the way it should be.The love scenes were tasteful and only used to convey to the audience the characters feelings. They weren't over-the-top or graphic and were used sparingly. Most HETEROSEXUAL love-scenes are way too graphic and show way too much. They usually focus on the woman and show way too much! It was nice to see the ""jist"" and not have to see naked bodies.Also, I am from Middle America--Minnesota. This movie was only in 4 theaters in all of Minnesota and I am proud to say that the showing I went to was sold out! It is good to see that so many people are open to see a movie that isn't mainstream and IS different. I hope that we continue to move forward. Go see this movie. It will leave you moved, touched, and inspired. I will definitely see this movie again and I am betting that I will like it even more.",Brokeback Mountain
1945,thanh_bui,A heart-wrenching tale that haunts and inspires......nothing like I've ever seen,9,3 January 2006,"Brokeback mountain has to be one of most poignant and moving film that I've watched in years. I barely go to the cinema, and never watch a movie twice, but Brokeback mountain has left me with so many deep-seated emotions about forbidden love, and how in an age where so many of us have become so cynical and jaded when it comes to relationships ,and finding that one special person, Brokeback mountain has only increased my optimism for love, despite the characters'inabilities to express their love openly in society. Director Ang Lee's masterpiece is filled with so many wonderful nuances and intricacies in its plot, at certain points I felt like I could reap up Ennest's and Jack's emotions when they are together, and that they became my own. Heath Ledger was brilliant in portraying Ennest Del Mar, his squinty eyes brimming with fear and frustration when he tries to tell Jack that they could never settle down together because society would not allow it. When he told Jack "" if you can't fix it, you gotta stand it"" , I could feel the pain in his voice, so much that I wanted to reach out to the screen and embrace him. The most touching moments were when Ennest said nothing, his expressions and thoughts could be read out loud. Jake Gyllenhal was also superb as Jack Twist, there was an innocence in him that I, and I believe lots of us hopeless romantics embody, a yearning to be with someone, to hold them, to kiss them, to share with them one's most intimate secrets. In relations to my earlier comment on how intricate this film is, as one watches this movie, he/she can recognize the love between Jack and Ennest as genuine because the two have connected on a level that they haven't with any one else. Ennest was quiet and stoic, but you see him opening up to Jack, very much like a loner, an outcast who has finally found someone he could trust, and provides him with a sympathy and understanding that he has never known before, just like the Beast in Beauty and the Beast, and his relationship with Belle, or River Pheonix's character in My Own Private Idaho, and his friendship with Scott Favor, played by Keanu Reeves. The portrayal of the other characters' wives, Ennest's daughters, Cassie, Jack's in-laws were also relevant and moving, especially with Ennest's oldest daughter, and her love and respect for her father, and sticking by him no matter what happens. Over all, I was very surprised by the audiences who came to see the film. I found myself surrounded by older couples and women both times that I saw the film, and most of them were moved to tears. I must admit to being slightly preoccupied with the fact that older viewers might get turned off by the sex scene, but then I realized that it didn't matter, the gay love scenes, or the labeling of the film as a "" gay cowboy"" movie. The ever-lasting mark that Broke mountain in many people, I believe is that one must chase after their love, cherishes it , and have faith that even if the love is forbidden or denied by the proprietors', or society's prejudices, it is worth the sacrifice, something that to Ennest, amounted to mountains of regret for what could have been, his life with Jack . This film is truly enlightening !",Brokeback Mountain
1946,readnrite,Real but not realistic; a haunting film for the cowboy in all of us.,10,4 January 2006,"Well, I went to see this movie maybe against my better judgment and you'll understand why shortly. While watching it, I loved the scenery, shocked that mainstream Hollywood would present a semi-graphic sex scene between two men, hated the mumbling, really didn't like Heath Ledger. I thought it was very good, even excellent, but didn't think it was Oscar worthy. Then, on the next day Pow! Then again the following day and the next day and the next and the next.I had to sit down and read all of these reviews in order to sort out all of my thoughts. I was surprised with those who rated the film with a 9 and under and agreed with many who gave it a 10 out of 10but it was a few of the comments that really struck me. The number of people who talked about ""life's hard decisions,"" the ""should have's"" and the ""what if's"", the ""deadening"" loneliness, that it's not really a gay cowboy movie, about the desire and denial, about the love that surpasses gender and that it's not a film that accuses the men who lie and still marry their wives. Wowthere is so much here and it's hard to pull apart and put back together.So here goes This movie is very real but not realistic. No gay (or bi) cowboy is ever going to look like these two. The little gratuitous side shot of Jack Twist, crouched at the edge of the stream, wearing nothing but his boots and his hat, washing his clothes, dishes, or who knows. The shot is so poetic that it certainly gets the attention of most of the women and any man who dares to look. However, the movie is very real. How do I know this? Simply there is no Jack Twist in my life, now or in the past but there could have been. I've been married to my wife for almost twenty years. I told her my secret before marrying her. I thought I could suppress and control my desires and my past. However, your past is your present. I also have daughters. One of the most disturbing scenes for me was when Alma junior comes and asks her father to give her away at her wedding. Over 10 years ago, I wrote a short story about a lonely older man living/dying in a ratty apartment with only his books to keep him company and the occasional visit from his eldest daughter. The corresponding scene in the movie just opened up the well of tears. I've always had that dreaded feeling of inevitably ending up alone, a life of self-imposed seclusion, not knowing how or why I chose the life of a hermit but there I am with the occasional visit from my eldest daughter, the only one who felt obligated or connected enough to care.This movie is real in the sense that it shows the hard decisions in life and how we strive for the best choices and find out later that perhaps we may have settledhow we try to make the right decision, listening to common sense, but are nagged in our gut by the doubts of a possible wrong choice. This movie is real in showing the yearning ache for somebody who is just not there although you may be surrounded by those others you love and those who love you. This is very real for the despair of discovering that you have done the best you can with the assets you have and it is sometimes still not enough. I grew up in a similar rural community, which was restrictive and somewhat narrow-minded. The original time frame of this movie corresponds to the first 20 years of my life roughly. Just as the time line of this film ends, I go out into the world as a young adult who is trying to define myself, my wants and needs. This is really too spooky. (Who is this Annie Proulx and how does she know all of this stuff about me?) I suffer from clinical depression, which is worsening over the years, despite medical support. My wife is fully aware that the suppression of this inner-Ennis may be contributing to my massive depression. We are trying to steel ourselves for the consequences of my eventual cure. The next few months will tell. Perhaps the way of no longer hurting the ones you love is by living alone in a trailer in some obscure desert. So, as for the ones who rated this movie below 9, they really didn't get it or they are just not there. This is neither their place nor their time. But those of us who are on the inside (be it sexual ambivalence, be it one-sided love, be it loneliness, be it thinking too much, be it depression), we know that those other people can't see that they are on the outside. Those of us on the inside, we don't care about the Oscars. We may have loved the scenery as it reflects ""solitude"" and strength. We praise the actors and director as they have peeked into the window of our souls. We search out the short story from Annie Proulx. We look for validation from like-minded reviews on the Net. Yet, we still feel very alone although we are more than one.Ang Lee's best work involves the scenes of brutal harsh reality and violence that are done with no corresponding soundtrack, to Earl and then to Jack it's the silence or rather the background monotone narration (the sheer calm of the composed narrator's voice) which contrasts brutally to the violence. P.S. I don't like westerns. I still hate country music. Yet this film still worked for me.",Brokeback Mountain
1947,broadwaywriter,Please help the Christian Right find new scapegoats.....,10,5 January 2006,"The most remarkable reaction to this film has been the silence with which it has been greeted by the ""Christian Right."" Aside from a few random acts of sabotage, i.e., posting low ratings on the Movies.com website without having seen the film, the ""Right"" has been mostly silent.Is it too much to hope that even this group, so easily blinded by mass hysteria-type thinking, can accept as accurate the simple, anguished humanity portrayed in the film? If so, might they then reflect upon the great damage they have done to Gays, to their families, partners, and loved ones, by their years of witch-hunting a perfectly acceptable group of people?Might they finally have come to accept the fact that verbal and other forms of gay-bashing have been, and are, more harmful actions on their part, than their fear-based ignorance has led them to expect from Gays?I don't believe so. Jerry Falwell, Pat Robinson probably are not going to change their views. Like it or not, they are intelligent men and their present silence can be seen as their recognition that the truth of human existence will always win out over bigotry and false theology. They are merely waiting for ""Brokeback Mountain"" to run its course, before again picking up their cudgels. Their problem, however, is that many of their followers are also intelligent, and capable of thinking for themselves. Few people seeing this film can leave the theatre holding pre-conceived falacious ideas of homosexuality, marriage, relationships. Hopefully, a dialogue will begin in these deliberately ill-informed churches by which a more truthful acceptance of humanity can be achieved. Chances are, however, that the Falwells and Robinsons are just biding their time - which is good news for the other minorities that so terrify these backward powerbrokers. Thank you, God, for seeing this film safely through.",Brokeback Mountain

1949,arnold-ashton,10 Reasons why BBM is the best cinematic experience of all time,10,30 January 2006,"I'll be the first to admit that I've gone gaga over BBM. I've seen it 3 times over the past month. Here are my top ten reasons (in no particular order) why Brokeback Mountain is the groundbreaking masterpiece movie of all time!:(1) An avalanche of superlatives and a mountain of gushing reviews (not to mention highly acclaimed awards) has been heaped upon this movie. And it's no wonder why. Brokeback Mountain is stunning in every way - from the direction, cinematography, musical score, and of course the exceptional, nuanced and realistic performances.(2) No other film has so heart-wrenchingly grappled with bigotry, class, violence and hatred (and all its sources), unbridled love, and the consequences of fate and circumstance with such clarity. And all this wrapped into a romantic love story! And the fact it's all done in such an understated way makes it all the more remarkable.(3) On the surface it's a fairly linear story told in a matter-of-fact way, but it's layered with such depth, metaphors and double entendres (in fact, there's a heart-wrenching quadruple entendre at the end of the movie! (when Ennis tells Jack's father, ""I can't tell you how sorry I feel"" Not only is this an often-told line when one person attempts to comfort another with a loss, but it reveals how Ennis is unable to share his thoughts to a man who is blindsided by his own prejudice. Thirdly, Ennis can not simply talk about these things 'in this place, at this time'(Wyoming), and finally he is simply incapable of doing so  he's hamstrung by his own inability to ever convey his feelings).(4) It's astonishing how a movie that depicts the scene of a man straightening a post card and doing up a shirt button can achieve such a devastating impact (demonstrating the deep love and respect that Ennis has for Jack)  it's ten-fold more effective than any $1M/min CG attempted in so many movies today. (5) The haunting. Millions have experienced it. Has there been any other movie that's had that effect?(6) The reaction. Has there ever been such a polarized opinion of a movie? It's either loved or loathed (but primarily loved). It is surely the first time that the President of the U.S. has been asked a question of whether he's seen a specific movie. It's even making its way into our daily lives. Such as the two cowboy models walking hand in hand on a Milan runway. There are even BBM phrases entering our lexicon. (7) The remedies. People are actually suggesting remedies to help folks work through LAB (Life After BBM). Has there been any movie in which this was necessary? (8) As of today, January 30th, on the IMDb web site, some 20,000 people have voted with a resounding 61% giving it 10/10  this compares to 54% for the top rated movie of all time  The Godfather, and 56% for Shawshank Redemption. Brokeback's overall weighted average is only 8.0 simply because of a significant number of vitriolic and hate-filled reviews weighing it down. In spite of the homophobic reviews, most positive ones have catapulted BBM into the most highly acclaimed movie of all time! (at least for the time being  it doesn't help that swooning reviews like this help to feed the hype machine which may diminish a movie for some with such stratospheric expectations!)(9) The best movies are not only able to provide a stirring story and capture our hearts, but they can transcend into something far bigger. They are capable of collectively shifting societal opinion in a positive way. As for BBM, ""this movie is a force of nature"". I truly believe its timing couldn't be better. For instance, since it appears that same-sex marriage is back on the table here in Canada with our newly elected right-of-centre government in power, the bigoted and hateful backlash to this movie should open the eyes of every politician, and impede a complete reversal of how far Canada has come in this basic human rights issue. (10) All of the above, plus the outcome of a certain awards ceremony on March 5 (SAG notwithstanding).",Brokeback Mountain
1950,daniel-s-hopkins,"""One tender moments reprieve from loneliness can illuminate a life""",10,4 January 2006,"Very rarely if never do i ever watch a film twice. But this film was different, it has been surrounded by such media attention calling it the ""gay cowboy movie"" and trying to categorise it as just another gimmicky gay film, destined for low praise and irrelevance.BUT THIS IS SO WRONG!!! from the off set, the sheer rawness of the film strikes you, their are no bells and whistles, just 2 excellent actors (Gylenhaal & Ledger) and one heck of a mountain. It is the unexpected rawness of their emotions and the bond they form that will touch your heart and bring tears to your eyes. It isn't for the gay cowboy in you, but more for anyone who has faced forbidden love, felt lonely in love, life or have lost their way in the world. coupled then with an amazing soundtrack that tweaks at the emotions perfectly it is sure that this film really get inside of you.I can honestly say that this film has quite simply been one of the most beautiful and moving, with such sadness and tragedy.i have ever seen.PLEASE PLEASE go and see this film, you will leave a different person, this film really does touch you and it has had rather effected me.(in a good way)So as i stop now from my first post on IMDb, i plead with you. please please go and see Brokeback Mountain.... I'm now off to by my second ticket... it still on advance screening over here lol.",Brokeback Mountain
1951,pgiurlanda,Powerful performance by Ledger propels the film,9,4 January 2006,"Though the film sometimes treats homosexuality as if it were some strange, inexplicable force (the film's director, writers, stars, and for all I know the set decorators, are heterosexual, a fact which should be considered against the backdrop of the possibility of a film about Americans made entirely by Europeans, a film about women made entirely by men, etc.), it does create, at least for me, a mood which is hard to shake. Slow moving or contemplative, depending on your mood or taste. The best thing in the film is Ledger's brilliant portrait of a man so constrained by fear that he cannot live--or love. Watch for Anne Hathaway's brilliant last scene as Jack Twist's wife, talking on the phone to Ledger (Ennis). It's a master class in acting done by an actress theoretically too young to know how to do this.",Brokeback Mountain
1952,cooney4,Not so hot,4,4 January 2006,"I hesitate to even give this film a score of 4 stars, but I believe that the scenery and the acting makes up for the the poor story that this movie told. I'm an advocate for homosexual rights, but this movie exploits the growing homosexual controversy in the country to sell tickets. This movie wouldn't have sold five years ago.Heath, Jake and the rest of the cast are to be commended for their superb acting through such an unrealistic story. The script reads wonderfully, creating smooth and believable dialog, which they ably bring to life. The problem does not lie in the speech at all, as Gyllhenhal's monologue the last time they meet is written and acted magnificently.Shot in Canada, the film truly looks wonderful. The shot of Ledger against Fourth of July fireworks is really a majestic moment. Brokeback mountain looks gorgeous, and many of the earlier scenes with the sheep either alone or with the men must have taken some time to perfect. It shows.The problem with this film, which is unfortunately too big to overcome within the acting or the shooting, is the story. The characters do not evolve as the movie moves along. Gyllehnal arrives on screen in the introduction exactly has he leaves in the end, a closet homosexual in love with his partner. More is revealed about his character during the scene in Mexico, true, but nothing actually changes about it. Ledger's character has arrived by the first night they share a tent, and he remains the same way throughout the entire film as well. He's a man too embarrassed by his love to commit. This is how he leaves Gyllhenal the first and last time they are together.At the film's end, there is a lingering sense that the writer just wanted to end a very stagnant love story, and so he randomly does. Heath's character has learned nothing, and an insinuation that the movie's purpose is to prove that life is depressing is an insult to film. It's hard to feel bad for Heath, who had opportunities to, but never tried, to save himself.Poor story hurts wonderful acting and scenery.",Brokeback Mountain

1954,quicksilver32901,True Love!,10,4 January 2006,"Who would think that two men, such as these amazing actors, could portray such a passion and love for each other. I find the acting, the scenery and the music to be absolutely perfect. I have been on both sides of the grass, and it's not always greener on the other side, but I can say that this was a masterpiece filled with love. When you feel you can't breathe with excitement to see someone, when you can smell someone that is no longer in the room, when you can hear their voice, see their eyes in your mind... these are the feelings that many tend to forget about. Whether gay or straight, love is a marvelous thing that nobody should be denied. I can only hope that everybody in the world would have such love for someone else, as that portrayed by Jack and Enis in this film. I found one or two things they could have expanded the story on, but I guess its true that all good things must come to an end and you can only make a movie so long. I hope that more directors and producers have the guts to bring more films such as this one to life. The only part I could not understand was the very awkward feeling I had as I walked into the theater to see this movie with my buddy... I guess I have more in common with the story than I imagined.",Brokeback Mountain
1955,jim-spear,A movie for all,10,5 January 2006,"This is a love story. That should be enough said. Being a homosexual love story really doesn't say any more than pigeon hole it somewhere. These two actors say more with looks and pauses than others with scripted prose. It was beautiful to see, touching to experience and enlightening to remember. Well crafted, moving and thought provoking. What a joy to see this type of movie in todays culture of excess, right or left, straight or gay. This was a snapshot of a time and through a time where it was even more dangerous to be gay. A sad tale of love and lives lost. Any person afraid of alternative lifestyles should see this movie. It opens minds and hearts",Brokeback Mountain

It is impeccably done -- screen play, cinematography, acting, and score. The characters are real; the story is personal. I will see this again and will definitely buy the DVD. I know not everyone feels the same about the movie -- but not everyone understands the profoundness -- and profoundness and depth are not hallmarks of American culture. This is NOT a gay cowboy movie. And it is not even about being gay. It is about love, relationships, fear, expectations, heroes, victims and all the emotions involved in living and being.If you are ready, it will give you a lot to think about.",Brokeback Mountain
1957,henke870411,Beautiful but still tragic,8,18 July 2006,"Brokeback mountain is wonderful as a piece of art. The landscapes which shape the film at the start are not only beautiful, but also exiting. As a political creation it also strikes me that Ang Lee does not want to lift the unhappy homosexual couple as the most important part. The essential message is instead how the prejudices effects everybody, and makes, mainly, the families lives unhappy too. Of course also great acting by the mumbling Heath Ledger and his acting partner Jack Gyllenhall. I'm looking forward to see Ledger in his future role as Bob Dylan in the film about the artist. My only question at the end is: What did Ang Lee think when he directed ""The Hulk""?",Brokeback Mountain
1958,mkenner1,very eye-opening and moving,10,5 January 2006,The manner in which this movie relates what coming to terms w/ one's sexuality was like in the 1960/70s and the anguish that every gay man faces at some point in his life is exceptionally moving. I highly recommend it!! I cried during several scenes in the film. The emotions that all stakeholders portray is something that each one of us can relate to - whatever our sexual orientation. I have heard positive and negative comments on the film as I left the theater. Most comments were positive which pleased me very much!!! It is good to hear most people are very accepting and see the true message this film has to offer. Bravo to Ang Lee for producing such a stellar movie!!! I hope this doesn't contain spoiler info.

1959,bjsdream,Shattering and Unforgettable,10,16 February 2006,"As I've never written a movie review, I wasn't sure where to begin. There are already so many wonderful, moving reviews of this movie that I was wondering what I could say that hasn't already been beautifully, eloquently said. The IMDb guidelines say ""The best reviews include not only whether you liked or disliked a movie, but also why."" So when all was said and done, I kept coming back not to my judgments of the acting, directing, etc., but to *why* I responded to this film so strongly. So this review is a personal one, and, as such, I was hesitant to post it, but ultimately thought there might be similar souls out there who would like to know they aren't alone in their reaction to this film. So with that in mind . . .Dammit, dammit, dammit! It's been four days, seems like 24. And nothing is the same. And I mean nothing. Why does this film continue to haunt deep in my bones? I haven't slept through a night, been able to focus on anything else, eat only to quell the hunger pangs, and why oh why can't I stop crying? I start to wonder if it's because my experiences are so similar to Ennis and Jack's. Is that why I keep weeping?Is it because I, too, grew up in a very small, desolate area and discovered feelings I could barely identify -- not to mention acknowledge or deal with having had no frame of reference for them?Is it because I moved in with the ""love of my life"" when I was 19, and at the first opportunity pushed the two single beds together (as I like to think Jack would have) in our one-bedroom apartment, and came home the next day to find them restored to their former positions?Is it because I so much connect with the reasons for Ennis' paralyzing fear instilled by a narrow-minded society? Like when I was shunned by schoolmates, left as the outsider, friendless, mercilessly terrorized until I attempted to end the pain? Or when I was kicked out of my apartment because they thought I was gay? Or when I was let go by a firm's new boss because he thought I was gay, even though I was the department's top producer and had been there over two years, effectively ending that career? Or when a friend moved from another city into my L.A. apartment's extra bedroom to purse a career in ""the industry,"" only to be shot in the head the next day by a drive-by full of cowards shouting anti-gay slurs? Or was it when my parents said I would go to hell?Is it because the nay-sayers had me just about convinced that love was simply some chemical reaction, subject to the whims of the universe, only to be reminded by this film that true, eternal, passionate, life-altering love is there for the taking, if we are but given the opportunity and have the courage?Is it because when my lover quickly sickened and died and I was unable to be there to hold him, comfort him, tell him things I should have long ago?Or now, at 51, is it because -- as Annie says in Brokeback Mountain after the passage of 20 years, -- ""They were no longer young men with all of it before them"" and I find myself at the mercy of my choices? Prospects far gone away.Yes, this movie has affected me -- No. It has *changed* me. Though don't ask me quite how. I just know that things are not the same. Before seeing this movie I was paying bills, cleaning, cooking, deciding what color to repaint the cabinets. Now none of that has any real meaning for me. I meander around, lost in the scraps of life, unable to find solace or meaning, clinging to far-too-few long-ago, fleeting moments of true-love's passionate expression. . . . perhaps like Ennis and Jack.In my opinion, for a movie to actually change someone is about the highest review one can give. It's a tribute really. So to Ang and all the rest involved in making this remarkable movie, I owe you my complete gratitude. You owe me four boxes of tissues. . . .and therapy.",Brokeback Mountain
1960,jillellen2002-1,This is the best film I've seen in 20 years. It is first-rate cinematic storytelling.,10,6 January 2006,"I've seen this film three times and will probably see it at least once or twice more in the next few weeks. I haven't been able to get it out of my head. It is a story of unexpected passion, intimacy and the lack of it, poverty, what it means to be a man, thwarted lives, and the infinite ways in which human beings bring sorrow to each other. I have thought about it, written about it at length and sung its praises to everyone I know.Heath Ledger gives a jaw-droppingly moving performance as Ennis Del Mar, a deeply repressed and wounded soul. Jake Gyllenhaal as Jack Twist is more open, less repressed and more opportunistic, but equally tragic. Watch everyone carefully in this film, as all of the acting is top notch. This film takes one of our country's most defining myths--the wide open promise of the West, and the heroism of the rugged individual as embodied in the image of the cowboy--and turns it upside down. BROKEBACK gives us a whole new look at these old stories that we've told ourselves about who and what we are, showing us a new perspective on what it all means. The story illuminates the dark corners where the myths break down, where rugged individualism means keeping your mouth shut and staying out of the way, and where the wide open promise of the west means isolation, loneliness and limitations. And as the story unfolds, we see how this myth celebrates and simultaneously strangles our understanding of what it is to be a real man. I've been sadly disappointed in the response I've heard from many so-called ""straight"" men, who, when I've encouraged them to see the movie, have dismissed the idea outright. They're frightened by the idea of seeing gay sex on the screen. All I can say is, they're damn fools to let their fear keep them from seeing this first-rate film.",Brokeback Mountain

This movie will be the launching pad for a broader scope of cinematic portrayals of realistic relationships of all kinds.The story is moving, the story-telling superb.

This movie is sensual and has you leaving the theater with tears and a smile. It is at first hard to watch but then you look past the fact that their men and then you look at two people and you start to not care if their two guys.

1963,Prijamanni,The complete morality play requires attention to the consequences,10,6 January 2006,"The focus of the film is appropriately on the protagonist, Ennis, whose decision to maintain his love affair with Jack regardless of the consequences creates the tragic plot. The director attends to Ennis and his decision without flagging, unless we note the momentary look in the eyes of Alma when she discovers Ennis embracing Jack in the driveway. At that moment, we know the price Ennis will pay for his love affair. The effects play out slowly but surely, with the final third of the movie dwelling upon the ruinous effects of Ennis' decision. One final note of hope in all the sadness: Ennis' wonderful daughter, the fruit of his marriage to Alma, emerges as a loving child, one who will recall for him what might have been. All this human complexity is handled extremely effectively by the director, as well as the actors who are brilliant. Morality tales seem to be alive and potent!",Brokeback Mountain
1964,forlesstax,Flat acting and slow story,3,6 January 2006,"What a major disappointment. With all the glowing reviews, I was expecting a truly entertaining and emotional movie. What I got was a long, boring and poorly acted story. Health Ledger was trying too hard to be a tough cowboy with a southern accent. He ended up sounding and looking like a stroke victim. Jake G. had no emotion or expression on his face. As far as the story goes, the first 45 minutes was more about showing sheep and mountains then developing the characters. There was no glancing or emotional stares... just all of a sudden sex. Add to this the fact that the movie spans 20 years and you don't realize how much time has gone by from scene to scene until you see their children growing up. If this is being hailed as a great gay movie, I would hate to see a bad one.",Brokeback Mountain
1965,ashleyjbear,Why it stays with you and what to do about it..,10,18 June 2006,"One of the most overwhelming aspects of this film, and at the same time its genius, is how its story absorbs you into itself, finally wounds you and leaves you bleeding; yet it is a wounding that is also healing... Rather than fading by the time you get home and back to 'life', instead grief and bittersweet pain visit in waves until, alone, in private moments of the day, tears well-up. It's at once exhilarating and disturbing to be so deeply affected by a film. When it persists more that a day or two, albeit gently, you begin to wonder just what is happening to you.. Which brings me to my point: Brokeback Mountain is not staggering in its impact on you because of superficial concern for characters, but for how it somehow seduces you into confronting vicariously your own thwarted dreams, missed opportunities, thinly covered disappointments - even shame of your own unhappiness; so too your first loves, your great loves, the memory of love. One is ambushed by one's own phantoms and fondest memories, in potent and distilled form. It's not so much the movie that won't seem to leave us but our own soul's joys, sorrows and hopes, surfaced and in need of the light of day.So what are we to do? See the film endlessly? It is tempting to believe one more viewing will give me something more.. Probably not the final solution. What we need to do is read the text of our own life now, albeit as dramatically surfaced and illuminated for us by a film. We need now to re-enter the adventure of responsible liberty and walk resolutely and courageously into this storm that has come to visit us. We cannot out-source this profound task to film makers or anyone else, no matter how they may have inspired us. It is for us now to finish the story... As Proust wrote on the ultimate inability of other's books (or films) to satisfy us in our quest for truth and spiritual life, ""Reading (movie-going) is on the threshold of the spiritual life; it can introduce us to it: it does not constitute it.""Bon courage à tous...",Brokeback Mountain

Lee's masterpiece of love and longing will stay with you long after the credits role. Kudos to the amazing performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and especially Heath Ledger who all but disappears into the role of Ennis Del Mar. Larry McMurtry & Diana Ossana's screenplay stays true to Annie Proulx's short story, capturing the brilliant absence of dialog and builds on the supporting characters and story lines. This movie resonates in so many unexpected ways - feeling - its been along time since a movie with major Hollywood actors has been able to grab me so emotionally; landscapes - the Alberta scenery (standing in for Wyoming) is magnificent; the supporting roles - so unassuming and yet effective in allowing the two leads to shine.

Way more than a story of two people, so much more is involved including families and careers to say nothing of breathtaking cinematography and most apropos soundtrack. The soundtrack's so well selected and the subtlety of the instrumentals is superb. Depths of characters give pause to reflect on life's struggles and importance. Each character,I thought, displayed the precise attributes perfectly. Ennis brings his experiences through the movie to a place I have rarely seen. Far out. Many studied performances.

1968,TOdDmEnD,"Best film of this year, but not ever",10,7 January 2006,"The hype this film has obtained from viewers and critics is well deserved and without a doubt true, however these ideas that this is ""the best film in the past decade/ever"" is not exactly what I would consider accurate. 'Brokeback Mountain' is far and away the most masterfully directed and acted film of 2005, and deserves it's merits among the finest film achievements in recent history, though it is not revolutionary like 'The Exorcist,' 'Gone With The Wind,' or even a more recent cult film 'Donnie Darko.' The film is worth seeing 100%, I just wanted to get my opinion out there that it is not what should be considered ""the best film you've ever seen.""",Brokeback Mountain
1969,photographicshu,A really good Love film,10,7 January 2006,"Just seen the first show in the UK on 6th Jan. with my friends, and I think it's a really good love film. Ang Lee, who has the implication of Chinese directed a stabling western America love story. The whole film is under a peaceful and simplex atmosphere, but in the deep side of the film full of meaning and struggling. Especially in the last 10 minutes which i think would be the catastasis of the film. I can feel everybody in the cinema were held them breath and someone cried. I think other directors in Hollywood won't get such advantage to direct this film. We will still thinking every scenes in the film and find out the relationship between love and friendship. Just as Ang Lee said, he don't want people said that is a gay film but a love story. It's really worth to see it again...",Brokeback Mountain
1970,mjj948,What movies should be like,10,7 January 2006,"There are a number of ways in which I could say Brokeback Mountain is not perfect. There could be more development of the characters, even the central characters of Ennis and Jack. At times, the story line gets a bit too predictable and could do equally well in getting across the point with a bit more subtlety.At the same time, it has a characteristic that I consider crucial to all good movies and one which is rarely present in most American movies. After the movie, fans can discuss and disagree on numerous of the points of the film. Was is depressing or did it provide a message of some hope? Did Ennis waste his life or make the best of it? Was Jake self-centered and hedonistic, or was he just as confused as Ennis, though in a different way? Was it about sex, or did it really have very little to do with sex? Those who know they can't get beyond the gay issue should not bother seeing the film. At the same time, I saw the film in a conservative hotbed (central Pennsylvania, sometimes compared most closely to Alabama or Georgia), and the theater was mostly full and had numerous heterosexual couples. There was not one groan, laugh or snicker at the intimate scenes between Ennis and Jake. That speaks legions about the ability of this movie to tell a tale that most viewers can get something out of.",Brokeback Mountain
1971,s0456605,A moving story destined to be one of the greats,10,8 January 2006,"I found it hard when I was asked if Brokeback mountain was a good movie to find the right words,however the tears from myself, my friends and the entire audience in the Glasgow Cinema spoke for it enough. Ang Lee's brilliant directing, sounds and style complimented by surprisingly honest , strong acting from two men I would not have attributed it to previously, gave this film a painful resonance. It begins an awkward gay western, becomes a tragic, self-destructive tale of two people unable to control their own lives and take what it is they truly want forced to live in fear and longing for each other and ends like Romeo and Juliette proving once again that love can overcome hate, fear and even death. I will be very surprised if it does not do a Lord of the Rings like sweep at the Oscars this year. It seems unnecessary to say since even in my quite small city the cinemas were packed, but anyone who has not seen Brokeback Mountain should do so be prepared for tears and realisations.",Brokeback Mountain
1972,cordonoff,Emotionally Devastating: The Impossibility of the Relationship,10,7 January 2006,"This was, simply put, emotionally devastating. It started slowly and charmingly, but once the intensity of the lack--not the possibility--but lack, of Jack and Ennis's relationship became clear, I was gone, emotionally shattered, as well as my partner of 11 years.It's amazing what a difference 40 years of Civil Rights can make--and how horrifying it is that fundamentalists in the USA are trying to turn back the clock. This film is proof that art and politics are not the same, but dance together, and that the best creators are not those committed to a rigid gender dichotomy. Desire knows no bounds.Ang Lee speaks lack. Ledger was brilliant. His ""vow"" at the end, which I will not reveal, speaks volumes. I grew up out West and could empathize with his introversion, his emotional stuntedness, as it were, as well as with his intense resolve. And Gyllenhal, to my pleasure, was equally moving.If this doesn't win the Academy Award for Best Picture, Actor, Director, then I'll be very disappointed.",Brokeback Mountain
1973,snappycow,Powerful yet unfulfilling,7,7 January 2006,"An excellent story with an excellent cast, Brokeback Mountain is definitely a must-see. Heath Ledger performs nearly flawlessly as Ennis Del Mar, a passionate soul and one of two men herding sheep along Brokeback Mountain. Giving another stellar performance is Jake Gyllenhall, the other man helping with the herd.The story and events are gripping and the movie is great, but the ending left me feeling a certain lack of closure. I'd still give this a 7/10 rating and would definitely recommend it to anyone who isn't afraid to see a love story as raw and passionate as this one.",Brokeback Mountain
1974,jweyster1,Needed openness!,10,8 January 2006,"I believe that this movie is a major breakthrough to openness in the awareness and discussions re. human sexuality. I am sure the film portrays a relationship which reflects many, many human friendships whether heterosexual or homosexual. Human friendships include sexuality - ALL human relations... a major factor is the physical dimension of a friendship/relationship. There are different choices to be made and, I would assert, it is important for individuals to make the choices. I am not a supporter of artificial social boundaries, especially legal/law boundaries. I hope that this movie will undermine the movement of ""marriage laws"" in the USA - they are not needed, to my mind. Actually, the real focus should be human rights for all persons!!!! The movie provides a very meaningful, honest and dramatic portrayal of a friendship shared by two men. I am sure that ALL persons are going to benefit through the perspectives provided by the movie. I am going to be urging my family and friends to see this particular movie!",Brokeback Mountain
1975,rogerbrendan,Better to have love and lost?,10,8 January 2006,"Watched Brokeback last night after looking forward to it for weeks... and it was definitely all I hoped it would be.Ang Lee manages to approach this sensitive subject with a masters touch. The film could have gone wrong in so many places but Ang Lee manages to hold it all together. The inevitable first sexual encounter between Ennis and Jack being case and point. At all times the relationship looks and more importantly feels authentic. I never doubted that the two were really meant to be together. The natural beauty, relatively slow pace and excellent soundtrack of the film further serve to highlight the almost unbearable situation Ennis and Jack find themselves.The performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhal don't fail to convince (although some accent slips did occur) and the supporting cast is excellent. Found Michelle Williams' portrayal of the Ennis' wife particularly impressive.The film highlights the destructive power of having to hide your true nature to fit into the norms of society. This is particularly relevant in the current climate of the repression in so many countries and is equally relevant in issues other than sexual orientation. I wouldn't think any person watching the film with an open mind can come out not realising the love in a single sex relationship is just as real and valid as in a heterosexual one, this can only be a good thing.I don't expect the subject matter will allow the film to get its just rewards at the box office but it is a must see. If not for poignant story then for the shear beauty of the work. I don't often hand out a score of 10 and I could find reasons to drop a mark but for the shear mastery of this love story I must give the maximum.",Brokeback Mountain
1976,andrewgdavies,Moving & relevant to everyone with a heart.,10,8 January 2006,"This is the best film I have seen for years. Extremely moving and a lesson for everyone not to miss opportunities for happiness. The scenery is beautiful & much appreciated by someone living in a city during a bleak winter. The two leads & all supporting cast are perfect. Ang Lee confirms he is a top quality director of diverse fare. Heath Ledger is a tonic to the bombast of his fellow Australian the vastly over-rated Mel, anti-English, Gibson, if there is any justice Oscar will come calling this spring. Gyllenhaal must be forwarded for supporting actor to avoid splitting their vote as best actor. Either Hathaway or Williams could get best supporting actress. Best film, director and adapted screenplay too. Please go to see this film it is a treat.",Brokeback Mountain
1977,rainbaby,It was amazing.,10,8 January 2006,"This was one of the most amazing films I've ever seen. I'd been waiting for it for months now, and it was worth the wait. Heath Ledger's performance as Ennis was believable and heart-wrenching. This film beautifully captures the incredible and tragic short story by Annie Proulx. Many lines are taken straight from the story and the things that the creators took the liberty to add fit perfectly and wonderfully. The music is also fantastic, and even those who don't like country music will agree. The progression of the characters over the two decades that the movie covers is done very well, both in their appearance and character development. Definitely Oscar-worth, this movie will have even the most stone-hearted and homophobic viewers feeling the pain and love of Jack and Ennis.",Brokeback Mountain

It really moved me... and made me reflect about pain... The painful effect of true and forbidden love between two men, and so much more that is not spoken with words, but it was there the entire time... The connection and chemistry between Jack and Ennis is just so palpable... I felt the pain of Alma... and the girls... wondering about the mystery of their own father...The dialogs were written and performed to perfection, the breathtaking beauty of the Wyoming scenery, the subtle and powerful music, complemented this great story...I have to confess, the shirt scene at the end of the movie in Jacks room was the detail that made me loose the ""cool"" I was trying so hard to keep throughout the movie... It's an awesome movie... Jake and Heath, you guys rock.",Brokeback Mountain

Heath Ledger's performance is breath taking and definitely worthy of an Oscar and every other award imaginable. The movie should be on everyone's Top Ten List and deserves to be Number One in my book. There are not many movies that haunt you for days afterward but this one has been in my mind ever since I saw it 10 days ago. I am sure I will see it another 3 or 4 times before it leaves the theaters and each time I will take different people I care about to show them what a masterpiece this movie is. A movie for the ages!!!!,Brokeback Mountain
1980,rfp_737,"Brokeback Mountain -- good, but a tad too long",7,8 January 2006,"It seems that after reading the reviews of this movie, that I am the only one, besides my two friends who saw this movie today, who was not blown away by this movie. While the acting was fantastic (Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams in particular) and the cinematography was breathtaking, the movie dragged in places. I do think that the movie is haunting in it's imagery and also in the heartbreaking forbidden love between the two main characters, but should this movie take home a best picture Oscar? I honestly don't think so. I do think that Heath Ledger and Michelle Williams should win awards for their performances --especially Heath Ledger. Locally and nationally, there has been a lot of press regarding the ""Gay Cowboy Movie"" and I want to note that my Luke warm reception of the movie is not based on any homosexual phobias whatsoever. I, and the two friends I saw the movie with, are women in our early 40's who are about as open minded as you can possibly get. We all walked away from this movie with the same ""what's the fuss all about?"" look on our faces. Still, it's a good movie, beautifully shot and acted, but, in my opinion, not worthy of the high praise that it has received.",Brokeback Mountain

Never have I ever cried this much when watching a movie... This movie really touched my heart and soul! I really felt the powerful love between the two guys and it was so beautiful yet heart wrenching! The love transcends gender and sexuality and everyone can relate to it and understand it. The movie truly spoke to me.. it really reflected how life is for gay men living in places where homosexuality is still outlawed.. places like India, for example, where gay men are pressured by society to get married and live closeted lives, unable to be themselves... It is so sad. We need more movies like these that educate people and broaden minds. Kudos to Ang Lee!",Brokeback Mountain
1983,malleyok,Lyrical and moving meditation on love,10,10 January 2006,"Saw Brokeback Mountain, loved it, saw it again and loved it more.My favourite review quote is: You either buy into this tale of men in love or you join the ranks of those who've been snickering during the movie's prerelease trailers, and who can be divided into the insecure, the idiots, or the insecure idiots. My take: it's not queering the western, it's queering the hyper-masculinity of modern American red neck mores, with their hunting and fishing trips, 10 gallon hats and kinky boots. And at the same time, it is a universal meditation on the impact and ripples of love on our lives and those we're connected to, both wondrous and destructive.",Brokeback Mountain
1984,katja-35,Broke my heart!,10,1 February 2006,"When I read the short story many years ago, it completely broke my heart and so I was tremendously excited to hear that Ang Lee had made a film. I hoped desperately that they would do the story justice and I was overjoyed to discover they excelled themselves in the translation from book to film.I don't believe I have ever seen two actors get the sexual tension, love and chemistry as completely as Heath and Jake and this includes male/female on screen couples. The label of 'gay cowboy movie' is absolutely outrageous as this film is about all consuming love between two people which is so confused and pure and doesn't deserve to be compartmentalised in that way.I am delighted to say it completely broke my heart again. Congratulations on a wonderful film.",Brokeback Mountain
1985,pjhowell-1,Great movie,10,9 January 2006,"'Brokeback Mountain' is a great movie. The actors did their jobs so superbly that I forgot they're actors and totally believed them as the people they portrayed. They all turned in Oscar worthy performances. Jack and Ennis' love for each other, though never verbalized with the three magic words, was obvious, and the heartbreak at the end was obvious as well.The scenery was gorgeous. I didn't get the chance to see where the movie was filmed, but the wide open spaces of what's supposed to be Wyoming were magnificent. I've never had the opportunity to travel out west and, like most people born in the eastern U.S., I measure ""wide open"" only by a few hundred clear-cut acres. The big screen filled with rolling foothills and a tiny little matchbook-sized car running along the bottom of screen showed just how wide and open the ""wide open"" west really is.Closed-minded and homophobic people should not see this movie. Of course, they won't enjoy it and the subject will only give them more fodder for their small-minded prattle. Gays, lesbians, and G/L-friendly folks will enjoy it immensely. SPOILER: Do not read further if you haven't seen the movie: The heartbreak of Jack and Ennis' love that cannot be lived to its fullest is achingly real. Unfortunately, so is Jack's horrible death in all too common manner in today's world.See the movie. It's worth it.",Brokeback Mountain
1986,enners20,One word for this film..........................WOW!,10,9 January 2006,"I have been waiting for months to see this film - and boy was it worth it!! An AMAZING performance by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal (the most beautiful man ever), and also for Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway doing their part - what an amazing transition for them!! its just a beautiful LOVE story - no matter what sexuality they are! It was SO frustrating to watch in some parts as all you want is for them to be together and for Ennis Del Mar, Heaths character, to wake up and realise that being with jack Twist, Jakes character is what he should do - but he cant due to everything that has happened in his life. I was a bit gutted that neither of them say 'I love You' to each other. But they didn't have to, as the passion in their relationship was obvious. The film makes you think a lot too, about how parts of the film go, and about life, love and relationships in general - an Oscar winner!. CAN NOT wait for the DVD!!!!",Brokeback Mountain

It gives you something to think about and a look that the world today has change. As a gay man it really made me feel proud to be who I'am. I really recommend it, I think this is a film everyone should see, to truly understand how gay people feel. Very touching. It was a beautiful film and the music was great. Both the actors are wonderful and hot so the film was just amazing, they both gave wonderful acts. This movie really made me like Jake hes such an great actor.

1991,bersingssongs,I can't get it out of my head...,10,9 January 2006,"I read an earlier thread that summed up how I have been since viewing BBM. I can't get it out of my mind. It's like some kind of pull. I feel like two of my friends went through what Ennis and Jack went through. Heath and Jake were phenomenal actors, portraying joy, disappointment, love, lust (Wow! Intense!), and heartbreak. Their facial expressions alone revealed the emotional track we were taken on throughout. I agree this story is a story of unfulfilled love, not just a homosexual encounter. It also deals with extramarital affairs. Something I haven't read yet, is the seemingly intuitive sense Alma Jr. had about her Dad's (Ennis') conflict. Never underestimate a daughter's understanding of her father's heart, much like a child of God has insight into the Heavenly Father's heart; the bond between father and daughter. I think we saw way into Ennis' anguish looking into Alma Jr's eyes. And what was up with the line, ""Girls don't fall in love with fun."" If we don't, we're probably falling in love with a guy who needs a lot of fixin' up and shouldn't hound him, but let him have his space. Ennis sure needed more of that, than an over-eager waitress in his life. Although her presence probably helped him fit into society better. I wanted Jack and Ennis to move to New York, where they could live a happy, gay life without the ending they had...anyone tell me how I can get BBM out of my head!?!?!?! I guess I'll go see it again! heehee",Brokeback Mountain
1992,wgskiteam06,Most powerful movie I've ever seen,10,10 January 2006,"Ang Lee's brilliant and haunting love story instantly became my favorite movie after i saw it. It's power and sadness stayed with me for over a week. He actually improves upon the original short story- extending the story line and strengthening the characters. The performances were all great, but Heath Ledger's portrayal of Ennis Del Mar is one of the most powerful and nuanced performances of recent cinematic history. His acting skill moves beyond the sparse dialog. The real pain is evident in the silent scenes, where Ennis's inability to change the course of his life breaks the hearts of the audience. His character is not only identifiable to gay men, to to any person whose dreams have been a casualty of the world: gay, straight, male, female, red state, blue state. The film's few flaws (the almost too censured love scenes, the emphasis on their family life over their relationship) are instantly forgivable and forgettable upon the emotional force of the last quarter of the movie. Brokeback Mountain is the reason the 5 star review exists. Every movie I've ever seen pales in comparison.",Brokeback Mountain
1993,keirwood,Don't' Forget Jack Twist and Jake Glyllenhaal,10,9 January 2006,"I've seen this movie twice and the emotions brought about by the film and what it represents have lingered with me all day. This commentary is laden with spoilers, so read at your own risk.The more I've thought about the film *spoiler coming up*, the more I realize that Jack Twist, played by Jake Glyllenhaal, is, in my opinion, the more tragic of the two characters. This is not simply because of his fate in the film, but pay close attention to his character development through to the closing scene and you will notice that Jack was the character with the heart, the longing, the willingness to sacrifice and the dream. Granted, this movie is about Ennis Del Mar, who Heath Ledger literally BECAME, but Heath's incredible screen presence and believability may overshadow the very endearing and desperate qualities of Jake's Jack Twist.Case in point, when Ennis visits Jack's parents' home, Jack, though he did not come from a broken home, was from a desolate place, bereft of true appreciation and his father's respect was colder than the winter chill on Brokeback Mountain. You can feel the void in Jack during his final, dramatic scene at the river. Jack never quite earns anyone's full respect until *spoiler* the very end, when Ennis realizes how much he loved him. Jack's parents, his employers, in-laws, his wife,and fellow rodeo cowboys offer up more scrutiny and contempt than love for him. It makes you pity him because Jake's Jack Twist was so flat out adorable, from his clumsiness, his flaws, and his congeniality, that you hope he finds true love. You forget that he is cheating on his wife child with other men and root him on! Finally, *BIG spoiler* if Jack Twist died in the manner that Ennis envisions, then the movie is perhaps one of the most devastating I've seen. Mr. Glyllenhaal's Jack Twist was the character I empathized with the most, though I feel Ennis' conflict, his emptiness, and regret. It's mostly because he found the one thing we all seek in life, true love, but his fear kept him from taking the risk and giving himself wholly to it.What a great performance and what a compelling love interest. If I could find a dreamer like Jack, male or female, I would hold on to that person. How about a best supporting actor nomination for Jake Glyllenhaal?",Brokeback Mountain

Especially in this time we live, where there is so much understanding and acceptance yet so much hatred, bigotry and prejudice. I am so grateful to these actors, the writers, the director and producers for having the courage to bring this film to the masses and not to shy away from the subject matter, there is no cheating or shortcuts found in this film that could alter a generation's understanding of love and what it means to cherish.

I sure miss the Jacks in my life.Like Annie said ""If you can't fix it, stand it""! But Damn, I find myself driving the freeway home at night thinking of those Jacks and of course my youth. I get mad and turn the radio up because I can't remember several events and the order they fit into.And then this movie made me find my best friend from 1963. He refused to come to my wedding 30 years ago because I was choosing the straight life and he was 100% gay. He wished me well and we knew that we would still be friends. I was to late, he died in 2003 from Aids related cancer at age 58. My God! He was a beautiful Jack and full of life. I cry on the freeway some nights now. That has never happened to me. And when I went to see the movie again, I stopped because I just can't let the compulsion drive me to despair again.

1996,kpobrien-1,worth the 2 hr drive to see,10,10 January 2006,"You've read it before, and I'll say it again with ENTHUSIASM, this is NOT a movie about gay cowboys, it's about love, in all its manifestations. There is something every single adult can relate to on some level. There are REAL human emotions infused throughout every frame of this film --- not just in the plot, but the cinematography, the music, the sound, everything. The acting never once feels like acting. This is as close to a perfect movie as I've seen in a long time. I question the emotional depth of any person who sees this movie and didn't get completely absorbed, moved and affected by it. I could not wait to see this film. It is only playing at one theater within 50 miles. It took about 2 hours and 20 minutes to get there. I waited for two hours more to get the next show available that was not sold out. This movie stayed with me and haunted me about my experience that I had shared with people who are no longer part of my like. You can take this situation and apply it to your own lives.... You won't regret it.",Brokeback Mountain
1997,mrbluzietti,"I was silenced, but now must speak out!",10,10 January 2006,"After the movie was over, I just wanted to go home and be alone. Heath and Jake silenced me. They pulled at every emotional cord that I have. I left the theater wanting to weep for both characters. Besides the love story, ""Brokeback Mountain"" also showed how close-mindedness affects more than just those who are discriminated. It's arguable that society's pressures to marry and raise families caused just as much grief for the wives in the film as the cowboys themselves. And the setting...breathtaking! Yes! This movie will remain with me forever. I often tell people that a movie isn't worth the price of the ticket. For ""Brokeback Mountain"", however, go buy five tickets! I will definitely go and see this film again before it goes off the silver screen. I'm also hoping to buy the book tonight. I only hope that the pain and sadness I've felt these last two days will wane over time. There was something so beautiful, yet sad and lonely, about the semi-routine ""fishing trips"" that Ennis and Jack take. Unfortunately, for some of us, whether gay or straight, we've lived such romances. Perhaps this is one reason why so many people are so deeply touched by the film.I wish to also thank the cast and crew for finally portraying gay men in a light different from the routine stereotypes that we see. I wonder if Heath and Jake really know what a mark they've left in American cinema. Thanks guys! It meant a lot to me and I'm sure it will mean a lot to anyone who is struggling with their sexuality.

Go with open minds and you will sink through the surface and then see the quality of it.

None of you need me to tell you how good this movie is, leave that to Roger Ebert. But what is particularly disconcerting to me is the extreme polar ""user reviews"" of this film. The great ones are based generally on the quality of story, emotional investment, and overall excellent film-making. The negative ones are almost always those of the conservative religious right, expressing their opinions of how Hollywood wishes to ""corrupt their children"" by ""promoting homosexuality"" to the masses. This, according to them, is ""a movie with an agenda."" Since when is a movie review based on someone's religious convictions? Everyone is certainly entitled to their own opinion's, but lets save the preaching for church. I get particularly angry when these very same individuals who have such a vehement problem with Brokeback Mountain seem to have far less of a problem with action films filled with gratuitous violence and murder. I guess in their minds two people in love is a far greater atrocity than murder. It makes me immensely sad that a great majority of society feels this way, but it is the world that we live in. I hope that within my lifetime a movie like Brokeback can be seen by all for what it really is: an epic love story; one that reaches past the boundaries of time, challenge, and sexual orientation...My Essay Regarding the Effects of this Film...Anthony Lane of the New Yorker magazine calls Brokeback Mountain a ""slow and stoic movie, hailed as a gay Western, (which) feels neither gay nor especially Western: (rather) it is a study of love under siege."" I could probably spend hours and write pages as to why Brokeback is probably the best movie of the year, and now one of my favorite films, but you can read the praise from every major film critic in the industry. But rather, I feel compelled to write an essay regarding the effects this film is having on us. And not just us who live in Manhattan or Hollywood, but instead, and probably more importantly, the effect this film has on the scared kid in Evanston, Wyoming or the homophobic middle aged man in Evansville, Indiana.For the first time in my life, and perhaps the first time in history, a story about two men in love has embraced our society. And I say ""love"" without apology or prefacing it with ""gay,"" because that is what is not what is seen in this film. And although cowboys and homosexuality are certainly parts of Brokeback, what is taken from it is two people desperately and tragically in love.I have now seen this movie twice, the first time to see it and feel it, and the second time to really embrace it and be moved by it. The first time I saw it in Chelsea the night it was released in limited markets, and of course it was received with praise (the entire audience was gay), but the second time I saw it, I deliberately went to a theatre in a predominately ""straight"" part of town on the Upper West Side. I wanted to see the reactions of the straight couples and people young and old of all predispositions. I found myself spending as much time looking at the audience as I did at the screen. I also found myself getting anxious in parts that were strongly sexual or romantic between the two men. I feared that audiences in 2005 were still not yet ready to accept two men together. I feared that the story would be rejected, not because of the content, but rather the gender of the subjects. (Rejection in this way I felt somehow rejects me personally as a gay man.) Yet what I saw not only surprised me, but moved me. Albeit a walkout or two, and some odd wide eyed looks from the straight man dragged along by his girlfriend; there was not one snicker, not one offensive remark, not one bit of laughter. To the other extreme, I saw straight men in their 80's sniffle, the man with his girlfriend tear up at moments. I thought to myself, my God, look at where we have come. A film where gay men are not the sexless beings of the past or overdone caricatures of themselves like Jack McFarland from Will and Grace, but finally one with characters who are real, sexual, emotional, threatening even, and still accepted by every person in those seats.I think back to the days when I was a kid and Reagan was president. The days when gays were only known by their stereotypes or later their ""gay cancer."" And just 20 years later gay is not just okay, in some circles it is cool to have the token gay friend. I'm not naive enough to believe that one movie can change the world, or too soon to forget that just 7 years ago 21 year old Matthew Shepard was beaten to death in the very same state as the love affair in Brokeback is set in. But the numbers tell all. ""Ang Lee's multi-Golden Globe nominated feature ""Brokeback Mountain,"" starring Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal ponied up a heap of cash over the weekend, spectacularly bursting the six-figure average threshold. The critically lauded film grossed $547,425 from just five screens in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, averaging a whopping $109,485, the biggest screen average.."" (IndieWire:Biz) People, and not just gay people are seeing, some for the first time, two men in love in a positive light. Eyes are opening and hearts are changing, and I can say for the first time in a very long time, that I see light at the end of the tunnel and have hope for things to come.",Brokeback Mountain
2000,cute_loopy,wow,10,11 January 2006,"absolutely the most incredible film because of everything about it. the story its telling, the amazing cinematography, the amazing acting, the messages it gives off, the soundtrack, the things it makes you think about...i have never been affected by a film like i was with this. half an hour after leaving the cinema i was talking about it with my friend and we both just burst into tears. 2 days later now and I'm still thinking about it every second of my day! It will stick with you forever!you have to see this film. but if you're a guy you have to be so open-minded about it. even if they're not at all homophobic, i know some guys who didn't enjoy it just because they found it a tiny bit uncomfortable, so they shut themselves off a bit. you really have to throw yourself into their story...if you do, i hope you'll appreciate this film like i did....wow!",Brokeback Mountain
2001,swtill,Amazing,10,15 January 2006,"Amazing, awesome, incredible...the words to describe this landmark in film making could go on forever. Ang Lee has created a masterpiece filled with tenderness, compassion, sweeping landscapes, everything anyone could want from a film of this caliber. If this movie doesn't walk away with best picture on March 5th, it would be a scandal and there should be a recount! I have never left a movie and had it be on my mind for more than an afternoon or evening. This movie has stayed with me for over 2 weeks, and I had to see it again, and it was even better the 2nd time. Please see this film, and keep an open mind about love, and the right we all deserve to be happy. As written, Heath gives the performance of his life as a torn cowboy helpless to his most inner desires. Jake deserves the same accolades as the supporting actor also much deserving of a trophy from the academy. Go see this movie and tell your friends.",Brokeback Mountain
2002,SouthernBlueEyes,The movie that haunts me still...,10,13 January 2006,"Frankly, I wasn't thrilled when my friends suggested we all go see ""Brokeback Mountain"". It just didn't seem to be a movie I'd enjoy, but when the group votes, you go along & ultimately enjoy the fellowship if not the film.""Brokeback Mountain"", however, caught me totally off-guard. Here is a story, and what a story it is! The characters are REAL, the story is well crafted and tears at the heart, the scenery is breathtaking ... and the actors deliver remarkable and unforgettable performances.In particular, Heath Ledger is wonderful as the cowboy who struggles to deal with his feelings. But also, Roberta Maxwell is unforgettable ... those few minutes on screen and her delivery of the dialog is absolutely amazing ... in my opinion, she deserves a best supporting actress Oscar, for she truly ""got it"" with her interpretation of Jack's mother.The movie has haunted me ever since I saw it a week ago, and I've spent the time since selling it to my friends and family. Everyone needs to see this movie, with open heart and mind. Why can't I forget it? Why does hearing the music even bring tears to my eyes? My grandmother had a photo album of images from her childhood through her old age ... in it was a picture of a tall, handsome man in a dark suit. I remember as a child asking, ""Grandma who is that man?"" Her expression changed from joy to sorrow ... ""That is Nick Carpenter, my first boyfriend,"" she replied. ""He died in the first world war."" She watched that snapshot fade for over 60 years.Also a great aunt, Elizabeth, in her old age when her body and her mind were failing, would arise each morning, get dressed in her finest dress, and sit by the front window, waiting for a man. While family record does not preserve the name of this man, we know he was not my Uncle David.Perhaps that is the haunting appeal of ""Brokeback Mountain""; perhaps it's the memory of a lost love in our own life that, for whatever reason, never worked out -- and the sad recollections of what might have been, which are oftentimes far more moving than mourning what actually was.",Brokeback Mountain
2003,wacadou,probably the most moving movie of a lifetime,10,11 January 2006,"If you choose to not see this movie you probably should reconsider your ability to have an open-mind. The movie is not about the gay sex, it's about a forbidden love that in the time period of when it happens there is no way that they (Ennis and Jake) can ever make it happen without jeopardizing there lives and the lives of the people they care about. The movie leaves you emotionally drained and feeling there pain especially if you have ever been in their position, either straight or gay. Heath and Jake are obviously two heterosexual male actors whom let their abilities to act shin throw, If they had any hang-ups about playing the characters it was not visible on the screen. Thank you to them and Ang Lee for giving America the most Beautiful love story since the original LOVE STORY with Ryan O'Neal and Ali McGraw.",Brokeback Mountain
2004,Concertgebouw,"Rapturous elation, camaraderie; inconsolable grief & loneliness; a remarkable achievement",10,15 January 2006,"This is the second time I had seen the movie in three days. I see few movies and quickly forget nearly all of them. Perhaps a detail or two, a character or perhaps a theme of a plot that pleased me will remain for weeks, months, or even years. However, this western love story was so supremely acted, the beautiful cinematography of Alberta's wild country and its rustic towns so appropriate, Ang Lee's superb direction, and the wizardry of the casting of the two principals, as well as all minor roles, that it was a revelation to me. The screenplay sounds natural, its rhythm correct for the period of time portrayed. The musical score was quite spare and restrained and appropriate to the film's 'feel.' Another plus, although I had not read this 30-page short story masterpiece, was its faithful adaptation to the big screen. All these elements combined to make this sensitive and marvelous and tragic love story a remarkable cinematic event, in my opinion. Fast forward to the Golden Globe awards: I am delighted that it has thus far garnered four Golden Globes for direction, screenplay, individual song, and best picture. The last 12-15 minutes, beginning with the receipt of the final postcard just overwhelmed. The poignancy of what followed built to a to shattering climax as Ennis caresses the articles of clothing of Jack Twist. The complete sense of emotional desolation and isolation, of inconsolable grief and loneliness, of possessing no Kodaks to keep sharp the memory of his Jack Twist is tragic. And as the closet door is closed and the scene fades, the depth of Ennis' loss and a life of loneliness which awaits is further intensified beyond the breaking point. I shall welcome the passage of time when the tsunami of emotions created by author Annie Proulx, captured by director Ang Lee and the superb duo of screenwriters, and the inspired acting of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal recedes to 98.6.For me, yearning for an alternate ending in which artistic integrity and emotional calmness fuses convincingly is inescapable, however futile. See this movie, it is tremendously moving. As others have predicted, I, too, think it destined to become a cinematic milestone.",Brokeback Mountain
2005,Mokimbo,Brokeback got me good too!,10,14 January 2006,"The words to describe this movie don't come easily. In 43 years of movie viewing I've never had images from film affect me in this way. Five days after the viewing and I am still mulling it over and marveling at this bit of magic from Tinseltown. I want to credit Ang Lee for his genius, all the actors for their superb performances, and Larrry McMurtry and Diana Ossana for their guided vision, but this beautiful story belongs to Annie Proulx. Without it and it would be just another film. This is one of those rare occasions in film-making when everything comes together. Talented people recognize quality source material when they see it, and feel compelled to equal it with their own particular craft. This is what film-making is all about!",Brokeback Mountain
2006,ida1969,Wonderful,10,11 January 2006,"This film is absolutely out of this world. As a number of other posters have commented, it stays with you for days afterwards. I urge everyone to see it as soon as possible.Its unfortunate that some will be put off by its subject matter, but they will be the ones who will miss out. As it happens, it really doesn't matter who the central relationship is between, as the themes it explores can and have affected each and every one of us. Having said that, this is the most honest portrayal of homosexual love ever seen in a Hollywood film. For that reason, this is probably one of the most important films to come out of Hollywood for many years. It obviously took some courage on behalf of the filmmakers and actors to commit this story to film, but the world is a better place for them having done so. I would like to thank everyone involved in the making of this film for having the courage and commitment to produce such an amazing piece of entertainment.Please see this film, and lets hope we hear a lot more about it at Oscar time!",Brokeback Mountain
2007,heights1963,Very moving!,10,11 January 2006,"I had to give the film a ""10"", but it is truly not my type of film, it has moments that to me were gut wrenching. Definitely not a happily ever after film type of film, it was incredibly well done, the casting the cinematography, the performances. It has not been 24 hours yet since I have seen the film and I cannot get Heath Ledgers ""Ennis"" characters last scene out of my mind. This film is about love and the power of it, it does not glorify it so much as it depicts it in very compelling way. The film does not candy coat anything, the sex scenes are modest, no significant amounts of nudity. This film is about love and its endurance, again heartbreaking and gut wrenching. If you are sensitive and compassionate then bring some Kleenexes because the tears will flow.",Brokeback Mountain
2008,roach_band,Brokeback Mountain was Gay,1,11 January 2006,"And when I say gay, I mean the way a fifth grader would say gay. I want my 8 dollars and two hours back. I think that this movie might be the most over hyped movie since the Passion of the Christ. This move was supposed to be a gay love story, it was anything but. Don't worry, if you're not mature enough to handle a little guy on guy smooching, there really is nothing to worry about. I 'm personally not bothered by it, and I wasn't at all moved by the ""gay"" scene that more resembled the infamous Deliverance rape scene then anything else. Apart from a few snuggles and kisses, there is little ""gayness"" in this movie. This movie dragged and dragged. It also had many untimely fades that made you think the movie was ending, (or made you wish that it was.) The actors did a great job portraying western cowboys, and by great job I mean that they mumbled throughout the entire movie like they had crap in their mouth. You know when you watch Snatch, or any other European film with thick accents, and it takes a good five minutes to learn how to decipher what their saying. Well I missed 2/3d's of the dialog in this movie because I couldn't' understand what they were saying. I've been around people from Louisiana, and trust me if there's a southern accent that's tough to figure out, that's the one. But after two hours I literally couldn't hear what they were saying. The dialog I did hear was stunted and stale. I'm still trying to figure out the ""Love Story"" that it was hyped up to be, it's really a story about infidelity and the fear of getting your ass kicked. I will say this, I think Heath Ledger was awful! The main characteristic of his character was not talking. He had one maybe two scenes where he actually ""acted,"" however the rest of the movie he kind of just moped. This movie also takes a perfectly good looking girl and makes her ugly, (chick from Dawson's Creek) so I'm sure she'll be up for an Oscar. I will also say that the Dawson's Creek girl was pretty good and what little screen time she did have, she impacted the scene; however she had so little screen time that she may not win even in a supporting role. I found that the music was lacking pace. There was too little at points, and when they did have music it was misplaced. It's one thing to have themes in a movie, but I didn't follow the musical theme in this one, even thought I enjoyed music. This really isn't anything special, unfortunately it's being touted as an epic in film making achievement, because a couple of straight men that are in the peak of their career decided to play a gay character. Is that really even a big deal in 2005-6? One high point is the movie had breathtaking shots. Over all this movie was garbage. If you're a movie fan and watch the Oscars, go see the movie so you can have an honest opinion like mine. If you're looking for a good movie to see on a night out, go see something else.",Brokeback Mountain
2009,Andrew-1205,Nothing makes me cry - except this film,10,11 January 2006,"A film that really brings to light the torture thousands of men that were (and still are) put through the repression of an everyday assumptious society. A film that really brings to light a true love that shines through every layer of grey that society throws at it.Ennis's character totally overwhelms me with its honesty and portrayal of somebody locked in an emotional cage. Prodded back into the cage with just everyday comments and assumptions that he has to contend with. Terrified someone will find out his true feelings, nothing ever comes out expect occasional outbursts of rage and fights with his own feelings.Jack's character does not seem to have such a strict cage around it. He is more expressive and seems to be less wary about what others may think. He tries to prise Ennis's cage open 'it's alright' he says, just to have it slammed shut again by anxieties created within him by everyday society. Ennis's character is extremely quiet and unable to express myself through fear. This film did something dramatic to me, it made me cry. Last time I cried was over 2 years ago from a family death. Films just don't bring me anywhere close to tears.This is more than a film though, it is a true look into the eyes of thousands of men around the world. A look that their characters cannot express so we'll let this film do it for them . .",Brokeback Mountain
2010,followtheleader04,amazing,10,12 February 2006,"This movie didn't wow me completely until I went home and found myself thinking about it later. An amazing achievement in cinema, especially in the performances. This proves that amazing effects and cheap laughs aren't the only attributes that Hollywood recognizes anymore and it's great to see that two people can have a gay relationship without being the total metro stereotype of gay. The acting of the two wives goes largely underrated, as Michelle Williams especially becomes a cornerstone of the storytelling. Jack Twist and Ennis Delmar should go down as two unforgettable people in movie lore. The powerful ending really suggests what could have been and leaves you thinking. It sort of yearns for a sequel that could never come, (and shouldn't come as it would really be a disservice to this film). The only thing i can think to do now is to watch it again, and notice all the clues to what is about to happen. Some may say it's overrated or perhaps morally wrong, but I doubt they saw what I saw- which was a film of amazing quality all around. I also doubt they saw the impact of it in the theater I was in, with more than a few adults in tears near the end.",Brokeback Mountain
2011,rattlesomecages,Brokeback will haunt you and take you on a journey,10,11 January 2006,"EMOTIONS: This movie touched me, made me mad, stomped on my heart and then made me realize that I love life and all of life's quirks. Get ready to be taken somewhere that your heart might never have been, or back to somewhere that it has.SEX SCENES: At first I thought that the first sex scene was too rough and realistic for my tender peepers LOL but a few days later I realized that these are rough and tumble guys and they wanted what they wanted and get the heck out of the way ;).CONNECTION TO THE CHARACTERS: There are moments in the film that your heart will belong to Jack and Ennis and there are moments that your heart will belong to Alma. Michelle Williams was amazing in this movie and or course she did not deserve to be left out of Ennis's life but she went on to love the new guy in her life. YOU WILL MAKE A CONNECTION WITH At least ONE OF THE CHARACTERS, I PROMISE JACK: Here is a loving cuddly guy that at moments can take your breath away with his handsome face and his hot body. He wants to be happy in life but he screws it up by taking the easy road and getting married. Obviously he is BI and he has the hots for this lovely girl. He made some mistakes but have'nt YOU made mistakes on your way to trying to be happy.. come on, lets be honest here. Jack is a free spirit and for what its worth you will never like everything about a person so you focus on the good. He had more good that bad. You'll see.ENNIS: Ennis, I fell in love with Ennis !!!He is a man that holds everything inside but man what he's hiding is unconditional love. He was mentally tortured by his father and he was emotionally setup for a life of ""yes"" and ""no"". BUT Ennis loved Jack from a deep place inside him, more than Jack ever loved him. When Ennis let Jack leave that first summer and then he fell to his knees in total despair... you could hear my heart crack in two pieces. When he held the ""shirts"", my heart broke into 100 more pieces. When he was with his daughter my heart melted because of the love he showed those kids (keeping in mind that dads in those days were much less involved in their kids lives than today). When he was eating his pie in the restaurant I wanted to hug him and tell him that it is possible to be happy. If you can watch this movie without thinking that Ennis was a good man then you and I have a different idea from you on what makes a man (mistakes and all lol).ALMA: Great job and she made my heart break watching her be the one who gets the poor end of the deal.SEE THIS MOVIE: See this movie even if its just to say that you saw it. It will be a long time before the movie comes out on video because of the slow release. See it so that you might take a look at what happened to these guys. I promise you that you will learn something from this movie. It may not be what I learned but you will learn something. Oh and you won't leave the theater gay... (unless you went in gay) lol WILL THIS REVIEW EVER END?: Jeezzz, I'm a big mouth tonight. To all the kind people who took the time to read all this I thank you. PUT SOME LOVE OUT INTO THE WORLD and take someone you love to watch the movie with you because when it hits you the next day (people who have seen already know what I'm talking about) you will need someone to talk with about Jack & Ennis & Alma.FINAL WORD IS FOR THE BIGGOTS: From the bottom of my heart I hope that in your lifetime you will become a men and lose the fear. Become a better person. There is someone behind that fear and I'll bet it's someone worth knowing. PEACE",Brokeback Mountain
2012,bearashcan,Brokeback Mountain Is Our Mount Olympus,10,11 January 2006,"I have seen ""Brokeback"" several times now. I plan to see it many more. Each time I notice something I hadn't noticed previously. What I have noticed chiefly, though, is the profound influence it is having on my life. I do not think anything -- book, film, play, therapy or person -- has had such an effect on me in the last several decades. For the first time in my life, I have understood what a catharsis really is. I mean I studied the Greeks in college, learning all about Oedipus, Medea, etc. I could probably write eloquently on the subject if I put my mind to it. But I think this was the first time in my life that I ever underwent one. After the second viewing, when I had returned home, I was just about to turn on the computer, when all of a sudden a tender scene between Ennis and Jake came into mind. I begun to convulse so violently, I couldn't breathe. After I began gasping for air, I started to sob. I cried so hard and for so long I thought it wouldn't stop. I became alarmed. I had never felt such emotional agony. It was as if a lifetime of pain -- longing, the loss of loved ones, fear, self-doubt, failed romances, goals not met and regrets for a squandered youth -- suddenly rose to the surface. After much effort, I was able to calm down. The next day, I felt as if a huge weight had lifted. In some ways, I felt reborn. Ready like Ennis, perhaps, to change. Such is the power of ""Brokeback Mountain."" It is on the highest level of the great tragedies.

On second (and subsequent) viewing(s), one starts noticing all the rest: the symbolism of names, colors, objects; the precise lighting, framing, and timing of each scene; the many allusions to classic tales of love and loss; the growing sense that every detail in this movie is meaningful; the realization that every choice made in the making of this movie contributes to a seamless, perfect whole.This is an important piece of film-making...one that will be studied in cinema classes for years to come...Go, watch, and enjoy...at any level you choose...",Brokeback Mountain

2015,mickey_london,This film may change your life,10,12 January 2006,"I had been expecting this film for a while, with plenty of rumours surrounding its making and its release. My first expectation was one of mild titillation  a gay-themed movie with good-looking actors and a Hollywood budget, how far would they go, etc When the film opened in the US, I looked at the website reviews and it dawned on me that this was going to be a very different, rather more serious experience.This is the mood in which I entered the cinema last week when I first saw it. Despite being 48 and having a reserved, introvert demeanour, I can shed the odd tear at a good movie. So I came with the proverbial box of tissues. I thought I was prepared. Well, how wrong I was. After maybe half an hour, having been drawn slowly into the film starting with the unforgettable score, I began to feel as Ennis does at one point in the film, as if my guts were slowly being drawn out by the yard. The last fifteen minutes pushed the pain and the sadness to a nearly unbearable point. I left the cinema in tears and tried to regain my composure at home, to no avail. This is now the fifth day, and I have been haunted by this film ever since. It has already cost me several sleepless nights, with the characters and the scenes constantly rushing through my head. I had not had this reaction to a film since I was a rather depressive and sensitive teenager struggling with a growing awareness of his homosexuality. And then again, the reaction had never been so strong.The day after I first saw the film, I bought the novel and read it in one go (it's very short and only takes about an hour). This definitely helps understanding the film, although I think the movie transcends the novel by a long way. By then, I felt I just had to see the film again the next day. On the second viewing, a lot of things clicked in the film that I had not appreciated before. A few details that had grated me on first viewing now fell into place and it felt as if nothing could be changed to the film. This time, I was just about overwhelmed - I cried my heart out again, even more so than the first time. I am now convinced this is an absolute masterpiece, and the film is right up there in my top ten favourites. I have been thinking a lot as to why this film struck such a chord at this point in my life. After all little if anything of it is relevant to my life  my own experiences could not be more remote than that of farmhands in Wyoming. The first explanation is of course about the shared experiences with anyone who has grown up gay (especially so thirty years ago)  the longing, the repressed feelings that cannot be articulated or aired, the dead-end situations, the secrets, the isolation and self-hate in an homophobic environment. But the film has a much greater significance and relevance, and eventually connects to all human experience: the overriding importance of love and relationships, the memories of grief and personal losses, the heartaches we have all experienced, the sense of time that goes away and will never come back, the sadness of lost opportunities, the endless quest for a better life, the dangers of holding back from more fulfilling alternatives in life, of not making commitments where one's heart lies but taking refuge in a humdrum existence that proves ultimately unsatisfactory whilst time ebbs inexorably away. So it is indeed, deep down, relevant to all of us. What can I say about the actors, the score and the direction that has not already been said better elsewhere? Outstanding sounds too feeble. If Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were to spend the rest of their (hopefully) long careers sticking to commercial trivia, movie history will forever remember them for the extraordinary performances they give here. Ledger's grunts and Gyllenhaal's longing, beautiful eyes say infinitely more than can ever be put in a script.You can find flaws in the film if you look for them. It could be another hour longer to develop the characters more fully in the second half, spanning twenty years. The film could show more intimate affection between Jack and Ennis (which I would find more satisfactory as a gay man). But enough ifs and buts. The emotional charge in the film is intense as it is, and it is what counts. So, I have to give a ten.Who cares if this film does or does not reap Oscars? No doubt there have been other outstanding performances at the movies this year, all worthy of rewards. But only a handful of films have ever transcended their medium and their theme to become great works of art connecting to the universal human condition. This is one of the few, and this is worth very much more than any award bestowed by the critics.I had to write this review, my first ever, to get this film out of my system and get on with my life. I can only say one thing. Go and see it. At all costs. You will come back emotionally drained, but ultimately a better person. Trust me.",Brokeback Mountain
2016,justforfunca,Masterpiece!,10,12 January 2006,"I don't know if anyone will ever be able to top this film in the gay genre. It managed to do the hardest thing imaginable and that is portray two main characters as believable, truly homosexual men, and yet have you quickly disregard this fact as secondary in importance throughout the film.I think that is what got me in the gut more than anything else in the film and that is not cheap praise because the scenery, the talent of the two leads, the supporting cast, the tightness of the plot and the mastery of skirting relatively sparse locations and simplistic scenes while keeping them riveting are also excellent accomplishments of this movie.It's been haunting me for days and I may have to go back and see it again in the theater and hopefully release its hold on me. You know those movies that just made you believe the characters were real and you can't stop thinking about their ""life""? This managed to do it.I humbly bow to the director, Ang Lee. You have truly wowed me. If I never see another film of yours I'll have seen the best you can achieve because you couldn't have improved on this in any way. Perfection.",Brokeback Mountain

It has the potential to touch people, and move them to a place of understanding, of tolerance. Brokeback Mountain gave me a glimpse of what my life could have been.

I am thankful to have shared in Ennis and Jack's tragic tale, for it has encouraged me to better appreciate my own story. It was comforting to witness, even though it was for a short time, Ennis and Jack had found each other, held one another tender and tight, and moved a little closer to Heaven above. I like to think that somewhere up there, Ennis and Jack are with each otherand those two cowboys, together, finally have the ranch of their dreams.(For My Full Review, go to Brokebackmountain.com, under Ran in AZ)",Brokeback Mountain
2018,lvwmprovost,Changed me forever!,10,12 January 2006,"I saw Brokeback Mountain a week ago Monday with my husband of 15 years. I have thought about it every day since then.What strikes me is everything that is left unsaid in this movie. Does anyone say ""I love you?"" I know many people have issues with the subject matter, but for me, what is boils down to is that the situation is a tragedy for everyone involved: sons, daughters, wives, lovers, mothers and fathers. Life isn't perfect. But love is.I walked away determined to savor every minute I have with my husband. I will never take our love for granted again.This weekend I am going to the theater again, this time with my mother and sister, to see Brokeback Mountain. I want everyone I care about to see it. It is just too important to miss.Brokeback Mountain will break your heart ... and you will never be the same again.",Brokeback Mountain

I hope many will have the courage to see the movie and realize the courage of so many who live their lives in the shadows. Granted, many of us are friends and neighbors of those same people, but don't know their true struggle. Or, maybe we do and are simply afraid to admit it in public. Be a hero, not a cynic.This movie is about life and love, and how it changes all of us.I've seen it twice and think it's one of the best films I have ever seen.

2020,jansviggo,It doesn't let you go.,9,9 June 2006,"If you go into the cinema with a high expectation because of those applausing reviews and multiple awards nominations, you expect to be blown away.During the movie, I am kind of dissatisfied, as the first part is a bit draggy and boring. Sometimes I cannot be sure if there is a time jump. However as the movie goes on, I become more and more mesmerized by the subtle attraction between Ennis and Jack. Obviously i was hoping to see many *boys love* scenes from both actors. But there is actually only a few passionate 'love act'. Yet, I am not disappointed. There is so much than that. The storyline is basically in a slow pace. Ang Lee has used a lot of time and effort to build up the relationship between two leads. Both Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall are perfect for their roles. Especially Gallenhall, his convincing acting definitely deserves an Oscar. Michelle Williams shines in her role, and Anne Hathway also delivers her performance very well (instead of comedic roles).I nearly burst out crying when it comes to the scene where Jack outbursts 'All we have is Brokeback Mountain' and 'I wish I knew out to quit you', and the end of the movie - Ennis realizes Jack's death, discovers the shirts, and the last scene - both the shirts of Ennis and Jack hanging together in his closet with a postcard of Brokeback Mountain. That is the moment I finally realized that, the story of Ennis and Jack was all over. They found love in each other. But only Jack had the courage to make it real. During that twenty years after the summer in the mountain, Jack didn't abandon the idea of living with Ennis, but Ennis refused. At the end, according to Jack's father, Jack could never fulfill his wishes neither alive or dead. Some said that, he had never proved him love to Jack. But he did love him. While Ennis was completely calm when Jack confessed that he had an affair with another ranch-hand's wife, then he immediately became angry or envy when Jack indicated that he had gay sex in Mexico.The movie didn't make me cry like other tragedies did. After the end of the story, there was a sense of peacefulness. It made you felt sorry for the way Jack died, for the time they've wasted. If Ennis had never seen the terrifying fate of the gay-cowboy in his childhood, he could've shared a happy life with Jack. He would never have pushed Jack away from him and denied the only person he loved.Eventually, I understand why I did not shed a tear for Brokeback Mountain. The overwhelming sadness doesn't break your heart, but gives you a little ache inside your heart and doesn't let you go.",Brokeback Mountain
2021,christie-tom,very touching,8,13 January 2006,"It's rare to see a love story told so sensitively, flaws and all. It doesn't hurry, just lays the story down and lets the characters develop. There are some really touching scenes in the film, especially around Ennis's relationship with his wife and daughters - bits and pieces of it keep coming back to me. It's wonderfully balanced, and the ending is done perfectly. Heath Ledger is as brilliant as everyone says.It didn't just come right out and hit me hard, but I feel it'll keep coming back to me again and again. I'm going to have to see it again before it really sinks in I think. Powerful and restrained.",Brokeback Mountain

This no doubt is because so much of the appreciation is what is going on inside...in the gut, in the heart, in the mind...especially if one has gone through a similar life experience as my soul-mate and I have. Finally someone(s) has captured the very essence of all that I've ever tried to describe and to share with those in my world.

2023,sophe25,Hmmmmm,6,13 January 2006,"I went really excited at the prospect of seeing this movie. All the reviews were promising and I love to look at heath ledger. I came out faintly disappointed. The film is OK, but quite slow. The relationship between the two cowboys happens quite quickly and there is no evidence of any sexual tension prior to their first coupling. I think that if this film was not about two men falling in love and their lives etc, then no one would pay any attention to it. I just expected more to the story. The movie is based on a short story and that is quite evident as few of the ""where something actually happens"" (quite rare) scenes are ever played out to their full extent and could certainly be expanded on. To make room for this, scenes of heath ledger barely talking and Jake gyllenhall pouting could be trimmed dramatically (quite frequent).",Brokeback Mountain

Ennis's visit to Jake's parents home after his death sad. Ennis took the shirt and jacket Jake wore which he saved--still covered in blood. It was a heart twisting scene to be sure. It was plain to see this two Men deeply loved each other in spite of the fact they knocked the heck out of each other a few times. Men will be Men. An absolute must see!

2025,raybrown-1,"A ""social reality"" movie with high impact",10,13 January 2006,"As a gay man, I was impressed by the honesty of the story line. I have, in some respects, been there and done that  but not, by any means, with the monumental impact the movie's story line carries. Among my initial thoughts were, and this is with regard to relationships, not just homosexual relationships: Yes, we as people, not just gay people, can fault society for much of our dysfunctional  either minor or major; however, we, as people, not just gay people, must recognize how much we have personally sacrificed to ""convention,"" and how disastrously misaligned our priorities became in our search for perfection, what was expected, what we thought was ideal, what we thought was right, what we were told was  . We seem always to fail to recognize that relationship IS the most important thing in our lives. Yeah, that really sounds corny! But I believe that this is the message the movie conveys. Whether you are gay, straight, bisexual, asexual, far right wing, far left wing, DO go and see Brokeback Mountain. You will exit the theater with a greater appreciation of what love is.",Brokeback Mountain

2027,carley7744,"Once upon a time, in the year 2006, there was a movie called ""Brokeback Mountain""",10,15 January 2006,"Would could have predicted 20 years ago in the year 2006 the world would be captivated by a gay love story called ""Brokeback Mountain"". It is not just a movie anymore, I believe we are seeing something historic happening. And after seeing the movie I am blown away. It is like what everybody is saying. It haunts you and will not let you go. And that goes to show how successful Ang Lee came to achieving his goal as a director of this great film. What he was trying to do was make the audience become Ennis. By the end of the movie, Ennis and the audience become one. Just like Ennis will be haunted and will never be able to let his love for Jack go, the audience feels the same way about the movie when they leave. There are so many great scenes to choose a favorite from, but my two personal favorites were when Ennis was waiting for his first reunion with Jack after leaving Brokeback Mountain, and my other favorite scene was what I will call the ""Pie Scene"", because anybody who has seen the film will know exactly what I mean, without spoiling it for anybody who hasn't. Two other things that were incredible were the music and the scenery. If anybody is looking for other great gay themed movies, I have a few suggestions. Try either ""Come Undone"", ""Three Dancing Slaves"", or my personal favorite ""The Living End"", which was directed by the awesome Gregg Arakki. I want to thank all the people who made this film for treating the subject matter with respect and dignity, and above all with beauty",Brokeback Mountain

Like once every 5 years, maybe. But I read an article about Brokeback & couldn't get it out of my head. Checked it out online. There was an urgency to seeing it that I cannot explain. Saw it a week & 1/2 ago, and just had to go back this week. It's beyond words, how can one describe it as a ""gay love story"", a ""homosexual relationship"", whatever. I can't. It transcends that. I think of it as a love between two people who connected so powerfully, so deeply. It is simply beautiful. At night I replay scenes in my mind. It has changed me profoundly.I never left a comment on a website before, either. I wonder how I can be so involved with a movie written from a story written about people who never lived? I can't stop thinking about it. I loved seeing it the second time. The men were perfect as Ennis & Jake. Just perfect. Every scene between them was amazing. The 'back & forth' between them was so genuine, so real. I feel almost like a shadow in contrast to their reality.An amazing, beautiful, powerful masterpiece.",Brokeback Mountain

What a love story! I HAVE to go and see this motion picture again! I cannot believe the performances that these two men gave. Almost everyone is talking about Heath Ledger's performance, but I think Jake Gyllenhaal gave the same calibre (no, it's not a spelling mistake - I'm from Canada, we end a lot of words with 're' instead of 'er'!). I am sickened by the thought that so many people will not go and see this movie because they are so closed-minded that they think it is just a ""gay cowboy"" movie.

Heath Ledger's portrayal of Ennis Del Mar was a real as they come and I was also touched by Michelle William's performance as his wife Alma. I'm not sure if the performances carried the characters or if the characters carried the performances. They were all so real and perfectly flawed.I will see it again and I will drag everyone I can to see it with me.

2034,freespirit_guy,Very profound and long overdue,10,15 January 2006,"Brokeback Mountain is the first major release movie to show homosexual life as it really is or has been for so many men. It avoids the stereotypical flamboyance of gay life, while portraying a far more accurate and human depiction of the struggles of homosexual love. Men really do fall deeply in love with each other under the most difficult of social circumstances, too often with tragic results. Undoubtedly this profound, eye-opening, heart-touching movie will help foster a better understanding of some of the complexities, challenges and depth of homosexual love and life in the real world and lead to more tolerance and acceptance.",Brokeback Mountain
2035,amygallilee,Utterly fantastic,10,15 January 2006,"When my best mate asked me to go and see this film, to be honest I wasn't all that bothered. When we got there the cinema was packed, it was very hard to find seats, but when we left many people had already left the cinema and I heard a woman complaining behind me that she could have bought a parmo with the money she had spent on seeing this film. Even my best friend was not all that keen. But me, well..... What can I say, I was speechless. What an utterly fantastic piece of cinema. The performances by the two lads were unfaultable, far better than anything that I have seen in years. The story-line really got to me though. For me this wasn't a film about two gay men, it was about love, about wanting to be with someone who you know is against everything you have been led to believe. It is about passion, friendship, and most of all, it was about how you choose to lead your life. I think what got me was that it brought to my mind the meaning of life, and what it is there for. The question the film posed was whether or not to lead a conventional life or to be who you need to be in order to be happy, damning the consequences. I was seriously touched by this film, especially by the tender scenes played by the two actors. Gyllenhaal made me shed a few tears at his amazing performance. It was fantastic the way the complexity of their emotions, the way in which there was love and also violence. To me, this was a portrayal of human emotion of the deepest kind.The lads need to be praised and supported for their outstanding performances. People need to open their mind in order to see this film, and believe me if you do that, you won't be disappointed.I just hope one day I find a love as deep as that.

It is magnificently shot, the actors perform exquisitely, and my heart truly goes out for the characters. Looking in on the tale of two male cowboys who discover that they are made for each other in the picturesque Brokeback Mountains, I just fell in love with the movie, and it has stuck with me. Great music, handsome and intriguing actors, a perfect plot, and a desperate situation that will change anyone's previous perceptions about homosexuality and the world in which we live in is what makes this movie a masterpiece, and soon to be a classic.

2038,chuck-stein,"It reminds us that we must always be ready to question anything, no matter how sacred or ingrained in our culture, if that thing attacks love in any of its forms.",10,15 January 2006,"Most enlightened people recognize that homosexuality is a naturally occurring variation of animal sexuality that occurs at an approximate 10% population proportion. However, certain human institutions have decided to target this minority for scapegoating because homosexuality is naturally renewing and because the small number of homosexuals will ensure they will always remain relatively helpless. This is good strategy for these institutions because it ensures that they will always be needed, plus they don't have to do anything to keep the ""evil"" under control; they can just posture and persecute and then sit back and take credit for nature's grand plan. This movie illustrates the great human agony and tragedy that results from this kind of human exploitation. This movie asks the audience if the consequences of allowing institutions and individuals to vilify the innocent in order to promote themselves is too costly in terms of human suffering. This movie reminds us all that the real evil is sometimes hidden among the things we take for granted. It reminds us that we must always be ready to question anything, no matter how sacred or ingrained in our culture, if that thing attacks love in any of its forms.",Brokeback Mountain

Please see Eric Bana in ""Munich"", and, gay or not, if you like men, he is a feast for the eyes!! I do not understand why he is not mentioned as an Oscar contender. ""Brokeback"" is getting better reviews than it deserves. Anne Hathaway was not believable as a 30-something Texan, and the horrid fake blond hair she sported was very distracting. See ""Munich"" instead, for its take on relationships, and for what it has to say about our world. Please support movies that have something to teach us and get us to think.",Brokeback Mountain
2040,jack_nasty,Spoiler-free Brokeback Mountain Review,10,15 January 2006,"This film is a masterpiece from beginning to end. Long after the credits have rolled, emotions from the film will linger with you. Memories of the film come back to you, haunting you and reassuring you at the same time. Ang Lee presents us with a brilliantly amazing film that explores a true love that had to be denied due to society's perception of their love. A profoundly honest film, stunning to behold, and superbly acted by the entire cast.Like pieces of a puzzle, the actors and actresses fit together perfectly to create what I would consider the perfect ensemble cast. Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Michelle Williams are all stellar, and give what may be the three best performances of the year. Ledger, in particular, is breath-taking. If there is justice in the world, Ledger should win Best Actor at the Academy Awards. Gyllenhaal should win Best Supporting Actor, and Michelle Williams should win Best Supporting Actress. BBM should win Best Picture, and Ang Lee should win Best Director. Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana should win Best Adapted Screenplay.To put it simply, Brokeback Mountain is one of the most affecting romances of the decade, along with one of the best films of the decade.",Brokeback Mountain
2041,vince55,Haunting,10,20 January 2006,I went to see Brokeback mountain 2 times and probably will probably go to see it again. I can't stop thinking about the movie. I grew up in the 60's and can relate to the frustration and isolation these characters experienced. The most important message is that men can become emotionally involved before they become sexually involved. Similar to the way women relate to men. It's always been permissible for 2 women to fall in love and even become sexually active. But 2 men having sex was labeled strictly a forbidden territory. No one has ever (until this film) looked at the possibility of men getting emotionally involved with another men and experiencing the sex after the emotional intamacy. This movie may be about a gay relationship but it goes much deeper. It defines LOVE!,Brokeback Mountain
2042,johann1,Cathartic,10,18 January 2006,"The impact is shattering; all the more so because it was slow acting. When I came out of the cinema I was a bit relieved that the story had not ripped open a lot of painful memories - and there are some. However, half an hour later I could feel the emotion welling up, and an hour after that I was crying. The movie is so subtle and skillful in gently peeling back the scar tissue covering the psychic lesions of past years that I didn't realise it was happening.Scene after scene replays itself in my head. There is such a sense of loss, of desolation, of lives largely wasted and unfulfilled that it was like a death in the family. These last few days have been a period of grieving. What could have been and should have been creates a sadness which permeates the whole movie. This is catharsis time.",Brokeback Mountain
2043,pubcampo,Best Love Story Of the Year,10,16 January 2006,Movie left me feeling very emotional. A forbidden love that never gets to realize the potential. This is best far the best love story I have ever seen portraying what it like to not be able to live your life without fear or hate A great movie for the non-gay previewer hopefully will not be taken out of context. All actors in this movie deserve a golden globe. The movie was a little longer but was worth it. I did not want to miss a part. I felt truly saddened by the fact that they never really got the chance to live there love. While they were victims there were others in the movie that suffered likewise. This is one of those movies that you find your self thinking about long after it is over. Go see the movie you will not regret it it is well worth the time.,Brokeback Mountain
2044,morgan-189,watch and open your minds......,10,16 January 2006,"I saw ""Brokeback Mountain"" Saturday evening. Unbelievably well crafted, the integrated control of narrative, acting, scene, technique, and thematic insight are beyond stunning. Immensely impressive. It unfolds the intensity of affection between Ennis and Jack, how they try to do right in and for society, yet thereby are further distanced from what is most right for them. That is the nature of classical tragedy: to know your situation, overcome it by the best means you have, and thereby be defeated.... The catharsis of tragedy wrenches us with the insight of a mighty truth and the horror of a finalized reality. I, like so many who have seen it, was so moved by it because it recalled the many loves that were repressed and lost in a sterile and corrosive environment of fear and hate against love and intimacy. Who cares what awards it get. Its rewards are with everyone who saw it and understood themselves better. The movie echoes many things, ""The Last Picture Show,"" the photography of Ansel Adams, ""American Gothic"" by Grant Woods....",Brokeback Mountain
2045,APalermo,Broken Lives on Brokeback Mountain,8,16 January 2006,"Broken Lives on Brokeback MountainBrokeback Mountain is about broken lives in the back drop of majestic mountains and gorgeous actors, Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger, who fall in love and the pain that results from their actions. It was a very sad movie to watch- the torture these men, Jack and Ennis, go through and the deceit they put their wives and children through, but it is very thought provoking. The film, up for seven Golden Globe nominations, deserves the attention it is getting, because it dares to break through stereotypes and forces the viewer to rethink masculinity, intolerance and love.Cowboys- a symbol of the West, manly, rugged, strong, self-reliant all stereotypesGays- feminine, deviants, weak, queerall stereotypes...but gays come in all forms, handsome/plain, young/old, strong/weak and masculine/feminine.In English, we have but one word for love. In Greek however there are many kinds of love; philia- brotherly love, storge- family love, eros- romantic love, and agape- the unconditional love of God. We all form bonds of love with people we spend time with, and the actors out of their own desires, cross over from the natural feelings for another to a love that in their society is forbidden. The price they pay for their pleasure is torment, jealously and sadness that comes with any relationship that is built on lies and against social stigmas.The actors are sympathetic characters. The acting is superb and daring. True to life, the film does not show a rosy picture of the results of their choices.My son-in-law was raised on a cattle ranch and farm in Alberta, Canada. Much of the film was shot in Alberta. The scenery was the most enjoyable part of the movie that may be a little slow for those who prefer fast-paced films.The downfall of the characters is the lies that they tell to cover up their love which leads to disrespect and betrayal to their wives and children. The film is real in showing the consequences. One is free to make their own choices behind closed doors or tents; if one chooses to make their choices public, they must deal with the consequences from society. The cowboys prefer to keep a secret rather than to break free and share their lives openly together. Not an easy choice to say the least.Much of the controversy with the film lies with those who don't believe in the homosexual lifestyle. Romans 1 in the Bible says that God is not pleased with the homosexual act and it is taught in Christian circles to be a sin. The reality is many people defy that teaching which is their absolute right to do. God does not force himself on anyone. But those that do must also deal with the consequences of what it does to their families, spouses and children. There is a big difference between acceptance and approval. As a tolerant society, one should be tolerant of other's choices and beliefs. That does not make one have to approve of their choices as normal and appropriate. Moreover, we all miss the mark in some way. We all need mercy and grace.Role models in any society teach the younger generation how to act. Those who are born with tendencies of the opposite sex can learn to behave in more gender appropriate ways. This is not a propaganda film with total sympathy to one way of thinking. It just gives you a glimpse into the reality that others walk.Why didn't Ennis take his wife camping and show her the beauty of the mountains? This was selfishness on Ennis' part. The film portrays family life as cumbersome with crying children, although there were small glimpses of happier times with his wife Alma, Michelle Williams. The main theme portrayed marriage as a 'ball and chain.' Williams, from Dawson's Creek fame, is a high contender for best supporting actress. Similarly, director Ang Lee should be rewarded for being both provocative and artistic at the same time.The film showed all the heterosexual men to be jerks. Their boss at Brokeback Mountain where they met and worked as sheepherders was overbearing. Ennis' parents died when he was young, Jack had a father who was weak and absent in his son's life and had a father-in-law who was domineering. Cruel men also committed acts of violence against homosexuals. Was it intentional on the part of the writer to have no strong, positive male figures in the film? Strong families are the foundation of any society. The debate about the structure of our society will continue.On the day that we went to see Brokeback Mountain, we learned from ultra-sound that our daughter will be having her second child, a son. This boy will be taught by his father what it means to be a man. With love and nurture, he will find his place in society whether it is to be a rancher like his grandfather, a philosophy professor like his father, a lawyer like his great-grandfather or a plumbing contractor like his American grandfather? The choice will be his. Consequently, it is up to each society to determine what their norms will be. For the sake of the family and our future, we must choose wisely.Brokeback Mountain is a story of forbidden love that will challenge you. Not for the weak of heart, intolerant or the young.",Brokeback Mountain

This is the level of longing and tears that this film brings out of anyone who has loved and lost or at least loved at all. The mix of tears, longing, hope and sorrow that all come bubbling to the forefront of my very being is amazing. Thank you to all who worked on or are in this phenomenal film. Tom",Brokeback Mountain
2047,russenator,What an incredible experience!,10,16 January 2006,"Trying to describe this movie in mere words can in no way do it justice. I read Proulx's incredible story right before seeing the movie and wondered how it could be re-created on the screen with the same impact; it exceeded my expectations a thousand-fold. Anyone who rejects this movie based on stereotypes or prejudices ought to be shot first and then asked why. Unless you have walked in the shoes of another person, you can never know the emotional price another might be paying for his or her feelings and life experiences. What a mind-blowing experience to witness your own life on the screen and feel relieved that a movie can portray your own reality.",Brokeback Mountain
2048,snuffle007,Amazing and heartfelt...a must see,10,7 February 2006,"Well, I went to see this film in the UK about two weeks ago and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. I have now seen it 6 times! The film is an absolute masterpiece. It restores your faith in the quality of films being produced. Ang Lee is the master in subtlety and imagery, both he uses with enormous success in Brokeback Mountain.The actors are both fantastic. Heath Ledger as the stoic and repressed Ennis Delmar. Jake Gyllenhaal as the hopeless romantic Jack Twist. All through the film I found myself feeling the same emotions they were showing me, that is how amazing they are. They were able to say so much without saying a word through gestures, body language and eye contact. They were breathtaking.It is beautifully shot with an amazing score that really tugs at your heart strings.It is so much more than the ""gay cowboy movie"" which is a horrible title pinned on it by the media. It is a love story, very much along the same lines as Romeo and Juliet; two people in love who can't be together, who have a tragic ending. And it really is that, TRAGIC. The only reason the two can't be together is because society in 1960's American West was/is extremely homophobic. This makes you think about just how much people suffer at the hands of such ideas. This film has received a lot of negative press regarding the sexual content within it. Too me, this is hypocrisy. You see much more graphic sex scenes in love stories about two straight people in love, so why all the fuss? Even banning the film has occurred in some areas of the USA, because they say that ""middle America doesn't want to see it"". Well, seeing as it has grossed more than any other Oscar Contender, I think you could say that the cinemas have completely under-estimated Middle American people!I think this film is so popular because it makes you start to look at your own lives, the loves you have had, the regrets you have, the mistakes you have made.I really can't stress enough what an amazingly beautiful masterpiece of cinema this is.GO AND SEE IT",Brokeback Mountain
2049,carlay0531,A Very moving picture,10,17 January 2006,I recently saw Brokeback Mountain. It's been a few days since I saw it and it is still affecting me. I thought it was a beautiful love story. Every scene was fraught with such intense emotion. I can't begin to tell anyone how moved I am by the experience. Heath and Jakes characters were so real it was very easy to sympathize with both of their personalities. It was amazing to me that my own demeanor during the movie mirrored what was taking place on film. I was not truly at ease during the scenes when they were not together. I thought it was amazing that the movie could make me feel that and capture that ache. It was a beautiful movie all the way around. The way they handled the wives roles was dead on. As a woman I can relate to both reactions of the women. This is definitely a movie to have in your classics library.,Brokeback Mountain
2050,rimjhim,Wow! Nice,9,17 January 2006,"While the performances are uniformly fantastic, nothing can quite prepare the mind for the work that Heath Ledger provides. As an actor prone to overcompensating, Ledger's Ennis is a man of decidedly few words, yet is a thunderstorm of heartache on the inside. This is quite literally a full-bodied performance, using all of Ledger as Ennis thrashes about watching his life fall apart due to his self-loathing, distance, and towering regret. Unable to give himself over to his feelings, Ennis's heart withers and dies, only witnessing moments of happiness with Jack, which allows him to be the man he wants to be without fear of judgment. Saying Ledger is Oscar-worthy here isn't strong enough: this is a career-best performance, and a crucial element to the necessary feeling of frustration that powers the film",Brokeback Mountain
2051,powerpc22,We can all relate to Brokeback Mountain...,10,19 January 2006,"It has been 5 days since I have seen this film. I had to drive 100 miles (to Durango, CO) because our local theater is not showing the film - yet. I feel compelled to make a post on this board although it will not be as good as some posts I have read here. (Casey Cornelious, my hat is off to you!) I cannot get this film out of my mind. I have been a very lucky man. I have had 3 Brokeback Mountains in my time. I was 20 years old in 1985 and had the experience to share a room with a High School friend in Texas over that summer and we became VERY CLOSE. When the summer ended HE broke it off and eventually went into the Army. I have somewhat kept up with him and after seeing this film have mailed him a card asking him to go see Brokeback Mountain. Stay tuned.(My Ennis Del Mar).My second Brokeback was with a friend of many years who was in a very unhappy marriage and one night after a fight with his wife, one thing led to another and we have been seeing each other off and on for over 10 years now. In the last couple of years I have somewhat broken it off but we still care for each other and talk by phone occasionally. (My Jack Twist). My third Brokeback Mountain was the one that has hurt the most. Although this relationship never became physical it has left the deepest scars. A few years ago I met a young man who had just graduated from High School. We worked in the same place and became good friends and he eventually rented a room from me. We became close , like brothers, and had no secrets from each other. We knew everything about each other and I truly bonded with this person. One night things started to move in a different direction and he stopped and said that my friendship was more important to him than our being lovers. Well, I REALLY fell for him then! A short time later he came down with a rare form of cancer (the 200th known case with a 2% survival rate), after many visits to the hospital we bonded even more and I was holding his hand when he took his last breath (he was 27). When I saw this movie I completely lost it. All those feelings of loss and emptiness came rolling in like a tidal wave and hit me right there in the theater. I have never seen a film that has affected me so profoundly as this one has and is still continuing to do. I understand that this is just a movie, but living in Colorado and New Mexico I have SEEN these characters in real life. I think about the scene when Ennis went to the Twist home to get Jack's ashes and I think of Jack's Mother and all that poor woman has gone through. The ONLY happiness she probably ever had in her whole life WAS Jack, and now he is GONE. The ONLY light she ever had in her life. This is apparent in the homes interior and exterior. I have walked up on that porch myself many times. The wind is always blowing and is always bone chilling cold or like the breath of hell! Jack's Mother will have to live the rest of her days with Jack's father. A sorry, uneducated man that has all the answers. I know she knew about Jack (Mama always knows)and she knew who Ennis was and how much he meant to Jack. She knew about the shirts in the closet and she never told her husband and NEVER will. It was obvious that she wanted to talk to Ennis more , but she was afraid. That is why she asked him to come back and visit. Maybe Ennis will after MR. TWIST is put in the family plot.Ennis will live alone the rest of his life and never love anyone else again, male or female. He will just become a broken down old cowboy who only knows hard work and little pay. THESE CHARACTERS ARE REAL! I have seen them with my own eyes in the last 20 years I have spent in Colorado and New Mexico. I have a great respect to Ang Lee, Annie Proloux, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyallanhaal AND ALL THE OTHERS THAT MADE THIS FILM POSSIBLE AND for bringing this story to life for all the world to see! It needed to be told. Finally a movie with a gay theme but not a stereotypical gay theme. Well done!",Brokeback Mountain
2052,patryk_toronto,BBM A Serious Work Of Art,10,27 January 2006,"Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal put on an Oscar winning performance that is more real and true to one's heart than any other love story of this past decade. It is a complete revolutionary step in movie making, and will not be soon forgotten. Heath and Jake truly have put on THE performance of their careers. For the first time in a ""gay"" movie, have the actors not perpetuated the typical stereotype of a gay man. There were no weak wrists or lisps of any sort. Only two guys, profoundly inflicted with hard-to-ignore emotions. I have never experienced a movie like Brokeback Mountain; It has captured my heart and refuses to let it go. Many movies come and go, but few make as big of an impression on me as Brokeback Mountain has. Thank you Ang Lee and the entire cast!",Brokeback Mountain
2053,vgobaira,Beautiful!,10,18 January 2006,"I cannot remember the last film that moved me like Brokeback Mountain moved me. I had so many mixed emotions. This movie wrenched my heart and left me wrecked for days after, but in a good way. Heath Ledger's Ennis was so well portrayed because he showed the fight within Ennis when it came to anything emotional. Ennis wanted to feel but would not allow his emotions to come up without a fight first. Ultimately he would lose to his emotions, a tortuous fight he was happy to lose. He was noble and guarded. Jake Gyllenhall's Jack was such a great character, a happy, friendly, charmer, who was totally devoted to Ennis. It brings to mind the scene when Jack shows up after hearing sbout Ennis' divorce and says ""Well, here I am."" He brought out in Ennis what no other person could bring out. I really hope more people see this film because it is not a gay-sex film, it is a love story and shows that love has not boundaries when it arrives. I find myself waiting for the movie trailer to come up on television, just to get another glimpse of the scene by the river where Ennis is holding Jack, rocking back and forth, humming a song. As a heterosexual female, I believe everyone longs for a love like the love that was portrayed between these two beautiful men. That includes the happy moments as well as the angry moments. I am counting the days until this film comes out on DVD but it looks like I will have to go and see it again. I have a hard time paying for movies but I would gladly pay again to see it.",Brokeback Mountain
2054,Drquest92,Great Film,10,18 January 2006,"This powerful, sweeping film contains love, emotion, guilt, sacrifice and much more. It is a sad and tragic story, but one that is remarkable and beautifully done. This movie will challenge you to examine your convictions with regard to mankind. It is emotionally packed from start to finish. It will dare you to deny these men their humanity and love. The performances are wrenching and brilliant. I saw this film and the theater was packed. There were a variety of people there from all walks of life. It was nice to see many people viewing this film and being objective along the way. Yes, this film is controversial, but isn't that the best kind.",Brokeback Mountain
2055,fallcolors,painfully beautiful,10,18 January 2006,"The story is beautiful and romantic and yet heart wrenchingly sad at times. It's the sort of movie that remains in your thoughts for days afterwards. It's gentle and slow paced, rough around the edges, and the most beautiful Western I've ever seen.Since the original work was a short story, there was no painful cutting process that goes along with whittling down a novel to a feature length film. The movie remains true to Annie Proulx's work and both movie and short story are powerful, high quality pieces of writing.For those of you who are passing up this movie because you don't want to watch gay cowboy porn, please, please put aside your preconceived notions and go see the film. There are hardly any graphic shots and the story is beautiful.",Brokeback Mountain
2056,rrch36,Excellent,10,18 January 2006,"The movie was very well done and I want to commend the writer for showing people a true side of being gay. Does it really matter if two people find love who they are? I serious believe it will wake up people and hopefully understand what kind of lives gay people live. The movie was very moving and after seeing it it still leaves me with a hollow spot in my heart to know that many people had to live this way and still do in this present day. The actors were superb and the scenery was breathtaking.It also shows that many gay people get married because they cannot live their lives the way they want to because of the pressures of our society and than others have to suffer because of the way our society thinks. I recommend if you are reading this go see the movie before you make an opinion. Another point that I would like to make is that not all areas are showing the movie. Why is it that you see what the world is like, killing, violence, hatred, just a few to name in other movies and they are shown in all areas and when it comes to two people of the same sex not doing any harm to anyone it is banned? Again please go and see the movie with a clear mind and than hopefully you will understand what it is to be gay and to accept these people a little more. Everyone who had anything to do with this movie did a superb job and deserves to be commented.",Brokeback Mountain

This story has haunted me for the last 48 hours and I feel I must add a comment. I was very impressed with the movies pace, its beautiful quieter moments cut between others of sharp violence and passion. The characters are so natural and human, the story so true, that you are drawn into their challenges. I feel that further rich secrets will be revealed in future viewings. This was a wonderful challenge to a well known stereotype. Thank you Mr Lee for bringing such an amazing story into our minds and hearts. This is an masterful achievement and will inspire my future film making.",Brokeback Mountain
2058,kittybinks,Brokeback mountain,10,19 January 2006,"No gushing review here just facts! This movie is in turns disturbing, heart-aching, emotionally draining, thought provoking and downright brutal. Ang Lee doesn't pull his punches using the most heterosexual of male actors to portray the two leads and drawing one of the strongest performances seen for many years. Truly a masterclass in cinema. Surely time if not sooner, then later will bestow this movie with the status CLASSIC! Miss this movie at your peril i certainly intend to see this at the cinema one more time. Do not wait for the DVD. I thoroughly recommend the soundtrack to accompany this. More movies like this please less CGI fodder.",Brokeback Mountain
2059,lispencoat,"Outstanding, must see movie of the year",10,6 February 2006,"It is easy to see why Brokeback Mountain is receiving rave reviews and is being showered (and rightly so) with awards. This is simply one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall are without doubt outstanding, with the supporting cast giving some great performances, notably Michelle Williams who must be heading for stardom. Ang Lee is a director of the highest calibre, who takes you on the most wonderful and sumptuous journey, whereas a lesser mortal would have made an absolute pigs ear of this!! I can't recommend this movie highly enough and if you only go to the cinema once this year, this is the movie to see. I enjoyed it so much I bought the soundtrack (and I don't like country and western music!!!)",Brokeback Mountain
2060,tattimm,"""The Christian Agenda""",10,6 February 2006,"My review of the movie is that it is simply outstanding in all ways, in spite of its controversial subject matter. Those whose vision is not blocked by the giant flashing red ""GAY"" sign will see a truly inspiring (if sad) film and walk away with a changed heart. Kudos to all involved.It's interesting to read the reviews from those who seem to have such a violent reaction to this movie. They blather on about ""The Gay Agenda"" and morality and they don't think they should have to ""have the gay lifestyle crammed down their throat."" Hmmmm. Let me see. If I'm not mistaken, gays have had the heterosexual lifestyle crammed down their throats for 7000+ years. And forcibly too, as the penalty for noncompliance includes everything from vandalism and ostracism to death by lynching. Do I detect a ""Christian Agenda"" here? And if you were to get a look at ""The Gay Agenda,"" the one that seems to strike such fear and panic into the hearts of some, you'd see that it simply says ""leave me alone."" Most gays just want to be left to live their lives like the rest of us and love whoever it is they fall in love with, without fear of retribution, torture or death. A society that visits such wrath on one of its members simply because of who they fell in love with is one that is truly immoral. Jesus would be ashamed.This movie is actually about ""The Christian Agenda,"" which shapes our society and expects that we will all look alike and think alike and feel alike and doesn't tolerate difference well. This is a film about the social pressure to conform and what happens to people who don't fit in. Not because they don't fit in but because of how we treat those who don't fit in and the messages our society gives about people who don't conform. This affects one's whole life and the choices they make, often with unfortunate and sometimes tragic outcomes. This is so aptly illustrated in this film. Fortunately, most TRUE Christians are more willing to accept and tolerate difference, just as their Savior did. It's their judgmental and hateful comrades with their own ""agenda,"" and who also happen to be the loudest, that give the rest of them a bad name.",Brokeback Mountain
2061,dcollison,A brilliant work! Best of the best!,10,9 February 2006,"A number of reviewers are fascinated by the presentation in ""Brokeback Mountain"" of two ""manly"" men having sex with each other. The man's man: he's the one who rides a bull, shoots elk, tosses bales of hay from a pick-up and throws punches at strangers when caught in a rage. These reviewers imagine that macho men don't have sex with macho men. Only limp-wristed, swishy queens engage in man-on-man sex. And they grudgingly recognize the lisping queens as long as the sacrosanct image of the macho man is reserved for heterosexual males.As a gay man, I've a different perspective on this purported conundrum.I live in a small town in Alaska. My gay friends and I have a joke that goes something like this: Question: ""If we hosted a party for the town's gay men, how many would show up?"" Answer: ""Depends on how many could sneak away from their wives for the evening."" In my community, I'd guess there are probably more ""gay"" married men than ""out"" gay men. And to a large extent, these closeted men pass as straight because heterosexuals naively imagine that all men are straight. For most of middle-America, gays simply don't exist. A couple of incidents demonstrate this prejudice.When my partner and I began dating six years back, we were spotted together by a co-worker of his. I'd known the same fellow  let's call him Bob  because we were in opposing camps at various legislative hearings on bills impacting gays & lesbians. At any rate, Bob saw my partner and I together one day. Later, he pulled my partner aside and warned him against associating with me, a known ""gay activist""! Now Bob had worked with my partner side-by-side for more than ten years. Though my partner was not married, had never dated a woman during this period, Bob assumed that my partner was straight! And he was warning his ""straight"" friend against socializing with a known gay man.In another incident, my partner and I waited in an airport terminal. My partner was greeted by a friend of his family, a man who had known him since he was a boy. My partner introduced me and mentioned to his friend that we were traveling to France and Italy for five weeks. The two spoke for a few minutes. And then his friend asks, ""So are you married yet?"" What about this picture didn't he understand: two adult men  in their mid- to late-thirties  traveling to Europe for a five-week vacation! Were we just passing time until each of us found a good woman to settle down with? Contrast these experiences with that of another friend. The company he worked for transferred him to the Netherlands for a few years. Shortly after settling into his new home, his neighbor  another male  stopped by to welcome him. One of the first questions he asked my friend: ""Have you a girlfriend or boyfriend?"" This question revealed that for this man  and perhaps the majority of Dutch citizens  a person isn't assumed to be either gay or straight.Reviewers who are fixated with the notion of a macho Ennis bedding a manly Jack often buy into the concept that the machismo of the manly man is a fuller, richer expression of masculinity than the stereotyped queen. In short, manly men are real men; queers are half-baked men.One reviewer goes so far as to suggest that the ""manly"" qualities of Ennis and Jack make them ""fully developed human characters."" It's not a description I'd give Ennis. Few other characters in contemporary cinema are so one-sided, so emotionally shut-down as Ennis Del Mar.For instance, there are at least three scenes in the film where Ennis imagines he may lose Jack, and he has no emotional coping skills to deal with this loss. The first incident takes place shortly after Ennis learns that their stay on Brokeback Mountain will be cut short. Jack is in a playful mood and lassos Ennis. They chum around, an accident happens, and suddenly Ennis grows angry, punches Jack and storms off.In a second incident, Ennis has just said good-bye to Jackhe moves off to an alley, collapses in sobs and throws punches at a stucco wall. When a stranger shows concern, Ennis rages and screams at the man, warning him away or he'll be whipped.In the third incident, their last meeting together, Jack wonders aloud at why he can't ""quit"" Ennis. Ennis begins to sob and when the two are in each other's arms, he begins to hit Jack.Yes, these incidents suggest that the ""macho"" man might have a tender side. But the more predominant emotion  indeed, the only emotion that he can effectively express  is rage and angereven to the one he loves! And this in fact sums up the problem of the macho man: save for rage, anger and aggression, the macho man can't feel or express emotions. Most all emotions are bottled up, stuffed until they burst forth in a rage and fury that knows no limits.The tragedy of ""Brokeback Mountain"" extends beyond the Ennis's and Jack's of this world. The living tragedy of the film is found in America's favorite cowboys  ""W"" and ""Dick""  wrecking havoc not only at home on the range, but around the world. Cold men with the stiff upper lips who are so divorced from feelings of compassion, empathy and love that their direct responsibility for the criminal slaughter of more than 2,400 Americans, more than a 100,000 Iraqis quite simply is of no concern to them. These are just pesky details that gets lost in the lies and untruths they use to fabricate the cowboy playset they mistake for reality.",Brokeback Mountain
2062,bfissarahsmom,"Good, but...",4,19 January 2006,"I went to see this movie today. The acting is brilliant, and the mountain views are breathtaking. That being said, I can truthfully say that I am not seeing what everyone else seems to see. I applaud the actors, directors etc, for taking on this story, but without spoiling it for those who have not yet seen this movie, I have to say that I was not all that impressed. I had a very difficult time understanding Heath Ledger; it seemed as if he were mumbling most of the time. Not even considering the nature of this love story, I saw serious moral flaws in Jack's character. As I said, the acting is brilliant, but there are points in the movie wherein the characters are weakly played, and that takes away from the movie.",Brokeback Mountain
2063,anglomx,To Hype or Not to Hype,10,19 January 2006,"I've now seen this film 4 times, including on opening night in L.A. when the audience was really into it and rose en masse to give it a standing ovation filled with wild applause at the end. When I looked around as the lights came up, there were red eyes and wet faces everywhere.But now something strange is happening with all the rave reviews and the cascade of awards. The audience seems to be breathless with anticipation and the movie is not delivering what they expect. It's hard to explain. My latest viewing, at a packed Noontime weekday matinée in a medium-sized Southwestern city, was so different from my first experience, primarily because the audience didn't seem to know quite how to react to the film. At the end there was a smattering of applause, but not much emotion behind it. And I didn't see many tears, just a lot of grim faces.It reminded me of when I saw ""American Beauty"" a couple of months after it was released. I had heard SO much praise for the film (and Kevin Spacey in particular) that when it was over I sat there thinking, ""That's it?"" It was really good, but I had a hard time imagining that it would be thought substantial enough to even be considered for the Best Picture Oscar. And then, of course, it and Spacey both won (and were it not for Hilary Swank's first tour de force Oscar performance in ""Boy's Don't Cry"" then Annette Benning probably would have won also for Best Actress). If I had seen ""AB"" before the incredible buzz built around it, then I might have been one of the people buzzing the loudest to get people to see ""this cool new flick."" But as it was, I was mildly disappointed. Too much hype.While there is no doubting the ""heft"" of ""Brokeback Mountain,"" I wonder if a lot of moviegoers aren't now reacting with some befuddlement over the mountains of critical praise being heaped upon it. It is such a quiet (yet powerful) film, but I think it is really best appreciated without the huge build up it has gotten. Except, of course, now the cat is out of the bag. So, what to do? I personally cannot wait to own it on DVD so that I can savor each and every moment, frame by frame and line by line.Which reminds me of another problem: as the film goes into wider release, the projection and sound systems in more and more theatres are likely not to be up to the task. If you stop munching popcorn, pay attention and are lucky enough to see the movie in a theatre with a decent sound system, there isn't any problem deciphering Heath Ledger's strangled delivery of lines (which is dead-on perfect in its portrayal of laconic Western male speech). But the last theatre I saw it in had a terrible sound system and during half the movie audience members were whispering back and forth to each other to repeat bits of dialogue, especially his.At least Ennis' last line was clearly audible. I've heard MANY people complain elsewhere that they couldn't understand it and had to ask their companions what he actually said, which tells me that some theatres are doing a truly horrible job of showing this film properly. And that's a real shame given the stunning cinematography and the exquisite screen adaptation (every syllable of which demands to be fully heard and appreciated).Bottom line: it is now tempting to try to restrain my enthusiasm for this film when people ask me about it. I think ""Brokeback Mountain"" DOES live up to its hype, but I'm also sure that a lot of folks would appreciate it more if their expectations weren't so inflated when they walk into the cinema to see it.",Brokeback Mountain
2064,hatboy742000,"A beautiful, melancholy statement on relationships. It will haunt you for days.",10,19 January 2006,"I've never cried at any movie. Ever. This one had me fighting the tears back the first, second, and third time at the theatre.From the first few plucks of the guitar and the pre-dawn landscape in the opening I knew I could sink into this film. I've been anticipating--longing--for this movie to arrive after seeing the trailer several months ago. Being an emotional dude who loves works about loneliness and relationships, with a beautifully stark landscape to boot, I couldn't miss it.I still can't believe that something as bold as this has been created and distributed to the masses. Is this country ready? For the most part, yes, but judging by some hateful, negative reviews, including a few surprisingly posted here, there are some people who sadly are not.It's really too bad that some people are missing the point, calling this movie an ""agenda"" simply because it has a story between two gay men. It's such a sad movie (a wonderfully sad movie) that hardly glorifies the relationship between Jack and Ennis. The only ""agenda"" I could take away from the movie is that if you're not true to yourself you end up hurting those you love most.The melancholy starkness to the movie--little dialogue in the beginning, shots of wide lonely vistas, the acoustic guitar (Gustavo Santaollala should have gotten an award)--will pull you in and makes you feel their pangs of loneliness. Hearing the music from the film now is still a punch in the emotional gut and tear jerking.Go see this film. It gets inside of you and you'll never forget it. Anyone who is a die-hard romantic, has loved and lost, or has loved someone ""forbidden,"" will be able to relate and you won't be able to see it enough.",Brokeback Mountain
2065,StephenSu,The Globe's Best Picture in Oscar Award,9,8 March 2006,"Despite all the globe's choice of Brokeback Mountain as their favorite movies, the results still went crashing to the ground.We went to see this movie when it was first shown in Taiwan. At first, I still remembered that the media here promoted the movie mainly because of a Taiwanese director Ang Lee. Surprisingly, at the beginning the audience was usually straight couples, and then quickly, the movie widely spread and hit the box office in Taiwan. Who would think about it as a hit compared to those mainstreams of Hollywood popcorn movies? Later on, the Annie Proulx's novel followed on and became so popular that it's no way to get her Brokeback Mountain and Close Long in the bookstore. There was even a Brokeback Mountain syndrome that described the audience would be downcast whenever thinking about the end or listening to the soundtrack and the song.A happy-ending love story will definitely makes you smile in the cinema. But you won't remember what exactly the scene is after few months. Although I do wish these cowboys would happily live together, the ending of Brokeback Mountain seems to be much powerful and memorable for all of us, and the days in Brokeback are the most beautiful encounter. Nevertheless, Brokeback Mountain is still our Best Picture in Oscar Award.",Brokeback Mountain
2066,alexapple74,There is a story behind the story we see in Brokeback Mountain,8,20 January 2006,"I was touched by the film. I am a homosexual, but I reject the label ""gay"" because I don't identify with the gay culture or gay political agenda. Watching the film, I felt I saw both the ""gay love story"" we're expected to see, but also the story the film tells unintentionally. I see two men who struggle with the demands of manhood and cling to each other for comfort. In Ennis Del Mar I see a man who has isolated himself from other men, and who struggles with aggression toward them. In Jack Twist I see a man longing for masculine affirmation, affection, and approval.The film fills in points that Annie Proulx's short story leaves out, but the short story also hints at childhood experiences for both Ennis and Jack that may have formed them into the young men who ultimately find an intense connection on Brokeback. For Ennis there's the loss of his parents and a history of violence and rejection with his brother. For Jack there's a violently intimate episode with a cruel father where he learns he is hopelessly different from his dad. It's no wonder to me that Jack instantly assumes the submissive posture toward Ennis when it comes time to sexualize their feelings for each other.So these two men who don't feel wholly male, with the help of alcohol and privacy, have no way to process their newfound closeness other than through sex. Sexualizing their intimacy traps their otherwise brotherly feelings for each other in a romantic cul-de-sac. It also teaches each of them to see themselves as secretly gay.In the short story, Ennis admits to masturbating to the fantasy of Jack the four years between working together and their next meeting. With the reward of orgasm, he confirms to his psyche over and over again that making love to Jack is his true condition. The identity he's forced on himself stays with him to the point that he feels strangers in town can see right through him.Perhaps used to the submissive posture sexually, Jack can't find sexual satisfaction with women the way Ennis can. For whatever reason  I think it has a lot to do with the traumatic event with his father  he feels the need for a sexual connection with men more intensely then Ennis. He patronizes male prostitutes in Mexico and sets his sights on liaisons with other guys. It's sad to me that when he has an opportunity to make a friend out of the ranch foreman while their wives ""powder their noses,"" it immediately turns into a secret romantic proposition. All these experiences confirm even more to Jack that he's a gay man living a life he doesn't want.But it could have been different right? They could have left their wives and children and moved in together and live always the fantasy they stoke a few times a year. But for that, Jack wouldn't have died either changing a tire, or in maybe from gay-bashing.Maybe, but I suspect the secret idyllic fantasy-world they create is in fact what keeps their romance going 20 years. The intense periodic connections they experience turn the rest of their lives into barren deserts interrupted occasionally by the oasis of their romance. I suspect that making their romance ""regular"" is precisely what would have made it boring for one or both of them  just as boring as the regular lives they've had with their wives. Like a lot of gay ""couples"" who move in together and remain companions into old age, I can see them abandoning sex with each other because it would lose its mystery. With their sexual interest in each other spent, I see them ending up best friends at most, with the sort of brotherhood that they could have had without the sex.So I ultimately, I set aside the story of a perfectly quaint romance ruined by the demands of a cruel, intolerant society. I see the two heterosexual marriages that could have stood a chance if they hadn't been ruined by homosexual experimentation. I see the missed opportunity of healthy masculine connectedness that Ennis and Jack both abjured for the sake of gay sex and romance. I see the missed opportunities for each of them to become completely male in their self-understandings.Yes, it could have been different for Ennis and Jack. Instead of sexualizing and romanticizing their friendship, they could have connected as brother-men to each other and to other guys. Instead of disdaining their respective marriages for getting in the way of their romance, they could have supported each other as brother husbands and fathers. Ennis didn't need a Jack to sexually dominate to feel confirmed in his manhood. Jack didn't need Ennis to literally penetrate him in order to feel like he was getting the manhood that was missing in his psyche. These are hells they chose instead of accepting manhood.The tragedy is that these guys screwed when they really could have been fishing together. The tragedy is that they limited their male connections mostly to each other. Ennis refuses his wife's entreaty to connect with other families at their church. Jack refuses to make another male friend in a non-sexual context. Instead of Ennis and Jack turning to alcohol to cover up his wounded masculinity, he could have sought counseling from a caring male figure, either psychological or spiritual.There won't be a sequel to ""Brokeback Mountain."" But I hope for a happy ending for Ennis. I hope for a happy ending where he takes down his shrine to idealized Jack and finds a Godly way to feel complete in himself as a man while learning to cherish what was healthy in his friendship with a fallen brother.",Brokeback Mountain

I believe that this story gives all who read / watch it an insight into their own personal experiences. The relationship between Ennis and Jack, show us all that we have the ability to love with all we have. We may not always triumph with this love or in fact enjoy it to it's potential, however we can still love. We all have our own Brokeback Mountain, for some of us it is good enough to have it as a memory of times lost, for some it is a lynch pin in our very existence. I would like to challenge all who read this to tell me how they were changed by this story. I know that i can love and am grateful for the care and thought used to produce this timeless classic. Thank you for reading.",Brokeback Mountain
2068,meachams,Surprisingly very good,9,21 January 2006,"I was thrilled with the whole production BUT heard on BBC News this week the comment that ""Worth seeing for 'the spectacular and beautiful WYOMING scenery"" Correct me but wasn't it filmed in ALBERTA ? and I recognize those Rockies. I think this should be made clear and benefit the Alberta Tourism..Wyoming should not get all the credit for those amazing scenes...make this CLEAR before any Oscars are awarded. The Acting was superb and the delicate subject handled beautifully. Why weren't BOTH men due for 'Call-Up'? I find myself thinking about the issues throughout the day and pondering the dilemma. Having many Gay friends...who consider this a very SAD movie I wonder now if there are not many men hiding their preference in marriages and lifestyles. It could open some wounds and hurt many women to find out this truth. But this subject needed to be shown...bravo once again ""Proulx's work.",Brokeback Mountain

2070,wrccab,Brokeback Mountain Best Picture 2006,10,20 March 2006,"In my opinion, the Academy Awards screwed up and awarded Best picture to the wrong movie. Without question in my mind and in many others, Brokeback Mountain was THE best picture of the year. Truly an outstanding movie with fine performances by Ledger and Gyllenhaal. When watching their performances, it is easy to get lost in the love that they show for each other and to sympathize with their characters. Society put them in the positions that they found themselves and society prevented them from being who they truly were. The universality of this movie is Love. This isn't just a gay cowboy movie; in fact they are ranch hands and not cowboys. You will be drawn into the picture and it will haunt your very soul as you will recognize the truth of the movie.",Brokeback Mountain
2071,UKBeefy,Not convinced,7,21 January 2006,I was slightly disappointed by this film...I had heard the rave reviews and heard of friends leaving cinemas in tears or being unable to take their mind off the film days later...Well I got no such reaction. Yes it is beautifully shot and their are some tightly acted scenes but I was not completely convinced. The early part of the film to me has some noticeable problems to me....When u first see both actors they look like models waiting for a casting....honestly are we to believe that these trim absurdly good looking guys with perfect skin are actually slightly rough neck cowboys...dressed in extremely clean new looking clothes that fitted perfectly....just did not seem convincing...Also I think the initial flowering of their attachment up on the mountain did not convince me either...Frankly I don't know other gay men who have made out as if they are trying to fight to the death...frankly in the privacy of the mountain one assumes they would have been more human and tender once they realised the feeling was mutual....also the sex scene to me is practically an impossibility and unrealistic as a first gay encounter...IE to go from kissing to successful penetrative sex where they already take assumed roles in about 10 seconds. Ask any gay friend and they will say their first time was nothing like that and never so quick.So good but not that good.,Brokeback Mountain
2072,dmgurley,"not sure what a spoiler is, but if a spoiler is someone discussing scenes, then I am guilty",8,21 January 2006,"I loved the movie. What a love story this is. It kinda haunts you after you leave the theater. The movie was well made and the scenery was fantastic. This is a love story that transcends gender and makes one believe in the absolute of true love. The characters of Jack and Ennis are very believable and one truly understands their love for one another. I would definitely see this movie again. I thought, however that the scene where Ennis gets the last card from Jack and then is on the phone to his wife was a bit vague and a little hard to follow. I'm not sure what a ""spoiler"" is, but if this is what I did here, I apologize",Brokeback Mountain
2073,potentialcolours,"A touchy subject for sure, but a must see",8,21 January 2006,"A touchy subject for sure, but one I'm convinced takes place more often than anyone would ever admit, both male and female situations.Brokeback Mountain dares to elaborate on the hidden purity of a forbidden love between two males who hesitate at first to fall prey to its grip. After swallowing the hook, line, sinker and pole of such a bond, the two young men, Jack and Ennis, cultivate this new-found territory in secret and suffer the consequences of an unforgiving public, family and friends.Tall green trees, rushing rivers, unlimited blue skies and plenty of incredible scenery make this movie a delight for the outdoorsman's eye and a dream for the anxious city-slicker.The characters are convincing throughout the movie which is 2 hours 23 minutes long and manage to make the audience laugh more than I expected within the first half. As expected, the latter half of the movie squeezes emotion and pain from each heart exposed to its illicit and controversial subject matter.Destined to be considered ground breaking material based on its incredibly positive response from both the industry and the general public, this movie is definitely worth the money spent just to view something we are taught to avoid watching on the screen--let alone experience.",Brokeback Mountain

I left the theater doors, holding back as a walked through the crowded sidewalks of downtown Mill Valley, till I got to my car, closed the door, and wept. This was an unexpectedly powerful love story. My heart still aches for the characters depicted in this uncanny romance. Brokeback mountain is not for the weak of heart or close-minded, but definitely well-deserving of its critically acclaimed splendor. I was skeptical of heath ledger and his counterpart to pull off a convincing cowboy. I left with a greater respect for both actors. Being homosexual myself, I was affected on a very personal level by this tragic love story. This will be a movie I never forget. Leaving the theater was like leaving my own funeral. It left me with feelings and emotions I forgot still existed. Dramatic and moving, but definitely wonderful.",Brokeback Mountain

It touched me in so many ways and i couldn't stop crying at the end! i give major props to Ang Lee and to Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal for their performances, they were so into the film and made it feel like you knew them personally. I'm a huge fan of Jake Gyllenhaal's and this was his best performance i've ever seen, Heath Ledger was absolutely incredible as well. this was by far the most romantic and sweetest movie i've seen in a VERY long while. i will definitely be seeing this film many other times when it's out on DVD!",Brokeback Mountain

This film is so beautifully crafted, from the haunting musical score, the breathtaking cinematography, the slow deliberate pace in direction and above all, remarkable acting from a perfect cast of actors. I have never been so emotionally touched by a film. There are so many layers to this tragic story, multiple viewings are recommended.Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are outstanding. Their understated performances build throughout the film. At no time did I feel like they were acting. Every word and gesture seemed natural-nothing forced or untrue. From the first frame I was pulled into this heartbreaking story of love found/love lost. The supporting cast is excellent as well. Not one weak link. Each actor has their moment in the sun. What an incredible achievement by director Ang Lee.By the end of the film I was emotionally crippled. I understood their motives, shared their grief, and mourned their loss.

I was completely disappointed when I finally convinced my friends we had seen everything but this movie. I walked into it with high expectations and the knowledge that by the time the movie was over my friends will have wondered why we hadn't seen it sooner. Sadly, I could not be more wrong. Don't let me mislead you it was a nice story line with true emotion and pain. However, it seemed like the only thing keeping me going was the cinematography. I loved the scenic shots the landscape and location was gorgeous.

However by far the largest crowd gasping and morning and tears from me and probably others was when Jack was murdered, the victim of a vicious hate crime. This has been underplayed I think and the overall sadness of the beautiful movie climaxed at that moment for me. I do not understand the incredible inhumanity to man that occurs even today! For me, it was hard to understand the total thought process of Ennis except for the love he had for his little girls. I would not have given up the chance for love like that except for my children.I did think some editing of the movie would have improved it. For example the last Jack scene before his murder was shown with a mustache and just before, the clean shaved Jack.But I drove 120 miles to see it and it was well worth the time!",Brokeback Mountain

The argument was good, however the artists (including Ledger...) did a poor job! The most stupid thingin the movie is the ridiculous way as Ledger tries to change his voice talking as John Wayne (cowboy voice), even my sister that is his fan got disappointed!! About the theme, i know it's a controversial theme, however i've seen better films about this theme (only Almodovar has 2 or 3 about it...)and i liked them. Broke Back really disappointed me... I will not say as it ends, but if you repair the tragic moment that changes the movie (almost in the end) was told by the wife of the other cowboy.

Ang Lee has created a cinematic masterpiece, haunting in its agonizing realism. this is a film that trancends the mundane and elevates the soul to higher spheres. if you never see another film in your lives, go and see brokeback mountain, it will teach you the nature of true,ever lasting and tormenting love!",Brokeback Mountain

I tend to be more of a horror fan, so was not looking forward to seeing this film having been railroaded into seeing it with my daughter. How wrong can one be? This is a wonderful story of love forbidden, love stolen and love lost. Ledger and Gyllenhaal play parts I would have expected of neither of them when you consider you are following the sorts of characters you find in A Knight's Tale and Bubble Boy! They managed to portray a moving, stirring, thought provoking performance that left my heart bleeding for them both in the unjustness of their situation.

I also hope that Heath Ledger wins Best Actor. He did an amazing job playing Ennis del Mar in the movie. I can't stop thinking about the scenes where Ennis and Jack show their love for each other. The first 20 minutes or so were a little boring. I was waiting for someone to have a conversation with somebody. Then after Ennis and Jack's sex scene, the story takes off. They ignore each other for a few days, but they realize what they got going is more than just a ""one-shot thing"". After they part ways at the end of the summer they both break down and start crying. That really got to me. My little sister leaned over and asked why Heath's character was crying so much. I told her it's because he realized how much he loved Jack and he's upset because he may never see him again. But nothing can stop true love. Over the next 20 year they may annual visit to Brokeback together. This is a true love story.",Brokeback Mountain

The performances are so real that you get swept away right into the film. The way the story flips back and forth between true love and happiness and the ""real world"" is just mind boggling. To have such an intense love for someone but never to be able to realize it...Ang Lee portrays this perfectly and heart wrenchingly. The ending left me numb...wow is all I can really say.

Priscilla Queen of the Desert fitted my life perfectly when i was 18, all camp and spangles, whereas now, Brokeback captures everything that we have felt, said, did or wished we had had courage enough to do in our lives. This is a film that shows how things should be, but more often than not how they actually are, one side convinced of their love for another, the other side struggling to come to terms with it. This is truly a milestone film, completely true to the plot, not overly graphic, the sexual scenes that are included are there to show either the raw hunger between the characters at the beginning of the relationship, or the tender intimacy as their journey progresses. The fact that these scenes are executed with a searing honesty and huge emotion is just another facade to the huge talents that are Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger. An instant classic!!",Brokeback Mountain

This film evoked so many emotions and feelings - passion, lust, love, betrayal, forgiveness, and sense of loss to list a few. You know a movie is sensational when you leave the theatre and think about it for days. From the beginning of the movie you are drawn in by the amazing talent and superb acting of Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall. Kudos to them for bringing such an honest portrayal and life to such a beautiful story. The story itself is rich with layers and propels you to the simplest of things - love and longing to be loved. Regardless of how you feel about homosexuality this movie is so much more than the obvious depiction in which people who have not seen the film described it - as that ""gay cowboy movie"". Everyone should see this film regardless of how you may feel about homosexuality you will be leaving the theatre feeling that this film is so much more than ""a gay cowboy movie"".

Ennis and Jack, the two main characters, are thrown together in the summer of '63, tending to sheep on Brokeback Mountain. One thing leads to another and both are forever changed. I know some have completely oversimplified this movie as a ""gay cowboy"" movie, but that is so far from the core of it. BBM is a love story, an epic one, which has never been done in gay themed movies (usually movies with gay characters as the focal point do not span anywhere near 20 years). It deservingly is the most acclaimed film of the year and should have been named best picture of the year by the academy, but who cares what they think. The performances are amazing. Heath Ledger is breathtaking. He totally became Ennis Del Mar. The same can be said for Jake Gyllenhaal, who is brilliant as Jack Twist. The supporting cast is also great. I would recommend this movie to anyone, not just fellow members of the gay community, but those who enjoy a movie that is heartbreakingly beautiful and will move you to tears.",Brokeback Mountain

The love story from the book was carefully managed by a great producer. The actors and locations couldn't have been better. It was a subliminal invitation to the American people to be tolerant, understanding and respectful. It opens a window in conservative minds that reduce the magic of ""LOVE"" to a grammatical and politically correct phrase. The courage of this movie producer and his ability to portray the love between two men is Oscar winning at best. This movie with beautiful scenery and beautiful actors will lead many more to come with controversial issues on screen. Enjoy this movie and get educated through out its message.",Brokeback Mountain

Since then it has affected everything I've done in the past 4 days. When I sit at work, talk to workmates, speak to family, eat my meals, lie in bed at night, it is there on my mind.I've seen it twice since and although I am still so sad I am beginning to feel that there's some sort of hope in the end for Ennis.In the moment he agrees to go to Alma Jnr's wedding he opens up to her for the first time, asking her about love. I feel this is a redemption for him and hope that:1. He'll realise that they and their mother loved him too. 2. That he'll maybe make a life which will include Alm Jnr & Jenny 3 That he'll make his peace with Alma Snr 4. That he'll visit Jacks Mother again.I don't think he'll look for another Jack, I think that was his one true love.It saddens me to think about it all , but I get hope when I read the many warm and heartfelt comments on this and other sites. (just take a look around the net and you'll see gay, straight, male , female old and young people saying how they were moved to tears by this film. I think in time this film will be hailed as the one that changed so many people's perceptions about not only gay love but LOVE in general.

2090,ajflyhi,Orientation....my take.,10,29 January 2006,"Oh how to make comment amongst so many, and not sound trite or repetitive and indeed, disrespectful to others views. After reading so many takes on this wonderful movie, I'm repeatedly drawn to a quote of Annie Prouix herself which I would like to share at this point; '' How different readers take the story is a reflection of their own personal values, attitudes, hang-ups. It is my feeling that a story is not finished until it is read, and that the reader finishes it through his or her own life experience, prejudices, world view and thoughts''. My initial reaction to the movie though incredibly impressed was marred by what I thought to be a huge deficiency of tangible expression of love between the 2 men. Even before seeing the movie I sensed that reading the short story might not be a bad idea. So, the next day I did just that and returned to the cinema for a second showing. Whilst I'm not saying that to read the book beforehand is essential for all, in my case, it made all the difference. Instead of dictating my wishes on the storyline I was able to sit back and drink in all the riches of the performance, cinematography, screenplay, sound etc. So many questions answered, a better understanding of the subtleties of text and direction, all came about from knowing the story. Now, whenever I revisit the film I see a myriad of detail that put this story into a sharper focus making it the most profound cinematic experience in my lifetime. ( I'm 53 and remember only 'Maurice' making me want to see a movie re homosexual love again ). And now I look back at the movie and have some comments that I would like to share. The discussion raging about the true orientation of the 2 men is answered in the repressive atmosphere of the times and my own experience. ( tx Annie for the prompt).I can see them both going thru puberty and in their own ways and timing discovering their attraction for boys and not girls. In Jack's case, a progression not greatly marred or scuppered by any event, allowing him to become an adult man sexually attracted to other men and who knows, losing his virginity a couple of years or so before this story begins. As for Ennis, the traumatic experience of being shown the mutilated corpse of one of the 2 ranchers puts a ton weight of fear and dread upon him concerning urges that by the age of 9 when the event happens may already have begun. I believe his orientation is established by the time we pick up the story but it's buried so deep that only someone special will be able to lift the lid.And that orientation isn't necessarily all homosexual but sufficient for the connection between them to happen as it does. After the drunken sing song and Ennis' claim on entry to heaven based on having not yet done anything to deserve otherwise, we see a dropping of guard sufficient for Jake to feel hopeful in something happening just around the corner and what must be a ground breaking instance of flirting or at least wishful thinking from Ennis. One of a few instances of mutual attraction that confound those who don't see the reason for them coming together in the first place. Ennis has opened up to Jack in a way that anybody knowing his character would not believe possible.At the point in the story when Ennis and jack trade places with the sheep tending and before their coming together Prouix writes ''They were respectful of each others opinions, each glad to have a companion where none had been expected. Ennis, riding against the wind back to the sheep in the treacherous, drunken light, thought he'd never had such a good time, felt he could paw the white out of the moon ''. Ennis came to Jack a virgin in so much more than sexual experience and Jack came to Ennis with enough same sex experience to know that that was his lot and he was gonna go for it. Added to all this a chemistry that no amount of fine prose can define, the basic requirement to a relationship that was gonna go through all that it did. There should be no surprise at the lustful passion of their final coming together and Ennis' subsequent confusion before returning to him who had just lifted that lid albeit just a tad. On a personal note, I remember the ecstasy of my first kiss with another man, the subsequent fleeing after the pleasure and the accompanying fear and confusion but it was I who returned for more and without looking back. I fear that space prevents me from rambling further so would close with the hope that the effect this movie will have on society will be profound and long reaching 'though my pessimistic view on the improvement of human nature tells me not to hold my breath. In a quote from E M Forster's 'Maurice' read 'the world' for England;''....England has always been disinclined to accept human nature''.",Brokeback Mountain
2091,sassy_irish_gal,not sure what all the hype is all about,3,24 January 2006,I saw BBM this past weekend and Iam still trying to figure out what all the fuss is about . This movie was BORING on so many levels to me and my husband. In the middle of it I found myself apologizing for insisting that we see the film. I also found myself wishing that I could leave and sneak into something else. The only reason we did not leave was I was hoping something more interesting would happen and I would understand why so many people hold this movie with such high acclaims For the life of me I can't imagine this winning best picture of the year at the upcoming Oscars. I do have to comment that the scenery and the cinematography was great,Brokeback Mountain
2092,lexic2,"Love conquers all, but Ang Lee conquers Love!",9,1 February 2006,"Like millions of people before me who have come to appreciate the beauty of Latin maxims, simple yet elegant at the same time, I, too, have added a few such famous sayings to my cherished memories over the years. One of such is: ""magna est veritas, et praevalebit"", and the other more popular one being: ""omnia vincit amor"". The profound truths in these pithy expressions are so inviting and eternally fresh that any attempt for explanation not only seem superfluous, but dilutes and degrades as well, regardless the age, gender, ethnic or cultural background of the recipient.Never did I have any doubts about these categorical truths or their universal applicability until I had the opportunity to watch Brokeback Mountain on the big screen. While the surface story of the romance between the uniquely star-crossed same-sex lovers is as plain as the broad day light, (indeed, a few movie-goers and critics did seem heinously satisfied at arriving such cruelly over-simplified conclusion to pack home with), it is the undercurrent that adds texture and charm to its wide appeal. Thought-provoking and growing concern for humanity and the human condition are not among the first and definitely not the easiest that millions of movie-goers can shake off as they drive home. For many, the nostalgia for Brokeback Mountain will come back to haunt them much too soon and lingers on much longer than they ever thought possible.So, what is Brokeback Mountain after all? Simply put, it's a movie that love is conquered and lovers are consumed and all these is made possible only under the careful direction and watchful eyes of Ang Lee, an amazing individual whose appreciation for humanity and ability to transform that appreciation faithfully into the silver screen will unequivocally peg himself among that rare species of gifted few who had ever bestowed a modern Olympia into the hearts of the viewing public.Many have expressed a view that it is no other than the harsh physical and social environment in the unforgiving heartland of Wyoming, the ultimate home to rural homophobia, that is, directly or indirectly, responsible for this tragic results of Ennis and Jack's romance, yet the story and movie have transcended far above and beamed through all boundaries for an individual's loss of love. This gripping story, therefore, testifies vulnerability of mankind in general. And what a vulnerability it has depicted! These two poor cowpokes, with limited education, limited vision for life, are doomed from the very beginning to have a life of limited success in such an environment at the very best, yet now it is their unique love story that will resonate with the majority of public, forever. Both men and especially Ennis, appeared muscular, yet such a shell is no match for their predestined hardscrabble lifestyle as ranch hand or rodeo guy. Does that mean both should just recognize their fate, admit that they are socially and economically disadvantaged and live out their lives the best they can while sticking to the juggernaut of social norms? Many in similar situations probably would have, yet they choose the hard way, always retreating to the Brokeback Mountain, the only refuge on earth they know. And the price they paid? A life under shadows with much added uneasiness. There is simply no royal road or easy way out this extremely unsatisfied situation, for either of them.Ang Lee, or for that matter, E. Annie Proulx as well, doesn't even pretend to have a ready answer for us mortals. All he did was to present this believable story as realistic as possible, leaving no stones unturned, nothing more and nothing less, no special effect, no dizzy plot line, just the uncluttered story itself, simple yet elegant in its own right. In the end, he has achieved few have ever aspired or begun. An unbiased, unique story that most people can relate and resonate, on many different levels. While ultimately entertaining, it is no less educational. Never claimed to be uplifting, Brokeback Mountain does help to shackle off ingrained biases in more than a handful few. As far as the art form of motion picture goes, by now, Lee is definitely a true master, versatile, considerate, with piercingly keen observations and a big warm heart.In just one scoop, my once unwavering faith in ""omnia vincit amor"" is now completely smashed by Brokeback Mountain, and I have no qualms about it, for, it's always the second half of this maxim, ""nos et cedamus amori"" that really counts!",Brokeback Mountain
2093,Kantblue,"Beautiful, deeply moving, well written and acted.",10,25 January 2006,"Well I finally got to make my own mind up, I really didn't expect to be impressed, I've seen plenty of other films that have been praised by the critics and been unimpressed by them (21 grams, anyone?) This film really is EXTRAORDINARY, and the oddest thing is I can't really say why. Although all the parts that make up the film, the script, scenery, acting, soundtrack etc are all excellent, somehow they fit together to make a film far greater than you would expect.By the time the film finished, I felt like I had been hit by a sledgehammer, I couldn't even think straight (no pun intended). I'm considering going again, but actually I don't know if I dare. Crazy reaction, its only a film! Don't let the ""Gay Cowboy"" tag put you off, this film is about far more than that simplistic view. Go See.",Brokeback Mountain
2094,vbmichelle,Adored this film!,9,24 January 2006,"I absolutely loved this film! Honestly, there was not one thing that I would have changed about it. I didn't think that I would like it, which is usually the case when I see a movie that has gotten such rave reviews. I'm very happy to report that this time I agreed with the critics and loved every minute of this film. I loved the cast, the cinematography, the love and passion the two man shared, and most of all, I loved that I cannot stop thinking how it all ended. I share the thoughts of another IMDb commentary I read that stated the movie still 'haunts' them.This film is a love story, nothing more, nothing less. It makes no difference at all that the two people in love are men. In fact, I think it made the film more interesting because they didn't play the stereotypical male same sex couples that you often see portrayed in TV and other films. So many people have said, 'Oh, is that the movie with the two gay cowboys..."" The truth is, at least for me, is that you get so involved in the story and the couples love for one another that their gender becomes irrelevant. I highly recommend this film. I hope that this film helps human kind see that same sex relationships can have as much love and passion as heterosexual relationships can. I have known, for many years, that love is love, regardless of gender. This film says this so beautifully.",Brokeback Mountain
2095,juliocolio,Absolute best movie ever !!!,10,24 January 2006,On the 25th I will be seeing Brokeback mountain for the 3rd time. It is absolutely the best Hollywood movie ever made. Ang Lee made a masterpiece that will hopefully continue to open heart about homosexuality. It's not a choice and Ang Lee really demonstrated it well by using 2 talented actors.......Jake and Heath. Congratulations i'm speechless and nothing will ever top this LOVE story masterpiece....... You feel the characters and you swear they were in love and nothing less. No movies ever meet such standards. For all the Christians who hate this movie and helped get this banned it ain't stopping nobody cause it's you guys thats betraying God for not loving people for who they are..................

This film has showed us the problems which would occurred in the traditional culture. Both of the Ennis and Jack wanted to get their love and didn't realized because of the religion and something others etc... I appreciated that all the things appear in this film such as the sheep, the sight, the actors and actresses. They all really do a good job and let me fly high. All of that elements above that i have mentioned in this film are excellent and unbelievable. If the DVD is released i will get to buy it immediately. I must tell to the others who do not see the film. If you don't see this film your life will be regretted for it ..... It is the best film that i have seen",Brokeback Mountain

And the story does seem to give a strong sense of hope and inspiration for audiences. Throughout the film, there are scenes of men being intimate. Some might find themselves feeling uncomfortable at times.The movie seems to be really quiet. There is very little background music; always just the sound of silence or the running of water... The ending keeps us wondering a little. Especially with Anne Hathaway's response to ""Ennis"" when he called.The film's message was clear in illustrating the hardship of living as a homosexual back then due to the narrow-mindedness of the public.",Brokeback Mountain
2099,petemcrod-1,Don't bother,1,25 January 2006,"One of the truly over-hyped movies of today. This movie was not even a good story from a magazine. I wish I could get my money back but that isn't about to happen. So I lost $6.50 and 2 hours of my life. The acting is bad, the make up is bad. The only good thing in the movie was the Mountains. They're in Canada by the way so the movie about the US wasn't even in the US. The one moment in the film that truly was moving was the final sequence when his daughter asks him to come to her wedding and he agrees other then that this movie really didn't do anything for me. Although in retrospect I really enjoyed Randy Quaid and loved it when he lit into Jack for worry more about making time with Ennis then he was about taking care of the sheep - That made me laugh out loud.",Brokeback Mountain
2100,annanevskaja,Not just a movie about gay cowboys,10,11 March 2006,"...but so much more. Two cowboys get to know each other herding sheep at the Brokeback Mountain. Soon they discover that there is more than just friendship between them. But conservatism, social constraints, common values and opinions make life hard for the two young men who have discovered socially intolerable love for each other. Still, they are not able to let go what grew between them at the Brokeback Mountain, trying to lead a ""normal"" life but being haunted by their feelings. But the intolerance does not only come from outside. Rather, the prejudices the both men grew up with themselves do not disappear. Thats how a decade-long hide-and-seek begins, along with self-doubts, denial and desperation...Before seeing it I was not sure whether I would like it, not only because there is an incredible hype being made about that movie but also because I doubted the ability of the main actors to credibly picture gay men. And even if they could, I doubted that, even though being tolerant about homosexuality myself, I would be touched by that kind of love story. I was proved wrong. That movie is one of the kind you do not get to see that often: Pittoresque, emotional, touching, and all that without being cheesy or corny. A quiet, gentle story about two people falling in love, absolutely believable, because honest and deep. Definitely worth seeing!!!",Brokeback Mountain
2101,phrekey_gurl,I found only reality crying in the movie theater.,10,25 January 2006,"I have never cried in a movie theater before, but last night, in the packed theater, I cried more than I have in a great while. The reality of this movie, I am certain, has moved every single person that has seen it. Heath and Jake were amazing to say the least, I personally felt the passion, and because I believe there is something deeper in all of us that can really connect with the characters in this movie, I recommend it EVERYONE. When I first walked into the theater I was a little worried because my friends and I were the only people under the age of 30, the audience consisted mostly of older couples between the ages of 50 and 70 I would guess. It was the most moving thing to leave the theater seeing tears in the eyes of people I was sure would be disgusted. In my opinion this is the most original and most memorable love story of our time.",Brokeback Mountain
2102,lane70118,Two men find love/obsession on a remote mountain in 1963 and the effects follow them through life,8,25 January 2006,"I just saw Brokeback Mountain yesterday and have been digesting it all day. Of course a romance between two handsome cowboys in today's society is going to receive some significant press, and I can only hope the power of the themes in the story are not underscored by the obvious ""its high time we've seen a good gay romance/drama"" aspect of the film.What I found most interesting about the film is that I really identified with and felt more for the supporting characters than I did for the leads. Though Heath ledger has been heralded for this role, I did not find myself feeling sympathetic toward him for most of the film. Of course this is what makes him so compelling of a hero for me. I really got to know him, as they say, and my feelings about him evolved as his character did. I think therein lies the genius of Ang Lee.I must say that Jake Gylenhaal was well cast in the role Jack Twist, but once again, i just couldn't get my heart around his character for the majority of the film, and then I did, and then he disappointed me...just like life. I think we can all be happy or not that a fine well-made film was made depicting a gay romance; but the real magic of the film is not that it is gay, but rather that it seems as if these people were honestly depicted, and that isn't always easy.As far as breakout performances, I think the young lady who played Alma Jr. was wonderful. I think she was played by Anna Pacquin, and she did such a stunning job. Also Michelle Williams was wonderful, and the character for whom I felt the most for the majority of the film. Anne Hathaway was terrific. This was a far cry from Drenovia, or however you spell it.There are things I would have wanted to go other ways, but who doesn't wish they could write life how they wanted? In any case, it was a great movie and I hope if you haven't seen it or if you have, that you will look beyond the hype and see the soul. Make your decision then.If you have any comments or film recommendations, please email them to me.",Brokeback Mountain
2103,emma-78592,Fourteen years later,10,26 October 2019,"I've waited fourteen years to see this film. And it was so much less of a sentimental romance than I had expected. Powerful is the story, powerful the acting. Understated and raw. When the credits came on my heart broke and I can't even say why I cried. Because great art touches us in ways where words fall short. Great storytelling always lets the story unfold in the hearts of the receiver. What an accomplishment this film is.",Brokeback Mountain
2104,kimmiekm,Amazing,10,26 January 2006,"I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that kept me thinking, remembering, and hoping days later. This movie is an amazingly heartbreaking love story. Anyone who thinks that it is just gay propaganda has no idea what they are talking about. This is one of the most wonderful love stories I've ever seen - gay or straight. Jake and Enis' love story is heart wrenching, yet there is never a doubt in your mind that they are truly in love and you continually hope for their happiness together. Everyone can learn something from this movie; it is one of the most amazing, heartfelt, and wonderful movies I've ever seen.",Brokeback Mountain
2105,Stasss,Compelling Love Story,10,26 January 2006,"One of the best gay themed movies I have seen in a long time. Okay so now I've gone and done it. I've invoked the G word but don't let that scare you. Sure this movies deals with a theme that in many parts of the world is still seen as controversial but it is so much more than that. This is a story about a love that is so impossible but still manages to become such an important part of live. It shows you a glimmer of what real love is and how important it is in life. It also shows what happens when you decide to let the world tell you how to live your life. So far the story.The locations and sets in this movie are super as are the shots that serve to show you how beautiful the surroundings are. The use of color and aerial shots are just spot on. Although there were some small hiccups with the camera work (guess they forgot the steady cam) the overall result came together very nicely.Jake as well as Heath have to be commended for their stellar performances; they managed to portray a deep and undying but painful love with such intensity and realism you rarely ever see from such young actors. The fact that the 2 straight actors agreed to play such a controversial role and pull it of this perfectly gave the movie that extra dimension. Acting for the love of acting (or an Oscar :-)) All I can wonder now is what happens next? Will they continue doing great movies that might not always be the big blockbuster kind or are they going for the money? I hope it's the former.Now who did the better acting? It would have to be Heath although given everything Jake does come very close. I guess this was just a winning combo. One thing is for sure, I'll be keeping a close eye on both of them and if you want a tip; see October Sky where Jake gives another great performance.",Brokeback Mountain

2107,k_karanikas,A nemesis of love,10,26 January 2006,"The film has been a revelation to watch and the book had been a magical treat to read in the past. Ang Lee has produced a masterpiece that ought to be put amongst the best movies ever made. The subject is definitely a contributing factor considering that portrayal of the two gay men has been exceptional and non judgemental, which is usually the case on US movies and gay roles -was there a kiss in Philadelphia? Despite this the movie is stylistically and technically brilliant, inspiring and inspired. The pace was established immediately and sustained throughout allowing for a most comfortable journey in the lives of the two heroes. Gay love story or not the movie delivers a poignant representation of true love - ""a force of nature"" - very cleverly employed as the tag line.... The complex emotions of the characters are presented with clarity and unbiased to allow them to have their own. It is hard not to sympathise with everyone but for the society that geared the sequence of actions and events in the lives of these mid-westerners. A utter visual delight that becomes an imparting experience lingering in ones thoughts with an extraordinary warmth. A must see!",Brokeback Mountain
2108,kudzudaddy,"Haunting, Unforgettable",10,26 January 2006,"All has been said, I won't repeat the superlatives, this is a great and noble film. I wish only to speak of its effect on me. Many others have mentioned it: unable to sleep, a scene that jumps into your head at the most inopportune time triggering tears, that feeling you've been somehow ennobled by grief. I saw it in New York on December 19. I did not cry, I was too afraid of missing something. leaving the theatre, the night was very cold and windy and dealing with the cold took all my concentration. I spoke glowingly of it to friends, urging them to see it. So far, pretty normal. After all, it's just a film. Almost two weeks later, I was drawn to the BBM website and to the comments on the film. One writer mentioned a scene, I forget which one, and I started to cry... not just tears but great wheezing sobs... I cried myself to sleep for Ennis and Jack. The next day I went back to see it again and was again spellbound... Since then I've indulged a quiet obsession with the film. I read every scrap written about it, and every comment posted anywhere from those who have seen it. I feel a bit like the Richard Dreyfuss character in ""Close Encounters,"" not knowing how or why but only that I care so deeply. Nothing like this has ever happened to me in my life -- and I'm 60 years old. I look for an explanation -- I am a gay man... could that be it? Old and lonely and subject to cheap emotional tricks? I know better... there are no tricks in that hard and unsentimental screenplay. Just a story. I've seen thousands... none has ever grabbed me like this. I half wonder if there aren't some demonic subliminal images inserted every 10 frames to rob me of my will. I'm grasping now.... I never had an Ennis -- or a Jack... but now I do. I have no clever answer for this phenomenon... but I'm grateful for it. I don't know why.",Brokeback Mountain
2109,tangcy6,It's very difficult for a fast-food lover to appreciate slowly-cooked delicacy,10,8 February 2006,"I think this movie is one of the greatest ever produced.Some people complained that they were bored to death due to its slow pace and lack of dialog. My response is that it's very difficult for a fast-food lover to appreciate slowly-cooked delicacy.You have to see this movie not only with your eyes, ears, but also with your heart. Paying attention to details will help you appreciate the purpose of each scene which might seem unnecessary. For instance, there are two scenes about Ennis's two little daughters. When Ennis comes home one day, Alma asks him to take care of the sick baby. While he is trying to pacify the crying baby in a small and dark bed-room, the elder daughter comes to hold his leg and cries loudly. Another scene is that Ennis takes his two daughters to the grocery store and hands them over to Alma who is working there in front of a cash register. The elder daughter makes a mess by accident that embarrasses Alma. Ang Lee portrays a young man who is loaded with family burden. The dull family life is the reality in contrast to the carefree dream-like life Ennis and Jack share in a secluded beautiful mountain.Unfulfilled love is always beautiful as it never gets eroded by the crude reality.If you have a sensitive mind, don't miss BBM which will leave room for you to interpret. It is a thought-provoking film rarely found in Hollywood.",Brokeback Mountain

It was so touching and stirred up emotions to the point I was speechless. The cinematography was absolutely beautiful. It makes me want to go out west to witness that beauty first hand. It is such a well done movie. Everything about it; the writing, the directing, the acting. I adore Heath and Jake for taking on these roles, they did an absolutely fabulous, incredible job.

2111,jimvice,The classic theme of an impossible love,10,26 January 2006,"""Brokeback Mountain"" is a beautiful and moving variation on the classic theme of an impossible love. To say it is about ""gay cowboys"" is comparable to saying that ""Tristan and Isolde"" or ""Casablanca"" is about ""adultery"" or that ""Romeo and Juliet"" or Mishima's ""Spring Snow"" is about ""pre-marital sex."" The acting is superb. The stars in ""Good Night and Good Luck"" and in ""Capote"" played well-known characters excellently. Heath Ledger has created what deserves to become a well-known character. Ledger's Ennis just might live with Bogart's Rick in film immortality (though the different film endings probably militate against it). The more knowledgeable Jack (see the brief mention of sins) can at least imagine escape from circumstance by retreat to his parents' ranch and can contemplate alternatives to Ennis (""I wish I knew how to quit you"") with the rodeo clown, the Mexican, or the foreman. The inarticulate Ennis cannot escape his obligations to his daughters and is reduced to rage, tears, and despair, with no alternative to Jack. Postscript: Now having read the short story and the screenplay and seen the movie additional times, I am even more impressed with Heath Ledger's acting achievement in ""creating"" Ennis. As Annie Proulx writes in her commentary on the making of the movie, ""Heath Ledger... knew better than I how Ennis felt and thought, whose intimate depiction of that achingly needy ranch kid builds with frightening power."" It is additionally striking how Jake Gyllenhaal and the other actors all add depth to what the writers of both story and screenplay gave them in only suggestive sketch.",Brokeback Mountain

2113,marshallherd2005,An excellent movie that everyone should see,10,2 February 2006,"This movie was released on Dec 9th 2005 with all the hype and press of any other movie. You would hear people talking about the ""gay cowboy"" movie and are you going to see it? Most straight people would say no politely though some would say hell no or something more offensive. Give the hype and press about this movie, I think the only thing to say after reading all of the bad reviews about it is plain. If you don't want to see a movie about homosexuals, don't go this this one. When ""The passions of Christ"" came out not long ago, I didn't rush right out to see it. Mainly because all the churches and religious right-wingers were saying how grand and wonderful that movie was. If I needed to know the story about Jesus and how he suffered, I would pick up my Bible and read it. I didn't need Mel Gibson telling me his version of what happened. People want to protest and boycott things that are different and maybe not their viewpoints in life but if they don't want to watch a wonderfully made movie about true love between two grown adult individuals then just don't watch it. NO ONE is forcing you to go and pay to watch it. I read one review where someone stated after watching part of the movie they got up and left because they figured out what it was about. Well DUH, I think the media had covered that one pretty much well in advance. I read a review that the people who made this movie were the same people who didn't love this country and family and things to that nation. Well, I didn't make the movie but I loved the movie and have seen it a few times with various friends. I love this great and wonderful country that allows us the freedoms and rights that to not only make a movie that might be somewhat controversial but also allows us to voice our opinions in praise or denial of said movie. A great philosopher once said ""I might not agree with your beliefs, but I will defend your right to voice them"". I think this movie will changes minds about love and realize that people no matter their gender, race, sexual orientation, can and do fall in love and that everyone has that inalienable and unequalled right.",Brokeback Mountain
2114,TBrooks22,Love's Mountain,9,27 January 2006,"I saw Brokeback Mountain tonight,1/27/2006. We all have Brokeback Mountain love stories. As the tag line indicates, Love is a Force of Nature, and the forces that be weave all of us into the entanglements of love. I hear Oscar buzzing now, Heath Ledger has delivered his best performance to date. Jake Gylenhaal ought to get a vote for best supporting actor. The Golden Globes definitely indicated this film's strength among viewers and the Hollywood Foreign Press. Ennis Del Mar, Heath Ledger's character, will remind you of yourself or you'll recognize him as someone you know. Through his resolve, quiet strength, and unspoken emotion(s). It's a love story that has it's frailties and harsh realities. This film reminds all of us that love is the greatest force of all. And we all should hope to hold on to it once it finds us. The sweeping landscape of Montana (Alberta,Canada was a location shoot for the film) was as breathtaking as the love that grew between Jack and Ennis.",Brokeback Mountain
2115,normalcpl,Finally!,10,5 February 2006,"I finally got to see this movie! Had definite plans to travel out-of-town this weekend with hubby to see it, because I didn't think it would ever make it to our little conservative city in Central Illinois, but one of the local theaters finally got it.It was quite delicious, though it left me aching for more between the guys. Granted, there was not room for a lot of tenderness, because the passion was so bottled up, when it got out it often bordered on violence. My favorite scene(s) were two cuddlesone from love and one from passion and frustration (2nd night in the tent, and the clinch during their last meeting at Brokeback).I don't think Jack understood the depth of Ennis' love for him, and the suffering it caused him to resist that lovethough Ennis did everything he could to hide it (including from himself).The women were great. If only Alma could have leveled with Ennis right after she saw him kissing Jack, it might have spared everybody some heartachebut she was just as trapped by ignorance as he wasnot to mention, she loved him and was devastated to find out that he did not feel for her what she felt for him. And more trapped from a cultural standpoint, being a woman in a time when women had very little power.What did Ennis mean, at the very end of the movie, what he said, ""I swear""? I have my idea; I'd like to hear yours. Nice touch that Ennis' light-colored plaid shirt, which was originally inside Jack's denim, showed up in Ennis' ""closet"" on the outside. Not a continuity error, trust me.Did Jack's parents know the score? I say mom definitely did and was pretty sympathetic to the situation. Not sure about dad (though he was not nearly so sympathetic, in any case).I was amused/touched/ vindicated(?) by the amount of surreptitious crying going on in the theater. Granted, mostly women. There was such a load of tissues on the theater floor (and you hardly ever see tissues). I used several, too, but stuffed 'em in my purse.I cried, but I was not disappointed. The movie was very depressing in its depiction of poverty and intolerance, but it salvaged what is really important, and to me ultimately proved to be satisfying. Though love was not triumphant, it was true in, and to, the end.If Ennis could live his life over, he would do it differently. He knows what he has lost, and has learned from the experience, paradoxically proving this by deciding to be present at the wedding of a daughter he lovesand damn the torpedoes. Would that he could have done the same for Jack, while there was still time! I am getting the book, for sure, because I could not catch some of the dialog. Will need to see the movie in the theater again, tooand get the DVD.For the woman who said she wondered if she was weird because two men being loving turned her on, let me say, ""If you are weird, you have lots of company!"" I have been a fan of male/male relationships for 25 years, since the advent of ""slash"" fiction in media fandom (which I believe started with the classic Star Trek and K/S). For me, it is not mainly the sex (though that is by no means excluded!); it is the love and resulting vulnerability.And for you guys who might be thinking, ""Crap, my wife wants to see this thing, but why do I want to watch two guys making goo-goo eyes at each other?"" If for no other reason, because you are about 100% likely to ""get some"" afterwards. Love is love is love--and women like to watch it. I am off to grab hubby, and lead him into the bedroom. Wanna show him how great it feels to be able to love the person you love, without societal recrimination! LJS",Brokeback Mountain

I had never seen either of the two main actors before. About five minutes into the movie when Jake Gyllenaal appeared, I knew I had picked a winner!This movie is more then about the yearning of these two men for one another.

It has not been well received in my town. We are a state of homophobes who want to believe no cowboy could ever be gay. But I say to them, not to worry. The red neck, haters are more than represented. But I have to laugh every time I see a movie that supposedly takes place in Wyoming. Few people wear cowboy hats. Almost no cowboy wears a vest, but the one thing that bothers all of us Wyomingites, we do not have southern accents! We live in the northern part of the U.S. But it would be very difficult for a gay cowboy to come out in Wyoming. We are a very red state.",Brokeback Mountain
2119,mtleyden,A Perfect Example of How Critics Reviews Do Not Represent The Majority of Viewers,1,28 January 2006,"This is yet another film that the average moviegoer will leave feeling bewildered disappointed. I went because just about every critic and review raved about the film. Simply stated, its awful. I was expected at the very least a story of starcrossed lovers. Utterly slow moving, which didn't really matter in the end because it wasn't going anywhere, anyway. The first half of the movie is completely scenery with little dialog at all. I have to admit, I was praying the film would be discrete about any romantic scenes and to my horror they more resembled a violent prison rape scene which would make the likes of RuPaul blush and feel awkward. The film makes the same mistake that many do these days. They try to make the audience have some emotional reaction to the film by making it depressingly melancholy. This movie Falls into the category of films critics seem to love, but everyone else hates. Add this to the list which now includes, The English Patient and Lost in Translation.",Brokeback Mountain
2120,MrGoFaster,Best Gay movie Ever!!!!,10,28 January 2006,"I have to say that this is the first REALISTIC gay movie I've ever seen. It's the first time gay men weren't portrayed as nelly queens you laugh at, week & powerless victims, sex machines or dieing of aids. FINALLY, a movie that actually shows what it's like to be gay in rural America. So many times my lover & I have said that we felt like we felt exactly like these guys & had been trapped in the same situations in the past. It shows how gay men get trapped in a relationship with a woman just to keep up appearances to protect themselves from the wrath of the ignorant. I was extremely moved by the picture. This film is an instant classic & the line ""I'm not queer. I'm not queer either"" Is just as powerful & memorable as ""Luke I am your father"".We were disturbed by the reactions of the str8 audience laughing during the 2 scenes where the boss & wife secretly caught a peak at the men being gay. They all laughed as if that was funny. As a gay man I don't understand this reaction. I see nothing funny about 2 men in love that have to hide it from the world or risk being killed for it ""funny"". People are more prejudiced then they realize & this movie will help open there eyes that gay love is just as real as any other & not something to be minimized.For a movie of this magnitude to be this popular during the current administration renews my faith in the American people & the real social value of today's society despite what Washington would have us believe. This film is a must see movie, I'm going to tell every one I know to go see it, even Mom!",Brokeback Mountain
2121,sarah_weiner,Review of movie,10,29 January 2006,I recently saw this movie for the second time and it was really good. The first time I went to see the movie I thought okay this is going to be a gay cowboy movie but after seeing it I realized it beyond that to a love story about two people who despite the odds and the challenges love each other. Jake's character Jack and Heath's character Ennis did an amazing job portraying their characters.Jack's character with wanting to believe that he could be with Ennis and Ennis character being afraid of having a committed relationship and living with Jack. Even though Ennis didn't say a lot in the movie but what wasn't said really came through with his emotions and facial expressions. Seeing the movie a second time brought the movie more to life and I was able to pick up on things better than I did the first time around.It definitely opened my eyes to all the issues surrounding same sex relationships and the struggles and the heartache during a time period where it wasn't expected and it wasn't something that was done or even talked about. I thought both Jake and Health did any amazing job and really made you believe that love through time can last despite everything. I definitely recommend this movie.,Brokeback Mountain
2122,stevemcdonald_2000,Fantastic,10,29 January 2006,"This is not just any movie. It hits you squarely in the guts. Everyone came out of my theater sniffling. Everyone involved with this movie did a phenomenal job. Heath and Jake were amazing! For days afterward, i would breakdown and cry! The movie stirred me like nothing else ever has.Most of us have had a similar ""brokeback"" moment. Someone with whom we deeply were in love. Brought together by ""a force of nature""....that somehow went wrong. I miss mine.Thank you Brokeback Mountain for reminding me what i had...and what i look for.This movie, the director, Heath, Jake and Michelle all deserve Oscars!If you can only go to one movie this year, make it Brokeback Mountain...you will not regret it.",Brokeback Mountain
2123,naomi-abel,Beautiful,10,30 January 2006,"This film is still with me and I saw it three days ago! Jack and Enis have entered my heart and their story is residing there. This film is on my mind, if I start to think about certain scenes, I am so moved, that I am brought to tears. The more I think about it, the more I understand. This film's union of directing, cinematography, score, acting and writing comes together to create something that is sublime, brilliant, superb, haunting and absolutely beautiful! Brokeback Mountain is now one of my top three favorite films of all time, and with each passing day it's becoming clear that it's most likely to become my favorite. What a marvellous feat at story telling. I'm going to see it again later this week. Congratulations to all involved!",Brokeback Mountain
2124,palminteri,Such diametrically opposed opinions on this movie.,10,12 April 2006,"If I've learned anything about rating or making comments on this site about this movie, it's that one person will rave from the heart about the affects it had on them, and continues to have on them, even after months since first viewing it. Then, the next person will adamantly and vehemently find many, many faults with it, technically, acting wise, directing wise, so-called agenda wise, etc., referring to it as ""crap"", a waste of 2 hrs and 15 min.+ $8 to $10.I have, for good or bad, personalized this movie and everything about it and am hurt and disappointed that there are those who don't, won't, or can't share my enthusiasm and vigor for BBM.Now, I won't pretend to have any real sharp knowledge about the technical aspects of the production and I realize that everyone usually is not of the same opinion, and I respect that. I just know what I feel in my heart as a result of seeing this movie.With respect to the ""adultery"" criticism, I feel that if society had been different, the guys would not have had to marry the women at all, and if anyone was a victim of adultery and victims in general, it was Ennis and Jack. It could be viewed that they were committing adultery with the women, 'cause if truth be told, the guys were together first and would have, in my opinion, definitely been true to each other instead of the other way around.I've had to live a double life my whole life. Lying and saying one thing while living another. Some would say I've been a coward and maybe they're right. If not wanting to hurt my family and friends or being afraid to tell them because of all of the stigma during my life, then yes, I was a coward. But, I won't stand by now and listen to all of this lambasting of this movie or the characters in it. Just walk a mile or two in the shoes of these men or men like them and then tell me what you think.This may not have been a very objective commentary, but being an emotional guy, I just had to speak from my heart. Thanks.",Brokeback Mountain
2125,steve-2545,It hurts so GOOD,10,30 January 2006,"I've seen this movie twice and will see it at least one more time in the theater. I will never be the same man again. I also bought the wonderful soundtrack and have played it dozens of times, usually with lots of tears. I've been ""Shot to the heart"".Why this reaction from someone who rarely cries? Because during the late 70s, I lived my life in college as a gay man, looking for love ""in all the wrong places"" and never finding it. I've since married and have a wonderful son, but I still have the feelings and attractions. I haven't been with a man since college, but sometimes long for it (my wife knows this). I've come to the conclusion that the chances of leaving my wife and looking for a lover and being as happy as I am now are about the same as a supernova occurring tomorrow. I believe it does happen, but is a very rare thing, partly because of the deep passion and power men can have together - it's easy to burnout.Jack and Ennis had a GREAT LOVE. Maybe they never said it to each other, but they surely knew it. Their love is right up there with Romeo and Juliet, and the characters in countless other romantic tragedies. There were so many good reasons why they could never have ""a little cow and calf operation"". They loved each other and they loved Brokeback Mountain. The three of them were totally woven together.I feel like Jack was my lover and I lost him. I wish I could hold Ennis, like he would probably never be held again in his life. There would never be another person like Jack.If people say this is all about how homophobic and repressed our culture was and is, they're missing the whole point. Yes it was and still is. But, strictly from a literary standpoint, all of the restrictions were needed in order to make for a great tragedy. The time, the place, the culture, everything fits perfectly together.Today, Jack and Ennis could join the Gay Cattleman's Association and probably get a loan to setup their little ranch. The fact that they could be with each other so little added to the richness and power of their time together and their longing for the next time. Their lives revolved around those liaisons. Who can say that if they had settled down, their explosive relationship would have endured? But, just as it is, it's one of the saddest, most powerful movies I've ever seen. Only time will tell how deeply I'm affected by it. But right now it hurts me, but it's also bringing healing to my soul.",Brokeback Mountain
2126,hollar2008,Deserves an Oscar...,10,30 January 2006,"This movie has moved and touched me beyond words. I cannot begin to explain how I felt after seeing it. Annie Proulx is a fantastic novelist, and with the direction of Ang Lee this movie came to life! The casts portrayal of the characters was excellent, and very believable. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal both deserve Oscars for their bravery in taking on a role of such a complicated subject, and plowing through it. They truly made this film enjoyable with their acting, and I am so thrilled they did take on this role. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway also did an excellent job as supporting actresses. Without them, this story would not have been as great as it was. Bravo to all of the main casts! I have not doubt this movie WILL win the Oscar for best motion picture-drama-of the year. If it does not, there is something seriously wrong!!!! This movie is BY FAR THE BEST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!!!! BRAVO TO ANG LEE AND THE CAST INVOLVED!",Brokeback Mountain
2127,captaincroc,"Remarkable, Haunting, Groundbreaking, Heartwarming, Heart Wrenching........do i need to go on?",10,6 February 2006,"Well i first saw the film over 2 weeks ago (and seen it a few times since then) and i have to say that i have NEVER been touched by a movie like this EVER, especially not to write in a review of it so that shows the depth.Now I'm not going to go into too much detail of the whole general film as there are lots of fantastic detailed reviews already. I've just come on here to put my 2 pence worth about some of the topics its brought up and to reply to some of the reviews.The movie i heard about a few months back and listening from the media about it being ""2 Gay cowboys"" didn't really interest me as i thought it would be overly done(Hollywood style), e.g obvious CAMP gays with limp wrists, being bitchy etc, but after hearing the reviews i thought i would give it a watch. HOW WRONG WAS I? There are so many things great about it that i cant begin to explain but most have been said in previous reviews. I love the way its so subtle and slow moving and not filled with action scenes to one liners that most Hollywood ""blockbusters"" seem to have to have.As a gay man myself it is EXTREMELY frustrating that the media in all forms tend to play Gay men, as camp, hairdressers, bitchy, all ""look at me"" etc. Thats why Brokeback mountain deserves more praise as it shows them as macho normal males, which is what most gay men are (like myself), its just you don't ""see"" them as such because they mingle more with the background of society. It shows them in love but trying to cover it up (more so with ennis) for the sake of the society at the time. Like has been said a million times before but the acting is faultless and just with the looks they give each other you really feel they are real and in love.Now to reply to a few reviews and points already on here, 1st regarding the film being ""slow"" and ""boring"", I feel that unfortunately people have got use to Hollywood making films so In your face, with big action scenes and special effects, films that need to be fillered with one liners just to fill a poor storyline. That when a film comes out that challenges all that, with little storyline, relying more on the scenery and more importantly the Acting that some people unfortunately lose interest, which is such a shame as i loved the pace of the film. The slow pace in which we learn about the characters makes you feel like your there and you know them, especially when you feel like your grieving at the end.Secondly people saying, ""well it would get a different reaction if it wasn't man loving man"", well films are not supposed to be broad. They have to to be specific within it's characters and environment for it to achieve its main goal... Thats like telling the fans of Titanic "" I bet if the Ship didn't sink you probably wouldn't have loved it like you do""... Do you see the dilemma with it.... In Brokeback, The two characters have to be two men for the story to work.Quite a few of my friends have seen it, most on my recommendation and the majority LOVED it, the few that didn't, and i mean a few, were surprising girls, they said it was boring and switched off half way through, but they admitted that they love action thriller which this definitely isn't.I know this hasn't exactly been a review about the film in full, as like i said there is hundreds of fantastic reviews (apart from the pathetic hyprocritcal homophobes), which could detail the film better than me.I just thought after reading a lot of reviews i had a few points to make If you really are a avid movie goer, with an open mind you will LOVE this film, why do you think the major movie reviewers for the media love this film.I've never been touched and moved by a movie so much as this one, and as many people say i kept and keep thinking about it as if their real people. God i need to get out more.And just to finish there are so many touching scenes where the music really does tug on your heart strings but i have my take on the ""I swear"" line I've been thinking and i have come up with this conclusion. Its just after the heart wrenching sense with his daughter and if her fiancé loved her, she leaves, He buttons up the shirt and then straightens up the Postcard of Brokeback mountain, and then says it.After talking about love, his shirt etc he is swearing that if he could go back and change (set up ranch with him etc) then he would. As its obvious Jacks parents know he is gay. Anyone else's opinion would be gratefully received The only thing i would say is please don't go into the cinema hyping this film up and i don't want you to be disappointed, but go in with an open mind and I'm sure you would love it",Brokeback Mountain
2128,ladybugfla60,Movie left me awakened,10,31 January 2006,"I have to say from the start that I went to see this movie out of curiosity, then came out of it with my heart opened wide and aching for the characters in the movie. This is the best movie I have ever seen. I am a straight women in my sixties and you are never too old to have your senses awakened. Great performances. I was never so touched as when Heath is looking at the post card and the shirt/jacket in the last scene of the movie. Showed the depth of his love for Jack. I attended the movie with four other women, I feel we were all touched in one way or another. Every scene with Jack and Ennis in each other's arms was done with good taste. If you attend in order to see racy gay love making you will be disappointed. This movie stresses the romantic love between two males. Also shows the intense hatred for gays back in the sixties. I hope and pray that we all can learn something from this. How can we condemn someone for loving? Why would we hate someone for loving?",Brokeback Mountain
2129,nathanandary,Very Disappointing,1,31 January 2006,"I felt that this movie is bastardization and commercialization of a very intimate experience that requires great attention to the detail and the process leading up to the actions / decisions brought to life through the characters. I would assume, based upon what I saw, that the director has not had this experience and approached the topic from an ""outsider"" perspective. I feel that the director, and the lead actors, did not achieve the true essence of the inner workings of the storyline within each of the characters.I feel that the director spent more time on showing the decisions that each male character made regarding the sharing of the sexuality / passion / trust / love / etc. than the process leading up to those decisions. You cannot have the bread without the peanut butter and jelly to make a sandwich. Otherwise you have bread. The problem with this movie is that both men did not spend enough time developing the center of their characters and having that energy radiate outward to the representations of men going through the process of love and reconciling whatever religion, environmental, masculine, machismo standards that have been imposed upon them since their birth. I would agree that Heath Ledger was wonderful in showing his age and progression through the movie.I have to give kudos to the make up artist and the way in which Heath was shot as the movie progressed. However, I was disappointed in the amount of Wyoming scene shots that were used in the beginning of the movie and that the interactions between the two did not have an escalation leading up to the consummation of passion and deep-seated feelings brought to the surface by the other character. Additionally, I did not care for the amount of ""sappy"" music throughout the entire movie and felt like the movie on the whole was a series of still shots linked together and did not have the fluidity in the development of the idea and the execution of the idea to quench my taste. It all made me think that an ""outsider"" was attempting to capture an intimate experience that is full of real and raw emotion and substance that would give great material for an actor to really hone some methods and skills.Unfortunately, the details were not attended and the attempt, in my opinion, failed. It is a clear representation that the director tried to replicate a story that was not familiar to him and you can see / sense / feel that throughout the film. On the flip side, I appreciate that the subject matter is put out into the mainstream for others to witness and view. I realize that I have placed a hyper critical eye / perspective on the film and its presentation of the subject matter. However, I do find value in the larger scope of what we are presented everyday.",Brokeback Mountain
2130,jtn960,The Last Third makes the Movie.,8,3 February 2006,"I have argued with the group of guys I went to see this with about the first 2/3, which I found boring. To me, it wasn't even much of a story. But the last third, no doubt, makes the movie. Throughout, though, there were several scenes that I said to myself or the person next to me, ""yeah, that's happened to me."" The story line very much reminded me of the Michener novel ""Centennial."" Although Brokeback is set in the 20th century, there were several related themes. This thought first hit me when seeing all the sheep. I laughed thinking about it - I've come to see a movie about herding sheep. Both stories are set in two states with Texas in both. Colorado is the other state in Cenetennial.The scenery in Brokeback is breathtaking. I understand it was filmed in western Canada. My friends have been back to see it. I have not because, as I said, there were too many things I identified with personally. But I highly recommend it.Also, Jack Twist is a hottie.",Brokeback Mountain

It's just such a beautiful movie that gives you a whole new perspective on love and relationships. Even though the relationship is between 2 men, their passion is the same as any 2 people in love. Jake and Heath did such an awesome job and are perfectly cast for this movie. I think the movie touches people because deep inside we all want to find love like that- passionate and lasting.

2133,PimmyG,Thank gosh for Duh-Byah!,9,1 February 2006,"I am very glad that George Bush, a right-wing Republican who has spoken out openly against gay rights, actually has sent our troops to Iraq to fight for gay rights. Since he is fighting for freedom and liberty, as he keeps saying, this must by definition include gay rights, and after the US, gays are Enemy #1 of Muslims (in Iran they hang them). It is very ironic indeed that Christians and Muslims have one thing in common: hatred of gays. What's funny is that Duh-Byah is touting personal liberties and freedoms, apparently not meaning to include gays in the list of people who get to have these liberties. But by fighting ""tyranny"" in Iraq, and fighting for freedom, inclusion of gay rights and liberties--if not by definition than by the sheer number of gays in the US--has to be included in the mix. He might speak out against gays, but he practices protecting and promoting their freedoms. I wonder what all the fundamentalist Christians would think if they actually pondered this conundrum. Actions DO speak louder than words. Thanks to all the troops and to King George! I loved this movie!!",Brokeback Mountain

It's not just about gay cowboy. It's just simply LOVE story and that's what made it one of my most favourite movie ever made. Ang lee captured of both the story line is so classic and simple. The hot scene surprising has been done only once and both actors really delivered what the movie needs. The rest of supporting actress also did very good performance.

2135,cander51,"""Is it better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all?""",10,31 January 2006,"I would consider this one of the saddest, if not the saddest movie, I have ever seen. Some might say this is an exaggeration, that I'm merely overwhelmed having seen the movie a few days ago. But the difference between ""Brokeback Mountain"" and other movies is that in the end, there's no victory. No triumph really. It simply say ""love should be enough. It should conquer all,"" yet it leaves with the question ""is love enough? Does it conquer all?"" It's thrown me for a loop. The character of Ennis Del Mar is one of the most complex characters I've ever seen. I didn't know what he wanted or who he really was. He was impossible to read, and Ledger made it impossible to form a finite opinion about him. It's not until the last seen, when he's remembering Jack and states the simple line ""Jack, I swear..."" that it's really brought to light how much he loved him, and what he really wanted. It's almost painful to watch. How could someone not let themselves have love? Jack Twist was so different from Ennis, it really added to the movie. It could have been so easy for their characters to blend into the same person. But the differences were so visible and caused me to feel so different about the characters. The end of this movie really asked the question ""is it better to have loved and lost, than never to have loved at all?"" I personally can't answer. I'm not sure anymore. Any movie that can undermine my original opinions is a winner in my book.""Brokeback Mountain"" is an instant classic: a movie to be cherished for years to come.",Brokeback Mountain

The movie takes you on an amazing journey and your emotions feel like they're on a roller-coaster. This story has moved me, which for Ang Lee, must be the reason he does what he does.

The cinematic beauty of the landscape is STUNNING, the musical score is HAUNTING and the performances of all the actors will draw you into the screen, into their lives, their pain and ultimately into their love for each other. How precious is such love, we all crave it, we want it, for that is what life is to be, shared with someone you love, your soul mate and Jack and Ennis were just that true soul mates until the end...""I swear"". It amazes me that in this time we live,more than 20 years after this movie take place we still can condemn such a love between 2 people, yet we praise it when it is of the same sex. I wonder how far we really have come? This movie is not about sex at all and when watching this you realize that very quickly. I read the short story twice and it made me love the movie even more.Annie Prolx is a master and Ang Lee has given us a visual masterpiece to match her words. I find myself in the middle of the day my eyes tearing up when I tell someone how wonderful this film is, how it has captured me and won't let me go.

2140,camille531,Unrealistic scene ruined realism for me,5,1 February 2006,"The first time the characters played by Heath and Jake had sex, they seemed to know exactly what to do. They tugged on their belts and had sex. If they were new to gay sex, shouldn't there have been some awkwardness as to who should do what, what body part should be where?This actually ruined the whole movie for me in terms of believability. Unless they had read a lot about gay sex or they seen a lot of movies on the subject, it seems that they should have been confused. In fact, even if Jake had had such previous experience and was a sexual predator, it should still have been awkward for Heath. I just didn't believe that scene - or much of what followed.",Brokeback Mountain

But Oh Dear Me, what was all the fuss about. I kept waiting for the ""real movie"" to start. I saw the beautiful scenery, I saw both of the good looking male leads. I grasped the storyline before I even went in to the cinema. But the movie just didn't start for me. Maybe thirty or forty years ago the story would have been shocking, I could have watched in then and marvelled at the bold story line. However in 2006 it just seemed lame, the film seemed to rely too much on shots of massed sheep and the rolling hills. I wanted to see the relationship between the two men develop more fully, I wanted to see the tender moments, the secret looks. I wanted to see two people in love, but unfortunately it just seemed so disjointed and I left the cinema feeling somehow cheated.

2142,rv94,Just in time!,10,1 February 2006,"I saw this movie just in time to avoid the same kind of pain that Jack Twist experienced by falling in love with an unavailable man. In fact, I saw the movie only 1 day before I was to fly to Texas to live with a bi married guy who was being divorced by his wife. We had met a year earlier in truck driving school and had become fast friends. He called me and told me that he was being divorced and thus began a 2-month conversation. We talked for hours almost every day on the phone for months and become emotionally attached (or at least I had). Some of our conversations were very sexual and he acted as though I could be his lover. We had decided that I would move in as his ""roommate."" This was a red flag for me and he had told no one about me coming. Another red flag. He was very closeted with his family and friends. My gut instinct kept telling me that this was not right but I ignored it until I saw this movie. The night before I was to fly to Texas, I called him to confirm that he was going to pick me up at the airport and he was like a different person. He told me (just like in the movie) that his life was centered around his two little girls and he was going to start them in church. The implication was that there would be no room for a relationship with me. He would not pick me up at the airport and was cold and distant. He was abandoning me just when I needed him and really flaked out. Just like Ennis Del Mar. Well, after seeing how Jack Twist wasted all those years waiting around for a relationship with Ennis, I learned from his mistake and dropped this man like a hot potato and am glad I did, even though it was painful.Brokeback Mountain showed me that I have to be careful who I fall in love with. Jack kept holding on to the idea that someday they would be a couple. But, Ennis told him from the start that it would never happen. He should have believed him and not wasted all those years waiting around for Ennis. I never want to fall in love with a guy who is not emotionally and publicly available. People like Ennis are really pathetic.",Brokeback Mountain

And when I found out that this type of film was being played in Theaters I was even more amazed. But I wasn't amazed at the fact that it was bad that they were showing this film in theaters BUT Extremely HAPPY! Happy that finally! That society lets us put a Homosexual film in Theaters but you don't even look at it as a Gay movie its another great Romantic love story like any other and the message that it gives people that people like us, Gay people are not just going out to party and have sex were just like any other person, the same emotions to fall in LOVE. And That is why I LOVE this Movie, its message and for that I Thank You Annie, Ang Lee, Heath, Jake and all the other people that helped make and write this movie, You just dint make a movie you made a message.""

Soul love is a complimentary emotion which fills the other half of a whole. It completes each beat, it sustains life with each breath, it is Soul Love.I wrote the above before I saw the movie, but it shares the same theme with the movie's message.Brokeback Mountain encompasses all the above and more. It is a true love story that is timeless. Secretly I think we all wish to find that deep of love. Thank you for making a profoundly moving love story that touched the very core of what love is. The pentacle of romance. Although societies shallow mindedness prevails, this movie will touch the deepest recesses of your soul. It is a reminder that Love knows no boundaries or gender.

(i am a graduate of a film school so this is hard for me to acknowledge it now). go see it. go see it and only THEN decide what you think. don't let the gay propaganda or chhristian propaganda decide for you. see it with your own yes:) peace no offence to anyone ..but i typed cchristian with chhristian since that is the only way i can keep it all uncapitalized. - amazing that, that would be THE only word i must capitalize !!!",Brokeback Mountain
2146,chitha_14,"brilliant, heart breaking, a film for life.",10,6 February 2006,"I was not sure what the storey line was when I went to see the film, except that it is a love storey between two cowboys. The film was a bit slow moving but touching and capturing the hearts and minds of the audience until the climax. It was a heart breaking, numbing experience when the climax came and the desperation you feel for Enin and Jack is enormous. I felt like I was living with them in Wyoming and being part of their lives. I know why the pain in their hearts touched me and many others in a way no other film touched us before because it can be a storey of our lives too. The loss of love we suffered at some point in our life, the unexpressed feelings of ours for our loved ones, which we could never say now as it's too late...etc..etc. I am sure we all would have lost opportunities to express love at some point in life and these feeling come back to haunt us. I will never forget Ennis or Jack in my life or Brokeback mountain. It's a beautiful place full of happy memories of those two poor souls. It's a film for life and I am glad that I had the opportunity to see it.It still hurts after seeing it 10 days ago and occupies my heart and mind in every single minute I have alone.I lay thinking about the film every single night before I doze-off. I am going to see the film again as i want to feel the pain again and shed some tears for Enin and Jack. I couldn't control my tears when Enin cuddles Jack's clothes and cry in pain. I wish I was there to comfort him because it seems so real. Hats-off to Heath and Jake. Well done guys and I hope to see the sequel of this film one day soon, will there be one?27/02/06 I went to see the film again and I am now totally obsessed with it. I want to see it again and again and no other film in my life ever made me feel like this. I cried my eyes out and saw too many others doing the same. What a film? one for a life time. If you have not seen it yet, then go and see it, put your prejudices on the side and see the film. Then you will realise that ""LOVE IS A FORCE OF NATURE"".",Brokeback Mountain
2147,jakob-bruntse,Best movie about impossible love for years,10,2 February 2006,I don't think anyone can watch Brokeback Mountain without being deeply moved. It is a story about impossible love between Romeo and Romeo  Jake and Ennis  and it is so heartbreaking because it is just a story about two men falling in love. Though this is also why the film is controversial. And that might just be one of the reasons why it feels so relevant and true. Even today millions of people all over the world do actually get persecuted because they are gay. Just as people are denied their freedom because of their color or religion. That is a very important story to tell but what makes Ang Lee's version of the tale such a convincing and beautiful piece of fiction is that it does not get sentimental or explicitly moralizing.,Brokeback Mountain

We (both) incredulous hearing a horrible dialogs (it is well known that we do have the best translators in the world)the blond cow boy especially!The least emotional movie I ever remember. I should say regarding the motions of the actors and their ""love"" expressions: it was like being in a plastic world. No point if the story is about gay or else love. Just fake. It reminded us the dialogues of telenovelas from Argentina or Brasil of the 80s. So obvious that I could guess what they were going to say. By the way, why the wife waited a half an hour to divorce from the blond one? Was it an editing mistake? When we went out,it was like liberation from big cosmic bore. My friend is a Ang Lee fun but I think even directors get old, some becomes genius some others no. Just to remind a unique ""gay love"" movie: Philadelphia. Do you agree?",Brokeback Mountain

I can't recall a time when I felt so moved and emotional after watching this classic love story. I could not stop crying at the end of the film. My heart is still aching and feeling so sad. The film is brilliant! The scenery is breathtakingly beautiful! Having travelled across Canada by car several times, I've seen the Rockies; I've been in Alberta numerous times but never have I seen this area of Canada illustrated in a film so incredibly stunning. The film is a masterpiece! Heath Ledger's performance was superb! At the end of the movie Willie Nelson performed especially for the film singing 'He Was a Friend Of Mine', (originally by Bob Dylan). The song is both poignant and lyrical, it could almost have been written with the film in mind. Go see this movie......and take lots of Kleenex!

At the end, I was duly and deservingly rewarded.I was rewarded with pain and regrets, pain and regrets of love lost, and for the loneliness of not able to be honest with one's own feeling, and the fear of the consequences of being unique or non-conformance, and the suffering of helplessly seeing others being hurt along the way.This story may have reflex on our own lives and the lives of others around us. It may have created ripples in the society. It may even have resonant with our pass experiences.But at the end, after the heart ripping finale and some tears, I have come to realize that it may have just been a great story, of two men, excellently told in a movie.

The film, on its own merit, is strikingly ordinary. It is not particularly well acted. It is not particularly well directed. What we have here with sophomoric lines is a teenage romance story placed in a foreign setting. Admittingly, some of the mountain scenes are appealing. Some of the issues raised are interesting. The acting, though, is subpar. Quaid and the girl from Dawson's Creek are the only two good performances in the entire movie. It deserves from true critics of movies (and not the social critics that seem to proliferate in this movie's reviews) big thumbs down. Save your money or go see Munich.",Brokeback Mountain
2153,stardog70,My heart is full up,10,5 February 2006,"Old Brokeback Mountain has sure grabbed hold of my heart and seems in no hurry to let go. I'm not one who habitually sees movies multiple times, but this one I just can't shake off. In all my long life I've never experienced anything like this: seen it at least five times, re-read the Proulx story again and again, finally was able to buy the soundtrack just today (2/14). Powerful, classic, spare, spacious, filled with silences, a metaphor for all life's disappointments and tragedies and great loves lost, and just about as perfect a film as I've ever seen. The director lets each viewer connect the dots for him/herself, contemplating the ambiguities (like the flashback scene) and involving them in the film in a way no obvious telling could do. Each time I see it, it reveals more exquisite little details. It took four viewings before I noticed Ennis, in the very last scene, folding his daughter's sweater against his chest, holding it to his face and carefully placing it on the shelf in his closet. What a telling gesture, revealing the deeply loving heart of his character without a word. And then the shirts.Kudos to Ang Lee, and to every one of the fine actors and writers who brought this masterpiece to life. It deserves every award, and seems to me to be a film that can heal wounds and bridge gulfs between people, if it is allowed to. The tears we shed viewing it may be our own griefs and fears leaking out.",Brokeback Mountain
2154,LostEden2,Living with Choices,10,4 February 2006,"Forget the media distortions. This isn't a movie about ""gay cowboys.""First of all they weren't cowboys. They were two 19 year-olds who took jobs as a sheep herder and camp tender. Later in life one worked at an implement dealership and the other worked for a rancher but lived at home.Secondly, they weren't gay. Society says that a man can be attracted to and make love to a thousand women, but do the same with one other male and he's gay? Come on. By that definition, if you throw in childhood and adolescent experimentation, 90% of the male population is gay. Men can be able to love several women during their lifetime, but if they're also able to love one man they're gay? Who makes up these rules? Instead, this is a movie about the choices we make and living with those choices. It's about having or not having regret. And, it's a movie about love so strong it endures a lifetime. For me, it was also about society's demanding obedience to a strict code that wants to pound square pegs into round holes, to define what our behavior and feelings are allowed to be. Why the human fascination with who's doing what with who? Why the human need to process, categorize, label, and cram each of us into pigeon holes? Straight ... gay ... bi. Better live up to one of these labels or there'll be hell to pay from all sides.The writing, direction, and performances in this film are perfection. This isn't like watching actors in a movie, it's like seeing the lives of real people unfold. It will haunt you because its themes are both personal and universal. This is one of the most powerful films you'll ever see.I guess the media needed to label this movie.

I went into this movie with reservations, and as I took my seat, I felt that maybe I would regret spending my paltry 7.00 on this movie. As it began, and minutes ticked away, I soon realized it was worth every cent. Long after this movie ended, you find yourself returning to it with more and more thoughts and questions as to the life of the characters. But more than that, it made me reflect on issues in which I had never really given much thought to. Maybe this movie will make people see more than what is just in their small little world and be more tolerate of others and their lifestyles.

2157,a_hunter80,"""Astounding and...Astounded!""",10,4 February 2006,"First and foremost, let me get my opinion of 'Brokeback Mountain' out of the way before I write what is really on my mind. I am a 25 year old, heterosexual woman and have not been as deeply moved, touched and wow'd by a film as much as this one. My boyfriend feels the same, as do many of our friends. I was raised spiritually and ethically with a strong belief in Jesus Christ, and, respect for the religious beliefs and constructive opinions of others. I stress the terms ""respect"" and ""constructive opinions"". For the most part, although I do appreciate that IMDb/Yahoo affords individuals the right to express their views on films, I am absolutely disgusted and appalled by the endless spewing of personal prejudice and evil ridicule ""some"" reviewers on this site, and others, have perpetrated. This small group of people (if you notice, most of the individuals grading this film an ""F"" or ""0"" have the exact same writing style, typical bad grammar and as much understanding of 'Brokeback Mountain' as they've seen in television commercials or heard through the media) have taken it upon themselves, not to review a ""film"", but, to express their ignorant, uneducated opinions and absolute hatred of a singular group of people to the masses. It's interesting that we tend to hate and be repulsed by the one thing we fear most in ourselves. Food for thought. The films impact speaks for itself. 'Brokeback Mountain' has already averaged nearly 90 million dollars world-wide, has continually placed in the top 10 for the past 7 weeks, has been viewed by the President of the United States (who actually sat through and watched it in its entirety) has won over 48 different awards and is nominated for 8 Academy Awards. That, I would surmise, is 'review' enough. And that 'review' is from the majority of North American film goers. Am I a 'Brokeback' fan? Definitely. The movie is thought provoking, awe inspiring and breathtaking in its simplicity. I would strongly urge anyone who has the slightest interest in seeing this film to do so, if not only for the curiosity, but, for the amazing experience this film is, if you allow it to be. It does help, mind you, that you have an education. There is some serious metaphoric symbolism throughout the film. That probably explains why all the ""F"" and ""0"" individuals here on IMDb/Yahoo just didn't get it. Not the film. The education. See you at the Oscars Brokeback.",Brokeback Mountain

Heath Ledgers performance was unparalleled, but Jake Gyllanhaals performance went beyond any expectations that I could ever have entertained. The fact that most of the Kudos for this movie have been laid at Heath and Ang Lees feet does bother me. Jake has shown us all, in this performance that he is definitely no bubble boy and as such should have received much more recognition. I have not been able to stop thinking about this movie since I left the theater. When people ask me ""isn't that the movie about the gay cowboys""? I resoundingly answer NO! it is not.

2159,rfallon1,"A let down, but beautifully shot",6,4 February 2006,"I really expected more from this picture with all of the awards, nominations, and the hype. I guess that is why we all form our own opinion and this is mine.I found big problems in the way the characters developed. It really took a very long time for any conflict to arise. The first piece of passion came out of left field and was really jarring. I found it to be not believable.From there on I had a hard time with the characters motivations and there decision making, but a more difficult time with the supporting cast which seemed to really be an after thought. Their motivations seemed disjointed and again non-credible. Michelle Williams' character was presented at the wedding and two scenes later without aging she had two children. I know as an audience we are supposed to accept changes in time, but the filmmaker's job is to make that believable and bridge the scenes.Every time a new scene was presented years had passed without any real indication. The love story here wasn't enough to hide the flaws of the storytelling and the film structure. We spent tons of time on the mountain trying to develop a hard to understand relationship (I have more passionate conversations with people at the mall in line for pretzels) and we're supposed to ride out the internal conflicts and poorly told supporting cast conflicts until 25 years later (with no good visual signs of aging) the character gets killed in a gay bashing hate crime.The story is all over the place, and many of the 'other' relationships just don't really make any sense; Heath and his freshly divorced(2 scenes later) wife share thanksgiving with the kids and her new husband - again hard to believe. Another example, Jake's character and his father-in-law, tons of anger with underdeveloped subtext, that isn't backed by anything in the rest of the story. Jake's wife is someone he meets in bar, hooks up with and in the next scene has a 4 week old child.The story is long, but long without really developing anything but internal struggles with open homosexuality and social norms. If we have to watch something this long, give us more well rounded character development.My guess is the story was much better told before some studio focus groups got hold of it, and then many meaningful parts got cut out. I expected more from the film and I was very disappointed.On a positive note, Rodrigo Prieto beautifully captured the semblance of a film that we got, and is very well deserving of the Best Cinematography nomination",Brokeback Mountain

I saw it a little over a week ago, but it left a lingering feeling of heartache. This movie is constantly on my mind, and after seeing it I fully intend to read the short story by Anne Proulx.

Brokeback mountain captured the essence of the love epic drama, it crosses all boundaries. You feel like this movie is not just a gay flick but it contains the elements of what Love drama with a twist is. The actors are phenomenal/amazing and really captivating in their roles. I felt every tear drop and every word that was uttered in the movie. The scene that best showed all the movie was trying to impart was the time that Ennis had known of the event that transpired regarding what happened to Jack. The most tear jerking scene for me was when he was reminiscing of his lost love, when he hugged Jacks' jacket in the closet. That was a Big moment for me.. I cried and cried that people in the cinema were already looking at me and really giving me a mean stare like their saying shut up you big hag..More or less.. I watched it with my boyfriend and he couldn't contain me even make me stop sobbing..Well that's how I watch, take me or hate me..

For days I felt like I did when I was unexpectedly fired or had some rug pulled out from under me. I did not really believe a film could get me to phone friends asking if my interpretation of a scene or dialogue was correct. This isn't celluloid, but flesh and blood. The final image with the camera panning from the picture postcard of the beautiful scenic Brokeback mountain to the dreary, flat reality of the landscape viewed from the trailer window was a perfect metaphor ($10 word), for Ennis present and probably future reality. I may view the film again, but not soon. Too painful. I hope this film receives the Best Picture Oscar for 2005. Because it was. And that win is not perceived as some 'Hollywood, liberal, thumbing-their-noses at red-states' gesture. P.S. In reading others critiques many seem to make opinions based on misreading the film. Rape? What rape? Jack undressed FIRST and rolled over. (Guess he already KNEW he was a bottom).Jack was already gay! Lest we forget he later 'came on' to a rodeo clown in a bar. Ennis was confused, he never had any feelings like this for another man. Jack's homosexuality required sex with men,(the hustler) Ennis just wanted Jack, the sex was part of the package.",Brokeback Mountain
2163,bjreviewer,"Political views surrounding this ""Seventh Art""",8,7 February 2006,"I am not a native English speaker. So sorry for my bad English. I am trying to see this as a person looking from outside of the American culture.Writing a review about this movie is very difficult. And the difficulty seems to be only based on the controversy about the story of the movie. So I am sorry if I am going to write about this controversy more in this review. I felt that many of the reviews written are biased because of it.In one way I think this movie is making history: It is just amazing how politicians and activist now a day take advantage of it, even its movie review pages. Now that this movie is popular everyone wants to gain from it. Some consciously and some unconsciously. In most of the countries movie is considered as an art along with its entertaining values. It has been referred to as ""the seventh art"". This movie is also a work of art. Though its entertaining value is not as prominent as its artistry.The right wing says that Hollywood is evil and homosexual and the left wing says that the right is homophobe. And in a way I think both are recruiting people towards their wing by LABELING!! The protagonists in this movie are only human. Not gay not evil. They are two lonely men.Everyone now a day is playing the smart guy, as if there was a revelation and they found out about themselves. They refer to homosexuality even as ""coming out"" as if it is a kind of divine revelation!!! They say I am gay!! Some say I am Christian!! And it is amazing that people actually identify themselves with these stigmas. Believe me in many cultures people are not categorized as homo, hetero or bi sexual. The act might be categorized. But the person is not. Even in many religions which are considered fundamentalist now a day you are referred only to as a ""believer"" and no other name. ""The words ""homosexual"" and ""heterosexual"", according to the Oxford English Dictionary, did not even exist in the English language before 1900, but now hang heavily and oppressively over all of the American culture.""With all the discussions about Islamic fundamentalism you sometimes wonder if fundamentalism is emerging in everything. Do we now have ""Gay fundamentalism"" along with ""Christian fundamentalism""? Brokeback Mountain is an art and art does not have any boundaries. And does not conform to political views. This movie is a form of art with whatever message that gives us. For an art to be appreciated one also must have the ability for appreciation and certain amount of knowledge. Like for me it was really hard to appreciate English poetry. Because my knowledge of English language was not enough. Though the meanings are universal to everyone who is called a human being. But I see that a group is steeling the movie for promoting their agenda and another group is condemning it again to promote their agenda. This is a betrayal of the art.Annie Proulx, Ange Lee, the actors the musician and every one are artists depicting something. This should be appreciated for the arts sake regardless of the message. In ""Natural born killer"" the artist was depicting homicide. Obviously this is not for children who can not appreciate it or for the uneducated. This is why I think many consider this movie boring and slow or pointless. Artists in Brokeback mountain show humanly traits like loneliness, longing intimacy, struggle with life, choices and the tragic happenings due to them their life. I am going to quote from Annie Proulx original story to show how artfully she depicts it: ...""What Jack remembered and craved in a way he could neither help nor understand was the time that distant summer on Brokeback when Ennis had come up behind him and pulled him close, the silent embrace satisfying some shared and sexless hunger. They had stood that way for a long time in front of the fire, its burning tossing ruddy chunks of light, the shadow of their bodies a single column against the rock. The minutes ticked by from the round watch in Ennis's pocket, from the sticks in the fire settling into coals. Stars bit through the wavy heat layers above the fire. Ennis's breath came slow and quiet, he hummed, rocked a little in the sparklight and Jack leaned against the steady heartbeat, the vibrations of the humming like faint electricity and, standing, he fell into sleep that was not sleep but something else drowsy and tranced until Ennis, dredging up a rusty but still useable phrase from the childhood time before his mother died, said, ""Time to hit the hay, cowboy. I got a go. Come on, you're sleepin on your feet like a horse,"" and gave Jack a shake, a push, and went off in the darkness. Jack heard his spurs tremble as he mounted, the words ""see you tomorrow,"" and the horse's shuddering snort, grind of hoof on stone.""This is neither gay nor evil. She artfully depicts the peace Jake has when he is with Ennis through sexless human intimacy. And Ange Lee and the actors act out this scene beautifully.After the golden age of American cinema was finished Hollywood no longer made movies about people. With this movie I think the trend is going to change back.",Brokeback Mountain

Maybe repression? Surely.:)The important and I think this is a truth of the movie, is that IT Doesn't MATTER Whether THEY WERE IN LOVE OR NOT. Movies, like music, are 101% subjective. Sometimes we cant figure out what is going on within ourselves, so try to figure out whats inside another person, in a movie , in 2 hours ... a little difficult don't you think?THE IMPORTANT of the movie is what they do, what they decide, and how with that decisions, our life goes one way or another.TRUTH OF THE MOVIE 2. IT Doesn't MATTER THEY WERE IN 1963 YEAR 2003 - I had the same story a few years ago, (but with 2 girls, I'm straight) (not having children luckily, and not being married) with a girl being dating another girl. YEAR 2003. My fears, your fears, if you had a similar story, ARE THE SAME AS THE ONE OF THE CHARACTERS. OK, I wouldn't be killed if i was discovered, i accept that (..anyway would they?) but... all the other fears are UNIVERSAL and happen in 2006. What fears? Fear of how will it be with her and lose my other girl which was a constructed 3 years love, some fears related to her parents acceptance, friends, losing everything..etc. etc. Fear of losing everything, losing yourself.... don't you get connected with this, or to what the characters experienced? :)Was it only passion, was it love? WE WILL NEVER KNOW. Yes, I agree, like someone said, we will need a few more years of movie and a relationship to see what happens. And that either , if they broke up suppose, doesn't mean they didn't love each other. I agree! They seemed to love each other. I agree! They seemed to have sex in the mountain and get drunk only! IT Doesn't MATTER WHICH IS THE TRUTH.THE TRUTH AND CRUCIAL MESSAGE OF THE MOVIE is ""WHAT WOULD HAVE IT BEEN IF ...?"" (someone already posted this) .The film may have touched you for any other lots of things, but in the end, its a story of ordinary people, like everyone of us. LIFE IS WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU while you are not watching TV. What you have to do , do it now. TOMORROW, it can be late.LOVE , yes , its like the CASINO, if you didn't put the chip on time on the roulette for the number you were thinking, YOU IN THE MOST CASES: LOSE. You might have more chances in the future, but one day, when you didn't expected one of the two take a decision, (or one dies like in the movie) and thats all folks. If you didn't put the chip on time, the other question the movie lets flow is :WILL YOU TORTURE YOURSELF FOREVER? Or will YOU GIVE A CHANCE FOR LOVE for a new person? Will you live like ENNIS keeping a jacket with blood and looking to a poster? OR WILL YOU CARRY ON... ?Hope you liked my point of view, feel free to reply to me with your comments. Greetings!",Brokeback Mountain

It's because Ennis and Jack love each other and  can find no way to deal with that.The cold society made this love can  not go further.  After seen this film,I hope more and more people can understand this  kind of love and there will be much more lovers as Jack and Ennis can  have a happy life in our society.  This is one of the best movie I have ever seen.I hope Michelle  Williams,Heath Ledger , Jake Gyllenhaal,Ang Lee could get the prize in  Oscar.But after Brokeback Mountain,they have already get much things,at  least,they make people knows what is their own broke back mountains in  his or her deep heart.",Brokeback Mountain
2166,john_a_jones,Big Bang of Movies,10,6 February 2006,"It has now been a week since I saw the ""emotional dirty bomb"" Brokeback Mountain. Just like a dirty bomb the initial shockwave knocked me out, but clearly the devastation is the follow-up punch. I did not sleep well that night. Scenes just kept popping in my head, words said, etc. Then all of a sudden Matthew Sheppard pops into my head. Geez! I'm a wreck, soon as I get up - it's on the Internet to see anything I can find on the movie.I don't try to keep up with the Hollywood crowd. As an example: several months ago I visited my neighbors and the kids insisted I watch Napoleon Dynamite with them. I did. OK - so I had a laugh or two. When I got home I got on the Internet looked up the movie, read about the dude that played ND. Right now - could not tell you his name (but I remember he was Mormon?)! After seeing Brokeback Mountain I did the same, got on the Internet looked up the stars, etc. First - Jake Gyllenhaal - must be a foreign actor (sounds Danish, Kon Tiki author??). Nope, born in LA. Oops, the listing says October Sky - hey wait a minute - I've seen that one! Rockets, West Virginia (I was born there, probably why I remembered the movie), coal mines...and this guy Gyllenhaal was in *that*?? Guess I was not impressed. Went to the library, checked out the movie. Dude's photo is on the COVER! ! Yep that is him, bit younger, but it's him. Watched the movie - really watching Jake close. Could I have seen the leap from October Sky to Brokeback Mountain?? NEVER in a million years. I was left empty. If you saw early Brando, you could see later Brando, if you get my drift. One scene did make me take notice: Homer (Jake) going down into the mine for his first evening's work. The elevator has a screened top and Homer stares up into the night sky looking at Sputnik. That LOOK, now that WILL show up later in Brokeback Mountain. I'm now at a loss - Jake wasn't what blew me away (Jake the actor or Jake as Jack).Backup and check out the other dude. Heath (after the candy bar?) Ledger. Here again - no bells going off. But wait, again listed is a movie he was in that I've seen. The Patriot. Back to the library, check out the movie. Ah, the curly blond bubblegum-crowd magnet. Acting? P-a-lease. I looked at him when he had black ink all over his teeth and inside his mouth, grinning from ear to ear. I looked at him dying. Nowhere, nowhere could I see the leap from this to Brokeback Mountain. His acting was awesome. But again, it wasn't what blew me away (Heath the actor or Heath as Ennis).Well, it must have been the story. Bought the book by Annie Proulx. I *did* recognize her name. I read a lot, Shipping News. Read the story. It did tell the story, but I can easily comment that had I NOT seen the movie, the story would not have done much for me. The only reason the story worked at all for me was the *experience* of seeing the movie.The music? Bought the CD. Wasn't the music...The director? Seen and liked his other works. Wasn't the director...Etc., Etc.As far as I'm concerned, I was blessed to have witnessed the ""Emotional Big Bang of Movies."" And just like the cosmic Big Bang, searching for the whys may be an exercise in futility. Obviously, a massive synergy has taken place. I want to thank all involved, but to paraphrase a line: ""I wish I could quit Brokeback Mountain.""",Brokeback Mountain
2167,danny_gormally,"A story of diversity portrayed with tenderness, consuming guilt and eternal love!",10,6 February 2006,"Brokeback Mountain isn't a film that aims to 'shove' homosexuality down the audience' throat. Instead its a film that shows how delicate and loving even the most macho of men can be. Heath Ledger carefully plays the role of Ennis, Visually showing the voyage of 'self discovery' that the character goes through in his quest to find happiness. As a member of the audience, you watch closely hoping that this idea of ""forever happiness"" comes true for them. Brokeback Mountain, doesn't preach anything about homosexuality, the issue is broached by other characters furthering how impossible the situation would have been during that era of time. Overall, the story is gripping, it stirs EVERY human emotion during its 2 hour run, leaving the audience with an impression that will (no doubt for me) last for as long as I will remember!

2168,stst01,no quitting,10,6 February 2006,"I probably wont be able to express anything that hasn't already been said in the previous comments but I feel compelled to contribute a few words anyway. I've been living and breathing brokeback mountain these last ten days, grieving, literally mourning, listening to the soundtrack over and over, reading and rereading Annie Proulxs short story, searching the net for pictures, comments, reviews. The experience has been completely unexpected and emotionally draining. The grief eases up from time to time, but just remembering ennis' last words or seeing a wire hanger in the closet brings tears to my eyes. The comments on this site and others at least tell me that I'm not the only one experiencing this madness. An unexpected result is that I find myself suddenly almost reconciled with the US again. A country which can produce such masterpieces can't all be an arrogant Fox-news-bigoted-Tom-O'Reilly-fundamentalist-Bushist post 9/11 nightmare. The American film industry isn't just an entertainment industry, but can also truly be a cultural industry which sometimes produces great works of art. As for the short story, it shows that American authors are still the undisputed masters of this form of fiction. I'll calm down in a few days but right now I can only say: I wish I knew how to quit this film. I wish I knew how to quit this story. Good luck...",Brokeback Mountain

I cannot begin to express well enough how deeply moved I was when I saw BBM. I had read and been extremely moved by the short story, but MY GOD the film was SO powerful. I do not think I had ever been so heartbroken by any story before. I have cried a lot since seeing it, and between the 2 times I saw it. I am not ashamed of it either. To me, Jack and Ennis are real people, not fictional characters at all! If I could see Jake just now,I'd say Hey Jack! Go see Ennis immediately, let him know you are alive after all, I'm sure he's learned his lesson now and the 2 of you can at last be together for good! Of course, I probably feel this way because I could relate to both characters so well, even as a female. I have my own Brokeback Mountain, and visiting the place last summer after 15 years, where my love for another girl bloomed, and was reciprocated,just blew me away. I was lucky enough to be able to get in touch with her again last August, through a friend of a friend. We have now been in contact since. We live in different countries, but there's hope we might meet up next summer. I had broken up with her because the fact she had a boyfriend hurt too much,but never got over her. After seeing BBM I emailed her telling her about the film,and how I had loved her and SHE was my Brokeback memory.

2171,jjbrin,Brokeback Mountain,10,6 February 2006,"I seen Brokeback Mountain for the first time last night. Having heard so much about it I had to see what everyone was talking about. I did not expect to love it like I did.I thought about it all last night and when I woke up this morning I still couldn't shake it from my mind. So, I am going to go see it again tomorrow.I looked this movie up here on this site and read everyone's comments and was so happy to see that it is not just I who have Brokeback on the brain. I was at work all day feeling like I was lost, or missing something, and then realized after reading everyone's comments that what I was feeling was what everyone else was feeling. I was touched by this movie. It is a love story like no other. Someone said it haunted them. That is a very good description. I have never left a movie review before. This movie prompted me to write my very first.Ang Lee, you have a new follower. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal are amazing in this film. A story so bravely told. About longing, love, regret, fear, loss and loneliness. I just have to see it again.",Brokeback Mountain
2172,magikern,Great drama with bottled emotions,9,7 February 2006,"Brokeback mountain is one of the best movies I've seen, with a story that takes hold of you and doesn't let go. Two cowboys in the southern states of USA fall in love. Not the best place to be if you are gay. The characters in the movie are very detailed and the actors do a great job of portaiting men who are masculine, who talk less and act more. The desperation of these characters, uncertain of who they are in a society that doesn't tolerate abnormal persons or behavior, is very touching and I couldn't help but shedding some tears for the star-crossed lovers that actually feels anchored in the real world, without ""thy"", ""thine"" and all that (Romeo and Juliet). But the story isn't only about two cowboys but also about the persons around them that in one way or another get's involved in their lives. Their wives, their children, their parents all play smaller or larger roles in painting the picture that was, and in many cases still is, USA.",Brokeback Mountain
2173,magic_number01,Wow!!,10,7 February 2006,"Before I watched this film and after watching the trailer on the television I was so excited about seeing it. I went to see it the Saturday after the Friday it came out and I was taken aback It is a truly emotional and beautiful film, it even make me a bit choked up, i thought i was going to cry. I think this is one of the best films of all time and most certainly it will be one of the top films of 2006. Jake Gyllenhaal is superb as Jack Twist, who tries to find comfort and a sort of substitute to his male lover in sleeping with a male prostitute in Mexico. Heath Ledger's Accent is spot on, that is exactly the right tone and everything, I could listen to that voice all day. Those two together is a masterpiece and I truly wanted them to get together in the end. It's a real love story, one of the best love stories of all time.",Brokeback Mountain
2174,mell1950,Best thing about this movie was the scenery,2,7 February 2006,"I did not like the comparison of the homosexual relationships being so free and bright whereas the married relationships were all filmed dark and abusive. I am not a homophobia as a matter of fact I am friends with a number of members of the gay community. I have no problem with their lifestyle, it is their own. I have a problem with the way it is portrayed in this film. The cinematography was magnificent and the story line COULD have been very effective but the method of portraying the relationship could have been done more effectively. I realize that my comments on this film will create a storm of criticism but it is my opinion.I rate this film right up there with Titanic. --- Lousy !!!",Brokeback Mountain
2175,bewizeguys,It's all about LOVE,10,7 February 2006,"Brokeback Mountain was a reason to look deep inside myself and realize that love is an unpredictable and overpowering force that you don't ask for, it just takes hold of your entire being. Few people ever get to love or be loved with the same intensity as Jake and Ennis showed for each other. This is a modern Romeo and Juliette without regard for gender. The theme is universal, but many have never seen or experienced what a man's love for another man can be like. This movie is an eye opener and a heart opener if you let the emotion of love enter your soul. It takes you through the full range of human emotion, so much so that you are sure to hear the hearts of the audience breaking and feel the tears flowing. And you find that this reaction is also happening to you. The film has haunted me for days after I viewed it. I can't seem to let go of it. This has never happened to me before. So open your heart and mind and you will be in for a one of a kind movie of a lifetime.",Brokeback Mountain
2176,dark_psydancer,Completely Broken,10,9 February 2006,"Like many before me have put in this box, this experience (and I use the word intentionally as opposed to 'film or 'movie') is one of the most emotionally moving events I have ever been through.Ang Lee has painted a picture with Proulx's words and created a truly breathtaking film that surpasses any controversy the subject matter could cause; Brokeback Mountain is a love story that would be no less effective if it were a heterosexual couple kept apart by another of society's prejudicial 'rules'.It's Heath's film. His performance is really outstanding and the best, in my opinion, by a male in a long while. You feel for him, with him and against him when he doesn't do what you really want him to as if he were a friend of yours. He conveys Ennis's complex feelings with real power and conviction.Although Jake has not been as raved about as much as Heath, he is just as powerful a player in this film. Just as much, if not more, a victim of the events as Ennis, you ache at his longing for the life he desires with the one he loves.Michelle and Anne in the female roles are just as breathtaking in their performances. You can't help but feel for them, even though in a way, you hate them for being the 'substitutes' for what Ennis and Jack really desire.I won't linger on the content or how it's affected society, etc, but I will say that I am glad that the film that has brought the issues addressed in BM into everyday conversations and into the heart and face of society is an outstanding one. I've no doubt (or perhaps naive hope) that it will, hopefully, affect some people who need affecting.Brokeback is without a doubt, the most painful and lingering film I have ever seen and I easily rate it as one of my favourites, though it affected me so much that I'm not sure I'll ever be able to watch it again. I actually found myself having to grieve over what happened, for the death of Jack, and the pain and anguish of the two protagonists and the fact they never got to have the relationship and life they truly yearned for.Ang Lee has created a masterpiece, that deserves to linger in memory and as a landmark in history and it deserves all the praise and plaudits it gets.",Brokeback Mountain
2177,sly-mr-tumnus,This is a moving and powerful film.,10,8 February 2006,"I found this film so gut-wrenchingly moving. I could not think straight for the next 24 hours. It had the most palpable sense of true and deep love that I have ever seen in a movie. Having people write it off as ""the gay cowboy film"" totally under-values the real emotional depth that it portrays. The concept of their sexuality is not the be all and end all of the film's intent. It presents ultimately impassable hurdles, but the emotional journey of the characters and the pain of their situation is independent of the fact that they're gay.This film is wonderfully acted. Ledger and Gyllenhaal are totally convincing as the characters they portray. I think having two well-known straight men in the lead roles hopefully aids in people's acceptance of the concept of gay love - it is less of a black/white situation of a straight audience watching gay actors.This film is very important.",Brokeback Mountain
2178,jaime681,If only I should come to feel a love like that,10,29 March 2006,"I posted this review in another forum but I also want to leave it here. This movie is brilliant. The first time I saw Brokeback Mountain, I left the movie theater in a dazed state, trying to digest what I just had seen. Wondering through some crowded streets of NYC on a cold, windy winter night, I never felt more alone. I hurried home.Many movies have left me excited, intrigued and sad. But none have left me as emotionally devastated as Brokeback has. It's as if the movie insinuated itself around my very soul and wrapped its grief around my unsuspecting heart  leaving it heartbroken ever since. The beauty of this movie is that it makes the characters seem so real, so live and their pain so raw, that the sorrow that permeates the story  hinted at first in the display of the most beautiful desolated sceneries, together with a melancholic music score, sneaks in your head, and unknowingly but quite forcefully takes hold of your body and soul and never seems to let them go.A few weeks later, after countless sleepless nights, unable to shake myself off this stupor, I saw BBM again. This time I left feeling better because it became clear to me that what I had just witnessed was one of the most beautiful love stories ever told. It doesn't matter for me that it happened to be between 2 men. Because there is something so refreshing, so innocent, so lovely about how the story unfolds, that it literally turned this quite jaded, a bit cynical New Yorker, inside out. But I gather that this movie is not meant for everyone. Considering the state of our world today, how we are brought up to fend for ourselves and how we are taught to never let our guards down, we shield our fragile selves from any hint of perceived emotional threats. And we shut down. But I guarantee 100% that if only you could keep the cynicism at bay for the length of this movie, it will transform you. Like I mention before, this movie really makes you hurt, a heartbreaking SOB of a love story that just kills you, but it can be life changing.Both Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger are phenomenal. Period. This movie wouldn't work if either one of them didn't give his heart and soul completely. What a remarkable screen performance these two give  a performance dug directly from the heart. Amazing. Some criticize that the characters don't develop enough rapport before that first scene in the tent. Nonsense. Haven't you ever heard of something called instant chemistry? And both Heath L. and Jake G. deliver throughout the movie. I bow my head to these guys. Of course the movie wouldn't work either without the great, touching performances from Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway and Roberta Maxwell.This was a wonderful work from Ang Lee. To portray this movie in such a delicate, sensitive way merits all ovations it gets. During an interview, Ang Lee said that when casting, he decided to go after young and innocent. That choice has really paid off here because in a way that's why the movie works: because to find love when one is so young, so innocent, that is the purest kind of love. When tragedy hits later on the movie, and somehow we kind of expect that from the start, the only thing that remains out of this now flawed, resentful relationship is a sense of love. But Jack and Ennis' souls have been irremediably broken.Alas, this is the price these doomed individuals pay for living a life denied and full of lies. The soul dies first before physical death occurs. We see it happen in Jack's case, his soul dying, so touchingly captured in his mournful, dead blank eyes at their last fateful meeting when he watches Ennis' truck speed away. He bitterly tells Ennis: ""We could've had a good life togetherbut YOU didn't want itso Brokeback is all we got"" finally letting all his resentment spill out on their most unsatisfactory relationship. To which Ennis replies, accusingly, angrily: ""It's because of you Jackthat I'm like thisI'm nothingI'm nowhere"" before collapsing to the ground as if the weight of this impossible affair suddenly becomes too heavy a burden for him to carry. Jack rushes back to comfort him, and they hug mightily, desperately clinging to one another for they know that they have reached some crossroads in their hearts - their relationship hanging by a thread, they cannot help but watch it slip away. To his part, Ennis fares no better. When we last see him, alone in that empty, desolated trailer, surveying those shirts that he now tenderly guards, he swears love to a man that no longer exists but in his dreams and memories - a late cry of acknowledgment for what he always felt but never dare to express verbally during those long 20 years. And like the emptiness of his trailer, Ennis' soul, so long tormented about a crime he saw as a child and so terrified by the notion that the love of his life was another man, cries in despair for a love forever lost, and it is now destined to wither away in solitary confinement.Thus, the tragedy and paradox of Brokeback Mountain: Love can help save a man from destroying a life that could have been but a man cannot save himself if love is left buried and hidden in the deepest corner of the human heart. Something has to give. So Jack and Ennis: if only I should come to feel a love like that, God help me, but I for one will not hold back. Thank you for showing me the reason why.",Brokeback Mountain
2179,m-mazzola,Overwhelming!,10,11 February 2006,"Halfway through the viewing of this film I realized that I was witness to something very unique and very special. This was much more than just a film. I left the theater feeling emotionally drained with a sadness that was ineffable. Certain scenes played back in my mind over and over again, day after day. I told everyone I knew to see this film, they had to experience what I had. I started judging people by how they viewed BBM. Brokeback Mountain is a cinematic gift to mankind. What was not said being as important as what was. I think that only a bitter and selfish human being would not be moved by this most wonderful story. The commitment of the actors to this work was manifest in superb and utterly believable performances. Heath and Jake were brave to take it on. Michelle and Anne were wonderful in their supporting roles. Randy Quaid, Jake's mom and dad, all the supporting cast were played magnificently. Never in all my life, in any movie, have I felt so jolted as when Ennis opens the door to Jack's room. What Jack Twist had to overcome in his young life broke my heart. Ang Lee, what can I say but thank you for bringing this story to life and for your restraint in filming it. You who had all the tools of Hollywood at your disposal, yet you chose not to use special effects, no gratuitous nudity, just a pure and simple tale of love and human emotions. Love is indeed a force of nature. BBM is a lesson in how to live your life, and a film whose message will change us all for the better. Brokeback Mountain is above any award that Hollywood or any other entity could bestow upon it; it would be like shining a light on the sun. Brokeback Mountain will live on as a brilliant cinematic achievement that effected millions of human hearts and minds and will continue to do so long after we are gone.",Brokeback Mountain
2180,rj-ferenc,Deepest thanks to Ang Lee,10,10 February 2006,"An open letter to Ang Lee------- This is an historic first for me---- in nearly 60 years of life, I have never been so compelled to respond to the creator of an artwork that has so deeply affected me. Of course, I know that the full creation of this astounding and monumental film was a collaborative effort, especially between yourself, Larry McMurtry, Diana Ossana and certainly Annie Proulx, but I can't help but feel my most heart-felt thanks should go to you! Ang,I can't begin to say how, moment-after-moment, line-after-line, the film tore at my heart--- and gut. The experience of watching it was so like having my own life up there on the screen, that the empathy I felt literally left me shaking! The honesty, simplicity, courage, and remarkable---- almost extra-sensory---- insight you have into human nature, and have so eloquently expressed, are just breath-taking! I have never been so moved to send a letter of profound gratitude to someone who has so opened a window in my life, but that is exactly what I am offering to you, now. This is certainly not to diminish the incomparable acting of Jake Gylenhall, and most certainly of Heath Ledger, but acknowledges that such performances are drawn from gifted actors by at least equally (or more-so, in my opinion) gifted directors. So, thank you, Ang, thank you, thank you.As I left the theater, with tears streaming down my face, I was strangely unashamed to confront----and realize the feelings I had held within for so many years were not only shared, but so well articulated by the creators of this achingly beautiful artwork. Yet, I was also puzzled how those creators could have so sensitively told this story without what I assumed must have been similar first-person experiences. Then, after I got home, and searching for some relief from the on-rush of thoughts and feelings I have never experienced from ""just watching a movie"" before, I went to the Internet. There, as I saw the reactions of others worldwide (especially on the IMDb website), the mind-numbing revelations came on me again, wave-after-wave. I felt at once comforted, and relieved, that so many (men and women, gay and straight) also expressed having very similar reactions, but a bit taken-aback at the same time---- it's both relieving and unnerving when we realize we aren't uniquely isolated in the sea of humanity! This whole experience has been such an epiphany for me, that I was able to share my feelings with my wife of 34 years, like I have never done before.I wish there were some way I could ensure that you get the Academy Award for this film, which you so richly deserve. Unfortunately, as we all know, many a-twist-offate can occur in these events, and there is a very real possibility of disappointment. At least let me add my voice to the thousands that are rising in adulation to you for having touched the human psyche in a way that has so seldomly been so successfully achieved!",Brokeback Mountain

That has happened three times in my life: A Clockwork Orange, American Beauty and Brokeback Mountain.How many movies stay with you for days? That has happened four times to me: Add The Exorcist to the above list.This is a breakthrough movie if you have ever felt alone or couldn't live your love. I just don't think it can leave you indifferent if you go to watch the stories.And one can't ignore the acting of particularly Heath Ledger. The accent, the gut-wrenching scene when he leaves Jack the first time, was brilliant acting. His Ennis Del Mar was so real to me that I want to see a sequel to his life, to see how he lives his dilemma. I only hope this isn't the end of Brokeback Mountain and Ennis Del Mar.

2182,g_baumgart,Enjoyed movie but was disappointed again,7,8 February 2006,"I agree the movie is visually stunning. I was drawn into the story even though I felt it began too slow. I was disappointed that the movie really did not go far enough into the ""true"" relationship of the main characters. I know I have seen the same reasons in other movies about the gay relationship. I would have enjoyed the movie more if the people would have evolved after twenty years. The main characters were still young enough to have enjoyed a long healthy relationship. Why does one of the gay characters always have to have a bad ending. I would have enjoyed the movie better if the author and director had taken more chances and not played it safe. If this movie wishes to win an Oscar, I believe it should have done more...much more. I do not feel this film advances the concept of ""love.""",Brokeback Mountain

I had to admit that, Harry Potter and King Kong are fine too, but once we left the theater we soon forgot about them. Brokeback Mountain is the only one that keeps in our minds for weeks and we are still talking about it: the characters, the dialogs, and the ending.There are some questions left unanswered in this movie, but that's the beauty of it. Many blockbuster films dazzled our eyes with their special effects. They also turned off our imagination. Brokeback Mountain makes our brains alive.",Brokeback Mountain
2184,dinokralj,Simply beautiful,10,10 February 2006,"Well, I have to say that I was expecting a good movie but I really wasn't prepared for this! I saw the movie yesterday and I still can't get it out of my mind, and I won't get it out for a long time. I come from Croatia and talking about gays or gay love is just something you don't do. I'm straight but still deeply moved by this movie. And I am so sorry that not many people are going to see it. The first part of the movie for me was a nice story, watching two guys having fun their own way, enjoying the time together at a place were they can feel free. At first I didn't understand what was it about Ennis feeling sick after returning from the mountain and letting Jack leave just like that, but after the whole movie, I know exactly what was that and how hard it really was. The second part, after they meet again after four years is a real heart-breaker. The emotions, looks, sadness, guilt, love, pain, it all there. I tried not to get too emotional, and not to cry, but I just couldn't! You have to feel sad, you just have to! And angry of the whole world for being what it is. I am so sorry that my English is not that good and I can't really express everything that I'm feeling about this movie, but one thing is sure, it changed my way of thinking, and it changed my life for sure. Thank you Ang Lee, and thanks to the whole cast. Heath Ledger is really phenomenal there, and I really wish him an Oscar! He deserved it!",Brokeback Mountain
2185,agy-6,everybody should watch it,10,9 February 2006,"I watched the movie on Sunday and it's already Thursday, but I don't seem to manage the overwhelming flow of feelings! The movie is never compromising; there is no scene that the audience would like to have seem, for example, ashes being scattered in Brokeback Mountain... nothing. It's layers makes you go deep into your inner soul and you just want to rejoice in this feeling, like a drink that you would like to sip slowly! Rarely has this happened in a movie. Ang Lee knows how to tell a love story, that was put to test with Crouching Tiger, another one-of-a-kind movie. Watching either of these films is just like going to a museum, sit alone, enjoying your own company. Agy",Brokeback Mountain

I've read the book (or parts of it) every night since then. I've also told just about everyone I know about this movie, and that they should see it. It is a wonderful movie, about the choices we make in life and all the fallout that comes with those choices. There was no pat Hollywood ending--sometimes you don't get the guy (or girl). Don't over-analyze the character's motives or lack of--you'll just drive yourself crazy. Take it as it is, a great movie that has us all talking. This is one movie I will get on DVD when it comes out. Ranks up there with the Big Chill, though both are about totally different subjects.",Brokeback Mountain

2188,iwonderynot,"Fine directing and acting, but predictable",6,9 February 2006,"Decent but not worth all the hoo-hah, particularly in terms of the writing. Was very predictable and therefore I couldn't get too attached to the characters and wasn't very moved. Seemed to rely too much on the scenery and music to bring out the emotion, and it didn't work for me. Also, I was annoyed by the mumbling of the character Ennis -- I missed about half his lines. Seems to me there is some strange bias for this film because of the combination of the ""controversial"" subject matter (which I think doesn't seem all that controversial to younger generations like me) combined with a sense of Americana sentiment that is supposed to draw a tear, but definitely didn't for me and I usually cry at the drop of a hat.",Brokeback Mountain

The location which they used for Brokeback Mountain was awesome (I love mountains) and the story, as it unfolds, touched my heart. Like many others (I am sure) I ended up crying at the end of the movie.It's not so much a 'gay' movie but really one about the wonderful bond between 2 persons who happen to be men. I feel for them, thinking what it must be like in those days or places where they would be discriminated against, having to hide their love for one another and the relationship from the judgemental eyes of their world, and their dealings with the angst that any couple relationship brings.It really is a beautiful movie! Well done!",Brokeback Mountain
2190,BrnEdn,One of the best produced in a very long time,10,10 February 2006,"While Brokeback Mountain is a very controversial film (when it first came to Charlotte, it was only at one theater...soon it was at three...now it is showing at all the theaters in this area), it is truly one of the best I've seen in quite some time. The usual run of movies doesn't keep my interest, I leave the theater shaking my head and wondering why I came, or I just think about going and decide it isn't worth my time. This was a WONDERFUL movie...insightful, moving...truly a work of art! I think it portrays real human beings with real emotions...trying very hard to understand those emotions and come to terms with them. If, for just a few minutes, those who have a problem with the homosexual content, could forget that part...just see the raw, human emotions being portrayed...and see the depth of love ...well, I think they just might realize that it is truly a great film!",Brokeback Mountain
2191,farah_wardani,"The Movie Changes Hollywood (well, hopefully)",10,22 March 2006,"I saw this film two weeks ago and it's still haunting me. I cannot summarize all the wonderful things that many have said about this movie here but for everyone who votes this as a 10, I just want to say that I absolutely agree with you. Won't give away no more plot lines, spoilers, favorite scenes, praises of direction or performances or anything. The whole movie just works. Period.For those who dislike it, well I would just say that I kind of understand why it might not please all tastes. One crucial factor that is obvious, of course, is its subject matter, yes yes we do still have to deal with this troubled world today. However, if that issue is put aside, I also see that another thing is that this film is not your typical Hollywood adrenaline-fest or formulaic type of movie  it's anything remote from that. It has the appeal of an art-house film for its huge artistic quality, but also not like those artsy, too-hip-for-everyone cult films (which include also some of the 'hippest' queer films that I've seen) either. It is more mundane and subtle. The film reminds me so much of the genuine charm of soulful Asian dramas such as Zhang Yimou's Raise The Red Lantern or Iranian Majid Majidi's Baran  though at the same time also still very American substantially and atmospherically. It mixes visual poetics of the setting, landscapes and performances with simple dialog in linear, solid storytelling in a slow-paced rhythm that builds up increasingly growing tension and emotions towards the climax. And more importantly, the filmmakers made the films by baring their soul, and it can be felt throughout the movie. The movie enters the audience quietly, taking time to haunt and finally stays for a long time afterward. It is a small yet sophisticated treat and its aftertaste lingers for a long time, unlike the usual 'big, greasy junk food' coming from Hollywood. And that also explains, of course, why it doesn't appeal for all tastes. For many, as it appears here, it is a wonderful, precious experience. Yet for some others, it may leave a bad taste in their mouth. It's just that the hype and controversy surrounding the film are very strong, everyone seems to have high expectations upon it, and I believe at the same time there are also some who actually look forward to bash the film when seeing it (or not!). As for those who think that this film is overrated (mostly by saying it to be too slow, plain and weepy), I don't want to say that they are wrong, but more likely that the movie might just not be their cup of tea. Well, suit yourself, but as a passionate movie buff, I have to say that Brokeback's DEFINITELY got me good. It is a wonderful film, pure and simple yet multi-layered, that kind of film that I certainly will fall in love with instantly, even if all the hypes, the controversy and the award race don't exist. And I'm a heterosexual, Muslim Indonesian female  I don't relate myself to the 'issues' or to the cultural setting, but I treasure the film for its artistry, and ultimately relate to the universally essential matters the film conveys: love, life, desire, reality, repression, gender roles, identity and all their complexities, subtly composed altogether creating both emotional and intellectual piece that really strikes right to the heart and mind. And that also shows the greatness of cinema as a powerful, universal medium. I do feel a bit irritated with the Oscar-snub controversy, but funnily also kind of relieved as well actually why? Well, who cares about the Oscars really? If anyone would say this is an overrated film, well I just want to say that the Academy Awards have always been an overrated event and as time passes by it has been increasingly losing its credibility as a parameter of judgment of the world's best films, parallel with the way Hollywood just goes more and more down the drain with same stuff being produced over and over again. In Indonesia, the cinema is still seen and treated as an exclusive medium in this manic TV culture here, but the growing interest in movies within the society has been increasing rapidly these recent years, most likely supported by the VCD/DVD revolution and the reawakened local film industry. Hollywood  though still dominating/ monopolizing the market, has been slowly losing its grip. Many of movie buffs would prefer seeing the latest cool Chinese/HK flicks, the new wave of Japanese/Korean/Thai cinema that has become more and more popular, unique films from Europe or the UK, and many more that won't be noticed by the Oscars  unless it has 'issues', got enough budget to be distributed in the US, or already nominated in Cannes. The Oscars has always been ignorant and it just never lets go its bloated Hollywood self-importance. So why bother? The way Brokeback got snubbed just justifies that fact. And also validates the movie as a stand-alone winner. It is one of the greatest gifts given to Hollywood since a long while, and it is being dismissed. But what to expect? Now, can we just get over it or might as well sneer gleefully about that fact, and just get down to the excitement of waiting for the Brokeback's DVD that will come out this April? Just hope that Hollywood will learn from this and start to make more movies in the same quality as Brokeback in the future  let's just see.",Brokeback Mountain
2192,brinzezza92,Brokeback Mountain - Short review,10,11 February 2006,"Oh my God. This movie is so brilliant, so awesome. I can say that I love it. Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger were good at Jack and Ennis. Also other actors were good. Ang Lee is very, very smart man because he directed this film. Direction succeeded very good! Thanks to him very, very, very much! This movie was very moving. I think that Brokeback Mountain deserves all eight Oscars. All of people must see this film, it's so able film. I haven't ever seen better film than Brokeback Mountain is. I can't understand people who don't like this film. People must win their assumptions and go to watch this movie.This movie deserves 10 points!",Brokeback Mountain

2194,mfryer7,Average film - a pity about all the hype,6,12 February 2006,"This film is over-long and over-rated. Although the photography was great and the subject matter interesting, the film was just too long. It was a pity that the character of Alma was not developed a bit more. I am sure most wives would have a lot more to say about their husband's sexuality than she did, and really the length of the film would surely have allowed this. For me, it was a mediocre love story that missed the opportunity to do so much more with the material. I did enjoy watching the photography of the landscape and I found it interesting that it was set in the era chosen. I can't help thinking that the subject matter overtook all the other things that are needed in making a great film.",Brokeback Mountain
2195,ccnogueira,"Love is a force of nature, so is the fear of its consequences",10,12 February 2006,"My English is not good enough, but right now I *HAVE* to leave a comment (never left any comments before, obviously due to my limited English skills).I *LOVED* this movie and I intend to see it again next weekend. It's a love story. Just a common love story. But it delivers well its point: how people sometimes don't allow themselves to be happy because of fears, guilt, insecurities, conventions and also HOW SOCIETY DEPRIVES SO MANY OF HAPPINESS BECAUSE OF ITS MERCILESS CONVENTIONS, PREJUDICES, INTOLERANCE AND AGGRESSIONS.Then the movie confronts us with a perverse paradox. Jack (Gyllenhaal) and Ennis (Ledger), just like so very many people I know (homo or heterosexual), end up giving nothing but crumbs to the most important things in their lives. Crumbs of time, crumbs of love. That what is most important emotionally gets, in practical terms, leftovers. And this phenomenon described above doesn't do anyone any good. Take the wives, for example. Their unhappiness is almost palpable, so deep it is. What's it worth being married to someone who loves someone else?Another aspect that caught my attention in this movie was: timing! It's no use whatsoever to decide to fight for something only after that something has been already irreversibly lost. Check out the last scene: Ennis (Ledger) alone, after receiving a visit from his daughter (who, by the way, loves him just the way he is). She leaves and he opens the door of his wardrobe where a dirty blouse of Jack's is hanging, and where we can also see a postcard that Jack wrote him. He looks sad, devastated, hopeless and aching so much as he mumbles something like: ""oh, Jack, you know, I swear..."", and doesn't finish his sentence. Promises! Promises that are now useless because the other is dead and you won't be able to live up to them anyways. Promises that could have been made earlier, promises that could have been fulfilled earlier, EARLIER, changing, MAYBE, the entire course of the story of both their lives... And of the lives of people close to them.I understand Ennis so bad that it hurts. And at the same time I don't understand him at all. Perhaps Ennis' fears would confirm themselves and he would end up like that (mutilated, tortured and assassinated) guy his father showed him (as an educative lesson - ARGH!) when he and his brother were just a couple of little kids. Perhaps he would have ended up beaten-up to death like Jack (Gyllenhaal). Maybe, perhaps, maybe... We will never know. Ennis will never know. But the irony is that, again Ennis, the so-called survivor here, is probably feeling just as dead, tortured and mutilated as those who actually passed away for good. IF NOTHING ELSE, LOVE IS WORTH DYING FOR AND EVEN WORTHIER LIVING FOR. PEOPLE SHOULDN'T DENY THEMSELVES AND ESPECIALLY THEY SHOULDN'T BE DENIED THAT RIGHT.",Brokeback Mountain
2196,alc252,Surprising,10,12 February 2006,"I went to see this movie, not so much because I was THAT interested in it but, because the reviews were so good that I thought ""why not? good way to spend a Friday afternoon."" I liked the movie after I left the theater and then 2 days later realized that I was still thinking about it and REALLY wanted to see it again. I was not expecting anything when I went to see it, didn't have any preconceived ideas (other than I had heard it was really good)and had not heard any of the ""spoilers"" so I was VERY surprised by my own reaction. I have since taken my sister and my 15 year old niece to see it and both have had the same reaction. You cannot stop thinking or feeling about these characters.I know a lot of people who get caught up in ""it's a gay cowboy movie"". That is like saying Titanic is about a boat. This movie is so much more than that. It is one of the most moving, realistic and gut-wrenching love stories that I have ever seen. That people feel that they cannot, or will not, follow their hearts because of fear, guilt, societal expectations/ignorance, etc is something that happens all of the time and is heart-breaking. Being denied the right (by others & by himself) to love turned Ennis into a lonely and sad man who was never able to find his way. In his marriage, with his children, in any other relationship outside of he & Jack's (and, even then, he couldn't be completely happy).To anyone who has not seen this movie, keep an open mind and heart, and be prepared to be surprised by the level of emotion and connectedness that you will feel for these characters. Heath Ledger is absolutely amazing in his shock at what he feels for another man, in his loneliness that you can see getting worse every year and eventually in his pain and loss that you are able to actually feel FOR him. Jake Gyllenhaal can give a look that makes your heart jump into your throat. You can feel the longing and the wish for more. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway are great. They both have very different ways of showing how it feels to try to create a life with someone who will never love you in the way that they love another. The physical beauty of this movie will also take your breath away. Ang Lee has a way of filming a scene that may not have any actors in it at all but will still make you feel.I cannot say anything negative about this movie. I have become obsessed with it and wish I could see it every day. I only hope they don't wait too long to bring it to DVD.",Brokeback Mountain

I was thrilled because all the news and comments on this piece of movie work. Precedents of director's accomplishments set me free from malicious preventions about the film. Though about the story I was anxious because I'got the intuition to be on the edge as a witness of the screening of a very tale of two hunks felt in love for each other. What a fantasy for the newborn gay people. What a memory for all of us who were morally killed before our family and friends and pals at school and the girls out there felt in love for us. The movie started and I saw two lone rangers waiting for an opportunity to work in the best they could without thinking to much about it. Two rough and poor and no-future men who are missioned to lead a huge bunch of sheep. My eyes were taken all through a shaped, vast and chilling landscape. Over the slope the two men were in charge. They looked after the sheep day and night. The nights were colder, of course. And this open the turn to laid down one very close to the other in search for the warm that only the friction of two strong bodies can give off. A discovery is made. The cheerful morning awakes them embraced. There will be no decanting of facts or rationalizing of feelings. Thanks God! Things will be that way for almost 20 years. Lives will be lead by the normal channels of life they were meant to be. A crime will be set upon these pure lives. The daily despair of being caught.

The filming of the scenery will make you want to go out west and climb the mountains. You'll want to eat beans, ride horses, herd sheep, and make love. What is so extraordinary about this movie is that while watching you forget that it is a homosexual love story. The love between them seems so real and wonderful that being biased against gays is not an option. Being of High School age in a town that still holds conservative views, I encourage all people my age to get out and see this movie.

I went to the movies with friends expecting to see another gay-themed movie with nothing more than witty one-liners, bad acting, and out dated stereotypes. Brokeback Mountian contained none of the above. Jake and Heath, who are both straight, performed roles that I'm sure most straight actors would shy away from. They pulled it off so well, that one actually believes they are in love. I admit, that I'm pretty much a stone when it comes to emotional movies, but when Ennis found his bloody shirt in Jack's closet, I lost it. Never in my years of movie-going have I seen a movie that has left me feeling affected days later. This movie was not about picking a political agenda and shoving it down your throat. It's simply a well told story about the lives of two men, and what it may be like... to feel forced into a life for the sake of society, that neither is truly happy with. It's about wanting what you can't have, unexpectedly falling in love, loss, and regret.Brokeback Mountian is a must see, whether straight or gay.

It's like Anna Karenina all over again. It's a cheap attempt to make people feel guilty about their homophobic feelings. I really think that the emperor has no clothes.

When i saw the trailer on TV, one thing that catches my attention was ""oh! another cowboy movie"", which I'm fond of watching such films..western style.. but when i read the synopsis, i was amazed and realized.. it's indeed a love story of two cowboys, Jack and Ennis..( take note that i haven't still watch the movie yet..) so it really excites me..so when February 14 comes, Day of Love.. after, i finally saw it on a certain theater here in the Philippines.. i really burst out my tears and i can't resist it, it's inevitable.. it's a deeply felt, emotional love story that deals with the uncharted, mysterious ways of the human heart just as so many mainstream films have before it. The two lovers here just happen to be men.. this story of suppressed passion of irrespective of gender considerations a deeply moving, indeed lacerating film..

2203,azpricklypair,A strong love that ain't so strong,7,14 February 2006,"I thought this was a wonderful and moving film about forbidden love and intolerance, however at the same time, as a 53 year old gay man, I would like to point out that this is also a film about two gay men who didn't have the strength to come out of the closet and fight for their relationship. The fact is, while these two characters were ""struggling"" with their ""secret"" love for each other, there were other gay men (and women) during the 1960's and 1970's who risked everything (rejection from family and friends, discrimination in housing and the workplace, mental and physical abuse, danger to their very beings) to openly love each other and to find a way to make their relationships work, but Hollywood doesn't make movies about these brave people. Rather we have a film about two sad and tragic characters who's love was not strong enough to keep them together.

Some people have said the story is simple, with little action, but I disagree. Actually the tortuous way in which the two guys' relationship unfolds, and the effect it has on all the other characters, is very complex. Who can begrudge Heath Ledger an Oscar for his outstanding performance, with all the nuances and naturalness of a Jack Nicholson, for example. The cinematography of the scenes on the mountain itself is also important, as the sweeping vistas hint at the equally vast landscapes of the soul, and their equivalent beauty. Nothing could have prepared me for the power, intensity and honesty of this film: it will live with me for a long time afterward.",Brokeback Mountain
2205,number6-15,Hard to find a flaw in this movie,10,14 February 2006,"I rarely go to see a movie more than once but I have in this case. For me, many things worked extremely well. No one, not Annie Proulx, the screenwriters, the director or the actors treat the audience as if they were unable to think for themselves. Many questions are left to the audience, spurring on more discussions than I have had than with any other movie in recent memory.The visual touches amaze me. I do think this will spoil anything for anyone, I love how at the beginning of the film you see a truck in near darkness traveling across a dramatic landscape from the right side of the screen to the left. At the end you see a truck traveling in near darkness traveling across the same dramatic landscape from the left side of the screen to the right. A moving inescapably towards something and then inescapably away. These two scenes now blow me away as much as any with dialog.

Anyone who has ever had a discrete relationship can understand, such as different racial/cultural backgrounds, religious differences, social statuses, families' disputations, age gaps, and so on. Society tells us that certain relationships are wrong and unacceptable, that's why some people who are engaged in these relationships keep it a secret.""Brokeback Mountain"" pin pointed out this forbidden love. Like ""Romeo and Juliet,"" tragedy breaks out. Finally, a ""gay romance"" film which *Isn't* stereotypical ""faggoty or feminine-like,"" compared to most others out there! Because of this, the audiences aren't just gays, less homo-phobic attitudes, and more open minded. I'm pretty sure this is the first of its kind to go mainstream in America's theatres, and i hope this is the lead ice breaker for others to follow. This film isn't just romance or western, its also comedy, action, drama, and suspense. I commend Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger's performances. Before this project, i thought they were both just any other pretty boys that are not Oscar material. I never even seen a single film by Jake Gyllenhaal previously. In this film, they're break out actors, and the new journey has began. However, there's just a tiny downside; Heath Ledger's acting was just a tad too stiff during the entire film. Jake's performance was flawless, (*and being drop dead gorgeous didn't hurt either* ;)!.) ""I wish i knew how to quit him*"" now, lol.This film makes you want to be in a relationship just to have someone special. You feel as if you're missing someone, even though you might not know who it is. The first thing i did when i got home was I hugged my dog tightly! (I know, that was pathetic.)

The screenplay, written by Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana, is not only true to Ms. Proulx's short story, it gives a bit more depth to several of the other characters in the film.This is NOT a 'gay cowboy' movie. It's about two men that develop feelings they don't quite fully understand, so they deal with their situation the best (and safest)way they know how over a twenty year period. How their secret relationship affects them and their spouses and children is subtly revealed throughout the film. I think one of the main reasons so many people are talking about this film is that it raises more questions than it answers.This film is also NOT a political, religious or 'lifestyle' statement. It doesn't promote any agenda, despite all the rhetoric from both extremes of the 'liberal' & 'conservative' spectrum. It's a film that illustrates how environment and social conditions affect the choices we make and the paths we take concerning those we love can impact us all our lives.""Brokeback Mountain"" is a simple, yet powerful film. Go see the movie. Read the short story. If you aren't left with a lump in your throat or an ache in your gut, you weren't paying attention.",Brokeback Mountain
2208,Sheyne,"Brokeback got us good, don't it? - Jack Twist",10,14 February 2006,"Oh wow.. I know I credited Jack Twist with the above quote, but at this point, I think it could apply to anybody who has seen it. What IS it about this movie that has got me in tangles?!?! I can't sleep, eating seems kinda empty and time NOT talking about Brokeback is time wasted!! I have never been like this with a film before - EVER. And frankly, out of the 25 pages of submissions I sat through reading last night, I thank god I'm not the only one. I wish I had a dollar for every time I read comments like ""this is the first time I've ever posted a review for a movie"" etc.Including the session I just arrived home from, I have seen Brokeback Mountain a total of 9 times. Not bad, considering it was only released in Australia on the 26th January. Everybody knows the story but for those who want to read my take on it: Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) meet while seeking employment. No words are spoken, only glances that are furtive and sneaky (Ennis) or brazen and inviting (Jack). They herd sheep on Brokeback Mountain and the glances between the men become more frequent and varying in the emotions that drive them. It is an absolute credit to the acting in this film that you can tell exactly what the actor is conveying without words. See if you can spot the sheepishness and embarrassment that fleets across Jack's face as he realizes Ennis is intently watching the mare's attempt to buck him off. It's there. See if you can spot the curiosity that grows with every look Ennis gives Jack. The boys herd sheep, they meet up for meals, they begin to drink a little.And it amazes me that no reviewer has mentioned just how funny the first half hour of the movie is! Here's another one: see if you can spot the mischievous little glint that flashes across Ennis's eyes and mouth before he baits rodeo-rider Jack with the line ""now my daddy, he was a fine roper. Didn't rodeo much though. He thought rodeo cowboys was all ****-ups"". And Jack's indignation giving way to a little impromptu rodeo dance before crashing headlong into all their gear. And Ennis's wry observation ""I think my dad was right"". Wonderful, genre-appropriate humor. And then the drinking which leads to Ennis spending the night down at the campsite before the freezing temperatures force him into the pup-tent with Jack.This starts the whole movie in motion. The boys sexual encounter is quite rough and violent, but something in Jack accepts this is the way Ennis is most comfortable expressing himself. Startling contrast to the tenderness of the following evening, when Jack is the one dominating the encounter. He whispers over and over to the clearly struggling Ennis ""its alright, its alright"" and pulls him into a protective embrace, kissing his hair, his face. The surrender and submission on Ennis's face is something we see rarely for the rest of the movie.The boys separate and marry their women. But their lives are a sham and they know it. The two leads also beautifully convey - again without words - the fact that what they yearn for most is each other.I could talk about this all day, but instead I'm going to cite a few of my favorite moments - the moments that (even after 9 viewings) still make me well-up: 1. The look that crosses Ennis's face as he walks to the window and sees Jack for the first time in 4 years, pulling up in his truck.2. The unrestrained passion of their reunion. They embrace, there's a fire in their eyes, and Ennis takes his lover by the lapels of his vest and shoves him against the wall, knocking his hat off and landing the most intense, breathtaking and passionate kiss I have ever seen in watching 30 years of movies. Bogie and Bacall WISHED they had this kind of intensity and chemistry.3. The 15 - 20 seconds of screen time it takes for you to watch Jack become a broken man. Upon hearing of Ennis's divorce, Jack drives from Texas to Wyoming to surprise him. He is full of life, whistling and smiling. And when he realizes Ennis's divorce doesn't change anything between them and they still can't be together, the sparkle literally disappears from his eyes, his posture sags slightly and his heart breaks. You see it all. I've heard it said: Jake Gyllenhaal has been robbed blind at the spate of recent award ceremonies. This scene and the ensuing scene of him driving away crying is among the finest acting in the film.4. One final image: Ennis sitting at Jack's dining room table, eye-balling Mr Twist, who has just bitterly revealed (without explicitly stating) that he knows his son was gay and that Ennis was his lover. Ennis doesn't respond but he feels the hostility emanating. And then a gentle reassuring hand appears in shot on Ennis's shoulder, from Jack's mother, who also knows but accepts and understands and most importantly, supports.Everybody has already said it but I have to say it again: the acting. Heath is completely brilliant, as is his bevy of supporting women, Michelle Williams, Anne Hathaway and Linda Cardellini. But as far as I'm concerned, this wouldn't have been the film it was without Jake Gyllenhaal. Jack is the heart and soul of this movie.This is a film I am struggling to wean myself off. Its hard sitting through other movies now cause they all pale in comparison. Nothing has ever touched me like this. Its hard to imagine anything will ever again. I know you can't really give a film 15 out of 10 but there you have it. Brokeback got us good? You better believe it.",Brokeback Mountain
2209,tsuribito,Best movie of the Year,10,14 February 2006,"Just when you think Hollywood has rolled over to corporate profits and public pressure along comes Ang Lee and Brokeback Mt. A haunting film of real life and real people with real issues. Its a film about relationships and the decisions we make in life in connection with those relationships. There are always consequences, often good sometimes bad. This film takes on a same sex relationship that enables the viewer, almost effortlessly, to look beyond the perceived stumbling block of same sex romance to see what really matters most. The human search for love and understanding, sometimes it comes to us in ""unconventioanl"" ways. The key is to remain open to the condition for the possibility, despite the risks. Life is too short to and too precious to miss the opportunity to authentically love another. Thats just what Ang Lee has brought to the screen in a thoughtful, delicate and respectful manner. Its a film for all of us, about all if us, one would do well to see it more than once to catch the many nuances that make the film a valid meaningful cinematic experience of self reflection and perhaps discovery and self improvement.",Brokeback Mountain
2210,Yavy,Great scenery too!,10,14 February 2006,"I have to admit the reason I saw this movie is because of the scenery. I moved to Alberta in the summer of 2005 and fell in love with the Rocky mountains, the foothills and the prairies. I saw Brokeback Mountain because I heard parts of it (if not most?)where filmed in Alberta. I knew what the movie was about and had no problem with the heavy theme. But wow! Just like most of the viewers, this movie made a huge impact on me. I loved it! I loved everything about it!Brokeback Mountain is a modern day Romeo and Juliette (or Romeo and Romeo if you prefer). It is one of the sweetest, most romantic and heartbreaking movies that I've seen in a long, long time. It has that ""society won't let you love who you really love"" theme to it which makes it so emotional, passionate and bittersweet.I am a 37 year old straight female and for some reason this movie made me fall in love with the two main characters Ennis and Jack. I'm no big fan of any actor or celebrity but Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal have certainly caught my attention!I have to agree with everybody's comments so far. I haven't read them all but I will and I haven't read any bad reviews yet but the good ones are exactly how I feel about it too. My heart goes out to those people who have experienced this type of lifestyle and heartache. I have too in a different way.I just wanted to add that there are many elements that make this movie spectacular and one of them is the location. Would this movie have done just as well if it was about two stock brokers in New York City? The scenery makes it all that much more beautiful, breathtaking and original!I'm very selective of the movies I see because there aren't too many movies out there that I think are worth seeing in a theater. Brokeback Mountain made me forget I was in a movie theater. It just sucked me right in and made me forget about my world. I cried in my car driving home and like many of you out there, I can't stop thinking about it. I hope I never do.I'm going to see it again in the theater and then buy the DVD when it comes out!",Brokeback Mountain
2211,maajik,Everyone has their own Brokeback Mountain,10,10 March 2006,"Exploiting love as an extremely profitable theme, the film industry has gradually reduced its primal significance to nothing but a couple of hackneyed platitudes. Adapting 'Brokeback Mountain' for the screen, a short story by Annie Proulx, Ang Lee not only breathed new life into the ossified genre, he managed to elevate an intimate relationship between two men to an unprecedented emotional level.The movie tells the story of two young men, Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal), whose paths cross in Wyoming in the summer 1963. Two strangers hired as shepherds are sent onto the harsh slopes of Brokeback Mountain, where after some time they experience an unexpected and sudden burst of affection. What Ennis at first calls 'a one-shot deal' will appear to be the beginning of the long-standing relationship whose symbol will remain the mountain.Ang Lee's movie is a classical, though gay, love story, and consequently the characters are not entitled to love. The fear of the narrow, small town mentality of locals is the reason why Ennis and Jack desperately try to forget about the affection and lead a normal life, getting married and starting families. However, the unfulfilled, secret desires impossible to satisfy become the source of drama.The combination of the picturesque scenery and the outstanding performances given by Ledger and Gyllenhaal substantially contributes to the emotional atmosphere that Lee managed to capture in the film. The high artistic level is not even for a moment eclipsed by the very subtle intimate scenes, whose aim evidently is not to shock but to emphasize the depth of the characters' love. Surprisingly, the fact that two main characters are male makes the story is so meaningful and unpretentious. Watching 'Brokeback Mountain' one cannot resist the impression that such story could really happen.Considered from a broader perspective, the story can serve only as a starting point for more general deliberations on the sense of our fulfilment in life. The inability of liberation from social or cultural constraints may become a human drama and Ennis saying 'If you can't fix it, you gotta stand it' hits the bull's-eye. However, it depends only on ourselves if we really have to stand it.",Brokeback Mountain
2212,claydohs,Brokeback Mountain - Moving,10,16 February 2006,"Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal made this movie ten times better then it was going to be. Their characterization was outstanding, and the supporting ladies really added to the story. No matter any trailer you watch, you cant understand the movie until you really view it. This movie was a real eye opener, and a very humbling experience. What I found particularly amazing, was how the four leads had such amazing accents. These four are really talented. Although, it really shouldn't be open to fourteen year old kids (Only in Canada), the storyline is a bit too mature for that age. The soundtrack was perfect for the movie setting, and I recommend purchasing it. Brokeback Mountain is a life changing movie, and the four actors did a great job.",Brokeback Mountain
2213,Nerjizerbunny,Not all that it's cracked up to be,4,16 February 2006,"BROKEBACK MOUNTAINIf it weren't for the free movie pass I had gotten, I would not likely have seen this.Objectively speaking- I don't think this film deserves the acclaim that it is receiving.The movie was derived from an article in a Magazine.Cinematography was ""ok"", not great...the beautiful backdrop of ""Wyoming"" and or Canada, depending on the scene, provided enough eye candy for the senses, but director Ang Lee provided little else in the way of cinematographic style through any of his direction.Scenes were choppy... the time line of the story jumped form year to year, with viewers only ability to discern from these changes in time, by off screen comments on ""1978 Superbowl"" and a 1975 divorce court date. Beyond slight changes in facial hair, or length of sideburns... the main characters changed clothing almost unoticably- with supporting characters providing the most visual demonstration of period clothing (Wedge heels, tube tops, over dyed blond Farrah Fawcett Hair and the ever present blue eyeliner on female characters).Accents best utilized by supporting cast, fell out of place more so with American actor Jake Gyllenhaal than with one with whom we'd expect, the Australian Heath Ledger.The basic story is one that qualifies for sentiment, and compassion- understanding of a time not so long ago that lead to public scrutiny and death in some cases for those living this ""alternate life""- but this viewer was glad I didn't have to shell out cash for the movie- definitely worth a look see when on cable, but save your cash and let's hope that the Oscar folks don't get ahead of themselves with making a statement for statement sake. Nominated for 8 Oscars. Another 45 wins & 41 nominations Not sure WHAT they were thinking.",Brokeback Mountain
2214,maureenberry57,Devastatingly beautiful love story,10,24 February 2006,"It's been a long time since a film has affected me in this way. It was so beautifully told and so heartbreakingly sad. Love is love and it is truly a force of nature. These two boys (when they met) had no clue that this meeting would change their lives forever. They grew into men and ""accepted"" their lives (at least Ennis did) as for what it HAD to be not what it COULD/SHOULD have been. They knew no better than what life had handed them and never thought of taking each other and making a run as far away from Wyoming as they possibly could. I found it more a love story than anything else. Truly a work of art on the scenery and the direction of these two wonderful actors. It has been in my heart and mind all day....to have had such a love and to never have the opportunity to shout it from the rooftops!",Brokeback Mountain

The sights, sounds and emotions cascading in front of me caught me totally off guard. I have never been in a theatre full of people where no one would even chew popcorn! The moment that sticks in my mind most is at the end where Ennis is standing at the closet with the two shirts, which he has switched and placed his on the outside, and then does up one last button, lovingly strokes the shirts and then says, ""I swear, Jack."" Those three words seem to hold all the anger, frustration, longing and love that Ennis has gone through in his journey with Jack.I was too stunned to cry.",Brokeback Mountain
2216,iv_smart,Brokeback Mountain is what love is all about.,10,16 February 2006,"Brokeback Mountain  It is not about the Wild West, and it is not about sex, and yet it is so powerfully wild and sexy that one's mind goes off when Ennis (Heath Ledger) gets behind Jack (Jake Gyllenhaal) and hugs him gently. It is an epic drama so brilliantly written and directed as if there had been no love before or after.The greatest love is always the most painful. The fact that it is about two ordinary guys makes it even more painful than that. For a man to kneel down and punch the wall in despair while not even knowing what was happening to him, it takes nothing but love. For a man to gently stroke another man's ear in a split of a moment, it takes absolutely nothing but ultimate love.It is a story of any forbidden love. It could be two girls; it could be a woman and a man of different races; it could be anything new, anything that the world does not want to face with. And America in the 60-ies, remote Wyoming countryside is no better. Some of the places in today's modern world are no better.It begins in 1963 when two boys go looking for jobs and end up together for an entire season on Brokeback Mountain. What happens there is inexplicable to both of them but they know it's earthshaking and they cannot stop it. Do they want to? Jack certainly does not. He is the outgoing one, the braver one, the one who is willing to embark on a different journey not aware of the possible consequences. Ennis wants to go on with his life as planned. And he tries so for 20 years and nothing is as planned. At one crucial moment he tells Jack: ""Why don't you let me be? Look at me, I am like this because of you "" but he knows better than that. On the one hand he is trapped in his early childhood memory of two guys beaten to death because of ""that thing."" As he recalls: ""My father made sure my brother and I saw it."" At the same time, he is overwhelmed with this wonderful feeling that he knows is wrong  so why is it so good when he is with him? Drawn to one another, they meet several times a year for ""fishing"" in Brokeback Mountain where they felt free and utterly happy; in spite of their families' doubts and suspicions. Ennis' wife has seen their passion and she does not want to face it. She does not want to admit her marriage has failed. Gradually, she becomes more and more unhappy and gets it off her chest only when remarried to another guy. Jack's wife is simply unhappy. Until the very end, when her suspicions unveil, she does not know the reason why but she does not feel loved.Jack's death is sudden and unexpected for the viewer. Yet, Ennis could picture exactly what happened because he knows his friend only too well. Was it just a reflection of what he saw in the past? Perhaps, but reality is too cruel to escape. His visit to Jack's parents is as touching a scene as it could possibly be. Not many words are spoken but so much is said. Jack's room, the window from which he looked into the world as a kid and the words: ""I promise you Jack ""  it all comes together and Ennis comes to terms with his feelings for the first time and forever.All characters are brilliantly brought to life by a wonderful cast. Jake Gyllenhaal shines with optimism in search for what he thinks is doable. The two supporting roles of Williams and Hathaway are played to perfection. Finally, Heath Ledger's Ennis Del Mar is breathtaking and unforgettable. He manages to convince us in the simple and yet complex nature of his character. The pain in his eyes when he finds out his shirt in Jack's closet is out of this world; that's how good he is.Brokeback Mountain is not just another pathetic ""Love Story"" or as some label it ""a homosexual Gone With the Wind."" Brokeback Mountain is what love is all about. Undoubtedly.P.S. To answer some of the comments here: Everyone watches from their own embedded social prospective. If you lived in San Francisco or Amsterdam and you are gay, sure it will be a step back, if you are in Teheran, it will be outrageously brave. Straight people will also see it differently and mainly be bitter for wasting good money on a ""queer"" movie, so there is no point to expect a common ground. Some will be disappointed because of the lack of Hollywood glamour, some with the lack of ""tender"" love scenes ... However, one thing is certain ... the world is not ready for a normal movie about two people who love each other if they do not fit the social milieu.",Brokeback Mountain
2217,merlynnb,different versions of Brokeback Mountain,10,17 February 2006,"Brokeback Mountain was amazing. I am not going to try to top some of the wonderful reviews here, but I did want to make a comment. I was moved enough by the movie to see it a second time (this never happens) and went to see it at a different theater. I was shocked, though, that it seemed like a different version. And there were definitely differences in the tent scenes between Ennis and Jack. There were other differences, too, but the tent scenes had the most striking differences. I didn't know if this was for a specific reason or not...but it made a difference. So, I certainly recommend seeing this movie, but I can't help but wonder if different people are seeing different versions.",Brokeback Mountain
2218,dzaber,I think doth protesteth to much,9,2 March 2006,"Wow. What a backlash. And all this vehemence for a movie critics seem to find ""boring"" or ""not worth anything"" or ""stupid"" or ""shallow"" or did I mention ""boring""? Most of the vehement writers seem to be too smart by half as they all spin circles trying to avoid the real reason they didn't like the movie. After all, how many truly boring or meaningless or empty movies evoke this degree of reactionary responses? I've seen the films twice and each time found it to be moving and encompassing. I'll admit there are some technical difficulties but those pale in comparison to the acting triumphs peppered throughout the movie's 2+ hours. Boring? Hardly. Determined is more like it.What's really funny to read are the accusations that this is some sort of tool of the ""gay agenda"" whatever the heck that is. Yup, there are lots of gay people in Hollywood and in the arts; its because that was one place that gays were accepted, at least as long as they stayed hidden from the public. There's also lots of gays in Washington D.C., including on the Republican side yet no one is accusing them of having an agenda.Those who don't like gays and don't support equal rights for all people will always be offended by changes in society. Many will realize the errors of their bigotry when their sister or father or son or daughter or cousin or best friend comes out. Yet far too many will continue to utilize the cold and consuming energy of hate to power themselves and their lives; those are the ones who cannot stand to see this movie be successful.Oh, and by the way, I'm not gay. I just thought that Ang Lee put together a movie whose pace was on an entirely different scale than we are used to seeing in mass media. The acting was difficult for many reasons, not the least of which was the need to bridge the scales of time and space that are embodied in the cinematography and story lines. Lee used some interesting mechanisms to foreshadow and connect human behavior with nature's wrath and beauty. Too bad those excellent artistic moments seemed to have been lost on the OWGs (Obsessed with Gays).Oh, and I thought that some of the best parts of the film where the interactions between Ennis and his two daughters. As a father of two, including a wonderful and talented daughter, I was moved by the grasp Mr. Ledger had of the buried emotions that a father would feel in such a situation. When Ennis finally recognizes that his daughter is loved by someone and he reaches for the whiskey, the film reaches a subtle and wonderful point. That was connection and self-reflection and humanity.Too bad the movie was boring and empty and irrelevant pro-gay propaganda that will never make a dime and will be shunned by moral people world-wide. Why? Because perhaps the professional gay-bashers, and liberal-haters and those of their ilk may have gotten something out of it other than mind-numbing boredom.",Brokeback Mountain

America is well-known for its prude attitude towards sexuality in general; therefore a gay-film will be more of a risk in the States than in Europe.I believe this movie is being hijacked by self-proclaimed ""progressive"" and ""intellectual"" people, to demonstrate just how progressive they really are. I am far from anti-gay, I've got close friends which are gay, and I love them very much. It bothers me that this is in essence an average film with a so-so story, and a gay-aspect is now being misused by people to sound politically correct.Yes, the nature shots are beautiful. But the Discovery Channel shows me those images too. Yes, Heath Ledger is a good actor and he plays his part very well. But is this enough to be ""the film of the year""? Not at all.

I had seen the media hype and heard the jokes yet never read the short story it's based upon. What I saw was a movie that had a universal message, a film so powerful that it rips you to bits. The story is terribly sad and bleak and I use the word heartbreak in it's original sense because it does just that: it breaks your heart. Yet its' beauty and simplicity are breathtaking, this film will be ranked as one of the greatest movies ever made. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal deserve their nominations, they are brilliant. The film deserves to win Best Picture, as a matter of fact it deserves to win every award it has been nominated for and THAT is something which can rarely be said of ANY film! There is no downside at all to BBM, Ang Lee has created something which will stand the test of time and become a great classic. It is the only film I have ever seen where the entire audience--men, women, gay, straight, young, old--left the theater with their mouths open, and yes, it's effect IS that powerful. I can't recommend it highly enough; I intend to see it again in the theater and buy the DVD in April. Absolutely fantastic.",Brokeback Mountain
2224,mollynif,"Unfortunately, I really didn't like it...",3,19 February 2006,"I have to say, I was thoroughly disappointed with this film. After so very much hype over it, I expected a sure winner in my book. After all, I love a good love story, to me-and so many will disagree-this was not that. I went into this film with no qualms about the gay themed context, I was just in the mood for a little romance, and the love between two people, gay or straight, can be powerful stuff. I sat ready to be amazed in that first half hour, but instead felt bored. The scene in which Ennis and Jack make love for the first time seemed utterly mechanical and emotionless for me, not to mention abrupt. I do, however realize that the scene was supposed to convey their passion(mixed with a little courage thanks to the whiskey)for one another. I just didn't feel it. In fact, I really didn't feel much of anything from the characters. To me the emotions were flat, lukewarm at best. I get that Jack and Ennis have to repress their feelings, and so it's not going to come of as some prideful expression, but it seemed like the chemistry was lacking. Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway are two very talented young actors(as are Heath Ledger and Jake Gylenhall)but again, I felt their performances were muted, although Williams conveyed a lot of hurt and sadness, especially through her eyes and facial expressions. Linda Cardellini was quite good as Cassie, a young woman who loves Ennis, and is so confused and hurt that he's not returning the feelings. Kate Mara as Alma Jr at age 19, was also very believable, worried about her father, wanting his love and affection, but unable to really help him. The movie felt too jumpy for me. Example:At the river after Jack has found his blue parka, he and Ennis sit in the dark. Jack says ""Sometimes I miss you so much"" or close to that, and then the scene's over, they're lying in the tent together. I know there was supposed to be power in that scene, a dignified expression of the love shared, but it left me wanting more-and not really in a good way. I felt as though so many scenes were left unfinished, left to rely on the underlying meaning and become powerful, which to me they didn't. I know a lot of people think this movie is the cat's pajama's, and that's great, I'm not trying to trash the movie, but I can't say I cared for it and know a few people who have said it was amazing only to later admit after further discussion that they didn't like it, but felt compelled to like it. It's gotta be good though, it's up for quite a few awards and has gotten rave reviews, but I just can't jump on that band wagon. I know what the movie and the actors wanted to convey, I just didn't feel it.",Brokeback Mountain

2226,tsakiroglou_2005,"Simply Suberp ""BRAVO MAESTRO""",10,20 February 2006,"What an wonderful drama. Tremendous performances. This movie shows how love doesn't know anything about genders. Two starts have been born: Heath Ledger & Jake Gyllenhaal. It's impossible not to feel touched by this awesome film. God bless Ang Lee, the only one able to do history... Oscars won't be enough to recognize the incredible value on this gem. Gyllenhaal adds the perfect element to make Jack Twist credible, Gyllenhaal makes an outstanding performance. Heath Ledger, well what can I say?, there are no words to qualify his job. Surely, Brokeback Mountain has proved how love become into an addiction. After you watch it, all the movie cross over your mind during all days 'cause it has been showed to us a different kind of reality which has never been assumed by film industry because of silly fears. This is not about queers or sexual behaviors, it shows the pain of two simply mens who seem to have lived in the wrong period. Brokeback made the difference, all stupid clichés have been ignored by the director. When Jack dies we feel a sort of sadness and it proves the great quality of the director. BRAVO MAESTRO",Brokeback Mountain
2227,rakesh-roy,A really wonderful and touching experience,10,20 February 2006,"It is a remarkable film - something not seen before. The way it handled such a sensitive subject will appeal to all types of audiences. The direction of Ang Lee was great - the story of a lifetime was compressed in a 2 hour movie and the pace was remarkable. The acting was really good and the main protagonists brought out the characters, as if they were real. The actors moved to the background and the screen characters took the center stage. The underlying pain that lingered throughout the movie was touchy and the ending should really touch all. This movie should do really good at the Oscars ..... a perfect 10 from me. I would recommend lovers of thoughtful and serious movies to see this one .. they should not miss it for anything.",Brokeback Mountain
2228,timothy_thicknesse,A true Love Story,9,20 February 2006,"I have for the first time seen a true love story! There were no cheesy hit up lines, no slap stick humour, just pure love. That this movie has been laughed at, condemned by churches, and conservatives is a disgrace.A story about two people falling in love should not be left out in the cold so to speak, it should be embraced.The acting is first rate, the directing is brilliant and the script is five star and the location just like Jack and Enis's love is pure beauty! The emotional ending left tears in my eyes, I could see the pain in Heath Ledgers eyes at what could have been but never was.All in all, everyone associated with this movie need an award, in particual Jake and Heath, they were willing to go some place that others feared.",Brokeback Mountain
2229,brock_zz,Powerful and Troubling at the Same Time,9,20 February 2006,"I saw this movie recently and I left the theater unsure as to what I really felt about the movie. I think this is because the film has strengths in a variety of areas, but also is troubling in some sense. On the one hand it has great scenery and setting. It has very good acting, and although the acting is great it is not what I think really makes the film stand out. I think what makes this film is the underlying story and the work of the director. The story, while not complex (as expected from a short story) is very powerful. The imagery of the film really got me as well. Some of the scenes while brief really rivet you as you sit in the audience. These include what Alma sees when she looks out the window, the roadside scene retold at the end of the movie, and the scene near the end visiting Jack's parents.To be honest, the film is very stark and is somewhat disturbing. It has bothered me for these four days since I saw it. It makes one think about the constraints society places on all of us, but also the constraints we put on ourselves. Society can be very cruel to us in the end and the film shows this very strongly. While I found this film to be very riveting, even more so after leaving the theater, I almost wish I had not seen it in some ways. It is troubling and painful to me for some reason. That being said, I would recommend it to others primarily because I feel it is worth experiencing for all of the good and also the negative reasons. I wanted to post about this film as it is very strong, but I think I'd have a better summarization if I had waited a month or two....",Brokeback Mountain
2230,margijtjentajh,Heartbreakingly awesome,10,28 March 2006,"This movie really touched me. Right after I had seen it I thought ""Oh,that's sad"" but as time went and I thought about it more, and after a couple of hours I was so heartbroken, I cried. I knew that I would have to see it again. So I did, one week later. All that week I couldn't get my mind off it, and in my English class the day after I had seen it, I almost started crying because we were listening to a tape with Texan American speech. When I saw it the second time, I cried. A lot. And I still thought about it a lot. I wanted to find out what especially I liked about this amazing movie, so I sat down and thought about it, and came up with a list:-It tells an amazing story, heartbreaking and beautiful.-Ledger and Gyllenhaal plays incredibly well. Ledger plays his part so unbelievably great. You can see how difficult it is for Ennis to deal with the relationship with Jack and how scared he is of someone finding out about it, but also how much he needs and loves him. Gyllenhaal plays just as well as Ledger. He knows what he wants, but not how to tell Ennis this. He is very afraid to lose him or to scare him away. You really see that Jack loves Ennis, how affective and caring he is.-The filming is truly beautiful. When you have seen this movie, you remember the scenes down to the tiniest detail. Every shot is like a painting, a beautiful painting.-The landscape is awesome. The mountains, the sheep, the sky, everything.-It's realistic. You truly believe that this is a true story. I felt so sorry for all the Ennises and Jacks in the entire world. -The acting between the characters is amazing. If you want to see chemistry, then here you are.-It's not a cliché-movie. No clichés. I don't feel awkward at any time while watching this. It is just amazing. Funny, clever, sad, violent, natural.",Brokeback Mountain
2231,malcomd,They created characters and brought them to life,10,21 February 2006,"I remember watching the dire ""Mission Impossible 2"" where the heroine was trying to decide whether or not to kill herself and just wishing she'd get on with it. Nothing could be more different from ""Brokeback"" where between the writers, the director and the actors they have created characters so real you seem to know them as friends.Of course it's a tragedy, but rather like a massage in a Turkish bath (in Turkey) the film hurts but makes you feel a lot better.Only one weakness, and it's the credibility of the plot. What gay man (or straight woman -or straight man come to think of it) in his/her right mind would keep Jake Gyllenhaal waiting for twenty years then say ""see you in November""?",Brokeback Mountain
2232,jcmigz,Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal should win the Oscars,10,21 February 2006,"I have seen the movies of the three front runners in the male actor category, and I'm writing to convince you that Heath Ledger is hands down the winner. Ditto for Jake Gyllenhaal for his almost flawless supporting performance. While Heath's roles in past movies are forgettable, his performance in BBM is without question the most convincing I have seen in a very long time. This compliment comes from someone who has had quite a similar past. I have come to see Brokeback several times during the last 8 weeks or so, and every time I see it, I cannot help but be mesmerized not only by Ledger's magnificent performance but also by Gyllenhaal's quiet but very strong performance of a person hurting. While Phillip Hoffman's role is challenging in Capote, there is a certain degree of similarity in characters he has portrayed in the past, such as his role as a calculating friend to Jude Law in The Talented Mr. Ripley. His role in Capote is somewhat diminished by the commonality of the eccentric characters he has portrayed in past films such as Boogie Nights. As for Joaquin Phoenix, he too was convincing as Johnny Cash in Walk The Line, but depicting a singer's drug addiction and marriage struggles is not exactly the kind of role that would define Joaquin's acting prowess. I thought his role as the tormented Cash was too easy for him. Joaquin already has a dark side of him that shows in every role he has taken. Remember Gladiator? Heath and Jake, on the other hand, showed us a 360 degree turn in their acting proficiency. Their ability to transcend from past mediocre roles to a realistic portrayal of a gay man in denial is no easy accomplishment for someone who is apparently straight. And to be able to convince the audience that being gay doesn't necessarily mean being effeminate just like the Ennis del mar and the Jack Twist they so gracefully portrayed on the screen is already an acting miracle. The longing in their eyes, the brief but very engaging dialog spoken in rare but genuine affection makes someone who's had a similar past shiver in painful recollection of the many episodes of his difficult survival. No other film in recent memory has captured the very essence of a closeted man's miserable existence. I wonder why the Academy has for so long denied an Oscar for male acting to someone who's really good-looking? Could it be that looks and talent rarely go together? Despite Heath's immature and almost stupid demeanor during the SAG awards, I still wouldn't deny him the credit he so very much deserves in Brokeback. Jake also very much so deserves the supporting actor honors. Without Jake's engaging voice and tender looks, Heath's character would not have stood out. They were perfect for each other, if only for the movie. A loss for any of these men would be like ditching the movie. Brokeback has a great love story of almost legendary importance. I dare you to see the movie again and tell me that I am wrong. But if you agree with my comments here, kindly please forward it to your friends in high places so that justice will be served come Oscar night. Thanks for your time.",Brokeback Mountain
2233,slavena_z,I totally liked it.,10,22 July 2007,"I think the movie is really great and one of a kind. I think it should be watched without prejudices and without preliminary opinions so that it could be appreciated for what it is. This film is in my personal top ten of the most touching movies. Moreover, it is also one of my favourite love stories. Yes, to some this may sound odd (if they have seen the movie or heard of it) but that is what it is. I don't want to argue about homosexuality, I don't think that is so important. I think the characters are not just two men, they are two human beings. Therefore, their sexual orientation is just a minor detail. Yes, it matters but not that much. It matters to the rest of the world and that is the problem. Once again, for me it is one of the best and most profound movies I've seen.",Brokeback Mountain
2234,gerrymorales,On Brokeback Mountain,10,21 April 2006,"I remember when this movie was in the works, there was tremendous buzz about it. An Oscar Winning Director with Mainstream leads in a story about two men in love in 1960's Wyoming. Unfortunately, by the time it got to theaters, the simple yet effective premise was horribly overshadowed by nudge, nudge jokes about ""gay cowboys"" and men having sex with each other in a tent. This movie had the potential to change the hearts and minds of Americans both straight AND gay (since gay people nowadays are too excited about the minstrel spectacle of gay men doing gay things in front of gay people on gay television) on how gay men lived and still live their lives.The truth is that Brokeback Mountain and the story itself of two men feeling something they cant fully understand and left to their own devices to figure their emotions out, could take place in 1963 or 2003. It is an accurate (although not pretty) portrayal of how gay men live their lives with one another as they interpret love and fidelity on both theirs and another man's terms. It is a subject that deserved a great deal more respect than it got and it was a subject that certainly needed more attention than the old story of how sad and pathetic people in L.A's lives are that they need to crash into one another to feel something. Los Angeles has shoved it's disgusting pathology into people's throats since 1991.Yes its tragic that blacks and whites don't get along in Los Angeles and that cops are corrupt and racist and hate their job and are bitter about anything and everyone around them. I hate to break it to you, but I learned that lesson years ago from Ice-T. By the way, it's ironic that ""Crash"" needed a pretty white girl to sing a song about how black people and white people don't get along in LA...or maybe not ironic, just bad casting.It should be sufficient to note that ""Brokeback Mountain"" opened doors for more movies to come that accurately portray the culture of homosexuality in America. But for me it's not. When you have the chance to knock a movie like this out of the ballpark and truly impact our society as this movie had, a pat on the back isn't exactly what you want when it doesn't happen.",Brokeback Mountain
2235,user-2595,A Perfect Insight into human character and emotional struggle,10,23 February 2006,"A masterpiece of situation and emotional analysis. Seeing the movie takes you back to the emotional uproar of your own emotions, makes you remember what you went through in a similar situation. A dive into melancholy and nostalgia supported by the perfect scenery and great soundtrack. The performances of Ledger and Gyllenhaal are unprecedented: Very natural and very pragmatic. Ledger's emotional struggle between own desire and what society imposes is a landmark and a milestone of performance. Gyllenhaal's character on other side gives another side of the coin. Ledger is the scared person who does not dare to accept his reality and Gyllenhaal is the revolutionary, ready to give everything up for what he believes, for what he feels. A presentation of human values long forgotten. A milestone in the cinematic history of homosexual love. A must see.",Brokeback Mountain
2236,aiden38,BBM forever,10,6 March 2006,"Ignore the Academy snub - BBM you will be loved. Hollywood didn't have the gumption to take on a film as honest as you. One should have seen it coming but the shock was visceral all the same when 'Crash' was declared the winner. I don't mean to disparage Crash but a film like BBM comes along once in a lifetime, and every year produces yet another ensemble movie where everyone gets to do a cameo. BBM enters your head and your bloodstream in the way only a great film can. It is a film whose time has come, but it requires an open mind, a warm heart and emotional maturity to appreciate it. It's power to move you has been recognized and rewarded by critics and audiences everywhere, so what does that tell you about the Academy? Still fearful of the ideologues who judge films by their right-wing moral agendas rather than on merit. The choice of Crash with its gritty social themes was a fig leaf by a profession that likes to proclaim easy liberal credentials for itself. So sorry Ang and Heath and Jake and Michelle and Anne, you deserved better from your peers, but thanks for giving us a haunting and unforgettable experience. Tinseltown has shown its true conservative colours and shallowness - you gave it a chance to grow up and it blew it.",Brokeback Mountain
2237,timbeech,Overrated,1,23 February 2006,"I'm in a tiny minority, but I was so disappointed with Brokeback Mountain. I suspect in a few years time people will wonder why it won so many awards - maybe it was just a movie of its time. There is no empathy with the central characters, the falling in love is sudden and brutal, and the pacing throughout was incredibly ponderous. And, for a poor Englishman, trying to understand the muttering dialogue was a real challenge. It was completely cold throughout - none of the characters mattered, nor did their fate stir the slightest emotion. One scene slipped into the next, endlessly, as the movie meandered its way towards a finish. And, boy, did it meander! It seemed to take forever. This movie felt every second of its 2 hours and 15 minutes. Avoid.",Brokeback Mountain
2238,gregt_howell,Was it really worth all the fuss?,5,25 February 2006,"My greivance's with the movie were not many, however, the fact that so much fuss was made over this film really didn't do it any favors. First of all I thought it was a mediocre film. Solid rental. That is of course if you can stand Ang Lee movies, which involve WAY too many wide angle shots of people staring at each other with no dialog (see: 'The Hulk', and 'Sense & Sensibility').My biggest grief with this film is the way it was advertised. Another complaint is with the tag line: Love is a force of nature. No argument here, but with all the infidelity in this movie I can't help but wonder what message this film is really trying to send. To me it's a film more against the institution of marriage than it is about two men in love.Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) first meet each other in the early summer of 1963 in a town called Riverton, Wyoming. They get work as sheppard's for a man (played by Randy Quaid) on Brokeback Mountain. There is obviously an interest these two men have in one another, but the first part of this movie is somewhat troubling. They have sex with each other, but it was more like a prison thing than anything else. These two guys had been stuck up on this mountain for three months with only the company of each other. The sex scene was anything but romantic, and the two have this conversation afterward's which they agree that they're both ""...not queer"".Summer ends, Ennis gets married, and Jack gets work as a rodeo bull rider. Ennis and his new wife stay in Wyoming, and Jack ends up in Texas where he marries Laureen (Anne Hathaway). Cut to 1967 and Ennis gets a postcard from Jack. Jack drives up to Wyoming to see Ennis and when they see each other (for the first time in four years) they embrace and kiss, but again, in my mind it seems forced. Anyway, Ennis' wife sees it from the door of their apartment but says nothing. Under the guise of going fishing for the weekend Jack and Ennis go back up to Brokeback Mountain to be together for a few days. They continue to do this a few weekends out of the year over the next 20 years.Here is where my main problem with the film comes in. Both men are cheating on their wives. Not only is Ennis cheating on his wife but he's taking to treating her like dirt. Many times it looked as though he was going to hit her. He also pays little attention to his daughters and the two eventually get divorced. Jack on the other hand is not quite at odds with his wife, but more with her father. Jack comes from poor stock, and his wife is the daughter of a man who sells heavy duty farm equipment. Adding a class dilemma that Hollywood seems to like to do. Jack is shown to be a pretty good dad, but he tells Ennis that his marriage ""could be done over the phone"". So we have two failed marriages and an affair in between. I realize that this is not uncommon in America, but should it be looked upon as something acceptable? If you're unhappy in a marriage then get out! Get divorced, why would you go through the ritual and then cheat? But get this, not ONLY is Jack cheating on his wife with Ennis, he's cheating on Ennis with another man! There is also another scene that bothered me. After Ennis gets divorced, Jack comes up to see him. But Ennis can't get away because he has the kids that week. So Jack drives all the way back to Texas but doesn't stop there. He goes to Mexico and sees a male prostitute. You see, this is why I'm protesting the tag line: Love is a force of nature. It should read ""Lust is an adversary of the weak-willed"".I feel now I should make a disclaimer. If you're reading this, and you're gay, I don't care. Given the marriage statistic, and the fact that many people lose half of their stuff in divorce litigation, I'm not quite sure why gay people really want to get married. HOWEVER, I believe they should have the right to do so if they wish. But if you're going to do it,stick with it! And if you're not ready to put in the effort, don't commit. Gay or straight, if you enter into a relationship, make the effort to be faithful to one another. It's really no wonder we have all these drugs to treat depression, with the amount of people being betrayed by lovers, girlfriends, boyfriends, husbands, wives, whatever; should we really be surprised that nobody trusts each other anymore? I think this movie was over-rated. But if you read all the reviews on IMDb, almost everyone is sucking up to this film. Honestly I think they're doing it because it's the politically correct thing to do. ""Look at me, I can't be a gay basher because I loved Brokeback Mountain!!!"" Don't get me wrong, I'm sure there are plenty of people who genuinely loved this film. I'm not one of them. I say, mediocre film, unworthy of the hype and the controversy surrounding it. Can't we just get over the whole gay thing? Bottom Line, I give this movie a 5 out of 10.",Brokeback Mountain
2239,elaine-pridham,A love story for this century.,10,24 February 2006,"This film has to be(in my opinion) in contention with Romeo and Juliette as the most beautiful and heart-rending love story ever told, it takes you through every emotion from the first thrill of love through sorrow, jealousy and anger and leaves a lasting impression on your heart and mind. It makes you realise that when you are lucky enough to find the kind of love Ennis and Jack do then you should grab it with both hands. The whole film is beautiful to watch and the acting is superb, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhall are both amazing and capture the spirit of the characters perfectly.

2248,eclectist,Disappointing,1,28 February 2006,"O.k., so sue me. I succumbed to the endless onslaught of reviewers who claim this is a great film. So I went to see it.I should have known I wouldn't like it because I NEVER like the movies that all the critics rave about. Why is that? Why do critics like movies that suck? Perhaps they feel that they need to get people to see movies that they think bring up Important issues. That is, issues that the critics deem as Important, i.e. gay cowboys.Anywho, the movie sucked.First off, I think the two actors who played the gay cowboys took their roles a bit too seriously, because it appeared and sounded like they had big wads of chew in their mouths throughout the entire movie, and I could not understand about 90 percent of their dialogue. Perhaps I would have enjoyed the movie a bit more had I been able to understand it. Who knows? O.k., now about that scene. You know the scene everyone is talking about? As far as sex scenes go, it stunk. I mean, OUCH! Ever heard of lubrication people? Supposedly, we're to think these two guys never participated in this particular type of intimacy so I mean, come on, that's gotta hurt. There was not even any foreplay. Just wham bam thank you. ..sir. Sheesh.All in all, the movie just stank. The dialogue, the acting, the story line. It all stank. There was no one in the movie that you could root for. The two main characters were despicable human beings who ruined not only their own lives, but also the lives of everyone around them, i.e. their wives and children. Not to mention two hours of my life. They were just as likely to punch each other as kiss each other.Part of the problem is that I don't like depressing movies. Or depressing books. Why is it that the critics always root for the depressing stuff? It appears that critics believe books and movies have to be depressing in order to be worthy of praise. Not me. I like movies and books that celebrate the triumph of the human spirit. Adversity is o.k. as long as our hero or heroin learns how to triumph in spite of it. How is it entertaining to watch people's lives that are as depressing or even more depressing than yours? No thank you very much.In short, don't see this movie, unless you like movies that suck.Oh wait, one more comment, this is like the gay version of Same Time Next Year. I didn't like that movie either.O.k. had to add this comment here. I forgot to mention about the previews. There was this really long preview for what appeared to be gay pornography... basically a really long commercial advertisement for a video you can buy (i think) called gay sex in the 70's. So, it appears that if you want to see an ""award-winning"" movie that just so happens to have gay characters in it, you are subjected to gay porn advertising. Gross. I don't want to see straight or gay pornographic advertising thank you very much. I just like going to see good movies. I think it was highly inappropriate to advertise that during the previews for the film.And for the record, this review was not written in order to insult the homosexual lifestyle. I have several friends who are homosexual and they are lovely people. This movie is not about them. This was a horrible movie with horrible acting, and a horrible story about horrible people.I decided to post this review on here because yahoo deleted it the day after i posted it. Apparently they are deleting negative reviews, and many people keep reposting their reviews because of that. I was appalled to realize those people were not in fact paranoid, because it happened to me too. So I am ceasing to use yahoo movies, and have decided to jump on the IMDb band wagon. Hopefully things are done more fairly around here so that ratings of movies are more balanced and not skewed in favor of good reviews.",Brokeback Mountain
2249,joniano,Brokeback Mountain is only a novelty,4,1 March 2006,"I must say, being a gay male in my middle 30's, wanting to see this movie was such a highlight; however, I suffered such disappointment. The film (as did the book) did not fully help the viewer understand the characters. I was completely lost during the first sexual encounter. It set gays back a hundred years. Dismissing that as a lustful event, I waited to see if things got better. The characters were transparent and I wanted them to relate better toward each other. There weren't any romantic moments other than when they were in the hotel room. I felt as though I missed a huge chunk of ""something."" I wanted the story to develop more. The ending, though it tried, taxied on the runway for what seemed like hours. Yeah, Jack kept Ennis' shirt. It could have been impacted more by a flashback scene or dialogue of what Ennis was thinking in his head. Instead, we saw the shirt. I still want to like this movie since it is the only current representation of gays that everyone is talking about, but I also feel that if this movie wins Best Picture then it will feel safe to say that Hollywood is blind.",Brokeback Mountain
2250,cwedge,A daring and courageous story that speaks to the heart,9,1 March 2006,"A really quite remarkable and moving love story between 2 cowboys that transcends any notions of what love between 2 people 'should' be. From their first raw encounter of physical intimacy, to the warmth and compassion that follows, we are taken on a journey of love and despair as these 2 men endeavour to keep alive an impossible relationship in the most difficult and unforgiving of times.Full of passion, daring, hope and despair, Heath & Jake give extremely brave and heartfelt performances in roles that not only would be a formidable challenge for any straight actor, but that will also shake and perhaps change forever the traditional stereo-type of the American cowboy. The courage required to bring this 'forbidden' love story to life on the screen is almost breathtaking, and is fully deserving of any awards that come its' way",Brokeback Mountain
2251,fonzarellaarthur,waste of time and money,1,2 March 2006,"This film was boring, maybe because i could not identify myself with the characters. this should not be a problem if the story would be interesting. It was not. Also the scenes were not picturesque enough to keep my attention.Can't figure out what the fuss was all about, or maybe because in Europe we are used to gays more then the us , I don't know.My friend and I but jumped to the same conclusion! To sweet. Hardly any character development which could stimulate and trickle your attention. Also the other characters were not well developed. Except the wife of the elder cowboy(never remember the names, i'm sorry)There is also no mystery or other cliffhangers which could take your attention.And I do like good films, but this was really not my cup of to sweet tea.!!!!!!!!!!",Brokeback Mountain
2252,seba74,"Not a masterpiece, but I still can't believe what it has done to me",10,5 March 2006,"I was of course moved by some scenes while watching the movie, but it's only a few hours later that I felt this irrepressible need for crying, that « retro-active » emotional bang a lot of people have described. Never thought this would happen to me.It's seems that, when a movie has a « gay component », it has to be a journalistic documentary. But this is not the « National Geographic », it is not a study on how those strange creatures called homosexuals live ;-). The characters are fictional. These movie is not based on a true story, but on simple human, and oh so common, feelings.Still, some things are not credible, mainly some aspects of the relationship between Ennis and Jack, sometimes I felt that there are two heterosexual actors doing their best to play gay or bi-sexual characters. I guess it's because, even for talented actors, there are not much good cinematic examples of what an emotional relationship between two men can beI also find that the make-up is sometimes a problem, and it is not easy to « feel » the characters aging.Unlike many people, I found the movie too short. The twenty years between they met and Jack's death seem to be twenty months. I wanted to know more about them, their wives, their kidsAbout the « tent scene » : at first, I didn't like it  two men having a brutal, fast and raw sexual encounter- this is not good for the already bad enough image of how gay people behave. But, at second thought, why not ? This could happen. A genuine relationship between two people can begin with only sex, and then become something different. Those guys are young, probably knowing nothing about love and desire, and not able to manage it, and they are drunk, so they do what they can, even if it's in a rough and very « basically hormonal » way. One more « romantic » approach I touch your shoulder, then your hand, then I kiss you- would have been worse. Without going into details, that sex scene is not totally credible. I guess this is done on purpose, cause this is not necessary for the story. Everybody understand what they are doing, don't need a schematic. Frankly, when you see a cinematic sex scene between a woman and a man, do you think it is close to reality ?Some didn't like the attitude of the two main characters  Well neither did I : they are emotionally immature, they lie to each other, to their wives. They lack so many marks that they can't solve their problems, and even if they knew how to, would the society let them do ? Somebody wrote that, if they had been more courageous, they could have moved to another place well what other place can you find in the 60's (and even now) where you can be, if not accepted, but at least tolerated when you are a gay couple? Probably in a big city, without the mountains, the wild nature you've always lived in. It would have been another kind of death. They should be free to live together in the country they were born and raised in. Social pressure can be a tombstone, and homophobia surely is, even for the people involved in the making of this movie. Let me explain :both Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger had to repeat that they are not homosexuals. Why do they feel obliged to ? Think about thatA good point is that the gay characters are portrayed as « normal » people, not « queens », or so cultivated artists from the jet set. They are not rich (which is very important in the story, especially for Ennis). They are average people trying to live their life in a harsh world.Somebody wrote that the only mainstream successful movies talking about gay characters are tragedies (they suffer and they die) or silly comedies (« Birdcage » and co.) Well, that's sadly true. The difference here is that you can relate to the characters, because they are not from another galaxy, they are just people with problems beyond them.Some people say this is not really a gay love story, but a love story that could happen between a woman and a man. Maybe I'm wrong, but I think that's a -probably unconscious- way to erase the main topic of the story. This is loving, sexual, passionate, call it the way you want, relationship between two men, with no clues on how to deal with it. A heterosexual relationship would have been different, maybe as tragic as this one, but different. But I agree with the fact that this movie is so much more than a « gay story » and surely not a « gay western » (it feels like this reducing definition has been created by some to destroy the movie even before it was released).I saw Brokeback six days ago and I am beginning to slowly « get out » of it. The twenty or so last minutes, and particularly the final « Jack, I swear » still echo in my memory. Incredible how those simple words can produce such a painful emotion. Probably it is that profound loneliness and all those regrets Ennis is left with, and all he understands then, what could have been IF ... Brobeback is not the best movie of all time, but, despite it left me with a lump in my throat for days, it reminded me what is really important in life. Since I've seen it, I can't stop holding in my arms the one I'm so lucky to love and live with.That's why this movie is more than just another good movie : it gives something that stays with you and may change you.",Brokeback Mountain

I was feeling the same sadness that Ennis was going thru. I felt in love with Jack as deep as Ennis felt... and then left the movie with a complete sadness. I went back and I saw it again... then I learned new things...it is true, is nature's call...so powerful. It is a movie that makes you come back to see it again. I wish they would release the DVD's with subtitles in Spanish. It is only being shown in English with no subtitles. I have been thru the same experience in my life and very well understand the things we have to hide and the lies we have to tell to keep dear ones and friends happy toward me.

So imagine my surprise when my wife comes home with two tickets to go see Brokeback Mountain (She heard about its 8 Oscar nominations or something). Now, you don't know my wife..but she asks me to do about two things a year: go to a dinner with her and go to movie. And if I don't, I'm pretty sure I would lose an appendage and since I didn't really want to figure which one she'd pick, I just went and saw it. And I liked it. It got me thinking...what if I'm wrong? about the whole thing. I'm not saying I'm gonna agree with the whole gay agenda or anything...but it got me thinking.

Ennis was me. Still, he has brought me back a reflection of myself I had well forgotten.Before June 1999 I had never been kissed. I had never been touched. I was so lonely, so lost. I remember I was not able to make a move to save my life. Now, watching this movie, he (Ennis) brought it all back to me. It deals with the very human drama of not taking proper advantage of the opportunities we are offered here and now. It's real. There are people like him, in this situation. Gay and straight.Sadly, we actually have nothing but a now here on Earth. These opportunities may not be there tomorrow. And when it domes to who we really are, I think it's such a waste to beat around the bush for so long.There's much more about the movie that could be said here but I want to leave something untouched for you people out there.",Brokeback Mountain

To say that this is probably the best movie I have seen is not an exaggeration. Ennis and Jack were totally believable, I cannot even call them characters, they were to real. I sat there and watched their lives unfold and wanted to call out to them to stop the madness they were living. I only wish that the moral majority in the U.S. would see this movie and actually see it for the love story that it is, and that who we love is not a choice.

Homosexuality is not something that one chooses in there life, you are either Gay or Straight, black or white, fat or skinny, and on and on. I think as time goes on we will all be more exposed to homosexuality and learn to understand it more and hopefully except it for those who have chosen that life style.Homosexuality has been around forever and we all need to understand that.Whatever a person chooses to become is there own business. It is no good for a man to marry a woman just because we can not accept his or her homosexuality. I myself have Married a woman knowing good and damn well I was Gay. I need to just be myself and be accepted for who I am. Gay people are here and we all need to get over it.

The ending is far too familiar in movies with gay relationships. Growing up it was all the movies dealing with HIV, then it was the gay drug scene and now this. If you've seen movies with gay relationships, that never made it to the big screen, this will be the same with great cinematography. The movie will give a first glance to those who don't have gay friends or family members. To those who are struggling with their own identity, in a small town, go see this movie! Though it never has a climax or much of a plot, it is a good overall story. I grew up in a big city and never really went ""in the closet"" so it was interesting to see what it would be like. It just went on and on and on. Made it hard to keep myself interested. The nudity is no worse than a daytime soap opera, it's just two men. The only real nudity you will see has nothing to do with sex. Over all, IT'S ABOUT TIME and I hope the next movie about a gay relationship will be more mainstream.",Brokeback Mountain

It is a very complicated love story and very beautiful to see. I do not want to say too much you must see it with your own eyes. I am thanking Ang Lee and all actors in this film and also to the people who make the story. It is great thing to bring Brokeback Mountain to cinema. I am sorry this wonderful film does not win Oscar that is stupid mistake by Hollywood. As I say this is special film you will understand me when you see it.

2265,mankoffcoach,Superb but Misunderstood Film,10,8 March 2006,"A great film, but one that is typically mislabeled as being about closeted homosexuals. It would be more accurate to say the two male characters are bisexuals in terms of their sexual orientation. But what is most significant is that after a while they lose interest in labels altogether and perhaps we would all be better off if we did the same because such labels can prevent people from responding naturally to unexpected and anomalous but ultimately rewarding encounters with our fellow humans. Some, but not all, people might recognize that they could be attracted to at least one member of a gender that they could not imagine was possible having any desire for.

And at every viewing the story takes on a stronger and deeper meaning. I am trying to draw some comparison to films I've experienced previously, but there are none to compare. Brokeback Mountain is in a class by itself. This movie is presented in a simple way, but the story is complex and the depth the filmmakers went to create an accurate adaptation of the short story is astonishing. The acting by the four leads (Heath, Jake, Michelle, and Anne) is unprecedented and these artists are sure to have set a new standard in performance.

Ang Lee masterfully expressed the tension of the situation and extremely difficult scenes, such as the initial somewhat violent sex scene, with such taste, that at no point was it difficult to watch.If you want to watch a film about forbidden love, and the lengths that homosexuals had to go to in the past (and possibly to some degree in the present) then watch this film.

2272,dilfiman,Brokeback Mountain disappointment,4,10 March 2006,"I believed all the hype and praise lavished on this film by the critics and some members of the public. I went to see the film as part of a birthday treat. I was hugely disappointed. First of all, because of declining audiences the film had been relegated to a smaller screen cinema and although there were many women in the audience there were only 4 men in the whole audience - and they were accompanied by females.For the first time in many years I kept looking at my watch to see when the film would end - it really was that slow paced and boring. I believe the film is over-long, over-hyped and under acted. The content of the film does not bother me - otherwise I wouldn't have gone to see it - it simply is not a very good film. As a love story it seriously under impresses - and that has nothing to do with the fact that two men are the subject of the story. The two leading male roles miss the mark of being believable and the role of family life with the wives and children is very badly portrayed and under played. Ang Lee has missed a great opportunity here to develop the female characters as their part in the film and their contribution to the storyline is seriously at fault. The leading female roles are simply not believable yet with a running time of over 2 hours the opportunity was there to improve the credibility of the film. This film was based on a short story - and it does not work as a long film. It would make a good TV movie with an hour taken off the running time. Although it was nominated, it did not deserve to win Best Picture award and the judges votes correctly reflected that in my opinion. Some people love the film and I am pleased for them. I did not and it really is as simple as that.",Brokeback Mountain
2273,terrium,"A lot more than a ""Gay Cowboy Movie""",7,10 March 2006,"The hype about this movie is very misdirected. It got spread by word of mouth with the description ""that gay cowboy movie"". This movie is not just about gay cowboys. Yes, it contains the love of two men, but it doesn't get mushy or try to push a message of homosexual acceptance. A large conflict in the movie is, in fact, about the internal struggles regarding the choice of homosexuality/heterosexuality. It also displays the conflict with society regarding these decisions, but there is tons of other stuff going on here. Cheating, disassociation with children, a glimpse of rich/snob high society, the fun of camping out, etc.Personally, my favorite thing about this movie was the beautiful scene-scapes, the camping, horseback riding, drinking whiskey about a campfire, dancing, wonderful entertainment if you ask me.*Spoilers below* I think they downplayed the death of Jack way too much. I felt there was no time to consider his death, and the scene with Jack's parents was very spooky/serious and not sad whatsoever. There wasn't even music during the phone call with Jack's wife, and Ennis didn't even cry. The final scene with the shirt still in the closet was amazing though.",Brokeback Mountain

2275,Tomokazu,No need of any awards,10,14 March 2006,"This is the first time I've felt compelled to write something after seeing a movie, and it feels strange to do it, to say the least. But after Brokeback Mountain has got me for one week and 3 viewings, I desperately needed to find some kind of catharsis to all these feelings still burning inside. That's how I ended up here on IMDb reading all the postings and finding to my big surprise that everybody feels the same! Man or woman... straight or gay... old or young... Everybody. And everywhere around the world! I wonder what it is with this movie that sticks to your soul and makes you feel so sad, yet so hopeful after viewing...The story about the love between two men is not precisely what you can call universally appealing. Even more, they happen to be cheating on their wives and passing their own children's needs on behalf of their own. So, where does the instant empathy with Ennis and Jack comes from? I think it might be the fact that everybody has his/her share of mistakes, wrong choices, regrets and 'what ifs' to fight internally with that makes it so easy to understand them and the way they so hardly try to come to terms with their own desires. Because Brokeback Mountain is not just a gay love story. It transcends any attempt on labeling to become a human story about unrealized happiness and regrets of wrong choices.I know almost everybody has said it already, but Heath Ledger's pitch perfect portrayal of Ennis and Jake Gyllenhaal's nuanced Jack Twist are the main reason why this film worked so incredibly well. Not trying to undertone Ang Lee's heartfelt direction, McMurtry and Ossana's intelligent adaptation, the rest of the supporting cast or the staff, but let's face it... is anybody out there able to say he/she didn't want to jump inside the screen and give both of them a big hug and protect them from the rest of the world? A lot of people think this was Ledger's film, but I think he wouldn't have been as perfect without the other half... would he? I positively think that such a perfect chemistry between the leads has rarely been seen before. Forget about Taylor/Burton, Bacall/Bogart, Rogers/Astaire. And I even dare to bet not even star-crossed lovers like Romeo & Juliet, or Heathcliff & Cathy had ever had the kind of rave support for their love to become real as Ennis & Jake have. If this isn't becoming part of history then I don't know how to name it. Ennis and Jack. They will be forever united in eternity because they shared (even in small ways), they cared for each other, they loved...And to think of it, maybe the secret of healing with this hard to understand feeling you're left with after viewing, is precisely to share with others your most feared dreams, your inner feelings, your lost love stories. Like we're all doing. I hope tonight I am able to sleep...It's natural to wish our favorite films and stars to receive plenty awards to reassure them as THE Best, but who needs an Oscar when so many people around the world express their love in so many ways? They're both very young, so I'm sure they will have their great awards moment in a very near future.To all the people involved in this film, thank you for having the guts to have it made! No need of any unreceived awards, it's perfect as it is. You've just given us all a big lesson on love and understanding.",Brokeback Mountain

Ang Lee is amazing as always! I love the fact that this movie moved me out of my comfort zone and forced me to look at the heart of these two men. I learned to love them both and feel the pain of Alma and her children. I laughed more than I have in a long time and I have to say that I also cried more than I have in a long time.I'll buy it the minute it comes out on DVD. I have been waiting for that moment since I left the theater. Both times!!Beautiful piece of art...........I am a die hard Jake Gyllenhaal fan and this is his best work ever.

2277,lucycohen,An Oscar for Best Music for that score!!??!! What gives?,2,12 March 2006,"I am amazed once more at the people that give out Oscars.Are they so completely prisoner of the hype and the publicity that they don't even bother to listen to the music scores anymore? I mean, the score to Brokeback Mountain isn't bad. It's fine. It's just nothing special.It's made up of a not particularly memorable melody with uninspired strings in the back, and then it repeats itself.It's definitely not the stuff that Rocky, Star Wars or even Titanic was made of.Of course, when you look at the history of the academy awards, you discover the predilection towards the bland and the mediocre (sometimes even the outright bad in the acting categories) and a snub of a lot of really quality works.While they may have thought it would be boring to give John Williams yet another award, it would have been a lot better for their reputation than giving it to yet another mediocre score.",Brokeback Mountain

I hear the music from the soundtrack and score and I can feel the emotions of the movie in the music. The unaffected true love story of these men is astonishing and passionate. As you walk in the first time to watch this film, you hear everything from ""the gay cowboy movie"" to much much worse comments. And honestly, in the first love scene, I knew I was watching two men. But as the movie went on, and I have mentioned this fact to many colleagues and friends, you forget that this is supposed to be forbidden or wrong according to society. All you see is love in it's absolute truest form and nothing can escape that fact.",Brokeback Mountain

No other movie of 2005 came closer to achieving this as Brokeback Mountain.Hollywood take note, it's not big guns, big stars, big tits or big budgets that make great films. What makes a GREAT film is; a great story with emotional impact, good directing, good acting, good cinematography, and good music that make a film great.",Brokeback Mountain
2280,w-schalaba,Reminds me of something,8,13 March 2006,I really liked the way the story of these two men unfolded.The day and age back then must have been hard to be gay or bi.As I watched I felt for Jack Twist as his feelings were very similar to mine with my partner.It's so hard to lead a double life and keep your true feelings for one another hidden.I saw it with a straight friend and all night it was a topic we talked about.I did find it hard to watch as my partner and I are spending a little time from each other. I came away thankful that we are in a relationship in 2006 opposed to the 60's or 70's. A very sad ending brought to mind a story of a young gay male killed in Wyoming,Brokeback Mountain

However I don't think I will be as moved by a love story again as long as I live. This film has made movie history and will become a torchlight film for sure Two men living a lonely existence and moving in and out of each others lives made me think of some of my own experiences in life and although I didn't shed a tear while watching It has left me with a profound respect and understanding for those who feel they cannot live openly in our society and made me realises that i'm one of the lucky ones! stunning performances by all the cast, I will watch this over and over as you have probabley guessed i am not a movie critic or film buff but felt compelled to write this as films like this come once in a lifetime!",Brokeback Mountain
2282,theyellowleaf,Pity and Fear,10,14 March 2006,"Okay, sorry, but here's another one of those reviews that start: ""I've never been moved to comment on a movie before like this, but...""Folks, there's a social phenomenon going on here, plain and simple. Just about everybody with an open mind who sees this movie seems to get swept right away by it. Read the previous user reviews - a sense of grief, sleepless nights, lines of dialogue popping unexpectedly into the mind, the desire to revisit the movie again and again - and make no mistake: this movie has become an instant classic, and we're privileged to be bobbing up and down in the wake as it spreads across the world. Brokeback Mountain is going last for a long time. In 50 years, writers will be hunting down the last surviving members of the cast and crew in an effort to squeeze some new detail out of them to add to all the other books that will have been written about it by then, and those of us still alive will be thinking, ""I saw it when it first came out and, boy, it really messed me up for a while."" Different people have different ideas about this movie. That's how it should be. Great art is always ambiguous. People have been arguing for 400 years about why Hamlet procrastinated or about what the smile on the Mona Lisa's face really means. The funny thing about great art is, all the different interpretations put up against it seem to work pretty well, no matter how different they seem to be from our own view. Brokeback Mountain is full of this ambiguity, and that's why it has affected so many of us, so much. No matter who we are, we've all felt some of Jack's hurt and Ennis's pain some time in our lives - and if we haven't yet, we know that one day we probably will.In that great last scene, we are confronted with our most profound fear: that no matter how secure and good life feels right now, one day we may find ourselves totally alone and crippled by regret. You don't think so? Well, just wait until you lose someone you care about and you suddenly realise that no matter what you do, it's just too damn late now to tell that person how much they meant to you. ""Jack, I swear..."" Swear what, Ennis? That you didn't know how much he loved you? But you did. That you didn't mean it when you said, ""It's because of you I'm like this."" But you did. That if Jack were still alive, you'd stay with him forever and to hell with other people? Friend, it's just too late for that.To see Ennis in his cruddy little trailer, devoid of hope and certain of only one thing - that the one person who ever loved him with passion is gone forever without knowing he was loved in return - well, it practically broke my heart. Yours too, I guess; that's why you're reading all these reviews. Sure, when it happens to us maybe, like Ennis, we can bury our face in some tangible piece of the past, like an old shirt, but we know eventually even that will lose its potency, and then we'll have nothing left but memories. There are other movies that have dealt with rejected love and appalling loss, but surely few that have touched peoples' hearts with such power. The irony of it is that Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal seemed to be pretty average actors up until now. Who would have thought they had this in them? Same for all the costars. There's only one possibility - whether they realised it or not, they were all lifted and inspired by this story, just as we all were, and this impelled them to reach into their souls and produce the performance of a lifetime. Who knows, maybe none of them will ever be this good again - but then again, they don't really need to be, do they? Producing one masterpiece is enough for any life. Take a bow, all of you who were involved in making this fine, cathartic film. You did well.",Brokeback Mountain
2283,juliea077,Love and tragedy,10,14 March 2006,"Brokeback Mountain describes the beautiful scene in which much of the story takes place. I loved it so much that I have seen it in theatres 3 times and will buy it the moment it is available. A man on the radio yesterday said parts of it pulled him in almost uncontrollably, I feel the same way and now feel like I live in it. The love story teaches us that love is universal and prejudice creates harm and fear, and tragedy. The acting was just incredible - Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal were superb. I am grateful that this movie was produced, also to the writers and the director. And, to the casting professional who selected the actors.",Brokeback Mountain

We spent some time there. I could empathize with the feelings of the characters. ""Men don't touch other men out here,"" my partner told me.A strange phenomena was, since, I'm sorry to say, I'd never seen any movie with any of the four main characters in them, I ""met"" them on screen for the first time. Though I know it was ""only a movie,"" I felt as if it was a carefully produced documentary, in particular, of these two men. Even though I had seen them on the Oprah show, that vision evaporated and I left the theater as if I'd seen two REAL people suffering those gut-wrenching experiences.I had heard different reports about the film, but I had no idea what I was ""walking into."" The scene when Jack is pulling away from the trailer, leaving Ennis behind, I was sure the truck would stop and in the distance, be seen by Ennis turning around with the next words uttered being, ""Get your ass in this truck and lets get out of here."" But when he continued to roll out of sight, Uh Oh, I knew this wasn't going to be a Mary Popping flick.And because my partner died twelve and a half years ago, and though not living in a trailer, my existence is somewhat similar; Ennis Del Mar is still living in that bleak lonely environment and I feel for him.",Brokeback Mountain
2285,abbachristians,it broke my heart so much,10,15 March 2006,"The true is that I was in love so much by someone who i miss so much. They were many years of happiness, and solitude, but i couldn't continue with him, because he though some things about me because the friends who i had, but in fact i was so shy and nervous, I think that i Lost him because of my personality, we were young, i don't know if he tried by the first time this kind of relation with me, but i love him so much, We never couldn't give a kiss in the lips because of my shy. I met him in the high school, we were friends firstly, after high school, we continued studying but he was with girls and the same time he was with me, it hurt ed to me, but i loved him, he got married, I broke with him, by respect to her wife who was my friend, the years passed, he had 2 babies with her, he came back to my life when he assisted many times to the disco, but i ignored him, many times too, (but i loved him so much). I tried to forget him but I felt so depressed, the love that i feel, is so strong more than the universe, the real love which couldn't breath because i was so shy and stupid, i never said him I LOVE YOU, never he told me it too. it was in 1996 And our history finish because i had dignity and respect. But i lost many relations, many good moments in respect to the love which i had for him.But the time is passing, now is 2006 and I miss him, i am alone yet. i have many things to say him, many things to share with him, i am already not shy and quiet, i have changed. i want to see him again, i miss him a lot of. I tried in all those years forget him, with the music of ABBA, or studying act which i like so much, i tried fall in love with someone who lives in Europe or USA, in spite of I have my own website from 1999 with many pictures. but, nobody really interested for me write to me, nobody fall in love with me, (maybe for my work time or maybe because i am not good chatting on line) I live only form y work, for my family and my friends who are heterosexuals, I preferred to have friends like that, because, gay people in discos are so arrogant or empty or only want sex and no more, the real love doesn't exits in them. And i hate the gay clubs they are only sex. i want more than this. I feel so alone, my friends have her girlfriends, my female friends the same, but I don't have someone for me, it depressed to me so much.The years are passing, I am not 18 like i met him, now I am alone I am 27, I am afraid of be 30 and continue alone.The years have passed i don't know where is he living, some friends of him told me that he is in Argentina, others told me that he is in USA. The years are passing quickly, and I have only 2 photos of him, and only the 9 notebooks diaries where I write everything about us, i keep with me only memories......only memories, and the high school (my mountain) where i met him, but this place is empty without him.like the movie, I have a beautiful family, but I am alone now, living only with memories that are killing to me.I was so quiet, living the life with my friends, my family, my good job, but I saw 3 days ago this movie, today i saw it again and it hurts to me deeply, i don't know what i am going to do, I can't to she this feeling with my family or my friends they know that i am gay, but they are not going to understand me.This movie now is the best that I have, it hurts to me, but it the best that have happened to me. I wasn't waiting it but It is like my life. And Iam alone, i feel so alone and this solitude is killing me, the songs of this movie are part of my life now, and the pictures and the movie. everything is rounded on my mind every time, every shoot of the movie, and i am so depressed these days.The history continues in my own web: http://abbachristians.tripod.com/chrisamor.html christians_99163864@hotmail.com",Brokeback Mountain

I am surprised at the number of people who found the homosexuality an issue, but then maybe that's because I grew up in Brighton...for me this was a tragic love story, all the more tragic because it was forbidden. I found the emotional intensity of the film almost overwhelming and completely believable, and it left me feeling as bruised as the characters.The soundtrack complemented the haunting and despondent atmosphere of the film perfectly (I believe that a film cannot be brilliant without an excellent soundtrack), and I am hopelessly trying to have enough money to buy it, so I can relive the movie. The actors were perfectly suited to their characters (not to mention that Jake and Heath are very cute!), and their emotions transfered brilliantly onto the screen. I also thought that the supporting roles of the wives were excellently acted, and added a real depth to the movie. This has to be one of the best films of all time, and I am anxiously awaiting the release of the DVD. I hope that everyone can get as much enjoyment from it as I did :)",Brokeback Mountain

It's very realistic movie, I didn't feel anything special like ""wow, cool!"" when I was watching. However, when I stepped out the cinema, I started to think about what happened, and why it happened that way. It's a very good movie to make people think about it even after the show. Some say it praises the two guys when they ""brtray"" their wives, and smear the straight people and the wives. However, what I see is how the people love others, how Elma endured the whole thing and how she tried to get her husband back. Ennis had a great responsibility to his family, and so to Jack. He's very poor, but he tried his best for them. Jack didn't sleep with those guys he knew. He didn't want to love other guys, so he slept with women, or went to Mexico. Lureen covered for her husband after his death. She didn't want people to know how ""dirty"" that man was. It's how they love others, and it's the most touching element that I see. Jack's parents were Chtistians, but they somehow accepted him, because nothing is more important than a family. You watch this movie, think about it, and learn from it.",Brokeback Mountain

2290,princeton-1,I was so bored!,2,23 March 2006,"True, ""Crash"" was not the best ""Best Picture"" but it was better than ""Brokeback Mountain""! ""Brokeback"" was a BEAUTIFULLY filmed piece of trifle. It deserved ""Best Adapted Screenplay"" merely for pulling off the feat of dragging out a trite short story and making it a 134 minute motion picture that was about 34 minutes too long. It was so dull I couldn't wait until the sex scene. The sex was jarring and totally void of romance or sensuality, for that matter. After that, I eventually lost interest, as I found no reason to root for them as a couple. One thing of which I am certain that Brokeback Mountain was much ado about nothing! Here's more reasons why:1) There wasn't a whole lot going on other than the guys aging, fishing, having sex and lying. 2) They were in lust not love . . . nothing more than sex partners. Other than the annual sex date they had no contact with each other. It was the gay equivalent of 1978's Same Time, Next Year staring Alan Alda and Ellen Burstyn -- except with less emotional connection. You want tender love between men see 2002's Jagger and Yossi. It wasn't great but it was sweet. I have to see 1982's Making Love. I heard that was groundbreaking! It escapes me why people find this story significant. 3) The relationship wasn't realistic -- based the consensus from myself and the gay people I know. It was more than obvious that the story was written by a straight woman and adapted by a straight man and another straight woman. It was a gay story that straight people could handle. 4) Ennis was so ""normal"" most of the time. The only time he was tormented was when he was with Jack and they were about to part. 5) The movie came across as being told from an omnipresent point of view and then switches when it is convenient to move the SLOW story along. Did some of the stuff happen or was it a dream? 6) At a pivotal scene in the movie, when Ennis should have shown great emotion, he showed very little. Ennis cried before, so why not then or at least afterward? 7) After the pivotal scene, instead of ending the movie there, they dragged it out. There was no resolution or character display of coming to terms with life. It was just a ploy to keep me from getting up to go to the restroom. Sorry, there you go. No prize for them",Brokeback Mountain
2291,tcmangan,"truth is beautiful, but it can hurt",10,18 March 2006,"Friends said Brokeback Mountain was a bit slow. From the start I knew I was in Mahler territory - a symphonic structure was unfolding on the screen. Like great music, this film lives outside time but is shaped by time. It stays with you, living in your soul.I have always struggled to enjoy Romeo and Juliet. But in this great film I can at last feel a work is expressing and presenting with power, and in an inward way, the dreadful inexorable struggle between the individual person and the society he/she lives in. Ennis says if you can't fix it you gotta just stand it, and that is one of the most enraging, truthful, and bitterly fulfilling things one can say about this life. This is why, apart from its great visual and musical beauty, the film has such universal appeal, why teenagers and old men find it reaches into their being and stays there (I'm nearly 57, nearly twenty years on from Jack Twist when the story ends - hey, we're almost contemporaries!).Hats off to the actors. The women carried a huge burden in this film and I cannot imagine stronger performances than Ann Hathaway and Michelle Williams gave. They both were in a situation, to use Jack's heavy word. Mr Ledger reminded me of Russell Crowe in A Beautiful Mind, finding ways to express the inexpressive. But Mr Ledger goes deeper.The guts and feeling and truth and beauty are all there in Annie Proulx's short story masterpiece. The film is a great interpreter of the story and a masterpiece in its own right - like Guernica, like the Kindertotenlieder.

2292,alexachi,Overrated boring movie that fails to move.,4,19 March 2006,"This movie takes too much time to tell the very thin story. This results in a boring product that absolutely fails to move the audience. Acting is reasonably good, though far from superb. The ""first-sex"" scene is highly improbable as the two men, not experienced in gay sex, immediately begin to have anal intercourse without any fore-play. Typical view on gay sex by straight writers. This film could have helped gay emancipation in the sixties. In this century it is totally redundant. There are many scenes with leaving and arriving pick-up trucks which adds to the boredom. Photography of the scenery is brilliant, but eventually does not save this overrated film.",Brokeback Mountain
2293,melp23,Beautiful,9,5 April 2006,"This film is an amazing work of art in every shape and form. Ang Lee creates a masterpiece of social commentary that reflects the obstacles of love. First of all, this is not a gay film, it is a compassionate love story. It shows two people who fall in love with one another and who are forbidden to act upon that love because of the penalties that society will embark. This film is set in the 60's, so homosexual culture is not embedded into culture yet. The two characters then live a lie, as they both marry and have children. However, in their married lives they seem to be unhappy, struggling with the daily tasks of pleasing their family. Their only peace comes when they are with one another and then, they are truly themselves.The acting in the film is poetic. I do have to admit that Philip Seymore Hoffman rightfully deserved the academy award for best actor, however Health Ledger's role as Ennis, is one for the ages. His stoic cowboy role displayed all of his anger and pain without words. Even as time goes on in the film and Ennis gets older, you can notice his age, not because of any noticeable makeup, but because of the pain that Ledger is able to display. He held a lot of weight on his shoulders, and you could notice it through his eyes. Ledger has come a long way from doing teen movies and bad thrillers. This is a career defining role, and even though he may never have anything like this again, this role alone makes him a success.I do have to admit that it does take a certain level of maturity and open-mindedness in order to enjoy this film. I am not gay and I thought that this is one of the best films I had ever seen. You just need to really appreciate great film making and understand how difficult it was for these two characters to act in this manner.

Later that evening, we made furious, passionate love for the first time in many months. The next morning, Brokeback was still with me.

I saw Brokeback Mountain a few days ago and was deeply moved by the powerful story.I do not agree that Brokeback Mountain is primarily a love story where the lovers happen to be gay and their love is made impossible by public opinion.It is Ennis who is totally incapable to cope with who he is. He is a prisoner of his own limitations. That's the real tragedy. That's the difference to Romeo & Juliet.When I think of all the persons that live miserable lives, because they are forced into something they are not, it makes me sad and angry at the same time. When will people finally understand, that the love two persons feel for each other can never be wrong? I still manage to break out in tears when I let my mind wander. When Ennis gets his final letter back, I felt like stabbed in the heart. The impossible had happened. All the failures of the past became obvious in this very moment.The acting in the last part is superb. When Jack's mother lays her hand on Ennis' shoulder to accept him as her second son, no words are needed to tell all their misery and despair. Upstairs, in Jack's room, Ennis shows his readiness to truly open his heart for Jack for the first time. Too late.I think what moves people most about Brokeback Mountain is that it shows our deepest fear: To live a life of missed opportunities, of things that could have been but were not.So start changing your life today. Not tomorrow, not next week. Because one day, the person you dearly love will die and then you will be left behind with nothing but a bloodstained shirt.",Brokeback Mountain

As the movie progressed, I became aware that I was seeing a movie of great significance. Superb acting, majestic cinematography, incredible dialog, intense emotion, cogent storyline, and the excellent score converged into making this two-hour-plus movie one of the great landmarks in the history of the cinema. I agree with those who say that this movie will be discussed and studied, along with the great ones: Casablanca, Citizen Kane, etc.The last twenty minutes of the movie comprise some of the most gut-wrenching and emotionally painful experiences I have ever encountered in a movie. I can't get this movie out of my mind and heart. I cried a number of times in the days following the movie. My wife and I had a number of conversations in an attempt to come to grips with this movie's profound impact. I have recommended this movie to a number of people who scoffed at the idea of seeing a ""gay movie."" This reaction both angers and depresses me. Yes, there is a gay context to the movie, but regardless of gender or sexual orientation, it contains universal themes of love, intense longing, disappointment, infidelity, passion and sexual desire, all of which are applicable to all people, everywhere and anywhere.The few seconds of watching the murder (yes, I do believe he was murdered) of the loving and lovable Jack Twist were almost too overwhelming and shocking for me to bear. This movie will be remembered for years and years to come.",Brokeback Mountain
2300,julygem19,Brokeback was one of the best movies I've ever seen.,10,24 March 2006,"This movie was awesome. It was such a good story... Everyone is looking for love, and it comes in an unexpected way sometimes. Sometimes you are even afraid to make 'the leap' (Ennis) and follow your heart, but in the end you need to, to go on living... This movie is for people of all orientations because love is appreciated by all, and being in the presence of it makes you feel good. The casting was perfect: Jake Gyllenhaal and Heath Ledger did an amazing job. + Michelle Williams was outstanding. I give Brokeback Mountain two thumbs way up. It was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. I wish Ledger had won best actor. Go see this movie, you won't regret it.",Brokeback Mountain
2301,sb035995,"Thank you, Michelle Williams",4,25 March 2006,"I have seen this movie yesterday, and the day before yesterday I read the novel. The movie stays close to the novel, except for the character of Heath Ledger, Ennis Del Mar. What is Heath trying to say? I am scared to live? I think a lot of people will find this movie boring, because Heath does not portray an average guy with whom you can identify. I can relate to Jake Gyllenhaal's personage. He has at least a drive, and so does Michelle Williams character. Both Jake and Michelle are light points in this movie, but it is a pity that Heath Ledger's character is the main figure. At the end of the movie, he cries at seeing the two shirt he has hung up in his closet. My question: every time he opens the closet, does he cry? Heath's acting is really bad. Even I can play Ennis. Just press your lips together, put your eyebrows together and there you are: Mr negativity. I guess the Academy nominated this movie to make people go to this movie. That is why this movie did not actually won an Oscar. And by Jove, they succeeded! I thought this movie would get into my heart, but instead I just didn't understand the motivation of Ennis. I never really was a fan of Michelle Williams, but she plays her character well and understandable. So: thank you Michelle.",Brokeback Mountain
2302,kimpetasim,a truly amazing film.,10,25 March 2006,"whether you are for homosexuals or against homosexuals, you will watch this film in aw and amazement of the film that is ""broke back mountain"" this film is one of the best movies i have ever seen, it is well thought out, well made, and the acting is amazing. well done Ang Lee for such an outstanding film.the film is about two 19 yr old lads who go to work for a ranch handler in Wyoming in the summer of 1963, Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal).

2303,Glenngrover,Truck (Pick Up) Parking ??,10,16 April 2006,"I may be wrong only seeing the movie four times however, in the beginning when Jack arrives on the old truck at the foreman's office does he not park the truck ""motor in"" (against the wall) and later on when he and Ennis have gotten to know each other (literally) and comes times to part, isn't Jack's truck facing ""motor out"" (away from the wall) because they are both trying to start the truck again?? Did someone turn the truck around when they were up at BB Mountain? Any comments please ?? I would have said ""parked the ute"" but only my brothers and sisters Down Under would know what I meant!Ennis - "".....then why don't you just let me be""",Brokeback Mountain
2304,peterboyer,'Brokeback' is an amazing journey,10,26 March 2006,"This is an amazing achievement - not just by Ang Lee, but also by Heath Ledger, Jake Gyllenhaal, Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway, and all the rest of the cast - not to mention the exceptional cinematography and the breathtaking natural landscape of 'Brokeback'. Ang Lee has created as near-perfect a movie as I'm ever likely to see. The two lead actors deserve our deepest gratitude for their courage in taking on this most difficult of acting tasks, and for carrying it through with such skill and subtlety and grace. 'Brokeback' takes you on an amazing journey. I'm a heterosexual male, and I always have and always will feel uncomfortable about male-male sex, because I suppose I'm programmed to be that way. But Lee, Ledger and Gyllenhaal take you through that discomfort and lead you to where we should all be - understanding the need of all people for love, of whatever kind, and sympathizing with all who suffer torment and abuse and loss in this quest. Above all 'Brokeback' is about love - mostly about homosexual love, but also about love between men and women and fathers and their children. In confronting the matter of how communities deal with homosexuality, it brings the issue in from the cold, bringing it into a place that is familiar to and belongs to us all. It is, at the end of it all, no more and no less than a great love story.",Brokeback Mountain
2305,Flikkie513,Best Movie Ever,10,27 March 2006,"Brokeback Mountain is by far the best love story of the year and will go down in history as a classic love story which touches the lives of all who see it. What makes this movie great isn't just the jaw-dropping good looks of Heath and Jake but rather the emotion and passion exhibited by 2 forbidden lovers. In this movie we witness a love of the hardest kind. It isn't the story of 2 gay cowboys at all, it's the story of two people who happen to fall in love and painfully aren't able to live a life together. But since they can't fix it.. they must find a way to stand it. I've seen the movie in theaters 4 times and am counting down the seconds until April 4 comes along so I can purchase the movie.. I own the book and the soundtrack. If anyone is afraid to see this movie because saddly it's been tagged as the gay cowboy movie.. I suggest you see it for yourself for what it really is.",Brokeback Mountain
2306,Savark,"Broke""Blah"" Mountain",1,27 March 2006,"This was one of the most boring films I have ever seen. I really don't get why so many in the gay community are glowing over this film. This is not a good film for the community. When the hell are these self proclaimed liberal film makers going to get it. I'm tired of seeing movies where the villain is gay or the only reason you get to like the character is because he's suffering. Gays have happy endings too. That IS real life.1. Heath Ledger: Not an Oscar award winning performance. Marlon Brando could give this kid lessons in diction. I could barely make out a word he said. 2. The Love scene or lack there of: I've never seen a more awkward attempt at making love and kissing. These guys should give up acting now. They both looked uncomfortable and disgusted at what they were doing. 3. What's love got to do with it: When do we ever get to see these actors in love and enjoying themselves? The only time we get to see them happy, the camera pulls away so we can see the disapproving sneer of their boss."" I didn't pay them boys to do this"". 4. When will Hollywood learn: There appears to be an unwritten rule in Hollywood that a character can't be gay unless he's dying, unhappy, victimized or victimizing. The Gay community is tired of being portrayed at villains, psychos, degenerates, or diseased and unfortunate ""lost souls"". In Philadelphia, we are allowed to like Tom Hanks because he's dying (never-mind the fact that you never see him and Antonio share any physical signs of affection). 5. The pacing of the movie was very slow. This was not an entertaining film. It was beautifully photographed but not very entertaining.This film teaches us that Gays are doomed to loneliness and misfortune and miserable, unhappy lives and grizzly deaths at the hands of ignorant bigots. Speaking of which, Christians are actually using this movie as propaganda to show their congregation that you, too, will be doomed if you give in to their ""wicked Homosexual desires"".I hated this film.",Brokeback Mountain
2307,kcrunner,"devastating,inspiring",10,28 March 2006,"When I first went to see this movie like most people is was out of curiosity however I was hooked almost immediately. Heath Ledger is amazing and it is heartbreaking to watch him constantly toiling with himself. My favourite scene is their reunion after 4 years apart and Ennis is so overwhelmed he goes against all his beliefs and shows his emotions where there is the risk of them being seen. Jack looks confused until Ennis kisses him and then it all emotion returns. After watching this movie I was unsettled, disturbed, upset for a couple of days and started to think I was going a bit crazy. It is only a movie I kept telling myself.........I then logged on and felt so relieved that so many people were affected the same way as me. Initially I never wanted to see the movie again because of how bad it made me feel however I must confess that I have watched it again and spent most of the time smiling at the humour they share and crying at Jack's desperation to be with Ennis (the travelling from Texas when he heard about the divorce was heartbreaking) and Ennis's slow decline from basking in the love the share to the realisation that he will never allow them to be together. I am not an avid film fan so don't feel qualified to comment on direction,cinematography etc however how this film cannot touch everyone hearts fails me unfortunately the specific area this movie looks at IE society and it's attitude towards homosexuality is the very reason many people will never see this film. I can't believe how much I keep thinking about this film but I am glad to see that I am not alone. Part of me wants to see it again but the anguish and torment I feel for the characters is stopping me - I will give it a while before I cry again. It does dismay me how in our society people are forced to live a lie for fear of how they will be accepted. We should accept people for who/what they are after all those are the very things that conspire to create the people we know and love.",Brokeback Mountain
2308,baniukiewicz,Boring,3,28 March 2006,"This is one of the most boring movies I've seen in a long time. It seems to have gotten popular because it's about homosexuality, but for me this alone is not enough to impress. The story is uneventful, not very original, and the long gaps of time in it show just how unimportant everything around it is. It's all too obvious that the film is trying to get its popularity by jumping on the fashionable forced-controversy bandwagon. Unfortunately this time making the lead characters gay doesn't work to make it interesting. I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie. It's not only boring, but also tries too hard to provoke the audience to feel the pain of the lead characters. It doesn't feel natural.",Brokeback Mountain
2309,mdbtaa2006,I'm thinking of moving to Brokeback Mountain,10,28 March 2006,"I'm a gay man so of course I'm probably very biased. However, the manner in which these two MARVELOUS actors, Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenthal, authentically portray two men who fall in love with each other is nothing short of stunning. Clearly, neither one was prepared for the omnipotent force and gripping power of LOVE. And, just to be fair, they were in LOVE; this was no casual, hormone and curiosity-driven one-time roll in the hay.Trust me, I know. As a gay man myself I've had at least several hundred sexual encounters, but I've been in Love only 5 times. This film didn't just bring a few tears to my eyes; I left the theater bawling like a baby, doing nothing to conceal the extent to which this film MOVED ME, emotionally and spiritually. For the first time I truly felt validated. To the judgmental, bible-thumping bigots who claim that this Ang Lee masterpiece is nothing more than a ""low grade gay cowboy flick"" I say this: ""Judge ye not lest ye be judged ..."" and ask, ""Is this how Jesus would act?"" Love is not only a force of nature; Love is THE most powerful force in the universe and especially right now, this world could certainly use a lot more Love. As the late great John Lennon wrote: ""All you need is Love"".",Brokeback Mountain
2310,Sorayyaa,If I could rate this movie more than 10 I would,10,5 April 2020,"One of the saddest movies I've ever seen, I watched it more than 5 times and every time it made me cry, specially after Heath Ledger death and when I realized what Jake Gyllenhaal did for his daughter... All these make me sad. It's about the power of love even out of movie.",Brokeback Mountain
2311,j-major,archetypes,8,21 June 2006,"I like to think of Ennis and Jack as archetypes. I think that they both portray two very different social paradigms. I think their interactions are a microcosm of one aspect of the last 300 years (say) of GLBT issues.For me Ennis represents a conservative worldview. In this schema, which incidentally existed in the west for many centuries, it was known and accepted that gay sex happened and it was technically illegal, but largely turned a blind eye to. A man's primary role was to get married and produce heirs. What he got up to in his private life was generally speaking his own concern, so long as he didn't speak of it in polite company. It wasn't really until the late 19th or early 20th centuries that sodomy was hunted out and judicially punished on a substantial scale. Until then it was mostly ignored.Jack represents the progressive liberal for whom this kind of double life is anathema. Sure, he lives a double life (he is forced to in some respects) but on several occasions he offers to give it up for Ennis. We are left with the strong impression that he would have given it up for Ennis, had Ennis agreed to live with him. Ennis, by far the more pragmatic of the two, is resigned to his fate. It is not what he would choose, but it is what the fates have dished out and he believes it is his duty  he will do what he must do not what he wants to do: ""If you can't change it, you've got to stand it.""In my opinion, Jack wins in the end. He dies a tragic hero, unhappy in love and yet consistently ready to be brave and constantly urging Ennis to be brave with him. In the end he dies morally uncompromised and a martyr for the cause.Ennis is the one left behind to wonder 'what if?' I almost felt the pain when Ennis visited Jack's parents and Jack's father so dismissively told him Jack had another man he planned to bring to Texas.",Brokeback Mountain
