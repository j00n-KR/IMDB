0,TheLittleSongbird,Somehow manages to be the worst of the four,4,21 July 2014,"This is not coming from a Transformers detractor. Most of the animated series are really entertaining and well made, and the animated film likewise. Of the live-action films, the first was enjoyable, Revenge of the Fallen for me wasn't that terrible but had a lot wrong with it and Dark of the Moon was mediocre. With Age of Extinction, it's not quite as awful as it has been made out to be but I do consider it the worst of the four and agree with the complaints.Of course there are a few bright spots. The special effects are exceptional and the robots are fantastically constructed. The sound is thrilling in its authenticity and the music is enough to pump the adrenaline. Stanley Tucci is a lot of fun as the most colourful character in the entire film(although admittedly he does overact at the end), the Monument Valley sequence is the most thrilling of the action sequences and Peter Cullen is note perfect as Optimus Prime, it is very difficult to think of anyone else to voice that character.Unfortunately the flaws really outweigh the bright spots. The film is far too long by about an hour, it is the longest Transformers film and with the plodding pacing and the bloated plotting it feels like it is. Some have said Age of Extinction has no story, for me the problem was the opposite in that the film was bloated with too much padded filler and tried to do too much. Because of that, things were underdeveloped and the whole story became incoherent. But the not enough story complaint is valid too, because actually the film also doesn't become close to sustaining the mammoth length. Even more of a problem was that the film had too many human scenes and not enough of the robots.Which was a big problem, because the human scenes were not interesting in the slightest with the human villains being overly evil with weak motivations and the father/daughter/boyfriend subplot feeling like soap-opera padding and it takes up far too much of the film. The scenes with the robots had a lack of tension, fun or excitement, the writing doesn't help it but just as problematic is how really bland the robots' personalities are apart from Optimus. The Lockdown and Galvatron plot lines had potential but probably would have been better working in two separate films. The dinobots don't even show up until really late in(last 40 minutes?) and they turn out to be useless. Apart from Cullen the voice acting was not that special, John Goodman and Ken Watanabe providing voices promised much but they had very little to work with, talent being wasted is a pet peeve of mine regarding films.Also terrible is the script, which has the subtlety of a sledgehammer and is laden with tiresome clichés and cheap lowbrow humour that makes that of Revenge of the Fallen seem tame. The action sequences worked in the first three, they don't here. Aside from them being so poorly edited that it was confusing making out what was going on and to the point it was seizure-inducing, they got increasingly repetitive and dull. So instead of feeling thrilled the only feeling I got was boredom, and that was true of a lot of the audience in the cinema. And the acting is really not good(neither was Michael Bay's smug and self-indulgent direction), changing the cast did seem a welcome decision but it was a decision that did not pay off. Mark Wahlberg is decent in the action sequences(better than Shia LaBoeuf) but is completely passionless everywhere else. Nicole Peltz has the worst dialogue of Age of Extinction and she spends the whole time screaming them. Jack Reynor is bland personified in the most clichéd role, in a film filled with clichéd, personality-free and annoying characters that's quite a feat, and Sophia Myles is wasted. Disappointing also is Kelsey Grammar, who really overdoes it in a role that he is not hard-edged enough for.In conclusion, has its moments but has several big problems that make it a not terrible but quite lacklustre entry to the series. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Transformers - Age of Extinction
1,SnoopyStyle,loud unfunny mess that wears me out,4,11 March 2015,"Transformers were here during the age of the dinosaurs. Darcy Tirrel (Sophia Myles) finds some remains in the Arctic. After the destruction of Chicago, the alliance with Autobots have ended. Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammar) creates US black ops group Cemetery Wind to hunt down all Transformers with the help of Cybertronian bounty hunter Lockdown. Attinger is working with Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci) who runs private corporation KSI. Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) and bumbling Lucas Flannery (T.J. Miller) are pickers in Texas. Cade buys an interesting looking wreck truck despite his daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz)'s objections. Cade has no money and none of his inventions actually work. However his truck might be more than meets the eye. When Attinger's men come, Tessa's boyfriend Shane (Jack Reynor) rescues them.The Michael Bay style is not funny although he keeps trying. The unrelenting one liners really get annoying. The non-stop ridiculous action has a charming outrageous quality. The whole Cemetery Wind is way over the top. Their problem is that they are cartoon characters more than any of the Transformers. Attinger is a nonsense character that needs background explanation that never comes. He hates Transformers so much that he wants to kill them all. But he's doing a deal with another Transformer. They try to explain away the paradox by introducing the Seed. However it's Joyce who wants the Seed more. Joyce makes a bit more sense and Stanley Tucci tries to make it work. It would be better to make Attinger a smaller role as a subordinate. The nonstop action is expected but rather boring after a certain point. I do like the high wire walk because that is really scary to me. The product placement is insane in this movie. There's no need to stop the movie to have a Bud. I stayed engaged with the movie until around the spaceship. This movie simply pounds and pounds on the audience until one surrenders. I give up caring about anybody or anything in this movie. I don't care about the father daughter relationship. The boyfriend is a real dud. The funny T.J. Miller gets killed off early. I barely care about the Autobots. Galvatron could have been a great villain but he has to share the bad guy role.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
2,claudio_carvalho,"I Am not a Fan of This Franchise, but This Movie is Entertaining",7,25 January 2015,"I am not a fan of this franchise, but ""Transformers: Age of Extinction""is entertaining with a great cast. Cade Yeager, the mechatronics engineer that buys an old truck and accidentally repairs Optimus Prime, is a great hero. The villains Harold Attinger and James Savoy are mean and evil. Joshua Joyce is a defense contractor with good intentions that discovered that was lured by Megatron. But the special effects are amazing and certainly the best that this movie can offer. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Transformers: A Era da Extinção"" (""Transformers: Age of Extinction"")",Transformers - Age of Extinction
3,nogodnomasters,THERE'S A MISSILE IN THE FAMILY ROOM,6,10 September 2018,"The movie starts in the Arctic, prehistoric times, Mexico City, Texas, and Chicago. I was expecting good bots vs. bad bots for control of the earth, and got something similar...after all there are so many places a story can go and unfortunately they decided to give us a taste of all of them. Mark Wahlberg, the world's greatest inventor, on the brink of poverty, is introduced early so we know who saves the world while also trying to save his daughter Tessa's (Nicola Peltz) purity. Nicola Peltz is pretty but no substitution for Meagan Fox. I know. I need to move on.As expected Wahlberg does what his overpaid salary commands him to do. I am ready to walk out of the theater and then...they decided to do the same movie all over again in freaking China. I really did like the added family drama and not simply making this a metal on metal movie, but apparently Michael Bay has a brother in the salvage metal business and turned this into an over extended bot contest.The one guy with decent lines gets killed off early. No sense entertaining us with witty dialogue, as that might take away from the mindless special effects. The film was way too long for m",Transformers - Age of Extinction
4,kosmasp,Is it over yet?,3,24 September 2014,"Now don't get me wrong, we as an audience are prone to dismiss a movie because it's too short. As in ""I paid good money to see that, how can it be over yet?"". Not something I do in particular, though I might be slightly disappointed if a really good movie is over. Now Michael Bay is known for making movies that are larger than anything ... but this tries to break a new record in action movie lengths ... Not in a good sense though.Yes you'll get bang for your buck (or whatever currency you paid to watch this). But enough is enough .. should be enough actually, because here it obviously isn't (from Bays perspective). There is little story wise to support the whole thing. You get a model daughter ""helping"" her dad, while her other model friends drive off in a jeep and are never to be seen again ... until the next Victoria Secret commercial that is directed by Bay.But movies do not (always) have to make sense. Bay movies especially, it's about the ride and the effects. Effects wise you have a great movie here. It looks fantastic and you can follow the action most of the time (which is nice and one of the things that might be better than in Part 2). But it is too long for its own good. Just when you think it must be over already there is another hour of chasing and fighting ... and chasing and fighting. And maybe a ""joke"" or two thrown in for good measure. Even the best action set piece gets dragged down by that .. it's a shame, because Michael Bay knows how to direct action and make an entertaining movie. Don't know why he had to make this even bigger and longer than the the other Transformer movies ... I didn't miss Shia or anything (Wahlberg seems to be his new male muse), the movie was just too long ... as is my review by this point!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
5,LeonLouisRicci,If Not Immune or InoculatedBe Prepared to Endure,5,20 October 2014,"Getting Lost in the Sheer, Deadening Deluge of Glaring Metal Madness, are a Few Inspirational Action Scenes that Otherwise Might Impress if Given a Modicume of Setup and Pacing that Could Allow Such Things to Exist in a ""Real World"" to Give the Suspense and Action Just a Little Breathing Room to Happen on its Own.First, there is the Hair-Raising Trip Across Metal (Yep) Wiring that the Cast has to Tightrope. Miles in the Air, or so it Seems, this is a Truly Tuned Suspense (no such luck) Oriented Set Piece that Would Raise Some Hackles if it Stood Alone and Not Within the Expansive, Explosive, and Excruciating Realm of what has Become the Transformers Universe. These Franchise Films Simply Beg the Question...Can there be too Much of a Good Thing?In Director Michael Bay's World that is a Silly Question that Deserves the Silliest of Answers...Of course not, Check the Box Office Receipts.Second, there are the Inspired Scenes where the Evil Doers, this is All Kind of a Blur, Reeking Havoc in Hong Kong, where They Suck the City's Trains, and Boats, and Planes Up into a Spaceship with a Giant Magnet and then Release it All, Like Bombs, Back on the Population. It is Different and Magnificent, but Again, Lost in a Multitude of Other Things Going On it is Forgotten by the Brain, Even Before it Ends, Because the Brain is So Overloaded that Everything On Screen has Been Blended, or More Like Mutilated, into a Mush of Meaninglessness.After Enduring this Slam and Blam Behemoth, You Might Feel the Need to Purchase a Few Products. No Not Bud Light, or Victoria Secrets, but Visine to Wash Out the Stinging Visual Cortex, and some Migraine Medicine to Stop the Head from Pounding. Although, the Target Audience has an Immunity to Such Things and will Not Be Affected. That's the Reason They Get Away with this Type of Insult to the Senses, the Fans are Insulated. But the Rest of the Audience, the Remainder who have Not Been Inoculated from Years of Exposure, Be Prepared to Suffer.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
6,zardoz-13,"Third Best ""Transformers"" Movie!!!",8,1 July 2014,"Although he scrapped the original cast for a company of fresh faces, ""Transformers"" director Michael Bay has changed little else in this sci-fi, fantasy franchise about Hasbro's enormous, shape-shifting, alien robots that exist to smash each other to smithereens. Cast as an entirely different character from Shia LaBeouf's twentysomething Sam Witwicky, Mark Wahlberg portrays a paranoid, single-parent father in the third sequel of Paramount's ""Transformers"" franchise. Wahlberg isn't the only newbie. Five-time Emmy winner Kelsey Grammar of ""Cheers"" skulks around as a sinister CIA spook, while chrome-domed Stanley Tucci behaves like a Victor Frankenstein-style inventor in league with the notorious Grammar. For the record, I rank the original ""Transformers"" marginally above ""Dark of the Moon,"" followed by ""Age of Extinction,"" and then ""Revenge of the Fallen."" ""Reindeer Games"" scenarist Ehren Kruger, who penned the two previous ""Transformers"" tales, assigns everybody, Man and Transformers alike, with more than enough onerous tasks in this fourth installment to rival ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" with its colossal Windy City apocalypse. Inevitably, everything culminates in a larger-than-life smackdown between the Transformers with collateral damage galore. Furthermore, Bay and Kruger have anted up some other surprises. Not only do the Dinobots appear, but also mankind miraculously manages to manufacture Transformers in their research laboratories. Naturally, you'll have to channel your inner adolescence to appreciate the fanciful heroics and outlandish mayhem that this PG-13 blockbuster delivers with predictable regularity throughout its bladder challenging 165 minutes. Whereas the previous ""Transformers"" outings were essentially screwball comedies about titanic toys using major cities as arenas for their pandemonium, ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" doesn't consciously strive to be as absurd as its predecessors. The hare-brained antics of Shia LaBeouf and his dysfunctional family were more amusing that anything Wahlberg and his teen daughter with her rally race car driver boyfriend dream up. Indeed, the quirkiest character in ""Age of Extinction"" doesn't survive the first hour. Meaning, ""Age of Extinction"" isn't a Looney Tunes extravaganza.""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" takes place four years after the monumental battle of Chicago in ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon."" Just as they suggested in the previous ""Transformers"" epic that NASA embarked on lunar exploration simply as a ruse to locate a crashed Cybertronian spacecraft on the moon before the Soviets, Bay and Kruger fantasize that the dinosaurs disappeared as a consequence of aliens exterminating the massive creatures with extreme prejudice. Bay and Kruger waste no time introducing the Dinobots, and the scene in the Arctic where mankind has discovered a Dinobot fossil is eerie. The next thing we know we're in Texas. The new protagonist in ""Age of Extinction"" is Cade Yeager. A crackpot inventor who operates a fix-it service, Cade is a nice guy who wouldn't swat a fly. Cade and his partner Lucas Flannery (T.J. Miller of ""Cloverfield""), a surfer dude out of water, are inspecting a movie theater that the owner wants to renovate when they spot a big-rig truck covered with debris. Cade buys the rig with Lucas' cash, and they haul it back to his barn. Cade plans to strip it for spare parts. Imagine Cade's surprise when Optimus Prime (original ""Transformers"" voice-over artist Peter Cullen) changes his shape. Cade is floored. Not long afterward, a Top Secret commando outfit nicknamed 'Cemetery Wind,' that tracks and destroys Autobots and Decepticons alike, show up at his door. Since the devastating battle of Chicago, the President has dismantled the combined Autobot & Pentagon operation to mop up stray Decepticons. Furthermore, the administration has placed a bounty on all Transformers good or evil. Lucas freaks out at Optimus Prime and alerts Cemetery Wind. Sadly, Lucas is not prepared for the Storm Trooper tactics of James Savoy (Titus of Welliver ""Mulholland Falls"") who resembles a shark in sunglasses and commands Cemetery Wind. Savoy musters more villainy based on his menacing facade and this propensity for violence than his scheming boss, Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammar), who belongs to the Central Intelligence Agency. Attinger has recruited a brilliant inventor, Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci 0f ""The Hunger Games""); to conduct experiments on Megatron's severed head. Attinger wants Joyce to create a man-made line of Transformers, and Joyce possesses the genius to make it happen.My trifling objections with ""Age of Extinction"" lay with the new cast and the change of atmosphere. Basically, I'll watch Mark Wahlberg in just about anything. He makes consistently interesting movies. Moreover, Wahlberg radiates greater charisma than Shia LaBeouf. Unfortunately, Wahlberg plays a largely colorless character. He worries constantly about his teenage daughter, Tessa Yeager (Nicola Peltz), and struggles to keep her on a short leash. Naturally, Tessa hates his micro-managing parental skills. Imagine Cade's surprise when he learns that Tessa has been dating an older fella! Jail bait-looking Nicola Peltz makes a poor substitute for somebody as drop-dead sexy as Megan Fox. Mind you, Fox is no Meryl Streep, but she was built for the ""Transformers"" franchise. Tessa Yeager exists so Cade will fear for her welfare. She serves as the resident damsel-in-distress. As Tessa's reckless boyfriend Shane, Jack Reynor brings little to the action aside from his driving skills that a stunt double performed. The stunts that Shane's daredevil character pulls are impressive, but little about Shane's one-dimensional character is as impressive. Neither Kelsey Grammar's rather ho-hum villain nor Stanley Tucci's deluded inventor overshadow the memory of the insane shenanigans of John Turturro's Agent Simmons in the first three ""Transformers."" Nobody takes over the roles that Josh Duhamel as Captain Lennox and Tyrese Gibson as USAF Tech Sergeant Epps created. Remember, the military is excluded from ""Age of Extinction."" No, you need not have seen the earlier ""Transformers"" trilogy toplining Shia LaBeouf to appreciate this entertaining reboot. The best ""Transformers"" movies boast a multiplicity of shape-shifting robots, and the fourth ""Transformers"" movie meets the quota and then raises the bar. Happily, quiet moments are few and far between in ""Age of Extinction,"" and the battling robots make the third sequel worthwhile escapism.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
7,view_and_review,No Shia and Still No Good,4,1 November 2014,"Michael Bay is known for over the top action with explosions, slow-mo and plenty of destruction. Sometimes that's good, but a lot of times that's not enough to do it.I watched this movie for one primary reason: Shia Labeouf was not in it. He was irritating enough in the first Transformers, but because of its novelty he could not drag the movie down. Well, by parts 2 and 3 I had just about enough of him. Exit Shia Labeouf, enter Mark Walberg.Mark Walberg is a solid enough actor in the right role, but even he was annoying in this one. I thought he was going to bring some maturity to the movie but he only played an immature father. Bay obviously wanted some humor and comedy, but he'd been better off bringing back John Turturro for that.Besides the cast, the Transformer saga was much the same. The fighting was for slightly different reasons, but there was still clanging metal, impossible stunts and nice rides. I'll never tire of them transforming, that is probably the coolest part of the movie. But of course you can't make a 90 minute movie of robots transforming. The robots actually were more entertaining than the people were in every facet.Ultimately, I never finished the movie. I got up to go to the bathroom and decided I was done watching. Any movie that I don't willingly finish I cannot give a good rating to. I don't know, maybe the moral of the story is more robots and less people would make for a better movie.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
8,neil-476,Can there be too much of a good thing,7,14 July 2014,"Several years after the Autobot vs Decepticon battle which levelled much of Chicago, the few surviving Autobots are in hiding. Broke widower inventor and single Dad Cade Yeager buys the ruins of an old truck for spares, only to discover that it is the wounded Optimus Prime. Meanwhile, other forces are at work: the CIA, a hit squad, international business mogul Joshua Joyce, and Lockdown, a Transformer-y type of fellow who is a kind of intergalactic bounty hunter hunting down Optimus Prime. Various of these are allied to various others, albeit possibly only on a temporary basis, but they are all against the Autobots, Cade and his daughter and her boyfriend.This is an incredibly long and bombastic effort, outdoing its predecessors in the franchise by a considerable margin. One appreciates a change of humans (and one can understand an unwillingness on the part of the producers to use the protagonist of the previous 3 films given the extent to which he had become, what 's the word, ""unusual"" over the last year or so), but the running subplot about over-protective dad Cade and his daughter's secret boyfriend overstays its welcome by a wide margin. They boyfriend himself is forgettable, as is the daughter (who were they, again?). Kelsey Grammar is pretty good as the CIA boss, though.The special effects are fine and at least the movie has learned from previous versions that if you're going to have giant robots beating each other up and causing vast urban devastation in the process, you need to be able to tell the goodies from the baddies. Use of colour and distinctive character design have sorted that particular issue out.For such simple fare, the film is massively over-plotted, though, and far too long. Maybe that makes it good value for money.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
9,anaconda-40658,Extinct This Franchise.,5,9 July 2015,"Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014): Dir: Michael Bay / Cast: Mark Wahlberg, Nicola Peltz, Stanley Tucci, Kelsey Grammar, Jack Raynor: Fourth addition to the franchise goes absolutely nowhere in terms of telling a decent story. What it does do is present a better cast than in previous films. Mark Wahlberg plays a Texan struggling to keep his homestead from being taken from him. He invents things out of spare parts and garbage but it often fails. His latest discovery is a transformer, an Autobot leader named Optimus Prime whom he repairs and forms an alliance with when CIA agents blast the place to bits trying to overtake Prime. Nicola Peltz plays Wahlberg's teenage daughter who worries about her dad's well being. Jack Raynor plays her professional racer boyfriend whom Wahlberg was unaware of but his appearance is during the heat of attack where his car and driving skills come in handy. Then confessions and amusing standoff moments follow as Peltz attempts to express her desire to grow. Stanley Tucci steals moments as a brilliant scientist whose skills are required to create robots that are superior to Transformers. This role takes an interesting turn in the third act. Kelsey Grammar puts aside his comic role to portray the sinister corrupt figure authorizing the destruction of the Autobots. Michael Bay creates his usual brilliant special effects that cultivate into destruction of cities and other mindless chaos. The Transformers are a sight going from robots into vehicles and this time the Dinobots rampage through with Prime's leadership. Visually well made but screenplay hits more wrecking balls than Miley Cyrus. Score: 5 / 10",Transformers - Age of Extinction
10,FlashCallahan,Age of exhaustion......,1,13 July 2014,"After Bay made his poisonous 'Arthouse' movie, he comes back with all guns blazing with this, the fourth in possibly the worst franchise of all time.All Transformers are now classed as a threat, so Frasier is leading a literal headhunt for the remaining robots,mot clear the world of aliens and to put more human in humanity.But he has an ulterior motive of course. Stanley Tucci wants the Transformers metal, so he can introduce a new product called, wait for it, Transformium, to build his own army of robots to bring world peace.But silly old Marky Mark has decided to work with Bay again, and inadvertently buys Optimus Prime off some bloke for 150 dollars.And there's two and a half hours of this......As expected, I hated this film, I wasn't looking forward to it, but I give any film a chance. I like the majority of the directors work. I think The Island is a hoot, and The Rock is still one of the best action movies of the last twenty years, but since the first Transformers, I feel like he couldn't give a damn about the audience, as he knows that they will pay to see this anyway.Heaven knows why the film is as long as it is, its a film about robots fighting other robots, and at 160 plus minutes, I really think he's bitten off far more than he can chew. The film is written horribly, the script is laughably horrid, and the film wreaks of stereotypes, racial ignorance and is awfully sexist toward females.The action scenes are all confusing, and again, for the fourth time in a row, you cannot make out who is fighting who, and it's just more of that at the end.I was so close to walking out around the ninety minute mark, and although lots will say, 'well what did you expect?' Or 'leave your brain at the door', well allow me to retort, I expect to be entertained when watching a movie, not offended, and as for the leave your brain.... Statement, that's just for people who are in denial at just how bad the film actually is.But to console my self, after the film, I had a Bud Light, bought some Beats Speakers, Gucci Sunglasses, my girlfriend some Victorias Secret underwear, and my daughter a My Little Pony.......I can't for the life of me understand why, probably some subliminal advertising I saw somewhere.The cinematic equivalent of a portaloo, and the biggest mistake I've ever made going to the cinema.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
11,phd_travel,If you can't beat them join them,3,30 June 2014,I have come to accept that the machines fighting each other all look alike. What makes this better is a clearer story and international locations with battles in Chicago and Hong Kong. The scenes in Hong Kong are quite spectacular. The story is slightly better than the previous one. It's very long at least 45 minutes could have been cut. There is a comical thread to follow - a father daughter boyfriend thing with Mark Wahlberg (looking rather shorter than usual) and the pretty Nicola Peltz from Bates Motel who plays her role well with a hint of white trash sweetness and Jack Reynor (who looks like Chris Pratt) and has a hybrid Irish accent. Kelsey Grammar and Stanley Tucci provide familiar support. Liked Li Bing Bing who fights and has a hilarious one liner. Overall it's slightly better than the last one. Megan made the original work. The last one just suffered because of Rosie Huntington Whitley. So Age of Extinction is okay for a mindless distraction.,Transformers - Age of Extinction
12,Aaron1375,"I liked it better than third, but still not very good",5,10 July 2017,"It saddens me how poorly the Transformers franchise has gone after such a great start with the first film. In that one they hooked you right in with the helicopter attack. The second film was a bloated mess, the third was just too much Shia for my tastes. This one, Shia and his annoying parents are gone (they were okay in the first film, but their comedy got tiresome quickly) and we get an inventor and his daughter and boyfriend because we just have to jam these films in with so many subplots involving the humans that at times you forget these are Transformers films! The cartoon which was used to sell toys had better stories than these films and the movie certainly did! The action in this one is rather good and there are still some cool scenes, but nothing like the opening scene in the first Transformers live action film and certainly nothing as totally awesome as Optimus Prime totally kicking butt in the animated film. In these films, humans have to save the day, and not super humans either, just everyday people that would die within a minute of the blasts going off all around them.The story has a backlash against both Autobots and Decepticons due to the attack on Chicago where if the Autobots had not returned the Decepticons would have brought Cybertron into our atmosphere and used humans as slaves, but apparently everyone forgot that the Autobots saved the day. Well we have evil humans hunting down the robots with another robot which makes no sense, but hey, when does plot matter in these films. Meanwhile, Optimus is in hiding, apparently he took some bad damage from an ambush. Only the Autobots can restore his health or not, not to clear on how he simply got himself back together. Some inventor guy is making his own Transformers that fly apart when transforming and creates Galvatron who turns into a semi like Prime; meanwhile, Lockdown, the robot working with the humans to track down the transformers can turn himself into a cannon which is what Galvatron turns into in the comics. So they apparently cannot do Megatron right the entire series, but then make a random made up robot turn into something Megatron/Galvatron turns into...there is more, but the film ends exactly like the others with a big fight in a city, this time Hong Kong, my guess to kiss the butt of the Chinese so it will do good over there.I liked the Autobots in this one as they were actually kind of distinct. Loved Hound and the one that was like a samurai. Galvatron is pretty much a non factor during the last portion of the film, which is pretty much how Megatron was in the previous film, though at least in that one he got a shot in. The movie is all over the place, there is some good action in it, but the story is a convoluted mess beyond explanation. Apparently, it is the most difficult thing in the world to make a Transformers film where good versus evil, so lets add evil CIA agents, strange inventors that suddenly become important, a whole plot about some creators wanting Prime and a whole slew of subplots about dating and being able to drive! It is just a mess as far as story and the movie is so long! So, this film had its moments, simplify the plot and cut the running time down and it would be more passable. As is it is a bloated mess as far as plot. Then there are moments that make one scratch their head. Like I understand the boyfriend coming in and driving his car during the scene near the beginning with the agents, but at the end of the film they get into a broken down heap and he drives the important device rather than them driving in one of the Autobots. Also, the whole plot where they turn on the Autobots is just stupid especially considering they want to work with another Transformer in Lockdown. Just a lot of crazy stuff going on and then you have the agents who have lost desperate to just kill the good guys; however, why they are in a rush is beyond me. They could just stay in hiding and when everything cools down they can go kill them. Like I said, better than the third, but none of them have the feel the first film had. This franchise should probably be stopped for a while and perhaps rebooted ten or more years down the line.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
13,trashgang,a bit too long but stunning effects and 3D,8,10 December 2014,"So much contradiction with the Transformers franchise, people loving it and people saying it's boring and childish. I'm in between. I still like them because the effects are really stunning again but this time it's way too long to keep you attracted to the screen for almost 3 hours. On the other hand it moves away from the original story somehow and still it still refers to the Decepticons and Autobots. It do has an open ending, again, so I guess the next Transformers has got a green light. I watched it in 3D full HD and on that part it's with open mouth you are going to see the grand opening with the dinosaurs. The 3D used there is really coming into your face, literally. I can even say that that part is the best 3D I have seen so far, even better then The Hobbit up to this writing. Of course you know by now that the Autobots do transfer into cars and this time it's a Chevy galore. You will see Chevy's, the economy cars up to the new yellow Chevy Camaro 2014 special edition and on that part it's boner time and to add more, there's even a muscle car a Camaro SS included. Naturally there are the expensive cars too to see with brand names you never heard of.The story itself is rather simple and it do has it flows. Maybe the ending was a bit too long seeing the bad guy turning into a hero. But you don't watch Transformers for the story but for the effects. The acting was above mediocre that I can say with a bit of predictable situations (daughter and boyfriend) and some humour here and there.Mixed emotions, that's a fact, but I still stand behind the transformers to save earth.

14,mm-39,Not a bad film!,6,2 July 2014,"Surprisingly not a bad film! I did not want to go see Transformers: Age of Extinction. BUT, being a slow summer for movies I decided to take my wife to the movie anyways. Surprisingly, Age of Extinction's story captivates the audience with how people turn on their hero's for their own gain. The hunted Transformers must battle human greed, and thirst for power! Honor and peace means nothing to the unethical is present in Age of Extinction. Age of Extinction has a message about commitment, honour, sacrifice and battling for what is right. All the actors play believable roles. Well written and directed for a comic book movie. A fast pace watchable film. Age of Extinction's story divulges new developments as the movie unfolds. Regrettably, there is the over done special effects climax. However, there is some new twists in the climax with the big magnetic ship and robot dinosaurs. I did not mind Age of Extinction. A six out of ten.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
15,siderite,Cool title. The rest of it sucks.,6,6 October 2014,"I really like Mark Wahlberg, but this film completely misused him. Starting with the annoying loud mouth breathing in the microphone, even if he just moved from one room to another in a completely unexciting setting and continuing with the lousy dialog that was supposed to show him as a wacky overbearing father, but only showed he hated every word he was spouting, Age of Extinction seems to be made to bury Wahlberg as an actor.And then there is the story. Ugh!

The daughter is annoying as hell, intentionally and also unintentionally, while all the characters in the film are utterly forgettable.Bottom line: I remember being impressed with the special effects in one of the Transformers movies and that is the reason I watched this.

And luckily, this Sci-Fi/Action bonanza offers it shares of fun. The action-sequences are explosive, while the graphics are simply astounding. The climatic fight, especially, is maddening. But, the excessive running-time tires you after a point. The film goes on and on and on. 165-Minutes seems a bit too long for a film, that doesn't even take itself seriously. Ehren Kruger's Screenplay is stretched for no reason, but gives enough scope for action. Michael Bay's Direction is fine. Cinematography is superb. Editing isn't crisp. Performance-Wise: Mark Wahlberg is in very good form. Stanley Tucci steals the show, with an over-the-top, yet enjoyable act. Nicola Peltz is alright. Kelsey Grammar is impressive.

18,KineticSeoul,"Well...It's better than ""Revenge of the Fallen""...",4,28 June 2014,"If your an audience member that actually liked ""Revenge of the Fallen"" you just might really enjoy this one. This movie is the epitome of a movie that is all about the visuals over substance, littered with superficial imageries. I think Michael Bay did put some amount of his time to listen to the fans when it came to having more robots fighting over human bull-crap. Because compared to the other installments, this probably has the most Transformers action. But there is no depth to any of the characters including the robots and the story. I just couldn't get emotionally invested in any of the situations. You can put up the most high budget action sequences, but without creativity or engrossing connections it all just falls flat. So I think Michael Bay was like ""Okay, you guys want more Transformers fighting, I will give you that...But you leave my damn explosions alone, that is my thing! That is what I do"". Maybe Michael Bay is trying to prove something...That he has enough resources to blow up the world. Because this movie in my opinion should be a record breaker for the most explosions in a movie ever. I think by making a montage of all the explosions in this movie with some classical music would be more amusing to watch, if that makes any sense. The standard Michael Bay humor isn't going to go away from his movies, but I didn't find it super awful. As a matter of fact if some of the humor was in a modern comedy these days, it be taken as alright. In the trailers it showed Dinobots, but they are hardly in this movie except for the final fight scene and for Optimus Prime to ride it. Yes, there is more Transformers action this time and if this movie came out in 2007 it would have been cool. But it's nothing all that new now and does get pretty darn tedious, instead of it amazing the audiences. In fact besides the few girls beside me the audiences in the theater just seem tired out, numb and unamused. Besides Mark Wahlberg and Stanley Tucci, none of the character really stood out and even they weren't that good of characters that stood out. There is the girl from ""The Last Airbender"" movie and her boyfriend in the movie that reminded me of a mix between Jason Stackhouse from ""True Blood"" and Chris Pratt. He just seemed like a pompous prick than someone you could root for. I was just constantly checking my time despite all the action sequences going on. It's all just a formulaic rehash of the previous installments in this franchise. The Michael Bay stereotypes also makes a return. With Optimus Prime's team composed of a stereotypical autobots...Who knows maybe it's to give the Transformers characteristics. ""Age of Extinction"" has 3 parts, not even scenes, but 3 or 4 parts that was kinda cool. However I don't think it's worth sitting almost 3 hours in the theaters for. Like the title, this Michael Bay franchise should go extinct. Two things that kept me going through this mess of a movie. Is the fact that it's at least better than ""Revenge of the Fallen"". And secondly the popcorn was good, it had the right amount of butter and salt. Which I ran out of in the two hour mark.4.5/10",Transformers - Age of Extinction
19,Hellmant,They're definitely not getting any better.,7,1 July 2014,"'TRANSFORMERS: AGE OF EXTINCTION': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The fourth installment in director Michael Bay's live-action adaptation of the popular Hasbro toy line, of the same name, about transforming robot aliens. It's a reboot to the series and has Mark Wahlberg taking over the lead human role (from Shia LaBeouf) as an inventor named Cade Yeager. He now aids the surviving Autobots in a battle against corrupt CIA agents and a robot alien bounty hunter (who's assisting them). Stanley Tucci, Kelsey Grammar, Nicola Peltz, Jack Reynor and T.J. Miller also join the new cast. Peter Cullen once again voices Optimus Prime and actors like John Goodman and Ken Watanabe join the voice cast. Bay directed the flick, Steven Spielberg executive produced it and Ehren Kruger returned to write the screenplay. I found the movie to be entertaining at first but then just exhausting (and mind numbing) as it kept going on and on.The story takes place four years after the Autobots and Decepticons battle in Chicago, of the last film, that left that city in ruins. A CIA unit, led by agent Harold Attinger (Grammer), has been tasked with hunting down the remaining Decepticons. Due to prejudice, and paranoia, Attinger (and his men) secretly hunt down and kill all of the remaining Transformers (including Autobots, who were US allies). Optimus Prime (Cullen) is hiding out in an old theater, wounded, when he's discovered by inventor Cade Yeager. Cade is hoping to find parts, for new inventions, so he can pay for his daughter, Tessa (Peltz), to go to college (and save his house from being sold). After discovering that the old truck he bought is a Transformer, Cade and Optimus team up; with the other remaining Autobots and Tessa's boyfriend Shane (Reynor). They must elude the CIA and an evil Transformer bounty hunter named Lockdown (Ryan). In the meantime a corporation called KSI is trying to use the remains of dead Transformers to build new ones. Joshua Joyce (Tucci) is the ambitious inventor who heads that company. The movie is a lot less coherent than it sounds; a lot of the time I had no idea what was going on (especially during action sequences). The visuals look great (much better than the earlier films) but the fight scenes just get more and more dull (and less involving) with each movie chapter. Seeing robots fight is always cool, at first, but when it stretches on and on, for nearly three hours of it, it gets really repetitive and boring. If this had been the first installment in the series it probably would have been more entertaining but after three other movies, just like it, the film does seem to be the worst of the bunch (although I hesitate to say it's worse than 'REVENGE OF THE FALLEN'). I also don't think Wahlberg is nearly as talented an actor, or as manically funny, as LaBeouf is (despite what type of people they might be in real life); so it's definitely lacking there as well. I don't hate these films, and I'll keep watching new installments, but they're definitely not getting any better.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diBy263FaHs",Transformers - Age of Extinction
20,thesar-2,I Wish Bay Was Extinct,1,22 January 2015,"Not since M. Night Shyamalan's The Happening has there been such an unintentionally hilarious and horribly constructed movie starring Mark Wahlberg. Perhaps M. Night should've directed this, as well. At least, I there would be more laughs to be had.In one of the most wretched series that began with one of my all-time least favorite films, it's hard for me to admit: Transformers: Age of Extinction might actually be worse than any of the previous three. Aside from this movie making me actually feel stupid and wishing I made a better choice with my life for the nearly three hours of torture I endured as some kind of sick, self-punishment, the movie had terrible dialogue, laughable characters, thoughtless acting, comical slow-mo, head-rolling toddler jokes, unintentionally hilarious shots, lazy special effects, inept direction, stupid human stories, an incoherent script that should put the writer on death row and the most atrocious editing I've ever seen in a movie.Other than the aforementioned main problems, it would take way longer than the horror this was to nitpick the hundreds of more things wrong with this. Suffice to say, this movie feels like everyone involved was either legally obligated to make a part four or they had guns pointed at their head to make this trash. One way or another, zero people put their heart into any of this.Plot synopsis: None. There is no plot. Fine. Chicago was destroyed in the boring last chapter, all alien Transformers are hunted and some Transformers want to kidnap others, some want to destroy and some want out. Much like us.Look, Transformers 1 killed my childhood. I grew up on Transformers and aside from the alien names and the movie's title, they changed practically every single other thing about my toys, cartoons and comic books I worshiped as a kid. Unbelievably, I have to actually rate this lower than that terrible first installment. Oh, in case you were wondering, parts 2 and 3 were 100% terrible as well, but this is people not even giving a sh|t anymore. Even the people behind all these Transformers movies just don't careabout improving the series or any sort of quality in movie-making. Okay, fine, that all said, you have to give it up to Bay: he's nothing but consistent. These movies go on for far too long and each with an hour climax that, by the time it shows up we're so uninterested and uninvested, the finale is just plain boring. I barely even pay any attention to all the carnage. In this film, however, it is rather amusing that one of the many, many villains, Galvatron, keeps asking all the other males to help him find his seed. Not sure if that was intentional, but still funny.Consider my warning: DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. It doesn't even fit in the ""so bad, it's good"" category. It fits in the ""two-hours, forty-five minutes you'll never get back"" league.* * *Final thoughts: Was Bay mocking America? Was there a reason every single American flag ever made was in this and shown at super-slo-mo as if that would make me forget I was watching one of the worst movies ever made that had nothing to do with protecting or serving U.S.A.? In a movie that's bent on stupidity-overkill, these excessive ""patriotic"" gestures had the reverse effect on me and made me feel this was more anti-American than pro. Shame on you Bay. Leave the country and never direct a movie again!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
21,FeastMode,sad face,4,1 July 2019,"The first time I watched this in IMAX had some very annoying circumstances that have to do with saving seats for moronic friends that show up 40 minutes late and getting in a fight with other people trying to take their spot in the middle of the movie. I was annoyed for half the movie.I liked and hated this movie. I liked most of the stuff to do with the transformers and I hated everything that had to do with the humans. EVERYTHING. The whole cast was terrible. lots of bad acting and horrible dialogue. and it was barely funny when it tried to be. made me realize how great Shia and John torturo were in the last 3.michael bay went a little overboard with pushing the limits of believability. lots of parts where you say there is no way they would ever survive something like that. some of the action scenes were phenomenal but some of them were a little confusing and hard to follow. a bunch of stuff in the movie seemed to try to mimic what they did in the third one. Definitely a lot of questionable parts but whatever. a lot of corny and cheesy parts...very late one night, i wanted to watch a movie but i knew i probably wouldn't be able to stay up for the whole thing. so i picked something fun that i didn't mind stopping halfway thru. and i was happy i chose this one. i looked forward to finishing it the next night.i keep coming back to this movie. the good parts are awesome. the great parts are amazing. goosebump-inducing. i watched most of the human parts on 1.6x speed. i should've just skipped em. i think you can edit this movie into something half-decent. and i would watch it again but skipping all of the human-only scenes.

22,Robert_duder,A film of this scale has too much good to be really bad and too much bad to be really good,6,6 July 2014,"I am truly surprised that fans seem to consider this a great turnaround for the series. Did they fix some of their mistakes they were making in the previous trilogy? YES! However, I couldn't help but feel this was Michael Bay's 200 million dollar flip off to his critics. I don't dislike Michael Bay. In fact, I think he's very talented. He has directed some of my favourite films. Bay has always paid great respect to the series and to fans that grew up with these characters. Seeing them in live action anytime is breath taking and this is no exception. This particular instalment has a lot of emotional scenes, some intensity and big explosions. The best thing they did was de-crowd the Transformers cast. By the third film (and especially the second one) there were so many Transformers you had no idea who was who and you were nearly lost there were so many of them. Finally they took it back to basics and give you a core group of them including favourites like Optimus Prime and Bumblebee. I thought they're stumbling block would be incorporating the dinobots that I always thought were a little gimmicky and cheesy but actually they were sparingly and well used despite a rather forced first appearance. I'll cover more of what I didn't like in my last paragraph.Getting rid of Shia Labeouf was a terrific idea! I have seen Mark Wahlberg in things I thought were amazing and things were he doesn't seem to fit into. This was sort of the latter. The character they created for him doesn't fit his persona and he seems awkward in it. He has enough chemistry on screen to always be watchable but the character did nothing for me as a human hero. They've always tended to make Hollywood stars appear younger than they are pairing mid-50's and 60's men with hot young starlets. Transformers: Age of Extinction goes in the opposite direction. They made Wahlberg the father of the hot young actress and it didn't work for me at all. Nicola Peltz is beautiful obviously and I only know her from Bate's Motel where I thought she was decent and she was okay in this and she certainly fit the Michael Bay quote of women but she failed to impress. Her chemistry with Wahlberg as his daughter was laughable. I would have rather seen them as romantic because it didn't work and the story arc between them was annoying, not touching. I just didn't buy it so it did nothing for me. Jack Reynor was actually really good as Peltz's boyfriend. Also he and Wahlberg are better together than anyone else so that helps. How can I say anything bad about Stanley Tucci? I can't. Tucci is an incredible character actor and he was quite good in this however his character completely changes mid-film which is fine and its such a drastic change that it ends up feeling awkward. Still Tucci is almost always good and I liked him as an anti-hero of sorts. The best in the cast for me was a surprise. Kelsey Grammar made a terrific villain! Easily the best in the cast. He wasn't campy or cheesy and he was appropriately evil. I only wanted to see more of him!! He made me excited to see him in August's Expendables 3. Titus Welliver was also excellent as the main evil henchman. He's always a good bad guy so he played it well and was a terrific adversary. The Wahlberg-Welliver fight stands out as being first rate though his death was reeeeally cheesy and yet from an 80's kid/80's action movie lover...I kind of liked it in all the wrong ways. Sophia Myles and Bingbing Li were okay in their roles as supporting characters and TJ Miller and James Bachman were both irritating and unnecessary in the ""comedy"" ""Buddy"" roles. The entire Transformers voice cast were first rate of course and John Goodman being added as Hound was awesome.Clearly they had a lot of ideas for this fourth film. There is no way in any Universe a Transformers film should be three hours long. It felt three hours too. The storyline is decent and mostly it feels like a prologue to the original trilogy. I understand that it seems they are trying to pay homage to the more recent iterations of Transformers and good for them! The new generation will likely love it though there was a fair bit of bad language that was completely unnecessary. I was also annoyed at the direction they turned with the personality of Bumblebee. Yes he's supposed to be the young hot headed one but he lacked the same personality we've all come to know and love. The humour in the film was very off balanced. The jokes felt forced and it just felt like it was trying to be dark and then funny and it didn't mesh well. Overall, this film felt like everyone who hates Michael Bay would expect. A lot of flash and bang with very little depth. He has done flash and bang with great story and characters that you root for and this just felt sort of meandering and surface fun. The first film was just amazing and it has fallen so much. Maybe the fun factor for me has worn off but it was too long, too underdeveloped character wise, too scattered and just missed so many marks for me. But I still had fun mostly and I'm not sorry I saw it. The 3D was pointless (in my opinion 99.9% of the time it almost always is) and outside of one scene where ashes were floating in the air, there was ZERO need for 3D. However, they uncomplicated it, stripped it back to basics and it was okay. The series is definitely on a decline sadly and rebooting it didn't serve to change that. 6/10",Transformers - Age of Extinction

The fourth in a franchise showing no signs of slowing, though relegated to spin-offs it may now be. The picture is just about serviceable in the sense that it didn't anger me, but it is also just plain bland and instantly forgettable.

24,ThomasDrufke,Age Of ExSTOINCKtion,4,1 July 2014,"After liking 2 of the first 3 movies in the Transformers series I thought there was a possibility of adding another entertaining film to the franchise. The result is a mess of a movie with some of the worst acting seen on screen. This is essentially the same movie as the other 3. Incapable humans somehow are capable to fight alongside Autobots to defeat other Transformers. Not only is it the same plot, it is 165 minutes long. There is absolutely no reason for a movie like this to be that long. What doesn't help is the film's big reveal is not hidden at all. In fact they basically reveal it within the first hour. I didn't expect much, but I got worse.There are perhaps a few redeemable qualities left though. The action and CGI effects are once again eye popping. But by the time you get to the final act you are fatigued by the overwhelming amount of explosions. Michael Bay made the exact same movie with the exact same stereotypes, exposure of women, and Hollywood clichés. Does he still believe he is making a good film? Props to Mark Wahlberg, who for some odd reason signed onto to star in this film, and turned out to be the only actor who I could bear to watch. Stanley Tucci and Kelsey Grammar were over-the-top and obnoxious. I found myself face-palming at least 15 times throughout the film. Sure Nicola Peltz is beautiful but in no way did she show any promise in the acting field. And I cant tell you how many terrible acting moments Jack Reynor had.I feel bad for anyone who had to pay for this 3 hour train wreck. If your someone (like me) who actually goes to the movies to watch real cinema, then this movie isn't for you. If your someone who wants to watch the same exact film as the other 3 and pay 10 dollars, then be my guest.+Mark Wahlberg +Effects are breathless at times..-..Too bad it becomes exhausting -The acting is some of the worst I've ever seen -Story is exactly the same, just more explosions -No surprises -Nearly 3 hours long?? 4.4/10",Transformers - Age of Extinction
25,g-bodyl,You Get What You See!,7,4 June 2015,"Transformers: Age of Extinction is the fourth movie in the Michael Bay-fronted franchise starring the Autobots and Decepticons. This movie promises explosions and countless CGI action scenes, and the movie delivers on its promise. That being said, I felt this was the weakest film in the franchise. I enjoyed the action and the addition of Mark Wahlberg, but the cheesy lines and hammy story is more noticeable than ever. I didn't think the jokes worked as well this time around. As for the Transformers, we get some awesome creature designs and I really liked the dino Transformers.Michael Bay's film takes place several years after Chicago was destroyed during the battle between the Autobots and Decepticons. Now the government feels that all alien robots are dangerous, so they hire this bounty hunter robot to track down and destroy the Autobots. It's up to an inventor named Cade Yeager and his daughter, Tessa along with Optimus Prime to save what's left of the remaining Autobots.As for acting, there are some good and bad moments. Mark Wahlberg is a solid actor and he does a good job here despite some cringing dialogue. Stanley Tucci did a great job as one of the scientists working for the government. Nicola Peltz does a good job as Wahlberg's daughter, a big improvement over her performance in 2010's The Last Airbender. Jack Reynor does a decent job as her boyfriend. On the flip side, Kelsey Grammar, who is normally a solid actor, makes a rather poor villain. He certainly did not seem scary whatsoever.Overall, Transformers 4 is a movie that showers you will explosions and action, which is mostly effective. But at such a long length, it does turn into a possible overkill. I enjoyed the movie for what it is, but there is no denying that this is the weakest film in the franchise and maybe it may be time to call it quits, despite being a giant money-maker for Paramount. Action is good, but story is borderline dreadful.My Grade: C",Transformers - Age of Extinction
26,lesleyharris30,"Puts the Franchise on a New Road,Action Packed and More Fun than Previous Instalments,",8,11 January 2015,"Transformers: Age of Extinction is a great movie with a well developed storyline and a terrific cast.I know that many,many people are going to disagree with me here,but I am happy this franchise is still going and am happy with the changes that were made in this,at first I wasn't impressed with it continuing without Shia LaBeouf,but after all the controversy surrounding him in the last year,and the fact that Dark of the Moon was a complete mess,I thought these changes were necessary and Mark Wahlberg is much better suited for the action hero role.I still think the first Transformers is the finest in the series,but in think this tops Revenge of the Fallen and Dark of the Moon by far,I found myself caring for these characters much more than anyone in the previous two,and the cast was simply more talented,with great performances from people such as Wahlberg,Keksey Grammar and Stanley Tucci.There are definitely some very ridiculous aspects to this movie,such as the Dinobots,but I can look past these things and I don't try to look at this franchise as being anymore than what it is,a fun Michael Bay movie based on an animated series,he's an underrated director who definitely knows what he's doing.It is certainly longer than it needs to be,but it's a fun and action packed ride, and I would recommend Transformers: Age of Extinction to anyone looking for a good action or adventure,and fans of the previous movies that don't try to overlook it,should be impressed.

Cade (Wahlberg) is a single father who is struggling to make ends meet and save money for his daughter to go to college. He spends his days inventing random things but has never had any luck. When he buys a semi truck in order to fix it and make money he gets more than he expected. After working with it the truck comes alive and he realizes he has found Optimus Prime. When the government finds out they pay him a visit but Cade isn't interested in giving what he has found to them. To me the only reason for a sequel to a movie is if you have something different to add or a different aspect of a story to tell. Most sequels seem to be done because ""the first one made a lot of money so we should do another one now."" 9 times out of 10 the sequel ends of ruining everything that was good about the previous one because they try to do the same thing but change just enough to make it worse. This one is the opposite. This one has good robots vs bad robots with the government deciding the good ones are the bad guys. It has someone accidentally finding Optimus Prime and instantly becoming friends with him and helping Prime to save the other Transformers and eventually the city. This one has a sexy young woman who really does nothing more then look pretty and yell a lot. It has the government thinking Transformers aren't needed anymore and refuses to help at all. Optimus Prime nearly dies a few times but is rescued at the perfect time by one of the humans. The bad robots are convinced that Prime is too nice to the humans and don't understand why he won't harm them. See what I mean...totally original and nothing like the others at all. I remember when this movie was announced people were saying how this wasn't needed and Michael Bay needed to stop making these. His response was ""let them say what they want. They will still pay to see it."" That line right there sums up everything that is wrong with movies like this. He is 100% accurate (I watched it for free in order to do this review otherwise I would have skipped it). As long as these movies make billions of dollars at the box office they will keep getting made over and over until finally they hit a Batman and Robin stage. Then the unnecessary reboot will happen. Now that that is out of my system...as far as this specific movie goes...it was so slow moving and boring that the nearly 3 hour run time seemed about 3 hours too long. The only thing different in these movies compared to the other ones is the cast is different. I could keep going but I will end with saying...overall, yet another unnecessary sequel that does nothing to help the franchise. Boring, unexciting and a real struggle to get through.

To make it worst, the government is teaming up with a metal industry leaded by inventor Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci) to make upgrade Transformer such as Galvatron (voiced by Frank Welker) to hunt down the rest of the Autobots as well. Can Optimus Prime and others survive this onslaught? Watch it to find out! I have to say, at less, this movie wasn't so bad, as the others. Let's roll out, and see the reasons why it is. First off, the acting is somewhat better. You really got some really good actors, here, with the new human cast. Yes, there is no cameos or mentions of the previous cast with this. While, I'm kinda disappointed that they didn't mention them. I was kinda glad, the new cast work, way better. Mark Walberg indeed looks and acts like a leading man. The stunt work, he did was pretty damn impressing. While, he did get feed some really stupid lines, for the most part, he wasn't annoying. Most of the supporting human characters weren't that bad; if they were, they were quickly kill off, or didn't hang around much. The only odd stereotype were the Asians, who Michael Bay had to portray as Kung Fu Masters. Tessa, Cade's daughter was indeed fan service made to be hot, damsel in distress, but she wasn't as badly exploited, just for her sex appeal like Fox or Whiteley. The new transformers that appear, were just as bad in cartoony racial stereotypes as 2009's Revenge of the Fallen. They weren't really introduce in the film that well. They came out of nowhere. Honestly, where did they come from? Wasn't the pillars and Cybertron destroy from the last movie? Wasn't the All Spark destroy in the previous films? It makes little sense, as the film lacks exposition of where these characters come from. Some of their scenes were a bit too cheesy. Still, you got great actors, playing them like John Goodman as Hounds & Ken Watanabe as Drift. Also, what the hell; the Dinobots show up out of nowhere and appear way too late in the film with little to no mention of them. Are we to believe, they been stuck on that ship for years? How come, they weren't used during the Cretaceous Period apocalypse opening scene? It seem like a lost-chance of making the film have any logic, there. You can have them, protecting the weapon, 'the seed'. Instead, Grimlock and Dinobots been demote to near mindless pets, now. It's the original characters that are got so annoying. Bumblebee for getting so angry that he endanger his comrades during a spy mission. Dude, Bumblebee, you been in so many missions, and you still can't keep it to together. Then there is Brains (voiced by Reno Wilson) with the stupid jive talk exposition style. The 3D visual effects here, are not as impressing as Dark Side of the Moon; but it was cool, watching the action scenes even if they do cheesy slow motion, and annoying quick cuts. I give you some really bad example of stupid scenes. The whole car chase with ramps jumps with driver, Shane Dyson (Jack Reynor) was so unrealistic, it hurts to watch. Another, had to be the scene where Crosshairs (Voiced by John DiMaggio) paragliding in slow motion shooting in a Guns Akimbo pose. Gees, that was awful. They get me on the robots dancing skills. At less, visuals, now you can tell the different between the Autobots and the new Decepticons. I do have to say, Lockdown is pretty badass, and voice acting works with that feel, even if he's sounds like a Pirate. I do have to say, the movie has a really awful pacing. There are really a lot of slow moments in this film for a nearly 3 hour film. Thank God, there isn't a lot of silly jokes and awful music choices, but still have something in depth that make us want to tune in. It got really hard to sit through after a while. It could had been cut down, just a little bit. 140 to 150 mins is alright, but 165 minutes is too damn long for a film like this. It's the longest run time in the Transformer franchise to dated. The ending of the film seem rush as hell, and just add more to the confusing moments of the film. Overall: If you like the original 1980s cartoon, the new plot and films will kill them. If you're a fan of the new movies, this is probably the best in the series. It's watchable for the most part.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
32,The-Sarkologist,More robots beating each other up.,6,5 July 2014,"It seems that once again we have a film about a bunch of giant robots that can turn themselves into things (usually sports cars) beating up on a bunch of other giant robots who can also turn into things (usually sports cars). So, what is the difference from the other three movies that are pretty much about the same thing. Well, maybe there is the story, and maybe there is the actors (Shia Labouf has been replaced with Mark Whalberg), or maybe there is the setting. Even then, these things are like thin layers of paint that cover a wall that is no different to the other wall that the other thin layers of paint cover.This does not necessarily mean that it is a bad movie. Well, if you like big robots beating up big robots with some vague concept known as a plot stringing these fight scenes together, then I guess you will probably like this movie. The acting is, well, what you would expect to come from a movie about robots beating each other up. Ditto with the character development (though we do have somebody switch sides in the movie). The cinematography is good, but I doubt you wouldn't expect any less coming from a Michael Bay movie.The one thing that caught me about this movie though would have to be the setting. Having been to Hong Kong this film once again reminded me that film makers are very liberal with their depiction of a city. For instance, when the robots get into a fight and are thrown over the other side of Victoria Peak, they suddenly land up in a huge jungle canyon, a canyon that I don't remember falling into when I went over to the other side of Victoria Peak. Also, they seem to jump around around the city a lot (one time they are at Quarry Bay, then thy are at the Convention Centre, then Central, and even at one point – or more – they were on the other side of the harbour). I am sure that if I had not been to Hong Kong it would have not phased me one bit (though I may have ended up running around looking for a non-existent mono-rail, or wondered if the Transfomers ended up destroying the non-existent bridge across Victoria Harbour). Still, it did not detract all that much from the movie, other than giving me some rip roaring bellyaches.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

34,Reno-Rangan,Getting upgraded. Marginally a reboot. Bit fresh and Entertaining.,9,27 June 2014,"I have never been so excited to see a Transformers movie since the first one. Yeah, last time I missed, but this time it was in digital 3D. I was booked for the best seat in the cinema hall. I prefer watching movie opening day (night) itself because to avoid mix up with others opinion. I watch and I give my stance. Which makes my belief's unchangeable, if the opposite viewpoint to mine start to pour.Seen many 3D movies and this was one of the mind blowing one. I was very much satisfied with the graphics and sound mixing. I just wanted to remind you that I often play the opening 20 seconds of 'Dark of the Moon'. You know why, because I love that awesome metallic sound to hear it in surround speakers. This was the 2 hours and 45 minute long movie, the runtime was never been an issue to me. I would have loved it if another 10 minutes of the stunts were added. Lots of new Autobots were introduced like the one you saw in the trailers, the Dinobots. Even all the stunts and transformation of Autobots from automobiles were shown from far enough distance to enjoy with pleasure. The graphic movie geeks will love whole movie like it made specially for them.''After all we have done, humans are hunting us. But I fear we are all targets now.''It is partially a reboot movie. Someone just won't disappear into the thin air. They did not bother to clarify what happened to the original actors Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox. I think we must assume that they will be back in the next and I don't think it is such a good idea. But still we need a proper explanation. Okay, this movie refreshed the franchise after lots of criticism in the last film. That's fine so the next film should take the responsibility on that matter. This is the only thing that worries the one who followed all the transformers movies. Other than that, there are minor flaws that are not big trouble maker once the entertainment began.I don't know why there was so much hate on Michael Bay. Critics thinks they are the deciders who can change the fortune of a movie throwing it up between flop and success, but they are not. I really feel sorry for the audience who fall for those cheap tricks. Remember, critics are a bunch of sheep who follow one another till everyone fall into a deep hole, they may grab you along so be careful. The critic should change their profession or retire, because in the hundred years of film history, they were the obstacle for the filmmakers. Take advice from movie geeks if you needed one or take chances by yourself. That's what I gonna say you all.Lots of refreshment in this fourth installment. The first one was the cast, I am very happy to bring all new faces here. I mean humans, not Autobots, as we know without or replace of Optimus Prime would not work. But we can see little bit upgrades in everything, including the technical side of the movie making as well as in the story. You are not only brought to the cinema hall to enjoy the giant robot like creature fight themselves, there were plenty of human side drama, sentiments and all the above the stunts.It's really, really a grand idea to put Mark Wahlberg in the first place to this franchise. I can't praise that he saved this movie series in this part, but his presence made vast differences compared to the earlier three movies. In other side the humours were so good, it did play the part to put the movie on the right course. I still remember those funny lines from the movie and laugh. Especially, there is one I could not get rid off from my mind that follow like this: Swettie, get my alien gun. Hahaha. I know it was intense, but perfectly utilised in the perfect situation.This time the grand finale was not in the US of America or Egypt or Arctic and Antartic, but was in China. Some of stunt sequences shot with the humans were greatly done on the edges of an old apartment building. Watching those in 3D gave me a thrilling experience. I also liked the songs that came when the stunts were in progress. The track was called 'Battle Cry' by Imagine Dragons, an awesome composition.Like everyone categorize each installment with different ratings, I can't do that. I like all the before three movies equally with only the fractions of difference. The first two were so much fancied up and glamorized with the presence of Megan Fox. The third one was what tried to be more honest, but the cast does not look like blend well. That is where this the fourth movie made all the modifications and it worked. If this movie fails, then not because of the bad execution from the cast and crew, though the foul mouth critics to blame.Anyway business wise it will do well all over the globe except the rating which will sink. This story ended with a strong line said by the great leader, Optimus Prime. That created more curious about the fifth movie. Hope the pre production begins very soon. In between that if you have not seen it yet, go for it. It is not a suggestion, but making you realise it was not bad like you have heard.8.5/10",Transformers - Age of Extinction
35,paulclaassen,Stunning visuals and action sequences.,6,5 June 2019,"The film has a new cast and I must admit I really enjoyed the characters. They have more depth and I cared more about them. It also did not have the annoying romance interest set-up that was present in the previous films. Mark Wahlberg makes a credible hero and breathes new life in the franchise. Stanley Tucci stars as billionaire Joshua Joyce, an engineer who now builds his own Transformers. He is such a great actor and I enjoyed him in this installment.The visuals and action scenes are once again spectacular. The photography is the best in the series so far. The cinematography is also outstanding. This was INCREDIBLE!! For a film almost 3 hours long, this fast-paced action fantasy thriller was never boring. I must be honest, I did find the first half better, as the second part becomes incredibly CGI-heavy. It was nevertheless still entertaining and amazingly well done. We're also introduced to a few new Transformers.The only thing that really annoyed me, was the American flag. I mean, it was just everywhere and always in frame! Michael Bay is oh-so-patriotic. That was just too much...",Transformers - Age of Extinction
36,briancham1994,Waste of time,3,5 August 2020,"What a load of garbage. This film is a complete mess with incomprehensible CGI battles, shaky action, no storyline and completely unlikeable characters. At least the original trilogy had a stuttering buffoon we could follow as an audience surrogate. There are no redeeming features in this film and no reason to watch it.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
37,tomgillespie2002,Bay fills his pockets again with a complete lack of artistic integrity,4,16 October 2014,"For those (surely) few concerned at the film title's hint that this may spell the end of the giant, indistinguishable CGI aliens, then rest assured, the perplexing box-office takings and the recent announcement of a fifth instalment means that there's no end in sight for Michael Bay's soulless, money-churning franchise. For those tired of the sickly, shaky-cam photography, annoying, goofy humour, tactless pandering to it's undemanding audience, and endless scenes of computer effects bashing against one another, this spells disaster. Though Age of Extinction marks a slightly more focused improvement over it's two predecessors, Bay is showing no signs of wanting to create a decent movie.ssentially a re-boot due to a complete cast overhaul (minus the robots), this fourth instalment offers little in terms of refreshment. Our human hero is now Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg), replacing Shia LaBeouf's Sam Witwicky, but sharing all the personality traits. Yeager is a genius mechanic, turning junk into something useful, though nothing financially successful, as his hot- pants-donning jailbait daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) repeatedly points out. He is essentially the same nerdy, fast-talking every-man as Sam, only he has arms like tree trunks. His discovery of a beaten-down old trunk in a crumbling movie theatre (perhaps a nod to Bay's hand in the disappearance of the local independent cinema) kicks off a series of events which soon attract the attention of corporate-type CIA agent Attinger (Kelsey Grammar).Of course, the truck is Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen), and it turns out that the government are hunting down transformers - even the good guys who helped in the previous film's battle in Chicago. A shady company, headed by Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci - the only actor appearing to have a pulse), is also involved, using 'science' to extract data from the head of Megatron and extracting a new, codeable metal - laughably dubbed 'Transformium'. Anything can be created from the substance, and is being used to develop the company's very own transformers, including Galvatron, who fans of the comic will know to be an absolute beast. When he is unleashed, it becomes apparent that Galvatron has plans of his own. Also in the mix is ancient transformer bounty hunter Lockdown (Mary Ryan), who intends on taking Optimus back to the 'creator'.It's a hell of a lot of plot, and at 165 minutes, this will test the endurance of even the most hard-core fan of the new movie franchise. Bay clearly hasn't learned anything from the critics. Age of Extinction is the same convoluted splurge as the film's that came before. This time at least, thanks to the vocal talents of John Goodman and Ken Watanabe, the robots can at least be identified amidst the carnage. Without Megan Fox or Rosie Huntington-Whitely to letch over, Bay has employed another useless female character in Peltz, who runs away from explosions in short-shorts and high heels, and has an equally dull boyfriend in Shane (Jack Reynor - whose Irish accent somehow sounds fake even though his IMDb page lists him as having lived in Ireland most of his life). They've been sleeping together for ages so, y'know, the whole sex with a minor thing is cool.Many critics have dubbed this as the worst yet, but I disagree. Although I detest the use of CGI as a narrative tool, the special effects here are some of the greatest work ever put on film. There's also no outright racist characters, such as the Twins from Revenge of the Fallen (2009), and the whole experience is far less cringe- worthy than it's predecessor's in terms of attempted comedy. But with the film failing to inject any development or evolution into the series, the point of these movies points to just one thing - money. Bay is filling his pockets without a shred of artistic integrity, and as long as audiences keep offering their money for sheer mediocrity, these movies will keep popping up every couple of years.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
38,Thanos_Alfie,Above average...,6,3 August 2020,"""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" is an Action - Sci-Fi movie and the fourth movie of the ""Transformers"" franchise, in which we watch Optimus Prime being hunted by a bounty hunter and a mechanic with his family along with the Autobots trying to help him.I consider ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" as another average Sci-Fi movie that had a simple but interesting plot, some good interpretations and an average direction made by Michael Bay. It's not a bad movie but it should be far better than this and as in the previous movie I believe that it did not reach its true potential. Since I had already watched all the previous movies I was expecting something equally good with the first movie which surprised me and it reached the potential of ""Transformers"". Unfortunately that did not happen with this movie and I do not believe that will happen again.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
39,zkonedog,Not Nearly As Fun As The Original Trilogy,3,4 March 2017,"As long as human beings enjoy grabbing a large bucket of popcorn, a soft drink, and settling into their theater seat, there will be a market for ""Transformers"" movies, as they are the very essence of escapist cinema. What the original ""Transformers"" trilogy had going for it, though, was the fact that is was also just so much doggone fun! I am often viewed as a somewhat pretentious movie-watcher (liking films that make me think/feel), yet I liked all three previous films in this series while friends who were much more casual viewers fell away. I guess I just liked how much FUN it was to kick back and watch them! With ""Age of Extinction"", however, the serious tone throughout completely destroys any opportunity for fun. This is all robotics and family issues and government corruption. No time for levity whatsoever.For a basic plot summary (some spoilers), ""Age of Extinction"" sees inventor (junk dealer?) Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) and his daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) find the long-lost Optimus Prime after the Chicago Wars of previous films. By this time, a shadow sect inside the government (led by Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammar)) has partnered with a robotics company/laboratory (led by Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci)) in order to create Transformers...thus rendering Optimus and his original crew obsolete and thus expendable. Predictably, the plan goes haywire and a giant battle ensues...this time featuring Dino-Bots!There are two main issues with this movie that made it a disappointing experience for me:1. I still found myself marveling at some of the robot battle scenes, but this time there is no levity whatsoever. A two-and-a-half hour film cannot be whirling robot parts and explosions 24/7 (despite director Michael Bay's probable contrary views!). There needs to be some down time for character development and humor to create a balance. This film had no of that. Whereas the interplay between Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox was so dead-on and relatable to its target audience, this one is stereotyped and about as cardboard as a script can get. The characters never develop, the humor is forced a large portion of the time, and thus this movie is utterly vacant beyond the Transformers themselves.Also on this note, I think that LaBeouf's absence is the biggest downfall. Say what you want (and one could say plenty) about LaBeouf's personal life these days, but in my mind he MADE the ""Transformers"" franchise. Without his hyper-kinetic energy, many scenes just fall flat.2. This movie is WAAAAAAAAY too long. Chop off the last 45 minutes, and I'd probably bump it up a whole star rating. The last segment, though, is just about as bloated and un-inspiring as a film ending can get. I actually began wishing that the movie would just end, but instead was ""treated"" to battle after battle seemingly without end. As I said earlier, had earlier portions of the film balanced things out a bit better, maybe this type of ending wouldn't have seemed so over- the-top. As it was, though, it just dragged on, and on, and on.Overall, I have a hard time believing that Steven Spielberg's name is still attached to this iteration of the franchise. He doesn't get involved with too many stinkers, but this is one of them. I can't guarantee that I won't view the inevitable next movie in the franchise, but I can with 100% certainty say this: I will likely never again be ""really, really excited"" to see a ""Transformers"" flick. That ship (sadly) has now sailed.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
40,Floated2,Intense Action but poorly scripted plot,3,10 October 2015,"The Transformers sequels have made money, but they were disproportionate. In ultimately panning the film, one observed that the film lapsed into outright parody as it became ever more unhinged. The same can be said of this follow-up, but in Age of Extinction it is more fun with a game cast led by Mark Wahlberg.The film starts up years after the battle in Chicago from the last film. Cade Yeager (Wahlberg) is a struggling inventor and single father. One day while purchasing some old junk, he happens upon a war-wounded semi-truck that's hidden in a decaying movie theater. He has yet to know that the rusting damaged vehicle is actually Optimus Prime. Meanwhile, after the tragic events in Chicago, a secretive government organization has been hunting Transformers to make the world safer. The idea is that the alien invaders should be eliminated. And that means both the Decepticons and the Autobots have to go.

41,eddie_baggins,Transformers - just the way you'd expect and want it to be,6,29 June 2014,"Disclaimer - this review is for the 2-D version of the film.With 3 films well and truly done and dusted and with this 4th entry now upon us, there is no question that by now you should know what you're in for when it comes to a Transformers movie and you should know whether your amped for the next bout of robot metal carnage or ready to run for the high hills because for better or worse Bayham is back just the way in which we expected.There is no hiding from the truth – Transformers is frothier than an ice cold Bud Light, as shiny as a new pair of Gucci glasses, louder than the newest Beats headset, more hyperactive than a child on a can of Red Bull and more stylised than an Armani suit model (did I miss any product placements here people? I would hate to miss out on those commissions!) but that's exactly why people are paying to see these films by the billions, it's escapist entertainment at its most throwaway and turn your brain off enjoyable.Michael Bay has never made any pretensions to being anything more than a deliverer of action at its most bombastic and car destroying focused and there is an argument I'd be willing to enter into that at the present time there is no director of action in the business better than Bay. Scenes within all of his Transformers movies have been at times ludicrously eye popping and again here there are certain set pieces that would make most popcorn masters cry with jealousy. When the action ramps up in the films 4 or so anchoring parlays each frame sizzles with glossy effects, a heck of a lot of fire and destruction and a sense of visual wonderment that far outweighs many of the films huge plot holes or Victoria Secret model thin story. It's refreshing in some strange way that Bay soaks in the essence of these entertainment pieces and shuns all over the top actors at his disposal and just charges ahead with what he does well regardless.Talking about anything else in Transformers is a pointless exercise because if it isn't blowing up or punching each other in the metal face it's just not really achieving anything. In some strange way though it's sad that from the first entry into the franchise until now a charm has certainly been lost in amongst all the extravaganza of fast cars and robot dinosaurs. The first Transformers movie was an absolute joyous Blockbuster affair with wit, action and a robot infused heart that was trampled on by the 2nd entry, forgotten about in the 3rd and an afterthought in this new entry and in saying that a 5th movie in the series doesn't seem overly intriguing.Naysayers can nay say and converts can rejoice – Transformers does as Transformers does and Bay is having a blast every minute of his far too long running time. Age of Extinction may have Marky Mark as its lead and a fresh new blonde to ogle but there not worth the price of admission or a second mention as here it's all about the big budget carnage and on that front the postman certainly delivers.3 face warrants out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",Transformers - Age of Extinction
42,leonblackwood,Wasn't as bad as I thought it would be! 7/10,7,22 November 2014,"Review: Epic! Epic! Epic! This was one extremely epic movie with brilliant graphics and a decent storyline. I much preferred Wahlberg in the lead than LaBeouf but his child looked more like his girlfriend than his daughter. Anyway, you can definitely see were the whole budget went because the movie is full of impressive action which had excellent attention to detail. It does take some time to get going because the director wanted to give the new characters some depth, so I can't blame him for that. The problem that I had with some or the earlier movies in this franchise was that the fighting scenes were quite confusing because there was so just going on, but in this movie the director cleared up the action scenes which made it easier to watch. I was a bit sceptical when I saw the length of the film but it really doesn't seem that long when your watching it. Anyway, it's definitely one to watch and I'm kicking myself for not watching it on the big screen. Enjoyable!Round-Up: After reading some of the reviews for this movie, I really wasn't expecting that much but I can't see why people are complaining about the wit and the length. Personally I liked the added wit throughout the movie but it could have done without his daughter and the pointless boyfriend who was only good behind the wheel. On the downside, it does get a bit manic when they go to Hong Kong and the storyline does start to get a bit crazy, but the action scenes save the day. I wasn't a big fan of the previous movies, except for the first one, but this has to be the second best in the franchise. With such a massive profit made, I'm sure we're going to see more from the Transformers, even though some people really didn't like this one.Budget: $210million Worldwide Gross: $1Billion (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who are into the Transformers franchise and want to see a movie full of action with the usual robots and ""save the world"" concept. 7/10",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Dumb.,2,6 July 2014,"Bay has a strong, distinct style: big, obnoxious, loud, incoherent, and mind numbing, with a propensity to shoot from the ground up like what he's doing really matters. T:AOE is relentlessly bludgeoning in all these ways. It's a clock watcher with about 70 minutes of actual things happening, and 95 minutes of slow motion, unpleasant jokes, emotionless posturing, boring set pieces and a whole heck of a lot of running. It's shiny, overlong, and just plain dumb. The plot isn't worth wasting precious word count on. Like written by a focus group of dirty, middle aged, American men, it's forgettable, thoughtless, and even sexist. The motivations of the characters are senseless, and the action lacks any surprise or coherence. The themes of warfare weaponry are reduced to dissatisfying, cheesy one-liners. Even the inherent coolness in robots fighting dinosaurs is handled squarely, Optimus Prime childishly pontificating on justice and humanity. Most disappointing is the strength and subsequent waste of acting talent. The abilities of Tucci, Goodman, Grammar, and Wahlberg are squandered on bad character clichés. The fast-driving boyfriend, the over-protective and immature dad, the dead mom, the misunderstood daughter, the dopey friend With a movie this long, we deserve people to care about, not just tolerate. Maybe the effects are pretty good, and some of the comedians (Miller, Lennon) breathe some life. Otherwise, T:AOE is fairly worthless. It thoughtlessly and forcefully enters your brain and then mercifully leaves it before you throw away your popcorn.

46,Vartiainen,When will it end?,1,2 August 2014,"These films are like narcotics. They're so bad for you, but as you sit there watching, you get strangely complacent about their bad qualities. You get pulled into the explosions, the gadgetry, the action scenes, the obnoxious cheesiness of it. Only later do you realize that you're basically causing the tumour to grow larger and filthier with the hard-earned coin you're sacrificing to feed Michael Bay.Sure, it's a great-looking film. The special effects are topnotch, the action scenes feel suitably heavy and there are multitude of them. The budget shows, that's for certain. Furthermore, Mark Wahlberg, as bland and boring as his character is, still remains a definite improvement over Shia LaBeouf.It's the everything else that doesn't even attempt to hide the fact that it's scraping the very bottom of the barrel. The story is the exact same as it has always been. Superficial skin changes have been made to fool the feeble-minded, but it's the exact same story of some big bad corporation guy working for Decepticons, which are in turn fought by the Autobots aided by some random schmuck.What's worse, even the action is starting to become repetitive. There are certain slow motion scenes that are exact ripoffs from the previous films. The score is still entirely forgettable, the characters are cardboard cutouts, the plot makes little sense whatsoever and even the intrinsic coolness of battle robots duking it out is not as exciting as it was three movies ago. No, not even the dino robots.I regret seeing this film. I regret allowing Michael Bay to continue making these films. I was weak, my friends were going as well, but that's no excuse. I have to stop this, and I urge you to do the same.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
47,DarkVulcan29,Enjoyed it for what it was worth.,8,29 June 2014,"This latest installment to the Transformers film is pretty entertaining, like the others except for Revenge of The Fallen(2009), I liked cause there guilty pleasures nothing more. It easy totake shots at director Michael Bay, but he gets the last laugh, cause he is making millions off this.The effects are just as good, the battle scenes between the transformers is quite impressive. The Transformers are all has memorable has the human characters. Mark Wahlberg brings a lot of touches here has an inventor who finds a broken down Optumus Prime. Stanley Tucci is pretty funny has an over the top billionaire. This movie is entertaining, nothing more.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
48,freemantle_uk,There were improvements to the franchise,5,14 September 2020,"Age of Extinction holds a dismal 18% on Rotten Tomatoes and 5.6 on IMDB and whilst there are better blockbusters out there these scores are a bit harsh. Most criticisms focus on the subplot between Shane and Tessa (i.e. the Romeo and Juliet law scene), the catering to the Chinese market, and the product placement. These weren't unwarranted but there were some improvements, like reducing the number of Autobots down to five and giving them some characteristics. I would be lying if a scene where Optimus Prime fights a robot dinosaur appeals to my inner 10-year-old. I personally think the bulk of the plot where Transformers are getting hunted and an company experiments on them would have fitted better as the first sequel.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
49,stevendbeard,Great Effects But Miniscule Storyline,7,27 June 2014,"I saw ""Transformers:Age of Extinction"", starring Mark Wahlberg-Ted, The Perfect Storm; Stanley Tucci-The Hunger Games movies, Easy A; Kelsey Grammar-Think Like a Man Too, X-Men:The Last Stand and Nicola Peltz- Bates Motel_t.v., The Last Airbender.This is the fourth in the Transformer series of movies; the first one was in 2007, the second one was Revenge of the Fallen in 2009 and the third was Dark of the Moon in 2011. All were directed by Michael Bay, including this new one. The biggest change is in the actors that play humans. Mark replaces Shia LaBeouf as the main human with connections to the Transformers. This film takes place about 4 years after Dark of the Moon ended. Mark is a single dad to Nicola and is a mechanic and part time inventor just trying to pay his bills. He finds and repairs Optimus Prime. Kelsey plays a C.I.A. executive leading a black ops team that is hunting down and exterminating all of the remaining autobots that have went into hiding since the Chicago battle-Kelsey just plain hates aliens. Stanley plays a billionaire inventor that is working on building his own man-made Transformers that he can control. There is also a side story about an alien Transformer that is a bounty hunter in pursuit of Optimus Prime that could be expanded more in the next movie-and yes, I'm sure that there will be a next movie. There are lots of fantastic looking battles-I saw it in IMAX 3D-but the story line could have been fleshed out a little more. It's a long movie, at 2 1/2 hours, but it just seemed like it was one fight after another, with very little story line to make sense of why they were fighting. Oh yeah, another new addition is the dinosaur Transformers. I also recognized John Goodman's voice as one of the good Transformers-I don't remember his name but he was usually seen smoking a robot version of a cigar. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, language and smoking and has a running time of 2 hours & 45 minutes. As I said, this movie won't win any academy awards in the acting department but it is a good action flick-and that is why I go to these types of films-and I would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
50,XweAponX,A total reconstruction of the franchise,10,15 April 2020,"As I predicted in my review of dark of the moon.In fact I was surprised when this movie came out. The Sam Whitwicky story didn't really have anywhere else to go, and all of the other government ""agencies"" and other aspects of this universe had crashed and burned. So there was literally no one left to rebuild the franchise, other than the autobots themselves.And of course all of the autobots get a downgrade, then, and upgrade, including Optimus prime.Also this film is peppered with great character actors like Stanley Tucci, as well as a lot of new fresh faces.What is extremely interesting about this film is that they used a lot of real life robots that actually function...This film brings the Autobot universe to its lowest Nadir and then back up to its peak, while also delivering a lot of Autobot history. Were the Transformers born or were they made? That's not quite answered in this film either, it seems that we learn one history in one movie or comic or cartoon, and then a different one in another.But that's what makes transformers great and why kids continue to love them to this day, because they are always changing, always transforming, while staying the same- mainly in the case of Bumblebee, and I was very pleased that they started making individual transformer films.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
51,alindsay-al,An awful long film that nobody should see.,2,2 June 2015,I am a big fan of the first transformers film but the last two haven't been the best films ever so I had mixed feelings before seeing this film. But this is one of the worst films if the year and was really hard to sit through almost 3 hours of this film. The premise of this film sees the humans tracking down and eliminating the autobots until an inventor finds optimus prime and helps him try and stop an intergalactic bounty hunter from taking out the autobots. Now Shia labouef is gone from this film replaced by Mark wahlberg who is your average guy and you do feel sympathy for his character but it is hard to care because his character just isn't that interesting. Optimus prime is the main returning autobot and he is still really cool and he is a cool character. Wahlbergs daughter in the film is really attractive but she shows no personality and is just as dull a female character as the previous transformers films. Her boyfriend is really dull as well and there is absolutely no character depth to him as well. Stanley tucci is a great actor but he is completely underutilized in this film and not used to the best of his ability. The same could be side about Kelsey grammar who has moments of good stuff but is also completely underutilized. None of the new transformers are interesting at all and you won't care about any of them at all. The story is where this film breaks down because there is just way too much going on in this film that you will not care about. There is like three or four villains that the film tries to integrate but fails to do it in any way shape or form. There is once again a maguffin that isn't explained at all so you don't understand why you should care at all. You won't care about the romance and anybody in this film. Also the film promised the dinobots and they are only in the film for the maximum of 20 minutes which is incredibly disappointing. The script tries to be funny but once again it fails with any of its humour or drama because nobody is funny and you don't care about any of the characters. The action scenes for the most part were pretty cool with the action working but unfortunately some of the cgi is really bad and really hinders the film. Also this film is 2 hours and 45 mins which is unacceptable for a film that really has absolutely no substance to it. Overall this is alongside revenge of the fallen for the worst transformer film and it should be avoided.,Transformers - Age of Extinction
52,estebangonzalez10,A big hit in China! (Probably because they didn't have to endure the terrible script),4,15 July 2014,"""But when you look up to the stars, think of them as my soul.""Michael Bay is back at it again delivering a longer and louder sequel full of headache inducing action scenes. It's funny that a film like this, with no soul, puts so much emphasis in trying to convince us that these Transformers actually have one. The film felt like a parable warning us about the dangers of cloning and animal testing, but it was completely uninspiring. There was no reason for this film to be so long and at times I think that the over extended action scenes end up becoming anti-climactic. There is a scene at the beginning of the film where a theater owner is complaining how sequels are killing the industry (a clear parody of itself) and if Bay was trying to make fun of critics as old timers then I wouldn't mind being called a grumpy old man because this film was just terrible. The characters in this film are completely one dimensional and their sole purpose in this film was to allow for an excuse to jump from one action scene to the next. You have the now classic female lead role from Bay not doing anything else than looking good in front of the camera, and several attempts at humor from the rest of the supporting characters who simply seem to be in the movie in order to give funny one- liners. For every funny line, there were ten that didn't work. The film does look great; there is a beautiful scenery and cool looking CGI action scenes but it simply felt like another empty attempt at delivering a loud blockbuster. For Bay it seems like more is better, but for me with every new sequel that comes out I grow more unresponsive towards these cartoon characters that I once loved as a young kid. It's a shame because I did like the first film, but the sequels have ruined it for me.Having Mark Wahlberg play the lead role instead of Shia LaBeouf was an interesting move considering he is more of an action star. I tend to like Wahlberg's action films, but he wasn't enough to save this film considering the real stars are the soulless giant metal robots. I also found Stanley Tucci to be a great addition although at times he did get on my nerves, but the blame for that has to be put on the poor script written by Ehren Kruger. It's as if for two and a half hours we got beat over the head with one repeated action scene after another. I don't know, the entire experience left me a bit dumbstruck and I was utterly disappointed even though my expectations were really low going into this sequel. At times I wondered if Bay's title, ""Age of Extinction,""was referring to the future of blockbusters, but when I thought of what other directors did with films like X-Men and Edge of Tomorrow (to mention a few) I calmed down and realized some directors actually are making smart and intelligent blockbusters. Bay on the other hand is making the same film over and over again with the exception that they get longer and louder. Fans who are looking for this will be pleased because Bay gives you an all you can eat buffet of action scenes involving giant metal robots battling off one another while cities are being destroyed. I never thought I would say this, but Pacific Rim was a much better movie at that.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
53,Fluke_Skywalker,Less than meets the eye,5,28 June 2014,"After three films I'm not exactly sure how you make nearly three hours of ceaseless robot carnage compelling, and apparently neither does director Michael Bay.'Transformers: Age of Extinction' introduces an entirely new set of human characters and changes locales, but it's otherwise a carbon copy of what we've seen before. Mark Wahlberg leads our human cast and he does his best despite the bad script and paper thin character he's given. Newcomers Nicola Peltz and Jack Reynor struggle to do anything but look attractive while outrunning mass destruction, and vets Kelsey Grammar and Stanley Tucci give professional, but dispassionate performances that scream ""Paycheck!"".But it's ultimately the joyless action that sinks 'Extinction'. We're given absolutely zero reason to care about the outcome, and thus the non-stop deluge of conflict that makes up the third act quickly becomes tedious.'Age of Extinction' is more or less the same film we've seen three times before, but it's not nearly as absorbing. Let that sink in for a minute.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
54,sauravjoshi85,Didn't someone told the makers that they need a story also,5,24 April 2020,"Transformers: Age of Extinction is a science fiction action movie directed by Michael Bay and stars Mark Wahlberg, Nicola Peltz, Jack Reynor, Stanley Tucci, Kelsey Grammer, Sophia Myles, Li Bingbing, T.J.

The best part of the movie is the movie is very action packed with amazing special effects and unfortunately these are the only best part of the movie.The start of the movie is good and interesting but as soon as the movie progresses it's fells apart as director wanted to try too many things.Acting is just ok and Mark Wahlberg is under-utilised. The biggest drawback of the movie is headless plot and length. The movie also gets slow and boring in between.The movie is purely for action lovers and some viewers can be disappointed with the length of the movie.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

56,3xHCCH,"Generally Entertaining, but Felt Overstuffed and Bloated",6,25 June 2014,"Michael Bay sets this fourth installment of the Transformers film franchise further into the future after the Battle of Chicago. At this time, man is waging a war against all alien robots, including our friendly Autobots. In fact, all the Autobots have been destroyed except for five: the ever-dependable Bumblebee, the green paratrooper Crosshairs, the cigar-chomping and bearded Hound, the blue samurai-like Drift, and of course, everybody's all-time favorite, Optimus Prime.For the human characters, gone are the Witwickys and enter the Yaegers. Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) is an engineer and frustrated inventor of household robots. He has a pretty (and whiny) 17-year old daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz), whom he guards like a hawk. But of course, she has a secret boyfriend Shane (Jack Raynor), who was a racecar driver.When Cade bought a rundown trailer truck for $150 to fix up, little did he know that he was buying the damaged Optimus Prime himself, putting him and his family right in the path of the government people, led by the double-dealing Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammar). Attinger seeks to destroy all Transformers for good, but has connived with the ruthless mercenary robot Lockdown to do the job. The action brings the Yaegers and the Autobots from Texas to Beijing then Hong Kong, battling not only human soldiers, but also fantastic new robots created by the arrogant Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci) and his company. These were made from a new programmable element called ""Transformium"" obtained from remnants of destroyed Transformers including Megatron, whose evil ""spirit"" has somehow entered the new leader robot Galvatron. You can see from the lengthy synopsis that there are many new characters, both human and robot in this story. It can get difficult to remember and follow all of them. I have not even mentioned the robot T- Rex Grimlock and the other Dinobots, which also make their spectacular debut in this film. The film runs more than two hours and a half. The story telling is very uneven. The introductory scenes went on for so long. The pacing can be so off-putting and even boring. The lines were generally corny clichés, like before. There were a lot of product placement advertisements, most memorably Bud Light. Only when the Transformers come out and actually fight with explosive force does the movie truly come alive. The film is generally entertaining with awesome special visual and sound effects for the robots. It was particularly fun to see OP act like Voltes V complete with sword and all. There are some very exciting car chase scenes and fight scenes for the human characters as well. Stanley Tucci steals the scenes in his humorous take on an annoying character.This one though simply tried to stuff in too much that it became bloated and tedious at several points. With all his talents, Mark Wahlberg did not seem to be a right fit for this franchise. I can't believe I am saying this, but I actually enjoyed the Shia Lebeouf films more than I did this one.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
57,adamjohns-42575,A Film About Trans Rights Disguised As A Film About Robots In Disguise?,5,25 April 2021,"I was warned not to expect too much from this film, so I was actually surprised that it was, if nothing else at least as good as the last one of the series (Dark Of The Moon).There are hints of 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang' at the beginning as Mark Wahlberg stars as a crazy inventor whose daughter is neglected while he tries to do up an old truck to make their fortune. The Truck is of course Optimus Prime, who has gone into hiding and I have to say that at this stage of the series, having been repeatedly defeated and killed, etc, he doesn't seem to be the hero that he's alleged to be and quite frankly would get nowhere without Bumblebee.It is, as my nephew would say, obviously a Michael Bay film and you can tell by all of the explosions and corny super hero moments and poses. It would be slightly less corny if it wasn't for the over protective Dad thing that has been so overdone in films and the annoying Barbie Doll daughter, who's been pulling the wool over Daddies eyes for years.In a lot of respects Marky Mark's character is reminiscent of his role in 'Ted' and you might wonder if this isn't the ""What came next"" storyline for that series. Throw in a talking teddy bear and a few more jokes and it's as likely as their shenanigans with 'Flash Gordon'.I personally think it would have worked better if Mark had been father to Shane and thus a little less overbearing with regards to him as he is with the daughter, Tessa. She really didn't add anything to the story at all.I was also annoyed that the very talented Stanley Tucci was doing a very good job as a bad guy, but was suddenly turned into an 'Austin Powers' villain, becoming the butt of all jokes. And actually with the previous films I have stated that I don't think that there needs to be as much comic relief as there is, but with this one I think they could have skipped it all together, barring the quips that Bumblebee and the Autobots occasionally come out with and fit in more organically (Ironically).It's nice to see Kelsey Grammar as a bad guy for a change and it is a vast improvement on his 'Scrooge'.I was glad, however to see an early exit for T. J. Miller, who irritates the Hell out of me in everything he does.I would like to know who Lockdown's people are and where they've suddenly come from, as this is not explained, which confuses the issue as you think that they are Decepticon's to start with? And I think the film gets a bit lost with its origins and things too.In general though, I really didn't mind this as a reboot, it must be really hard to come up with a new story and concept to keep the franchise going all the time, having repeatedly killed off the main bad guys and some of the good ones too. I'm not sure that this film wasn't actually paid for by sponsorship as it did seem to be one big advert. See how many brands you can spot being blatantly plugged? Maybe that's how they keep getting funding for these lacklustre new chapters to be made?",Transformers - Age of Extinction
58,Spondonman,The Never Ending Story,6,18 October 2014,"The clue is in the title: Age; that's how long it is. I had some problems getting this one for my daughter's partner and inadvertently - and regrettably - saw enough of it to form an opinion. Basically it's not for me, being an old codger and having never seen anything of Transformers, ever, I came at this totally cold and that's how it's left me, totally cold.One bunch of big robots is up against another, bashing smashing and mashing with and without human interference. A friend called it breathtaking, I see now what he meant – it almost took my breath away with its ghastly tedious turgidity. I realise of course I know nothing of the History or the World of this little lot, that I'm definitely in an incorrect demographic, and that it was a very, very well made well photographed and produced live action cgi cartoon that has more than recouped the utter fortune spent on it but! It's relentless – I'm not sure it'll ever finish, I think I can still hear Kelsey Grammar gutturally growling about something somewhere. Did I just see an entire season? I would say the kids will love it, but they'll come away from it as young adults. And only eight minutes of end credits after all that went before... The metallic characters are so laughable and the non-metallic so wooden and non-engaging as to make you root for nothing but a holocaust. Tears For Fears' Mad World gets ripped off a couple of times too but that's kinda apt. Mark Wahlberg playing a protective father was first cute then creepy then plain irritating, Stanley Tucci as initially a main baddie was almost impressive to begin with but became almost slapstick as the hours went by. There were many robot verbal witticisms throughout, even some I could laugh at but everything is forgotten in the lengthy noisy rambling mess.The movie kept a lot of skillful people in a lot of jobs and kept a lot of intelligent people happy watching it but to me it's way too much of a crap thing and probably just to be added to Optimus Prime's mysteries to the Universe why so many people enjoyed it.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Mark Ryan is really good as Lockdown, one of the franchise's best villains. The CG is incredible.

61,Seraphion,Quite an entertainment for me,7,29 June 2014,"The movie continues from Transformers: Dark of The Moon (2011). Humans abolished the human-Autobot alliance and the Autobots are now being hunted down. Early in the movie, humans aided by a transformer, Lockdown, take down Ratchet. The human protagonist is now Cade Yeager, a self-proclaimed inventor, who unknowingly buys a truck that happens to be the injured Optimus Prime. The team that got Ratchet finds Cade and tries to capture him, his daughter Tessa, and his friend Lucas. Tessa's boyfriend Shane comes along. Prime saves them, and gets chased by Lockdown. The humans, minus Lucas, escape in Prime. He recaptures a new rig truck look and rallies the remaining Autobots. Snooping around KSI company, Cade and Shane find them making man-made transformers. Their covers are then blown and soon they escape with the Autobots. KSI and the CIA agent Attinger sent the man-made transformers on them, Galvatron, the Optimus wannabe with Megatron's essence, and Stinger, a Bumblebee wannabee. Prime can redress the two but then Lockdown comes in and beats him. He then gets taken with Tessa trapped under him to Lockdown's mother ship where Tessa sees the spec-ops that stormed her place receive a 'seed' from Lockdown. With the Autobots, Cade and Shane sneaks into the mother ship and one of the Autobots deploys the ship's anchors. The Autobots manage to free Prime and Cade and Shane saves Tessa. Exchanging info, the seed turns out to be big transformer-making bomb which Galvatron, which turn out to be the reincarnated Megatron, wants. The KSI leader Joyce then moves Galvatron to China and receives the seed from Attinger. Galvatron suddenly activates itself and commands the other man-made transformers to seek out the seed to detonate it. Joyce, giving in to Cade's warning, brings the seed to the Autobots, but their ship is shot down. Cade gets chased by the spec-ops men and later Attinger. Prime, who's ship shot down a bit father away, gets reinforcements by freeing Lockdown's 'trophies', the Dinobots and wrestling their leader to gain their allegiance. With the combined force of the Autobots and Dinobots, Galvatron's lackeys can be handled and Prime faces Lockdown but he is again beaten and gets nailed to a kiln, but Tessa and Shane gets back and helps pull the sword that nails Prime. Prime then back stabs Lockdown and Galvatron flees the scene.The story is really nice and fresh, and at the same time able to be detailed and complex. The direction is great, now it's not just explosions here and there, but there are also nice shots of mêlée fights of both transformers and humans. The addition of the Dinobots is a great way to start a new trilogy franchise, and add to that Optumus Prime's departure. The human protagonist cast now having no military background makes the characters more able to be related by the majority of viewers.The acting overall is unfortunately quite a so-so for me. Mark Wahlberg is only good at the action scenes but goes quite numb at the talking scenes. He wasn't funny on most of the joke scenes. Nicola Peltz overacted on most of her part, while Jack Reynor is just there as a complimentary guy and couldn't enliven his role more. Strangely the better and more convincing acting is performed by those with the antagonist roles, Stanley Tucci and Kelsey Grammar.The choice of sets and locations is nice as a mix, from the countrysides to city skyscraper to rundown Chinese apartment complex. The costumes are also picked out well that they help focus the attention t the characters, as well as the makeup.Gor me this movie has been a really good two-hour plus entertainment and it deserves a solid 7 out of 10 score and a definite recommendation to go see it in the cinema. I know I won't be sorry to go and watch it again.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
62,rgkarim,Too much jammed into one film makes it a mess,6,27 June 2014,"When you think of Michael Bay what do you think? No I'm not making a joke about him ruining every movie series, but instead explosions, slow running, and unbalanced qualities in a movie. Years ago the director was able to impress us with his big budget productions of giant robots fighting each other, launching chaotic explosions in an attempt to accomplish a goal, all the while protecting a select few humans. That trend has continued, and this weekend his latest work Transformers 4, age of extinction releases in an attempt to make up for some of his follies in the last few years. What is the verdict on this movie? Read on to find out.Once again Bay has managed to outdo himself, somehow mistakenly defining balance with cramming as many things into one movie as possible. The first movie in this new trilogy attempts to explain what has happened over the last four years while trying to introduce a set of new characters in the process. Normally this would be fine, except the director attempted to develop a rather poor love story, while developing a darker story for the Autobots, and trying to give equal screen time to robot and human alike. So many variables are difficult to balance for any director, and I felt it was a challenge too great for this director. The result is a hodge-podge of half complete aspects that make for a rather rushed and disproportionate movie, when it could be so much simpler and entertaining. What do I mean by this? It's really simple, when I go see a movie about Transformers I want to see a movie about CGI behemoths fighting each other for a goal with all robots having some ample contribution to the battle. He was able to do this in the first movie, but lately Bay and company have had a fixation on one or two robots (Usually Optimus and Bumblebee) or showing humans running from the aliens while attempting to lighten the situation with a flood of jokes and offset comedy. Sure comedy is a good thing, but I didn't sign up for nearly three hours of Mark Wahlberg and Stanley Tucci making fools of themselves. Yes they were a huge improvement from the previous cast, but again I came for the robots, not the humans. However, it is not all bad, as Bay has improved on the action substantially mixing a blend of high speed chases, city wide shoot outs, and loud melee's that shake the theater. What helps is that editing has improved their ability to differentiate robots, creating combatants with individual qualities that help them stand out, while also keeping camera work decently stable. Unfortunately not every Autobot has an equal role in the combat, with Bay once again favoring one or two autobots despite having five available. Fans of Bumblebee will love the cute little robot's scenes, but they have redesigned him and with a bit of an attitude, developing a darker edge like the rest of his compadres, and getting half his normal screen time. Optimus and newcomer Hound, voiced by John Goodman, the latter of which spouts out jokes and orders while wrecking his way through hordes of enemy robots. Their actions scenes were great, but I ask Bay again, why not take a lesson from the Avengers and actually show all your heroes fighting, instead of just one or two. This is especially true for the Dinobots, whose announcement at the Super Bowl trailer had fans screaming in delight. While their designs are epic these beasts do not appear until near the end, and most of them don't really do much other than run into buildings. What was the point of even bringing them in this installment then if you weren't going to do much with them? I guess that happens when you stuff too many things into one movie huh?As for the story, well it's an improvement over the last two installments, with a much darker twist and suspenseful tone. No one is safe in the high hostility world, as there are many disturbing treatments to a world that was lighthearted. Optimus, as well as the other Autobots, are no longer the embodiment of good guys who praise justice and equality, but are more like mercenaries doing what they have to do. To offset this darker tone, is the lighter human story whose characters are hastily developed into generic, carbon copy comedians and tight clothed eye candy. Both stories were hastily developed, leaving lots of plot gaps, stretches of the imagination, and lackluster emotion that was incredibly humorous. Yet there were some plot twists put into the mold that non comic book readers will enjoy, most of which set the stage for the next movie that is sure to come. I rather enjoyed the direction, but am unsure of where Bay will go next with the choices he made in this film. There is a lot more to talk about in this film, but I'm running out of room. All in all TF4 is a blockbuster smash whose editing and special effects are meant for the big screen. While it is a menagerie of various movie qualities, both well and badly done, I enjoyed it more than I did some of its predecessors. Fans of the series will most likely enjoy it, and will get their laughs from cheesy dialog and over the top advertising found in the film, as chaos and firework explosions erupt on the scene. I think it's worth a trip to the theater in my opinion and definitely worth a shot in 3-D if you have a chance to do it, though I believe there are other movies coming out that will be better use of your time and money. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 7.5 Movie Overall: 7.0",Transformers - Age of Extinction
63,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Transformers: Age of Extinction,6,28 June 2014,"I read somewhere that director Michael Bay got his start filing storyboards for Steven Spielberg via Raiders of the Lost Ark. Cut to 2014 and he's (financially) one of the most successful filmmakers around. He isn't however critic proof because he seems totally infatuated with blowing stuff up. Between making movies, I've always been curious to know what he does in his spare time. And for the record, I would probably stay away from going to any Fourth of July parties he might be hosting.Anyway, summer is here and that means another exhausting Transformers movie. Now I know that everyone in the free world is going to see it. But if you the moviegoer haven't bought a ticket yet, well let me give you some insight on what you're getting into. As expected, Transformers: Age of Extinction (the film I'm reviewing) is one bloated, convoluted mess of a movie. It looks like it cost about 9 billion dollars to make and it feels like a trillion special effects shots were used. One thing is missing though and that would be a sense of continuity when it comes to the workings of I guess, the plot.Bay is up to his old tricks again for this newest Hasbro helping. As usual he deals another round of fast edits, laughably bad slow motion framing, low, non-stop camera movements (and angles), and recycled background music (with plenty of horns playing the same notes over and over). His movies may look good in HD but he's ADHD as a director.Now the special effects as mentioned earlier, are sick (this is meant to be a compliment). ""Extinction"" is total and complete eye candy. But sadly, it feels like no one who worked on it bothered to step inside an editing room. Watching this newest entry from executive producer Spielberg was a chore because it was as if no scene was ever cut out. I mean, instead of viewing a full length feature film, all we get as an audience, is endless hours of randomly shot footage that is literally hurled at the screen. Transformers: Age of Extinction is 2 hours and 45 minutes long. It's 21 minutes longer than the original, 15 minutes longer than Revenge of the Fallen, and 9 minutes longer than Dark of the Moon. It ends hinting at the chance of yet another chapter in this franchise's long running cash juggernaut. So OK, if the next Transformers movie is 3 hours long, I'm going to lose my freaking head.In addition to overlength and misbegotten excess, ""Extinction"" just like the other Transformers movies, resorts to using a ton of locations. This thing uses cities in Michigan, Texas, Utah, Illinois, and Hong Kong, China as its go-to settings. The storytelling, well don't even try to keep up with it. Broke inventor Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) and his daughter Tessa (played by newcomer Nicole Peltz) find an Autobot in their barn. That's all I'm gonna say because all heck breaks loose from then on. The government gets involved and another helping of mass destruction is served up on a silver platter. And yes, Chicago, IL once again gets somewhat destroyed and decimated here. Is it the taxes, the traffic, the Cubs, or the cold winters that get aliens so ticked off at ""The Windy City?"" I happen to live there so I'm gonna go with all the above.Compared to the other two sequels (and the favorable original), I liked the cast a whole lot better this time around. Kelsey Grammar as CIA agent Harold Attinger plays the heavy with gusto. Stanley Tucci is on board as well and he gives a standard Stanley Tucci performance (which is a good thing). As for Mark Wahlberg in the lead, well he surprised me. He's a riot playing a sort of quirky, fast talking widower who's overly protective of his daughter. In fact, Wahlberg is so darn appealing that in only one of these films, he's able to out act Shia LaBeouf who appeared in the previous three. Check that Shia La ""Bad"" (Oh and I almost forgot, Mark Wahlberg's character is from Texas but he has no southern drawl or accent. It's merely just an observation and not a big deal).Overall, I'm gonna give this vehicle a mixed review which is being pretty nice to Sir Michael Bay. Go see it for the sumptuous visuals and load up on the popcorn. Oh and I think I got the title for the next installment. Let's go with Transformers: The Musical (just kidding).Of note: the battles between the Decepticons and Autobots (a given in Transformers pictures) are so messy and chaotic, you can't tell who is fighting who. At one point, I thought the Autobots were fighting their own kind and you know, that's not a good thing. And watch for famed actor John Goodman doing a voice of one of the Transformers named Hound. His overweight, bearded character is a downright hoot. At one point, he calls himself a ""badass ballerina."" Uh-huh.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
64,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,New things but same feeling,5,28 June 2014,"When Transformers (2007) came out, no one knew what to expect. No one had ever seen such clever visuals, big action, effective music and the cast, although not Oscar material, entertained at the level it should have. It was something special and a movie director Michael Bay and writer Ehren Kruger did the right way. Two sequels later, this Hollywood moneymaker duo learned things along the way about what elements they needed to incorporate to make its diminishing returns feel not so out of place. Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) recovered back a little bit of what Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009) messed up and by the end, one would've hoped it would be a while for the next installment. Three years later wasn't long enough. This sequel, like the rest are competently made with its production but its writing no longer works or convinces.Viewers will now be introduced to Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) a widower / robot inventor who's struggling to make a living and support his daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) through school. After discovering an abandoned truck, Cade realizes that he's in the possession of transformer, Optimus Prime. What Cade doesn't realize is that the government is hunting the autobots, which are allied with Lockdown - whom can't be really said to be a Decepticon. He's more of a middleman. And this would be fine if that's all that it was. Instead, Ehren Kruger writes an extremely thin plot and covers it with too many human characters and several subplots. One of these subplots is about how the ancient relatives of the transformers were the reason for the dinosaurs being burnt to a crisp. Really? Could that be thrown in any more lazily? It's just another reason to say why transformers were on earth.The human characters are a totally different ball of wax. Credit is given for Wahlberg being a much stronger character than Shia LaBeouf's and fighting back instead of screaming like a sissy. But Cade Yeager as a robot inventor, in the middle of urban Texas doesn't feel practical. Aren't there other lucrative occupations? Other cast members are much of the same from the last films. One of them being that Cade's daughter is the damsel in distress who has a boyfriend that's always after her. Of course, there are always those few human characters that are annoying to listen to on screen and are put in for comic relief. There are even areas of development for these individuals, which are just for comedy. Come on, its no longer funny. All it is, is the Kruger/Bay method of writing. For the transformers, it's strange how over time Optimus Prime maintains his autobot group when there are new ones every sequel. It's not to say they aren't cool but their background is never told. Where do they come from? The best of the bunch though was Hound played by John Goodman. He was a nice highlight. The dinobots were another interesting aspect to the film because of their magnitude. However, like many other transformers they received little development other than being ancient transformers and somehow being the ""creators"" of Prime. As a pseudo-sequel to its predecessors, it does keep its connections but its continuity lacks depth and feels loose. The battle at Chicago is mentioned many times, but of what happened to the main bunch of other main cast members is a mystery. Why a few words couldn't be said about them, I won't get. Another weird thing about this movie is that out of all the films released, this one felt like the longest. This is mostly due to the action sequences. Like any Michael Bay film, the action will be big, but this one in particular felt like he wanted to make every action sequence feel like the finale to the film. Oddly enough when the finale came, it felt less climactic than expected because every action scene before it was just as big and bombastic. I was desensitized.The music composed by Steve Jablonsky is nothing short of bad but no longer impresses. He continues to maintain the booming action cues and noble Prime theme but his tracks no longer felt memorable. It's sad because Transformers no doubt is a strong franchise that should be treated in the right way. And although Michael Bay is key to what made it great, his ability to keep it afloat isn't working by cramming several 20 minute long action sequences and over stuffing the plot with multiple pointless characters. It'll definitely keep a young person's attention but I don't guarantee the required substance. Worse, is that you know another will be on its way, made in the exact same manner.It's just as big and heavy duty as the past films with its music and action sequences but its writing has become lazy. The voice and physical cast try, but by now, the novelty has worn off. It's just being shoveled out knowing people will go just because.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
65,Rob_Taylor,Michael Bay... Just stop already!,5,17 September 2014,"So, this is a 2 hour 45 minute movie, which is far too long for a start. A lot of those minutes, especially the early ones, are made up of Mark Wahlberg acting like an imbecile father and his clearly not-teenage daughter, acting like an imbecile teenager.When anyone mentions Michael Bay, you get a laugh and comments about explosions, but here, at least from the first half of the movie, you understand what Michael Bay is really all about...Playing with his toys.He is like a little kid, moving his toys around and lost in a little world all of his own. I don't know if he truly thinks his reduction of adult characters to moronic teenagers works, or if he just doesn't know how to direct adults. Likewise, his incessant use of terribly racist stereotypes is painful to watch. Even more so when the character is not human in the first place, and would have no reason to talk and act like a human.All in all, this is another Michael Bay action-fest that quickly gets boring. No one puts more action into their movies than Bay, and no one makes that action as dull and tedious as Bay. For a movie whose central premise is shape-shifting robots, how can those robots be so direly unimaginative and boring.To be fair, this is probably the best Transformers movie since the first one, but the running time is way overlong and there really isn't anything new to see here. The much heralded Dinobots show up for like ten minutes towards the end and that's the end of that.The one ray of sunshine in this otherwise endurance testing movie comes in the form of the Stanley Tucci's sudden character shift playing one of the bad guys. He goes from being intent on ruling the world of robotics, to actively helping the heroes to save the day. What's more, he is actually pretty funny whilst he does it.But whilst this reversal injects a welcome comedy break into a movie that otherwise tries hard to be serious (and fails), it also highlights the real failing of the movie...The characters are bland and boring. All of them. Even the Transformers.That a single character (Tucci's Joshua Joyce) can come out of nowhere and steal every scene that he is in, just shows how lacking the rest are for any kind of depth.Ultimately, I think this is why the movies fail. You just don't really care about any of the characters. Wahlberg is saddled with the ultra-stereotypical overprotective father. His daughter is saddled with ""Rebellious Teen"" and her boyfriend is saddled with an atrociously bad Irish accent.There was some nice slow-mo work with the robots, but a little too much. Still, it was nice to see what was actually going on for once. Despite the longer running time, I didn't come away from this one with a massive headache, as I did after watching the previous outing, so something was done better.All things considered however, this is a movie for die-hard fans, and fans of Bay's particular brand of Transformers at that. For everyone else the saying ""A lot of sound and fury, signifying nothing"" holds very true.SUMMARY: For series fans only. Nothing much here for the casual viewer.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
66,yoggwork,The worst part of this series,5,20 February 2019,"The worst part of this series is a piece of watered pork. The plot is rigid, the story line is chaotic, the rhythm is slow and the advertisement is overwhelming. Numerous details have nothing to do with the main line, such as KSI President's entanglement with music when he appeared, I don't know what he wanted to say in those three minutes.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
67,brando647,At Least It's Not REVENGE OF THE FALLEN...,4,13 March 2015,"TRANSFORMERS: AGE OF EXTINCTION is where I draw the line. Just as I've reached my limit with the DIE HARD franchise, so it is with TRANSFORMERS. I'm done. We're four movies deep in this franchise and the bad outweighs the good so heavily that I refuse to go to a theater to see another unless I see a Rotten Tomatoes score of 80% or above. I understand that guideline might seem a little strict (there have been plenty of great movies where Rotten Tomatoes didn't reflect it with the critics) but TRANSFORMERS needs to really break out the good stuff to get me back in a theater seat to watch another. AGE OF EXTINCTION was an excruciating two hours and forty- five minutes long, and I haven't felt this robbed of my valuable time sincelet me thinkREVENGE OF THE FALLEN. Before you think I'm just a TRANSFORMERS or Michael Bay hater, let me mention that I actually really liked the first movie and I even found a lot to enjoy in the third movie. I hated the second, but I was willing to write that off as a fluke because it came about during a writers' strike that could've contributed to how horrible it was. But this one has no excuse and it's forced me to reflect on the ones I liked (and, for the record, can still enjoy) and realize just how hollow and meaningless these cash grabs are. Michael Bay was originally going to retire from the franchise and let someone else direct the fourth film, but he saw how long the lines were at a new Transformers theme park ride and was inspired by the fans' excitement to return and direct AGE OF EXTINCTION. Don't be fooledit wasn't the enthusiasm of the fans that brought him back. It was dollar signs. He saw dollar signs above the heads of those fans and knew he could churn out another easy paycheck from the suckers. I was one of those suckers, but not anymore.I'm not going to bother giving a synopsis of the plot for AGE OF EXTINCTION. It's pointless. Let me simplify it. There's a new MacGuffin indistinguishable from any of the others that came before it. Megatron (in his new form, Galvatron) wants to get his hands on it forevil stuff. Mark Wahlberg is the franchise's new hero as a scientist from Texas. Kelsey Grammar is the evil government operative who wants to kill all Transformers and Stanley Tucci is a parody of Steve Jobs who wants to use Transformers technology for whatever. There are a lot of pointless supporting characters, most of whom I couldn't be bothered to learn their names. There's racist caricatures, blatant product placement (ughthe Bud Light moment), and pandering to China in an effort to boost Bay's paycheck even further into the stratosphere. There are a ridiculous amount of oversized and often unjustifiable explosions, and a civilian body count that causes me to wonder why it doesn't receive the same fanboy rage as MAN OF STEEL. Physics are defied for convenience, people are superhuman, and once again I can't tell which Transformer is which because who really cares at this point.Oh, but wait, I've forgetting about the main draw behind AGE OF EXTINCTION: the Dino-bots! Yes, we finally get the Dino-bots. I mean, they were all over the advertisements for this film, right? And it's got ""extinction"" right there in the title. I mean, this has just got to be a dino-heavy movie, right? No, no it's not. Sure, we get Dino-botsabout two hours and twenty minutes into the movie. And really, you can tell they were shoehorned in to cater to the legion of drooling fans who've been clamoring for them since the first film. And to be honest, I wasn't that impressed with them. They were just more CG vomit thrown into the typical TRANSFORMERS overblown final action sequence where things are exploding around the screen and horrible one-liners are spouted until Optimus Prime lands the final blow and grants mercy to the audience by ending the film. Again, I enjoyed TRANSFORMERS and DARK OF THE MOON. They had some entertainment value. AGE OF EXTINCTION has none. This one is merely an endurance trial to see how much CG robot carnage the audience can withstand. I mean, Bay does remember this series is based on a line of toys, cartoons, etc. for kids, right? I mean, what kid is going to sit through this?Let's finish with the film's ""characters"". Look, I like Mark Wahlberg. He's done some fun stuff (THE OTHER GUYS, PAIN & GAIN) but I don't buy him as a scientist. If he's a scientist, then Denise Richards is a nuclear physicist. And how does a garage inventor know how to handle himself in armed combat as well as he does in this movie? His daughter (Nicola Peltz) is a sniveling, ungrateful brat who wears shorts way too short for what's supposed to be a seventeen-year-old. Didn't stop Bay from focusing that character on her butt in those shorts, though. Close-up, of course. That was just uncomfortable and weird. Her boyfriend is a rally car driver that's impossible to like because he loves to flaunt to Wahlberg that he loves to get freaky with his underage daughter. You'd think he'd redeem himself later with some heroic stuff but, no, when he's given the chance on the Knightship halfway through the film he proves to be a coward. Kelsey Grammar is a one-note ""evil government suit"" and Stanley Tucci goes from a potentially interesting villain to a joke halfway through the movie. You know who didn't suck in this movie? T.J. Miller. He was the one bit of fun in the whole thing and he's gone after the first half hour. So there's that.The nicest thing I can say about AGE OF EXTINCTION: at least it's not REVENGE OF THE FALLEN.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
68,moviexclusive,"The best 'Transformers' film yet, this reboot has a better lead actor, a more interesting Autobots character dynamic, and even more breathtaking excess and spectacle",8,25 June 2014,"We've had enough of Shia. Shia LaBeouf, that is. Thankfully, Michael Bay felt the same way. Which is why this fourth entry of the Paramount/ Hasbro live-action cartoon junks its lead actor for the past three instalments and instead sets Mark Wahlberg as its anchor. Better still, Bay has sent his entire franchise into reboot, retooling not only his cast but also his story and characters. And hey, for all you naysayers who thought Bay's return meant more of the same, well we're here to tell you that 'Age of Extinction' is more entertaining, more thrilling and more breathtaking than any of its predecessors - to put it simply, it's the best 'Transformers' film so far.On that count alone, we'd say Bay deserves kudos. Let's face it - the reason why every 'Transformers' film has been scheduled in the summer movie-going season is that it is meant as no more and no less than a perfect piece of popcorn entertainment packed with excess and spectacle. Indeed, there is no point faulting Ehren Kruger's screenplay for being over-convoluted and under-developed at the same time. With the Decepticons destroyed, Kruger had to find a way to replace or resurrect them - hence the entry of two man-made robots, Galvatron and Stinger, both of which were manufactured by tech corp KSI founder Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci) using the fallen Megatron as a blueprint. But it isn't just these synthetic Transformers that the Autobots led by Optimus Prime (voiced again by Peter Cullen) have to contend with; their creator has apparently sent a bounty hunter Lockdown (voiced by Jack Ryan) after Prime, the former of whom has forged a shaky alliance with the shady CIA official Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammar) to capture Prime in exchange for an elemental device known as the Seed.Caught in the middle are Texan Cade Yeager (Wahlberg), his 17-year-old daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) and her boyfriend Shane (Jack Reynor). Cade finds himself caught in the government conspiracy to destroy the Autobots when he brings home an old truck he finds inside a rundown movie theatre that he had intended to strip down to sell its parts for cash, but also becomes the one who nurses Optimus back to health to rendezvous with the rest of the Autobots - Bumblebee, Hound (John Goodman), Drift (Ken Watanabe) and Crosshairs (John DiMaggio). Of course, his intentions aren't all altruistic – Tessa is unwittingly separated from her father when Lockdown sends Optimus packing for space, so Cade springs into action to save his daughter.If you find yourself struggling to understand the intricacies of the plot, well you don't necessarily need to try. Its purpose as always is to serve as narrative glue for the plentiful action sequences, which are undoubtedly the highlight of the whole enterprise, and boy do these really pop off the screen. The Autobots' raid on the KSI Headquarters in Chicago at the 40-minute mark powers the film's momentum like a locomotive that doesn't stop, moving swiftly and seamlessly from within the futuristic building to the freeway where Galvatron and Stinger are first mobilised into battle and then over the skies of Chicago where Optimus – as well as Tessa – are taken on board Lockdown's spacecraft.Bay doesn't quite do intimate, but even on his level, there is an undeniable ambition in the sheer scale of these sequences. More so than in any of his previous movies, his signature traits of wide panning shots and slo-mos work beautifully to give the audience a sense of the extent of the destruction going on all around – one particularly awesome sequence has Prime and Bumblebee juggling Cade, Tessa and Shane as they leap over a flyover to avoid Galvatron's missiles. The folks at ILM have also truly outdone themselves this time; not only are the visual effects nothing short of stunning, the detail with which they manage to execute the 'Transformations' is doubly impressive, especially when seen up close on the IMAX screen. And on his part, Bay holds his camera steady most of the time, avoiding the jitters that marred the viewing experience especially on the first two movies.You're probably wondering why we haven't yet mentioned the part of the action in Hong Kong, or more accurately parts of China, which feature more prominently than one would expect. Unfortunately, those expecting the action on this side of the globe to dazzle will probably come off a little disappointed. Compared to that which unfolds in the first two- thirds of the film, this last stretch feels significantly more uneven. In lively verisimilitude, Bay unfolds the action alongside both Hong Kong's gleaming skyscrapers as well as its grimy tenement buildings; but the transition from one to the other lacks the fluency of the earlier sequences. Nonetheless, this is also where the Dinobots first make their appearance, and Optimus' riding into war atop a fire-breathing Gimlock still is a sight to behold.And yes, like what we said before, the 'Transformers' movies have always been about excess and spectacle; on both counts, Bay delivers tremendously. You'll feel right there in the heart of the action, and might we say, have your heart in your mouth more than half the time. Wahlberg is also a much more solid human anchor than LaBeouf ever was, though the same cannot be said of Peltz or Reynor. Optimus is even more compelling than in previous instalments, more jaded and simultaneously more decisive; and though Bumblebee gets less of the spotlight this time round, the focus on Hound, Drift and Crosshairs makes for a slightly more ragtag but also more interesting dynamic between them. But as always, this is meant to be summer popcorn entertainment, and you'll be glad to know that 'Age of Extinction' will probably leave you wowed.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
69,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Transformers: Age of Extinction""- The continued fall of a once-promising franchise...",3,17 July 2017,"I'm going to be perfectly upfront in admitting that I actually really enjoyed Michael Bay's first entry in the ""Transformers"" saga upon initial release in 2007, and I still maintain that it's a solid and entertaining work. It's not a great film by any means, but it's got a certain charm to its humor and it's wildly thrilling thanks to Bay's trademark kinetic visuals and ferocious editing. It's a perfect Summer popcorn film, full of eye-popping effects that still hold up and some charming performances from the cast.Then there were the sequels. Oh, boy. I will with some shame cop to the fact that I was one of the few defenders of the second entry in the series (""Revenge of the Fallen""), though in retrospect I've come to realize the movie to be nothing more than a woefully pale imitation of what came before- only bigger, louder and a great deal dumber. This was further compounded by the third go- around (""Dark of the Moon"") which thankfully cut back on the stupidity of that second film... but still wasn't able to stand on its own thanks to its own plethora of issues with the troublesome cast (replacing series co-star Megan Fox with a vapid Victoria's Secret model being particularly mind-numbing) and an over-bloated run-time. Needless to say, by the time the credits rolled on that third movie, I was pretty much done. And I ended up deciding that I was content with merely revisiting the first movie while ignoring everything that came after.But unfortunately for me, curiosity reared its ugly head, and I ended up popping on the fourth movie, ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"", about a year back for laughs. I figured with a few beers in me and a couple friends to joke around with, it might be worth checking out once. But, yeah... it's a complete and utter mess. A confused, bloated, boring and shockingly hard-to-follow dumpster fire of a film. And it sadly signals the biggest step-down in quality of the franchise thus-far. Trading in those belly-laughs and genuine gasps of excitement that the 2007 film specialized in... and instead delivering consistent groans of disbelief and annoyance.The film has no coherent plot to speak up, and instead is comprised of a writhing mass of tenuously connected ""story-lines"" that don't really mesh together all that well. I watched the film... I really did. And I can't remember a darned thing about it outside of the brain- destroying action and obnoxiously loud sound effects. It's something about how the Transformers are all being hunted down, and Optimus Prime ends up becoming entangled with a single father played by Mark Whalberg? And at the same time, some weird tech-genius CEO is ""cloning"" Transformers for military application? And there's this weird Transformer Bounty Hunter who is somehow in league with the military despite the military supposedly hunting down the Transformers? And somewhere in there, there's Dino-Bots and a random Doomsday- Weapon peppered in? And the opening implies that the Transformers have been around even longer than previously thought? And about a million other things are going on as well? You'd need enough Ritalin to kill a horse in order to understand what's going on in this movie.But maybe you don't care about the plot or the characters, and you're just interesting in explosive action and crazy visual effects. After all, that's what these movies are all about, right? Well, even on that front, this film feels bizarrely underwhelming, and it's just kind of dull and monotonous. Not only have the computer-generated effects not improved since the third film- they look like they've taken a step back, and objectively look even worse than they did in the first movie somehow. The Transformers have that weird plastic-y look to them that comes with bad rendering, and the animation is way too smooth, making them look more akin to Looney Tunes than real-life robots in disguise. I was half expecting Optimus to dig himself to Albuquerque by the time the film ended... And the action is so overdone that it loses all impact. The first film was so clever in how it built up to its explosive climax. This one just basically throws everything at the lens possible as often as it can, and it completely desensitizes the audience. You can't go so excessive so often, or else it loses meaning.And don't even get me started on the downright creepy and unsettling ""Romeo and Juliet Law"" subplot the film likes to throw in your face constantly. Yeah, the film has several scenes dedicated to the fact that the protagonist's 17-year-old daughter is dating a 20-year-old after they met in High School. OK, whatever, it happens I guess. But the movie doesn't just let it go... it reminds us of this fact way too often and goes into long-winded spiels about how it's ""totally legal"", and it becomes really unsettling really quickly. It feels less like the movie trying to set up conflict... and more like Michael Bay trying to explain why he thinks it's OK to objectify young women. It's really gross how much the film is obsessed with this minute plot- point.If there's one thing I can say to the film's credit, it's that Whalberg is a very likable and charismatic actor, and he's a good replacement for previous star Shia LaBeouf. And yeah, you do still care about the returning Autobots, simply because we've come to enjoy them after three previous films. But that's really all the film has going for it... The rest of the film is just a messy re-skin of what came before, but made way more convoluted and pointless by the needlessly excessive carnage, ridiculous script and creepy subtext. And for that, I give it a very poor 3 out of 10. Just stick with the first movie, folks. That's the only one that matters.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
70,quincytheodore,"It's severely lacking in plot and script, but Michael Bay pumps enough testosterone and gunpowder till the point of overdose.",5,29 June 2014,"Introducing new assembly of human cast, the movie offers fresh perspective, while not exactly stellar, but they are better than the previous one. Mark Wahlberg is a legitimate action star with a touch of comedy; he tries his best despite the lackluster script and does manage to pull off a few humorous scenes. Action does improve, after three movies with at least some jumbled scenes of slow motion debris, this time around there's more clarity to be had. It's not as much as a visual masterpiece as Michael Bay still spams junks to audience faces after all these years, but action fans would acquire some sense of satisfaction.Plot is really hectic as there are too many conveniences throughout the almost three hours span of the movie. It's best not to question how hacking is done since the characters infiltrate high level security as if they merely login to social media, or how they arrive precisely at the right time, neglecting time and space boundary just so scenes can be continued. Dialogues are juvenile bantering at best; it's downright silly even with seasoned veteran actors delivering them. Not to mention the soundtracks and camera angles try so hard to convince audience that each scene is as dramatic as climax of Shakespeare's play.While the plot or motivation can be sketchy, there's over-abundance of action sequence, back to back in a row. There hasn't been a movie that hurls explosions until the brink of exhaustion since, well, the last Transformers flick. It's quite a spectacle and clearly the most polished area of the movie. Movements are more focused as the Transformers looking more fluid. The movie hits its highest point when choreographing complicated acrobatic stunt with both the robots and humans involved. Effects are nicely done with little respite between cities they destroyed and they are translated relatively well with 3D.As one might expect from Transformers, it delivers colossal destruction in spades and little of anything else. At some point the movie lowers the attempt of making the plot plausible in exchange of visual bombardment. Those going for action sci-fi will definitely leave the cinema tired and wobbling with explosion overdose.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

It just feels like Transformers Age Of Extinction learn it lesson and try to improve over the other three and thank the Matrix it does With everything being new so it is pretty much a fresh start and in my opinion this is how Transformers live action should have been done from the get go.We have a new cast of Autobots with Optimus Prime (Voiced by Peter Cullen) and Bumblebee returning with new Autobots Hound (Voiced by John Goodman), Drift (Voiced by Ken Watanabe), Crosshairs (Voiced by John DiMaggio)Along with new Decepticons Galvatron (Voiced by Frank Welker), Stringer our main Transformers Antagonist is Lockdown (Voiced by Mark Ryan)The new human Main Protagonist is Cade Yeager (Played be Mark Wahlberg) a garage inventor and single father to his daughter Tessa Yeager (Played by Nicola Peltz) the secondly Human Protagonist is Shane Dyson (Played by Jack Reynor) The Main Human Antagonist is Harold Attinger (Played by Kelsey Grammar) and his hired gun James Savoy (Played by Titus Welliver). Our other human characters are Joshua Joyce (Played by Stanley Tucci), Darcy Tirrel (Played by Sophia Myles), And Su Yueming (Played by Bingbing Li)What makes this film so much better is the fact the story is more focus on the Transformers which for me as a fan it made it more enjoyable. Yes I know they are some who didn't like the movie but to me it is more than meets the eye and I saw it three times in theaters so that's how much I enjoy this film. Plus Mark and Kelsey's performances were very well balanced they help bring the story to life for the human side of the film and it was cool to have a Transformer as the main antagonist Lockdown is one of the most dangerous villains I ever seen in a film and the voice work Mark did for the character makes him much more feared. Plus his weapons are pretty impressiveAlso the special effects for this movie are top notch as more detail and designs for the Transformers gives them more believable. It just goes to show that C.G.I. can bring a lot of attention to detail and it does that for this film. Plus the comedy was much better in this film than in the other three and it's the kind of comedy I'll take over the other ones I have heard. I mean I was rolling with laughter in the film and everyone in the theater laugh more than everAlso there is some clever lines that came from the film that make you think very creative. It's just so cool to see a Transformers Film that gives more attention to the Transformers Also the protagonists and antagonist of the Humans were more interesting Action scenes in this film are more tense as more powerful as it feels like a rush when you watch the film, music in the film does a awesome job of selling the storyThe only downside to Transformers Age Of Extinction is that some of characters should've been remove from the film because they just took off space also the film was close to three hours long now I have nothing against long movies but that's a long time to watch a film.But overall Transformers Age Of Extinction by far improve so much over the other three and it is one of my favorite films I have seen in theaters and that I own on Blu Ray/DVD and Digital so do yourself a favor leave the negative reviews out and just watch the movie for yourself you might be surprisedI give Transformers Age Of Extinction an 9 out of 10",Transformers - Age of Extinction

75,Howlin Wolf,Franchise Extinction? No such luck!,5,5 September 2017,"Mark Wahlberg is a definite upgrade on Shia LaBeouf, if what you're looking for is a tough, heroic presence... I also like the 'Americana' vibe of the beginning (sunsets over rolling green hills, etc). There are echoes of Ruby Ridge in a Transformers movie, and I'm impressed... but it ultimately comes to nothing. It progressively gets noisier and more cluttered, and my engagement ebbs away.The plot is pretty simple; there's some element (""Transformium"" - very creative!) that the C.I.A want to use to build new tech, and the Decepticons want control of to build an infinite robot army... so when everybody is in place, it's just one giant chase scene to decide whose hands it rests in. Fair enough. ... but why in Einstein's name must it take so long??! Two and three quarter HOURS for a Transformers movie?? That's bordering on a war crime, surely! It's like each movie is in competition with the last over how much unnecessary destruction it can wreak, and how bloated it can be.I'm in a small minority of people who like the movies more, the less robot fights they have in them... All that clanking of metal upon metal? Let's just say that I'd hate to work in a foundry! Robots beating each other up just isn't my bag. I like the alliances, the talk of honour, and the backstory... I just could do without the junkyard scraps!... but then, in the end, the sun sets as the swell of the music rises up... and I think to myself: ""Damnit Bay; you almost had me!"" He knows how to make an epic; it's just a shame that - like an eight year old boy - his idea of substance amounts to banging things together, over and over again!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
76,Screen_Blitz,"It is long, redundant, and and eventually grows numbing, but not without some thrilling special-effects action to go around",5,29 September 2014,"The Transformers have returned, but with just a few new things to the table. One, there are now dinobots, giant robots meant to resemble dinosaurs from the prehistoric age. Two, Shia Labeouf and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley are no longer in the picture. This time around, joining the fight between the giant Autobots and the Decepticons in a loud, raging battle is Mark Wahlberg who leads an all-new cast in yet another addition to Michael Bay's box-office crunching franchise. This fourth installment is just about everything you can expect from a Transformers entry by this point, there is sassy-looking sports car morphing into giant metal monsters, there is an alarming amount of explosions, and there is plenty of destruction to large cities. And for the down side, it is all strung together a shallow plot that falls so short of depth, it's barely even there. By the end, it transcends to an accurate representation of Michael Bay repeating the same mistakes that made the previous two installments only marginally entertaining. Set after the events of 'Dark of the Moon', Chicago has been devastated and the United States government has ended their alliance with the Transformers. Things only get for worse for a struggling inventor Cade Yeager (played by Mark Wahlberg), a widowed father who comes across an old pickup trick and takes it home in hopes of recreating to an all- new invention to sell and raise money for his 17-year old daughter Tessa's (played by Nicole Peltz) college funds. When the old truck reveals to be Optimus Prime (voiced by Peter Cullen) and the FBI holds them hostage, the two along with Cade's business partner Luke (played by T.J Miller) and Tessa's boyfriend Shane (played by Jack Reynor) escape, only to be pulled into a war between the autobots and the decepticons who are in possession of a mysterious weapon that could wipe out mankind.It is near-endless fun for action junkies, particularly teens, who crave eye-dazzling special effects Michael Bay is widely known for. But for those who go in hoping for a coherent plot and dialogue that even remotely hits the funny bone, that is a dream that goes to die. Returning as screenwriter is Ehren Kruger who once again appears to have trouble cooking up a nicely constructed narrative. The story here falls shallow of surprises and relies on loud, bombastic robot- on-robot action set pieces to keep the narrative moving. This strategy would perhaps be less of a problem if the action was more fun. The robot battling sequences are fun for awhile, but before too long they grow a little numbing. The climatic battle which takes place in downtown city of China marks the prime example of Bay indulging in his trademark fetish for loud, grand-scale destruction with building and cars blown to smithereens. Much of this can be entertaining at times, but the plot however, is barely present. The fate of the world is at stake and the autobots become their line of defense, but there is not much emotional depth or interesting characters to keep things compelling for the unnecessary runtime just shy of three hours. On the plus side, Mark Wahlberg does make a pleasant presence in the lead role as does Stanley Tucci as a corporate CEO resembling Steve Jobs. Nicole Peltz on the other hand, isn't given a whole lot to do than to, like many supporting actresses in the franchise, act as eye candy. Jack Reynor as Peltz's Irish boyfriend is fine, but nothing much to speak of. Transformers: Age of Extinction is long, redundant sci-fi action showcase that may have a strong visual heft to keep youngsters occupied, but lacks the narrative touch and direction to make it a compelling adventure. This installment is no game changer and grows rather numbing through its run. Do not go in expecting too much surprises, otherwise you will be gravely disappointed.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
77,cricket30,It's all downhill after the Texas history lesson . . .,6,28 June 2014,". . . since the first 57 minutes of this overly long 165-minute marathon takes place in Texas, but the rest of it is all over the map. It's true that anything subtitled ""Age of Extinction"" certainly BELONGS in ""the Lone Star state."" As ill-fated ""Lucas"" observes early on during this 4th TRANSFORMERS flick, Texas was established originally to OVERTURN the Mexican central government's action in FREEING ITS BLACK SLAVES. Courageous human rights champion Gen. Santa Anna saw his army slaughtered at San Jacinto during the siesta truce on April 21, 1836. The SLAVERS WON, but the NBA still puts its teams in Texas and allows them to win their crown! (Wait till L.A. Clippers owner Donald Silver's lawyers turn up the dirt on this!) Next, we see the streets of a small Texas town filled with indiscriminate artillery fire as Cade Yeager tries to escape the authorities. There was no escape from government tanks for David Koresh (a.k.a., Vernon Wayne Howell) and his 82 fellow Branch Davidians (including 28 kids) on April 14, 1993 in Waco, TX, either. Cade Yeager's assistant (and EXTINCTION's comic relief character) Lucas is offed in a Shadow Government operation reminiscent of President Kennedy's assassination from behind the Grassy Knoll on Nov. 22, 1963 in Dallas, TX, while the subsequent mega-explosion brings to mind what happened on April 16, 1947, in Texas City, TX, when at least 581 folks (more likely, a thousand plus, if you include the incinerated transients and undocumented people) were killed and 1,784 hospitalized when the Grandcamp freighter blew. After this tour of Red Letter events in Texas history, its all downhill for AGE OF EXTINCTION, as the scene shifts first to Chicago and then to Hong Kong (to increase the world box office, obviously). This flick has so many product placements--from Budweiser to Victoria's Secret--that it takes nearly three hours to cram them all in! On a personal note, someone once dared me to visit a place more dangerous than Mexico, so I headed up North to Detroit. The ""Motor City's"" iconic symbol is the two-car ""People Mover"" trains, and their concrete monorail-like elevated tracks. Though EXTINCTION director Michael Bay knows that he could not brazenly transplant San Francisco street cars or London's Big Ben to Hong Kong, apparently he figures that NO ONE HAS BEEN TO DETROIT, so why not have the People Mover in many key scenes during the climax of this film? At the 2:25:10 mark he even drops a ship from a UFO to destroy a two-car People Mover train. Bay may be up on his Texas history, but he sure don't know his Michigan from his Hong Kong!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
78,Troy_Campbell,"Stale, repetitive and unintentionally laughable.",4,27 June 2014,"Where should I start? With the woeful acting? The stupid plot? The repetitive and tiresome robotic melees? How about I begin at the very bottom: fatigue. At a bum-numbing 165 minutes, the longest of the notoriously bloated Transformers pictures, Michael Bay reasserts what many already knew, that he has zero self-control and could benefit from a little lesson in pace-setting editing. The overblown runtime would be less of an issue, however, if it wasn't packed with some of the worst acting this side of Twilight. Mark Whalberg is forced to deliver clunker after clunker as human hero Cade Yeager, Nicola Peltz is atrocious as his daughter Tessa – whose sole purpose is to get tongues wagging with her ludicrously short shorts – and Kelsey Grammar should hang his head in shame as he phones it in as the dull villain who scowls his way through the dialogue. There's a silver lining here though, as the ever-dependable Stanley Tucci stands out as a rare highlight in a comedic role that provides a handful of genuinely humorous moments among the muck. But what about the grand scale action I hear you ask? Well with a budget of approximately $165 million, Bay is once again free to create just about any set piece his child-like mind can conceive while his quantity over quality approach ensures there's certainly no lack of metal on metal smackdowns (or explosions). The problem is the computer-generated battles are stale, muddled and monotonous, to the point where even the inclusion of the fan favourite dinobots adds very little spice. A couple of choice slow motion sequences – including a futuristic-tinged explosion that claims a life and Bumblebee, Optimus Prime and a human trio diving over a multi-level freeway – offer glimpses of how awesome this blockbuster could have been, making it all the more disheartening when it is instead filled with yawn-inducing action, unintentionally laughable performances (Tucci aside) and a plot overrun with continuity errors and holes in the movie's own logic. Even as mindless popcorn entertainment, Age of Extinction fails to succeed and is yet another nail in the Transformers coffin.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
79,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Just as awful as the rest of the franchise.,1,2 November 2016,"Transformers: Age of Extinction is a neo-Nazi's attempt at cashing in on universe-building and international pandering to audiences the world over through its nonsensical moving the final act to China. Michael Bay is still the same racist white supremacist, explosion-obsessed arsehole that the world's grown to hate for rational reasons: because he does movies not out of love, but out of EGO & MONEY!Paramount Pictures has lost a bit of itself through making films like these a reality. They made great films out of The Godfather Part I & Part II with Francis Coppola, and helped mould Superman into what he is today with their 1940s Superman cartoons from Max Fleischer. Now, fast forward to the 21st Century and they're making... Transformers, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and their Star Trek films aren't as big a draw as they used to be. There are rumours that Paramount is auctioning itself to a Chinese company, and you wonder why it's gotten to such a breaking point for the studio... it's because they've lost a lot of their historical self- respect.Transformers 4 is EVERYTHING that's wrong with modern cinema; there's NOTHING good about it, the script awful, the directing atrocious, the acting still atrocious, and underage sex-appeal make this a project brimming with all sorts of evil that nobody should have to tolerate in such a diverse and open film market where ANYONE can pick/cherry-pick better movies instead of watching this crap.Watch Goodfellas, watch The Dark Knight, watch Inception, watch Bicycle Thieves, watch Seven Samurai, Yojimbo, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Once Upon a Time in America, Superman, The Matrix, Metropolis, The King's Speech, Dirty Pretty Things, Interstellar, 2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, Back to the Future, Citizen Kane, Vertigo, Psycho...

There was decent character development with Mark Wahlberg's character and his family. I didn't even miss Sam Witwicky. How anyone can find this movie boring is beyond me. This is easily one of the best in the series. This review will contain spoilers!Wahlberg stars as a struggling Texan inventor named Cade Yeager. He's a single father to Tessa, a teenage girl about to graduate. Cade soon finds an old beat-up truck that happens to be Optimus Prime in hiding.

When the CIA find out about Optimus, Cade, Tessa, and her boyfriend, Shane try to help Optimus. Meanwhile, a corporation called KSI are building their own man-made Autobots made out of a substance they call 'Transforium' and accidentally create a new villain named Galvatron. Optimus and the surviving Autobots must team up with Cade and try to bring down the evil man-made Decepecticons.

81,brchthethird,Why mess with a formula that works?,5,7 October 2014,"By this point, you're either on board with Michael Bay or you're not. Personally, I don't mind his filmmaking style, but it can be very excessive. It goes without saying that this latest installment of the Transformers series has all the hallmarks of a Michael Bay movie. The plot is entirely too complicated, the camera-work is chaotic and leery and of course there is his juvenile (and sometimes pervy) sense of humor. Oh, and lots of super-obvious product placement. Although the story is essentially the same as the previous three, they did throw a few new things in that fans should appreciate. For one, the entire human cast has been replaced. Instead of Shia LeBeouf, we have Mark Wahlberg, who is a marked improvement even if I still don't buy him as a scientist. To do some acting and scenery-chewing, there is Kelsey Grammar as the commander of a CIA black ops unit known as Cemetery Wind, and Stanley Tucci as the founder of a robotics firm who is doing Transformers research and have a special arrangement with the US government. There's also some new Transformers in the mix as well. My personal favorite is Lockdown, a mercenary who is on a mission to capture Optimus Prime. There's also a cool effect where his face turns into a machine gun. On the Autobot side, there is Hound (voiced by John Goodman), Drift (Ken Watanabe) and a third one whose name eludes me right now. They even throw in the Dinobots, although they're only in the last 20-30 minutes of a nearly 3-hour movie. There's even mention of the Transformers' creators, which sets things up for the sequel. If loud, effects-heavy action movies are your thing then you'll probably end up liking this. Still, at 166 minutes it is a little too long. I didn't go in with terribly high expectations and I mostly enjoyed myself. The human story was rather silly and clichéd, but nobody goes and sees these things for that. They go and see them for the Transformers, and in that respect you should be satisfied.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
82,thekarmicnomad,Car crash TV - but not in an interesting way.,3,2 December 2014,"I read transformers comics as a kid and had the toys - but I am not one of those people who get all possessive about their nostalgia. It was time for the next generation to have a go.Poor next generation. What a load of rubbish they were dished up here.The story is absolutely terrible - I do realise this is a story about giant robots fighting each other so I wasn't expecting Shakespeare but this was ridiculous.Plot goes that the transformers are fugitives and all but extinct, then some come back, then the people kill the transformers, then a fight, then some new bad arse ones are made, now the transformers are killing the people, then the bad arse ones turn out to be rubbish, then they aren't, the people are killing the transformers, oh look a giant robot dinosaur that will come in handy, then another fight, then a spaceship thing then credits roll.The film balances shakily on its CGI. Take the affects away and you have no film. The fight scenes are impressive but move so fast you can't really appreciate them and near-miss fatigue sets in fairly quickly. Every time a good guy is likely to get hurt an Autobot jumps in the way and takes the bullit.

84,Bob-45,"Best of the series, which is not much of a compliment",6,1 July 2015,"I find myself watching the Transformers movies because my wife likes these mindless action flicks. I found ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" to be far more bearable than any of the other films in this series and certainly more bearable than the ""G.I. Joe"" franchise and the last two ""Iron Men"" movies. First the good news: 1) The action sequences are actually coherent in this one. 2) No Shia LaBoef. Now, the bad news: 1) Insufferably long 2) The climactic fight sequences are a letdown, given the trans-formative capabilities of the new ""autobots"". 3) No Megan Fox 4) No Rose Huntington-Whitely, either. Definitely, the quotient of female eye-candy has dropped dramatically. The highly touted Bingbing Li is so heavily made up, she looks less real than the worst CGI and her personality is even less realistic. Amazingly, Bingbing purportedly garnered 20 endorsement contracts from this. Oh well, everyone has a right to his own tastes. Fortunately, John Goodman graces us with his great humor and booming voice, making the seemingly endless action sequences a lot more bearable; and Michael Bay keeps the camera moving enough to keep the convoluted storyline from feeling it is unfolding at a snail's pace; which, unfortunately, it is. I give ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" a ""6"".",Transformers - Age of Extinction
85,RforFilm,Too Much is Meeting The Eye Here! Transformers: Age of Extinction is Overlong and Self-Indulgent,2,27 June 2014,"How is it that the Transformers franchise has gone from being a popular Japanese toy line into some of the most Americana of movies? I think it's safe to say that every little boy at one point has played with a Transformers toy. It's a winning combination; they get the ability to use the cars and trucks as racing toys while they can turn it into a fighting robot. But do these kids really follow some sort of story as they play? Not really. Most of the time, they just pretend that their fighting each other. Smash, boom, the world is saved, they move on to the next toy. Why do I bring this up? This is the formula that Michael Bay follows when making the live action movies.I never thought that any of the Transformers movies were technically good movies (though the first was at least fun) as they all contain similar overlong running times, stories that seem forget logic, and loud battles that go on longer then both World Wars! It's pretty obvious that we don't come in to Transformers for an intellectual conversation, but I do expect something that's at least fun. Transformers: Age of Extinction does not define what a fun blockbuster should be. Gone are Shia LaBeouf and the military point of view. Instead, we have a robotics inventor Cade Yeager (played by Mark Wahlberg) in Texas who does his best to provide for his teenage daughter Tessa (played by Nicola Peltz). He purchases a rusty truck that he tries to fix, only to find out that he's discovered Optimus Prime, the leader of the autobot creatures from the previous movies. He learns that after the Chicago war of the last movie, the CIA has started to hunt all aliens on earth, regardless if their good autobots or evil decepticons. Speaking of which, CIA agent Harold Attinger (played by Kelsey Grammar) discovers Optimus' location and goes after Cade and his daughter. They manage to escape the government forces thanks to Optimus and Tessa's boyfriend Shane (played by Jack Reynor).Optimus calls out the few autobots left including Bumblebee and Hound (played by John Goodman) to discuss finding out what's happened to their robot brothers. They make their way over to KSI, a successful robotics corporation, to find that the rest of the autobots have been dismantled so that the company's head Joshua Joyce (played by Stanley Tucci) can make his own transformers. This includes a reborn decepticon, in the previous movies known as Megatron, now Galvatron.I'm gonna stop there, because there's only so much exposition I can talk about. I think that I liked this better then two and three, but that's not saying much. Transformers: Age of Extinction manages to make the same mistakes from before, also overlong at nearly three hours and battle scenes never want to end. The best way to describe all of the Transformers movies is like going to a loud party. At first, you do get into the over the top attitudes of everyone and their actions, but you eventually want to leave that party to do something else. Transformers just doesn't know when to end. Most kids won't have the patience to sit through a movie that long, even if robot fights are all that came for.Now are the robot fights good? A lot of them do have some inspired moments of creativity, especially when the dinobots come it. Just seeing Optimus Prime riding a fire breathing metal T- rex was cool. But as I've said, the battles go on and on, where I got to the point of nearly nodding off. That's right, becoming sleepy when there are giant robots in front of me. Surprisingly, the best moments come not from the action, but from our leading actors. Mark Wahlberg, Kelsey Grammar, and Stanley Tucci are fun to watch, bringing plenty of charisma. They all are in of the film's goofy nature, and play goofy characters themselves. They even get in some really good laughs. I would have been fine to write this off as enough the recommend this, but WHY DOES THIS NEED TO BE NEARLY THREE HOURS!!!I'll give this two autobot logos out of ten. I can tell just on the tone that Michael Bay is getting sick of these Transformer movie and maybe we out to call it quits from this point or at least shorten it to an hour and a half; that all anyone really wanted in the first place.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
86,ivo-cobra8,"The biggest and the worst ""Transformers"" movie yet!!!!",1,8 November 2015,"*SPOILERS*Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014) is a big disappointment, my god, what a boring movie, almost 3 hours, the only saving grace is the excellent picture and sound!!!! I like the 1st and 3rd movies but this just drags and drags one. The film is simply the worsts of the quadrilogy so far. Dinobots? You got to be serious! I love Transformers (2007) and Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) to death!!! I like a bit Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, but this movie is the worst boring movie in the series ever! Gosh 3.hrs long movie I have fall a sleep by that time. I watch only twice and I want watch it anymore. Awful, horrible, terrible, messy, pathetic and tedious are just a few words I would use to describe this movie. I mean I love the Transformers movies sure their ridiculous and dumb but their just so much fun and they have some of the best action sequences. However ""Age of Extinction"" is the worst one yet it's even worst than ""Revenge of the Fallen"" the movie is almost 3 hours long and the story is completely incoherent. Every character is stiff and completely unlikeable. There's no explanation on what happened to Sam, his girlfriend, parents or the other Autobots from the last film. The story makes no sense at all. The plot changes every hour and it's awfully exhausting and confusing. The action sequences are shorter and less exciting. It's not even fun it's so overly serious without any humor. Worst of all it's feels so empty without Shia LeBeouf I like Mark Wahlberg, but he doesn't have the humor and emotion that Shia brought to these films. I could go on and on, but even by Michael Bay standards this is horrible film that's a waste of time and money. From director Michael Bay and executive producer Steven Spielberg comes the worst 'Transformers' ever! With humanity facing extinction from a terrifying new threat, it's up to Optimus Prime and the Autobots to save the world. But now that our government has turned against them, they'll need a new team of allies, including inventor Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) and the fearsome Dinobots!I am giving this film 1/10 sorry if you disagree with me, but that is just my opinion and the fourth Transformer movie sucks!!! I am a big fan of Transformers I grew up with transformers cartoons, this movie the most long over boring lacking, awful film! This movie completely ignores all the previous three films, there are no Deceptions in this film no Megatron a big nothing is in here! + this movie was not enjoyable at all it wasn't.

87,fernandoschiavi,"For Michael Bay, what matters is the visual spectacle. The bigger the explosions and the shorter the actresses' shorts, the better",6,26 May 2020,"""Age of extinction"" is a kind of reboot of the franchise, being a sequence of ""Transformers: The Dark of the Moon"", after 3 years of the events in Chicago. It is the first feature of the series that does not have the participation of Shia LaBeouf, main actor in the first three, and has a completely renewed cast, with the exception of five robots: Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Brains, Ratchet and Megatron (now in the form modified to Galvatron).A few years after the great confrontation between Autobots and Decepticons in Chicago, the giant alien robots disappeared. They are currently hunted by humans, who do not want to be in trouble again. When Cade (Mark Wahlberg) finds an abandoned truck, he could never imagine that the vehicle is actually Optimus Prime, the leader of the Autobots. Much less that, in helping to bring him back to life, Cade and his daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) would be targeted by the American authorities.Before getting into these equal elements, though, let's look at the differences in Age of extinction. Ehren Kruger, responsible for the ""script"" of the two previous works, returns to the same position looking for a kind of reinvention of the mythology of the series. We saw the insertion of creators of the Transformers, who only appear at a glance, but are mentioned throughout the plot. With that in mind, the opening minutes of the projection take us to a prehistoric Earth, revealing that the extinction of the dinosaurs was, in fact, caused by alien beings. A cut, then, takes the work to the present, where researchers discover a frozen robotic dinosaur. Here we could expect a repetition of the first film, with the awakening of Megatron, but the text decides to insert this pleonasm in an even less creative way. The tyrannosaurus robot is overlooked for most of the work.In the United States, on the other hand, one of the criticisms of the previous film was that the city of Chiacago was practically entirely destroyed, without any consequence for the residents of the city. Michale Bay, as always, was only concerned with destroying everything. In this fourth part of the franchise, we see that the tragedy generated commotion among the Americans and the Transformers came to be seen as threats. Even the Autobots, allied to the humans, became targets of the CIA's relentless hunt. However, despite its promising start it was soon lost amid explosions, destroyed cities and empty characters. The exchange of Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) by Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) changes little in the story, the character remains just a piece there in the middle, a lever to activate the flame of Optimus Prime, the eternal hero of the day, and greater focus of the film. After the death of the maternal figure, Cade and his teenage daughter Tessa (the beautiful Nicola Peltz) try to live together, despite the differences between them. A specialist in robotics, Cade tries to extract from his repairs and inventions the sustenance of his home, without success. In one of his negotiations, he comes across an old truck and decides to take it to the ""laboratory"". Little does he know that the old can is none other than the leader of the Autobots and that his problems are just beginning. Here, the script tires the viewer through a completely unnecessary subplot between father, daughter, Tessa Yeager (Nicola Peltz) and her boyfriend, Shane (Jack Reynor). Unintelligible and predictable jokes occupy the many minutes that see such interactions on screen, already building the biggest of the work's problems.It is also worth mentioning Stanley Tucci (from The Hunger Games) and Kelsey Grammer (from X-Men: The Final Showdown) as the illustrious time to pay mico in the series, a position occupied in the previous features by John Turturro and John Malkovich, but here with less embarrassment. As Joshua Joyce, Tucci is a scientist who develops a technology that makes it possible to create Transformers. Grammer, for his part, is Harold Attinger, a veteran agent who coordinates the hunt for the Autobots. However, absolutely none of this saves the production of sameness.
The new cast, as much as they bring a new story and, in certain cases, even different characteristics, are only brief distractions for what really matters: the battles between robots. They are mere knickknacks that are only there to give the film the human element, essential for there to be some thread of identification in this context. In light of this, it does not matter how bizarre it is to see a Mark Wahlberg broken into playing a robot creator or that a rally driver hired by Red Bull is hiding in the countryside of Texas, in the middle of nowhere. Coherence, what for in a Transformers movie? As it could not be otherwise, the film suffers from the exact same filming problems as its previous ones. Shaky cameras, frantic montage and lack of creativity in the design of the creature's mix, creating a complete visual mess. The repetition also extends to the script when we realize the complete irrelevance of the villain within the plot, which had already presented an effective antagonist. The feeling left is the old attempt to insert even more action scenes in a feature film that already has an exaggerated number of them. When we arrive at two o'clock, all we can do is look at the clock in desolation and see that there are still 45 minutes of CGI overdose. Michael Bay proves, once again, with Ehren Kruger, that they can't do anything different and even a reboot proposal is more like a remake. The few qualities of the work are completely overshadowed by its marked defects. The incredible thing is that such bizarre situations present in the series' scripts are so ingrained in their core that now Michael Bay himself plays with them. That's what happens when Optimus Prime is found inside an abandoned cinema - in fact, how a truck ended up in a cinema ... forget it! - And the former owner of the place complains that it was good in the old days, when they were making real films, that now only half-bowl sequences and remakes were made (a sign of irony turned on!). Or when Stanley Tucci's character, full of delicious debauchery, jokes in the elevator about being chased by giant robots and CIA agents who wanted to kill him and still have an alien artifact with the potential of a nuclear warhead in hand. - all of this in Beijing, it's good to stress! That is, the absurdities are already part of what is expected from a film in the franchise.""Age of extinction"" makes the same mistakes as ""Revenge of the Fallen"" and ""The Dark of the Moon"". More explosions than it should, while new robots are presented in a shallow and flawed way, being used with a sloppy appearance in production. Coherence does not exist and old characters are ignored, while the past is used only around the events that are used to build the new pursuit. One of the main defects of this film and of the whole series is the long duration of the editing. It's almost three hours, which results in an incredible amount of unnecessary twists and some false endings. The constant search for a bigger battle than the previous one is too tiring. For all this, the only way to leave the cinema quietly after so much flying towards you is to recline the seat and try not to think too much. As much as you like to see robots fighting each other on the big screen, this dramatically reduces any impact that the film could cause.This is even more serious for those who have seen the previous features, since the effects, especially the transformation of vehicles into robots, are no longer impressive. Robot dinosaurs are amazing and visually stylish, featuring an interesting variety of ""species"". But their origin is so poorly explained that many people leave the room without understanding why they appeared or how Optimus Prime ""domesticated"" them. Once again, I remember: it's Transformers, that is, any kind of logic goes far from the idea that the writers have for the series. Autobots are more and more beautiful and well rendered, much more organic than in previous films, real living beings. And the highlight goes to its diversity, never explored before. We have a Samurai Autobot, Bumblebee has a more ""ninja"" aspect, and there is an Autobot that mixes something between a war general and a bearded dwarf, who even smokes a cigarette made with a bullet shell. It remains for Michael Bay, director of the previous features, to juggle with the camera (something he knows very well how to do), to generate some adrenaline. As in the previous film, specifically, 3D also deserves to be highlighted. In addition to the ""items flying from the screen"", we have interesting depth work, creating layers in the visual and making the visual experience much more immersive, something very interesting for the film.For Michael Bay, what matters is the visual spectacle. The bigger the explosions and the shorter the actresses' shorts, the better. ""Age of extinction"" is superior to the second film, Revenge of the Fallen, but inferior to the first Transformers and also to The Hidden Side of the Moon. The well-balanced humor of the original is missing and the grandeur of the third. For those who are fans of the series, it doesn't matter: they will see you and probably love you - the basic rules of the formula are there, don't forget. Strange as it may seem, the bright spot in Age of extinction is Mark Wahlberg. With characteristics of action hero, his character, Cade Yeager, is much more interesting than the dull Sam Witwicky of Shia LaBeouf, protagonist of the previous films. Too bad Cade has arrived now, when the series seems to have so little to offer. A change in direction might be a solution to give the franchise a new lease of life.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

90,swilliky,A goofy action film with dazzling special effects but poor dialogue and ridiculous plotting,3,24 June 2017,"The fourth movie in the Transformers series delves even further into Earth's history and introduces a new main character. Michael Bay continues his unique style of action spectacle directing though the target audience appears to be more international. Before humanity, the Transformers visited and wiped out dinosaurs. A discovery in Artic by the explorer Darcy (Sophia Myles) shows signs of their early presence. In Texas, Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) discovers a strange truck while salvaging junk from a movie theater with his assistant Lucas (T.J. Miller). Cade's daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) can't get a scholarship to college and the family is in financial trouble. In Chicago, Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammar) coordinates an operation that sends a task force to hunt down Transformers led by James Savoy (Titus Welliver). The transformer they cooperate with, Lockdown, does not discriminate between Autobots and Decepticons.Cade discovers the truck is actually Optimus Prime who had been trapped by humans and forced into hiding. Attinger sends Savoy and the Transformer hunters to Texas to investigate the truck sighting. They use brutal tactics on the Yeagers until Optimus bursts out of the barn and Shane Dyson (Jack Reynor), Tessa's boyfriend, drives in to help them escape. In the ensuing chase, Shane shows off his driving skills and Lucas gets vaporized. Cade does not approve of Shane dating Tessa and investigates the BlackOps organization that attacked him. Optimus updates his look and assembles the remaining autobots, including Bumblebee. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Transformers - Age of Extinction
91,bryank-04844,'Transformers: Age of Extinction' is just a horrendous mess of a film from top to bottom.,1,15 August 2015,"It seems like a lot of years have passed since then, because Chicago looks completely rebuilt, only to be destroyed once again. But Bay has cast a whole new group of characters. He threw out Shia LaBeouf, Megan Fox and the others and replaced them with Mark Wahlberg, a couple of no-names, Stanley Tucci, and Kelsey Grammar. So it's a brand new day in a world where 'Transformers' are being hunted by a secret military operation uncanonized to the President or anyone else for that matter for the cliché'd reason of money. Without a single shot lasting more than seven seconds (even the slow motion ones), we center on Wahlberg who plays Cade Yeager, a single father, raising a teenage daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz), on their Texas farm, as he tries to come up with the next big electrical invention.His barn is a makeshift lab where he has invented dozens of different robots who have trouble performing the most simple tasks. You would thing that this plot point would come into play later, as he is good at working with metal and robots, but believe me, it doesn't pay off nor come into play at all. Wahlberg's right-hand man is Lucas (T.J. Miller), who is the comic relief here, but I guess Bay received so much flack for his lack of of comedic dialogue in the previous films, that he blows up the comedic relief early on the film, leaving the rest of the film at a much darker tone than the three previous movies. When Cade is not telling his 17-year old daughter that she can't date anyone or have fun, he is purchasing some equipment and comes across a rusted out old 18 wheeler, which turns out to be a beat up Optimus Prime. Cade and Optimus become friends, but the CIA and their new ally Lockdown, a mercenary Transformer who is up for the task for taking out all Autobots in exchange for a seed, or bomb that can destroy a planet in order to create life for more Transformers, is one of our bad guys here.So for the next two hours, Cade, Tessa, and Tessa's secret 20-year old race car driving boyfriend Shane (Jack Reynor), are on the run from the CIA and Lockdown with Optimus Prime and a few other remaining auto-bots. We go from Texas to Chicago to Beijing, all of which are mostly destroyed by the ensuing fight scenes which are redundant and the same thing you've seen in the previous three movies, with the exception of the Dino-Bots making an appearance in the last few minutes of the movie. If you thought Megatron was dead, think again. CIA head operator Harold Attinger (Grammer) and billionaire inventor Joshua Joyce (Tucci) are in cahoots with each other to take out the auto-bots by taking the remnants of Megatron and learning how to build their own Transformers from scratch. But little do they know that Megatron is still alive and is now controlling the 50 new Transformers that Joyce built.So it seems like Cade and his teenage daughter have a lot on their plates to deal with at the moment. Cade turns into an alien-gun wielding action hero while his daughter acts like a horrible person for most the movie by yelling at her dad and trying to make out with her older boyfriend in front of him, but gets to jump off a truck and kick a small goofy transformer with googly eyes once. Bay just seems to hate women as he has never had a decent female character in any of his movies, but just likes to show them wearing next to nothing through the entire film, which is how Cade's daughter dresses throughout.The script is utter garbage with cheesy one-liner after cheesy-one liner, spewing from each actor throughout the 165 minutes. I've seen better dialogue on day-time soap operas, but I guess that's what you get when you hire writer Ehren Kruger ('Scream 3'). Is there anything good about this movie? Not really, but seeing it in IMAX, was pretty good, and the 3D didn't make me want to gouge my eyes out. I'd say the best part of the film was Stanley Tucci. His character is the only one that has a solid story arc and is fun to watch on screen. His frantic dialogue and expressions are very funny, but it is all short lived and happens too often.Whalberg is always likable and it was good to see him here, but there wasn't really anything his character had other than clichés and bad lines. And Tessa and Reynor could have been played by anyone at anytime, as their performances were forgettable and lazy. At least Bay cast John Goodman as one of the auto-bots and we got to hear Bumblebee say a John Goodman line from 'The Big Lebowski', but other than that, every thing else was sub-par, even John DiMaggio, yes Bender from 'Futurama' is an auto-bot in this movie. I'm sure 'Age of Extinction' will make tons of money this summer, but it's a shame, because it definitely doesn't deserve it.This is filmmaking at its worse, with terrible camera work, awful dialogue, bad characters, a bad musical score, and enough blatant product placement to make your throw up. Sure, the editors found a way to take Michael Bay's ridiculous style of filmmaking and turn the action scenes into something tolerable, but it barely works, and with it happening constantly for three hours, it becomes silly and annoying. The IMAX image and sound is amazing, but past that, 'Transformers: Age of Extinction' is just a horrendous mess of a film from top to bottom.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
92,petarmatic,Visually stunning but low on substance.,6,10 December 2014,"I saw too many of the sci fi thrillers/horrors like this one. I have to be critical about the whole thing since I did not see much of a story in this one. I have to grade it a little bit lower then I grade usually these types of films just because what I mentioned above.I think if you like these types of films you can have some fun, also young teenagers also can have some fun during their dates while making out on the love seats.Otherwise, I would not waste too much time on this if you are not a fan of these types of films. It might be boring for you and you could walk out in the middle of film or throw away your DVD in a garbage can.All in all I was bored while watching it except that I really enjoyed visual effects.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
93,jdkraus,Preconceived notions should not be considered for this movie,7,8 July 2014,"Before even one considers writing a review for ""Transformers: Age of Extinction,"" one must understand its director. Michael Bay is the master of disaster; big explosions, car chases, city-sized destruction, and abundance of CGI. Stereotypes, loud music, hot girls, and juvenile humor make their way into his films too. He is a filmmaker that cannot direct any genre other than action with a commercial, visual style. This is what he knows and loves. In result, all his movies are the same. Unfortunately, many people, especially the big critics, do not like his films, most likely because of this reason. People may also roll their eyes and despise this movie because it is another ""Transformers"" film. I agree that ""Revenge of the Fallen"" and ""Dark of the Moon"" were not as great as the first one. Yet, that is not a reason to overlook ""Age of Extinction.""The plot is not so much a reboot as it is a new opening for another trilogy. Five years following the Battle of Chicago, the Transformers are targeted and terminated by the government, led by a xenophobic CIA man (Kelsey Grammar) and his twisted henchman (Titus Welliver). They plan on not only exterminating the Transformers, but also rebuilding them with their own modifications from a Steve Jobs knockoff (Stanley Tucci). The pivotal force centers on Cade Jeager (Mark Wahlberg), an unsuccessful robot constructor and a single parent, who so happens to buy an old, beat-up semi-truck only to discover that it is no other than Optimus Prime. The paths between government and Autobots cross and Jaeger with his daughter are caught in the middle of an adventure so perilous that it could end all things as they know it. What works well for ""Age of Extinction"" is its story. It is new, fresh, and a break from Shia LeBeouf. There are many plots, subplots, and at the end of it all, there is a good cliffhanger for an impending sequel. The story itself is darker in tone. From the get-go, the villains are cruel and heartless, particularly when they blow the Autobot Ratchet to pieces. It's unpredictability with characters sets the film up as a thrill ride versus a hardcore action flick.The cast is another improvement. While I can't say Wahlberg turns in his best performance (he has more or less played the same character for years), he makes an effective protagonist. Unlike his predecessor, he does not run around for two and a half hours screaming. Rather, he joins in the fight, kicking butt and destroying bad guys. Grammar and Welliver are good villains that don't fit the typical cookie-cutter baddies. Reasons are given for their course of actions. Stanley Tucci delivers great comedy and pompousness as a tech-savvy billionaire way in over his head. Even the voice talent for the Transformers are well done and appropriately fit the personalities of their characters. Peter Cullen is once again the fearless leader Optimus. Ken Watanabe is the honorable samurai Drift and John Goodman is the smart-mouthed, rotund Hound. Mark Ryan as the villain Lockdown makes a formidable foe. His voice alone enunciates an antagonist. The only real bad performances in this movie are Nicole Peltz and Jack Reynor as the teen lovers Tessa and Shane. Their characters are shallow and Reynor's supposed Irish accent comes and goes just as badly as Mel Gibson's Scottish accent in ""Braveheart."" The prowess of this movie though lies in the VFX team. While CGI will probably never reach true photo-realistic detail, the combination between live action and computer effects are amazing. The particle effects of debris are incredible and the transformer transformations are slowed down enough for the viewer to take in every detail of their morphing. The cinematography is something to admire. One shot in particular has Lockdown walking down from his ship, towards Optimus Prime for a death match. The symmetry, colors, and saturations are simply breathtaking. ""Age of Extinction"" is certainly an improvement but it is not at a masterful level.Some of the suspension of disbelief is pushed beyond its limits. Other elements in the story are rushed and merely glanced over. The sexual innuendos are unnecessary (as they were in the first three movies). Luckily though they are kept to a minimum, but enough to make me groan. And as mentioned, I was not impressed with the performances of Jack Reynor and Nicole Peltz. Both were hired for their looks than their acting capacities. Not the best, but this is a good, entertaining Transformer movie. I will be in line for number 5 when it comes out in theaters.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
94,Carycomic,Let's list the pros and cons.,7,29 June 2014,"Okay; first, a con. There was no Shia LeBeauf--or even Megan Fox--to provide any continuity with the first three films. Just relative newcomer Nicola Peltz (well, I've never heard of her before!) as the daughter and only child of Mark Wahlberg's character.Now, a pro. She did a credible enough job as Tessa Yeager that I might go see her next flick. By that, I mean that, sometimes, her character was admirably feisty. Other times; intolerably spoiled-bratty. In short; totally believable as a teenage Texan tomboy.Next; another con. Mark Wahlberg as Old Man Yeager. Why is a robotics engineer, in West Texas, trying-but-failing to be a farmer? Did he used to be employed at the Houston branch of NASA, prior to the Battle of Chicago in T3: DARK OF THE MOON? Some further background info, along those lines (other than he got Tessa's mother pregnant while they were still barely out of high school), would have been helpful! Now, another pro. Kelsey Grammar was colossally brilliant as CIA xenophobe Ettinger. Almost, too convincing, in fact! But, then again; that's the hallmark of a versatile character actor. Isn't it? Now, a third con. This was not quite as good as the first three films, in that Bumblebee and Ratchet were the only familiar Autobot faces. Hound, Crosshairs, and Drift? As totally new to me as Ms. Peltz.Now, a third pro. The action sequences were way better than those in the series premiere of THE LAST SHIP!I guess the only way to break this tie is to list...two more pros!One being the revelation that the Transformers were not always sentient robots. But, rather, they were first invented by _organic_ alien beings. And, the other?The return of Megatron! In summary, then: this is the best movie you'll see before the Fourth of July weekend. And, if you watch it with enough suspended disbelief, the three-hour running time will be well worth sitting through.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

The plot is not ideal and casting Mark Wahlberg wasn't an inspired choice. I still don't understand this storyline and I've seen this 3 times since release. Transformers was on a steady decline after the first film, with only Dark Side of the Moon providing a slight glimmer of hope. Unsure why they thought such a mind numbing film was necessary.

98,Darkside-Reviewer,Wahlberg Explosions!,6,14 October 2020,"I was a huge fan of Transformers growing up in the late 80s and early 90s watching the cartoon series and collecting almost all of the action figures. Then years later as an adult it was announced Transformers was getting a live action movie so naturally I was excited to finally see my favourite Autobots and Decepticons on the big screen fighting and transforming into awsome vehicles and weapons. I went to see Transformers (2007) on opening day and it was a load of rubbish and it only got worse with each sequel. Then when the awful Shia LaBeouf trilogy finally ended I was looking forward to the franchise going in a new direction thus Transformers: Age of Extinction was made.I have only recently gotten around to watching Transformers: Age of Extinction due to the fact that upon release it got bad reviews and quickly ended up in on the bargain shelf at my local movie store.I surprising enjoyed this Transformers movie I mean it's by no means a masterpeice of cinema or anything but compared to the previous Transformer movies it's certainly a step in the right direction for the franchise.The main parts of the movie I enjoyed were of course the action scenes which look amazing and show off the much better CGI effects than in the previous movies. This being a Michael Bay film though there are a few too many explosions throughout the movie but considering the fact that it's a Transformers movie it's to be expected at this point. The fights between the Transformers are actually pretty cool and are full of swords, guns, grenades and of course metal fists. There's also some pretty cool looking dinobots in this movie which have some interesting designs the only downside to the dinobots however is now the Autobots look like the Power Rangers going into battle with their Megazords.The list of things I didn't like about this movie is sadly at lot longer than the things I did like. The first issue I have with this movie are the human characters Mark Wahlberg's character is enjoyable and has some genuinely funny and badass moments however he is followed around by his teenage daughter and her boyfriend throughout the entire movie. The teenage daughter is the most annoying and unnecessary character in the entire film her only purpose in this movie is to be eye candy for teenager boys all she does is get captured and complain. The teenage daughters boyfriend is also a completely pointless character I guess he was added in mainly so Mark Wahlberg's character isn't alone in the action scenes till the other side characters show up but other than that he serves no real purpose in this movie other than to annoy people with his fake Irish accent.The second issue I have with this movie is just how ridiculously implausible some scenes are I get that this is supposed to be just a science fiction action movie about robots from outer space but it's the small things that often ruin what could of been a great scene. The two things I kept noticing consistently throughout the movie is no matter what happens to the characters they manage to keep perfect hair and makeup aswell as not having an inch of sweat on them dispite the fact that they wear the same clothes for days and get into ridiculously over the top battles and spend most of the movie physically running at full speed. Mark Wahlberg's character is meant to be a scrap inventor who collects old junk but he looks like the most jacked up, clean and well dressed hillbilly in existence same with his daughter she puts on lipstick at the start of the movie and by the end it's still on her lips without so much as a smudge.I lost count of how many times the main characters should have died throughout the entire movie. They survive everything from explosions, car crashes, fire, gun fire, being inside a Transformer while he transforms, falling into a Transformers hand from fifty foot drops like it's a safety net. They just walk away from every battle without so much as a scratch on them if you took a shot of alcohol everytime Mark Wahlberg should of died you'd die from alcohol poisoning.The movie also has way too many plots and side plots going on all at once this movie is over two and a half hours long and it manages to cram in three different main story plot lines aswell as ton of pointless side plots that are unnecessary and boring.The last thing I will say about this movie is that I personally felt that it is just too long after two and a half hours of explosions and Mark Wahlberg you can't wait for the movie to end they could of done us all a favour and cut out all the filler and the pointless side characters and made this movie an hour and forty minutes of action that would of been more than enough.I recommend watching this Transformers movie at least once it definitely has it's flaws but compared to the previous movies it's at least an enjoyable action movie that manages to deliver on it's promise of explosions and robot fights.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
99,griffolyon12,A Spoiler-Free Review,8,28 June 2014,"Another Summer, another Transformers movie. There seems to be a new one of these every other Summer, but there and again, there are few filmmakers alive who know how to make Summer movies quite like Michael Bay can. I mean, look, Transformers: Age of Extinction wont win any Oscars for its story, acting, or direction, but you don't watch these movies for that. You watch these Transformers movies to see childhood dreams realized on the bigscreen, and if that doesn't sound interesting to you, then you wont like this movie. However, I did.Age of Extinction is not necessarily a reboot of the franchise, but more of a new start. It is a sequel to the previous three films, but it does not feature any of the same cast of characters, save for the Autobot heroes of Optimus Prime and Bumblebee. One of the smart things this film does in terms of story, is it uses the repercussions of everything that happened in the previous three films to dictate where the story goes. After Chicago was nearly destroyed in the last film, the government has started hunting down all of the Transformers, good and bad, to get them off of our planet before their war destroys us. This story is much darker than previous entries in the franchise, with less humor (which is a welcome change after the too jokey Revenge of the Fallen), but this film is always an entertaining thrill ride from start to finish. Sure, the human characters are merely there for exposition and to create an emotional anchor for the audience, but Mark Wahlberg's movie star charisma keeps the human portions of the film rolling even if he isn't all that sellable as a struggling inventor. The true reason you see these Transformers movies is to see big action on a large scale, and this film does not disappoint. There are explosions, tons of robots fighting robots, and loads of car chases, to sate the appetite of anyone looking for a big, loud Summer movie. This is what Michael Bay does best, and sure, it probably wont ever win him an Academy Award or critical recognition, but it can't take away the fact that he is one of the most talented action movie directors to ever live. With every Michael Bay film, you can look at the screen and see every dollar that was spent on the movie. While some movies, when you hear they were made for $200 million, you are left wondering where that money went, however that is not the case with Michael Bay movies. With Michael Bay, you see that dollar sign reflected in the carnage on screen and then some. Say what you will about him as a director, but at the very least, he knows what he does well, and he sticks to it to continue entertaining audiences. But getting back to the film at hand, the main question most people have about this film is whether or not it's better than the other Transformers movies? Not really. If you liked the previous three movies, then you will love Age of Extinction. Okay, so the story often makes very little sense, but if you've already learned to go with the nonsensical in these films, it wont feel any different. The best thing I can say, is that this is a good Summer blockbuster that I had fun with. While I still think the best Transformers movie is the first one from 2007, I also feel that there is still untapped potential in this franchise. I think these films try to often do too much in one movie, and in so doing, character and emotion are often lost. However, at this point, any Transformers film on a smaller, more character-oriented scale, would probably be rejected by audiences, so you take what you can get, and what you get is still fun.I give Transformers: Age of Extinction an 8 out of 10!",Transformers - Age of Extinction

102,Laakbaar,Soporific,5,28 June 2014,"I went to see this movie with my 14-year-old nephew and his friend. These are kids who grew up with the Transformers franchise and understand it through and through. I noticed that they watched the entire thing with a certain amount of enthusiasm and rapt attention. When they came out, they said it was an OK movie but too long. They said they missed Shia. They loved the cigar-champing bot.On the other hand, I found this to be yet another example of Hollywood's latest slew of city-destruction movies, and I found it difficult to follow. It was the usual blur of fast movement, destruction, special effects, epic clashes, chasing, shooting, and so on. Yawn. I am simply not into this robotic world. I drifted in and out of sleep for the middle hour. When I was able to focus again, not much seemed to have happened. I was dismayed when hour 3 started and there was no sign of a denouement. I hated the cigar-champing bot. It was all so American and so Hollywood. Yuck. Why the dinosaur bot? I didn't get it and didn't care. This is like the fifth movie I've seen in a year with a giant lizard destroying cities. It's too much.There was some pompous philosophising at the end, which seemed utterly pointless drivel given the artifice and existential meaninglessness of this franchise. This movie struck me as full of itself and unabashedly going for the kind of sensation that 14-year-old boys crave in a movie. If you're over the age of 22 or so, I wouldn't bother seeing this one.I have to give it some kind of score because it is really quite astonishing what they can do with CGI nowadays. However, this movie is proof that even this technical artistry can be soporific in the right situation. I have to give it a low score because it put me to sleep. And this is my review, not my nephew's.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

104,Rickting,If you don't like Transformers don't go and see it. Then maybe they'll stop getting made,4,20 December 2014,"We all know the Transformers formula: Scripts with the mentality of a 5 year old, awful directing, terrible acting, sexism, screaming, racism, political conspiracy, robot battles and a neverending stream of explosions which are more exhausting than exhilarating. Interestingly, this grotesquely overlong film (165 minutes) is the same length as Boyhood, which was out at the same time, yet Boyhood, which had no explosions or car chases, made 165 minutes vanish. Transformers Age Of Extinction is set several years after Dark Of The Moon. A mechanic, played by Mark Wahlberg who should have been the main human character from the start, finds Optimus Prime and a confusing and unmemorable plot follows involving political conspiracy and an alien war. Don't be fooled and think Michael Bay has actually learnt anything from previous instalments. This is what many expected: An artificial money making machine with appeal only for fans of explosives, and Michael Bay is still a rubbish director who if there was any justice in the world would be on a demolition team.However, TAOE is not the worst film in the franchise. The first Transformers is OK, but this and the third one aren't terrible movies, but they are pretty bad. Transformers 2 is undoubtedly and undeniably one of the worst films ever made. Mark Wahlberg is better than Shia LaBeouf. Stanley Tucci is excellent. The CGI is undeniably excellent. Some of the action is enjoyable. There is the occasional nice looking shot. Aside from that, we all know what to expect. Basically, if you don't like it, don't watch it. Then maybe at long last we'll stop getting these awful explosion fests ever other year. I certainly hope so. Not a terrible film, but just an exhausting and confusing one that isn't enough fun for a blockbuster. With a lame script, disappointing action sequences which aren't actually that much fun and Nicola 'The Last Airbender' Peltz in a leading role, it's clear all those who make the Transformers films (Not just Michael Bay) haven't learnt anything from previous instalments. Just another artificial money making machine then.4/10",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Yes, things are perennially blown up with a voracious appetite for explosions and noises that we didn't ever think could get any bigger than what Bay had previously demonstrated in the past. Yes, there are more than a few moments where the script gets downright silly, and the plot-holes are just too large to ignore. And, yes, the movie is most certainly a good 45 minutes longer than what it should have been, and seems to drag a fraction in scenes where not much action happens. But at the end of the day, the ridiculous amount of CGI effects, the acting from Wahlberg (as bankable as ever), and Bay's penchant to deliver everything Bay come together to save the day, and even succeed in entertaining us to a degree that was surprisingly greater than expected.""Transformers: Age of Extinction is a pure, no-holds-barred, adrenalin- fueled, laid-back, by-the-numbers, non-taxing, in-your-face, popcorn- munching, quintessential Michael Bay style action blockbuster.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
107,bheadher,A Poor Attempt to resurrect the Transformers universe...,4,18 December 2016,"I can understand why they dismissed all the actors from the other movies, especially Shia LeBeouf (such a jerk now), but did they really think one named star would save this story???While almost totally trashing the original Transformers concept, they apparently thought creating new auto-bots was a cool idea, and WITH FACES and human expressions too, just to deliver all the supposedly funny lines in the movie (wasn't a funny line in there)...Does it get any worse, yes it does...in fact, so many things were wrong with this outing that I.m rather certain there will never be another Transformers movie...Michael has certainly lost the touch, so don't expect too much out of him any more...P.S.

108,RevRonster,"Well, at the very least, it's easier to watch than the 2nd one...",6,2 July 2014,"I'm not the kind of geek who sits there and cries that Michael Bay is spitting all over my childhood by making bad Transformers films (I'm optimistic enough to think he's not that evil). To be honest, I actually really enjoyed the first film (well, all the scenes that lacked people of flesh and blood, anyway) but the 2nd and 3rd film were too much for me. Too much unfunny sophomoric humor, too much girls with fake orange tans (I get it, Bay, you clearly have a type), too much action that was impossible to see, and, finally, too much Shia LaBeouf stuttering like a mental patient. However, ""Transformers: Age of Extinction,"" from the trailer, seemed like it was going to improve on all these faults. For the most part, it didhowever; it still had its fair share of problems that resulting in the usual Transformers-level of disappointment.Right off the bat, the film has a better human cast than all the previous films combined. While I wanted Shia gone since the first one, I never really realized the full scope of how Shia LaBeouf brought the films down. Without him stammering like a moron for two hours, the movie (even with its sloppy story) felt far more subdued and far less insane. Additionally, T.J. Miller and Stanley Tucci are able to bring genuinely funny moments without the usual and embarrassing humor that saturated the other films. Finally, even though we still have to deal with Michael Bay bringing in another orange tanned white girl who has no real character attributes beyond ""potential kidnap victim"" and ""rescue waiting to happen,"" the film brings in a great antagonist in the form of Kelsey Grammar. Too bad that Mark Wahlberg wasn't able to match him (although on the good guy spectrum). While I enjoy Marky Mark, he just looked like he was giving the ""I really don't care"" effort that he gave in ""The Happening."" The hardest part to deal with in this film had to have been the film's length and the story. While the movie starts strong with a story that involves the humans teaming up with Transformers bounty hunter Lockdown in order to bring down their kind, the film suddenly starts to feel like a second script was hastily added on and it results in a running time that went on longer than it really should have. This also showcases and highlights the fact that the Dinobots, while awesome to actually see in action (and then immediately feel bad for because Optimus disrespects Grimlock by riding him like a horse), were clearly just tacked on to the story in order to give a nod and a wink to the fans and utilize them as nothing more than something to get people to the theaters.While ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" has some good parts like the action, a story that starts strong, and finally getting rid of the bad humor and even worse actor that stunk the film up, the movie is still suffering from the usual Transformers disappointment thanks to a story that gets very sloppy and other minor complaints that added up to something as bad as those racist robots from the second onealthough, this film is far less groan-inducing than that one.Greetings, fellow adventurer!

Lots of things blowing up, lots of robot fights, young girl in push up bra, dumb disposable friend, silly dialog, annoying little robots and villains that are more interesting than the good guys. No I wasn't surprised at anything I saw on scene during this movie.But what I was surprised about was the level of violence to humans and the foul language as this is a movie that parents are going to take their children to (I took my 10 year old grandson). It should have been given an ""R"" rating. I was really disappointed at Michael Bay for ruining a great franchise this this sort of stuff.Lastly I wish they had taken the auto-bots off world and forgot totally about allying them with humans. The two villains (Kelsey Grammar and Titus Welliver were great; Stanley Tucci was a little annoying and the women were interchangeable and irrelevant).

Sure they looked cooler, but I think you can sell more toys if the kids like their personas.And I always feel like they should not even bother putting the Deceticons in the film, it's like Bay truly hates them and tends to disrespect them whenever he makes these films. Megatron is suppose to be the main antagonist as the Deceticon leader but you would never know this from this or any other movie.I did like Markie Mark better as the human protagonist than I liked Shia Lebeuf. Mr. Wahlberg seemed like a much better fit for Bay's blend of action comedy. Although his interaction with the Transformers seemed fake in comparison to the relationship Shia develop with Bee.Kelsy Grammar was also a well played human antagonist. Then again, his only real competition was Patrick Dempsey who played the role in the last film. I always had mixed feelings about the use of humans over Transformers in the franchise, and this ensemble cast was the weakest of all the movies. Which would have been fine if the Transformers, now taking more of a center stage were not just as weak. No matter how good the green screen was it really felt like the humans and the Transformers were in different rooms when they interacted.Michael Bay had some good camera shots and there was some good visual effects (especially with the fight scenes), but it's not that impressive. So far, Transformers 3 was the best one and this is trailing behind number 2.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
112,PyroSikTh,"Good Ideas, Bad Execution",5,9 July 2014,"I know this seems a bit weird for a Michael Bay movie about giant, alien robots, but I'm going to talk about the plot first. It's very interesting. As the Transformers movies have gone on, the mythos has expanded a little bit more every time. Revenge of the Fallen touched upon the ancestry of Primes and delved into the Transformer's history a bit. It even showed us Cybertron. Dark of the Moon similarly gave us a Prime higher in authority than Optimus, and showed how travelling over large distances was possible for them. Age of Extinction gave us our first glimpse (and it is a glimpse, literally a finger) of the alien creators of the Transformers. The film opens with them coming to pre-historic Earth, when dinosaurs roamed. There's also the introduction of a third, neutral faction of bounty hunters - neither Autobot nor Decepticon. Add to all that an espionage plot where the CIA are covertly knocking out Autobots and claiming they were Decepticons, and you've actually got a pretty interesting turn of events.Unfortunately the whole government conspiracy takes up most the movie. I mean, it's not a bad plot point, and I certainly wouldn't have cut it out entirely, but there were just so many other, more interesting bits that needed fleshing out. The Dinobots for example. They should've been a big focus of the movie, but they're literally introduced at the end during the final climax, and barely explained at all bar a very short opening sequence on pre-historic Earth. Who are they? What side are they on? Where have they been this entire time? There was a scene early on detailing the discovery of one of them in the antarctic, but how did they get out from there? And where were they between then and the end of the movie? It's a massive gaping hole.Talking of holes, Age of Extinction is full of them. Characters just say random things at random times that make no sense according to their context. In one instance, you can hear Whalberg and Reynor's voices, but their lips aren't even moving. This also extends to entire scenes, making you feel like something reasonably important has been cut out. There's just no fluidity. An example of this would be when they're trying to escape the black ops agents the first time around in fields and farms, and then suddenly they're in a small town, and then suddenly an abandoned industrial estate.So how do the new characters weigh up? I'm not a Shia LaBeouf hater, but his character had gotten old. He had gone through high school, college, and had a job, there wasn't really anywhere else to go with him without going melodramatic with a wife and kids. Cade Yeager (terrible name by the way) is a much more interesting concept for a character. He's a single father dragging his teenage daughter through the poverty line. Of course his daughter is still an orange dressed in hot pants and mini skirts. At least she isn't Rosie Huntington-Whitely! If I had one complaint, and it is a big one, it's how none of this dysfunctional family were likable. Cade is an overprotective father who won't let his daughter date for some stupid reason (and won't shut up about it), Tessa is whiny, self-centered and belongs in 90210, her boyfriend, Shane, is a serious rally driver (conveniently, for some plausible driving tricks), but is completely disrespectful to Cade, Cade's business partner, Lucas, is an unreliable, selfish bum, Joyce is egotistical and pernickety, Darcy is practically non-existent. Just like the plot, the concepts are all there and great, but the execution is awful. I was genuinely hoping they would all die by the end of the movie.Lastly, visuals! Plot and characters is not why you see a Michael Bay Transformers movie. You see a Michael Bay Transformers movie for giant robots fighting giant robots and massive explosions. The live-action destruction doesn't always match the CGI. As an example, a Transformer gets thrown amongst some cars, and the whole row of cars flips, even the ones the Transformer is nowhere near. This happens all the time too; cars just spontaneously decide to do flips. The good thing about Age of Extinction's visuals is that it's quite picturesque at times. Okay, it can get cheesy with this, but a good shot is a good shot, cheesy or not. For example Whalberg is thinking deeply, staring off into nothing while stood on his porch in front of a red sunset. It's horrifically cliché, but so pretty to look at. Age of Extinction is nowhere near the best of the franchise, and it's not a particularly revolutionary franchise as it is. It's probably on about the same level as Revenge of the Fallen, take that as you will. There's lots of pretty pictures and interesting concepts, but it runs on for far too long and the pacing is completely off. Bay tried to squeeze in a lot of plot as well as never-ending action sequences, and it almost put me to sleep, literally. There was a moment I was struggling to keep my eyes open. I can't bring myself to say it's awful though. There were a lot of awesome moments, and it did bring some interesting things to the table; Transformers 5 could be a very interesting movie indeed. In all, I give Age of Extinction an average 5/10.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
113,CinematicInceptions,Sloppy and lacks the all important element of entertainment.,4,5 September 2015,"Honestly, I was expecting much better. I didn't really think Transformers could plausibly get worse than Revenge of the Fallen, but I was wrong. The previous three weren't masterpieces or anything like that, but they at least felt relatively cohesive and were somewhat entertaining. Age of Extinction was neither of those things, not even featuring any good action set pieces. The plot is, as expected, action driven. There's some kind of motivation behind the various fight scenes and it's usually well explained why the conflict is occurring. There are basically three story lines: Lockdown (a foreign transformer) attempting to capture the remaining autobots with the help of Harold Attinger, Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) joining up with the autobots to keep his daughter Tessa safe from the various antagonists and her boyfriend Shane, and Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci) running his company, KSI, that produces man-made transformers. Eventually, the main plot motivator is a seed that has the capability to terraform matter into the same metal that transformers are made of. That should sound like pretty familiar territory to those who have seen the other three. The couple of dialogue scenes concerning the seed between Joshua Joyce and Harold Attinger seemed very unmotivated; it was clear they were mad at each other, but they may as well have been speaking another language because none of their dialogue told you why. Megatron comes back in the form of Galvatron, a KSI robot that basically gets possessed by Megatron's mind and turns all the KSI robots into decepticons. This line of action really wasn't necessary, and just made things unnecessarily confusing and added to the overall sloppiness of the movie.Optimus Prime is still head of what few autobots are left, but I liked him much less in this than in the other three. Him verbally breaking his rule of never killing humans, while called for by the circumstances, made it seem like the screenwriters are now just looking for excuses for him to break every part of his code. It worked out okay for him to go against his code a little in Dark of the Moon because it came at the end of the movie and what we then assumed to be the end of the whole series. The same basic thing happens with Cade Yeager accepting Tessa and Shane's relationship. Even though you can understand why Cade wants to shield Tessa, he doesn't have a very good argument since she was born while he was still in high school. It makes sense, but you don't really like Cade as much because of it. Bumblebee returns to be the main vehicle for the humans involved and still talks through the radio, along with Brains, the little old ex-decepticon from 2 and 3. The new autobots are modeled off of three stereotypes: a lower-class British gangster (Crosshairs), a samurai (Drift), and a fat 'murica cowboy soldier (Hound). I guess that was supposed to give them personality, but there are certainly better ways to go about it.Obviously the visual effects are going to look nice with the Dinobots and Lockdown's ship and the big explosions. The script was one of the worst I think I've ever encountered. All the new autobots dialogue was dictated by their respective stereotypes, and everyone had that same style of comic relief that we've become used to in the past three films. I wasn't huge on the humorous parts in the first three, but I wasn't annoyed by them either. Here, there wasn't anything that struck me as funny, and there was so much of it that it was just a constant annoyance. Despite the script, the acting actually was decent. You can tell Mark Wahlberg had fun in his role, and I'm sure John Goodman enjoyed voicing Hound. Stanley Tucci played his part well also. Most of the shots were well called, but there were still a couple that generated that sense of sloppiness.I don't want to say that you shouldn't watch it since there are certainly people who would find it entertaining, but don't set high expectations. The big budget didn't go to waste as such, but it is very disappointing that something that spends and grosses such massive amounts of money comes out poorly. You'll want to set aside a couple nights to watch it due to the 165 minute run time. It's probably better to watch on a larger, hd screen since it's all huge action set pieces. I don't want to influence your box office decisions too much, but my last word on the matter is this: I don't plan on seeing any future Transformers films if they're going to be like this and be a little bit of an insult to cinema in general. Overall Rating: 6.1/10.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
114,ClaytonDavis,How dare you Michael Bay? How dare you?,3,25 June 2014,"I uttered that exact question to a passing critic upon walking out of the latest screening of Michael Bay's Transformers: Age of Extinction. He shook his head in dismay. The director, who has made his mark on films like Pearl Harbor and The Island, has hit a new low with his latest installment in the Hasbro franchise. Not only does the film inhabit some of the worst dialogue spoken in years, which led many audiences to laugh outrageously loud, but it has the audacity to clock in at over two and a half hours. Talk about indulging in your own perverted and simplistic style that offers no value to an already crumbling franchise. If you thought Megan Fox spread out against a car was out of line, wait until you see newcomer Nicole Peltz rock booty shorts and deliver an acting range reminiscent of a post-American Pie Tara Reid.Michael Bay managed to tone down and clear up his visual spectacles that haven't worked consistently in the other Transformer films. Much better choreography, layered with clarity, makes the action sequences much more fun to enjoy. The sound design is still some of the best seen in film this year. The entire team, which includes Oscar's most overdue craftsman Greg P. Russell, is superb. You can't find a more dedicated and audibly creative team working in the business. Finally, in a film that is the first to be shot in full IMAX Digital 3D cameras, wearing those glasses hasn't felt that cool in quite some time. It's worth the extra cash.Now, let's get on with the fundamental issues.Mark Wahlberg is a fine actor. Also, he's someone that I can only assume is very smart and capable of many different things outside of his normal acting deliveries however, he needs to learn his limitations as an actor and learn them fast. In a Michael Bay film, you expect cheesy dialogue delivery, and even worse cheap moments at laughter or tears. In no normal universe does the general public accept Wahlberg as an intellectual. He plays Cade Yeager, a farmhand who also happens to be an inventor. An inventor? When's the last time you looked at Marky Mark and said, ""I bet Mark could create a really cool robot if he wanted to."" This is also one of the things he exhibited in M. Night Shymalan's The Happening a few years back and he's doing it again. Stick to your tough guy roles and producing outstanding films like Lone Survivor and The Fighter. Stay away from being the ""smart guy"" in a movie. Also, utilizing the same joke like ""lucky charms"" barely worked the first time. Get ready to hear that one half a dozen times throughout. Stanley Tucci is one of my favorite character actors working in the business. Loved him in films like Julie & Julia, The Devil Wears Prada, and even manages to be the best part of a bad thing like in The Lovely Bones. As Joshua Joyce, Tucci takes over the ""hole"" left by John Turturro from the previous films. Short of getting peed on by a giant robot, Tucci's character is completely unbelievable and completely obnoxious. Just in case you didn't know, the sub name of this film is ""Age of Extinction."" The trailers have displayed ""bad ass dinobots,"" roaring and gearing up to kick some Decepticon butt. Just over the two-hour mark I say to myself, ""Self"", because that's what I call myself, ""Selfthis movie is suppose to have Dinobots in it, isn't it?"" And low and behold, enter the wackest and most disappointing Dinobots imaginable. Their infusion into the story is lazy, they barely rally up any excitement, and they're barely on-screen in a 165 minute robot epic. What the hell? The nine-year-old boy inside me calls bullshit.I like you Kelsey Grammar but you are a non-threatening bad-ish guy and I never want to see you in something like this again. Newcomer Jack Reynor, let me give you some life advice. I didn't realize until the movie was over that you played the lead role in the independent film What Richard Did from last year. I liked you quite a bit in that film. As the token hot-guy with an Irish accent, who sort of looks like he's in the Hemsworth family, I need you to seek out other action vehicles for yourself to become a household name. And if they're trying to get you into the house talk by having Mark Wahlberg call you ""lucky charms"" a dozen times, and never get a chuckle from the audience, talk to your agent. I give you permission to enter the Marvel or even TV superhero universe. But hey, you're going to be in MacBeth by Justin Kurzel so maybe you already got this advice.And now the bottom of the barrel: writer Ehren Kruger, who penned a film that is nearly three hours and has the nerve to leave us on a semi- cliffhanger, when I just invested my time to something when I could have been buying Q-Tips or playing Ker Plunk, is a slap in the face. And you're the guy who wrote Arlington Road and The Ring, two films with cliffhangers that work and are EARNED. You did not earn a single moment, whether it was laughing at the serious moments or not laughing at the funny moments. Please do better. And not just for me, think about humanity in general. This is science fiction with giant fighting robots, and it was completely unrealistic in more moments than not. Oh, and your total Man of Steel rip off was completely noticed and I'd appreciate it if you did things a little more discreet.Read More @ The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Even at their dumbest and most stupid moments, these films have always blown me away, leaving me satisfied and excited in a way that all the best summer blockbusters can. I would have been happy if they left it where it was, with the Chicago battle in Dark of the Moon serving as the final climax to the series. With the closing of the first three films, filmmakers decided to kick off a new trilogy with a new cast and new story arc.It takes a while for the film to build its momentum. Once it does, you can certainly expect the same kind of big-scale spectacle that the last films provided: an onslaught of bullets and rockets, huge explosions, cars flying in all directions, robots bashing each other to scrap, and entire cities being ripped apart. When the action picks up, it becomes a stream of setpieces, one after another, that takes the characters across the US, onboard alien spaceships, and ultimately to China for the final battle. In the midst of it all, a plethora of new Transformer characters pop up, including an all-too-brief and understated appearance by the Dinobots and Grimlock.As cool as it all is, I can't escape the feeling that something is missing. The film drags at spots, especially in the opening act. A lot of the manic, goofy comedy is gone, and what little remains isn't really all that great. The overall experience is not nearly as enthralling as the film's predecessors; it feels like business as usual, offering little new to the table and offering little that I'd say actually blew me away or made a lasting impression. Parts of it are a bit daft...moreso than usual.The story has its moments. Ditching the saga of Sam Witwicky, the film focuses on a Texan dude, his daughter, and her boyfriend, setting up the exact same dynamic that went into the characters of Armageddon. What matters the most is that they all go on the run, hunted by the government while becoming caught up in a new war between Autobots and a mysterious faction of aliens. The Autobot characters had a weird penchant for infighting, and seemed to harbor a lot more angst than before, which made them a lot less endearing. The plot is pretty much just one thing after another, before reaching a lengthy all-out battle at the end. As long as the film is, it feels like a two or three different Transformers films have been shoved into one, and I think parts of it could have been trimmed easily. For the most part, the plot is rather thinly stitched together, serving as little more than an excuse to blow more stuff up.The film boasts some really great imagery in some scenes, some horrid camera-shake in a few action scenes, and the rest of it looks a bit plain. Editing seemed pretty cheap, with choppy action scenes and one too many shortcuts. Acting is okay: Mark Wahlberg is pretty much the same kind of dude he always plays, Nicola Peltz is average, Stanley Tucci is fun to watch, and Kelsey Grammar is surprisingly effective in his role. Writing is kinda bad. This production spares no expense on the locales, props, and costumes. Special effects look great in some scenes and weak in others. Music has some interesting moments.The fourth Transformers film is pretty much more of the same - loud, bloated, excessive - which is fun at times, but I find it's not as consistently energetic or satisfying as its predecessors. I don't think this film is quite as bad as critics make it out to be, but if you hated these films before, you'll certainly hate this installment. If you're a fan, you'll might enjoy this all the same.3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Marginal | Film: Average)",Transformers - Age of Extinction
117,ArchonCinemaReviews,Dead Horse? I'm here to beat you now!,4,22 December 2014,"Once again Michael Bay unnecessarily makes an additional film for the Transformers franchise, and Age of Extinction is slightly better than the rest.After the much maligned and incredibly lazy previous Transformers film, it was almost impossible for Transformers: Age of Extinction to be worse than its predecessor.As with any franchise that is in its fourth installment, reinvention and recasting reinvigorate the story and premise of the Transformers. Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf), Mikaela Banes (Megan Fox), Captain William Lennox (Josh Duhamel), Agent Simmons (Tyrese Gibson) and even Robert Epps (John Turturro) are nowhere to be found in Age of Extinction. Instead there is a new family that becomes entangled in the Autobot siege.Mark Wahlberg plays the tech savvy Cade Yeager who is a single father to 17-year old Tessa, Nicola Peltz. After the world-changing battle that leveled most of Chicago, America's relationship and partnership with the Autobots is significantly changed. Government agencies struggle to find the remaining aliens in hiding in an attempt to increase security. The Yeagers become caught in the middle of the crossfire when they themselves find and aid the damaged Optimus Prime.There is nothing new at all with Michael Bay's fourth Transformers film so it's almost incomprehensible that the movie stretches over two and a half hours. Viewers have seen three movies worth of action sequences using CGI-ed robotic aliens and there is absolutely nothing new in this film. The only exception is we get to see a transformer dinosaur. In my opinion Bay thought having an Autobot dinosaur fight scene would be pretty rad and catered the rest of the story to allow for it.Maybe as an act of redemption, the production company once again brings to life Ehren Kruger's screenplay, the same writer responsible for all previous sequels to the Transformer's original. It is overcomplicated and attempts to cram far too much sub-plot lines in order to revitalize interest in the waning franchise.Age of Extinction caters to the audiences that just want to get lost in a mindless summer blockbuster. The character dynamic between father and daughter is cheaply overplayed, exacerbated by mediocre acting from Wahlberg.

120,maxglen,Elements to be enjoyed but a bit lengthy,6,20 August 2020,"I'll start by saying this isn't the worst of the Bay Transformers movies and I can't quite fathom how this has a lower user rating than Revenge of the Fallen. Let me explain how I feel about the inner workings of Age of Extinction and where I feel it falls in quality in comparison to the others. Let's talk dialogue... it's not good. It's pretty bad in fact. At best it's okay and at worst it's basically laughable. ""My face is my warrant"" stands out. The characters (humans at least) are also not up to par with the LaBeouf trilogy with the exception of Stanley Tucci who is as magnificent as ever and definitely the stand out. Story wise there's basically nothing here, that being said I didn't exactly expect Citizen Kane. I must say I do like the 'Remember Chicago' backdrop and Autobots in exile subplot as it is nice to know despite the lack of Sam Witwicky we still inhabit his world and the practically apocalyptic events of Dark of the Moon weren't forgotten whilst AoE was being conceived. The action is a little less consistent than that of the first 3 but it still has a few of those jaw dropping set pieces, namely the ones with the Dinobots who are near perfect and my only complaint is that they showed up so late to the mix. The sequences with Galvatron are fast, flashy and exciting, although I'm not particularly a fan of his design, especially after the brilliant redesigns in the first few and the original Galvatron from Transformers: The Movie. Lockdown is also a pretty fine addition to the franchise, his unaligned loyalties to either Autobots or Decepticons makes him far more interesting than he has any right to be. In summary... Age of Extinction is a fine popcorn flick that falters where it's script is concerned but succeeds in being a visually engaging, mindless action romp. I'd place it above Revenge of the Fallen but no where near as good as Dark of the Moon or Transformers (2007). A strong 6 to a light 7",Transformers - Age of Extinction
121,p-jonsson,"Great FX, abysmal movie",4,28 November 2014,"I have watched all the other Transformers movies and I have liked them. I have liked them a lot. Yes the stories have been comic book quality but it has been fun watching them nonetheless. This onenot so much. I was actually rather disappointed at the end despite having tuned down my expectations on pretty much everything except the special effects.The special effects are good. It has to be said. They are really great. The transformations are cool as ever and the new transformations by the human made transformers adds a nice FX twist. The fighting is gorgeous. The Dinobots were really cool.However, 165 minutes where the only enjoyment is one FX after another and where the scenes without FX are simply a drag is just not what I call a good movie. It is at best a special effects catalogue of what can be done. A showcase for other movie makers telling them: ""Look how good my team is at making FX"".The story of this movie is pretty thin. That the Autobots, that saved the planet, should be hunted down again is just an unintelligent and dumb cliché. It could have been made into something usable though if it was not implemented with utter incompetence. I mean, come on, there is not a likable person in the entire bloody movie. Well, with the possible exception of a few side characters. The hero is an ass, his ""friend"" that betrays them is a dumb ass, his daughter is just a dumb poor actor, the chief of staff is laughable. The list goes on. To make matters worse the bad guys that are supposed not to be likable are just bland, dumb arses. No character and mediocre acting at best.Sometimes the scenes are disconnected with strange jumps in the middle of the action as well. This must be the worst implementation of an already poor story that I have watched it a long while. The only thing that lifts this movie above a zero star rating are the great special effects. For once I side with the so called ""critics"" that trash this movie.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

If you put your brains in neutral (or in reverse), this movie is bearable and probably better than some of the previous ones. But that doesn't say much...Best decision: Getting rid of Shia LaBeouf. Worst decision: Keeping the new bimbo.I still can't decide whether this one is the smartest or dumbest line of dialog in the movie: ""The movies nowadays, that's the trouble. Sequels and remakes, bunch of crap."" (an actual line from the movie) So, the writers/makers are obviously aware they are making crap, but I wonder whether it's a ""self-aware"" thing to make the audience laugh or whether it was intended to joke on the expense of the dumbest audience that don't understand they are paying to watch manufactured crap. In other words, it's unclear whether the makers are laughing WITH the audience or AT them.Apple should probably use this method too, for advertising their next iPhone: ""The new iPhone is crap, but we know you're going to buy it anyway.""",Transformers - Age of Extinction

124,James_De_Bello,3/10,3,25 September 2014,"3/10 An excruciating experience of such low level it continuously invited me to say f**k you to the screen and leave the theater. Let me get one thing clear before this: I am NOT a Micheal Bay basher. I really like ""The Rock"" and ""Armaggedon"" was a film I watched really often as a child and now has become a great guilty pleasure of mine. On the other had I really don't like the Bad Boys film and have never loved any of the Transformers one. Sure I liked the first one, but the second and third did nothing for me, yet I was never a total hater of them I still managed to find some good things out that managed to somehow keep me watching them until the end (my votes for them are 4.5 to 5). I will not hate on a Bay movie just because it's a Bay movie. Furthermore I actually think Michael Bay has some great pluses on his side: for one he can shoot the living hell out of anything and no matter what his CGI shots will 99% of the times be fully credible. Yet this cannot save what Transformes 4 is. Whilst in its two predecessors we could perceive a sprinkle of a storyline that managed in some way to bring us from point A to point B here it seems the filmmakers have totally forgotten what storytelling is: if there had to be given a grade to this movie only on the basis of its storytelling it would be zero. There is simply nothing here. No character feels in anyway believable both in his/her dialouge or actions, things are thrown at you on the screen and so many times you have no idea where they came from or what are they doing there. This movie has such a bad and vicious story it drives me mad to think that it actually managed to get on the silver screen in these conditions. The action feels boring 95% of time and for most of it you simply cannot make out clearly what's going on because of an overload of CGI that contributes driving you mad. I don't even know how to start addressing the length problem of this movie because I cannot comprehend how an editor and Bay could have actually thought this sprawling, unbearable length was minimally acceptable. In regards to editing of cuts this thing was so unbelievably fast and repetitive I thought I was cgoing to have an epileptic attack. The screenplay is basically a roller-coaster of shitty mess, so bad at times that you actually feel as if you're watching someone play a video game of the 90s and listening to that dialogue, characters are throwing random annoying one-liners here and there and the more you go on the worse it gets. The movie manages to fail even in the sound department (its predecessors at least were good in this matter): the editing is totally random and alternates moments of mute action to very loud effects in a maniacally horrible way. lets just not get started on the direction which is totally out of control or the ethics of this movie that left me disgusted. All of this adds to an experience of anger and torture that made me frantically move around my seat in the theater and managed to get me up on my feet out of boredom or disbelief multiple times. I was physically shaken both inside the cinema and when I got out: this thing was a disaster. The movie manages to save itself from being defined a useless pile of total garbage thats to the talent of Mark Walberg and some of his fellow cast members. They somehow succeed thanks to their charisma in keeping you awake and with your eyes pointed to the screen. The youngsters too here don't give bad performances and contribute in making this mildly bearable at times. You add this to the visual style of Micheal Bay and all in all however stupid and ridiculous this movie was it still maintained a level of watchability and actually had two actions scenes (that add up to 6-7 minutes of film) that were legitimately great and breathtaking. yet on the other hand they made me more angry because they demonstrated that Bay knows his action and can shoot something spectacular if he actually cared about it all.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
125,scottshak_111,Michael Bay shat his pants and made you sneak! Nay....Stare!,5,27 June 2014,"What a load of crap! So far the worst Transformer's flick. Yes! This beats the Revenge Of The Fallen big time! The worst direction I have seen in a Steven Spielberg produced flick. Screenplay makes you laugh, seems as if a kid wrote it! The editing is pathetic and so is the drama. There are so many unnecessary bits strewn all across the movie, which redefines jaded. The frequent glint from the sun (what was that about? huh!) Fight sequences are okay, nothing memorable though. Dinobots take your adrenaline to a high but rock bottom you after there transformation bit gets over. Few slow-mo bits look rad, but that's that. The rest of the hoopla makes you yawn! And boy horror is prolonged! Stares down your soul for more than 2 and a half hours! Beware! Ye be warned!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
126,Puroo,I never thought I'd say this but... Transformers movies can be bad too!,4,8 August 2021,"Looking at the poster and trailer of this movie I was thinking this might be something really good. I had recently watched the first three movies of this franchise and I really liked the whole concept of Transformers; just seeing them do something on the big screen is enough to get my attention. So when I heard that this is the worst movie of the franchise, the robot dinosaur poster refused to let me believe that. How can a movie with such a good CGI possibly be bad? And when I watched it... I now apologise to all those people I didn't trust. I'm really sorry.The problem with this movie is that it has humans. I know, Transformers are all about Autobots and humans interacting and coming together to beat Decepticons, but the humans in this movie are terrible. I forgave Dark of the Moon since it was Sam Witwicky, the same guy we had previously seen in two prequels. But this time, it's the new guy. I don't even remember his name, so let's just call him Mark Wahlberg. Mark is such a two dimensional character. He loves mechanical engineering and hates anyone approaching his daughter. Yes, that's his entire personality.So when Optimus Prime ends up coming to his lab, they bond together. The premise of this movie is all wrong. The Autobots are now considered criminal in this world because of the destruction that happened in the previous movie. Like, what? Dude, even the army was doing destruction in the previous movie if that's supposed to be a real reason. Also everyone saw the Autobots fight the Decepticons in the epic climax moment. And it's not like there's some communication gap between the Autobots and the humans, since Optimus Prime literally lived with the military. So if there's any problem at all, they can just talk about it.So anyway Optimus helps Mark, his daughter and her boyfriend escape from there, and they team up with Hound and some other Transformers (I don't even remember the names at this point, because they don't give a reason to do so). Together they go to The Lost World where Optimus fights the robot T-Rex for which I watched this movie in the first place. First of all, the T-Rex is like, five times bigger than Optimus Prime. For comparison, just try fighting an elephant with your bare hands (except that elephants are herbivores and won't attack you unprovoked). And after the beating that T-Rex becomes friends with Optimus because it's a Michael Bay movie.So then there's the epic showdown battle between Mark and some bad guys. I was doing my college project on my laptop and this movie was running on my phone's Prime Video, so I used to only look at the movie whenever something interesting would be happening, otherwise I'd just keep doing my work. I don't think I looked at the screen more than 3-4 times throughout the work. This is the reason why I can guarantee you that it's a boring movie. I don't remember most of it.Transformers: Age of Extinction is the movie that taught me that Transformers could be bad too. Earlier I used to see Screen Rant articles which said that after a time the movies went repetitive with the CGI fighting and explosions, so I didn't understand what's bad about it since that's literally what I watch them for. But it turns out the reason why I hate it is the other way round. The big, cool robots have now turned into parodies of themselves and the humans are no longer even close to being interesting. I'd say if you haven't begun watching this franchise, just watch the first three and then jump straight to Bumblebee. That would save a lot of time and inner peace.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
127,shawneofthedead,"A combination of the best and worst elements of this franchise, this manages to have both too little and too much plot - and it's way, way too long.",5,30 June 2014,"Does a movie about noble robots battling evil robots really need a plot? Most of us would think not, but director Michael Bay - still deeply enamoured of his metal-crunching blockbuster franchise - begs to differ. To re-invigorate the series, Bay has crafted an overstuffed, occasionally draggy film that unfolds in three, or four, or five acts (it really is and does feel that long), which miraculously manages to be quite entertaining even as it sorely tests the patience of anyone but the most adoring of Transformers devotees.Backyard inventor Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) takes the place of Shia LeBeouf's Sam Witwicky: a widower who fixes up junk and takes stuff apart for a living. He's utterly devoted to the safety and protection of his teenage daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz), though he might not be that great at taking care of her daily needs. One day, he uncovers a broken- down truck crusted over with rust and dirt and takes it home, only to realise that he's found a Transformer - one of those pesky robotic aliens who destroyed Chicago in films past and are now on the American government's blacklist. Soon, Cade and his family are on the run, drawn into a global conspiracy orchestrated by shady ex-CIA agent Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammar).You'd think that would be plenty of story for a movie about enormous transforming robots, but you'd be wrong. We're first led to believe that Cade is up against a wicked scientific cabal led by Stanley Tucci's money-hungry inventor, Joshua Joyce - his nefarious firm KSI is only boiling apart old Transformers, Autobots (good guys) and Decepticons (bad guys) alike, to figure out how they work. That's pretty nefarious. But then, the narrative shifts, slips and slides into the evil designs of Lockdown, a badass Decepticon determined to hunt down Autobot leader Optimus Prime. And that's all before the entire cast winds up in Hong Kong, and Dinobots - fan favourite alert! - rampage across the cityscape.To Bay's credit, this hugely awkward plotting - which results in a bum-numbing run time of 165 minutes - actually all sort of makes sense in the end, and even yields halfway decent characters. The film's first act, in which we meet the Yeager family, establishes their dynamic very well. Bay chose quite cannily, too, with his cast. Wahlberg handles the action sequences (including a spot of parkour down the side of a Hong Kong tenement building) as well as he does the comedy - he forms a somewhat amusing, occasionally tedious double act with Tessa's boyfriend (Jack Reynor), whom he christens 'Lucky Charms' with less grace than rage in his heart. Tucci, too, is probably one of the few actors alive who could pull off his character's decidedly bumpy plot trajectory, and Grammar gives good menace as Attinger.But the film begins to fall apart as it goes on - the relatively tight, characterful plotting at the start gives way to enormous logical inconsistencies (why are there no surveillance cameras to hinder our heroes in top scientific facilities like KSI and Lockdown's spaceship?!). Over-the-top scenes of metal-crunching mayhem are, of course, the entire point of this franchise, but Bay shoehorns them into the film with such regularity that it begins to feel like overkill after a while. Don't get us wrong, the visual effects are genuinely wonderful: in fact, Galvatron, KSI's shape-shifting prototype of a man-made Transformer, tumbles through the air with arresting grace, and there's probably very little that's cinematically more exciting than watching Optimus Prime ride a gigantic metal T-Rex into battle. But it's a case of too much, too often: by the end, you can't help but feel that the film would have been a lot better if Bay had sliced off at least forty minutes of footage.For a brief moment in time, Bay claimed that he would not return to the Transformers franchise - even he was worn out, perhaps, by the demands of staging so many explosions with so little to show for it. But return he did, with a new cast and story - and the result is, well, a bit of a mixed bag. Root around within Age Of Extinction, and there are some truly promising, well-executed moments. The characters feel fresh and surprisingly real (at least at the start), and it seems as if Bay has once again found just the right formula in balancing man against machine, as he did with the very first film. But this fourth film also bears the worst characteristics of the franchise: the inability to weight story against action, with spectacle ultimately beating restraint into submission. There's no doubt Bay will be back for Round 5, but it's hard to decide on the basis of this film whether that's something audiences should anticipate... or fear.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
128,Figgy66-915-598470,Non stop action,9,6 July 2014,"6 July 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Transformers - Age of Extinction. Oh how I love a good action movie and this did not disappoint. Fans of the Transformer franchise, if you have been eagerly awaiting this new instalment, wait no more. It's gritty, full of action and I mean non stop action and how I love that Red and Blue shiny truck that is Optimus Prime. The whole feel of this film was different to the last three (I watched all three on Friday as a quick catchup before seeing this instalment). Set five years after the last battle which almost completely annihilated Chicago, we see men and alien robots once again engage in an epic conflict. As always men think they are better than the Autobots and that they know what is good for mankind, and aligning themselves with the wrong side is bound to go badly. Mark Wahlberg played Cade Yeager a misunderstood inventor who having reared his daughter on his own is an overprotective Father whose ultimate goal throughout the whole film is save his daughter first, the rest of the world second. Stanley Tucci (who incidentally can do no wrong in my book) plays a billionaire defence contractor working with the bad guys. This film takes us on an exhausting journey which jumps from battle to battle and sees a whole new bunch of Autobots joining with Optimus and Bumble Bee to save us from ourselves and the Decepticon threat. The only thing not in this film's favour was the casting of Mark Wahlberg and Nicola Peltz as father and daughter, it didn't work for me, they looked too close in age. Mark is just not looking old enough to be the father of a 19 year old girl. Great film though!!!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
129,kermitkid,Solid reboot,7,30 March 2020,"This is, yet again, another time when I disagree with Rotten Tomatoes. This movie is AWESOME!!!! Just forget the previous 3 films happened. This is both a sequel and a reboot. Only this time, the movie works. I think Micheal Bay is learning from his mistakes. Although this film is not without flaws of its own, it's not a pop culture travesty like ""Transformers 2 and 3"" were. The plot is original, (well, as original as you can get when the movie is about robots fighting each other and also based on a property that's existed for 30 years), the dialogue is humorous intentionally, and the soundtrack by Imagine Dragons makes this film even better than I expected. However, the film overuses slow-motion shots. I don't mind if it's used once or twice, but not during every fight scene. Contrary to popular belief slow motion does not make everything look cooler, It can, if used sparingly and correctly, but not like how it's used here. I felt like this film focused to much on the human characters. The movie is called ""Transformers,"" not ""Humans."" If some of the unneccesary scenes, such a one of the characters drinking milk on the roof for 5 minutes (I'm not kidding, this is a legitimate scene. Seriously.) and had used that time to show what we came to see, robots beating each other up, the film could have been a bit better.

130,Rendanlovell,Not good at all.,3,4 November 2014,"Transformers: Age Of Extinction is Micheal Bays' latest installment to his not so beloved Transformers franchise. Most people will agree that they are overlong, boring, and only decent because of some cool transformers action. This film is no different. If you have seen any of the films after the 1st movie then you know exactly how this one is going to be. The only difference is a different cast and new looking robots. The story starts off OK but ends up being to bloated and stupid to make sense of. Micheal probably put his least amount of effort into this one. Its boring and so jumbled by the end that you really don't know if you just watched 1 or several movies at the same time. The new cast is almost as bad as the old cast. Shia had a good presence on screen in the first 3 films and Mark has the same feel. Yet, the side cast is flat and ridiculous at times. Not to mention the outrageous 3 hour run time. It seems like it will never end. But if you like going to the movies just to sit and zone out for a while this film is for you. While zoned out you probably also feel Bay stealing the money right out of your pockets. Like always the VFX is top notch. It really does look better then ever. Some of the new Decepticons are absolutely insane and wickedly cool. But cool VFX does in no way save this movie. All in all Transformers 4 is an overlong, noisy, poor plotted movie. The only reason to see this is for the VFX and even then it may not be worth it.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

132,rollernerd,More than meets the eye,6,12 June 2021,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's movie review is Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014), the fourth entry to the series with new actors, new transformers, new adversaries and a darker tone in comparison to the other films. Cade Yeager played by Mark Wahlberg was actually not too bad of a replacement as the primary protagonist in this new entry. I was content with no Shia and the gang and was interesting to see a new primary character who has issues of his own while trying to be a famous inventor type genius like Einstein. So pretty much after the battle between the Autobots and Decepticons that smashed Chicago, the Americans are no longer working with the Autobots and deem them as a national threat. The CIA have established a black ops style project where a mercenary team hunt and kill Autobots with the help of a new alien species led by a bounty hunter character named Lockdown. This is where Cade comes in a Mr Fix It who buys an old truck and upon examining it guess what?? Yep, you know it - it's the one and only Optimus Prime, who was injured in his escape from the humans and Lockdown. As mentioned, this movie takes on a more serious tone, with plenty of deaths and risks including OG Autobot Ratchet - the medical officer. This was a bummer to me - like out of all the good guys, why this one??The mercenary team led by James Savoy played chillingly by Titus Welliver does a great job as a stone-cold no-nonsense guy. Stanley Tucci does an okay job as this corporate fella who is trying to project Apple big dude Steve Jobs, however Tucci's yelling and screaming was really annoying and why on earth would a character whose soul purpose at the beginning of the film wants the Transformers metal, so he can introduce a new product called, wait for it, Transformium, to build his own army of robots to bring world peace, changes his mind so quickly towards the end? Just because of getting manipulated by Megatron/Galvatron?? And his infatuation with two of the secondary leading women actors - whats happening??Another annoying character who was below subpar was TJ Miller who thankfully was removed early on the film.The Dinobots...the actual one part I was looking forward to - mannnn Michael Bay you legit need to leave the series. The bloke takes a crack at introducing these awesome Dinobots, which by the way look amazing but the character stories of these amazing figures, character that brings back child hood memories who all had amazing stories to be told - all were shattered. There are no backstories and no drama around these legendary characters who smashed it in the cartoon days. Instead, they just get released by Optimus and the filmmakers have us believe that these newbies are going to save the day for the Autobots and for the humans. So disappointing! The only cool part is when Optimus Prime literally rides a team of Dinobots into battle, whipping his giant arm sword against the backside of a metal T-Rex to make it go faster.Now with the Dinobots getting ""awakened"" in the final act, it is interesting to note that this takes place in China for no apparent reason, like we see the Great Wall of China and why? Hmmm I reckon its to appeal to a certain demographic and of course that's where the money is.Again, the core character that shines in this film and these series is Optimus Prime voiced by the legendary Peter Cullen whose voice as this iconic character Optimus delivering the awesome speech then goes charging ahead on a fire-breathing Grimlock's back, sword-waving as he roars a battle cry just gives you chills!! Also, cudos to John Goodman who lent his voice to Hound, the overweight weapons specialist who also provided the comedic relief.The primary villain in this film is Lockdown who is absolutely the most intriguing new aspect of this franchise as he has a no-nonsense attitude along with a ruthless agenda towards the Autobots which can be demonstrated with his brutal encounter with Ratchet earlier in the flick. The words he gives to Ratchet, is in contrast with Revenge of the Fallen, which is funny since both species were on the run and both were given last final words before boom.The story and introductions to key characters were a let down however the film is still fun and entertaining in particular by the great Peter Cullen. Overall, an interesting new take on the series where humans and robots are no longer working together and literally have no respect for each other until it is fixed by wannabe Mr Fix It himself, however the film was still disappointing 5.8/10.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
133,patches89,WE NEED A NEW ARMY!!,6,21 July 2021,"Gone is the era of Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox and even the usual support guys and in comes Mark Wahlberg's Cade Yaeger who considers himself an inventer but is actually just a horder of junk when he comes across Optimus Prime all battered from his encounters with a selection of humans who want to rid the earth of Transformers and working with Lockdown who has a bounty on OP head. The autobots working with Cade and his daughter have to fight off Lockdown and prototype Galvatron who is a resurrected Megatron and stop the seed from being unleashed on earth. Its a fun film visually with good characters that needed better exploring but the plot is all over the place, nothing that was previously explored or explained made any sense and clearly looks like Michael Bay should have passed the reigns over to someone more competent. SFX still wonderful.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
134,jaemiewaters,The best Transformers movie so far,10,5 July 2014,This has been the best Transformers movie so far. If you like a good movie then Transformers Age of Extinction is the movie for you to watch than. If you are going to watch this movie watch it in IMAX 3D. Your kids will love the 3D in this 3 hour movie. I highly recommend this movie for all of the Transformer fans out there. It has been one of the best movies i have seen all year so far. I hope you like this movie as much as i did. I just want to say there is a lot of intense scenes in this movie and it may be a little scary for the little ones out there. It was one of the coolest things ever. Mark did a great job on this movie he is a great actor. The only thing that i hated about this movie is when it was over. This made 100 million dollars on its first weekend and it will do it again motet likely,Transformers - Age of Extinction
135,EvanKevelson,Thought it was a basic evil CIA story,6,19 April 2021,"I thought this was entertaining it's the Transformers. It was good humored. Felt Frazier plaid his role like an Oscar film and he didn't really fit in.The effects were phenomenal the Narcissism thinking he made something new from Megatrons head, was a bit moronic.... Playing with newly discovered Transformium without understanding it was also a bit ridiculous but I felt the movie was a reboot mockery.Even the beginning Optimus shows himself why are they going after Whalberg and his family?Like his one word is going to ruin their business deal.Lots of action but thankfully paced well and broken up. I also read a review mentioning fighting a dynobot, he simply tamed it.Was a little hole in terms of what happened to the seed. They ignore it in the the fifth installment and why Megatron simply observed when he had opportunity to kill the CEO and attain the seed... as I say it's Transformers lol.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
136,jb_campo,Not good - miscast Wahlberg,4,24 June 2015,"This movie is not good. What made it bad most of all was casting Mark Wahlberg as a nerdy inventor. Are you kidding me? that's almost as bad as Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher. a 5.8 foot guy cannot be Reacher who is 6-5, 250lbs, and Wahlberg rough and tumbler cannot be a nerd. It's a non-starter, and the movie unravels from there.He and his daughter have zero chemistry. It looks like they just met! And the rules he sets for her, at that age? Are you kidding me?I did like Stanley Tucci in a different role as the evil or is he inventor. And kudos to kelsey Grammar and titus wilever as the two heartless bad guys - they were great.The acting on the bad guys side was great. The CGI robots were actually better this time, not so dark. Usually you can't tell who is fighting who because the filming is too dark. they fixed that. But still, the story - eh, nothing special. Bad guys come - they attack, oh, will Transformers save us? Of course they will! that's not a spoiler btw, they do it in every movie!!!I'd pass on Age of Extinction unless you really have nothing better to do, or you are a fan of Stanley Tucci.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

138,fcabanski,What!!!???,1,26 December 2016,"It's difficult to describe how bad this movie is.Of the main characters, Marky Mark is by far the best actor. Get it? Kelsey Grammar is a fine actor, but he doesn't have a lot to do in the movie.Transformers is what you get when you combine empty CGI with a lot of models trying to act.Mark is a buffed up inventor who spends all his time inventing, eating junk food, not sleeping, but somehow looking like a body builder.The daughter is a model who poses her scenes, and she has a model looking boy friend who poses his scenes.The most dramatic scene in the movie is Marky's character arguing with his daughter's boy toy friend while they're being chased by maniacs who want to kill them. It's nonsense.There are countless scenes of sparky explosions that don't touch anyone. But when they do, the person turns to metal, or ash, or something. Who knows.Awful in every way.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
139,rehmankhilji,Not up to the expectations,5,23 September 2014,"Well lets say this part was not up to the expectations. Much confusing in the start, like what happened to the old Human Friends of these Alien Robots. What happened to them? nothing was shown no connection was made with the previous ones. One scene Optimus Prime was shown badly damaged and all of sudden he is ready and fighting, no to forget repair himself by copying another vehicle. Secondly the movie is too long... so long that you just want it to end and just end badly. Quiet predictable from the start. In short just watch it for the sake of it and if you are fan of the series. If you haven't watched the previous episodes its better to watch them instead of this one. The team could have done better and much better with the story line.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
140,mardalsfossen01,Had at least signs of a great movie,6,13 February 2019,"'Age Of Extinction' starts alright, Shia LaBeouf got annoying and eye-candy Megan Fox got cut in the 3rd movie already. Mark Wahlberg fits well and was a good replacement. T.J. Miller also was a nice addition to the cast, but I'm surprised he didn't play a bigger role in the end.
I liked that they tried to freshen up the crew of the Autobots and 1 of them worked pretty well while the others are quite forgettable.
The addition of the villain and his plan is alright, but they could've given him more rememberable gadgets and looks when he is by foot.
The beginning and the ending of the movie are decent, everything in-between is a lot of mediocrity.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
141,martinrobertson300482,They really are pushing their luck this time,4,25 July 2014,"Yes, here we have it, another dud from director Michael Bay and his army of transforming robots. Only this time it seems, not even the ""fans"" are happy with the Auto-bots/Decepticons over the top antics. Me myself, I really only even seen this because everyone was saying how bad it was, and I curiously wanted to join in with slating it.In the past, I've probably been more generous than most with these ""transformers"" movies. Although i've never completely liked them, I took them for what they were. Big dumb, Michael Bay action movies. But did we really need a number 4 anyway? Its not like there's an on-going story to follow. Just Bay and his team wanting to suck more money out of teenagers who think these movies are great. Though they really are pushing their luck this time.Yes, the special effects are still amazing, and the dinobots at least bring something new to the table (Mark Wahlberg and his hot daughter from ""Bates Motel"" on the other hand, do not) but all of the flicks other mistakes, are mistakes that shouldn't be here after the previous movies. There's no story, its too long, has to much random stuff going on in places, and is so over the top in others, that its way funnier when its trying to be serious, than it is when its trying to be funny with its take-them-or-leave-them jokes. No More please. Thought the end suggests we're not done with this rubbish yet.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
142,ghost_dog86,I walked out,2,2 July 2014,"From a technical/visual standpoint, it's hard to claim that director Michael Bay doesn't know what he's doing. And to say Bay doesn't know his audience would also be a misnomer. When every sequence contains either a teenage girl in short shorts or an explosion, I would say he knows exactly what his demo (the average American male) wants and/or will, at the end of the day, pay to see. That said, even 100 million dollar visuals in the wrong hands, can manifest into something mind-numbingly repetitive, senseless and desensitizing. So much so, that I literally walked out of the movie three-quarters of the way through. And the rule I tend to adhere to is: If I walk out on a movie, even if it wasn't savagely insulting to my intelligence or exploitative or a Happy Madison production, I feel that giving a one star rating to said movie is completely justified.Synopsis: If anyone cares, ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" follows a mechanic/wannabe engineer (played by Mark Walberg) and his family, as they attempt to help save Optimus Prime and friends (one of them being a pretty racially insensitive stereotype in the guise of a Japanese Transformer) from extermination at the hands of the US government.The premise isn't awful. It's the cringe inducing dialogue, lack of plot focus and annoying characters (basically the overall script) which kills it. Allow me to rephrase that. All of these aspects horribly cripple the premise, but it's Bay's relentless pot and pan clanking assault on the senses style of direction that finishes off the job. And when Mark Wahlberg begins to act, things just go from bad to worse. It's not like Wahlberg is a bad actor, but Bay seems to accentuate every one of his acting flaws, until Mark's character is reduced to a whiny bag of meat and his performance into one that will have audiences begging for the return of Shia LaBeouf.Side Note: I don't want to hear any Age of Extinction apologists who dismiss what I have to say based on some supposition that it was the subject matter (the Transformers themselves) which I had a problem with, and therefore must have gone into this installment fingers crossed for failure. As I was actually one of the few critics who enjoyed the previous Transformers film, I can assure you that your assumption would be wrong. But if you're defending this movie, I can probably make an assumption that you're wrong about a lot of things in life.Final Thought: I want to make it clear why I walked out of this movie. After about 2 hours of politely watching and re-watching the same slow motion sequence of Mark Wahlberg crashing through a plate glass window as things explode around him, I knew I'd seen all Michael Bay and ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" had to offer. And yeah, I got bored. So again, while visually speaking this film wasn't awful, sometimes a boring movie is far worse than a bad one.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

144,ivanmessimilos,Transformers: Age of Extinction - damn u Bay!,2,17 July 2014,"First, a little introduction. I do not know whether you watched the previous three films, but I am. I admit, I am a fan of Transformers, Optimus Prime you love, I loved cartoons when I was a kid, I had the toys, in fact I love the whole universe where you have good (Autobots) and bad (Decepticons) guys who fight each other, but also within the group have developed special characters that are not immersed in the crowd. So, I looked trilogy, I think that they (mostly) good movies, I like the concept, not even action scenes bad :-), though by no means like the main (human) characters. Come on, I overlapped, but a small introduction I wanted to do. Right now the head: this movie sucks with a capital S! I can imagine how it is for others to look at if this is disgusting to me bad! So almost 3 hours watching how Bay uses multiple budget of our beautiful country (Croatia), but he does not care, invested already returned and we will enjoy the fifth installment. Hooray!? No!. No story, bad acting, dumb dialogue, the jokes are on the level of a seven-year child who goes to a special school. Bay is really no director, just knows how to make a movie with 80% of CGI effects and the rest is totally irrelevant. I give the film a respectable 2/10. Because Optimus can not be given a lower rating.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
145,Bruce722,Michael Bay once again misunderstand his viewers.,6,29 June 2014,"Michael Bay just doesn't seem to understand the fans, does he? After the first two incredible films, he has completely dropped the ball on these last two. While I enjoyed this movie a bit more than Dark of the Moon, it was still a mediocre film. The acting was overdone, the plot was so full of holes it may as well have been swiss cheese, the product placement was ad nauseam, and the length of the movie was just ridiculous. After 22 minutes worth of previews, you end up sitting in the theater for over 3 hours for a film that is clearly overproduced and underwritten. Yes, the transformers were cool. The action sequences and battles (at least the ones not involving Mark Walhberg almost single handedly taking out 40 foot war machines) were well done and the anger elicited by some of the Autobots felt genuine. Yes, Stanley Tucci's character is hilarious. TJ Miller and Tucci provided plenty of comedic relief and most of it felt on point... something a lot of apocalyptic action films miss on. YES, Nicola Peltz is absolutely stunning. Bay played the jail bait card with her throughout the movie, causing people in the audience to instantly Google her after the film, relieved that she's actually 19 years old so they no longer feel like pedophiles. And yes, Grimlock was freaking badass. Combine a love for dinosaurs with a love for awesome mechs and Grimlock is pretty much the coolest thing ever. But those handful of positives aren't enough to redeem a movie with terrible acting by the protagonist, a horrible plot, and over-edited and overproduced action. The movie wasn't horrible and was at least better than the third installment but it ultimately fails miserably to capture what made the first two films so great.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
146,virindra,"Very long, not that interesting.",6,6 July 2014,"I like the transformer movies. Especially because I grew up with the cartoons. I like the autobots and the decepticons. This movie was a bit different.It begins very wrong; This woman with a very annoying accent says ""History is about to change."" That's a line from someone with a narrow vision. You can only change history when you go back in the past via time-travelling. History is what it is. That the perception of it is about to change due to new evidence (dinobots), is something very different.The movie goes on to a family Yaeger (does this mean that due to Yaeger technology there will be a tranformers - Pacific Rim cross over?) who live in Texas. I never knew in the villages of Texas there only live girls who look like playmates. The father - daughter relationship is so obvious and boring. Yes father and daughter don't get along. We have seen this in many, yes many, Hollywood movies before. For example watch Armageddon. You know that during the movie the daughter gets respect for her father and so on.The movie is very long. This three hours movie isn't that interesting. Where are the old decepticons like starscream? How can an autobot be an airplane? How can a decepticon be a car? It does not make any sense. The transformers are not made of steal, that's why they are interesting for further analysis by men. How can they be magnetic then? Very weird movie.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
147,torstensonjohn,Addition Of Wahlberg Still Does Not Save This Movie,6,27 May 2018,"I have seen all of the Transformers film and this has to be one of the lowest in the franchise. The addition of Mark Wahlberg to boost star power was a nice touch but certainly did not save the film. His character is an inventor, witty, comical, hell bent on protecting his daughter. TJ Miller was a nice nugget until he bowed out so early in the film. 
It was a nice caveat that we saw Kelsey Grammer as the antagonist in the film as a defiant and power hungry CIA director. The continuity of the film kept with the franchise story but most of the autoboots are gone. Special effects as always drove the film to a higher rating. I wasn't in complete disappointment but as far as the franchise goes this laid an egg. There is action and some well thought out dialogue, firey scenes with the bots. Afternoon filler.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
148,Dragonsouls,"Don't take it seriously, just allow yourself to be entertained",8,3 October 2014,"I do admit, there were times that I rolled my eyes while watching this film because of all the cheesy comedic one-liners riddled throughout. But after some thought, I realized that this isn't a film with a serious tone and before anything, it was created to entertain--and also, to make you laugh.The script was surprisingly lighter in tone than the previous 3 installments and the acting felt more light-hearted as well. I believe this was intentional, and I noticed that this is becoming a pattern in Hollywood lately, in that many films are shedding the serious tone of some films, in order to cater to a broader audience--a younger audience if you will. However, I won't be entirely lenient here, because Mark Wahlberg was terrible in this film. He wasn't half as funny as Stanley Tucci was, nor did he display any sense of urgency whatsoever. The supporting cast did a better job that Wahlberg did.Despite all of my gripes, it would be next to impossible for a true Transformers fan such as myself to find disappointment in this film. There were some very memorable, spiritual lines, and just like the other films, there were all sorts of thought-provoking theological connotations implemented into the simple, but spiritually motivating plot. To top it off, ILM's CGI was the best its ever been. And did I mention the automobiles? This 4th installment in the franchise has some of the best ones!",Transformers - Age of Extinction

150,RichardSRussell-1,Nearly 3 Hours of Michael Bay Blowing Things Up,3,27 June 2014,"Transformers [4]: Age of Extinction (PG-13, 2:45, Imax, 3-D) — SF, biggie, sequelNo, 4 hours' worth would not have earned 4 stars.Many years ago, I saw a movie about the Crusades, told (naturally) from the perspective of the Christian West trying to ""civilize"" the blasphemous Musselmen who were profaning the Holy Land with their mere presence. (How much things have changed since the 12th Century, eh?) During a truce, Richard the Lion-Hearted hosted Saladin at a grand feast in his royal tent and, wanting to impress the infidel with his puissance, seized a broadsword and, with a single hack, clove a large, solid object in twain. Saladin politely applauded, then arose, flung a convenient filmy veil into the air, and held his curved blade edge up as the veil settled gently across it, hanging for just a moment before its own weight parted it cleanly. (Damascus steel, you know.)I was properly impressed at the time — and the level of respect the film-maker had accorded to Saladin also formed a lasting memory for me — but the real take-home point was that battles were not necessarily won with thud and blunder but sometimes with subtlety and finesse.Expect none of that from the nearly 3 hours of Michael Bay blowing things up in Transformers: Age of Extinction.Good things first. (It won't take long.) Yes, the movie was really loud, but it wasn't outright deafening, like its 2 immediate predecessors. A fast-talking, well buffed Mark Wahlberg was a distinct upgrade from Shia LaBeouf in the role of The Human We're Supposed To Care About. The 1st half-hour or so, the warmup that featured real human interaction, had some welcome goofy moments from screenwriter Ehren Kruger.OK, so much for that. Let's smash some things. Let's smash some more. Nope, not enuf, more! Is that all you've got? Smash some more. C'mon, sissies, more! Look, we've still got an hour left to go, let's get with it! Whack. Bash. Slam. Ka-blooie. Whang. Ba-doom. Crash. Whoom. Clang. Bzzzap. Brief interlude in the lab. Kapow. Blooey. Somehow we found ourselves in Hong Kong. Hack, hack, hack. Metal dinosaurs. Gratuitous fireworks. Stabby. Pokey. Scratchy. Scrapy. Rakey. Ships falling from the sky. Whangy. Rippy. Smash, smash, smash, smash, smash! Gentle ringing sound of circular object slowly spinning down. SMASH IT!!!Who are these giant robots? Apparently we're supposed to know in advance, because they're never properly introduced in the movie, and they move in such close-up and so confusingly and quickly (no cut longer than 3 seconds, lest Bay be accused of Attention Deficit Aversion) that we never have any idea of which of them is doing what to which others. I get the vague impression that there was supposed to be a 3rd group of them in addition to the 2 traditional ones, but really they're all indistinguishable from each other, except for a few who spout bad dialog a la the #3 henchthug in a 1947 gangster film. And those are, I surmise, the good robots.Oh, incidentally, there are some characters. The one that showed the most promise gets fried early. All the rest have the sort of good fortune and miraculous escapes that are the stuff of epic poetry, legends, and holy books. Then again 4-5 more times for good measure.You'd think it would be difficult to get bored with all this non-stop action roiling across the screen, but about 130 minutes in I found myself imagining Megatron sidling up to his director during a break in the filming and asking ""What's my motivation here?""

The graphics and special effects are very realistic, and unlike Part 3, the film is not draggy but very fast moving, especially the second half. It keeps you hooked at your seat.

152,Mivas_Greece,"The beggining of a new trilogy, the best and most mature Transformers movie, with excellent cinematography and soundtracks!",8,21 March 2021,"Fantasy/action movie. After the closure of the first Transformers trilogy, this film comes as the promising fresh start to a new trilogy. Apart from Optimus and Bumblebee, there's no other character from the previous movies, though there's a connection to the third film and the big fight in Chicago. The fourth film is The Age of Extinction for Transformers. After the great battle in Chicago, all cooperation with the Transformers is interrupted and a CIA team hunts down all Transformers. The only collaboration between the people and the CIA with Transformers is with Lockdown, a lone, merciless and experienced bounty hunter, who pursues Optimus. So the Age of Extinction is very pessimistic for all Transformers. A financialy struggling inventor with his daughter accidentally finds the wounded and weak Optimus and decides to help him, until he finally confronts the CIA and Lockdown and they all become fugitives. The new trilogy, though Bay's well-known humor remains, is much more serious and mature than the previous one. In place of the immature young Sam comes the engineer inventor Cade Jagger (Mark Wahlberg) who lost his wife early and raises his daughter alone, while CIA involvement and the impending annihilation of Transformers make things more dramatic. The film also brings some positive messages, even though it's an action movie. Also, the film was very well-crafted, filmed both in China and on the ice in Antarctica, while the extinction of dinosaurs was also linked to the plot of the movie (dinosaurs and landscape of the films were highly realistic, excellent work on that part too). Also, Megatron, although he returned as Galvatron, was much inferior in design to most films and remained in a second villain role, since the main villain was Lockdown. Still, in this film, one of the great weapons of the opponents was the huge alien ship, and one of the best scenes, the scenes with the skyscrapers, so it was very reminiscent of the third film and the huge robot drill in the skyscrapers. In the technical part of the film, Bay really surpassed himself and is giving ""directing lessons"". Excellent effects, unique shots, landscapes and scenery, as well as close-ups with perspective, slow motion scenes, and excellent filming on set, cinematography in its best! All this combined with top soundtracks by Steve Jablonsky and the unique masterpiece of Imagine Dragons, Battle Cry which was probably the best and most fitting track of the entire Transformers series, but also the relaxing and enchanting All for You. Age of Extinction was technically the best film of the entire Transformers series by far. Even if you haven't seen the previous trilogy, you can start with this movie and skip the intensely immature elements of previous movies, while enjoying great shots, great soundtracks and plenty of action.Personally, it's my favorite movie of all Transformers movies, though in scenario it's a little inferior to the third movie which was the most complete in my opinion.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
153,kunalkhandwala,"Another city destroyed, another excessive display of Bayism",6,13 July 2014,"Remember the long, random fight sequence between Peter Griffin and Ernie the giant chicken in 'Family Guy'? It was unnecessarily prolonged and gory but its randomness was what made it funny. With added special effects, budget and extravagance of destruction, the transforming robots seem to be stuck in such random ideas of the Bayworld and while their collective force brings occasional joy, it also creates a sense of nonchalance because the action sequences get long and repetitive. The spectacle of the flashy robots and cars aside, Bay hasn't quite created any distinction from the previous 3 installments. Granted, there are Dinobots in this version but by the time they appear, you've already disconnected from the happenings. The perpetual trait of portraying excess is taken to another level this time and of course it will have its side effects. Oh and somewhere in that plot is a reference to the 'Age of Extinction'.....The battle in Chicago between the Autobots and Decepticons caused devastation of such magnitude that the Government brought an end to the Autobots-U.S. Military operations and began an all out war to brutally destroy each of the alien robots. This assault is directed by CIA operative Attinger (Kelsey Grammar) whose secret aids include KSI's Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci), an astute businessman with technical capabilites to recycle the salvaged Tranformers into a flashy army of mercenaries and an unexpected bounty hunter from Cybertron, Lockdown. There is a reference to the creators of Transformers who had sent the bots to Earth before the ice age and they were in fact the ones who created autobots such as Optimus Prime. Lockdown's primary target is now the absconding leader of autobots who was accidentally revived by Cade (Mark Wahlberg), a freelance mechanic. During an unexpected raid by Attinger's operatives, Optimus escapes with Cade, his teen daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) and her boyfriend Shane (Jack Reynor). Along with the rest of the remaining Autobots, they infiltrate the KSI facility where they witness the procedure involving the meltdown of their fellow bots to create new Transformers. Dismissing such a cruel act, they leave the facility only to be confronted by Galvatron and Stinger (KSI Transformers) but in the middle of that battle, Optimus is shot by Lockdown and subsequently captured along with Tessa. As the Autobots attempt their rescue, it is learnt that Galvatron is a reincarnation of Megatron and his grand scheme is to seize the Seed and destroy mankind. The showdown in Hongkong involves Decepticons, Autobots, Dinobots, humans and Lockdown in a series of mind numbing, grandiose, occasionally breath-taking but overdrawn action sequences. Mark Wahlberg attempts to rise up from Shia Labeouf's disdainful overacting but frankly, there's little for humans in this robotic annihilation. Having filmed several sequences in IMAX 3D, Michael Bay really does show some spectacles. Not only are the sequences more detailed but the explosions and battles appear epic. The problem isn't with the excess of action when it is the primary reason for one's indulgence in this franchise. But when similar sequences are just directed to be bigger and longer, it doesn't add much to the excitement. Even the multiple sub-plots, new characters and Mark Wahlberg do not aid in salvaging Bay's approach of repetitive excess that offers little in terms of nuance. Meager attempts are made with the Dinobots sequence, Lockdown-Optimus battle, Galvatron chase and that epic entry of Lockdown with his spaceship in the backdrop. Bay's directorial liberty takes the final battle sequence through an hour of agonizing robot fights that we have seen in the previous 3 installments and it's easy to zone out with the length of the film having exceeded 150 mins already.Mark Wahlberg tries to inject some interest as the only human but the cheesy dialogues just don't suit him. Kelsey Grammar does well to portray malice rather than suave comedy and Stanley Tucci's manipulative Joshua is delightfully wicked.When it comes down to analyzing a Transformers movie, the focus of discussion must really be the visual effects and the action that involves the robots. Everything else is just a filler between more action and while Bay achieves the consistent result that even the audience has come to expect, he ends up with more and more fillers because there is too much action to showcase in 2 hours. Almost an hour of the movie is just wasteful. The true revival of this series must happen under a new director who can raise the level and engage the fans with nuance and coherence. Until then, China will help make a billion for this blockbuster and Bay, in his excitement, will start working on the script for his next version of extinction, annihilation and devastation till every city has been leveled.6.58 on a scale of 1-10.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

155,achyutaghosh,Old wine in new bottle,7,26 June 2014,"Giant fighting robots that can transform into hot wheels at the drop of a hat- hey, that is my kind of thing, even though Michael Bay has a lot to do with it. The first Transformers movie introduced us to the Autobots and the Decepticons- two eternally warring sides that, over three films, made earth their own devastating battlefield. Transformers also heralded a whole new breed of cinema- destruction porn- a PG13 rated CGI infused spectacle that believed that the level of on screen destruction was directly proportional to audience enjoyment and box office collections. Critically reviled, but universally loved- the first three movies made over USD 2.7 billion!To be fair, the human angle in these boyhood fantasy films was always the weak link, especially the last two movies that did more damage than good to the Transformers brand, and hence it warranted a reboot. In came new stars in Mark Wahlberg, Nicola Pelz, Jack Reynor, Stanley Tucci and Kelsey Grammar, and new writers who penciled in fan favorites- dinobots in addition to creating new villains, in a all new storyline. So is the fourth film necessarily better than its predecessors, even though it is just an uninvolving, blown up 3D summer blockbuster? Not as good as the first I say, but certainly better than the last two. The movie is set 5 years after the demolition of Chicago in Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Much like what we saw in X-Men: Days of Future Past, the US government have deemed all Cybertronians as threats, and elite CIA units are secretly hunting down and annihilating the remaining bots. In this pursuit, they are helped by Lockdown, a Cybertronian bounty hunter. At the start, we are treated to a genuinely shocking moment, where Ratchet gets torn to bits. Slowly. Naturally so, the Autobots are in hiding, and resentful of humans. Meanwhile, business tycoon Joshua Joyce (Tucci) and government agent Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammar) have unholy intentions- to build an army of Transformers which they can control. Galvatron here is not Unicron infused Megatron as it is in the books, but a human made transformer, created from Megatron's remains. But is the Decepticon leader really dead? Is Joshua really in control of his army? Walhberg is Cade Yaeger, a failed robot inventor, who comes across a beat up truck, which turns out to be a bitter and injured Optimus Prime. Cade helps him recover, and also helps restore Prime's faith in humanity. Optimus rallies his remaining Autobots- Bumblebee, Hound, Drift and Crosshairs and unleashes a group of legendary warriors- the monstrous, fire-breathing, Dinobots to defend mankind yet again from the mayhem unleashed Joshua's creations, and Lockdown's minions, including his super cool space-ship mounted magnetic weapon that lifts up massive metal objects from the ground and sea and drops them on targets.The good- stunning action set pieces throughout. The entire last hour is one long action shot. I have always liked the way Michael Bay focused on the mechanics of the Transformers- a whirring clockwork of gears and moving metal, but earlier the depictions have been too busy. In this movie, he has slowed these transformations further down, as a result the visual style is clean and uncluttered, every movement easily understandable. The script has some amount of humor, the music is good, and this star cast is definitely better than the previous one. These two factors should ensure a billion dollars at the box office. Dig deeper though, and the movie is as hollow as any of Bay's other movies.Fast cars and chases, lots of explosions, big guns, racial stereotyping, character stereotypes, and loads of American patriotism, in addition to doffing its hat and devoting almost a third of the movie to the 2nd largest movie market in the world- China. At 2.5 hrs run time, it is overlong by at least 20 minutes, and towards the end, the incessant action does get kind of exhausting.But hey, this is my kind of movie, I did not expect too much and as a result did enjoy it. Towards the end the 19 billion year old Optimus Prime again drapes on his overprotective clothes and flies off on an yet again solo, foolhardy mission to take on his ""creators"". I can't but wait for the next installment- 7/10",Transformers - Age of Extinction
156,abouhelier-r,Transformers: Age of Extinction,5,18 July 2014,"A mechanic inventor, his daughter and her boyfriend find themselves joining the Autobots as they are targeted by a bounty hunter from another world and Humans.Transformers: Age of Extinction is the fourth film of the Transformers franchise after 2007, 2009, 2011 movies; once again directed by Michael Bay. This time all the cast has changed and every former character is gone. Exit Shia Laboeuf replaced by Mark Wahlberg, his long blond hair and perfect make up (even if she never have access to make up throughout the film) daughter playing by Nicola Peltz and her boyfriend (Jack Reynor). In this case new cast doesn't mean new film. In fact this new Transformers is built in the same way as the first three movies; i-e at first shows off protagonist who are struggling against something, government interfere, then Optimus Prime comes in and fight, plus more governmental dialogues and finally the last 30/40 minutes of the film are nothing but explosions over and over again. Beside that point the major downfall in Michael Bay's movies is that there are to much idiotic humour, racial stereotypes and government conspiracy dimension (that no one really care about). However, Mark Wahlberg is actually the best part of the film. He's a pretty likable character at last. Plus he does things in the film, as grabbing an alien gun and getting involved in the battle. Unlike Shia Laboeuf who spent the entire first three films running and screaming around with his girlfriend(s). Other actors can't really been taken seriously especially Jack Reynor, his character is highly annoying and he didn't do anything to help the people he's surrounding with. They tried to focus on human characters more than Transformers but the problem is that they're quite boring. As a fan of summer big-budget movies and blockbusters in general I know why I'm walking into a theatre in order to see a Michael Bay movie. I don't care about cheesy dialogue and governmental conspiracy. That's probably why this film lost me somewhere in the middle of the second act. What I care about in Michael Bay' films are his amazing special effects and seeing Transformers rolling around and fighting! What disappoint me the most are the poorly constructed dialogues and that every action scenes look like THE big final battle of all time; Which lead me waiting for something much bigger towards the end of the film. Finally, Michael Bay never really cared about what critics and mostly everyone said about his films. Why? Simply because at the end I spent a good time, people applauded and it will make a hell lot of money... Overall, Transformers: Age of Extinction is visually good with amazing special effects and action sequences but when it comes to directing and filming actual real people it looks not that great. If you like those things you will love this movie!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
157,krycek19,I really HATE this movie,1,23 August 2014,"There is not one redeeming thing about this god damn piece of crap B movie. It's too long, it's boring, the action scenes are shaky and confusing, it's noisy and I fell asleep the second time I tried to watch it. And i can't tell this movie apart from the first three profoundly stupid Transformers movies. Michael Bay sucks!!This greedy a-hole is only making movies for the money. His movies has no hard, no soul. he has no stories to tell. Why this guy is still allowed to make his crappy movies is only because they do well at the box office.Everybody knows he's a lousy director unable to make a movie with a good script, good acting and a running time under two and a half hours. Two and a half hours where there is barely a story. Bay only knows how to make kids movies where he blows up buildings and destroys cities. He should be banned from Hollywood forever.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
158,diggnuts,A virtual lobotomy.,1,29 June 2020,"Michael bay movies are dumb by themselves which is compounded by the fact that Bay apparently thinks that his work actually has cultural value.

He actually tortures writers with these empty action extravaganzas.If this is you guilty pleasure. Fine..

160,chappywatched,Chappy Watched: Transformers: Age Of Extinction,1,28 May 2016,"I thought this movie would be vastly improved with the loss of Shia LaBeouf/Sam Witwicky from the sagaI was wrong.Say hello to newest addition to my Top 5 Worst Movies of All Time!In my entire cinema going experience, I have NEVER walked out of a movie (I always like to think that it could get better) but I definitely could have walked out of the cinema multiple times had it not been for the fact that I was there with a friend.The cast was crap, the characters aren't at all interesting with both Tessa Yeager (Nicola Peltz) and Lucas Flannery (T.J Miller) being really bloody annoying (I may have been praying for them to meet their end at the bottom of a transformers foot!) and a severe overuse of sun flares and sunset shots.At the end of the movie, it seems like they were trying to top the Man of Steel's destruction tally over multiple cities and there were some points where the movie was actually borderline racist.Transformers, like Godzilla, isn't a movie where you need to cast big names like Mark Wahlberg, who wasn't really convincing at all, because the robots should be the leads with maybe a few small roles for the humans.As long as Michael Bay continues to be apart of these movies, this will most definitely be my last Transformers movie and now I will most likely not be going to see him ruin Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.Don't go see it.

And was really looking forward to watching this one. It does some things right compared to previous parts and some things wrong. The movie takes place five years after the events of Chicago in Transformers 3. With all the chaos in that event, humans have decided to get rid of all the Transformers and are now hunting them. The old cast is gone, no more Witwicky family and stuff. Now we get Mark Wahlberg, who was good BUT his daughter and the boyfriend were really LAME. Micheal Bay never learns. Stanley Tucci character was somewhat good, his later role was merely comic relief though. The things that I liked in this movie were that the autobots this time had more of a personality, and how PRIME was pushed to the brink due to the situation at hand and thank GOD they got rid of the lame ass humor that plagued the last two movies. The villain, lockdown, was pretty badass. His first encounter with prime was one of my favourite scene. And then there is the Dinobot sequence, a full 6 mins or so scene of awesomeness. My favourite scene in the movie, pure goosbump inducing epicness that made me love these movies in the first place, awesome soundtrack too during the scene. On the bad side, the pacing was really all over the place. Some areas really bogged down the movie. Main reason for that was the ridiculous 2 hour and 40 mins runtime. They could have shaved 40 mins and made it a lot more compact and better, that and the lame human characters like daughter and boyfriend. Also, aside from two scenes that I really liked/loved, their wasn't that EPIC feel like I got from the previous three parts and the accompanying soundtrack wasn't that good either. The final fight was also a bummer, WHY OH WHY do they have to focus on humans so DAMN much, still haven't fixed that. CGI was great, as usual, but there were two/three scenes with human characters which made green screen pretty apparent and was distracting when everything else is so top notch. Soundtrack was good but not as good as previous parts. Had two great pieces though, ""Lockdown"" and ""Dinobots"".All the quirks aside, it was still an enjoyable experience, which I totally expected it would be. I would put it around the same as Revenge of the fallen. 7.5/10",Transformers - Age of Extinction

In this film, we follow Mark Wahlberg and Optimus Prime through a bunch of explosions, disappointing effects, and three major plots going at the same time for almost 3 hours. (165 minutes. -___-) -Now it was not as bad as Transformers: Revenge Of The Fallen, which laces as my least favorite film ever. However, Transformers 4 tried its hardest to be as bad.-The plot(s) were long and confusing and kinda dumb. One of them was humans making Transformers and then Megatron was alive or something and there was a bounty hunter transformer hunting Optimus because of the Transformer's creators or something like that. And Mark's family and stuff. And then dinosaurs. because REASONS!! -The pace of the film was meh. It should have ended 2 hours in and taken out either one of the 4 plots. I actually though it was ending 2 hours in, and then they went to China. Because they wanted to promote the film there and make more money.-Characters: well Mark Wahlberg did well (most of the time) and the others were all okay. Kelsey Grammar actually did a great job. But The typecast agent and Stanley Tucci's characters were SOOOO dumb. Michael Bay tried to hard to make them guys from the first movies.-The music was bland. There were some 10 songs from one band they played, which did bother me some. Literally one started playing in an action scene. Thanks for that editors. And the score was completely forgettable! Like I don't remember it at all. The theme played once and it was cool.-Effects were bad.-There were moments I laughed out loud at some of the lines that were just bad. Yeah. I did laugh once at a good line and was entertained a few times, but not by the dinobots, which were stupid. Not like Pacific Rim was awesome-stupid. Like they were just dumb and not cool in any way. Like the action! Or robots! Or the film.-Content was better. There was 1 f-word and a few other minor words, but no typical Michael Bay sex references everywhere. Unless you counts all the hundreds of explosions.-So Transformers: Age Of Extinction was really bad. I don't have anything more to say about it. I would give it a 5/10 and say it is not worth seeing. Ever.-So did you see Bayhem 4? What did you think? As soon as there was en explosion (45 seconds in) I thought ""I think we just found a Transformer(s movie)!

166,FilmMuscle,The Definition of Dumb Fun,5,3 July 2014,"Most filmmakers would surely try to improve their sequels and dig themselves out of the shameful, dubious dirt they've negligently and smugly dug themselves into—well, certainly not the egomaniac that is Michael Bay. Instead, he decides to go even bigger with this fourth installment in one of the most profitable movie franchises to date. In fact, it's an even clearer Michael Bay film with an increase in slow-mo sequences, sunset shots, and—of course—explosions. Age of Extinction begins five years after the disastrous events of its predecessor: the colossal battle that was waged in Chicago which inflicted even greater destruction onto the city than what happened to Metropolis in last year's Man of Steel. All transformers have become the hunted; Autobots have now been paired with the Decepticons as patent hazards to humanity. Optimus Prime has been abandoned by the people he sought to protect, as well as the others of his kind who he once led into battle. When an energetic inventor (Mark Wahlberg) discovers that the truck he just brought home to his barn in Texas is really Optimus Prime himself, a major task is laid out at his feet—an undertaking that would hopefully lead to his daughter's (Nicola Peltz) safety and an escape from the CIA's eye. To stream a little positivity into my overview of this blockbuster, I'd have to honestly say that it's at least better than the last two entries in the series. While it's far behind the first Transformers, there were some brief moments throughout its lengthy duration that were able to recoup that larger-than-life fun (that of which excelled the original) for a few minutes. Sitting at a not-too-shabby 165-minute runtime, the flick featured countless action segments—some of which truly reminded me of something out of Halo, including a rescue attempt inside a grandiose and enemy-infested spaceship with the assistance of some remarkable alien weapons. Whereas Megatron stood as the only considerable threat in the first three, this one sees an influx of villains from the menacing CIA agents and corporate suits to the powerful new Decepticon named Lockdown and a company-replicated version of Megatron called Galvatron. The story seems to be so painfully stretched out in order to give each of them proper screen time. And still, despite the fact that the Transformers franchise is supposed to be a series of dumb summer blockbuster fare, the narrative is dramatically more convoluted than it should be. In between the graphically intense action, we're left confused as to what exactly our protagonists are even doing. What is their goal? Usually, as a method to ignorantly simplify, we just assume that it's another blatant conflict between the Autobots and Decepticons. The more intricate details and backstory in those conflicts are always incoherent and messily developed. First, it was a cube with an obnoxiously complicated history, and this is the issue with these movies: rather than utilize that prolonged length to effectiveness (like—I don't know—clarifying the characters' goals and the background specificities in this totally cluttered disorder), the entire span of these narratives are wasted for yet additional action-packed fodder. Moreover, as much as the fanboys of the Transformers cartoons and action figures desire more focus on the transformers themselves, that usually leads to more fights and then some more. No, what these flicks really need is a smart balance between the humans and the Transformers themselves—a balance between some nicely-executed drama/humanity and the volatile magnitude that the transformers provide. Wahlberg is definitely a downgrade from LaBeouf as much as the biased haters love to say otherwise because the ultimately relatable and goofy teenager (which contributed to so much of the fun in the original) is replaced by a generic, hunky action star. Now, this is not an insult to Wahlberg—he's a terrific actor when he chooses to be and when he picks the right projects, but his character here is nothing more than the caring-father- turned-asskicker. Then, we have the standard pretty boy with an unidentifiable accent; although he was supposed to be Irish, I detected an Australian accent at times and occasionally a Southern American accent as well. With that being said, the central female character in Transformers 4 is undeniably superior to the ones in the past. Nicola Peltz brings that cute, vulnerable aura to the female role as opposed to the airheaded, plain hotness that both Megan Fox and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley depicted in the Transformers franchise. She's certainly more attractive in that regard as well, and not to mention, she can actually act. With the material she was given, Peltz carried herself surprisingly well, considering her part in what's supposed to be a mindless action bonanza. Simply put, she was far more lovable and endearing than the two soulless ""models"" in the previous chapters—a harsh but truthful opinion, I know. When it comes to the rest of the film, the amazing score that at least benefited the other three was absent here, and the Linkin Park track was nowhere to be found too. While I love Imagine Dragon's ""Battle Cry,"" the song was seriously mismatched and unneeded in this case, offering for some awkward transitions and mixings with the action on-screen. The song's build-up pervaded most of the scenes it found itself in but its chorus was rarely heardto much disappointment.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

It sinking so fast I can't believe it whole direction are star cast are going down with every film.When I had watched the trailer my expectations were too high but it fulfilled only 60% expectations of mine I will give 6/10 to this flick.The good things which I like were the action sequences and the 3D vfx and visual effects.I will say that please take this franchise to a new level if any sequel is coming then please make it awesome.,Transformers - Age of Extinction
169,ssvfolder-1,Terminator 3 all over again,4,25 September 2014,"Transformers can be fun. It actually can make mediocre stars, like Shia and Mega, but this movie does exactly the opposite. I wander, how exactly Michael Bay allowed this catastrophe to be filmed and shown. It's as he doesn't care about the legacy of this great franchise. Truly reminded me of Terminator 3 fiasco. Acting is bad. Real bed. There is not even one actor in this movie that worth to watch. Wahlberg's portrayal of Inventor, ""sort of white trash"" Texas simpleton, father to some hot young girl, who btw can't act for s..., is nothing short of ridiculous. Everybody else, including usually great Kelsey Grammar were just bad. The story lacks everything. It's not interesting, it does not suit previous three movies (I mean two of them weren't good, but at least they had running logic). It's boring and entire movie relies on special effects. Robots became more human-like, except for ever-charming bumble bee, but still his behavior became stupider than before. Waste of time. From now on, I'll choose Wahlberg's and Bay's movies more carefully. Gave this one a 4, because of god special effects. That's it.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

I would love to say it is a great movie to eat along with but if you have to watch what you're eating you will miss tons of action, so don't unless you can stuff your face with food without looking.OK so it has story for a brain dead, it tries to be funny and it fails... so what!? It is still great popcorn movie with the best visuals you will ever see up to date! Almost everyone hates it for no real reason... I mean wtf did you expect!?

171,bravesfanc,The trailer misleads you,6,5 July 2014,"When I saw the trailer for this movie I got my hopes up. It seemed like it was going to be a movie with a decent plot and maybe a more darker film than the three previous installments. Also, with Mark Wahlberg taking over the main acting lead over Shia Labeouf, it's an instant upgrade.Sadly, all these expectations were too high and because of that I didn't enjoy the movie as much. I think the main thing was the running time of almost 3 hours. There was a lot that could've been left out and while the special effects were great, the dialogue going along with it was downright laughable.Despite my complaints I give it a 6/10 because even though it was too long and most of the dialogue was terrible, I was able to look past it because quite frankly when you watch a Transformers movie I don't watch it for the plot, I watch it for enjoyment. I enjoyed the action scenes and the special effects. Even though most of Mark Wahlberg's lines were bad, he is still able to deliver it in a way that had me laughing more times than not.It was a disappointment, but watch it for the action and the comedy. If you go in with that mindset, you'll enjoy it a lot more than you normally would.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
172,rcolgan,The same mindless plots repeated again,3,8 July 2014,"This is the 4th time that Michael Bay has recycled the exact same film now, but it still has not dipped at all in popularity. Whilst it's not the worst film in the franchise, Age of Extinction does not deserve the popularity that the film has got. It's nothing but the same repetitive mess of weak characters and emotionless action that has become far too common place in Bays films. It brings nothing that we haven't already seen before from the franchise. Everything wrong with the first trilogy is still wrong here. Bay maintains all the typical things that audiences hate of the franchise including gratuitous slow mo, unfunny jokes that are more cringe worthy than they are funny and an overstretched story that is far too long. On top of this once again the plot is filled with plot holes and things that don't make sense. Characters seem to disappear between scenes and humans can be thrown through buildings and not even take a scratch. At times some characters will even disappear between shots. For a 200 million dollar budget film to still have flaws in continuity like this is just insulting. The only real change from the previous trilogy is a new set of characters. This time it focuses on Wahlberg, an inventor who finds Optimus and fixes him. Whilst he's not great, Wahlberg is a step up from Laboeuf by actually being likable. This is entirely to Wahlbergs credit who embraces the films ludicrous nature quite well. Unfortunately though he's the only tolerable character added. All the other characters fall into the standard Michael Bay style of taking any charm and making them unfunny or irritating. By far the most annoying additions are Wahlbergs daughter and her boyfriend. I find this hard to say, but Nicola Peltz is even worse than Megan Fox. Every time the camera cuts to her she's doing nothing but screaming, complaining or looking pretty. By the end of the film she was so bad that I actually wanted Fox back. At least Fox had some personality and independence beyond screaming at the camera (even if it wasn't much). Peltz's boyfriend wasn't much better either with one of the least convincing Irish accents put to film and a cowardly nature that may be intended as comedic but will just make you hate him even more. At points I even started rooting for the bad guys because he was just that irritating. On top of this three new autobots are introduced in the film, all of whom are unfunny or offensive. There's Crosshair played by John DiMaggio, who we hardly even see and doesn't impact anything other than taking part in some fights being more of a place filler than anything else. Goodman plays Hound, an over the top American who's got a distinct but ugly design and mostly spends his time spouting unfunny jokes. Then there's Watanabes Drift, who casually mocks many Japanese traditions and applies stereotypes just as we've come to expect from Bays work. Drift may not be as bad as the Autobots in Revenge of the Fallen but is still an irritating and offensive character. Bumblebee and Optimus are the only returning transformers from the first trilogy. They're both alright, but just like most other things in this franchise we've seen everything they do here before. Bumblebee doesn't get much screen time and the short time he has just uses the same overused joke of speaking with the random film clips. Optimus just does the usual hero routine he always does. He's still one of the only tolerable characters in the film but his motivational speaking and leadership feel more like an overused routine for him at this point. The fans seem to tolerate the annoying characters and weak story because they just love the mindless fights that much. In fact they seem to be the only reason that these films are such a hit at the box office. I'll admit the effects are impressive as long as you like the designs and seeing robots fight it out can be fun if done right. But the problem is with Bay at the helm we hardly get to see them. Instead of watching the robots fighting, we focus on people running away from the fight and can hardly see what's going on half the time. It's like going to the theatre and spending the whole time looking at the back of someones head. Besides, we've seen these fights all before. Albeit this time they did add some Dinobots (even if they do only appear in the last 30 minutes) but they don't really change much. They do lead to one or two cool shots of Optimus riding a dinosaur. But that's like putting a picture up to cover a hole in the wall. It's still the same camera-work, explosions and robot punching blended together.Other than the introduction of Walberg nothings really improved for the franchise. It's still the same overused conventions we've seen in the previous 3 films just copied and pasted here. If you really want to watch it you may as well just re-watch the first one and you could get the same experience.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
173,anthonyf94,Michaelbaychian,5,30 August 2019,"The fourth chapter of ""Transformers"" franchise signs a kind of little reboot, changing actors and characters. But this doesn't manage to improve the saga that remains giant and noisy entertainment cinema. In particular, in this movie the narrative structure is composed by two oppositions, good and bad men and good and bad aliens, with the interference between the teams. They are treated themes like familiar problems (father, daughter and daughter's boyfriend), alien invasion and especially the problem of identity and origin of life for these living machines. But all this inputs are just put in a too much long cup without a real examination of psychologies and without a strong plot: we can see the movie pass from a fast and furious-like car film to actions to catastrophic epopea. In all these cases the aim is just to entertain superficially the spectator with explosions and apocalyptic fights that are the true (the only) quality of this movie. As the others: there a lot of worse action or sci-fi mainstream movie, but the entire Transformers saga is weak and commercial. Two words: Michael Bay.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
174,rjsf96,Bay's Films Should Stay Extinct,3,12 March 2015,"This is technically my second review of 'Transformers: Age of Extinction'. I will be completely honest, the first time I viewed it I was far too kind and even gave it a recommendation. Please find it in your heart to forgive me. I can only attribute my mind at that time to what I call 'Quantum of Solace' syndrome. I wanted to like it so much that I convinced myself it was a good movie. Now I can safely say that it is not. It sadly cannot even rise to a guilty pleasure status. It takes thirty minutes for the gravel voiced Optimus Prime to make an appearance. Even he has no desire to be here. Well, that makes two of us.First things first the positives; they are extremely minor so I will sum them up in this paragraph. The music would sound serviceable, but I can never hear it because of all the crunches, crashes and bashes of endless waves of undiscernible robots colliding and looking like a junkyard having hard core sex. My ears are still bleeding. If you are wondering, yes the fight scenes still suck, you never can tell who is fighting who and you just end up looking away before you vomit. They made me want to cower in a corner and cry, until my parents reassured me that everything would be alright. This is because the fight scenes are a repetitive, never ending assault on your eyes, ears and brain.However, Stanley Tucci makes for a fun character to watch, if just to see him change from the executive to running away from a Transformer. Yet he has no character development, just like everyone else, as the film ends he slowly morphs back into the corrupt leader he was at the start of the film. What a stupid idea that was scriptwriter! Oh no, I'm being silly now, the Transformers franchise doesn't have one, they make it up as they go along! The only way I can imagine wanting to watch this film, is if it was edited down to a runtime of five minutes with Tucci as the lead. Instead he gets about two minutes screen time in a 165 minute movie. Nothing could be clearer, Bay doesn't give a damn. He is literally giving the audience the middle finger.The plot, wait there is one? Takes a staggering 2 hours to kick in and by that time any intelligent viewer has long switched their brain off, so that they don't lose brain cells. If you somehow can figure out half of what is going on, then well done you! Give yourself a pat on the back. Incoherent does not begin to cover this mess. Cade Yeager is an inventor played goofily by Mark Wahlberg. He is due on his rent and only has his daughter for company; when one day he comes into contact with a truck at an abandoned theatre. Talk about plot contrivances. This truck is none other than a rusty Optimus Prime. The next 150 minutes are incomprehensible bullsh*t; with Yeager, his daughter and her boyfriend teaming up with the Autobots. They have to stop the Decepticons and take back the ""seed"" before Tucci's Joshua Joyce uses it to create his own Transformers. How irritating, dumb, loud, long and boring this film is. For 'Age of Extinction' seeing is believing. But in this case it is not even worth watching, to be astounded by its blandness, rudeness and badness.How can a film released in the summer of 2014 with a 12A certificate get away with this absurd level of misogyny? Take into account the scene in which Yeager asks his seventeen year old daughter why she has a twenty year old boyfriend. The jock tells Yeager that they are protected by the Romeo and Juliet law of Texas. Is this Michael Bay's idea of comedy? I'm not laughing. So paedophilia is alright with this guy? To be honest I'm not that surprised. Why? Because when we first see Yeager's daughter the camera is practically looking up her skirt. We should be worried about what message this is giving our young, impressionable and gullible kids.It's actually very telling that Bay believes that his audience does not possess a working brain. This is just the first fifteen minutes! Somehow, it all gets more and more horrific as the whole bloated affair drags, never wanting to end. The dialogue is infantile at best with lines like ""Sweetie hand me my alien gun"" or this classic ""My face is my warrant"". I ended up slapping myself in the face. My nine year old cousin is capable of more intelligent dialogue! Bay should have hired him to write the script. To highlight how dumb this instalment is watch the opening sequence. We see icebergs, frozen terrain and snow. We are informed that this place is the Arctic. No sh*t.Oh and the product placement, racism and sexism prevalent in the previous three films? It is all still here. This saga now runs over six hundred minutes in length, in Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey', we witness the birth of man to a new civilisation in 150 minutes. I wonder which one has more craft. I'll leave that up to you to decide. Michael Bay has not learnt a thing. Why films like this can gross a billion dollars internationally and 'Edge of Tomorrow' barely breaks even, just shows how much cinema has deteriorated in the past decade. Thank Bay's immaturity and diabolical film making for that! At the start Optimus Prime announces that ""The rules have changed"". No Bay they have stayed exactly the same. 'Age of Extinction' is without a doubt the worst Transformers film ever made, the worst Michael Bay film ever made and the worst film of the twenty first century. Congratulations Michael, you have destroyed cinema, again.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
175,MattBirk,Surprisingly Disappointing..........is that Surprising?,3,18 January 2016,"The 4th installment of the Transformers saga brings absolutely nothing new to the table in this dreadful series. The Transformers once again are mad at their human counterparts who are trying to destroy the Autobots yet again, but are forced to work together to fight off the Deceptions. I'm tired of seeing our government trying to regulate an alien species, it worked in the first film, but now it has become tiresome. What Extinction does promise (Grimlock/Dinobots), it doesn't even deliver, they are hardly in the movie. A complete waste of time, if you have seen the first movie, you've seen them all.And what ever happened to their unique powers so to speak, the first transformer we ever see, takes down an entire military base, 3 movies later they can barely fight off a few soldiers? I was expecting Michael Bay to change the formula a bit because of all the criticism over the years and figured he would have a few new tricks up his sleeves.....sadly I was mistaken. Hopefully, Mark Wahlberg moves on from the franchise to focus on other projects.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
176,vistheindian,"Explosions, explosions, MORE EXPLOSIONS!",5,14 July 2014,"Quickie Review:Michael Bay returns to direct yet another movie in the Transformers franchise, with a brand new cast that includes Mark Wahlberg, Nicola Peltz, Jack Reynor, and Stanley Tucci. After the events of Transformers 3, both the Autobots and the evil Decepticons are being hunted down by a bounty hunter transformer known as Lockdown. Meanwhile the humans are cooperating with Lockdown to gain control of new technology and forces that may end all life on Earth. This is a franchise that is known for its visual effects, and not so much for its script and storytelling. Unfortunately and not surprisingly, this continues to be the case with this new movie. Transformers AoE is a bloated mess of a movie that disappoints even the most managed of expectations. Full Review:Of all the Transformer movies, I actually enjoyed the first one because at the time it was very different from anything we've seen before. But since then, the quality of the movies have been deteriorating fast. So when they announced this fourth movie with a new cast, I was cautiously optimistic because this could be the perfect chance for them to try new things that make the movie better overall. Turns out, I was very very wrong.Despite the fact I disliked Transformers AoE, there are a few things that I do think were done well. Visual effects as expected is really good. Unlike in the previous movies where shaky-cam is used for all action scenes, there are more wide view shots this time around. So you can actually see all the fight scenes in full detail. The best part of the movie is the new villain Lockdown. He actually felt like a menacing threat, because he doesn't rely on his minions or recruits. He likes to get into the thick of it all. I would've like to have seen more of him than the secondary villains they introduce in the movie.Now, the juicy bit of this review, the negatives. I could rant about this all day but I'll constrain myself (unlike the movie). This movie is almost 2hr 45mins long... completely unnecessary. All it did was give Michael Bay more time to make sure he does everything from his ""Bay's filmmaking checklist."" Random models for eye-candy – check. Low angle slow motion shots of people exiting vehicles – double check. Spinning camera around the main actors as they stare off to somewhere – triple check. Awkwardly placed attempts at jokes – quadruple check. Explosions – INFINITY CHECK. Seriously at this point Michael Bay and the Transformers franchise has become a parody of themselves. As for the new cast, Mark Wahlberg and Stanley Tucci were the only ones that were tolerable. Nicola Peltz, who plays Wahlberg's daughter and her boyfriend in the movie Jack Reynor, honestly have no purpose. Maybe they were supposed to bring some human dramatic weight (I chuckled just now as I wrote that), but no, they are just there to give the hormone filled teenagers something to drool over.Please be smarter than me and avoid this movie. You could start watching two movies that are 10x better and still not reach Transformer AoE runtime. If you are going to avoid my warning and go watch with the mentality of ""I don't care about the story I just want some action,"" be careful what you wish for because afterwards you will never wish for it again.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",Transformers - Age of Extinction

178,CowherPowerForever,A new era has begun. The age of the Transformers is over,3,28 June 2014,"My review for Transformers: Age of Extinction will in fact contain spoilers, so do not read if you would not like to be spoiled.The Transformers are back for their fourth outing, and maybe the worst of the bunch sadly. Having watched the trailers, and having the opinion Dark of the Moon was the best in the franchise, I really felt the series was going to keep getting better. Sadly my hopes were dashed after watching the newest Transformer film. This film has a lot of similar problems that the second film had, minus the overloading of the humor. I will go into more detail in the upcoming paragraphs. This is my review of Transformers: Age of Extinction Ehren Kruger, who was a co-writer on the big mess that was Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen and the only writer on Dark of the Moon, is back for another outing. I really praised his work on Dark of the Moon, it wasn't anything perfect of course, but it was a giant step in the right direction over Revenge of the Fallen. Sadly with this film he has fallen back into the awfulness that was Revenge of the fallen. The characters aren't as over the top with their humor like in the second film, but the story is worse in my opinion. Minor plot holes are expected in films like this, and I understand that, but when you set major precedent early in the film, then ignore it later on, that is a problem in my book. I am speaking of Galvatron when I say that. Early in the film Cade Yeager(Mark Wahlberg) buys an old beat up truck at an old movie theater that was closing down. He takes it home and then realizes that it is an Autobot. Once this Autobot transforms we come to know that it was in fact Optimus Prime. As Yeager is helping to repair Prime he mentions that the all spark is his life line, with his memories and everything. Now comes the major plot whole with Galvatron. Later in the film it is said that Galvatron was not created by the scientists, but by Megatron's head, whom the scientists kept around to experiment on. Which is a flat out contradiction. Which brings me to another huge problem in my opinion of course. Why not finally give us fans what we really want? It is well known that in the past Unicron created Galvatron. The masses of Transformer fans want Unicron in a live action film, and time and time again we have been shafted. So, overall the writing is bad with massive plot holes, and really big head scratchers.Michael Bay is back with another effort, and I must say the effort is fairly poor. After the lackluster action scenes in the second film, Bay stepped up his game in the third film, however they took a big step back in this film. This film is roughly twenty minutes longer than Dark of the Moon, yet it easily felt like there was less action overall with the Transformers. It easily felt like the human on human fighting took up more time. Now when the action picks up in spots with the Transformers, the scenes are fantastic, especially with the new IMAX 3D camera Michal Bay used. I also thought the acting was overall fair, and thus a big upgrade over the other films. Mark Wahlberg is not really known as a great actor, however I do feel he holds movies together nicely, and the same could be said here, although the awful writing in the plot details is something he couldn't help.Steve Jablonsky scored this film, previously worked on the last two Transformer films, and I must say this is without a doubt the best scored film yet. In the bigger action scenes, the score builds very nicely, and sounds amazing when in an IMAX theater.Overall this effort was sadly pretty poor, and easily the worst(you could say second worst and I might not disagree depending on mood) of the franchise. With a batting average of five hundred through four films, and showing clear signs of ignoring popular characters, this franchise needs to be put to sleep for the time being, until they can bring in a crew who actually has respect for the classic characters. Hardcore fans of Transformers will run to see this film, the rest should probably just wait it out for home video.Very quickly I will also talk about the IMAX and the 3D. Michael Bay shot this film using the new IMAX 3D camera, and while I didn't enjoy the film, the full screen IMAX scenes are truly amazing, and the 3D adds some nice depth. This is without a doubt one of the better IMAX 3D films visually that I've ever seen, and it is worth the extra money if you really want to see this film.3/10",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Heck, i liked PAIN AND GAIN and REVENGE OF THE FALLEN, and i don't find many people willing to fess up to that. Colour me surprised to find that i hated AGE OF EXTINCTION. Absolutely hated it. There was one single likable character in the movie and they killed him a quarter of the way into the movie. I never thought i'd see the day where i missed the presence of Megan Fox, but man oh man Nicola Peltz makes Megan Fox look like Meryl Streep. Jack Reynor's character is unbearably written. He's in a relationship with an underager, and that's his most LIKABLE quality? Geeze. You don't really appreciate the charisma of Shia Laboeuf till you find yourself having to root for THIS guy. I would have been quite happy to see either of the 2 young lovers bite it. In fact it would have made the movie better had they both gone down! Has Kelsey Grammar EVER shown up in a GOOD movie? I kinda feel bad for the guy, cause he's a solid enough actor but his theatrical choices have been horrid. I guess the one thing you can usually count on in a BAY movie is some very well-executed action sequences, which is possibly the greatest letdown of this film. The action sequences are just poorly edited together and incoherent. There is one chase down the side of a building where Wahlberg starts at the top, FALLS at least 5 stories, and yet the next shot his him on the 2nd story from the top again. Its amateurish to the extreme! And Transformium? What? I have never seen a more blatant cash-grab of a movie then this one. It is phoned in all the way down the line.

184,TheSeaLion,This series should be brought to extinction,1,29 June 2014,"Arguably the worst movie in the Michael Bay ""Transformers"" franchise (though I'm leaning towards ""Revenge of the Fallen"" being the worst), ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" seems to be the ""Transformers"" movie that is trying to take a darker turn with the material of giant robots fighting each other. The autobots are being hunted down one by one by a government team that has affiliated itself with businessman Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci) and a Transformer mercenary named Lockdown (Mark Ryan). While it does make attempts at having a darker story, interesting and complex characters, and thrilling action, the movie ultimately succumbs to the same stupidity and problems Michael Bay movies usually fall to. Starting off five years after the Battle of Chicago shown in ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"", autobots are now viewed as a menace towards the human race and are being hunted down. With the deaths of autobots Ratchet (Robert Foxworth) and Leadfoot (John DiMaggio), the number of remaining autobots has dwindled down to five, including Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) and Bumblebee. Lockdown is helping the humans hunt down the autobots so that he can capture Optimus Prime and bring him to the creators. Inventor and single dad Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) discovers Prime with his obnoxious, ""comic-relief"" delivering friend Lucas (T.J. Miller). Upon the discovery of Prime, the government agency comes to the farm to collect Prime, but Prime, Cade, Cade's daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz), and Lucas manage to escape with the help of Tessa's boyfriend Shane (Jack Reynor). Prime brings them to where the remaining autobots, which consists of Bumblebee, Drift (Ken Watanabe), Crosshairs (John DiMaggio), and Hound (John Goodman). They form a plan together to figure out who is behind the ordered extinction of the autobots and how deep the plot goes.While all of the the other ""Transformers"" movies had plots with complex elements to it, ""Age of Extinction"" has the most complex and hard to follow plot of them all. Joyce's company melts down the autobot bodies for their metal so he can create similar robots that his company can control and sell to people. Then, Lockdown wants Prime to bring back to the creators and will give the humans a device called the Seed in exchange for Prime. The Seed can turn organic matter into the same metal that the autobots are made from so that Joyce can continue to make his products. However, one of Joyce's robots named Galvatron (Frank Welker), who is Megatron in a different body, wanted the Seed to be brought to earth so that he could use it to create a new army of deceopticons. If you're annoyed by how needlessly complex this movie's plot is then that makes two of us.There is strangely a large amount of unnecessary characters in this movie. Surprisingly, Galvatron, who is the main antagonist of the third act of the movie, is a completely pointless character while Lockdown should have been the main antagonist of the last third of the movie. Joyce has an assistant (Bingbing Li) and an archaeologist (Sophia Myles) who serve no purpose in the movie. Luckily, to the movie's credit, Lucas, the obnoxious comic-relief who is usually shoe-horned into movies like this, is killed off when what his character could do is through. Joyce is the only character in the whole film to be complex, and because of that you do like his character, but coming towards the end of the movie, he becomes the comic relief that just whines and needs constant help.The addition of the new autobots doesn't make sense when you think about it either. All of the main autobots, with the exception of Prime and Bumblebee, are new to the franchise. So, that would mean they were on earth for a while and never decided to help the autobots, or they arrived after the Battle of Chicago when the autobots were being hunted down. While I do like two of the new autobots, their addition makes little sense to the logical side of the story.The effects in this movie, while not terrible, are a clear step down from the other ""Transformers"" movies. The autobots, especially Optimus, look completely fake, and when Galvatron and the other decepticons created by Joyce's company transform, it looks terrible.The action sequences are varying and do look impressive, but after a while you just become numb to it. There is a firefight that takes place in Chicago and it feels like it's going to be the end of the movie, but it's only the end of the second act. With a few redeemable qualities, but stuffed with either pointless or boring characters, an overly complicated plot, and annoying comic relief, ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" is arguably the worst of the franchise. I have a legitimate question that I want to ask: Why can't we just have a ""Transformers"" movie where the decepticons want to do something bad and the autobots and humans have to stop them? Why can't it just be that simple? With now four movies to show the quality of the ""Transformers"" movies, I think it's obvious that the series should just stop.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Aliens succeeded as an action film because you cared for the characters - this new Transformers film fails at every level but will make a ton of money because Hollywood is programming us to want more bang bang thud thud. Some cold turkey is required to get mainstream audiences off it. Films as bad as this are like substance abuse,Transformers - Age of Extinction
186,ahegde3149,Too much of anything is good for nothing.,1,20 September 2014,"The same is the problem with all the Michael Bay's Transformers movies (except maybe the first one). There is so much action forced in which is really frustrating as most of the times the action is simply filler of special effects and doesn't add anything to the story. People who have not seen any special effect loaded movies ever may be amazed but the script here is truly terrible. Moreover, the financial success of these films is giving even more boost to the director for spawning mindless sequels. Fortunately this one has under grossed compared to Dark of the Moon, hope Mr.Bay gets the message at least this time that audience have had enough.Even though I found the movie very bad movie overall, but the first about 1 hr. was quite good thanks to the good screen presence of Mark Wahlberg. I was thinking this might just end up being my favorite film in the franchise but I was completely wrong.The later 1 and half hours are complete waste of time with unnecessary advances in the plot,bad reveal of answers to the suspense or events built up in first half and of course ""The Final Act"" of special effect nonsense. The script was bland with not even a single memorable line in its bloated length of 165 min.The acting was bad, except Wahlberg as the lead no one else was able to give even a justifiable act.Even the special effects this time around weren't quite great (they were not quite blending into the environment especially towards the end with the dinobots).The Autobots were designed nicely mainly Optimus Prime but the enemies lacked the villainous touch. Also the multi-villain plot leads to non-focused development of the story (similar to amazing spider-man 2 earlier this year). The major problem as always is that the movie is not centered on the Transformers themselves but gives more time for the humans involved. At least this time aroud the lead human character is better(finally no witwicky nonsense). We don't get to know much about the new Autobots in the film accept the fat one(Hound). Similarly the so-called creators and knights are kept quite mysterious. Also during the action sequences its not clear who is hitting who thus robbing the fun. These problems are redundant in the franchise.The music and sound effects are quite appreciable though.The length could have been easily reduced to within two hours, which would have yielded much better result. This one was better than the Revenge of the Fallen but falls short of Dark of the Moon as it showed some good autobots-decepticons showdown in a much focused plot. The Transformers(2007) is still the best in the franchise. Even though it was just an average movie but certainly preferable Transformer movie compared to its 3 bad sequels. Even though I wanted this franchise finish off with Dark of the Moon as a trilogy, but now Mr.Bay plans for another trilogy we can only hope for a miracle that will generate a good Transformers film. The commercial success of the series will certainly go down if that doesn't happen.I hope that happens and I am no way interested in Transformers 5.Rating:[1.5/5]",Transformers - Age of Extinction
187,mwcrunner,I'm now sick and tired of the Transformers movies,2,18 August 2016,"This is the last I will ever see of the Transformers movies. Michael Bay should just quit while he's ahead. I mean 3 movies is enough, but this takes the cake. I mean we've all seen the earth saved by the Autobots in the first one, but apparently to Bay it was not enough. He just kept making these movies cause he thinks that these movies are so great. Well the first one was really good and then there came all these freaking sequels which aren't as good as the first one and this one is the worst of all. I can also tell that the Autobots in this movie are tired of doing these movies cause Optimus Prime says We're done protecting the humans meaning that he's tired of doing all these dumb movies. Also why does Bay have to have Galvatron in this movie? He was voiced by the legendary Leonard Nimoy and he was the best Galvatron ever. Also another thing, Autobots do not kill humans and Optimus just killed a human being in this film. WTF. Also where the hell was Optimus Prime going in the middle of space? The ending to this movie leaves a plot hole. I mean isn't everybody getting sick of these movies or are most Transfomers fans too stupid to realize it? I mean everyone loved the 80's cartoon and I like that cartoon as well and I'm not an 80's kid. I was born in 1991. I do however respect Peter Cullens voice acting and he will always be the best voice for Optimus Prime. Still this movie has meaningless action and a plot hole at the end.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
188,valen060,"Falls short of its 2007 predecessor, yet impresses by looking more into the Transformers Universe",8,27 June 2014,"When word got out that director Michael Bay had a fourth Transformers film being released (not to mention the string of bad critic reviews accompanying it), I had to check it out immediately on its first run to see if it would turn out as quite the contrary. Upon leaving the theater, one side of me had my adrenaline pumped and willing to see more, while the other felt it could've been explored much further if they improved on the human characters' chemistry toward each other as well as having a plot that wasn't sugarcoated with frenetic action sequences.Four years have passed since Sam Witwicky, Optimus Prime, and his Autobot brethren thwarted the Chicago invasion. However, government officials lead by a tyrant deduces that alien robots (whether good or bad) pose as a threat to human life, so eradication is their safe bet on ending it. Mechanic Cade Yeager, his daughter Tessa, and her boyfriend Shane must join forces alongside the surviving Autobots and counter this irrational decision at the same time dealing with a foe that Optimus himself once knew.The new human cast that features Mark Wahlberg as new human lead Cade (in place of Shia LaBeouf's Sam Witwicky) seems to prove that despite being new in the Transformers universe, it looks as though he can actually take a stand where Shia's Sam once stood. The Dinobots – marking their debut in this fourth entry – have allied with the Autobots, which was something I did not expect at the beginning of their first big-screen appearance, but it sure was a surprise that they too seem to follow the same goal as their fellow alien robots: rebellion. A small subplot involving the Dinobots' back story could've made their appearance more understandable, rather than just revealing themselves without a proper explanation. Female lead Nicola Peltz as Tessa felt irritating when it came to her constant whining and eventual becoming of the ""damsel in distress,"" which nowhere measures up to Megan Fox's strong character Mikaela. Stanley Tucci's character Joshua Joyce slowly began to remind me of John Turturro's Agent Simmons with his ""arrogant, yet conscientious"" persona, but his delivery – in the best sense - really stood out just the same as Turturro did.I got to admit I was a little disappointed not seeing Sam Witwicky return in this new conflict, but I understood that it would probably make this movie feel more like a silly charade done many times over with him (personally, I felt Sam could've at least made a cameo to explain his whereabouts or even have him give some advice to these new human characters). It was a sequel that could very well be an impressive installment in the franchise that critically tops 'Revenge of the Fallen,' falls slightly short on the first film, but looks to be on par as 'Dark of the Moon.' Like its predecessors, its frenetic and dramatic action sequences, great filming locations, a few humorous moments, complete with stunning, appealing CGI characters, impressive voice work done once again by veteran Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime, and topping it with director Michael Bay's signature explosions; he has opened the doorway to yet another possible follow-up.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
189,afsalthodupuzha,The Quintessential Transformers Flick!,7,26 June 2014,"Transformers::Age Of Extinction delivers everything that one will immediately associate with the Transformers Series or a Michael Bay movie-lavish production values,high-octane stunts,gigantic explosions,spectacular cinematography & of course numerous alien species.The fourth installment is undoubtedly better than the second & third ones in the series & introduces some interesting characters such as Dinobots,Lockdown & Galvatron in addition to the ever-lovable Optimus Prime & his autobot-gang.Here Mark Walhberg takes the driving seat from Shia LaBeouf & does an impressive job pulling out his character with perfection.The movie has a darker tone compared with the previous ones & provides more emotional quotient to the autobots.At 165 minutes,it certainly looks a bit over-stretched & borrowing the formula from previous flicks.The screenplay looks inconsistent & many scenes should have been cut-short or avoided to increase the pace of the movie.Good production values ensure that the extent of destruction going on is brought with breathtaking detail& in this regard the movie classifies as the best in the series.Overall,Age Of Extinction is tailor-made for the fans of the franchise & an average outing for the normal audience.Verdict::Right from the word go,Transformers::Age Of Extinction looks made-to measure for the fans of the popular Transformers franchise.All the movies in the series had its fair share of flaws and this one too is far from called perfect,but offers enough excitement & thrills to qualify as a decent recommendation.Not a must watch,but worth a try!!

What's cooler than Transformers and explosions? Transformers riding DINO Transformers and explosions!!! Get ready for tedious slow-mo effects, an actor who switches his Irish accent on and off, corny and over-dramatic dialogue, IN-YOUR-FACE product placement (YOU SHOULD BUY THE PILL BY BEATS, AND LOOK AT THE NEW CAMERO! DON'T FORGET TO DRINK YOUR OVALTINE), your typical hot girl and hot guy personalities AND relationship, the carefully placed single-allotted F word, and plenty of other little things to annoy the heck out of you!However, it is still an entertaining film, and it is a sci-fi action film, a 4th Transformers movie from Micheal Bay, so the expectancy of realism is already thrown out the window, and taken with a grain of salt the film isn't terrible, but it's not very good either. I mean yes it's an action film, but no way can those humans be more indestructible than any of those transformers. Which they are apparently.Really, it's not as bad as the second Transformers movie, but it's far worse than the others. It's everything you would expect from Micheal Bay, so if you love cool action scenes with barrages of explosions and more slow-mo, and even more Micheal Bayness, you'll find it worth seeing in the theaters.

192,StonedMagician,Above Average: 6.0,6,29 July 2019,"The second and third Transformers films were awful. There's no getting around it. Lacking any self-awareness, and full of cringe-worthy scenes, both Revenge of the Fallen and Dark of the Moon rank among the worst films ever made. So imagine my surprise when I was watching Age of Extinction, and was actually enjoying myself. It's not a great movie, of course (and it's arguably not even good). But compared to the last two films in the franchise, it's practically a masterpiece. But that's not to say that it's very dissimilar its predecessors. The human characters are still less human than the robots, the dialogue is dubious (though the ratio of action to dialogue is considerably higher this time), and it can get visually confusing to decipher what's happening onscreen. But these are flaws that the other three movies had as well, and Age of Extinction easily tops all but the first one in terms of pure quality. I had fun, and that's more than I can say for my experience with Michael Bay's last six years.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Marvel films are so horribly overrated that there are currently three movies on IMDb's top 250 list, While Transformers: Age of Extinction isn't anything great I wish people would stop hating on it while they continue to obsess over Marvel crap.But would I recommend this movie? Only if you enjoy Marvel as well.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
194,YJLcool,"Not a great film by any means, but still a decent blockbuster entertainment",7,27 June 2014,"The Transformers film franchise, which started in 2007, was always highly criticized for its chaotic, messy plot, over-the-top bad acting, the tasteless, offensive and crude humour, cheesy and cliché ridden dialogues, features blatant product placement for many companies and overly long screen time for every instalment. But, why people are still flocking to cinemas to watch them? It is simply because Michael Bay always managed to leave the audience wowed each time with realistic and life-like CGI robots, big action sequences with explosions, beautiful scenery, stylish luxury sports cars and sexy hot stars.The film takes place 5 years after the events of Dark of the Moon, start fresh by telling a new story with the Yaegers replacing the Witwickys, which got caught up in the battle between man and machine when Cade bought a rundown trailer truck, unaware that it's actually Optimus Prime himself. This puts him and his family right in the path of ruthless corrupted CIA agents, who seeks to destroy all Transformers and eliminate anyone who's involved with them. Many of the Autobots or Decepticons who remained on Earth are either hunted down and killed or forced into hiding.The film takes a serious approach, darker tone compared with the previous trilogy. The story centers around the Yeagers' father-daughter relationship, which is slightly refreshing and better compared with the unrealistic relationships between Witwicky and his two exceptionally hot girlfriends. For this film, Michael Bay finally managed to clear up the film's visuals with better action choreography. The slow-motion action sequences actually help the audience to follow what is happening on screen and who's fighting who. This makes the action sequences more enjoyable for a wider audience. Not to mention, Bay also reduces and removes many of the stupid, offensive, racist jokes that the previous trilogy had.Another noticeable improvement which never been done in the previous films: developing distinctive personalities for the robot characters by giving them more screen time to interact with each other. This time, Bumblebee shares his screen time with the newly-introduced Autobots (Hound, Drift and Crosshairs) for the audience to really get to know them, instead of big hunks of metal clanging against each other. The film has lesser military combats and focusing more on the robot action. There are more interesting character dynamics between them than before, especially Optimus. Optimus is more compelling than previous films, showing his anger and disappointment towards the humans for their betrayal. He is losing faith in humanity and questions his ideals.As usual, the visual effects by ILM are absolutely stunning and groundbreaking. The CGI effects actually manage to bring these non- existent mechanical beings to life. The details of the Autobot transformation remains impressive and convincingly realistic. The film still managed to put me in awe at how lifelike these robots are on screen, despite the fact that it's 7 years after the first Transformers film. It is truly a sight to behold when Optimus rides the fire- breathing Grimlock to war after he swiftly convinces the Dinobot leader to assist his cause. Once again, ILM has proved that they are the best in the visual effects industry.Mark Wahlberg has proved himself that he's a better actor and a better lead than Shia LaBeouf. Mark actually involves himself in the action sequences, never overacts, runs and screams ""Optimus!!"" or ""Bee!!"" like Shia in the previous trilogy. Stanley Tucci is also better as the tech corp KSI founder Joshua Joyce compared with the annoying stupid Agent Simmons (John Turturro) or Leo Spitz (Ramón Rodríguez) in past films. Kelsey Grammar is perfectly cast as the villainous CIA black-ops head, Attinger as well. Unfortunately, Nicola Peltz's character as Cade's daughter and Jack Reynor's character as her boyfriend falls flat though, with Reynor giving the worst performance among the cast.Despite the numerous improvements, the film still suffers from numerous plot logic issues, unnecessary cheesy dialogues and scenes, overdone jokes that failed miserably and lots of annoying blatant product placement advertisements to reduce the film's budget. The film also feels overly long with its 157 minutes of running time (excluding film credits). Dinobots are the main attraction for this film, but sadly there's not a lot of screen time for them at all. It would be interesting to see more of them in robot mode, speaking and interact with other characters in the film. The film also ends abruptly with many questions left unanswered in the end, which opens for another sequel again.Overall, this is not a great film by any means, so do not expect deep, meaningful story lines which this film does not have. However, this one actually have its heart at the right place this time compared with the previous two sequels. Age of Extinction is the film that Transformers should have been a long time ago. In my opinion, it's the best Transformers film so far. A blockbuster entertainment.Rating:7/10(To note, I always have a love/hate relationship with the Transformers film series. I hate them because of the messy, flawed story, over-the- top bad acting, distasteful, stupid, offensive and crude jokes, cheesy and cliché ridden dialogues, lack of character development for the robots. Because of these issues, I cannot give them a high rating. But, I also love them because of the realistic, lifelike CGI robot designs and some of the awesome action sequences. These are my guilty pleasure films.)For comparisons, here are my ratings for the previous films: First Transformers: 6/10 Revenge of the Fallen: 4.5/10 Dark of the Moon: 6.5/10http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2014/06/",Transformers - Age of Extinction
195,theemuhammede,Let's lock it down,8,22 April 2016,"This Transformers movie was pretty good besides three things. The human element, the transformation, and Megatron's and Optimus Prime's new looks.There was too much of the human element in the movie. It seems that the story is revolved around the human characters instead of the Transformer characters.It needs more Transformers, and less humans.The new creative and innovative way that the rebuilt Decepticons transform is cool but annoying. By having them transform in that of small particle like shapes, it took away from that original Transformers transformation in the form of gears.Megatron's new look is absolutely horrible. The giant hole in his chest looks so stupid. His body also looks shorter but fatter. But then Optimus Prime is quite the opposite. Optimus Prime looks like he is much taller and more fit; his body now seems more like a human body. It is cool but weird.Lockdown is by far the coolest,, baddest, and best Transformers villain thus far. He blows Megatron out of the water by a long shot.

196,SpoodermanDerp,"Autobots, Find A Plot.",4,28 June 2014,"Before I entered the theater, I had high expectations for this film, my friend had told me it was a great blockbuster and on-par with the first one. I was wrong for believing him. Transformers 4 is, again, just another Michael Bay movie with everything Michael Bay still. But this time, longer and unimaginably dull with its long run time. It is forgettable and a money-grabber. There is no doubt Bay will make another Transformers movie, and make tons of money. What annoyed me very much is that this movie had no plot essence into it. The Plot is just downright NOTHING. In each scene they struggle to find a plot to make it into a movie, but instead, they give us forgettable action sequences, annoying characters, the same annoying Bay humor and characters they try to make us care for, but of course, it does not work. Performances of Mark Wahlberg and Stanley Tucci are the standouts of this film, Nicola Peltz (as I expected) was horrible in this film, she was completely annoying. Then, there are the auto-bots which I did not care about, and were just there, for Toys and Marketing, adding the Dinobots was just completely useless and just to lure in fans to watch this non-sensible movie, I did not care about the auto-bots, since this movie is STILL focusing MORE on human story, they fail on trying to give the auto-bots life and ""soul"". The antagonists, however, in this film, are far worst, They are the same freaking Bay villains, in Bay MOVIES!, Galavatron is worthless, Lockdown was wasted and horrible. The Action Seqences in this movie, were horrid as well, if you've seen the action sequences in Transformers 1-3, thats what you'll see in this 4th installment, except there are Dinobots in this one, every time an action sequence starts, I do not feel excited or pumped in any way, they were confusing, and the people beside me in the theater were quite confused as well, the cinematography in the film makes it hard to watch the scenes, the questions that pops up in my head whenever a battle is in commence is: ""WHO'S FIGHTING WHO?! ""WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING???"". By the end of the movie, I remembered, this movie is made for TOYS. You should not go in this movie and expect it to be as great as other blockbuster films out there. If somebody will ask me if they should watch this film, I would say: if you like dull action scenes, the same Michael Bay method in his films over and over again, then go watch it, I will not stop you, this is just me stating my opinion on the film.Verdict: 4.7/10",Transformers - Age of Extinction
197,moviescoundrel,A Long Cheesy Mess,6,29 June 2014,"Great Scott this is a long movie! It would appear that Michael Bay is trying to give Jim Cameron a run for his money in the lengthy, special effects filled film category. However, Cameron's films are typically a bit better than Bay's. I appreciate Bay's style for the most part, but have not loved his recent choices. I did not love ""Pain and Gain"" or most of the ""Transformers"" movies. Out of the four ""Transformers"" movies I liked ""Dark of the Moon"" the most. It also was lengthy like all of the other ones, but with some amazing 3D scenes that took place in Chicago, some darkness, and less cheesiness, it felt different. This film felt a bit different two, but it was hard for it to stand out with the approximate three hour run time. The film started out fine and established a few of the leads, Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) the inventor father, Nicola, Cade's high school daughter, and T.J., Cade's obnoxious employee. When Cade repairs an old Autobot the government intervenes immediately and all sorts of bad things start to happen. Aliens have invaded earth and have an alliance with the government and wants to destroy all the Autobots, the government wants to destroy all the Autobots and have distorted the truth given to the pubic so the public will blindly support this cause, and a robotics/technology firm KSI has some new technology made with some old Decepticon ingenuity. These are all bad things, and when added together equal three hours of problems! I really do appreciate some of Bay's montages. I like the scenes involving humans the most. When the motivational background music comes on and the humans show emotional angst, it works for me. It doesn't quite happen enough however, probably four times for a minute or so throughout the movie. There is too much mindless, meaningless robotic filler with characters you don't care about or dialogue that does not make sense. I typically appreciate longer films and feel rewarded, here I wish I could take this to the editing room and take out an hour of this movie, along with a couple of transformers and subplots. A bit underwhelming, but not a complete disaster. C'mon Bay, get that ""Bad Boys 3"" story going!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
198,georgecoffeynewyorker,"Confusing plot, BUT Comical great action",7,12 July 2014,"When I saw the movie initially ie for the first time, one word came out with me. CONFUSION. There was the Decepticons, AutoBots and Humans. Then there was Grammers character and Tucci. It was just bloody frustrating. I did however go back again and again to the movie. Today being my 3rd time seeing it. I do feel that you MUST see the previous Transformers films. Now I have seen the previous film with Shia LeBouf. However, I DON'T remember it too well, hence why I was sooooo lost in this particular film. So I was left with guessing who is with who etc., etc., So after the 3rd time seeing it. I began to connect the dots. From what I can gather and understand, the Deceptioncs were with Humans in fighting the AutoBots which is kinda Ironic as the AutoBots are like the Deceoptuitcons. But as it happens, Decipteicons and AutoBots were all along against each other and hence the previous films portrayed that the AutoBots, took to the AutoBots or as Optimus Prime says: ""I am forever in your debt"". The film starts of with the ""Apocalyptic"" event that occurred millions of years ago when the dinosaurs were aniolated. When the event occurs, the spaceships beam down and aniolate the dinosaurs making the dinosaurs into ""Transformium"" as we later learn. Then to present day, Cade(Wahlberg) who is a dead beat dad to a daughter - Tessa(PEltz) and who later learn Cade has to contend with SEXY Shane(Reynor). Cade in the meantime, comes home with a disused truck whom we later learn: ""I think we've just found a transformer""(Cade). The disused truck is actually Optimus Prime(voiced by Cullen). The CIA gets hold of this missing truck from Lucas(Miller). He didn't think they ""would be alien killers"". Despite Lucas being told that the Govt don't offer money for the Alien activity he still went ahead and contacted them and reported the Truck being a Transformer. So Cade objects ""Hey u don't have a warrant"". CIA Director, James(Welliever) replies cleverly ""My face is my warrant"". So while fighting ensues between Humans and Decepticons and Cade while trying to save his daughter, he encounters all the ""alien gun"". etc., He says as he's an inventor ""Oh, man. I'm so gonna patent this sh.t"". There was no short of comedy no question of it. The company KSI that is involved in this debacle of the Transformium have a lovely quote. ""Past is HistoryPresent is PastFuture is NOW""While Harold (Grammer) meets up with Lockdown - Decepticon(Ryan), Harold states: ""We have a saying on earth, the enemy of my enemy is my friend"". Joshua tells his work colleagues when flaws are found in his Galvatron, later known as Megatron(providing the new Lockdown)that ""A flaw is a total failure"". Brains(Wilson) explains to Cade, his daughter Tessa and the boyfriend that ""No unions, no benefits"" when transferring brain power while complaining of course. One of Joshua(Tucci) comic aspects of the film, when they are all racing against time, they encounter elderly Chinese women and Joshua exclaims: ""How the ""F*** do you say ""get out of the way"", in Chinese"". Another one: ""Really, hide in a glass house""(Tucci) And when the spaceship that crashes onto a car a dumbass of the driver wants Insurance. Cade replies ""Good luck finding Insurance on a Space ship. He continued saying to his daughter ""Sweetie, get my alien gun"". While conversing with Optimus Prime, Cade says ""Teenager,"" and Optimus replies "" I went through the same thing with Bumblebee.""So overall GREAT movies. But even after the third time watching it, STILL can't get the plot. It'll take a few more runs to the Movie Theater.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Let me also admit that the first movie for me was a guilty pleasure for me, then the second movie really messed up badly with the annoying quirky humor that nobody even likes and then came the third that was already criticized for it's awful humor of course but also it's amount of illogical action and physics.I'm still wondering why Michael Bay still get's to make the sequels I mean his directions are so incredibly cheesy and not to mention that he also cheats with certain scenes from his previous movies and modifies them to become into something new. Could they hire some new writers please? I don't even know if Ehren Kruger even gives a crud about the Transformers anymore because the story in this movie was just lame and incoherent. The story just feels like he has been rehashing materials from the other three movies and combining them into something like a big crossover of stories with very little time for explanations only because we already know what it's all about.For me it just felt the same experience like the other three movies, there was absolutely nothing new except for the human characters. But I mean the movie was just going like a big concept of how to make a brainless action movie with awful humor and uninteresting characters. Could they please stop delivering these quirky humor, Michael Bay promised for the second time to us that he wouldn't deliver goofy humor but yet I can still see them walking around almost every 5 minutes, no seriously.The acting was pretty irritating, I thought some of the characters just acted like other characters that we have already seen in other movies. And again nothing new this movie didn't try to be something new it was almost like watching a movie that just had to be made for the sake of the stories with Transformers.I hope that someday we get a reboot were the Transformers movies works better with respect and without trying to rehash materials or even use annoying quirky humor.Is it recommended? T:AOE was a total mess. Despite the great special effects and the sound experience it still wasn't worth it. I'm not afraid of saying this but if this movie gets nominated or perhaps even win the Razzies for worst picture I wont get mad at all but I just hope that some people will learn it's biggest flaws. I don't even think I can surpass the next sequels, Michael Bay has already promised us so many things that I can't trust him anymore.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
200,JamesIan2021,"Favourite Movie, Just Non-Stop Excitement, Comedy and Action!",9,24 March 2015,"People love to hate Michael Bay, everything about him they rip from his use of explosions, lens flares, lengthy action, apparent ""porno"" shots and bad humour. Over his lengthy career he's created giant action flicks from The Rock, Pearl Harbor, Bad Boys to The Island, all of which are so distinctive in style you know it's a Bay flick immediately. This man isn't changing his ways. People see his films, they make a ton of money. The first Transformers opening to mixed reviews yet it raked in just under $500,000,000. The second film was critically panned, yet that took in short of $900,000,000, and by this time people really hated Bay after this film. Then came Dark Of The Moon, the third film that took in a whopping $1.1 billion, sounds crazy right? You can see where I'm going.Age Of Extinction is the biggest box office film in 2014. This fourth instalment is the longest and has been the worst reviewed; yet the box office numbers are outstanding. Michael Bay you are a legend! Transformers Age Of Extinction is perfection in blockbusting entertainment, simply put it's 165 minutes of awesome. In Age Of Extinction, the Transformers are being hunted after the destruction of Chicago, and now humans have developed Transformers of their own using ""Transformium"" in order to take them down, as well as making a deal with Lockdown, a bounty hunter who will stop at nothing to get the job done. When struggling inventor Cade Yeager unknowingly stumbles upon Optimus Prime in hiding, Yeager, his daughter Tessa and her boyfriend Shane become fugitives when they decide to harbour Optimus, setting off a string of events that could lead up to our extinction. New characters, new threats, a darker tone and an even bigger scope, I never thought Bay could top Dark Of The Moon. It's great seeing humans taking sides with evil robotic forces, there's a sense of uncertainty surrounding trust, any sides could turn on one another, and watching the humans control an unstable metal of which the Transformers are made of sets up some exciting scenes. I was ecstatic that the story took us back to Chicago five years after the attack, seeing the city back to normal was cool, and also a set-up for more chaos to reign down on the city. I particularly enjoyed all the scenes revolving around Cade and Tessa Yeager, it's a highly believable Father Daughter relationship, and throwing a boyfriend into the mix for Tessa ignites some fun tension and conflict. Mark Wahlberg once again proves himself to be a top action movie star, he has a ton of energy as Cade, dashing around the screen and taking a stand in action scenes as he gets hold of a alien weapon. Wahlberg handles emotion and intensity superbly and shows his comedy chops throughout, some of his one liners are awesome ""Sweetie, hand me my alien gun!"" Nicola Peltz is excellent, you can tell she's having real fun playing Tessa Yeager. As well as Wahlberg her ability to make you laugh and feel terror leaves an impression. Jack Reynor is awesome, bringing Irish charm as racer Shane and Tessa's secret boyfriend. Reynor speeds into the movie about forty minutes in and he already boasts presence. Stanley Tucci is outstanding, playful and suitably menacing, and his ""Oh my God!"" scream is the best I've heard in a movie, and Kelsey Grammar is marvellous as the evil opposition for the protagonists, plus Titus Welliver is a kick-ass operative, he's a severely underrated actor of huge talent. T.J. Miller, Li BingBing and Sophia Myles are superb welcome additions to the cast, bringing wit, style and big laughs to this massive international cast. Michael Bay's direction is truly stupendous, his camera-work is getting better and better with more prolonged shots that allow you to take in the sprawling landscape. His slow motion continues to amaze to the point of complete and utter awe, and he gives his characters such dominating authority with the use of his low angles. He handles the comedy so much smoother this time; the laughs are consistent and well fitted even amongst chaotic action. Also no one does explosions better than Bay. He ensures you get your money's worth. Industrial Light & Magic have yet again outdone themselves, the magic that goes on in this film pays off tremendously. Words cannot describe the might, enormity and power of the action sequences that take place here. I need to emphasise how eerie and blood pumping it is to hear the build up of Imagine Dragons Battle Cry work its way into the early action scenes before unfolding the full song in the final fight between Optimus and Lockdown. The assault on Cade's farmhouse in Texas was explosive, followed by the car chase that ends with one of the best explosions in movie history where Shane, Tessa and Cade run as Lockdown's bomb detonates all in beautiful slow motion. It doesn't end there, followed by highway chases, a standoff on Lockdown's ship and a high-rise scene where heights have never been scarier. Leap to China and there's even more action.The Dino-bots roll in, how can someone not enjoy watching Optimus Prime leap onto Grimlock taking charge with a sword riding into battle alongside three other Dino- bots? I don't think I've ever been this enthralled by action, and the 3D is the best, the depth is monumental and when Bumblebee takes flight in Chicago the effect it has on you is crazy.Transformers Age Of Extinction has to be seen on the big screen in 3D, it is a whopping experience, and it's the fresh revamp I was expecting taking a new direction and totally knocking my expectations out the water.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
201,sujanfaster,How to train your Transformer.,9,30 June 2014,"You will understand the title of the review that I have given here only when you watch the movie. So, no spoilers.I have said it before and said it again. Michael Bay is not critics' favorite also not the favorite of intelligent audience. Even though I belong to the latter, sometime I just want to watch and have fun. These days when you have to pay a lot to watch a movie, you want it to be worth. And Michael Bay makes it worth every penny.Transformers Age of Extinction though a sequel has pretty much less or no connection to previous movies. With a completely new cast the director probably wants us to forget pretty much the old movies, except for the Transformer part of course. The story begins with humans wiping out all the transformers on earth with the help of some other alien transformers who have come for Optimus Prime. After something called 'Battle of Chicago', ex CIA agent Atinger is hunting them down for the ""better of the world"" and saving ""American Lives"". Yes, there are so many regular Cliché's in the movie, but it's all worth it. Optimus Prime is found in the wreckage by Cade Yeager(Wahlberg), an enthusiastic scientist/mechanic and a hands on dad for his teenage short skirt(Michael Bay's trademark) wearing daughter with an American flag hanging at the door of his Texas farmhouse (another Cliché). He finds out that it is a transformer and helps Optimus Prime get on its feet. The government (Atinger) finds out about this and the adrenaline ride begins. Wahlberg is joined by his daughter's boyfriend who helps them escape from the government attack. After they escape, Optimus Prime unites all the Autobots in style. The story takes another turn when a company headed by Joshua (Tucci) is using the dead transformers for research and developing enhanced transformers as weapons. It's all about how Optimus Prime and Yeager team up to do what the good guys do.The movie has all the elements of a Michael Bay movie, larger than life visual effects, cheap humor- which are funny of course, some powerful dialogues for Optimus Prime which makes you jump up and clap. Most of the people might think the story line is weak but I found it quite intimidating to make me sit through 160 minutes of this long movie. There are some jaw dropping slow motion sequences and the part where they show Beijing is just incredible! Also the background score and Imagine Dragons track 'Battle Cry' soundtrack amp up the experience. As always, Optimus Prime's voice is the reason that makes us satisfied and I salute Peter Cullen for that. We don't get to see much of a Bumble Bee this time, but still has its cool moments. Don't expect to go and see Wahlberg's tough guy appearance rather it's his coming timing has been carried brilliantly from Ted and 2 Guns to this movie. Nicola Peltz is hot and you don't want to expect more from her. Jack Reynor does a typical teen-boyfriend role which is not so bad after all. I was surprised to see Stanley Tucci used as a comedian in this movie. Titus Welliver and Kelsey Grammar don their government faces pretty well.I already see this movie has got bad reviews (which is not a surprise). But it's a thorough entertainer. More so, if you watch it with a large group of audience with all the cheers, whistles and claps. My name is Optimus Prime",Transformers - Age of Extinction
202,randomStuff101,Best Transformers yet,7,8 February 2015,"I have slammed all previous Transformers movies, and I have slammed Michael Bay on numerous occasions. But he's had help with this one it seems, or maybe he's learned from previous mistakes. This movie is long, but spectacular, not too cheesy compared with the previous movies.They really went guns blazing on the art direction and scale of battles and giant enemies and future tech. Great stuff, a visual feast.I watched it over two nights, which I recommend doing. Otherwise fatigue will set in, and you'll be waiting for the end rather than enjoying the ride.Finally, the camera and editing has taken a chill-pill and we can actually see the action in detail. Shots are mostly steady, editing is smooth and flowing. This is exactly what bothered me about the previous movies.Nobody is particularly annoying, the characters play their roles well and the jokes are not too pretentious.Easily the best yet in the series. It's still very much the same Michael Bay style, but it's more mature and confident.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
203,Cinema_Love,"Forget the haters, this film is great for Transformers fans.",9,2 July 2014,"I will start my review with a true bash at thoses who said this movie is junk, crap or whatever the word you like it is not, if you are a fan of the Transformers. Put aside it's from Michael Bay, it's a Transformers film, the one we were waiting for, for a long long time. It shows Transformers more than half of the movie, which is an improvement over the past three movies. Don't get me wrong, i'm a huge fan of this series. OK, the 2nd wasn't really what we hoped for. It was still watchable even if it's the worst in the series.Transformers 4 aka Transformers : Age of Extinction aka Tr4nsformers is to me, the best of the franchise as of yet. It runs at 2 hours 46 solid minutes with Mark Wahlberg outshining Shia Labeouf is all of the past 3 Transformers he stars. Shia Labeouf was my only problem with the films. And now, he's gone. Not that he's a bad actor, not at all, but he was not good in this kind of big blockbuster films. With a veteran like Marky Mark, the good vibrations were there. The superstar from past films like ''Fear'', ''Three Kings'' or ''Shooter'' put on a very strong performance here. His co-stars are great too, Stanley Tucci, always a good laugh with this pure actor and Kelsey Grammar as the main bad guy is quite enjoyable too.But the real cast is the Transformers. They upgrade in some ways, and in some ways, they are like the old school ones. Optimus Prime is back and more stronger than ever but his enemies, oh my god, they give him a harsh time. Bumble Bee is also back as the semi-leader. In my opinion, the best that this series could do one day is to give him the full lead for one movie. But Prime, is Prime and no one can stop him.I don't want to spoil anything, but if you like the past movies, you are easy audience. If you don't please don't listen to critics. I'm a kid of the 80s and this movie really represent the 5 years old kid that i was when i start liking this great franchise. Give it a try !!! 9/10",Transformers - Age of Extinction
204,eklavya-cwk,Extremely Horrible plot and senseless acting but the messed-up visual effects are must watch,6,4 July 2014,"Just spend my 165 minutes on this movie. Transformers age of extinction is an extreme level of stupid made-up plot. The whole movie is a saga of foolishness except one thing, visuals.Lengthy plot, senseless characters and their clothing, stupid script, useless acting (though I wonder if it is the mistake of plot that nothing remained for acting), scattered and non-sequential foolish plot (like Chinese people are just unaware of the huge spaceship bombing right across a mile), non-sense old rotten fake dialogues and really really worst editing. I wonder if the director and the whole team deliberately kept the movie so stupid to stress on effects or they just thought it won't be bad if they can show family love so unsuccessfully.But what cheers a guy are its visuals effects with 3d at its best. These visual effects are super fun, totally messed up, non-sequential, a lot in amount and totally enjoyable without logic. The whole stress is given to the effects and the machines, transformers, the whole stupidity was tolerable for me due to those effects.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
205,Tyson14,Age of exhaustion,4,15 August 2014,"Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014) is one for the shower. It is an endless two hours and forty minutes, made strictly for an illiterate, masochistic audience who seek out movies that will bang them over the head and deafen them. The rest of us may feel so wiped out that we will need to run home, take two Bayer aspirin, and wash off the residue of director Michael Bey's masturbatory excesses. Bey has made enough money pleasuring himself to toys that he could put a serious dent in the national deficit. That says a lot about contemporary movie executives and perhaps even more about the typical moviegoer.That aptly named Age of Extinction could very well be a prophetic symbol for movies as a meaningful form of entertainment. To say Transformers is soulless is too much of a given. I cannot imagine anyone even talking about the movie afterwards, except perhaps out of sheer embarrassment for having dragged oneself in to see it. I am unsure how many of these movies have been made, and have no desire to find out after having seen this one; but the fact that a series of Transformers movies have been produced already almost guarantees it making a gazillion dollars off numbed contemporary audiences forever looking for sensation devoid of feeling.Based on the Hasbro robot toy line, Transformers is too pornographic in its violence to be seen by children, and any parent taking their kids to see it should have their head examined. The actors, who include Mark Wahlberg, Kelsey Grammar, and John Goodman, are in the nadir of their careers. They are lost among scraping metal, explosions, and countless product placements, which at least provides minuscule relief from all the ""noise, noise, noise."" Unfortunately, like Boris Karloff's Grinch, we are rendered powerless in our attempt to shut it all up because the noise is the only thing that prevents us from succumbing to complete boredom. Death from boredom would be far preferable, however, and leave less wear on the posterior. Robots are supposed to be cool, and despite having robots who can turn into cars, Transformers can't inspire any emotion besides lethargy. I kept asking myself how Bay could manage to make robots dull, until I remembered that Clint Eastwood worked hard, and successfully, at sucking all the fun and poetry out of the Western and transforming it into a hopelessly vacuous genre.Not helping the robots is shockingly asinine dialogue delivered by Goodman (in voice over), Wahlberg as a mad scientist type, and Grammar as the stock CIA exec. Incredibly, the girls in the movie are even more witless, reduced to cardboard whores for Bay's fetishistic lens.Transformers is not so much a movie as a heavily advertised media event. Doubtless, the besotted businessmen funding this clanging, metallic peepshow fancy their product as imaginative enough to rake in plenty of dyed green paper from its zombified audience. To be certain, the producers will be quite busy tallying their profits, but all that green is rendered an illusionless illusion because, although good movies are still being made, American Cinema is broke, and all the king's horses and all the king's men will not be able to put it together again.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
206,Brettyboy007,Michael Bay's next Transformers,9,6 July 2014,"Here it is: The next Transformers from director Michael Bay. There are many different points in this movie and I will try to address them all. I personally give this a 9/10 and I will tell everyone why I do.My friend and his brother and I went to this movie in IMAX 3D. WE LOVED IT! My friend thought it was the best Transformers yet. Seeing it in IMAX 3D is the best form of this movie you should watch. It just looks fantastic. Yes, the ratio changed frequently throughout but it's nothing to gripe about. I grew up watching the animated series but it was so long ago that watching the Transformers movies from the start was sort of a new start for me.For the plot: I honestly agree with a lot of the reviews here about the plot not well developed and it jumping all over the place. But I do think that that was not what Bay wants to best for these movies. Bay focuses more on the Transformers hence the title.Special effects and the Transformers themselves were great! This is Bay's strong point because he and the rest of the crew work the most on the design of them and how they battle. We also get introduced to the Dinobots for the first time in the series. I've read some of the other reviews on here saying they lasted 10 minutes. Uh..they lasted at least 30-45 minutes. Although, a low point I would have to say is the new Transformers. I didn't like the way they transformed. I like the original Transformers in the first trilogy more than the new ones.Locations: The places they filmed were very well done. It ranged from Chicago to Hong Kong. The next Transformers movie they film in Chicago I'm going to try to be an extra in it.Characters: Since this is a fresh start for Transformers, we get a new batch of characters. Mark Wahlberg as Cade Yeager replaces Shia Labeouf as the main lead. Nicola Peltz as Tessa Yeager is the new girl and Jack Reynor plays her boyfriend Shane. We also get introduced to a couple new villains with Kelsey Grammar playing Harold Attinger who is a CIA agent on a mission to exterminate the remaining Transformers. Stanley Tucci plays Joshua Joyce who wants to build his own Transformers. We get a couple background characters but these are the main leads. For the new Transformers, we get introduced to Hound, Drift, and Crosshairs. They are part of the Autobots helping Optimus Prime. A new Transformers villain we get is the bounty hunter Lockdown.Now for character development: I agree that there wasn't much of it during the movie. Some people liked Shia more than Mark and some liked Mark more than Shia. I think Mark still has to prove himself, because he was just in this one as Shia was in three. Nicola of course is mainly used for eye candy and she gets it. She is a very beautiful actress. I didn't understand why Jack changed his accent a lot.Overall Transformers: Age of Extinction is very well done with the special effects and the introduction to the Dinobots. I would recommend that everyone who had seen the other Transformers to see this and don't listen to the reviews. I think Bay is definitely heading toward something new with this trilogy and will just raise the bar with the next two movies.And remember: It's a Michael Bay movie.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
207,OlieRendch,I think I may be watching this franchise just out of habit now.,5,10 July 2014,"So after the first three Transformer films we were told that was it, end of a trilogy but nope, here is yet another Transformers. Now I really didn't like the last one, Dark of the Moon I thought was just a bad movie in general and didn't really want to see any more, but then like many others I hear of the cast change and I like Mark Wahlberg so I decided to give this a try. First off, this movie goes to some very different places than what we've seen, not only does it feel different because of the cast but the concepts and ideas that they touch on or imply change this franchise drastically; although I still think the first movie is the best out of them all this movie has elements that seem to be headed on the right track, there aren't really any generic giant robots that are used as cannon fodder, this movie, like the first, gives you defined recognisable characters, both heroes and villains. The new Autobots had their own personalities and the main villain had an interesting character; then there's the humans, Wahlberg was great in his role and his family were an enjoyable group to watch, Stanley Tucci was awesome and even Kelsey Grammar was a good government baddie. The comedy has improved too, like the first movie I genuinely laughed at some of the jokes, I mean you still get some Michael Bay unrealistic humour which is a bit awkward but what do you expect. Now that brings me to some negative points, it is after all a Michael Bay Transformers movie, the explosions are over-the-top I mean to the point where you think every battle is the climax, way to much. And then there's that thing that the third movie started doing and that was giving the robots saliva and blood. I mean so it's supposed to be oil or alien liquid but what robots vomit or spit? It's a problem I find annoying anyway. By the way there are two plots in this film, the main one about this alien bounty hunter/pirate, I didn't mind, the second one about some secret science project I wasn't a fan of, it seemed a bit unnecessary and then they did a twist near the end which I was not a fan of so yeah, Transformers: Age of Extinction is still very much like the others and even 20 minutes of Dinobots didn't help; the first act was brilliant and then it started to go downhill but in the end it left open some intriguing plot points",Transformers - Age of Extinction
208,aldri-feb,A sequel that should be extinct,3,25 June 2014,"With showing some big explosions, loud score, city destructions, robots combat, slow-motion movement, brainless dialog and couple times exposed women wearing short pants, eventually makes it no significant differences between ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" and those other Transformers movies. As expected, this 4th installment of Transformers series struggle in some mess plot, it's monotone storyline and in-aware humanity issue. There are so many plot holes, non-sense and dumb moment in the movie that couldn't be tolerable. It also lost in human's character development and wastes so much talented casts this film got. The star like Mark Wahlberg and Stanley Tucci seems only being object, their character just screaming, yelling, running and shooting anywhere they feels right. Unfortunately all that horrible materials from this franchise felt unsurprised, considering Michael Bay still commands as director. He and Ehren Kruger as writer probably never learn some mistakes they had done from the previous Transformers. Their collaboration have been a messed-up since ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen"" which is strange why Paramount studio still extend their service to continue this promising and profitable film. Though the graphic visual might be showing some progress and the IMAX 3D is undeniably good, still it may not much to save these from disaster. Afterall ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" is a cheap entertainment with big budget production that truly defines what a real mess-up movie is and a franchise which hopefully to be over and extincted. My suggestion, just having zero expectation before watching this or it's gonna be a 160 minutes full of regret and disappointment.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
209,maxastree,A style is not a movie,2,24 February 2015,"This film is damned funny for the first hour or so as if the writers are adding a layer of self-conscious smirking cheese to the script for older viewers. Like Battlefield Earth, or the Room, the principal cast utter lines that suggest something inherently ironic or humorously critical of the United States in general, and film making in particular. The nominal plot focuses on evil CIA operatives and supremely wealthy corrupt businessmen trying to harness advanced alien tech for military use, a plot so cheesy you can smell it across the room. Naturally, chaos ensues with multiple car chases, buildings blasted, and images of huge over-designed robots blasting guns endlessly while particle effects, CGI buildings and digital matte paintings endlessly warp, splinter, smoulder and explode. Basically, Michael Bay has a style, but no story; the repetitive formula of shaky cam, dynamic depth shots, quick cuts and ""eye popping"" robot wide angles is repeated hundreds of times over the films extended running length. He also favours cutting too soon, à la 80s trash horror, to give the impression the film is one huge sugar rush. (there's also a LOT of slow-mo during messy action sequences, which tends to accentuate how geometric the CGI is, none of which is well designed, but is created to a high standard.) I'm writing this review on my touch screen mobile phone, which is quite appropriate because this movie is pretty SOULLESS. Unfortunately, most of the ""wow"" shots in the movie suffer from Bays obvious lack of restraint, from conception thru to final edit, however the film DOES have a sense of visual style that would make for effective ADVERTISING!!!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
210,prospectus_capricornium,Utterly Disappointing,4,26 June 2014,"For someone who hasn't really followed this franchise religiously, I really can't say much about how 'Age of Extinction' fared with the films of the first trilogy. Now, viewing it as a standalone movie, I can say that there is nothing else more exciting about it than the CGI-effects extravaganza it offers, other than that, this flick bears no difference from an endurance test.Transformers 4's biggest failure is its utterly poor writing. The actors are great but there isn't enough good material for them to work with. Mark Wahlberg's undeniable charm proves to be one of the biggest advantages of this film but even that charm is overshadowed by the movie's exceedingly horrible script. It's hard to imagine that such movie, whose entire production budget costs as much as the US gross The Amazing Spiderman 2 has been struggling to reach, can still be so deprived of sense and wit, so much that throughout that two hours and 45 minutes it's running, you'll find yourself wondering how much longer can you still endure staring at the screen while hoping something sensible other than just mere special effects will come out and save the film from being assessed as total garbage.That being said, I still put 'Age of Extinction' on top of my Transformers movie list, mainly because it has Mark Walhberg, who proves to be a lot more sensible than Shia ever was in the last three movies. Wahlberg shines best at every action-packed scene this movie has plenty of, and added with the inundation of visual effects , his scenes are undoubtedly among the biggest spectacles of this movie. Let's not forget of course, the major players of this movie: the robots. I can honestly say, if there's one thing I have for this movie that remained alive in the end as it was before I saw it, that's my amazement for Autobots and Decepticons, and for the Dinobots, too. Other than that, everything else has just drastically faded.As a sci-fi action movie, 'Age of Extinction' is fine. For someone who roots for massive action sequences, this one proves to be a lot more than you can imagine. But then again, looking at it critically, it's utterly painful to give this movie even just a star only because of the level of visual spectacle it presented, for it could have given more had the writers found a smart way to integrate the sfx extravaganza and gritting action scenes with an interesting and compelling human story.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
211,heatsink98,Don't expect much here,5,27 June 2014,"Short Version: The Autobots are hunted by a shadowy government organization affiliated with a Transformer bounty hunter, and captured bots are given over to a private company for research. KSI, the private company, is building its own Transformers for the US military as soldiers. Unbeknownst to all, Megatron is waiting to take control of the KSI bots, steal a Transformer-tech bomb, and generally cause mayhem.This film might have been more palatable if it had been trimmed by an hour. There is a plot, but it is stretched beyond a two hour running time. The bulk of the film is running gunfights, wrecked buildings/planes/trains/automobiles, and slow-mo explosions. Some of the odder scenes include gratuitous shots of Nicola Peltz' legs, along with cornball breaks for product placement that border on parody. I can't decide if the shot where Mark Wahlberg stops in a chase to crack open a Bud Light is genius comedy or not. The writing seems aimed at fourth graders, so adults might tire of the on-screen shenanigans quickly. Note that the dinobots in the film don't show up until the final battle, so their time in the story is limited. The film seems written for younger kids, but it's also sprinkled with rough language, if that's a parenting concern. The last half of the movie slid toward more juvenile scenes and goofy dialog.Verdict: Can you take over two hours of action scenes in classic Michael Bay style strung together with a thin plot? Can you also take the writing aimed at the younger crowd? This film might be for you. I started checking my watch at the hour mark.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
212,slicedbread117,The Demise of Transfomers,2,28 June 2014,"There's a term used often in the entertainment business geared towards the unnecessary creation of a new product: cash-cow. In this case, the cash-cow is Transformers: Age of Extinction, which has finally convinced me that this franchise has completely lost its focus, and turned into nothing but a money-grubbing franchise.I mine as well dive right into it, starting with an enormous downfall for this movie, and that is the man in the directors chair. It's easier to figure out what a gibberish-talking baby wants than to try and figure out Michael Bay's vision for this doomed series. The direction style of Bay once again takes almost all wind out of the movie's sails with a slew of faults, that prove as long as Mr. Bay is directing this series, it will continue to be a mess. So let's use the ""good, bad and ugly"" way of pointing things out, in reverse order. Let's begin.The ugly: I'd like to start with the plot and screenplay. What made the first Transformers movie special for me and many others was the fresh and exciting new adventure I was being taken on. The discovery of the Transformers for the first time and watching Autobots and Decepticons duke it out was simple, yet incredible. Fast forward to the fourth installment in the series, and it is anything but simple. What once was a compact story centered around just one conflict has turned into a mess of confusion surrounding the movie's main plot, along with the numerous undeveloped sub plots. There's simply too much going on, and the movie never gives you a chance to process everything that's happening. The film's pacing is as off as it's ever been. The constant hopping back and forth between sub plots and the main plot is as exhausting as it is confusing, and the painful 165 minute run time just makes these matters worse. Far too often is tension built up for a seemingly huge action moment, only to be completely let down. The humor is dull and often stereotypical, with too many forced comedic relief sections to count. Throw in the awful product placement with countless lines of useless, time-consuming dialogue and at times it doesn't even feel like you're watching a Transformers movie, hardly what the die hard fans want.The bad: The (human) cast of the film combine to deliver a less- than- admirable performance to say the least. Star actor Mark Wahlberg signs on to take the lead as Cade Yeager and uses his undeniable acting talent to breath some much needed new life into the series. However, after Wahlberg, the cupboard is empty concerning depth. Nicola Peltz, taking on the role of Cade's daughter Tessa, is nothing but another pretty face and a still young and inexperienced actress who needs much more development. Stanley Tucci's portrayal of Joshua Joyce unfortunately gets weaker as the film goes on, turning him from a powerful inventor to an annoying side show. The characters are misdeveloped and inconsistent, making them very hard to like for a long movie such as this. While the human cast fails to thrive, it's the Transformers themselves that save the movie from being a complete and total nightmare.The good: Not all hope is lost for this movie. If you're strictly in for the action, then you're in luck. The view of the fast-paced, high energy, roller coaster action we've come to expect from Michael Bay, along with gorgeous CGI is enticingly entertaining, especially because it's Transformers doing the battle. Watching the legendary Optimus Prime and fan favorite Bumblebee on screen whooping butt again is a blast to watch. It's a shame that certain characters didn't get the screen time they deserved, especially the beloved and terrifyingly awesome Dinobots. Nonetheless, the epic action and the presence of bad a** Transformers is enough to keep Age of Extinction out of the deep and dark abyss.Don't get me wrong for a second, I am all for a continuing and successful film franchise to continue to think of and create new ideas for future projects. Obviously money is a large reason for a series to continue, but it seems like the once promising Transformers franchise is now just here to make the money and move on to the next project without giving their passionate fan base what they're really expecting and hoping for, myself included.So, what's the verdict? In my personal opinion, Transformers: Age of Extinction is a giant 165 minute cluster filled with horrendous pacing, terrible story progression, unfunny humor, relentlessly unnecessary scenes of different moments, a very poor cast and the entertaining if crazy action. Michael Bay struck gold with the original Transformers back in 2007, but now the series has gone off the rails, turning into a unstable, confusing, unrecognizable cash-cow.3/10",Transformers - Age of Extinction

214,jhigginbotham151,Its total Bayhem!,7,26 July 2014,"Out of all the Transformers films (which is around 10 hours of explosions) this one is definitely the best. I just had more fun watching this than I did any of the others, its not as well written (or as well written as a Michael Bay movie can be)as the original Transformers, but its far more enjoyable than the groan inducing Revenge Of The Fallen and the put your ass to sleep Dark Of The Moon. A mechanic and his family join the Autobots as they are targeted by a bounty hunter from another world. Thats all the plot you need to know, trust me you'll make it far easier on yourself if you think about it like that. Marky Mark plays Cade Yeager who's a struggling inventor and father to the hottest girl to ever be in a Transformers movie, who's in a relationship to an Irish guy because Bay thinks he's being more multi cultural that way. OK seriously Nicola Peltz is in this movie for one reason and its not to act, its the same reason Fox and Huntington- Whiteley got cast in their roles. Jack Reynor is the same except for a female audience, even though they already have Mark Wahlberg so why they need him I don't know. Oh wait I do know, family Dynamic, Bay needs the family turmoil to parallel the fight between the giant robots and in my opinion, while I did care more this time around, mostly because Wahlberg gives Yeager a relatable, nice guy down on his luck personality, so that we do care for him and his family, but if it was between that and getting a much shorter film about the Transformers on Cybertron, I would pay for ninety minutes of Bayhem on Cybertron. The rest of the cast do their job, Grammar, Tucci and so on do what they do and thats it. The voices of the Transformers are the same and different. The always awesome Peter Cullen voices Optimus Prime and the voice still sounds awesome. I don't really care about the rest of the autobots but I will say that I loved Mark Ryan as Lockdown, the voice and the whole look of Lockdown was slick and one of the best designs i've seen since I first saw the designs of Prime and Bumblebee from the first film. I was disappointed that Hugo Weaving didn't reprise his role as Megatron because his voice was perfect but Frank Welker does a fine job as his replacement as I didn't even notice the difference while watching the movie.The action is the thing you go and see a Transformers movie for however and I just loved the action in this, its the most consistent of all the movies in the franchise. Optimus fighting Galvatron, Optimus fighting Lockdown, Optimus fighting and then riding a Dinobot, Dinobots being Dinobots, Aerial fighting, Bumblebee catching the humans in mid air. Oh my god this movie made me feel like a nine year old boy watching Transformers and Beast Wars on VHS and wearing out the tapes, just awesome.Overall, I still want a simple, ninety minute Cybertron Transformers movie but for now, this two and a half hour half human half robot Transformers movie is a fun time.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Let me tell you, he is not liked in Hollywood circles. But the fact is that as a filmmaker either director or producer he has been involved in some of the most visually extravagant and the biggest blockbusters of the last two decades. Every filmmaker has a style. His, could be applied to music videos, commercials therefor often the places he started in his career. As a feature film director Michael Bay comes back to the directorial chair to dazzle us viewers and overwhelm our senses in ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"". As humanity picks up the pieces, following the conclusion of ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"" Autobots and Decepticons have all but vanished from the face of the planet. However, a group of powerful, ingenious businessman and scientists attempt to learn from past Transformer incursions and push the boundaries of technology beyond what they can control - all while an ancient, powerful Transformer menace sets Earth in his cross-hairs. Big, loud, sometimes visually overwhelming and little too long for my taste being 165 minutes long, but in it's kind entertaining, even though the action might not have been put forth too well being so much of it in intensity, that as the viewer we tends to disengage from the plot. Do we even remember full plot after the movie is over...? Sometimes audience needs to have time to recoup. Michael Bay even start muting the sound design of some actions scenes trying to give a feel of being more in the head of the characters, but in this way often left picture almost alone to effect the viewer senses experiencing almost video game visuals. Specially in 3D. Some CGI looked great some not so much. All in all I was entertained for the most part. Some impressive action sequences that last long time. Is it over the top...?...yes! Godzilla like...specially the Hong Kong section. Loved Tucci and the love interest angle. Mark Wahlberg was very likable more so then Shia LaBeouf and delivered believable performance apart some stupid product placement gag with a Bud Light beer that just come out corny and there are more moments like that were the humor or the performance does not quite click. Nicola Peltz was so hooooooot and I and sure we will see more of her as she is growing up.If you are one of the viewers who truly dislikes epic visual extravaganzas, were the story and the plot give a backdrop to be able to extend the capabilities of visual special fx you might be disappointed in ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"", however if you more less liked previous movies you will enjoy this one with all its faults. Visually stunning (specially epic action scenes), with story and character development taking secondary role and a dose of Michael Bay's directorial style and not always on point sense of humor. All in all you know what to expect and what to expect to not get disappointed, if you know what I mean.

216,jefflouvre-435-77367,"An avalanche of explosions, special effects and rapid-fire editing that will numb your senses",5,27 June 2014,"THE fourth instalment in director Michael Bay's Transformers series is as brash, loud and excruciatingly painful to watch as the first one. Bay hopes to replicate the previous films' unusual success by doling out more of the same stuff: a pretty girl, Autobots vs Decepticons and wanton destruction.Bay's films are characterised by a surfeit of violence, rapid-fire editing and special effects, and a distinct lack of proper narrative. He believes that editing an action film is similar to editing a Formula 1 race, which means the film will go by in the blink of an eye.I was getting restless and my head was pounding by the time Transformers 4 reached its denouement. The jumble of images was annoying and the noise was pulverising any thought I had.I've seen the three previous films so I knew what to expect in terms of noise and confusion, but Bay has taken both points to a new level in this film.More at www.jeffleemovies.com",Transformers - Age of Extinction

I thinks transformers 4 is a good movie because there is action, the movie is very good for the cast special effect are really really good .I like the story it is slow in the beginning but the end is beautiful there are the full action, there are a fight there a the explosion it is a war. I doesn't like the moment when the women is in the space because is no fight it is very slow and sad. The best moment in transformer 4 is when obtimus prime go to fight the king of the robot, obtimus win the fight and the king help obtimus for the final fight. The end is weird because the builder of the enemy help the autobots , the movie is full action if you like the action, you can love transformer 4 for the action and the story, you should like it.
//In my opinion the movie is amazing. The special effects are really good, the sound of battle are wonderful, the robot looks real, the robot can also be transformed into a vehicle and I like the main characters. I like the colors in the movie, there are many colors.
The defect of this movie is the duration, the movie is so long. I am happy I say this movie. I think , this movie is so good because there is lot action. If you like action movie, you should watch this movie.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
218,mistela67,"Tired formula, still sort of works...",6,27 June 2014,"You know your Michael Bay movies; car chases, guns, military cheer-leading (limited this time around), shameless product marketing, lame comic relief, and of course, those lurid camera angles of sexy women. Well, that formula has worked throughout the Transformer franchise (with maybe the 2nd movie being the weakest link). And in Hollywood, what has worked before is what usually is the safe bet. So, you can expect to see more of the same in the upcoming Transformer movies, including Transformers 4.T4 has everything its predecessors had, even including some of the dialog. But this movie has rev'ed up the menace-factor. The main villain in T4 certainly fits the antagonist-bill, but this is a Transformers movie,so you can probably predict what its fate will be. There is also an odd abundance of English or Australian actors in this one, and you have a new, young blonde to gawk at, complete with her standard-fare daisy dukes. She's not up to par with Megan Fox, looks wise, but she'll get the targeted young male demographic happy to be sitting in the dark for nearly 3 hours. The action is, mercifully, non- stop, so much so that you don't mind the length of the film. But, as my title suggests, T4 is old hat. Marky Mark is an upgrade from the annoying but effective Mr. Shia, but even he's not treading any new material here. Basically, T4 is just the same thing with more eye-candy (of the CGI sort). The action becomes dizzying and mind-numbing toward the end, and there's never really any sense of true peril. Still, if you like your movies like Michael Bay likes his female actresses (one dimensional), this movie will do it for you. For the rest of us, Transfomers: Age of Extinction could be a yawn-fest if you are expecting something fresh.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
219,thomas-w15,Even worse than Revenge of the Fallen,2,20 November 2014,"Transformers: Age of Extinction 2/10- What would a guy like Michael Bay do if he wanted to make more than just a movie that will make money? If he wanted to not constantly get negative criticism because the Transformers movies he makes(with a slight exception of the first) have no plot or character development to speak of and have been called mindless action? He gets rid of every human character from the previous films and gets a badass lead actor like Mark Wahlberg to help him save the film. Unfortunately, even with the addition of Mark Wahlberg, this new installment in the Transformers series falls prey to the same routine of pointless action sequences, terribly written screenplay and dialogue, and as if it wasn't bad enough, we see this dragged on for nearly three hours. I could have been the one to tell Michael Bay that, yes Mark Wahlberg is a hundred times better than Shia Labeouf, but even Wahlberg can't play a badass while he is standing next to 150 foot tall giant metal alien robot. Not even if you give him a alien space gun that is for some reason just the right size for humans. I believe that he is a good actor but once the transformers enter the movie after about 25 minutes, there is literally no room for good acting left. A lot of people actually agree with me that the movie had some good potential at the beginning, but then the transformers start battling each other and kill it all. The only reason I did not give this movie a one is because the special effects were decent and I do appreciate, at least the attempt to try to change the franchise(though it was unsuccessful.) No matter how many movies I see, I am always impressed at how digital effects make it seem like a huge gigantic alien robot is right there next to an actor when in reality nothing was there to begin with. So, I guess the film did not screw everything up. I really just wish they would have taken a second to stop and look at the plot that they were making here(if you can even say this movie has a plot.) Everything was just transformers fighting each other all through out while the humans run away. There was not even any final battle to speak of, just a long hour and a half video game nearly. The only thing I liked about the battles sequences was that John Goodman was the voice of the hardened veteran transformer. Other than that, there is no upgrade from the other transformers films. As I said before, there is not much acting to speak of, but that is in no way the actors fault. They all did what they could and were definitely a step up from previous films. I would like to highlight Stanley Tucci though because he was by far the best actor in the scenes he could help and without a doubt made the movie easier to watch. I think that if you are a fan of the transformers franchise, you might like this film but you will definitely be wanting something more leaving the theater. For everyone else, I recommend that you wait until this movie comes out on DVD and even then its still a long shot.

220,dburris-45933,Transformers: Age of Extinction,6,29 September 2017,(SPOILER ALERT) Transformers: Age of Extinction was not really a bad movie. But it did take away the story beforehand and set it up with new cast members and a story that doesn't go along well from the previous films and yet was a little disappointing. But Interesting in my opinion.,Transformers - Age of Extinction
221,Alise_shenle,Really Good,9,20 July 2014,"I, for one, am not ashamed to admit that I find this movie really good. Without the talentless Megan Fox and ugly Shia Labeouf, finally the movie focuses more on the titular Transformers than the boring wimpy characters. This moving might be confusing because it is too long and there are way too many human characters, even I mixed up the 3 bad guys. That is why I didn't put 10 out of 10. However, it has many good points. 1)Mark Wahlberg might be old and not good-looking anymore, but he can act. He is believable as a father (Look at Brad Pitt, he didn't really seem to care about his World War Z family) from the way he keep on harping about his daughter, his dead wife and the daughter's boyfriend. 2)James Bond formula which took place in many different countries. From Texas to Beijing to Hongkong, this international platform gave us many surprises like ""Kungfu pole-fighting"" by Li Bing Bing (Ada from Resident Evil Retribution) and Han Geng (KPop Super Junior), with funny fake parkour scenes by Cade. 3)Dinobots. Did you know that the first dinosaur in the film is Scaphonyx (I'm an armchair expert on dinosaurs), which is supposed to be herbivore by the way, not carnivorous, and the period is Triassic, not Cretaceous. The movie provides an alternative explanation for the extinction of dinosaurs. 4)Optimus Prime gets more screen time as we see how noble he is. He did not blame Cade for what humans did, unlike the way the humans blamed Autobots for what Decepticons did. So Optimus Prime is not racist. 5)The lessons. Cade said that just because you made a mistake does not mean that nothing good will come out of it. By learning from his mistake (of getting a baby before marriage), Cade became very responsible. 6)Sacrifice. Cade gave up his house and almost his life to save some ""random strangers"" from Hong Kong. It is not his problem, but he's a hero. Unlike Sam Witwicky, what did he give up exactly? 7)Explosions. Always wanted to see giant vehicles getting sucked up and thrown back then exploding? Well now you can. 8)Beautiful girl and handsome man is available in the forms of Nicola Peltz and Jack Reynor (looks like Jensen Ackles). 9)Hi-tech science fiction. Unlike some movies where it does not seem so Hi-tech (I, Frankenstein, anyone?), this movie shows the corporation in its glory just like Amazing Spiderman 2. So in conclusion, just watch this movie. You will not regret it. Money well-spent.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
222,ad_upclose,What a load of...NOISE,1,29 June 2014,"Michael Bay Explosions Inc. is a fitting title that can be replaced with each film in the Transformers franchise. Also, at this point asking which Transformers movie is the best is like being asked which eye-ball you would prefer to lose in an accident; as of June 2014, this is the longest and most punishing film in the franchise. If you were hoping the newest installment would be a fresh start of some sort, the answer is NO! It is the same noisy and disposable circus-show with irritating humans & giant robots with lackluster designs (we get a fat cigar- chomping one) and awful lines.Mark Wahlberg finds himself running and jumping away from all kinds of destruction as he replaces Shia LaBeouf who has reportedly gone insane after being part of 3 Transformer movies (someone confirm that). We also find a new female lead; slow-motion shots and typical damsel-in-distress staleness intact. The first half of the film basically features forgettable exposition which often cuts to juvenile humor from father, daughter, and a boyfriend who can drive well.The special effects are impressive in parts as with all previous Transformers movies, but with the absence of good characters let alone a fun story, it all seems inconsequential.Overall, Transformers 4 will continue to excite fans who have clearly gifted a lot of money to the previous films. As for the rest, this is another loud and forgettable action movie. If you managed to endure the entire movie and did not end up with a throbbing headache, give yourself a round of applause.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
223,user-543-975655,Outstanding,7,1 July 2014,"First things first. This was overall a good movie. Yes there were some (maybe a lot) of mistakes, but that's okay. I liked the movie for its enjoyability, because it really is a fun movie to watch. I wouldn't say that it is the best Transformers movie to date, I am definitely not saying that, But I really like it. I thought that there were only a couple completely dull moments, and other than those, I was entertained the whole way through. The visual effects were so great and advanced so much since 2011, when Dark of the Moon came out. There were even more moving parts in the Transformers that it would be almost impossible to see all of them. One thing that helps with that though, is something that I talk about a lot in Transformers reviews. The slow motion camera effect. The slow motion has really gotten better as the series progressed. This movie contained the best slow motion of the series, and it really was awesome. Besides that, the acting in this movie was not as good as the first three movies. It was close for some of the characters, but some just couldn't act. For example, Nicola Peltz as Tessa Yeager. She just served as another Megan Fox and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. This means that she is the very pretty face that seems to recur in every Transformers movie. Except Megan and Rosie could act. Now, Nicola did have a lot of good lines, she just didn't execute them very well. Mark Wahlberg, as usual, was a great character in this movie. I did not expect him to do such a good job in this movie, because it was so different compared to his other movie genres. Meaning he doesn't do Sci-Fi movies that much, especially ones that involve giant robots. He was still really good though. He also played the fatherly role very, very well. T.J Miller did an even better job in Transformers: Age of Extinction than he did in Cloverfield, which was very surprising to me. He offered most of the comic relief that was needed, and also did it well. Stanley Tucci is often considered to be the best part of the movie. I disagree. While Tucci is a fantastic actor, I think he and Mark Wahlberg were tied. They both played very believable characters. Those are really all of the main characters. Next, the movie was extremely long. This is the longest of the series, and that's saying something. There were a few scenes that were completely pointless, and could have been done in a much shorter amount of time. 165 minutes (2 hrs 45 min) is an extremely long time to stay in a theater and keep your eyes on a screen. I liked all of the battle scenes and action, but I just wish some of them were shorter. Also, on the positive side again, I liked how this movie was on such a big scale, instead of just focusing on one state and city like the first Transformers mostly did. The Transformers are bigger, the battles are bigger, the ships are bigger, the destruction is bigger. That definitely made up for the pointless scenes in the movie. Anyway, almost nobody denies that the change of Autobots and Decepticons was not completely welcome. However, to my surprise, I didn't mind it that much. It kept the series fresh, and I liked the new Transformers when it was explained why there were there. And finally, the plot. Ehren Kruger and Lorenzo di Bonaventura and other writers always do a great job coming up with new stories and plots and characters and dialogue (which was okay save for maybe, 5-6 very cheesy lines and a few cringe worthy punch lines). The progression of this movie and its plot was fairly slow, and that is probably why the movie is so long. Overall, I liked Transformers: Age of Extinction a lot, and I thought it was a really fun movie to watch, especially in 3D. So, I recommend you go see it whenever you get the chance. Transformers 5 is coming out around 2016, and I will review that, but I will have plenty of reviews in between. Sorry I made the review so long. See ya!",Transformers - Age of Extinction

225,CrisMovieCorner,"""Unoriginality, ROLL OUT!"" (Stolen from Total Film)",5,17 September 2014,"A franchise that started with such promise, however the second and third instalment in the franchise were less than desirable. First was absolutely brilliant after that it was a rapid decline in quality, so the fourth film was less than desirable to me to say the least.This film was kind of a reboot/sequel to the third, it's a direct sequel in timeline, however the entire cast has gone and we have a completely new one.The film opens with massively over the top spaceships and Tyrannosaurus Rex's, well what did you guys expect? This is a Michael Bay film remember ha, is there any other way this could have opened. This sequel does have a very familiar feel as previous instalments, however this time we have a new family in the centre of the mass chaos. Finally the Witwicky family is gone, now we are following the Yaeger family, with the father Cade (Wahlberg) a pretty much broke inventor and his 17 year old daughter Tessa (Peltz) who accidentally discover a Transformer, well not just A Transformer, it's THE Transformer, they come across Optimus himself all beaten up and ruined.Then we have Harold Attinger (Grammar) who has made it his mission to hunt down all the Autobots that still live on Earth after the events in Chicago with the help of his own shall we say ""bounty hunter"" Lockdown (voiced by Mark Ryan). There is also billionaire crazy man Joshua Joyce (Tucci) who has set his sights on recreating his own Transformers by any means necessary.After Prime reveals himself to the Yeager family, there isn't even enough time to blink before the CIA are on the case tracking down the leader of the Autobots, resulting in Cade and co going on the run here we meet Tessa's boyfriend Shane (Raynor) who very coincidentally is an expert race driver, what are the odds? Prime sets out to find all the remaining Autobots on Earth, we are introduced to Joyce's man-made Transformer resulting in a pretty epic fight scene between Prime and said Transformers.After that? The film goes down hill faster than the Cool Runnings team practising for the '88 Olympics. The film is massively weigh down by running time that still baffles me now when I think about it, the Action sequences become a bit tedious and boring when they're just throw at you every other scene. Luckily we get good displays from Wahlberg, Tucci and Grammar in the human aspect to keep your mind from drifting, we even get a thoroughly enjoyable voicing by John Goodman who plays Hound.Overall, the film was nothing more than OK if I am being 100% with you guys/girls, it starts off pretty good the first act/third whatever way you phrase it with Grammar hunting down Autobots was a very fun watch. Then you get bogged down with unnecessary Action sequences, a crazy runtime, characters you can't relate to and to top it all off you get the Dinobots at about the 02:10 mark and they're barely in it. What a massive waste of one of the main selling points for the film. I can't even say, ""oh yeah it's a popcorn flick"" because that would be a lie at nearly three hours long, you get to a point were you're only watching it waiting for the Dinobots and while they are visually incredible as all the Transformers films are, they are hardly worth the wait, they are gone before you know it. In summary watch it if you're a Bay, Wahlberg or Transformers fan, if you are not stay well clear, it's three hours of Action Porn, and surprisingly that can get boring pretty quick.Added commentary if you will; If the franchise is to continue beyond this point in my honest opinion the human element needs to taken out of the equation. I'm not even sure what it's there, they have never been relatable characters, we do NOT need a human element. It was the main downfall of ""Pacific Rim"" also the forced human story. All we want to see is Autobots vs Decepticons battling it out on a a planet in Space, scrap the humans, have robots ripping each other to shreds, shooting rockets the lot. Then you will not have to worry about people complaining about characters development, poor script, over the top Action, because they are all mute points in a film in which good robots fight bad robots.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

The action scenes were the only real good parts of the movie, the 3D is worthless, and the characters-- WHY???!!

229,JontheLobsterLover,Easily the worst in the series.,2,29 July 2015,"If Michael Bay's intention was to rape our eyeballs with over use of visual effects, job well done. I am a fan of all the Transformers movies, even the despised ""Revenge of the Fallen"". I kept my expectations very reasonable going into this movie. It's a CGI orgy of action, which is what I was expecting. However, the CGI in this movie felt way too cartoony than the others. It was obviously made for a 3D release, but you should at least make it watchable and enjoyable to those who don't watch it in 3D. Probably my biggest gripe about the movie is the way the new transformers ""transform"". Watching the transformation as they morph from automobile to humanoid was always fascinating, especially to the eyes. The new transformations just seem like a quick and lazy way to move the movie along a few seconds faster. It is very disappointing to say the least. Finally, the acting is quite horrendous in my opinion. I love Mark Wahlberg, and I love his work normally. But in this movie his lines felt forced, and some of the dialogue that was supposed to be funny just sounds stupid, and it made for a very painful movie. Even O. Prime's dialogue was unbearable at times. The only actor who was somewhat redeeming, and only towards the end I may add, was Stanley Tucci. Kelsey Grammar also did a decent job, and I personally love the beard. It made him fit the character that much better.

Sensationalism rules, there is no connection to the characters at any time and the acting, directing and script are such a mess. This movie was one big pile of silliness. The only thing that kept me from not walking out were the Dinobots who I really wanted to see. Unfortunately they appear all the way in the end of the movie, and it wasn't really worth the wait because they were only put in for more destruction. And maybe is stayed there because Stanley Tucci is the only actor that rises above the mediocre performances of the others. The script was probably written by 10 different people who then tossed their ideas in a bowl and picked some story lines blindfolded. Or maybe this was a contest to help the scriptwriters and have viewers send in ideas what to put in the next Transformers debacle? It's 2 hours and 45 minutes long and I have no idea why. I think 1 hour could have cut easily, it would have made it somewhat better probably. And close some gaps in the storyline. But maybe not. It probably didn't help that the day before I watched this, a plane was shot down above Ukraine containing 300+ innocent people, most of them Dutch, so I was wondering all the time why you would want to make such a film as there is nothing constructive happening. Only destruction all the way through the film. I got seriously fed up with it.Not everyone I was with shares my opinion about this movie, some actually liked it. But I think this was the last Michael Bay film I have watched in my life. I hope these kind of movies go extinct, really. What a waste.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
232,CinemaCocoa,"Out with military glorification & toilet humour, in with Transformers!",8,11 July 2014,"This first part in a new trilogy by Michael Bay has restored most of my faith in the film franchise! Most of it. This outing goes to far edgier, darker places and actually gives the titular characters time and space to breathe!Set a few years after the events of the third film, Dark of the Moon, this new film opens with the bleak reality that humans have had enough of the Autobot/Decepticon war destroying Earth, the devastation of Chicago made as a public reminder of their menace. But the CIA has gone a step further: allying themselves with a mercenary Transformer called Lockdown, they are hunting down and killing all robots, including Autobots. Optimus Prime, who has been in hiding since Lockdown's appearance, is discovered by kind hearted inventor Cade Yeager (that's quite the name) his daughter and her boyfriend. Optimus then vows never to defend Humanity again... the cost has become too high...Let's talk about what's wrong with the film first. The robots have been given a new appearance, all except Bumblebee for the most part, and I don't really like them. What I like about the first films (especially 2007) is how you can see the vehicle (or alt) mode on the robot, here the characters are better and more distinctive, but the vehicle they turn into is completely lost. Example: the Autobot character Crosshairs has a longcoat, I have no idea how the coat goes into his car mode! Or Lockdown, he has a Lamborghini alt mode, but before he transformed into one I had no clue. There are also new Transformers. Sufficed to say, humans have acquired technology to make their own Transformers, and they have a very, very different way of transforming; think of particles, totally breaking down and reforming. I didn't like that.And tonnes of product placement. Good lord.But you could say these things are superficial, I really enjoyed the film. I enjoyed the hell out of it! You know all that dumb, childish, toilet humour of the first three films? You know: Sam's Mom; robot fart and pissing jokes; ""Deep Wang""; Wheelie humping Mikeala's leg; basically all of TF:RotF? None of that presents itself here, and I am not exaggerating. With the focus on Mark Wahlberg's Cade the story takes a more mature, edgier feel. Sure, there's still humour, but it is wittier than the teenage-grade jokes before. Bumblebee has some very funny dialogue. You know all that terrible rapid cutting and editing that plagued the first three films? Bay has actually listened to complaints and the action here is actually far more legible. You also remember all the overpowering glorification of the US military in the previous films? Gone. The military doesn't even feature in this movie! The robots take a more prominent role too. Lockdown is a vicious new villain! I really like his character, and the Autobots were lively, had very humanoid faces (something the fandom bemoaned about the first trilogy) and all very distinct from each other.The first act is decent. We see that our human characters are genuine (if very borderline pretentious, something Bay must avoid doing in the future!) I think Wahlberg knows how to work for Michael Bay, and the second act does some intense, dark stuff! I was actually surprised by some of the things they did: they clearly want to separate this from the pulpy, teenage melodrama of the previous films! Of course, the third act becomes overlong and the film's runtime is barbaric at two hours forty-five minutes! Completely unnecessary. But as these films go on, I feel like I am watching a TV series and just binging on a whole season at once!I will say it: I am stoked for more movies! If they can maintain what this film is going for, and don't screw it all up like they did with RotF, we could be on to a really good trilogy! I know what they are building up to now, there was a heavy theme of creators and creation in this film, and any fan will be able to tell you what's coming next. I liked this a lot.If you never liked the original trilogy, this probably won't change your mind (despite the lack of toilet humour and gaining an edgier tone) but if you are one of those people who are on the fence, uncertain, this will make you a fan again!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
233,calm,Too much confusing action but still a good movie!,8,16 July 2014,"The only reason I gave Transformers an 8.5 is because of it's non-stop action and story telling. I didn't really care for the endless plots within plots but I realize it's getting harder and harder to make these sequels interesting and meaningful. How many times can we humans be rescued by these unwanted machines (Autobots) and how many villains are out there trying to get a piece of the autobot action? Cade Yeager (Mark Walhberg) a struggling inventor, and his 17-year old daughter Tessa Yeager (Nicola Peltz) along with Shane Dyson (Jack Reynor) who plays Tessa's not so secret boyfriend, battle the bad guys together.Transformers: Age of Extinction begins millions of years ago, during the Cretaceous period which include dinosaurs. According to the story, Beings or Creators detonate many seeds causing the dinosaur's extinction on Earth. The story then picks up 4 years after the battle in Chicago, we're now focused on Cade Yeager and his business partner, Lucas Flannery (T. J. Miller). Down and out, Cade purchases an old truck he is planning to strip down and sell for parts. The truck turns out to be Optimus Prime who is in dire need of repair.In the meanwhile, Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammar), a CIA agent is assigned to hunt down the remaining Decepticons but is secretly hunting down Autobots as well. Harold gets help from a Transformer named Lockdown, who is a bounty hunter and along with Harold, kills Rachet. Cade tries to repair Optimus, after his identity is discovered and Optimus activates the remaining Autobots: Bumblebee, Hound, Drift and Crosshairs.Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci is head of the KSI Corporation and has perfected Transformin, which is the metal the Transformers are made of. Joshua has also imprisoned Brains, the Autobot's Drone sidekick to decode dead Transformers' brains, Megatron being one of them, for use in human made Transformer brains. As a result, KSI's ultimate Transformer, Galvaton is created. To complicate matters a little more, James Sovoy (Titus Welliver) is a field leader of Cemetery Wind, an elite CIA unit tracking Decepticons and Transformers along with Harold. James makes up the third bad guy and greedy human to round out this band of bandits. There are so many players, one can get pretty confused. You have the original Transformers (Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Ratchet, Leadfoot, and Brains), The bounty hunter (Lockdown), the man made Transformer (Galvaton) and a new species called Dinobots. You also have the bad guys versus the good guys and all that's in between.As usual, the original Transformers prevail and gives a speech about morals, life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Transformers: Age of Extinction is 2 hours and 47 minutes long but keeps moving so that you don't really notice the time. It started in Chicago and ended up in China. The destruction was enough to declare the world a dismal, hopeless, disaster. In case you didn't get it, this movie was all about getting the Seed, the only one left that could annihilate the Earth. Overall, lots and lots of action — worthy of the big screen. In order to put closure to this story so that it makes perfect since, take a leap of faith and buy a ticket, you probably will like it.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
234,georgebush,moneys worth,9,28 June 2014,Been to all the transformers. This is a brand new cast and somewhat different story. Gets going pretty quickly. Especially interesting was all the Chicago shots and a close view and extended scene at the old closed down Uptown Theater at Broadway and Lawrence in Chicago. This is across the street from the old Rivera Theater. This movie does not feel like you were cheated. It actually seems like the combined a part 1 and part 2 so it is like 2 films. If you like action then this is it. Walberg does fine. And his 17 year old daughter in the film can actually act. The interaction between her and Walberg is new and refreshing. She is a good actress which is a big step up from the other Transformers.The actual transformers Autobots and companies are great. In this film the actually carry on conversations. There is also reference to prehistoric times. This film is fast paced and can wear you out but that is a good thing. This film is not for wimps. The 6.6 score is OK but for action and fun its more an 8 or 9.Some of the old relationship stuff is less in this film and no weird parents. There are many great shots of Chicago. Many shots include the lake and so much more. The film continues with the international theme as the other movies. It is interesting when the film moves to China and Hong Kong. This film is not confusing. Ultimately the acting is an improvement in this Transformers. This film has as much action as the others. Even more. If you like long and strong action films this is it. You certainly get your moneys worth.,Transformers - Age of Extinction
235,jan_kalina,"""Sweetie, hand me my alien gun! """,10,17 July 2014,"What this franchise needed was an injection of something fresh, something new. That's exactly what it got with the arrival of new human cast, new government officials and redesign of the main Transformers. After the abysmal third installment, which ditched everything that was was awesome about the first two films. No Megan Fox,just simply dropping all the relationship built up in previous two movies, instead of her a model who can't act, plus her character wasn't surprised at all about seeing transforming cars, like that is a everyday thing. Bay went off the chain with the amount of humor in that film and most of the film was shown in all the trailers and TV spots released on the internet. That thankfully wasn't the case here.This is the darkest film in the franchise so far, the humor is much more toned down, the government of USA is way more involved than in any of the previous films and since the humans have to be in the film so we can shift our focus on them and spend less money on CGI, the humans actually have something and get involved in the fight, their aid is actually very meaningful.Michael Bay is in my opinion the best action director out there nowadays. No one can shoot action scenes like he does. His motto is ""If it can explode it will"". He is visual genius and I'm glad that after four Transformers films he remains just as creative and insane action-wise as before. This semi-reboot was trying to bring the magic from the unknown as the first film and it accomplished this mission. Mark Wahlberg's Cade Yeager from Texas (An odd name for a Texan) finds a truck and in a similar way as Sam Witwicky doesn't know that there is more than meets the eye. Bay and Kruger have enough ideas which could have been used in different movies but they stuff them all here. Mostly this film serves as an expansion of the Transformers universe. So now we have spaceships thrown in the mix which allowed Bay create many thrilling sequences (Yeagers on the anchor cables, spaceship chase). Wahlberg's Cade even gets to use an alien gun which coincidentally is human-sized but I am happy to overlook this because of all the fun it brings.Mark Wahlberg has proved himself many times before as a great leading man and this the focus of the human story is the father/daughter relationship instead of a boy hitting on a girl. Yo can bet that Bay will pick a beautiful girl because he's got a real knack for it. I mean he won't find another Megan Fox in his lifetime but Nicola Peltz is an outstanding replacement. Although 19 years old she serves as the eye candy in this film and Bay knows where to put a camera to make a girl look sexy. Jack Reynor doesn't show much acting because he has to make sure that Wahlberg is still a star of this show, but he looks as a promising actor. For the first time T.J. Miller seemed funny to me but unfortunately he has minimum screen time.By now you all know what to expect from a Transformers film. Bay has created the definition of a summer blockbuster. Big scope, loud action scenes, pretty girls, handsome men, explosions, robots - everybody gets what they want from a summer movie. I can't imagine anyone else making Transformers films than Michael Bay but on the other hand I want him to make films like Pain and Gain, so I guess anyway he picks his next project I will be looking forward to it. I just simply love how in every shot in every of his films there so much happening. If you enjoy his brilliant camera-work and his trademark shots(low angle shots, scenes taking place at sunset) which here are plenty, then you won't be disappointed.P.S. Michael Bay is very aware of the fact that he is making a sequel and he pokes fun at this fact in a way casual moviegoers will notice and give it a second thought.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
236,videodrome1234,Like Monster Truck,5,23 August 2014,"For those of you out there who like the Transformers films I have good news. No big changes happened in Michael Bay's alternative universe. There are still the usual pictures of the setting sun, his characters are flawlessly beautiful, the visuals are fantastic, the sound effects are earsplitting and the action sequences has never met a physics law that they haven't broken and the American flag keeps on flying and flying relentlessly. The few minor changes that did happen, without a doubt helped the franchise a long. Though they did promise us more, what we got was at least a step forward. After the relatively quiet first half hour, Bay really goes to town with the next two hours and 10 minutes of non-stop action. There are is no down time or slowed pace, it's just destruction, shaking cameras, some Matrix-type slow-mo and dramatic turns underscored with a epic tunes oh and action lots of action where the robots hit, cut, tear, kick and kill EVERYTHING. So if that's the type of film you want to see, you won't be disappointed. Of course there are a lot of functions of a film like this. One: You never have to think during the film. Two: If you like this type of film it will be a fun ride. Though the hyped Dinobots only got maybe 15 min. screen time, but just enough for kids to want dinobots for Christmas. And if we are on marketing the continuous product placement in the film is damn annoying. It's not enough that the whole film is a Hasbro ad, but even that ad is filled with ads for other products. Anyway let's talk about what Michael Bay is great at. He makes us forget and have a great time doing it. And what are we forgetting? Well the script and a basic story. This gives the film an interesting dichotomy. The visuals, the music, sound and the whole film is very professional, but the script is utter garbage. It's like Monster Truck races. It's great and all visually, but why are the trucks bashing into each other exactly? Who knows But who cares right? It's so damn fun to watch. So that's kind of what the new Transformers is like. It was a step forward in some respects. Despite the script seeming like it was just an empty stack of pages, at least they stop trying to get laughs with utterly lame jokes. Not much took their place but at least that was tossed. The other thing I thought was a positive step forward was getting rid of the cast from the 1st 3 films. Of course don't expect Mark Wahlberg do deliver and Oscar worthy performance, but it has to be said that he is much better suited to a film like this than Shia LaBeouf. In every other aspect we basically get more of the same. Of course why would Paramount let a recipe that has been working so far be changed? None of the previous films have lost money, why would they start doing it now? And it is true that this is a solid brand and those are hard to change. But if nothing else they could have got a really good script writer, I don't think that would have caused any problems. Then of course we have to talk about the most important aspect of a film like this: The visuals. When Pacific Rim came out everyone said that despite the script being way lame and the actors couldn't act themselves out of a box, it was unbelievably visually pleasing and has raised the bar for Transformers 4. Well Transformers accepted the challenge and they had a good go at it, even if they didn't take huge strides forward. All in all Transformers: Age of Extinction, though by just a small step, did move forward compared to its predecessors. I think those viewers will be the happiest who loved Optimus Prime and crew before, 'cause they'll love his adventures now too. They won't be disappointed. If you're not a die-hard fan this will probably not convince you to love them. For my part I love the big robot battles and Monster Trucks so 7/10 https://www.youtube.com/user/Videodromeblog",Transformers - Age of Extinction
237,arminhage,Almost 3 hours of pure junk,1,25 September 2014,"almost 3 hours of pure junk! This movies is not worth a lengthy review because there is nothing to talk about. Screenplay is flat from start to finish. There is nothing to this movie that I can talk. Some humans got caught in the middle of a robotic war, some funny looking Autobots (nothing like the descent Autobots from the original cartoon) are trying to gather their forces to fight off an enforcer from their supposed to be creator and its human collaborators. There is no logic anywhere in the screenplay. Autobots are way inferior compare to their rivals and yet they managed to defeat them not by any logical masterplan, they just defeat them, the logic got lost in nonstop but immensely boring action which is supposed to rip the audience off of any logical criticism. Even the vehicle array of is ridiculous. Some high end sports car rallying the streets, drawing attention where they are supposed to be under the radar and probably the funniest part was that a tractor (Optimus Prime) manages to escape the Ferrari. Bugatti Veyron is rallying behind the new Chevy Corvette, a cheap and insulting advertisement from GM proposing that the Corvette is as good as or even better than the Veyron, it was essentially the visual version of the cheesy radio ads which I hear everyday and I don't know where to hit my head as they are extremely insulting to my intelligence. Special effects are descent but nothing out of the ordinary nevertheless the opening scene with space ships and dinosaurs is felt like a scene out of Ice Age cartoon not a serious movie... reminded me of cheesy CG effects of Star Wars Episode I which predates this movie by 15 years! And who said this was a serious movie? Nothing makes sense, nothing! I wish Michael Bay would make and official statement announcing that he was making a movie for primary school kids buttered up with a nostalgic 80s cartoon to encourage parents to take kids to cinema! Also apparently China is not a rival to United States anymore but a puppet state which which American companies freely make weaponry for US army in their territory. All it takes to take down the alien ship and the circus of robots is an old fashioned 1950s nuke but who wants to nuke them over the ocean? nuke ends the auto show in 2 minutes!

My brothers and sisters, those of you who have sat through 3 Transformers flicks and managed to survive, I first let us remove our hats to those who bailed out after Transformers 2 and pour a little popcorn out for the homies who gave up after that train wreck of a movie Transformers 3 and now for all of you who are ready for the next exploding sensory overload, let me throw some words of caution out to you. This is not a movie, it is a two and a half hour exploding toy commercial directed by a 12 year old boy with a head full of Red Bull, a box of 4th of July fireworks and his father's girly book stash. Forget script and acting and everything else I would normally mention in a review this flick is nothing but explosions, fighting robots, explosions, sexy barely legal (and sometimes less than illegal) bimbos, explosions, American flags, explosions, one liners, explosions and good old Marky Mark Wahlberg. That is absolutely ALL that it is. So if you're still interested in that I highly recommend it but if you're not, you are going to hate it's robotic guts! Its disgustingly over the top, uncomfortably sexual, seizure inducing and absolutely out of control.

243,mr_iceman,Unwatchable,1,18 October 2014,"This review is coming from a long time Transformers fan from the toys as a kid to the earlier movies.This release basically took a large dump on the previous 3 (decent) movies and barely gave credit to them for even facing the avalanche of faeces to ensue.Let me start off with the irritating items: The entire new cast was a major problem for me, from the semi-wise and over-possessing dad (Mark Wahlberg)to his vapid daughter (Nicola Peltz) whose sole role was to incoherently scream and run from one corner to another with mini shorts. The auto-bots have some new recruits of which we've never seen nor heard of, including a Samurai auto-bot which comes complete with an Asian accent, to a fat commando-like auto-bot carrying a machine gun and constantly threatening his colleagues and arbitrarily aiming his shotgun at them.The fun now begins with cliché after cliché such as the auto-bots constantly genuinely questioning their position at helping the humans and Optimus-Prime fathering them and begging them to remain steadfast. Also the golden cliché is not missed when Optimus gets his ass severely beaten by what seems as indestructible foe, then rising up and bashing the same enemy to a pulp.My biggest problem in this movie is the sheer hypocrisy that these auto-bots have indulged in during their sparring with the other enemies. At times they seem to be directly (and enjoyably)responsible for killing civilians such as hurling a car, or just splash damage in and around a populated city.If you haven't seen this movie yet, save your 3 hours",Transformers - Age of Extinction
244,raj040492,New Doors have been opened,7,28 June 2014,"When a nomadic transformer with a mobile prison and a rogue CIA black- ops division descend upon a common target, Optimus Prime , who has taken refuge with a struggling inventor ( that's what he calls himself but I don't agree) things become chaos and Michael Bay has tried to bring order out of the aforementioned Chaos with helping hands from CG department.Transformers:Age of Extinction is the continuation to the Transfomers Saga which happens to keep going on and on and on. Movie starts five years after Chicago where everyone is anti-alien thanks to the goliathic ego of one CIA top brass who has convinced the world that both Autobots and Decepticons are injurious to health. When Optimus wakes from his brief siesta he is forced to go gun-blazing and then, well that part is obvious. People die. Accidents happen. Humans make mistake and ultimately repent. Autobots save the day after destroying countless skyscrapers in the process. End of story. Oh sorry about that. The story ends only so that another sequel can be made. Yes, with few untied loose ends there is bound to be a sequel and it's only a matter of time before the official announcement is made. The franchise has reached a saturation point where it does what any other franchise would do. Explore the emotional side of the characters. Till now, Autobots were nothing but mean fighting machines that always end up on top. But this time around the story has been scripted with their conscience as center-stage. Every time an innocent metal is broken, Optimus pains as if it was his own and reaches a point where he no longer cares about the humans but is ultimately talked out of it.It is however ironic to see Optimus Prime as a wretched truck with the bumper sticker that says ""Got Ammo?"" while Bumblee bee occupies less screen time than he did last time. However there are new additions at the end, one of them being the Dinobot (strange name, given the fact that spits fire. Might as well call him Dragobot).At 164 minutes, this is easily the longest movie in the franchise. This could be a downfall for those who are not used to watching lengthy movies. The usual cast is replaced by the new ones who are more of a supporting cast when things go south. Mark Wahlberg is the protective dad who, even in the middle of intense crossfire, is more worried if his daughter's boyfriend gets close to her . He calls himself an inventor, yes he is very much similar to Tony Stark except that none of his tech works or works in the opposite direction.As usual, CG is the hero with all kinds of aerial craziness alongside some kick-ass robots who literally live up to the said adjective. On the whole, a better writing than the previous three which has opened new doors to the next set of money-making sequels.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
245,PeterWorthers,The Heart is gone.,4,27 June 2014,"Spoilers abound Folks...Seriously.Transformers Age of Extinction is exactly what you would expect. A huge blow em up, shoot everyone, run run run type of movie again. Bay tries so hard to separate this from the other Transformer movies, like the theme music we're all used to is gone, the beginning title sequence is different, even the 'feel' of the movie is different. There's also lots of light flares (thanks JJ Abrams) and various liquids 'getting all over the screen' for extra added effect. But this entry also has a TON of cussing and a bunch of on screen human deaths. A darker tone indeed. The only down side is that now those 'totally awesome looking robots' we all came to love in the first movies now look SO fake and computer generated that it hurts to look at it. I doubt ANYTHING in that movie was real. It all had a 'cartoon-ish CGI' feel to it. Almost like 'What kind of robots can we make and how can they destroy a city or each other' and the script and heart of the story went out the window.Bay even tries to throw Mark Wahlberg, his daughter and her boyfriend in as the humans we should care about, but we're introduced to them then thrown into the action so quickly that we don't really relate to them or care about them like we did Sam Witwicky from the first trilogy, we only care about the situations they are in. New 'eye candy' Nicola Peltz is Wahlbergs daughter (which is not believable AT ALL, not even for a second) who couldn't act her way out of the the short short daisy dukes she squeezed into. Is it THIS hard to find a hot chick who can ALSO act Mr. Bay? Or here's an idea, make the movie about ROBOTS and forget the Victoria's Secret models all together. I don't think the 7 year olds this movie is geared towards will mind at all.This movie had a few problems and if you will humor me for a moment....1-ALL Asians know karate and will jump into Kung-Fu at any time. Even if they have no idea why the fight is going on, they just jump in at random. Fact.2-Women (no matter how strong or how much of a 'ball buster' they appear as at first) are only good for wearing short shorts and revealing clothes while crying and screaming as they are holding on for dear life waiting for the male hero to save them. 3-Even with Decpticons all over, the GOVERNMENT is the REAL bad guy. ALWAYS. 4-Any time Michael Bay holds an audition for Asians, the role is always running in a crowd from a huge robot rampage while screaming things in Chinese at random. 5-Even if you are just going to the toilet for a second, if the toilet and or entire bathroom does not explode as you walk away, with a chase scene to and from the room, YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG. 6-Seriously, how many times can you kill Megatron then have him come back. When will we learn? 7-The 'comedy relief' sidekick got annoying after the first 5 minutes. Then they had the good sense to kill him off early, but after a quick 'sorry for your loss' this friend of so many years is never thought of or mentioned again. 8-Every 5 minutes it seemed that the action would slow-mo and some Imagine Dragons song would play as Nicola Peltz and her boyfriend Jack Reynor would do something 'romantic'. Umm, there's robots shooting all around, the city is being destroyed and hundreds are dying around you, kiss some other time huh? 9-Dinobots--AWESOME. But they are only in the last 10 minutes of the film, none of them talk or say anything and then Prime 'gives them their freedom'. Excuse me, you transform into a huge T Rex, how are you gonna hide on earth where no one will find you? Good luck with that. 10-Autobot technology is pretty awesome alright, but gets lost really easy by alien robots just to be discovered by us little humans then hidden away where no Autobot or Decpticon would ever find it until we accidentally use it at the last minute and Prime has to save us all. All in a days work I guess. 11-So there's this top secret CIA/evil corporation technology and a hick dude from Texas gets hold of it and hacks into it in 10 minutes with old computer stuff from an abandoned gas station? Really?I could go on and on but you get the point. Transformers 4 was exactly what it was meant to be - A huge summer movie, but if you're looking for something to make up for Dark of the Moon or a reason to look forward to this 'New trilogy', you're out of luck.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
246,SugarandIce,Everything hurts,6,23 July 2015,"I realize now that I have personal issues. That has to be the answer. I can't think of any other reason besides self-loathing that I would put myself through nearly three hours of another Michael Bay movie. Admittedly, these movies haven't gotten any worse since Revenge of the Fallen, but that deserves as much praise as a mass murderer deciding to spare me on a whim. I'll name the pros for this film first. The Dinobots have very nice designs. The villain in this movie is also decently competent and dangerous. There's also more personality added to the Autobots. Lastly, the obnoxious characters and humor have been toned down.Given those were the major complaints of the previous movies, you probably think that Michael Bay has actually made a good movie right? That's just not how the world works sweetie. While the excesses of the previous movies have lessened, we are still left with a soulless CGI-fest with an obscenely bloated running time. The human characters are dull, (although Kelsey Grammar tried his best. Bless his soul), the action is constantly being cut off, and the story is all over the place. If it had been trimmed down to an hour and half, this movie might at least be considered decent. However, as it is, it's just another example of how not to direct a blockbuster.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
247,thechair,Not Good,4,11 July 2014,"I had seen the bad reviews for this film but figured, ah, these people don't like Transformers anyway; I like the first and third instalments, even if the second was execrable toot, and the effects will be cool, it'll be mindless fun etc.Mindless, yes. Fun, no.For the first hour, it paces along, perhaps a little too slowly, but still entertainingly enough, even if they were trotting out the same boring Black Ops stuff the President doesn't know about (it never goes RIGHT to the top, does it? Hats off, Clear & Present Danger!). After that initial hour however, it takes a nosedive. Plot elements are thrown into the mix in a way that seems designed to strip them of actual worth or interest, the transformers generally stop transforming (when they do, the updated morphing effect is far less effective than the previous, clunkier changes), and the whole thing gets so incredibly tedious that I simply couldn't wait for it to end, staying only in the vain hope of a surprise or two, a hope that was dashed again and again.How can a film with this much action be so lifeless and dull? The human factor? Wahlberg and Tucci liven things up as much as they can, but outside pointing out what is going on, no one gets to say anything that lends itself to actual character outside entirely stock motivations (essentially, concern for relatives or money). The transformers? Pfft, we've been there and done all of this before, and better. There are simply no emotional scenes in the movie (barring a very early Autobot hunt which IS effective) and those that seem like they ought to be feel entirely weightless. Plus: not that I thought Dinobots would ever be a particularly good addition, but if Bay wants to boast about them then he might as well have them affect the story in some meaningful way. Dull. Rubbish. Avoid.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
248,agblum,"Some Fun, Some Stupidity",7,29 June 2014,"I certainly didn't go into Tranformers: Age of Extinction expecting a classic. The Postives: A Great Performance from Kelsey Grammar as the villain – Gov't Co-Ops Agent Harold Attinger, out to destroy the Transformers. Stanley Tucci also does a great job as Joshua Joyce – Inventor and Owner of the a Robotics Company in league with Krammer's character to take down the Transformers. Mark Wahlberg does an alright job as Cade Yeager, the new lead, taking over for Shia LaBeouf from the last 3 movies. He is a struggling Texas Barn Based inventor, trying to raise his teenage daughter Tessa (Born just before he was out of High School), portrayed well by Nicola Peltz, alone, following the death of his wife. Except for the opening sequence, the Special Effects are good. The Negatives: He is only in two scenes, but the character of the President's Chief of Staff is a portrayed as a word bumbling moron – A little hard to believe to say the least. While The story is a good one – The dialogue at times is stupid. The movie is fun though a good amount of the time. Final Verdict: Mixed - 2 3/4 out of 4 Stars.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
249,oldman007,"Better than the last two, but does not beat the first one.",7,30 June 2014,"Within the first few minutes we are thrown into the action we all know and love. There is quite a lot of character development between all of the characters. While taking its time to introduce the characters such as Mark Wahlberg and his daughter, it does not take long until we come face to face with The Transformers we all love and have awaited for.The acting is good (especially from Wahlberg), and I was pleasantly surprised with how good Kelsey Grammar is at changing his voice and giving us an evil accent and convincing accent. He ain't no Side Show Bob, let me tell you! Stanley Tucci even had his moments of excellent acting in this action packed movie.The CGI has improved a lot since the ""Dark Moon"" and has brought us a new, interesting form of technology. All the new Transformers have all been upgraded to the brand new form of technology. The action scenes are always a blast to watch. Never disappointing in that sense.But, in all seriousness, I do prefer Mark over Shia (little brat), and I think Mark Wahlberg has proved he can play in almost anything. Nicola Peltz, well, she had me at hello from the moment she showed up on screen. Her legs and her beautiful face in 3-D just wanted me to be with her! Way better than ""Dark Moon' and ""Revenge of The Fallen."" I highly recommend it.

250,sean-curtin-517-748378,A seriously underrated Transformers movie,10,27 December 2014,"This is a seriously awesome Transformers installment.I'm giving it a straight 10 as I absolutely loved it.Boring? WHAT? Did these guys even bother watching the movie? Did they fall asleep due to sleep deprivation or something? Perhaps there just too spoiled rotten by something. Plain and simple.In a nutshell this is an amazing Transformers installment. You get to see the Dinobots for one thing but best of all a new piece of the puzzle in the Transformers background is revealed and oh what a great story to continue on.Essentially if your a fan of the Transformers and enjoy action, there's simply nothing to loose.Personally I thought getting rid of some of the characters from the past 3 movies and introducing the inventor story line featuring Mark Wahlberg was a brilliant idea and adds a new story arch and a whole new group of people who bring faith back to the Autobots in the form of human goodness.It's an amazing film with my only question being: How did Optimus prime recover? Besides that, it's incredible. Seriously amazing film making and anyone who's bagging it is simply not a real fan. They can't be because if they were, they would see the gold in highlighting all these characters in amazing ways. The story is simply told on the run, some people can't deal with that but if your a Transformers fan, you will not be disappointed.Don't listen to the nonsense, this is a great film and I thoroughly enjoyed it.Way to go Michael Bay, an incredible new episode in the Transformers saga.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
251,jasonpachar,Best of 4,10,27 June 2014,"Alien robots attacking alien robots; alien robots attacking humans; human attacking alien robots. In one word: Mayhem. Destruction, catastrophe, heartache, heartbreak – those are the words to describe the 4th installment of the biggest franchise in movie cinematic history.In 2007, just 8 years prior to this year – we were first introduced to an alien species who wanted to cohabit with the human race on earth, but there were some who wanted to annihilate the human race to rebuild a other planet.In 2009, revenge was bittersweet between the Autobots and the Decepticons – the latter decided to destroy the earth with the converging of the suns to destroy them and therefore destroy humankind as we know it.In 2011, the moon was darkened by a Prime who was sent there to destroy the very existence of every living thing. Lord Megatron is ultimately defeated – or so we thought.Now just 4 years later in 2014, the pattern continues – but this time it has gone way too far. Though some did not see it but the legacy of Megatron lived on in the humans. His mission from the very beginning was to destroy the human race and leave nothing on earth but piles of dust and rust. But this time with the help of another generation of unlikely human heroes, they were able to foil Megatron's plans once more. I have a feeling that we will see him again.Transformers: Age of Extinction was by far the best movie of Summer 2014 and the best movie of the Hasbro Transformer Franchise. Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg – one word – just one ""AWESOME."" These two gentlemen are the epitome of Science Fiction movies – they know what they are doing and I can't wait to see if there is going to be a 5th movie. The acting in this movie was way beyond superb – Mark Wahlberg – you fit in nicely. Kelsey Grammar – you took the name of villain to a whole new level.As the Transformer slogan goes it's all ""More Than Meets the Eye"" – it's all about looking to the heavens and ask – Are we alone?",Transformers - Age of Extinction
252,smashthecontrolmachine,Just go see this in Imax 3D,10,29 June 2014,"Ignore any negative reviews please and just do yourself a favor and go see this movie for yourself and see it in Imax 3D as that is how it's meant to be experienced. Yes it's a long movie but with the all the breathtaking action and brilliant effects you won't want it to ever end. Most of the audience in the theater I went to was standing and clapping at the end of this movie. You've never seen brilliant 3D effects as you will in this movie, I don't care how many 3D Imax films you've been to. There is 3D action in the very beginning of the film that is honestly the BEST I've ever seen, ever. Throughout the 3D effects are definitely to the max and in most cases they are definitely over the top in the best way possible. I found myself absolutely glued to my seat for the whole movie which is very rare for me. I have to say I also quite enjoyed the humor in this one too, the humor is I think necessary in these movies to relax you from the sometimes very intense action scenes, the humor is a nice break and so I do find it refreshing. I think the humor is well placed too. The action sequences though and cinematography are this films holy grail. Really it's why we love these films. This isn't as much an action film as it is an action experience. You will feel honestly like you're in there battling alongside these transformers. You'll feel the effects of each battle scene in BRILLIANT, I mean MAGNIFICENT eye popping 3D glory. You'll not want any scene to be over and I am not exaggerating here. Do yourself a favor, if you only see one Imax 3D movie this summer, let it be this one.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
253,fabiolpinheiro1993,"Excellent, but didn't meet my expectations. (and, stop the hate)",8,26 June 2014,"I will never understand how can a franchise like this that makes more money with each sequel, more audience, can be so hated like almost no other franchise. I guess it all started with Revenge of the fallen, but i cant see what all the fuzz is about, and nowadays seeing a transformers film, then making stupid comments about it without any real reason for hating it is what passes as being cool on the internet world. Instad of making constructive reviews its better to be funny. Even if tons of films that are loved by all makes the same mistakes or steals ideas (lets say: Avengers and that signal to open a portal to aliens or the aliens ships, and the massive destruction of a huge city with tons of explosions, New york, clearly all ideas stolen from Dark of the moon and so on...) But enough of this, because no matter what, people will hate the film even if they liked it. So the film is completely different than everything I've seen, i wont say its original, but is different, at least from the previous installments. This time around there's no military guys, and the characters are all related which is something i really liked. The tone is much more serious and dark, especially in an early scene in which the CIA kills Ratchet. The new characters are much better that the previous ones, and the cast is amazing. One thing i really liked was the fact that the transformers are now the main characters, and each one gets a lot more characterization. Optimus in this one is incredible, the idea that he no longer has to save the humans is brilliant. The cinematography is just superb like always, and the sets amazing. This one had some very cool ideas too, like the zoo on lockdowns ship, and the ""seed"". But it wasn't all perfect, overall this one didn't meet my expectations. The sound was somewhat weaker and it felt like a mix of the previous films, the prologue was a nice change but it was my least favorite, the pace in the first act has some problems, but nothing to worry about, the special effects were just incredible as always, but there is some scenes that didn't work very well, like the dinobots where everything felt too cgi at times, and speaking of dinobots, they weren't my favorite part of AOE, also the action while still like no other, had some scenes that seem like a best off of the franchise, and overall it wasn't as much explosive, nor extravagant, nor loud, nor creative and intense like the previous films, nor like everyone made me believe. It didn't had one scene that managed to top the ones from Dark of The moon (like the highway scene, the building, the invasion of Chicago, the wingsuit jump....) It all felt to rushed and quick to end, sometimes it would have been nice to have a longer and creative sequence of action instead of millions of tiny scenes. However there is a scene, the one with the gravity generator, that was incredible, and by far the best one in the film, as well the one with the best sound effects. But still there's no film that can do action like this one, nor a director that can create and stage scenes of this scale, say what you want, but Michael bay is the best action director of all time, and no matter what he has his vision. The score was cool, and the dialog wasn't so bad like everyone is saying, not by a stretch. My favorite one still remains Dark of the moon, and the the one with the best sound, Revenge of the fallen. Pherhaps my expectations were to high, but i still loved a lot, just not as much as the previous ones. Still i give it a 10, because it is excellent anyway. If you are planing to see it, see it on IMAX 3D, because its the perfect format for this one, and it has the most footage in Imax I've ever seen, also it is probably the best 3D film I've seen.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
254,HorrorFan6969,It is not the worst movie of all times or mediocre... watch the movie first Bay haters !,7,2 July 2014,"To thoses who said it's mediocre and long it is Transformers, not Titanic crap. Thank you ! I start my review with a true bash at thoses who said this movie is junk, crap or whatever the word you like it is not, if you are a fan of the Transformers. Put aside it's from Michael Bay, it's a Transformers film, the one we were waiting for, for a long long time. It shows Transformers more than half of the movie, which is an improvement over the past three movies. Don't get me wrong, i'm a huge fan of this series. OK, the 2nd wasn't really what we hoped for. It was still watchable even if it's the worst in the series.Transformers 4 aka Transformers : Age of Extinction aka Tr4nsformers is to me, the best of the franchise as of yet. It runs at 2 hours 46 solid minutes with Mark Wahlberg outshining Shia Labeouf is all of the past 3 Transformers he stars. Shia Labeouf was my only problem with the films. And now, he's gone. Not that he's a bad actor, not at all, but he was not good in this kind of big blockbuster films. With a veteran like Marky Mark, the good vibrations were there. The superstar from past films like ''Fear'', ''Three Kings'' or ''Shooter'' put on a very strong performance here. His co-stars are great too, Stanley Tucci, always a good laugh with this pure actor and Kelsey Grammar as the main bad guy is quite enjoyable too.But the real cast is the Transformers. They upgrade in some ways, and in some ways, they are like the old school ones. Optimus Prime is back and more stronger than ever but his enemies, oh my god, they give him a harsh time. Bumble Bee is also back as the semi-leader. In my opinion, the best that this series could do one day is to give him the full lead for one movie. But Prime, is Prime and no one can stop him.I don't want to spoil anything, but if you like the past movies, you are easy audience. If you don't please don't listen to critics. I'm a kid of the 80s and this movie really represent the 5 years old kid that i was when i start liking this great franchise. Give it a try !!! 9/10",Transformers - Age of Extinction

He happens to buy a old truck which happens to be Optimus Prime. Then the film starts with furious action, action and Action for the next complete two hours. Though the CGs are well made and in fact very nice to watch on 3D experience but the screenplay, characters and plot is not creating any interest to the audience. Screenplay just wanders over in many direction. Its definitely 30 mins added run time! If that was trimmed and made crisp , the movie would have got much more positive response than this ./",Transformers - Age of Extinction
256,LeDentalPlaque,Fully-Loaded with Epic Action & CGI,9,28 June 2014,"Transformers is a franchise that began in the 1980s, and it wasn't until 2007 that a live-action film was made starring Shia Labeouf and Megan Fox. Personally, I found that the first Transformers film and the introduction of such amazing CGI and special effects was groundbreaking and shocking. It's the first time we've seen real cars turn into real Transformers, and they were done so well. Even the sounds when they transformed were believable. It was a job well done, and even though audiences may not have like the acting or the storyline, the CGI in itself should have been the focus.The next two sequels, ""Revenge of the Fallen"" and ""Dark of the Moon"" were released a couple years apart from each other. Obviously, the CGI was amazing, but the story lines seemed to falter as the sequels progressed. ""Revenge of the Fallen"" kept all of the main cast from the first movie, and the same types of dorky humour were conserved. However, with ""Dark of the Moon"", it was a bad move to introduce so many new characters and still keep Shia Labeouf as the main character. It's hard to associate one main character with so much change, and it puts a dent in the entire sequel because you hope to keep everyone from the original two just for continuity purposes. Now fast-forward to ""Age of Extinction"", which is the 4th movie in the Transformers live-action franchise. It's now completely reinvented with a new cast and a new story, even though it takes place 5 years after the incidents in ""Dark of the Moon"". Personally, I think this was a good move because the series needed a fresh start again, and a new storyline to pursue instead of lingering on to Sam Witwicky.First of all, it's important to say that we already know what's coming in this movie: a LOT of CGI and epic action scenes. It's what every Transformers movie has been so far, so why would this one be any different? I've heard a lot of people say that they hated this film because the storyline sucked and that it wasn't worth their money, but in all honesty, you're not paying to see a Transformers movie for the acting or the drama. You're paying to see the CGI and how much better they could possibly be compared to the previous Transformers movies. And no, ""Age of Extinction"" does not disappoint in this area.My overall rating for this movie was a 9/10 because in the context of why people would go and watch this movie, it delivers what it's supposed to successfully: mind-blowing special effects. I personally thought that the storyline itself was good because it provided viewers with a fresh start, and Mark Wahlberg was a great replacement for Shia Labeouf. There's no more of that dorky humour, but rather a more mature cast with better humour that is more acceptable. The movie also focuses on the Transformers quite a bit and takes away most of the human element in the film (even though there are some key moments with humans involved), but that's exactly what is to be expected for a film so focused on CGI. For those who really enjoy special effects and have enjoyed any of the previous Transformers films, I'd highly recommend watching this one because I think it's one of the best out of all 4. For those who look deeply into the storyline and only care about great acting and drama, I wouldn't bother purchasing a ticket because you won't find what you're looking for in this movie except 3 hours of non-stop action and CGI. For those who have never seen a Transformers film, I'd still recommend giving it a go because it's a new story with new characters, and it's 3 hours of amazing special effects...so it's well worth the money to sit through the entire thing.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
257,alucard_castlevania86,"Apart From The Plot, Just The Same O Same O Michael Bay Style As Usual And Its Getting Old Really Fast",6,30 June 2014,"Hhhmmmm.. where to begin with this one? I watched it with my brother last week and I have a mix bag with this one. One things for sure, it is an improvement over the last 2 sequels which were pretty terrible and nearly went to a dead end in my opinion. This sequel did bring back some good moments. The plot this time around was more interesting and as its not all the usual Autobots v.s Decpticons cliché anymore. They really took it to a different direction this time with the story and that's what worked for meSome of the robots being used in this movie were great to watch and I really liked the design of Stinger (evil version of Bumblebee). However, Galvatron turning into a semi truck just like Optimus Prime is not something that I expected. I still preferred it better if they had stick to his jet fighter transformation instead. However, apart from a few heroic and laughable moments from Prime and Bumblebee, there's not much wow factor from both the Autobots and the Decepticons Once again this movie relies too much on special/visual effects, actions with tons of explosions, building being destroyed and slow motion captures as their main attraction (which were kind of horribly made). In other words, there nothing much new to see here. Another thing that I didn't like was the splitting up liquid like form before transforming from vehicle to robot style didn't look real to me at all but my biggest complain would to be the movie itself being 3 hours long. The plot became a bit stall as the story progresses and I just couldn't see the point of showing it that longThe actors however did a pretty good job for their respective roles. Mark Wahlberg was awesome as Cade Yaeger and I liked his character better than Sam Witwicky because unlike Sam, Cade is a single father to a teenage daughter so its understandable why he whines and gets overprotective most of the time. I really enjoyed Stanley Tucci's character too. At first you just feel like you want this guy dead so badly but as the story progress, you kind of feel sorry for him. Jack Reynor plays the cool boyfriend really well and I really liked the argument moments between him and Cade. Nicole Peltz was a disappointment because once again she's just basically there for the attraction of the movie and nothing much. She can't outmatch Megan Fox but she certainly does a better job than Rosie Huchington WhiteleyWell, I think that sums up my review without saying too much I hope. Overall, it was OK just that 3 hours with lots of pointless explosions and slow motions really got me kind of bored going into the first 1 ½ hours of the film. However, it was still a decent effort from Michael Bay and an improvement over the last 2 sequels which in my opinion was very disappointing but this is one movie which I think isn't worth seeing again in the theaters",Transformers - Age of Extinction
258,paul_tremblay,A Visual Feast or a Confused Nightmare...?,4,11 October 2014,"One of the attributes of some avant-garde films is that there seems to be no plot, or so little, that like modern painting the color or shape speak for themselves. Transformers – Age of Extinction appears to be faithful to this description and should, therefore, be considered a subversive piece of art. But let's explore it a tad more. From the days of Bunuel and Dali and Léger and other avant-garde pioneers, the supposed intention of a seemingly unarticulated and dysfunctional narrative was to comment on mainstream filmmaking, to create new meaning through the finding of a new film grammar and syntax. It worked, for the most part, from Paterson to Kubelka to Brakhage to Deren.Will one day someone come up with a brand new book about Michael Bay, avant-garde filmmaker?It is true that we can barely glimpse the shadow of a story dripping off the brouhaha of clanking metals and steel in TAOE; and it does look as if they intended to show us a rough print of the movie. Can't wait until they come up with the Special Edition: The Edited Version... Would maybe amount to a viewable 45 minutes.However it is also possible that Michael Bay wrote the equivalent of a Six-Flag ride for the screen because one question will be worth asking for the hypothetical book: Can plot less narratives and messy visuals be the new avant-garde? It can certainly not be an independent cinema! With over one billion in revenue, TAOE does not qualify as an indie film.Human characters motivations are weird at best and submitted to the will of the runaway train which substitutes for a narrative, and their stories. What to think of old teenagers in love, a confused father... a bizarrely intentioned Defense official whose behavior cannot be explained (if he hates all transformers so much, why does he trust the robotic bounty hunter?...), a CIA assassin who seems eager to revenge his sister, a captain of the industry making a 180 following a simple phone call, etc. All seem to have very little to do with the fact that earth is about to be annihilated, as one reviewer noted.OK, maybe it is a comment on our selfish society? Maybe; we do worry about ourselves first and think little of our neighbors' plights, much less the rest of humankind.But here's how TAOE can't be categorized as either an indie or avant-garde movie: every single plot development (big words for this film) or character action/choice is automatically motivated by whatever will create the greatest bang and destruction. The China sequence is a good example as the ""bad guys"" decide to search and kill the ""good guys"" only and only because the alternative would have meant less explosion.The different pauses in the narrative exist only to provide us with a breather; you see, these pauses are plot holes in their own rights. Some of those pauses are caused by killers and the bounty hunter losing sight of Optimus Prime. There 's absolutely no rationale behind the bad guys losing track of Optimus Prime... twice (one of them when they were practically sitting on him).It is interesting to see how many movies today (Hollywood and otherwise) are constructed as a visual ride with very easy to dub dialogs (camera rarely remains stable long enough to see lips move, so it's very convenient to realistically dub actors) and replaceable characters. This reminds me of the early silent comedies which were international successes because the visual spoke to everybody of any culture: same with a Michael Bay flick. A non-Michael Bay movie, Pirates of the Caribbean was based on a park ride, but at least they made it into a movie! Today's movies, for some anyway, are turned into a ride, to speak to more than local spectators and satisfy a global audience, maybe? Portion of the story happens in China (with very little plot justification, if at all!) most likely to appeal to one fifth of the world population...I haven't really tried, but is there one, just one stable shot, not movement or zoom or anything, in the entire film?A nearly three hour movie, over a billion dollars worldwide... Well, hundred of millions of spectators can't be wrong: they love avant- garde...",Transformers - Age of Extinction
259,Incendid,165 minutes of Bay...it almost killed me.,3,1 July 2014,"Ciaran: When i sat down in the cinema i knew that the film wasn't going to be anything special, and i didn't expect to see anything good or interesting come from this film. I know some people loved the film, and others are wishing it never happened. So i am going to give my review of Transformers: Age of Extinction. The movie starts in Texas where we meet Mark Whalberg a generic inventor with financial problem, he has a seventeen year old daughter played by Nicola Peltz (Katara from Shyamalan's The Last Airbender)and they have this normal relationship where the father doesn't want her to date, and she just wants him to stop being so obsessed with inventing. Anyway most of the movie focuses on the humans instead of the transformers, and to be honest i didn't care about the humans, and because the focus was on the humans, i didn't care about the transformers, so in turn i didn't care about the movie at all. The acting was just bland from our leads, the only character i actually cared about was Stanley Tucci's and i can't even remember the character's name. T.J Miller was in this movie, and he was sort of the comic relief, but he wasn't funny at all, he even makes a slavery joke. Kelsey Grammar is also in the movie, and his character is just stereotypical,i really couldn't care about him. To summarize the acting in this movie, it was just horrid. The directing, oh god, Bay has to stop with the shaky cam and the dutch camera angles, i mean he just overused them, and the structure of the film is no different to any of the other Transformers films, first act= supposed character development, second act= government conspiracy and robots rolling about the place, then the third act= Micheal Bay's feast of explosions. I think by the second act i was shouting 'get on with it!', this movie was just so long, it had all the depth of a Micheal Bay film and the run time of The Godfather. It really was painful to watch. Anyway onto special effects, and i am going to say, the effects in this film were the worst out of the entire Transformers franchise, i mean even scenes from Age of Dinosaurs looked better. And when they said we were going to get dinobots, i expected to see more than four, and i didn't want to just see them for the last 15 minutes and i didn't want to see them not be used in any way, they were just there to look cool, and even then they didn't. Now the auto-bots, yes, Prime and Bumblebee came back, but the other three, were they just stereotypes? YES. You had the fat commando voiced by John Goodman, you had the Japanese warrior only concerned about honor who was voiced by Ken Wantanabe, and finally the the British robot who only cares for power and showing off. So yeah, they're were stereotypes and it was horrible, this whole movie was just horrible, i really hope that Bay at least tries to make the fifth movie a movie i can watch without being bored into oblivion. So to summarize, Transformers: Age of Extinction was a waste of time, as it is a feast of explosions and robots. I highly recommend you do NOT see this film. Transformers: Age of Extinction is receiving a 4/10 from me.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
260,razzakahmed,A new chapter with a new revolution,7,21 September 2021,"Transformers Age of Extinction. It's completely set in a future where Optimus Prime has been gone for a while and has been wanted, and gets discovered by a new family and this movie well .. in the villains in the first it was Megatron then second it was Megatron and Fallen and the third it was Megatron and Sentinal Prime and the fourth it's like Megatron whose been converted to Galvatron by the people of the earth to use him as a weapon against the autobots and there's Lockdown . So with each movie the graphics get better, the stories get better, the intensity is more appealing, the new cast has done a tremendous job, the movie is very long though, it's two hours forty-five minutes. One thing that really gets me emotional about the Transformers movies, is Optimus Prime's speech, since he's been the main star of all the Transformers movies. The way he builds motivation for his fellow autobots in the end and during the movie is I would say how a true General incharge would do it . He redefines what a heart-touching motivational and inspirational speech is all about . These bots are in fact another living organism after all, another species .. from the planet Cybertron . Their war broke loose on earth so the autobots now defend earth , from those who wish to destroy or rebuild Cybertron. Transformers started from cartoons. Now the gigantic scale of the big screen revolutionizes these epic bodies to another level . Very less cartoons get this kinda honor. But it's all good 🙂",Transformers - Age of Extinction

I watched some really bad movies before, mostly transformers 1-3, but this takes the cake. I was going to stop watching the other transformer movie, when the human girl was a transformer, but i managed to finish it. I stopped watching this one after transformiun or whatever it was called, and galvatron. I will not finish this movie. Not only did bay ruin the name Transformers, he ruin this movie. Just think for 1 moment, humans can control transformium just by mind power and the humans r making glavatron? I never stopped watching a movie before but i can't finish this piece of crap. And Prime was damaged but later scanned a truck and became brand new. WTF!!!!? Why did he need the humans help repair him then? And the Autobots were in hiding? Stay as freaking vehicles and they won't find you. But no, hide out as a giant robot. And finally cuz I wasted enough of my time with this piece of crap, if the aliens or whatever had the weapon to destroy the earth with the dinosaurs, why don't they use it again now. One of the worst and stupidest movies ever. Thank you, Michael Bay. I hope he never does another one.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
262,Loving_Silence,"If you liked the previous Transformers movies, you'll like this.",7,25 June 2014,"Transformers: Age of Extinction is the fourth film of the Transformers franchise, a franchise that's known for being explosive and action- packed and kind of dumb. This film is no exception, it follows the other films like in the exact same regard. But I do think this is an improvement from Dark of the Moon and a BIG improvement from the horrid, Revenge of the Fallen. The film takes a bit more serious approach, but don't get me wrong it still has some stupid humor, just not as much as the previous films, which is pretty refreshing. The action scenes in here are pretty outstanding and it actually has much more wide shots than the previous movies. You can actually see the large scale of these giant robots in breathtaking detail. The visual- effects are fantastic as they usually are with these films, it definitely delivers in that department. However as usual there are numerous problems with the script and story, it's senseless as usual, but not as annoying as ""Revenge of the Fallen"", the dialogue is weak, but at least it's not mindbogglingly stupid. Also the Autobots and even the Decepticons have more of a personality than they used to. Grimlock is a fantastic addition in this film, but I would have liked to have seen a bit more of him. For those who didn't care for Michael Bay's past Transformers films, you probably won't like this because it has even more mindless extravaganza action packed scenes, just like the other films did. However audiences who are game to board the extravagance train will find that Age of Extinction hits all the notes that a Transformers movie ought to. So if you didn't like any of the other past Transformers movies, don't bother watching this cause you'll probably won't become fan after this. If you liked the other ones then you'll most likely be in for a fun ride like I was.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
263,jramza-1,I love the equal mix of 1's and 10's for this movie's reviewers!,4,4 January 2016,"To the point: 1. A very (very) long boring movie about cartoon robots fighting, which tries to introduce serious, quality acting using flat, 2 dimensional, unbelievable characters given a poorly worked out script. It's better than a rating of a 1 (the visuals are beautiful) but no better than a 5 for sure - in any honest review. My advice? See the opening scene with ships, then fast forward to chapter 5. When the bad dialogue and acting start up again (that is, when dad forgets the whole universe is trying to kill him and complains about his 25 year old daughter having a boyfriend), fast forward another 15-20 minutes. Watch it from there, and it really won't be so terrible; you will have cut out a good 50 minutes of the painful footage, and what you're left with is what you came to see: cartoon robots fighting.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Unlike the first Transformers and Transformers Dark Of The Moon, Transformers Age Of Extinction was actually the most disappointing and the worst Transformers movie I've seen. Yeah, Transformers Revenge Of The Fallen was bad but I did like it because... guilty pleasure. The last 3 Transformers movies had more action in it but in Age Of Extinction, you gotta wait for an hour for the real action to start. Not to mention, the movie concentrates more on the humans more than the robots itself. But I find the ending very intriguing. Where Optimus Prime flew out of space and is going to meet his creators (the Quintessons). It made me think that Transformers 5 will now concentrate on the Transformers itself.In conclusion, Transformers Age Of Extinction is such a disappointing movie.

There is way too much down time. The action scenes are boring and i say again unrealistic. The way the autobots changed was so cheesy. The story line was stupid. No explanation on how they went from the previous movie. The plot was dumb. The story made no sense. The plot was completely predictable. I laughed but not at funny parts.

267,nick-sultana,A Better Instalment for the Series,5,29 June 2014,"I know Michael Bay isn't the best film-maker in the movie industry but he can make a lot of money for the production and studio distributors, but I will admit for once that he has made a slight improvement in Age of Extinction. Bringing not only a big CGI-driven action blockbuster but one that has a great cast, enjoyable plot and less to none of what was needed out from the previous films.The plot is set sometime after the climatic events in Dark of the Moon, where both sides of the Transformers are disbanded and hunted down to keep Earth safe and peaceful though the Government does play dirty a little and use What makes it a major better film is the following:* Casting - the cast in AOE is indeed a stand up improvement and all of the cast involved give their best performances. You got greats (Mark Wahlberg, Stanley Tucci, Kelsey Grammar and even the voices of Peter Cullen, John Goodman, John DiMaggio, Ken Watanabe and Frank Welker) and you got the new bunch (Nicola Peltz, Jack Reynor) and among a few others. * Story - The script itself is no Oscar-worthy contender with smart moments, heart and themes but it does keep the audience's attention to the end credits. At least as well there were no plot holes, frequent toilet humour use or even blank characters present. * Pace of the action - As with all of Bay's films there is an massive dose of explosions, gun fights, car chases that overthrows the lacking storyline, but for once I felt that he didn't rush and only kicked in the action when it was needed. I felt it was a better pace than what the badly presented Revenge of the fallen was made out to be.Overall, Age of Extinction is indeed both an entertaining action flick for the Transformers fans and a surprisingly improving sequel/reboot but it is not the best flick of 2014. I'm just as happy of the result Bay and the crew have put into it!

268,StrayFeral,"Boring, boring, except for the actors.",1,7 July 2014,"I love Transformers and everything Transformers, but this movie is an exception. I also never expected to see a boring Michael Bay and Mark Wahlberg movie, but here we are. I even have no words to express how boring this movie was. The writer should be fired.It would be much easier for me to just list what I liked about this movie:Mark Wahlberg (of course) - but I love all Marky movies in general. - Nicola Peltz - this chick looks killing. Nothing else on her from me. - Bingbing Li - I must say she not only looks great, but acts great and does martial scenes great. She's the one which added a lot to the fun element of the movie. - Fun - despite being boring, they put lots of fun elements to the movie, mostly jokes.Most memorable things about this movie:Nicola Peltz's eyes and lips. - Bingbing Li's cuteness, eyes, smile and hair. - The fact that they show there could be like two different new story lines.Worst moment of the movie (***SPOILER ALERT HERE***):The resurrection of Galvatron when he rebels the humanity - we have a robot like two stories high, running around and at some point they show human guards which guard in standing position in the foreground, and the huge robot who just came in the background. At some moment the robot fires a projectile. The guards react like one second later. Why this is worse - we have a huge robot, whose metal heavy steps should echo within the building when he walks, not to speak when he runs, let's add he also roars and finally opens fire. Small explosions should be heard too, not to speak about the other noise. Should be code red and everybody should run around like ants, but no - they are guarding peacefully in tranquillity. Well, who knows - maybe they allow the guards in the super- secret facilities to use MP3 players during shifts, don't they?I can't wait for the next Transformers movie, but please skip this one.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Not a ten either, to be honest, but I just felt the desire to try to do a tiny bit to nudge the overall rating higher.Great music, editing, CG, and a little more story, quite charmingly told. I like Bay's visual style, I think it's unique and very compelling, beautifully lit and warm. Sure, his movies are clunky in parts, but they're just great popcorn fare, so I can't see why he gets such bad reviews, seems unfair!And the transformers in this movie are quite fantastic as well, plus a nice and long bit of storytelling, a real journey.

272,scottjohnson7896,Did We Really Need Another? (Raging Film Review),6,9 August 2014,"Michael Bay realized how much money he was going to be missing out on when he initially claimed that Transformers 3 was going to be his last Transformers. Well, he made a fourth one and it's pretty much what you'd expect. Picking up 4 years after the events of Dark of the Moon, Transformers: Age of Extinction is more of what we've come to expect from Michael Bay and his seemingly endless barrage of robot films. The Transformers are being hunted by a special CIA task force; they are considered threats that need to be reported on sight, and the battle of Chicago has become a sort of rallying call. In lieu of Shia LaBeouf we now have Mark Wahlberg who plays Cade Yeager, a man who has lost his wife and has raised his only daughter (Nicola Peltz) the best he could despite being a failed inventor. He happens upon an old truck in an abandoned movie theater, which turns out to be Optimus Prime. One thing leads to another and we are led on a global adventure, following the Autobots trying to stop an intergalactic bounty hunter as well as trying to stop the production of a line of human-made Transformers, and also dealing with a device that could destroy all life on Earth. If that plot sounds confusing and a little over-excessive, you're right because it is. The film suffers from what the previous films suffered from: a script packed with pointless—and often unfunny—jokes, overly-convoluted plots, gaping plot holes, and horrendous dialogue (""My face is my warrant""). Mark Wahlberg is probably the highlight of the film, but even still he has to struggle along with the awful writing. He brings a more mature main character than LaBeouf did, and this new dynamic helps make it a little more interesting. Other than that, the characters are so poorly written that they seem like generic pawns that only serve to carry the plot forward without adding anything more than a few cringe-worthy lines. Stanley Tucci's character, the eccentric billionaire who owns the company that is producing the new robots, is so painfully written that he is almost a caricature of what an eccentric billionaire should be like. An even bigger example of poor writing is Kelsey Grammar's character who appears to get from place to place without any explanation or consideration of time taken to travel. It's almost like the writers took a page from what the Heroes writers did for TV. When things finally get explosive, there is no stop to them. Though this one felt far more tame than its predecessors, it is actually the longest. The Battle of Chicago in the third film still holds out as the biggest battle, but this one is just a series of small skirmishes in various locations. The combat is still fun, just nowhere near what we have seen before. Even though it's tamer, Bay thought he would balance it out by adding more slow-motion footage. The amount of slow-motion in this film is equivalent to the solar-flares in a JJ Abrams film. Looking back on it, it seemed like despite the huge budget, there wasn't nearly enough concern about the cities of Chicago and Beijing being destroyed. Both cities appear near desolate during the fighting, and we do not even get a glimpse of people being terrified on the streets as huge robots destroy their buildings. The army does not even get involved until a brief glimpse of fighter jets after the final battle of the film. Oh, and did I mention that there are Dinobots? Their inclusion in the final battle saved it from being a complete repeat of what we've seen before. In the end, Transformers: Age of Extinction is exactly what you expect it to be: another mindless action movie from the man who loves explosions and big budgets. It suffers from the same problems that the previous films suffered from, and nobody seems to care about fixing these issues because even as these movies have been getting continuously worse, more and more tickets are being sold. I am not saying this movie is not entertaining, it just simply is not a good movie by the standards of what a movie should be. The film is fun, and that's what we have also come to expect, just don't expect it to be any better than the others.For more reviews, check out ragingfilm.com",Transformers - Age of Extinction
273,jimgigs,Good action but too long,7,18 July 2014,"First off, when you go see a movie like this you have to take it for what it is. What it is is an action packed thrill ride full of car chases and robot fighting, evil government guys, seedy billionaire industrialists, and underdogs saving the day. It's basically the plot of every super hero movie ever made. The storyline is very convoluted, and the 2 hr 45 min running time was at least 45 mins to long. There was also a bunch of unnecessary cussing that turned me off. However I did enjoy the movie, and mark wahlberg I thought played his part really well, as did stanley tucci and Kelsey grammar.

Who were or is the Editor????? This movie was way too long, too many plots and much poor casting...Marky Mark needs to go back to rapping. I never thought he was a good actor any way. His daughter in the movie looks like his girlfriend, they look totally awkward. The script is just awful....so predictable and corny. You could anticipate where that plot was going and the script before it was even spoken.Again I think Hollywood or is it Michael Bay thinks movie goers just like the effects and I do and they were absolutely stunning in this movie...but I found myself nodding from boredom...it was just wayyyyy too long and the characters were more like caricatures...I couldn't tell when the action started who was good and who was a bad transformer after a while, everything was a ball of metal confusion.Seeing such a good actor Tucci in such a dumb role is disheartening...but its all about money, isn't it?...no matter what role you take, you will get a piece of the $93 million dollar pot and that was the first weekend alone or something close to that amount.Sometimes you need to leave a good thing alone (The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, Amityville Horror, Transformers, etc).

It was a never ending cliché throughout the movie and I had doubts about the characters (and the writers) intelligence on several occasions. . I am also not a fan of the shaky cam style used throughout the show. When it's shaky and moving that fast I feel like important details get missed. I also felt like this was a way to long commercial with explosions, bad script, and directing. We saw beats by Dre, Oreos, Samsung, Budweiser, gm cars, Goodyear, and that was just the ones off the top of my head. Each product placement scene was so terribly obvious it was painful.

276,michael-sengwah,Still Fun Enough,7,28 June 2014,"The 4th entry of the Transformers series has ventured into a fantasy adventure with completely different cast, different style and different tone but Michael Bay proves that he does not really need a superior Oscar level story to maintain his robotic franchise as an entertaining popcorn flick. While the destruction is not as big as in Dark of the Moon, adding more retro style fighting scenes between Transformers would definitely fulfill the fan base but they might be a bit upset due to the limited appearance of the cool Dinobots and Galvatron. Of course, being the first to be filmed in IMAX 3D cameras, Bay has guaranteed a sophisticated visual stunning experience to the audiences. Kruger's script might be a little bit of overlong with some usual unnecessary scenes but it is glad to see that the overall tone of the film appears to be more serious. Mark Wahlberg﻿ and Stanley Tucci performed well together with the robots, Kelsey Grammar is perfectly made up for the villain; but Jack Reynor and Nicola Peltz lost their chemistry with Wahlberg. The scores, composed by both Hans Zimmer and Steve Jablonsky, as well as music from Imagine Dragon have changed as well, but it is still powerful and explosive just as the film. Overall, audiences would just need a relaxing mind to enjoy this summer blockbusters which is totally full of fun without needing to squeeze their mind until the ending.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
277,isaiahwilson15,The transformers make a worthy comeback,7,22 December 2014,"Despite the reviews of both the critics as well as the fans, I can not help but think this movie is a step in the right direction for the transformers series. Transformers Age of Extinction is a good transformers film because it incorporates a key element that lacked in the second and third films, a good villain. Lockdown is a nice, developed villain that was given personality and a meaningful purpose. However, this can not be said about the supporting autobots. Probably the two worst factors in this film are the supporting human characters and the other autobots. Stanley Tucci and Mark Wahlberg are the only two actors in this movie that give good performances, they are also the only two humans that anyone cares about in the movie. All the other humans seem to serve absolutely no purpose, or a purpose that no one cares about. The supporting autobots also prove to be very weak. Aside from Bumblebee, who has made appearances in all four movies, the other autobots suffer from a lack of personality and are almost meaningless (Including the Dinobots). Overall the story and the villain are the two very strong points in this movie, and the two elements I value most in any film.

280,simonkie,Great story,7,11 March 2015,This film is very long and that seems to be the main criticism of the film. It does start of a bit slow but that's what makes it good. It has everything all the other films had except Shia Labeouf which may be another criticism of the film although Mark Whalberg does a great job but doesn't have that innocence and fear that Labeouf displayed. So what ever happened to all those dead Decepticons and Autobots after the big battle in the last movie? You now have humans making their own transformers while hunting down any remaining transformers who are in hiding including the Autobots. Length aside the story is very good and the action and special effects are amazing. The introduction of the Dinobots was awesome. If you can get through the first 30 min which is slow the movie picks up in a big way. As usual Micheal Bay leaves a visual treat for the eyes.

For me, this is the last Michael Bay film I will ever watch, whether it be in the theater, on DVD or on cable.

All are present in the movie. If you go see it keeping those things in mind, you may even enjoy it a little bit.

I will say that hearing Optimus Prime threatening to kill someone every 5 minutes was a little jarring. Not because they didn't deserve it or because I'm a pacifist, but because it is totally out of character. Also, the animation for the ""new"" transformers transforming process is not good... First, the animation is glitchy sometimes. Second, it is more like ""magic happens"" then getting to watch a vehicle morph into a robot. It just is not appealing.

I ""love"" how the movie sometimes slows down and plays some sad music to try to make you care for stereo type characters who you don't care about at all. The story is so predictable it falls flat even for a summer popcorn movie. You can guess what will happen in the next scene. I actually can not describe how dumb, over used, boring, lazy, hair rippingly bad the hole movie is.the cgi is pretty i guess, though nothing which we have not seen before, and as the film progress you just start to feel more and more sick of the explosions and people outrunning fire and falling crap. Yes there are dinobots in it. at the last like 20 minutes. And they basically just run around in random explosions even if you hyped about dinobots the more than 2 hours to get there dose not worth it.Avoid it! Avoid it at all cost!

This fourth instalment in the mostly unfavourable film franchise inspired from the Hasbro toy line has taken risks and has improved over its careless and agonising stupidity that took over the last three movies.Transformers: Age of Extinction is a standalone spectacle on mostly every level that the franchise can take. There's no more goofiness and unnecessary dialogue, there's just one clean line of perfection. As fans may know this is the start of a second trilogy of films. This time there's no wimpy Shia LaBeouf as the lead role, instead Mark Wahlberg takes his place as an engineer named Cade Yeager who lives in Texas countryside with his daughter, Tessa (Nicola Peltz).To get people on the right track, this takes place four years after the rather disappointing Dark of the Moon. It's climax, referred to as the Battle of Chicago, makes big changes in store for the Autobots. Humans are hunting them down and killing them all off. Meanwhile, Cade buys a wrecked truck which turns out to be Optimus Prime, the leader of the Autobots. Now they must join him as they are targeted by the government and a new villain, Lockdown. It's kind of a good thing that Optimus has chosen different people to come and help him. You kind of got fed up with LaBeouf's constant moaning that ruined the last film. The humans are more mature in this film. That's what I've liked to see.It's partially a reboot and a sequel mixed together but with just one urban plot hole: what happened to the previous characters? Four years later and they just disappear without any explanation. Even Cade in the film doesn't ask Bumblebee the simple question: who and what happened to your last owner? There has to be an answer. They can't just GO! The film offers everything in the Transformers canon that you could ask for. There are car chases, bike chases, sky chases and overall, timeless typical action scenes. Some run for like 10-15 minutes or so, especially the big chunk at the end. They're more explosive and bigger than ever. But when the Dinobots (who are the Transformers that were going to appear in the very first film but Bay decided not to use them, after two movies he decides to bring them in for some strange reason) roll in, that's when it all really goes crazy. They have potential screen time but they have no real characterisations while on screen (not in their plot points). All they mainly do is just stomp around and barge into things like mad.One of the things Bay has fixed is the humour. It's actually funny compared to the worthless, cheesy comedy last time round. There's one moment when a ship (with Cade in it) crash-lands onto a car and the person in the car asks him for insurance. Ehren Kruger's script is fresh and has got less clichés than the last two movies but has too much of a plot. There didn't need to put so much into it. With Dark of the Moon's plot, that was enough. This just crosses the line.The biggest problem with AOE is that it's too long. Bay promised it would be shorter than DOTM (Dark of the Moon) but instead he lies, again. It turns out to be exhaustively 165 minutes long, the longest one yet, eleven minutes longer than DOTM. It would have been better if it was shorter. It takes the first 40 minutes to get the actual thing going. In those forty minutes, there's nothing but human communication. The film drags a bit in places.The 3D: it's the best experience I've had since Gravity. Whether you see it in 3D or IMAX 3D, the viewing is extraordinary. But it's a tough choice for people who can't survive wearing the glasses for nearly three hours. I couldn't bare it for that long, especially with how eye-popping the effect was. Probably the best 3D film of the year so far.The acting – well I'm not sure there's loads of it but I wonder whether sometimes the actors just act as themselves, not with their characterisations. Especially Wahlberg, you sometimes wonder that he's actually doing that. Or as he always done that in his films? Even Stanley Tucci, who plays Joshua Joyce, the head of the company KSI who creates a new technology based on the Transformers. Most of the time he plays his character but whenever he gets angry and shouts it feels like he's playing himself.The thing I miss about the Transformers franchise is the originated relationships between the robots and the humans. In this one, neither there's a particular friendly relationship between them unlike the previous movies. The humans just follow and help the Autobots around and don't have a moment or two to get to know each other in a friendly way. In the previous trilogy, Shia LaBeouf's character, Sam Witwicky, had a relationship with Bumblebee because he was his car. Here, Bumblebee is more involved in the mission and has no time for talk. Prime is more involved in that process this time.Despite a few little wobbles (even including the worst ending yet when, without giving away too much, the Dinobots head off unexpectedly), this is the best, biggest, craziest, funniest, calmest, most enjoyable, explosive and exciting & action-packed instalment yet. This indeed is the Transformers movie we've been waiting for.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
288,Rage-Kage,Not as bad as people say,8,29 June 2014,I want to start this review by saying that I liked this movie as well as the other Transnformers movies which of course means that this review will be universally hated by all who see it. I will really never understand all of the hate for these movie. The internet will tell you that these movies are universally hated but a billion dollar franchise does not add up to universal hate no matter how much the haters would like you to believe that it does. I'm not saying that these movies are great but they are not as bad as people say. Now that that little rant is out of the way I'll move onto the movie itself.Transformers Age of Extinction's plot revolves around Mark Wahlberg his daughter and her boyfriend trying to clear there names after corrupt CIA agents basically ruin their lives. At the same time the autobots reluctantly decide to help the humans once again despite the fact that the humans have been hunting and killing them. So there is a lot going on in this movie and for the most part I enjoyed watching it play out. Mark Wahlberg is SO MUCH better than Shia LaBeouf and Stanley Tucci is much better than John Turturro but I hate how Micheal Bay tried to make the 2 actors the exact same character. Luckily Stanley Tucci is so awesome overall as an actor he manages to do really well with his roll. Seeing as how it's a Transformers movie the action was of course a lot of fun to look at the dialog was cheesy and some characters were pretty useless but it is still overall a fun and entertaining movie. There are a few moments throughout the movie where the special effects were less than great but it was the same with all three of the other movies so for me those few moments are not that big of a deal.If IMDb would let me I would give Transformers Age of Extinction a 7.5/10,Transformers - Age of Extinction
289,chriscarlisle25,Just full of clichés,4,8 July 2014,"(spoiler at the end) This movie is so full of clichés, I started to wonder what in the world I was even watching. I just wanted to get up and leave, probably should have because it wasted 3 hours of my life. The movie spends half of the movie trying to develop lame characters trying their best to make the audience laugh (didn't work). This movie did not have that much action in it, lame dialogue, mark Wahlberg trying his best to be a serious actor, characters trying to be funny, lame plot, and just irritating people throughout. I was happy when it ended, I was the first one out of the theater. I do have to say that I liked the graphics and great geological aspects of the movie though. The cinematography was pretty good too, they picked some pretty good locations to film. *spoiler* Why couldn't octimus prime just fly over to the fight instead of riding a dinobot, just to look cool?",Transformers - Age of Extinction
290,TheMovieVlog,The graphics and animation were improved. Not a great story line but its a must see.,7,27 June 2014,"Another case of critics vs the average movie goer. I'm not Bay fan, but for once I felt he got the formula finally balanced. A reduction of childish attempts at humor, a more serious story, on screen character development of both human and robot characters, TIME to let the plot develop, good use of 3D and CGI, and good action both from humans and robots. Of all the Transformers movies, this is definitely the best for all the reasons it should be. A good sci-fi movie with characters that you can finally believe exist in the same world and far less annoying human actors. The movie is a right mix of comedy / humans and bot on bot action. If you are a fan of the Transformer series you will love all the nuggets and nods to the past. If you are a casual fan and only have seen the other three then you might not understand all the little sub plots.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
291,mgitts1977,Don't pay attention to the bad reviews see it for yourself!,9,13 July 2014,"I thought that this was one of the better sequels. It had me on the edge of my seat in the theater. The action was intense and fast paced, as to be expected in any Michael Bay film. Don't watch it expecting it to be like the others, because for obvious reasons, the story must progress. It was full of action, different transformers, different tech and the characters were well portrayed. It was also great that more from the cartoon was incorporated into this movie. Casting was excellent because it was very refreshing to see new faces bringing something different to the franchise. I'll probably go and see it again! Give it a chance. Take it for what it is, entertainment, and enjoy the show!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
292,treymoncrieff-29917,They're losing it,5,8 February 2021,I enjoyed the first three but this one is bit of a downhill. They were losing what they were good at. So yeah.,Transformers - Age of Extinction
293,jonruff108,I was shocked at how terrible this movie was,3,8 November 2014,"Oh boy...where to start... Save $10 and 2 hour and 40 minutes of your time. The soundtrack was good and the cinematography was cool but this is one of the most poorly made movies I've ever seen. I was dumbfounded at how boring it was. I nearly fell asleep in the theater. The run time was absolutely atrocious. At nearly three hours it felt more like four. There was at least three different times I thought I had seen the climax only to discover the movie wasn't even near being over.I came to this movie expecting some cool CGI and action scenes. Instead I got boring characters talking about ""important stuff"" and terrible CGI robots fighting each other. The animation is seriously pathetic in this movie. Transformers 1 looked better than this. But, bad CGI and acting aside, the plot holes and dullness in the story was pathetic and make this movie and utter waste of time.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
294,bdawe14,Boring,3,31 July 2014,"Well it's that time of year again when we all get to go out and watch the summer blockbusters and they've managed to do in this film exactly what they did in the others its a 2.5hr movie with a 15 min fight at the end stretched over 45-55 mins. It's so dull I got totally bored watching it, it just turned into the fight that would never end. They clearly have been given big cgi budgets from the studio and boy do they mean to use all of it just like the other transformers movies this means that you have to sit through 1 long fight for a hour at the end of the movie which does nothing to push the mediocre plot forward. I can only assume the producers have shares in the companies that do all the cgi. Just like the others you could cut 45 mins of meaningless crap out of the end of this movie and lose nothing not that there's a lot to lose all of these transformers movies have paled in comparison to the story telling and plot lines in the cartoons they such dull movies they should change the names to transformers 1-4 when cgi goes bad and issue you with a sleeping pill when you enter the movie theatre then again them movie is more than dull enough to fulfil that task. If you've seen any of the others skip it you've seen it already.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
295,jacob-m-ford97,Transformers: Age of Extinction review,6,1 July 2014,"This is the fourth installment of the Transformers films, and let me assure you that it is just as loud as the previous three. In this episode we find a completely new set of characters, solely because the previous actors refused to return. The film begins with Texan inventor Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) collecting thrown out metals and other garbage as he tries to create his million dollar idea in order to put his daughter through college. (Unfortunately his ""million dollar idea"" is a robot that will paint walls with a roller, so this is fairly unsuccessful. At least the robot had eyes!) The irrelevant storyline given to us this time around is a corrupt CIA official hunting down all the remaining autobots in order to obtain their parts to manufacture the ultimate weapon. Meanwhile Cade Yeager stumbles upon a truck which turns out to be Optimus Prime and we have our innocent human caught in the mix. But no one cares about the story anyway, we're just here to see the explosions.As previously mentioned, Mark Wahlberg leads the cast of characters in this film. His performance was extremely dull and rehearsed, but his biceps were very large, and that's all that really mattered with this story. Nicola Peltz played the main female model -- excuse me, character, in this episode and let me just say that I never thought I'd be asking for Megan Fox to come back. Fox was hardly an actor in the first two films, but her character had at least some sort of personality to it. Peltz gave her role as Wahlberg's daughter zero character and it was honestly uncomfortable every time she appeared on screen. The only actor who was able to find any sort of traction in this film was Stanley Tucci. Playing inventor/businessman Joshua Joyce, Tucci at some point realized there was no point in trying to give a quality performance in this film, so his solution to that was to go crazy. Doing entirely unreasonable actions and laughter and ad-libbing ridiculous lines throughout, Tucci provided me with many laughs. Also cast in the film were Kelsey Grammar as the corrupt CIA official, T.J. Miller as the irritating sidekick, Jack Reynor as the guy Nicola Peltz kisses at the end of the movie, and John Goodman, Ken Watanabe, Robert Foxworth, and Peter Cullen lending their voices to play the autobots.Sadly, Michael Bay returned once again to direct Transformers 4, with Michael Kruger penning the script and the many visual effects artists making the movie. Bay did what he always does, providing just enough story so that he can fit in as many loud explosions and attractive women as he can. Sometimes I wonder if Bay cares at all about the final result of his films. In this specific film the story goes nowhere, the brief synopsis I provided is about as far as it reaches, and the continuity issues are countless. Had Bay or the editors paid attention to the order of things, Optimus Prime would have been dead five minutes into the movie. And finally, this is something I usually try to avoid from bothering me, but this movie was much too long. It wasn't quite three hours, but with as little story as there was I was having to readjust in my seat more times than I can remember. About two hours in I remember watching one of the long drawn out battles and thinking that this was the climactic final battle. That's when I realized that I hadn't even seen one of the Dinosaur Transformers that they had boasted so much about in advertisement. It's probably pretty clear that I didn't like this movie very much. With as many great films as I've seen already this summer, this was a huge disappointment. I've always slightly enjoyed watching the Transformers films for the sake of seeing the giant robots fighting each other and the fact that the visual effects creators are so good at making that, and I was looking forward to this as I entered the theater. However, this movie seriously turned me off, and as I left the theater I was glad to be doing so. I give ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" a 5.8/10.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
296,RemusGrey,"I was impressed by the first time seeing this, but not anymore for the second time.",4,27 May 2015,"This was one of my most anticipated movies of 2014. Because of so much anticipation, I enjoyed this movie when I first saw it. When I was going to see it for a second time, I finally realized that the plot was too long making the movie 165 minutes! It didn't even have a story at all. All there are in the movie are just a lot of loud noises, explosions, destructions, invasions, and long battles that takes place in so many places. Sure, the effects and Optimus Primes riding his T-Rex Dinobot was cool, but that cannot be a reason to say the movie was great. The real focus of the film is the millions of tons of computer-generated debris. That's all. All things where my thumbs are up are on Mark Wahlberg and Stanley Tucci's performances, the soundtrack and ""Battle Cry"" song, and the effects. But get ready for my thumbs pointing down on almost everything except the good things I listed. Michael Bay's movies never changes and apologizes to us. It just continues being awful. I liked the first and third Transformer movies. The second one was fine. This one was bad. And the punishment of the audience and critics are hates on this movie. I'm sure Michael Bay wouldn't direct the fifth movie because of hates. And I'm sure the fifth one would be the Transformers movie apology. Don't watch this.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
297,nightstalker-7,Are You all 1-4 stars running on meth?,9,1 October 2014,"Greetings. I cannot believe it. I was so afraid to see Transformers AoE, because of You. People, who write dull reviews, that are totally irrelevant and shallow. I think that most of You haven't seen even traielr for first three prequels, nor the movies themselves.Transformers were ALWAYS about big-bada-boom bad-ass action. There was never any story, nothing. It was always effects, effects, effects, heroism, even though it was always naive, it's awesome.I don't know how so many of You could possibly not like Transformers. You should probably stick with movies like the one I forget the name of for my own safety, where devil raped some guy, it was a comedy and had about 7-7,5 on IMDb. You should stick to such movies, because that was state of absolute and utter stupidity.I really enjoyed the movie. Story was linear, the same as was in first, second and yes, even in third prequel. Effects were awesome, musical score was a bit weaker, but everything else was splendid. I enjoyed funny things main actors told, it was a little long, but whatever, it was a lot of good action.I bet people who gave it 1-4 stars love movies like The Raid, or The Raid Redemption, which are really, really, really bad, and play to be action movies, but never even achieve the TV quality.Shame on You who rate AoE so poorly, if You don't like Transformers at all, don't watch them, no one forces You, or if find prequels different from AoE, You should go see an ophthalmologist, or wait for Your period till it's over.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
298,Victreebong,Meh.,6,29 June 2014,"I really want them to go back to the first movie and just really look at what worked so well. That was the hallmark of this franchise.Trans4mers (why didn't they call it this?) is not bad, but it isn't great either. The beginning actually starts off good, believable even. It's dark and pretty sad if you are one of the 3 people in the US who now who the individual robots are. We get two new lead males, a brand new hottie to ogle, and several new cliché agents who nonetheless are good casting choices. I miss Labeouf, but I will easily welcome Wahlberg because his shtick works really well in this movie. They threw the characters a curve ball this time and instead of male fan-boy service, the ladies get the fan-girl service this time, sort of. Jack Reynor may not be everyone's dreamboat, but his role is the standard malaise of current American culture. Older reckless, fatherless dude sleeps with naïve underage girl. Single parent dad gets involved. Is there any other way? Speaking of which, Nicole Peltz is no Megan Fox. Neither blonde has been able to fill Fox's shoes. You can argue over whether Fox is a good actress, or not. The fact is she became a sex symbol INSTANTLY for an entire generation of young men thanks to that pivotal role. Peltz, may go down as Miss North Dakota.Anyways, the movie starts of sad, builds steam by the time we meet Tucci's character, the CEO of a burgeoning empire KCI who has ties with a Black Op's faction of the government heralded by Kelsey Grammar's character, called Cemetery Wind. Mild spoilers ahead... They are on the verge of creating their own Autobots and taking everything back to zero with the aid of a third external force, another sentient robot alien known as Lockdown. At this point the plot becomes messy, and here's where everyone is complaining. Bay simply took on way to much without resolving much in this movie. The entire cast finds themselves abducted, fleeing, or fighting in odd scenarios away from where everything started out in Texas. We are yet again tossed into Bay's scrambled sense of geography and logistics. We saw this problem in the first movie and it has continued on since. (How can you be in Nevada from D.C. after just leaving Afghanistan, all in the same day by helicopter?!) In this entry, we go from Texas, to New York(?), to Beijing, to Shanghai, in hours!! Oh yeah, because of bounty hunter space ships! Lockdown is a headhunter working for a greater force in the Transformers Universe sent down to get prime. All of this is because, in exchange for Optimus Prime's bounty, a ""seed"" will be exchanged that holds the key to obtaining more Tranformium, the material responsible for Transformers... transforming. So yeah, already there's nearly 5 different parties involved in this plot, and it gets even harrier when Grimlock and co get shoehorned in.The result is a movie that's not so much a hot mess as it is a spectacle with nothing to answer for. The movie has the same issues that Prometheus had two years ago in that it gives you a lot to handle, but nothing to understand. Not only that, several big bads were seriously downplayed this time around and some shouldn't have even been revealed! Did anybody know that John Goodman's voice was the character Hound from the cartoon? Or Ken Watanabe's voice-over character was Drift? The characters were never even introduced properly. And what happened to Arcee? She never got any proper screen time in the last happenings, and already they've axed her character with no explanation. Was she expunged by Cemetery Wind? What about Sideswipe and Dino? They made it to the end last time. For that matter, we yet again get more random sights of the Transformers with no real interaction of the Transformers, with the exception of Optimus Prime. Instead the human characters play out all drama and dialog. This is a film about Transformers. As much as we like dogs and comic relief, please make the movies more about the Transformers. If they did this with TMNT, the movie or show or whatever would instantly flop. Transformers may have a larger cast to choose from, but aside from Starscream, Bumblebee, Optimus Prime, and Megatron, we really don't get to know anything unique about the Autobots or the Decepticons.The action yet again is just unreal! If you want to see both people and CGI machines fly through buildings then this is your popcorn flick of the year. Where the movie fails at keeping things controlled, it excels at chaos. Loud noises, beautiful landscapes and cityscapes, hot girls, loud explosions, Explosions, EXPLOSIONS. Bay has once again put a premise on action and spectacle. The good new is there's far less military posters. The bad news is Bud Light and Victoria's Secret could not be more blatantly flaunted in your face.Age of Extinction will be a notch above RotF, but not as good as Dark of the Moon, and sadly I don't think we'll have another Bay entry that blows us away as much as Transformers (2007) first did. Since the movie is already well over 100 million just in the US as of writing this, it's safe to say a Transformers 5 is in the works. Will Bay continue his series that he promised to end three years ago? The Transformers franchise may be close to becoming as undead as a cinema franchise can hope to be.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
299,sastorytellerfilms,"Great movie, Amazing, Exciting, However.....",8,1 July 2014,I would have given transformers 4 10 stars however I agree with fans being a fan myself that Bay does need to be very careful where he takes this. Personally I loved the movie however the character changes do worry me. And why in the h*ll did they not use Frank Welker for Megatron to begin with? This makes Bay look like a bad producer especially how awesome the voice works for Galvatron. The autobots are very cool. Loved John Goodman voicing hound. Killing off Ratchet in my opinion is as sacrilegious as killing off Ironhide in part 3. Bay is a great action director but I ask what is wrong with this man and his ego? The more Ninja Turtles trailers I see the more it looks like an effects party spin off of transformers 4. Of course I will go see it but Bay is beginning to cross too many lines of breaking rules from classic story lines. I will boycott watching these movies if they get even farther away in part 5 and if they don't make a part 5 and leave everything open I'm done with Bay to be honest. I loved his first TF1 and TF2 movie but Bay has really stepped out on a selfish ego trip to throw in the dinobots the way he did. They were awesome and yes I was entertained beyond words but after the excitement dying down I can honestly say they cheated us on story and characters folks. Loved Mark in this and I hope they keep him. They could have snipped a half hour off the film by just leaving his daughter's boyfriend and their relationship out of the movie and nobody would have cared about it. Overall if you've never seen the cartoon then this review won't make sense so just disregard all of this. Watch the cartoon and come back and you'll agree we are being ripped off by big budget effects and it makes me sad Steven Spielberg didn't control more of what Bay did to honor the timeless characters we grew up with. Entertaining but not a great movie like it could have been. Certainly amazing but not epic. ~ S A Storyteller,Transformers - Age of Extinction
300,Ali-hamza-re,Garbage,2,27 September 2014,This film is totally garbage. this is the worst transformer film in the the series and if you think the the all three parts suck then it beat them all. the visually effect in this film at some point was cheap and the acting one of the worst and the script hahahaha Hilarious. if you are little smart and read any novel then you watch this film you know that this film is garbage. The Dialogue of this film is worst and i have never seen a film which this much worst dialogue. Ehren Kruger write this film and i advice you never watch is film he is the worst writer and he should be forbid to write any film and the transformer look so garbage and i do not know why so much people watch this film and gross more than 1 billion dollar never watch any transformer and the 5th part surely be also the worst. this film is so painful when you watch it never see any transformer.,Transformers - Age of Extinction
301,TanQ,"Giant, fighting robots fight for something or other",7,21 March 2015,"Okay, let me say I thought the first movie was utterly stupid, robots fighting each other for a big cube that could transform into a smaller cube, and the second one was so incomprehensible that I'm still not sure what it was about. I gave the third one a pass but the fourth one, well, I saw it on Netflix and gave it a shot. Considering this is a movie based on a cartoon based on a toy, I found it to be strangely compelling - the best out of the four. I know the names of three of the robots, the rest of them just seemed to named something-bot or whatever-Tron. It doesn't really matter, no one should care that much to bother remembering anyone's names in this crashfest.I found if you just ignore everything the robots said, this movie worked just as well as Prometheus. The humans were better. It features Dad, bimbo, himbo and Steve Jobs fighting against evil CIA guy and his boss, Evil Frasier. Most of what they say is actually not too badly written considering the film is just an epic battle scene. I still find the discrepancy between the size of the big robots compared to their vehicle disguises to be troubling, I guess it has something to do with the Cube of Efficient Packing. And the fact that the humans are constantly grabbed by what amounts to a whole lot of pinch points is almost forgettable this time around. None of that takes away from what we're really here to see - Hong Kong getting trashed. The movie is long, so long that they had to throw in a flashback about two hours in so you can be reminded about what the film is actually about. Fast forward through that, you won't really care. What you really want to see is a giant, fighting robot wielding a sword and riding a giant, robot dinosaur. Thank you, Michael Bay.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Why? isn't it supposed to be about the transformers? this was almost like a war movie but with robots, boring really boring. MR Bay should retire if he keeps continuing doing crap like this: When are you gonna do a transformer movie and one with a decent story? Are you really proud over this? or are you just laughing all the way to the bank? the Voice overs where terrible, don't hire those guys again, and why this extremely boring sense of humor your trying to sneak in these movies? its not funny, learn for god sake.This time you hardly got to know who was fighting ( which autobots ) against who.

303,jukangliwayway,"this is not a film, it's an over-sized boy's overindulgent wet dream",4,4 July 2014,"Sometimes, I think Michael Bay is really just a teenage boy on crack who is obsessed with his robots & cars & explosions - like a kid playing with his toys & bumping them against each other and not caring about anything else. Because that's evident yet again in his recent blockbuster movie, a term that I will grudgingly use in this post. It's not a movie, it's more like an extended video of metal clashing against metal & mind-numbing explosions, and product placements here & there - this is not a film, it's an over-sized boy's overindulgent wet dream.Now, now, I don't hate this film - even if it's really stupid & loud & everything seems to be irritating. To be fair, Mark Wahlberg & Stanley Tucci made this one bearable, and some times fun. The daughter, boyfriend, & goofy friend on the other hand are incredibly stupid. And I definitely prefer this than that awful third installment. No, I don't hate it. Because the graphics are really awesome, the autobots are cute, & like I've said, Wahlberg & Tucci's charisma won me over. But that's about it, aside from those I've mentioned - this is a pretty shallow & forgettable film. First of all, for a movie with no seemingly cohesive plot/script, T:AofE is pretty darn long! I kept on looking at my watch and wonder when the hell will the movie end? I get that Bay caters to people who love these robots & explosions & action, but Jesus H. Christ this guy doesn't know the meaning of subtlety! Granted that the CGI is amazing, in my opinion, and the robots are slick & mesmerizing, but the thing is, when they clash and wreck things, all becomes a blur that you won't even care what the hell is happening, not to mention the fact that since the characters aren't fully fleshed out - so whatever is going on in the screen, my reaction most of the time is a nonchalant ""eh?"" and an occasional ""meh"". There's too much of everything that the only feeling I've had halfway through is ""jaded."" You know you're looking at something attractive, but your brain becomes muddled as if it has short-circuited because of the garbage that it's trying to process, so half of the time you just sit there, munching on some overpriced popcorn, wondering if seeing this mind-numbing mess of a movie really worth it? Then again you can't think because your brain is temporarily fried.Who cares about plot & characterization? This is an action movie about robots and that's all that matters! Note that that's the usual argument of Transformers' fans and while they may have a point, however superficial, of course it's ultimately flawed. To all the fanboys out there who accuse critics of being a bunch of arrogant pseudo-intellectuals for wanting something more than bangs & booms, be a little more open-minded and see the view from the other side. Is it really wrong to want something more than clichéd characters/plot, cheesy dialogue, & shaky action (because I admit that during scenes where Bay just goes crazy & just puts every robots, ammos, grenades, & cars he has altogether - it all becomes a mess)? After all, we all paid for tickets. But then again, by this time you already know how Michael Bay works & how much fudge he doesn't give, so seriously, this is a losing battle. I say, critics, back the hell off because no matter what you say you won't win this war. And that's quite obvious.... After 4 blockbuster Transformers movies.Let's face it, this franchise is nowhere near extinction and we will still be on the lookout for Transformers 5 despite the spider sense ringing inside our heads warning us to stay the hell away from it. Maybe that's Michael Bay's real (and only?) talent, that is, to successfully lure us into his trap with colorfully-wrapped candies - which if you think about it - too much will give you diabetes. Here's a nice thought to end this review: Wouldn't it be intriguing to see someone else direct Transformers, to maybe prevent us from having gangrene?READ MY FULL REVIEW ON BLOGSPOT: strangereview.blogspot.com/2014/07/transformers-age-of-extinction- 2014.html#comments",Transformers - Age of Extinction
304,somlaign1,Butchered the Transformers brand,4,2 July 2014,"I wanted to like this movie since I'm a fan of Transformers. This is totally different and remote from its 3 prequels, and not in a good way. The third Transformers was a little disappointing but this was way worse. The beginning was slow, boring, and pointless. The human characters had absolutely no personalities or emotions--the robots probably had more emotions than the humans. I did not feel the connection between the human and robot aliens because the acting was so bad. The only good thing about this was the CGI but like what most have said, by that time you really don't care about what's going on. I am giving this 4 stars only because I still like the Transformers brand.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
305,theflixerdotcom,"It's not x-men, but neither is the source material",9,9 July 2014,"I just can't understand what people are expecting when they go to the theatre to watch a movie about giant alien robots that transform into vehicles where the source material is a cheesy cartoon from the 80's..People, give your head a shake...This movie is everything it can be and probably much more. We don't have 50 years of dramatic comic book material for source like the Avengers, X-Men, or any of the DC or Marvel properties (to which I assume this is compared). What we have is watered down cartoons made for small children, and 80's nostalgia.That said, Michael Bay is perfect for bringing the spirit of what Transformers are to the big screen. Loud, destructive, and ridiculous. When I bought my ticket, this is what I expected and this is most certainly what I got....going right back to the first film.This movie was on a much larger scale than the previous entries and I thought Whalberg was a great replacement for Labouf as the hyperactive lead. Labouf was a little too intense for me in the 3rd movie (he may have gone a little loopy by that time) where Whalberg seems to bring it back down to a more sane level as in Labouf in Transformers 1.So I raise a glass to Mr. Bay, and I (and millions of others I'm sure) salute you and your fantastically loud and ridiculous transforming robot alien masterpiece! Keep them coming!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
306,alexandregatineau,Embarrasing to watch,4,14 June 2018,"Yes, we know Transformers movies aren't great, but even as someone who can appreciate 1 and 2, this number 4 is just horrible.
You'd think Bay would listen a bit to what people have to say about the first 3 movies and take that into account but no. Or maybe he did and somehow managed to enhance everything that was wrong with the previous movies and crank it into one movie. 
The most generic actors you can get (yes, even you poor Mark, Texan overprotective father), the CGI isn't as good as it used to be, probably because they're trying too hard to make original looking stuff. And remember Sam's parents being embarrassing for 5 minutes? Well, in this movie, the Mark manages to be embarrassing through the entire movie. You want to see a father tell his super hot 17 years old daughter she can't have a boyfriend, in the middle of a fight for their lives? Yep, that's how low it sinks. Do yourself a favor and skip this, and if you really need to watch robots punch each other, go watch Transformers 1 or Pacific Rim.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
307,baquaman,underrated,8,11 June 2021,Probably the best Michael Bay transformers movie. Maybe the movie is too long but it's definitely a must watch. It's predictable but still a very fun watch. Excellent action scenes and visual effects.,Transformers - Age of Extinction
308,tariq-hossenbux,Cacophony of Explosions and Little Else,3,17 November 2014,"As the title of my review suggests, besides explosions and CGI this film contains little of any other redeeming elements of film making. At a running time approaching 3 hours, it's just too much time spent watching CGI robots tumbling, blasting, and blowing things up. With such a simple plot line and shallow characters who don't meaningfully engage each other or the audience, this film should be 1.5 hours at the most. In the beginning I was hopeful that Wahlberg's fine acting skills could save it, but it was not enough and I do not blame him for the poor script. You will likely feel more of a connection with Optimus Prime than any of the humans, which is quite sad I think. Michael Bay makes an attempt in Transformers to warn us of the dangers of giving drones too much autonomy, but it is confusedly wandering in between explosions and often difficult to spot. Even for a movie about giants robots battling each other, I found the CGI movement to be non believable and that further disengaged me. On a large screen some may enjoy the panoramic views and Bay hallmark spectacular destruction but if you want anything more than that see something else.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
309,submitme,Simply though to go through,3,15 July 2018,"The first bit of the movie were ""so-so"", but I could maybe, maybe buy into that. Even though I thought it were already a bit over the top and incoherent with the story.But very soon, everything goes sideways. There is generally no storyline, no actual plot. The dialogue in the movie is very poor and has no real depth to it. In the previous Transformer movies, they have managed to also have some fun dialogue, but if they are in this movie, I totally missed them.The movie tries to save itself with alot of action, but sadly its not very good or memorable. And the particleeffects looks aweful and poorly implementet.
Also the movie is packed with product-placement, I don't mind some product placement, as it can make a movie look more ""real-world"". But here it's over the top and only an attempt to finance a bad movie, from an otherwise good franchise.The last 1½ hour or so, were nothing but action, but without coherency and without that plot I mentioned, well it is just wasted screentime.
I could not watch this movie in one sitting, and even during my second sitting, I simply did not manage to watch the last 15 min. or so. 
Fair enough, you might not fall asleep to this movie, but it has nothing else going for it.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
310,karonfranklinchicken,Better than the last knight,7,10 September 2020,"This is movie is underrated. The action scenes are phenomenal, the composing and cinematography are some of the best things about the movie. I'll admit that writing at parts could've been a little bit better and sometimes gets a little messy but it really does have its moments where it shines",Transformers - Age of Extinction
311,TonightTurnYourWeaponsToSnow,"Michael Bay, you need a wake-up call.",2,31 October 2014,"Plain and simple, too long and too boring. First things first, why did we need to see the humans story for so long? It felt like I had watched Avatar 5 times before the story got going! Even during all these Robot battles, we're treated to a handful of humans and their running emotions.By the time we actually see the story unfolding, it's even more boring than the humans' story. This movie does not treat newcomers to the series at all, you'll just be left scratching your head.By the time it came to the final act, I was just left looking blankly at the screen and not listening, just waiting for the movie to end. How does it end? How it ends in all the other films, Optimus having another speech saying he'll be back and sh*t. This film could have been better if it was only 1hr 30mins. Worst of the franchise, worst franchise in general. DO NOT MAKE ANOTHER ONE.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
312,kylelahmeyersiphone,Yeaaaaahhhhhh Booooiiiiiiii,1,22 August 2019,"Another classic film starring Kevin Hart. Wait... sorry! DWANE ""THE ROCK"" JOHNSON! Oh, wrong again. I mean the other actor that is forced upon us in damn near every major big budget money grab of the summer. Introducing MARKY MARK!!!The movie sucked.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
313,ctladybird,This is the movie the franchise needed,9,28 June 2014,"With an attention to detail that seems unreal for a Michael Bay film, Age of Extinction was an excellent setup into the next Trilogy. The Optimus Prime we see throughout the film is not the Optimus we came to know. He has been betrayed by the very species he fought so hard to protect, and he has been backed into a corner. His mercilessness is a loss of faith in our kind. Mark Wahlberg shines as a father working hard to support his daughter (Who was also not overtly sexualized, which is against surprising in a Michael Bay film.) And get used to her boyfriend (who does not sound Irish, but perhaps it's because he's Irish-American?). What he and his family give to Optimus is a renewed faith in humanity, the idea that humans are not perfect. Speaking of his daughter, she reacts as most people would (scared shitless) but also has great moments of bravery. Stanley Tucci is a great ""villain turned good"" like we saw with John Turturro in transformers 1 and 2. Kelsey Grammar as the cold, to the point CIA agent was flawless. The idea of ""seeds"" to possible bring us the quintessons of G1 hopefully plays out well. It still fits in with the All Spark and like. As far as Drift goes, if you read the comics you know they got his character perfectly. His design is weak, given that they could have had a ball with Samurai themed armor. Also his Japanese theme isn't as offensive as I was afraid it could have been in that it wasn't used as the butt of a joke like Skids and Mudflap being the ""uneducated black men"" stereotype. Not sure if the technology improved or if Bay realized how to film robot fights better, but they were easier to follow than the previous movies. Bumblebee's characterization was also improved from the second and third films. Frank Welker as Galvatron as so good. It was very classic Megatron but it worked so well. The Dinobots were AMAZING. It is safe to assume they are the knights of Cybertron (the comic readers will know what's up) and their robot forms were also amazing (The attention to detail thing comes into play here) and the helmets based on actual knight helmets sold me. Cinematography wise it's still very much a Bay film, stylistically you know it's his work. There were plenty of jump cuts to product placement that weren't necessary. However there were some beautiful shots in this film as well. and yes calling it ""Transformium"" Makes sense because these are humans naming a compound. yes it sounds silly but what can you do? That's what the scientist nerds were calling it. As far as the ending goes, Rocket boots Prime fell flat for me. Bay could have had a montage of a ship being made for him from the remains of the other ships. I don't believe I missed anything here. All in all this is the film the franchise needed. It had a dark edge, it could be taken seriously. It wasn't just a bunch of offensive jokes and sexism. It was a legitimate film.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
314,afatedcircle,2hours 45 mins of bleh.,3,30 June 2014,"First off let me say I saw this movie in both 2D and 3D on the opening night and the next night. I tried my best to give it a chance since hardly anyone seems to agree with me thinking it's complete crap.First off, this is a continuation of a previous trilogy of movies. Therefore it would make sense that some mention of the previous human characters would happen. Bumblebee was Sam's guardian but apparently had no problem leaving him behind. Nothing is said throughout the entire movie about the human characters. We just know Autobots were being hunted by Lockdown. This may work in revamps but in continuations it doesn't.The plot and storyline are so full of holes it's almost like it was intended. What do we know? Well Autobots were being hunted by Lockdown, a CIA agent and a company that uses transformers to make a metal called ""Transformium"" so humans can make their own transformers. Cool, but not 2 hours 45 mins cool. It actually ends up being a story exactly like the other 3 stories. Optimus can't beat the main antagonist(Lockdown) without an upgrade. He gets the upgrade, fights the antagonist and still is nearly killed. Humans jump in and help save the day. Movie ends with him making a speech. Sound familiar? Yeah, been the plot of the previous 3 movies as well. Perhaps that would be interesting if the movie had dialogue or scenes that got you interested, instead the majority of the movie is unnecessary action scenes and explosions that jump back and forth between shots constantly. You can't create a story with only action scenes, something Bay doesn't seem to understand.Visually the movie is appealing. It's a Michael Bay film, enough said about that.If you're into scantily clad women with your robots, Nicola Peltz is in short shorts throughout the entire movie. Nevermind the fact they're trying to turn a 17 year old character in a movie into a sex symbol, which I found quite disturbing.The dinobots which previews were so full of are only in the movie for 20 minutes or so with very limited screen time. If you want to watch the movie just for them, just wait to rent it.Overall, the movie is crap. This is only a small list of why I think so. I know I'll be bashed based on my review but this is honestly how I feel. Don't waste your money on it. Just wait till it hits Redbox.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

316,jogre17,Not bad at all. Could have been better though.,7,18 November 2014,"First of all, there is no such thing as a perfect movie. Also, everyone has different taste in movies, so you can't trust everyone. Take it from someone who will watch any type of movie (me). I will literally watch anything from Sci-Fi, to horror, all the way to chick flicks and children's movies. I enjoy movies of all types.I always enjoyed the Transformers movies, but many of the other ones dragged on quite a bit and I started to lose interest in them at times. Age of Extinction was different. This one was able to maintain my attention the whole time and definitely a lot of non stop action and awesome effects, all thanks to Michael Bay.The only thing I didn't care for was the plot. There were a few holes in it that made me wonder ""Why Kade Yeager?"" (Mark Whalberg). There was no real true connection to bring him and his daughter into the plot. I think there should have been a better reason to have him other than the fact that he is an inventor good with robotics who just happens to find Optimus Prime hiding in disguise from humans. To me it's just a little weak. The acting wasn't bad, but the idea of a reincarnated Megatron (Galvatron) was pretty damn sweet!

Critics and fans alike can say whatever they want about the TF movies as they are entitled to their own opinion, but I have to disagree, as I find each movie enjoyable and a must see! What I particularly enjoyed about Age of Extinction is that the new leads: played by Mark Wahlberg, Nicola Peltz and Jack Reynor - were on the road the whole way through as they were being pursued by the CIA, when they uncover that they intercept Optimus Prime. Wahlberg's acting is splendid just like in most of his movies and Peltz's performance is a new fine acting addition to the TF series. The visual effects and action sequences take up most of the movie's incredible length and the weirdness, ridiculous dialogue and visuals and action mixed up all in one is what a great Popcorn movie is all about!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
320,wewatchedamovie1,Will Make Your &$% Numb. In a Fun Way.,7,1 July 2014,"Transformers 4: Age of Extinction gets better at a lot of things. Even if it still doesn't actually get anything completely right. Even if it is still full of mostly the same old garbage juice. Dizzying camera moves, slow motion shots, a downright stupid amount of buildings being crushed and the customary young girl belly button shot. Yeah, Age has all that and another hour of other unnecessary super crap that could have been cut out of the nearly 3 hour running time.BUT! We do get to replace the whiny Shia Labeouf with the likable Mark Wahlberg. Heck, we get a fresh slate with the entire cast. Plug and play characters? Sure! Only this time the fresh crop is way more likable and sympathetic. We aren't talking Oscar nominations here or anything but after three movies of the exact same people doing the exact same things (Think Tyrese running around stating the obvious as toughly as he can pretend to be. For THREE mother loving movies.) I'd rather change my name to Witwicky than see any of that nonsense again.There are still cringe-worthy lines throughout the script but the difference is this cast seems unload the ""what the fluck did he just say?"" moments as though they are in a stupid and fun blockbuster movie about toys. Offenders from the previous cast would say the same dumb shnit while trying to look cool. (See previous Tyrese comment). The jokes land a lot more when you don't want to throat punch the people saying them on screen. Hence, Extinction is also the funniest Transformer movie yet. It helps that the humor comes from actual written jokes and not just robots peeing on stuff. (see Transformers 2) Here's a big deal: the Transformers are way cooler in Age of Extinction. Sure, the people who have been into this since childhood aren't going to be completely pleased yet and they probably shouldn't be. But for those ""I don't know beans about Transformers"" people like me all that matters is the Autobots looks light-years cooler now than they did in the previous films. In every Michael Bay explosion porn that came before I hated just about every Autobot except Optimus Prime and Bumblebee. Here we get a killer Samarai-bot, a John Goodman bot and some assassin like bad guy Transformers that use big guns.Remember the ghetto bots? (refer again to Transformers 2) I'd rather own Jar-Jar Binks as a pet than ever see those craps again. In Extinction the bad guys are cooler and the Autobots don't make you want to jump off a building into a Mortal Kombat like pit full of spikes and skeleton bones. Also, the miniature sesame street looking things are barely in this film thank god. Oh yeah, and another thing? No big deal? Mother loving DINO BOTS. Optimus Prime with a big sword riding a m effin' Dinosaur Autobot.America.The special effects are by far the best of the series. This thing felt like a total theme park ride at times. (Wait..you did that on purpose you soulless goon!) Even though it may be for dirty superficial reasons that Bay wants to drop a gargagillion dollars on a single film for this, we can't really complain considering we have been seeing fit to pay the tab for it all these years. For the love of Nike commercials and gold chains you just have to laugh at the sheer fun stupidity of it all. We ask for too much from these movies. If it's a fun ride who gives a crap if it doesn't have anything to say? All that matters in Transformer land is does the fun out-weigh the boring. It passes. Although there is still too much boredom for a movie that is supposed to be this simple.After nearly three hours Bay's camera movements become nauseating and so do the so-stupid-I-want-to-kick-my-own-face-with-an-iceskate story lines. Seriously someone PLEASE take the pen and the camera from Bay halfway through production because when you don't we end up with conversations about robot souls and I swear to god if we EVER cover the ""humans don't like Autobots so they threaten to leave and come back again"" thing again I'm gonna tie myself to something heavy and roll off a boat into the middle of the ocean.Age of Extinction is more of the same, yet the best of the series.

Is it the best movie ever? No. Does it deserve the rating it has? No. I say it should at least gets a 7. For me, as a person that's watched all of the other transformers movies, it was exactly what I was expecting. It didn't have a perfect storyline. There were points that were supposed to be funny that weren't at all and some parts that seemed slightly cheesy but it was no worse than the other movies. There were also some parts that were awesome and very funny. This movie was meant to be a bunch of robots destroying things and looking total badass and they accomplished that. Overall I'm disappointed by the reviews it has. I saw some people giving it a 1. In what world does this movie deserve a 1? It is not the worst movie of all-time. I enjoyed it.

322,philpriestley,Very poor example of the fantasy action genre,3,8 April 2015,"Transformers: Age of Extinction is not doing it's genre any favours here. If anyone intentionally steers away from the fantasy spin off movie genre because they expect the experience to be lightweight, commercial and careless - they will find their arguments vindicated by this production. It's too dark and violent for my kids, it's too fluffy and incoherent for an adult.It is tied together by a complete over reliance on the suspension of disbelief.OK - it's a film about an alien robot race - so you have to start with a sense of abandoning reality somewhat - but still it would be nice if the film made some degree of physical sense and had some regard for reality.Human beings subject to massive collisions with buildings, vehicles, concrete and so on - will still sustain some form of injury (other than designer cuts and bruises) even if they are balanced in the palm of a huge benevolent machine.Put to one side the physical improbability of the action, the script is complete dog meat.Mark Wahlberg's character oscillates wildly from being the vulnerable, in his own head father, to the protective practical reality guy. The characters benefit from being less complex than that, and stick to be wafer thin and two dimensional. Nicola Peltz is hot, Jack Raynor is handsome. That's pretty much it. Special mention to Stanley Tucci's character, 'Joshua Joyce' is a billionaire inventor with a dark over bearing control streak and an obsessive attention to detail. However, he has a major character flip in the middle of the film that nobody has a second thought about - and he becomes a comedy device that falls in love with his secretary. Groan.The script is a re-write of every X-Men fantasy - with the usual dreadful diversity sub-plot of treating everyone as an individual and not as a race. To be fair to just about all of the X-Men film (and some of those films are really dreadful) they do that better than this film does. Somewhere in there, there might be a message about people who are hard on the outside are soft in the middle (Joshua Joyce, Optimus Prime etc) and those who are suppose to protect us might not be trust worth (CIA etc) and all that 'more than meets the eye' rubbish.If the film is - at one point - grasping for a sense of Dystopian, Orwellian edge by showing how the CIA could subvert the power of the White House through personal corruption with a corporate entity - it really falls down. It never really achieves that. Kelsey Grammar might as well turn to camera occasionally and offer us a pantomime laugh and a mustache twirl.The FX themselves overwhelm the movie completely and it becomes a case of - 'What can we get these robots to do?' - not 'what would help us to carry this film forward?'.The tenuous link to the dinosaur age is a pointless one that is never properly explored. It is basically there to introduce a herd of big robot dinosaurs towards the end. There is a 'find' at the beginning - with what appears to be a massive frozen T-Rex - nothing else at all to sustain that find or make it relevant in any way - until a place very much later on in the film. It's garbage. OK some of it has to do with a warning about human beings playing dangerous games with genetics - and the haunting reality of being one planet in a solar system of unlimited galaxies and planets - a haunting reminder of extinction - it's badly executed at best.Look - don't get me wrong - I'm sounding like a snob, I know that. I really do love a good action film too. I love to see a well executed, high body county, massive collateral damage, hero flick too. I love an old fashioned 'good versus evil' movie, and who the hell doesn't love a robot that can turn into an Italian sports car? We all love hot blonde chicks in short skirts, and I have enjoyed a lot of the films that Mark Wahlberg has done. Sadly, this takes all of those ingredients and gets lost along the way.I think it tries to have a little something that is meaningful within it - and by taking a step in that direction it immediately highlights how ridiculous the whole charade is. It's like turning on the lights in a nightclub. It just ruins the whole thing.Rather than trying to make something with a bit of meaning in it - it should have just made something coherent, furious, and full of big robots smashing it up. It would've been a lot more fun. Then that viewer who is skeptical of the genre would've walked away saying 'Well it was more enjoyable than I expected' - rather than - 'I feel completely insulted by that'.You'll never get your money or your time back if you watch this film.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

In a nutshell, TRANSFORMERS: AGE OF EXTINCTION is your typical Bayfecta: a visual and aural extravaganza designed to distract one from the vapid dialogue, a plot with more bullet holes than the Gaza Strip, and such overt sexualisation of nubile females that I learnt a new selfie angle #ColdWaterAirDryPlease. Throw in a running time equivalent to the entire Mesozoic period and you have a film that will satiate all manner of booms, boobs and blows for the viewer and a billion dollar bonanza for the box office.After inadvertently stumbling upon Cemetery Wind's primary target (and the film's moral compass), Optimus Prime, hapless inventor Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) becomes embroiled in a power struggle between paranoid CIA agent Harold Attinger (Kelsey Grammar) and egomaniacal visionary Joshua Joyce (Stanley Tucci) to possess the coveted metal transformium. Accompanied by temporary slapstick sidekick Lucas Flannery (T.J Miller), Cade's 'prosti-teen' daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz), and her not so secret, secret boyfriend Shane (Jack Reynor), Cade flounces alongside the Autobots leader to thwart Attinger's and Joyce's machinations and save the world by defeating the reincarnated Megatron a.k.a Galvatron. And just as you're ready to mock Michael Bay (TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES) and his 'bigger in Texas' filmmaking style one last time, he's beaten you to the punch by slyly introducing the Dinobots at the same extinction point as their cartoon counterparts booyah! Which made me think has Bay been subverting this entire movie? Why yes, yes he has. From the thematic subtext of zealotic American patriotism to its over-the-top story and dialogue, Bay is definitely having the last laugh through nearly three hours of intentionally exaggerated drivel. Since when did story and dialogue take precedence over physical action in this genre? That would be never, which is why Ehren Kruger (TRANSFORMERS: DARK SIDE OF THE MOON) should at least be applauded for coming up with so many cringe-worthy lines including ""This alien gun can really kick ass"".And let's face it, the regurgitated plot lines may be as inane as they are predictable, but that's not why you want to see it. You want to watch your childhood robots kick the ever- living daylights out of each other whilst Bay annihilates another US city in all its explosive 3D glory. And Stanley. You definitely want to watch the oracle of one-liners 'how do you say, ""get the **** out of my way"" in Chinese' Tucci. Touché Tucché – I should have thought of that one myself. Well people, Bay delivers that and so much more in spades. So go blast your senses, be stupefied by the boobs or blow your brains, either way, you can be guaranteed to leave with a smile on your face. And if not, remember this Joshua humdinger""I may have caused the apocalypse, but you brought your family to it""!You can catch me at my handle and at The Hollywood News.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
326,tinjo23,Michael Bay's worst film to date. Which is saying a lot!,3,30 June 2014,"Michael Bay once again takes an interesting premise and boils the material down to its bare minimum to make room for more explosions. Standard Bay movie sure. However, what he's also included in this disaster, besides development and plotting that make absolutely no sense, are two of the most worthless characters from a Bay film to date. A daughter that is not only useless, but also a loud mouth whiner and her boyfriend, who the movie can't decide if he's suppose to be playing hero or coward. The only thing I am sure of is the actor playing him is definitely not Irish (Worst Accent Ever!) and appears to only be playing one so he can be ridiculed for it.On that note, I'll also add Mark Wahlberg's man child but somehow mega hero, as a significant fault, as he spends the bulk of his screen time complaining about his daughter's love life and future, regardless of how many impossible, life threatening situations he's involved in. Wahlberg's Yeager may be more useful and intelligent than LaBeouf's Sam, but his presence becomes more annoying and unwanted long before the movie finishes (LeBeouf was at least watchable for a lot longer).What's even worse, the concepts involved, while nothing original, could have made for some interesting viewing material. The world turning on the Transformers after the war in San Francisco, using their DNA to create modified copies and focusing on a family that has had no involvement in the all around story until now, are all stronger plot lines than anything seen in the franchise so far. Which brings me to the biggest disappointment. This film does actually have a storyline! It's not all explosions and mindless destruction, there are reasons and even build ups to the huge set pieces. But Bay, having absolutely no handle on any of the material, turns it into nothing more than explosions and mindless destruction. ANY OTHER director worth his salt could have made this into something actually pretty decent. The only thing they would have to clear up or remove entirely is why the human race would fight off an alien race with another alien race (which are actually just more Transformers). Something Bay seems to believe makes any sense at all.So in conclusion, I put all the blame on Michael freakin' Bay. Someone, for the love of god, take this franchise away from him. It is dead in the water because of him. ...Though you can also blame Ehren Kruger for writing some god awful dialogue and whiny characters.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
327,jakimiku,Way too long and hollow,3,26 June 2014,"Set five years after Dark of the Moon, Transformers: Age of Extinction sets out to continue the franchise, taking a new path in more than one way. Lots of explosions, action scenes and robots wrecking cities up and we've got ourselves the fourth one.To begin with, there were a lot of weak points, the biggest challenge being the fact that the entire human cast was replaced. I felt that Wahlberg and Tucci did a good job, but the rest of them were terrible. A lot of it has to do with writing: the characters were shallow and didn't have any depth at all. At a running time of 2h45min you think it would be enough to flesh them out but no. Wahlberg's daughter just yells ""Dad!"" and screams her entire screen time. Her boyfriend is shoehorned in just to complete the clumsy romance but in the end is just a tool to move the plot. Sophia Myles, amongst others, is completely wasted. The fact that Bay chose to concentrate on the humans again, and failed with it again, speaks volumes.It was, however, good to see how Cade (Wahlberg) first comes across Optimus Prime and being a mechanic/inventor, revitalizes the beaten leader. The focus also shifted from Bumblebee to Prime as the main link to the protagonist, but oddly it was never explained why Bee left Sam in the first place, being his most loyal protector.Now, speaking of techs in the film, there was a lot of slow-mo. A lot. And it really took away from the action. It is okay to employ slow-mo sometimes, for example when the robots are transforming, but not at every single shot. Moreover, the transformings themselves were weaker than in the previous installments. I mean, in the first one when Starscream transformed into a plane in the middle of the flight or they were fighting/transforming in the narrow street, or in DotM during the fights, this depth was lacking in AoE. Also the fights weren't as good compared to the gigantic robot battles or human black ops tactics in previous films. Lastly, as cheesy as it may sound Optimus Prime riding Grimlock was pretty awesome. Even if Grimlock was in the movie for about ten whole minutes. And Lockdown the bounty hunter as the main villain was also done nicely.The film is way too long, the beginning stretches a lot, the middle even more, the finale as well. We are treated to a lot of badly written human characters who just slow the movie down and stretch. Even the endless explosions got tiring (boom, boom, boom and slow-mo all the time, why oh why?). But honestly, going in I thought this would be loads worse. In the end though, not as good as the first or the third, but still better than the second (not that this should count for anything as that was plain awful). Altogether, too long, too stretchy, way too much slow-mo, too shallow characters, some decent fights and action, Prime riding Grimlock and Wahlberg being his usual self. Could have been worse but not by much.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
328,shanc_sk,For the Transformers movie fans,7,28 June 2014,"You know what you are getting into when you buy a Transformers movie ticket. And nobody goes to watch Transformers expecting an award-winning story or screenplay. Don't know why the critics are crying about.Michael Bay loves to create cities getting devastated and as an action movie buff, I love such spectacles and if you are one I'm sure you would love that too. Nobody ain't doing this better than Bay. Awesome SFX with mind-blowing action sequences, kinda a clichéd storyline, deafening sound effects, widespread mayhem and epic one- liners from Optimus Prime and Hound. If you are a Transformers fan, then you just got more of the fun. Else you might be in for a headache plus its a bit longer than the previous installments.The upgrade here – u got Mark Wahlberg instead of a screaming kid. & the city under target this time is Hong Kong.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

330,jimelas-835-982916,Strictly here for the autobots,10,30 November 2014,"First and foremost if they just made an all autobot movie I would be so happy with it. Take out the lame human actors they are the ones who drag the story down in my opinion. I don't care about the human factor I'm here for the autobot's and all things transformer. I think at this point they are just forcing the human element hopefully the next movie will just be nothing but transformers taking place in space without lame humans watering down the story with lame actions and whining. I watch movies for entertainment value and this movie entertained me.That's the point of movies to entertain if you go to the movies looking for profound meaning than your time is better spent at museums and library's. I'm not going to nit pick and tear apart this movie that's pointless and lame to me. This is a franchise they have to keep building on it and really I don't care much about the story line I come to see Optimus Prime and the rest of the awesome Autobots fighting. That's all I really care about. I don't need anything else. Just let the Autobots be cool and do their thing. This is not a movie about profound life changing things it's about a childhood cartoon that was popular and now it's a live action movie. Stop expecting it to be something it's not. Also The humans in the story annoyed me and made me want to slap them. Whenever there is a human element in the transformer movies it just serves as a remind that humans are some petty greedy destructive creatures who are so whiny, ungrateful and just plain pathetic. Here these alien defenders are trying to save your planet and what's the thanks they are given? Time and time again you set out to destroy them. You are not allies but instead another enemy. I really hope the next movie is just all Autobot's leave the humans out of it.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
331,urgentneptune,Transformers 4: Age of Extinction Review,4,1 August 2014,"Transformers 4: Age of ExtinctionTransformers: Age of Extinction is the latest entry in the Transformers ""saga"" from director of awesomeness: Michael Bay. The movie also stars Mark Wahlberg, but his performance is less than noteworthy. I said previously that I wasn't going to review this movie, but I decided that it could only be fun, so here we go. Get ready for sarcasm.StoryAfter the events of Transformers: Dark of the Moon, all the Autobots are being hunted down by the government with the assistance of some freelance evil transformers. These evil-but-not-Decepticons-for- some-reason want to capture Optimus Prime in order to add him to ""the collection."" The government, in their typical selfish way, are hunting down the Autobots and Decepticons collectively and melting them down into. Wait for it.. TRANSFORMIUM. Ignoring the absolute awfulness of that name for a moment, Transformium is a sort of genetic-metal that all Transformers are made of. Funny that it hasn't been mentioned in any of the previous films. Hmmmm. Anyway, some government corporation has re-purposed the Transformium and is using it in order to manufacture their own Transformers. The idea is that the government will then use these robotic soldiers to rule the world or whatever. This fictional corporation, which also has a dumb name that I can't remember, makes a prototype named Galvatron. Galvatron is based on Megatron's genetic code and, unsurprisingly, he becomes self-aware and develops the urge to rule the world. Thus ends the Transformer portion of the story.Now for the human portion. Mark Wahlberg is a Texan mechanic with a daughter who I think is supposed to be the ""love-interest"" because she basically fills in for Megan Fox from the first two films. Marky Mark discovers Optimus Prime in a basement somewhere and repairs him. Optimus then saves Marky's family from the evil government agents and Mark Wahlberg decides that he owes Optimus and spends the rest of the movies repaying his debt.Obviously, the Transformer storyline is way more interesting, albeit a little ridiculous. My biggest problem with this movie is that they repeatedly enforce the idea that Transformers are not just machines, but living things. But the movie never develops the Transformers' characters. Instead, it focuses on the boring humans leaving the Autobots for which the movie is named are left looking like side characters. Besides, the plot doesn't really evolve throughout the movie and at the end, almost nothing is resolved. But hey, no one watches Michael Bay movies for the plot anyway. He's the master of explosions! So if you just want to see lots of action and good fight scenes, then this movie is up to par. At best.Acting/DialogueMark Wahlberg is arguably the biggest star in this movie, but his performance seemed forced. I don't think any of the actors in the movie actually wanted to be in the movie. Regardless, I will give out the award for best human actor and best voice actor.Best Transformer: John Goodman for his performance as Hound. He is by far the most funny and interesting Autobot in the movie.Best Human: Stanley Tucci for his performance as the CEO of the evil corporation. Dialogue is poor. Very poor. Composed of bad one-liners the script is uninteresting and unoriginal. SFX/ActionHere it comes. The category that everyone wants to see, especially for this movie. Does Michael Bay live up to his reputation as king of the extreme? No.Alright fine, I'll elaborate. Nothing looks real in this movie. Fight scenes don't usually play out like you'd expect them to. Granted, transformations look really cool and fight scenes have a lot more detail than in previous movies.The explosions are what got to me. Arguably the most appealing feature of a Michael Bay film are his epic non-cg explosions. In Transformers Age of Extinction, every explosion is way too over the top. With fireworks literally exploding out of nowhere, everything just seems unrealistic.Note: 3-D did not add or subtract much from the movie at all.ConclusionWhen editing this review I realized I went a little too easy on this movie, as I tend to do. Just to clarify, I did not like it at all. I give Transformers 4 a 4.5/10. If you still want to see it, I recommend doing now while it is in theaters. The special effects, despite their cheesiness, won't look as good unless they are on the big screen.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

This quality is one of the factor that makes this film a good one. In this movie, the ever hero changes another actor. Moreover, the ally robot is few because the army kills them. I was surprised at first by the change. The hero is a father , has daughter. He loves her but is a little selfish. They doesn't seems to get along . This series express the love of family every time. This work express it especially. They recognize them and respect them each other little by little. It is heartwarming. Of course, action scene is very excited and cool.

333,edwardscissorhands12-874-850830,Will Transformers Please Extinct for real...,1,8 July 2014,"Just for the record, I didn't actually mind the first three films. The first I gave a B, the second a C+, and the third a C. I thought that they were fun to watch and the plots were somewhat decent for a movie based off of a children's toy. I do not know what changed in TRANSFORMERS: AGE OF EXTINCTION, but this film was the furthest thing from enjoyable. Maybe I hadn't payed as much attention during my viewing of the last three films, but if you pay the slightest bit of attention to this installment and leave your brain turned on, you will be cursing yourself the entire time for wasting your hard earned money on a film as horrendous as this pitiful excuse of cinema. Every single word of dialogue in this lazy screenplay is laughable and dumbed down so that even a two year old can realize that its dull and stupid. So many conflicts are added into the film that remain unresolved and uncared for, which drove me insane after looking back and realizing i didn't need to be sitting in the theater for three damn hours. The CGI is obviously spectacular, but I am not giving points for good special effects. Just because the people that made the animation have brains does not make the film have them. The action sequences, though they look cool, are poorly directed and paced. There will be a random 5 minute showdown with literally fireworks, I'm talking the ones you see on the Fourth going off just for the sake of explosions, and then it will pause, ear-cringing quirky dialogue will be spoken between the underdeveloped characters, then the action will resume. I just summed up the entire movie in one sentence. The only thing I left out are the other traits of a Michael Bay film which are random blue beams going across the screen for absolutely no reason, tilted angle shots (Bay's way of trying to make himself seem more artsy than he is), a government conspiracy to keep the plot moving, and stupid characters making brainless decisions. Since this film has these traits, it proves itself to be a sheer rip off of the other three films in order to bank off the success of the last films. The sole reason these films are still being made are because people are still going to see them. So please, anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet and is reading this, I BEG you, do not see TRANSFORMERS: AGE OF EXTINCTION because it will mean the extinction of Michael Bay's little boy fun and possible prevent you from wanting to jump off a cliff. By far the worst movie of the year, and for a whir in that matter. GRADE: F",Transformers - Age of Extinction

It was also so hilarious Stanly tucci is such a funny actor him alone made the show worth seeing. something that was kind of dumb about it was that it was a little like the last transformers mixed with man of steel but i guess it worked out. so i would highly suggest you go see it it was an awesome and funny movie that made you forget how terrible the rest of the films were.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Everything else is not plausible at all and not believable, either. There's almost everything packed in a non-existing story and when you think the movie could be done, you really have still one hour to go! That's because the movie only consists of parts put together in a terrible way and it's after half of the movie that you simply can't stand it anymore.

It is an oddly paced, oddly edited, oddly voiced, and oddly corny flick. That said, I did not find it all THAT bad. It's odd throughout, and ultimately it sticks together in its odd way and forms a whole movie. It's just different from normal. It does contain some lines that make you wonder who was writing the script such as... ""Get the seed safely to the hills."" and ""When you look up at the stars just imagine one of them is my soul."" But you know what, the last one was touching in a way, considering a giant robot spoke those words. There are also a number of things that occur for no rhyme or reason, but, it's the movies, is everything supposed to have rhyme or reason behind it?There are probably 10 scenes at least that could be the grand finale of any movie with half the budget, it does seem to go on and on, but the visual stakes just get higher as it keeps going. I do honestly think that the special effects in this one are Oscar worthy, it's pretty much as balls out as any film as I've ever seen.I also think people are too hard on some movies. You know what, it might not be to your tastes but this film has some redeeming features. For one, there are no pointless sex scenes. They very easily could have thrown them in this, it would be the perfect setting for mindlessness. But they showed some restraint, kudos to them for that.Whatever this films faults and whether those faults are a matter of opinion or not, it avoids being completely crass and only goes there in a humorous fashion. In a way I found this movie to consciously mock itself and the rest of Hollywood while still being a very entertaining visual extravaganza.

Also keep an eye out for the 2001 Cadillac Cien concept car, it makes a very brief appearance.

343,neighborlee,Don't watch this if you don't want to have a great time ;),10,23 September 2014,"My friend and I sat perplexed,a hour or so into this movie, of the '6.1' rating of this movie on IMDb,and could only conclude, yet again, as so many movies before it,that trolls ( mostly )did their work yet again.Movies are meant, most, to entertain us,and this does a wonderful job, all at PG-131!What more do people expect ?I love it when movies an entertain, as this one with incredible visual gymnastics and grab us for 2.5 hrs, not wanting to leave the TV for the entire time; this movie does that.I know its another rehash of yet another transformer movie, but what does it need to do, to get a overall rating of more than 6.1 ????Thats insulting to not only the actors who did a fine job here,to the myriad of digital artists , producers and animators and to some people who may avoid it due to the low score.What rubbish.I saw the RogerEbert website who indicated its a movie for a child because as adults we put aside those things ( assuming its a dig, or *sarc), and my friend after I showed him that , said well who cares!,,I still watch Mr Rodgers!! Thats what I call not being afraid,to be as a child, once more.Does a movie have to do more than entertain and visually mesmerize us to get a decent overall rating ? Have some of you critics grown so beyond these kinds of movies that you thumb your nose at them as some backyard trash, forgetting to watch the 'credits' or view them here,to find that many great names in the production hall of fame are behind this ??The one thing I freely admit, is it seemed in one spot to drag a tiny bit , but as soon as the ' I need a break' moment flutters past, the action picks up again and as any transformer movie has done for us, we want to root for the underdog and our imagination of the outcome is rewarded in high fashion,and our attention is drawn again in full force.Just as this movie includes a line , ' humans think they are the center of the universe',so too do some 'criitcs' here and elsewhere, when they forget their childhood and go forth entirely in pessimistic mode and don't allow themselves to enjoy a utterly fabulous movie.So what if its mostly action sequences some often so full of things and animations on screen that its sometimes hard to see what is going on, but guess what, in real life this could happen as well,- get over it ;)This certainly was't star wars, but does it have to be, to have sat through it and had a wildly enjoyable ride ? ; of course not...It does the job of transporting us to a universe that just could be true, someday,as our vistas to the universe open up and we realize, we really aren't alone anymore.Thats the idea behind movies, to bring out that child, sometimes that may have been catapulted into adult life yet may still yearn for the wide eyed optimism and wonder we enjoyed as we grew up.This move doesn't need a 'deep' plot, it just needs a plot we can relate to,dialog that maintains our attention,visuals that sweep us along, acting that merges with and becomes its subject and the viewer grabbing a hold for the ride and accepting that reality has just been hijacked temporarily , allowing us to go outside our sometimes humdrum life and enjoy 2.5 hrs of a fantasy roller coaster.I enjoyed the harry pottery franchise with child like excitement as it drew us in with a deep plot, amazing visuals and meaning derived from a author for whom love and friendship meant a great deal, and it was conveyed with stunning authenticity .We may not have a deep plot here, although as my friend said and I agreed, this one is the best one yet as it introduces us to a new villain from a surprising source, and ends in a way not unlike that other movie I have fondness for , as it reminds us, sure, for some, in cliché ways ( not those who remain the wide eyed child full of mystery and unconditional fondness) what matters most in life.I don't see how anyone could expect more from a movie, to be entertained and touched in non superficial ways.I know its 'transformers' yet again, but its different enough, and full of incredible visuals enough, to warrant seeing it with others or just yourself curled up to a couch and popcorn.* highly recommended PG 13",Transformers - Age of Extinction
344,kierran89,Sigh,1,18 October 2014,"Dear oh dear. Where do I start? It is so depressing watching the demise of the Transformers franchise when it has so much potential to be an all time epic. I have loyally trudged on through all the Transformers films so far, and although being utterly disappointed, could at least pin point a couple of positives from each film. This film is the worst of a bad bunch, which is the only achievement it makes.Why oh why does Bay insist on portraying the Autobots as idiots with ape like brain power when he could have created a real depth and story line between them. Why does he insist on pathetic and incredibly shallow human story-lines that have no realism, depth, or real purpose.There are so many plot holes in this film that I'm not even going to spend hours of my time listing them. I'm still sat here wondering what the actual plot was to this film to be honest.I quite enjoyed Wahlberg's performed in the boxer and thought that he might add some seriousness to this and get away from the corny humour of previous Transformer films. Unfortunately his performance was cheesy and weak. At least Shia LeBeouf forced me to laugh a few times in spite of myself. Nicola Peltz should go back to modelling (I can only assume that was her job before this film) - her face was literally stuck on one expression for the duration of the film. I was going to give her the benefit of the doubt and peg it as severe botox until I realised that yes, she really is just that bad of an actress.I hate to be so negative and wish I could put something positive, but all I can think right now is that I have just lost 2 and a half hours of my life and rather annoyingly can't rate this film with 0 stars.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Worse still half the transformers in the movies are moronic Laurel and Hardy clowns with learning difficulties.2, All the transformers looked the same for three entire movies which made the battles a complete borefest.

The whole Galvatron and Megatron tearing a rift in the space time continuum... The whole Autobot resistance thread on Cybertron. What do we get. The recycled basics from Pirates of the Caribbean. JEEZ!So is Age of Extinction any better?Yeah. It's better. not OH MY GOD I YOU MUST SEE THIS MOVIE better, just better than the really crap ones that came before.They have worked much harder to make the Transformers readily identifiable, even if they only mention their names once in the whole movie and if you missed it then you are screwed for the 3 hr duration. I know there is this bright green one with a trench coat but I don't know who he was.Adding Mark Walberg and a host and actors with a bit of stage craft did, shock horror, improve the human bits. The Father / Daughter / Dodgey Boyfriend triangle had a few jokes. Also Stanley Tucci sparkles as one of the villains. Let's put it this way. its blew that last lot of actors away. Whether that was hard work is debatable.Bad bits:The plot is still pap. I've worked out how the next two movies are going to pan out already. Remember the mean horrible East India Company hunting down the pirates in the pirates of the Caribbean? Yeah they are basically going to stretch At world's End plot over three 3hr movies.If you went to see dinobots, you've were conned.Marvel Comic fans will still be wondering why all transformers are acting like clowns on a children television program.If I could only see either Tranformers or Sin City 2 then It'll be Sin City 2.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
346,tyse1,EXPLOSIONS..............explosions....,3,5 July 2014,"The explosive nature with which American box office records were being broken on opening weekend promised big things about this unnecessary third sequel in the Transformers franchise. Since Megan Fox started sleeping around and Shia Labeouf isn't 'famous anymore', Bay has recruited Mark Wahlberg to befriend the autobots and then stand their for 3 hours while a load of stuff blows up around him. Accompanying him on his quest to make sense of the plot are a few other horrendous actors nobody's ever heard of before, which naturally includes an insanely hot female who can't seem to lose her makeup no matter how much dirt, ash or Transformium (no really) is thrown at her. This time round, the limited story line of the transformers going into hiding and the humans hunting them down is outlined at the beginning of what proves to be a rather compelling, and though unoriginal, thoroughly engaging first act. The scene is set and we get to know our characters more than you might expect to, gaining insight into their life stories and ultimately caring more about their fate. The problem is, in part, the film's greatest asset - Wahlberg and Tucci stand out like a sore thumb for all the right reasons, leaving every other two-bit 'actor' to deliver utterly unconvincing performances alongside true professionals. The end result is almost embarrassing, especially when you consider that this is an entry in the franchise that foolishly chooses to focus more on the boring human characters than their robotic counterparts. Now, this is where the real problems begin to arise - if I walk into a blockbuster that's directed by Michael Bay and has a near 3-hour running time (far too long), then I expect to see a shed-load of action, explosions and cool visual effects. Although this is pretty much what you do get, the emphasis on the humans force the transformers into the background, making the battles almost a distraction to the over- complicated and often boring dialogue tossed back and forth between boring actors who just look like they couldn't give a toss - it also doesn't help when the soundtrack and screenplay feel somewhat of an afterthought; not to Bay: corny one-liners don't make up for half an hour of lazy dialogue.In conclusion you pretty much get what you expect from Transformers: Age of Extinction, although the intimidatingly lengthy run time feels twice as long following a repetitive and disappointing conclusion, whose ultimate purpose is to set up entry no. 5 - but we're wise to the act now - I wouldn't slog through that again if you paid me.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
347,johnnyjan16,Massive Michael Bay Critic - Still Enjoyed It,7,17 July 2014,"First of, I really don't like any of Michael Bay's work. I know what to expect - God-awful humour, bikini clad woman and plot holes galore. When I read the reviews it really put me off.But I actually really enjoyed Age of Extinction.The lead cast were due for a major overhaul; Michael Wahlberg and Nicola Peltz are the first leads in this series that I wanted to do well. Peltz wasn't leaning over a bike in the blazing heat, she wasn't too good looking to get dirty. Kelsey Grammar and Stanley Tucci play their parts well - even if Tucci is given the comedy makeover by Bay. The CGI is impressive again with a good musical background. Luckily, there's no transformer scrotum like they did in Revenge of the Fallen (god, that scene was the worst i've ever seen).There are still some stand out cons - Age of Extinction is far too long and ditches an interesting plot half way through for more explosions and clashing metal. You get some of Galvatron but he doesn't really play much of a part but to set up the next film.Hopefully for the next film, Paramount choose a Director who can carry on a decent story. This film definitely isn't a reboot; Bay is limited in his vision and even though I enjoyed this, another Transformers CGI marathon doesn't do it for me. However it is still better than the last three and a marked improvement in the Bay Hall of Shame.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
348,cgrill8,Almost the best of the 4,8,30 June 2014,"OK, I saw it opening weekend, and I cannot understand all the hate. (well, I think I have an idea, but no one will touch it so I won't either, because it is a major spoiler). Speaking of which, Kelsey Grammar was a wonderful villain! On with the review: It's been 5 years since the battle of Chicago. The Transformers are being sought out for various reasons. The 'bad guys' are supposedly going after Decepticons for 'materials', except they're going after more than just Decepticons... If Tucci had a silly metal cap on his head he could have been Dr Arkevil from the G1 cartoon. There are many more references from the previous Transformer shows that I thought were done rather well. An old villain does come back. Another obscure Autobot? comes back too. It is tied to the previous 3 movies. Now let's inject something from G1 shall we? Think back to the creation of the Stunticons and Aerialbots. What plot was going on during those two episodes? A plot device comes from that episode that was also seen curiously during Beast Machines. Enter a new character from the Animated series... possibly the best new character in the Movie Universe. He's awesome (yet another villain).Despite the naysayers, the plot was pretty good. And Prime had an ace up his sleeve he wasn't sure he wanted to use, but had to. The effects were great over all (a few times it seemed to slip). There were some neat elements used. And don't forget, in the first season of G1... Autobots and Decepticons all flew in robot mode. After the first dozen episodes I took it, it took too much energon for them to fly in Earth's atmosphere... Now let's take a page right out Season 3 G1, from the Five Faces of Darkness, I won't say what, and to the plot. Even then we can only still guess... Now I thought the acting was well done, it's been worse. I was hoping the language was toned down... somewhat, but not really. I took my 9 year old daughter, and was ""we don't say"" about every 6 minutes, so in a sense it still felt like the first 3 (PLEASE WATER DOWN SOME OF THE LANGUAGE)... BUT it was so much better overall, no lewd humor, and no real sexual humor. There was some sexual innuendo twice, but that was about it. There is much more Transformer footage this time around. Prime's character really gets some added development unlike any we've seen before. He's not the stoic cardboard cutout of G1 anymore. He's not continuing to make speeches or saying ""I AM OPTIMUS PRIME."" Every 20 minutes like the other 3 movies (or so it felt). Cade and Prime really have an interesting relationship and it showed. What the movie lacked was showing respect for your parent(s). I couldn't stand that. But everything seemed much more... personal this time around on many different levels. Overall the action seems more intense, the plot held better than Revenge of the Fallen. The ending really opens a few questions and leaves us with a decent cliff hanger. Overall the movie had a good opening and decent ending while teasing us for more. Yeah, it is a long movie... but it flowed so well, it didn't seem like I had been sitting for 3 hours. My two gripes would be the boyfriend character, and KSI's transformations were odd. They make some sense after re-seeing Ravage sneak into the facility holding the shard in Dark of the Moon, but still... it's...different. I'd watch it again when the time can be be made. Very enjoyable movie. Almost as memorable as the 2007 movie. My two gripes would be the length, the boyfriend character, and KSI's transformations were odd. They make some sense after re-seeing Ravage sneak into the facility holding the shard in Dark of the Moon, but still... it's...different. Overall, a great movie.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Many explosions, exotic cars and beautiful women.. however this series still need a refresh idea. The story is only better than the Dark of the moon and not better than two movies before.I am fans of Transformers series since its cartoon played on television. See Autobots and Deceptions at big screen always amaze me, especially with Bay behind these projects. Michael is really well done on the shots as well as on the previous trilogy.Mark Wahlberg as Cade Yeager, played in a different role with Shia did on past, in my opinion he show more guts in this movie than Shia did. Nicola Peltz is so beautiful and act natural enough for me.The sound is really outstanding and picture is so great on IMAX. The duration was long enough for me.

I wasn't sure how it was going to pan out, not starring any of the original cast. I've read a lot of negative reviews and do you know what?? I really don't think they're justified. Yes the plot is a bit lame in places but at least it has one. It could have done with half hour being cut off....but.... These films are purely for entertainment purposes. I love all the special effects and cgi. I have 2 small kids and they both absolutely love all the films. Especially this one with the beasts in it. Grimlock has become the new favorite in our house. How ever bee is still mine!! The acting is not the best,and yes it has cheesy one liners etc but that's what these sorts of films are about.

I think it was a bit long, and some of the dialog at times was just taking up screen time. Wahlberg had some pretty funny lines. I am not sure how I felt about the direction the Autobots were taken this time around. Exciting to see the Dinobots. The effects were great as always and the fight scenes were pretty good too. I know many are not a Michael Bay fan, I happen to like his action films and look forward to another Transformers. It was nice to not have 2 hours and 45 minutes of Shia too!

After what seemed like ages I checked my watch... only a freaking hour! It felt like 2 hours - I didn't know then I had nearly 2 hours to go - had I known, I'd have probably left, several already had. The point where I knew this movie was a turkey (for sure), was when Kelsey Grammar's character agreed to shoot an innocent for reasons that would result in the opposite desired effect. You can't get information from someone shot in the head - face-palm. The only parts that didn't make sense was; The beginning, the middle, and the ending. In other words it made no sense, IE: NONSENSE. Watching nonsense for 2.75 hours makes your brain hurt, the prospect of seeing TF4 again, makes me suicidal.

354,zampino-2,Some advice for the producers and directors,1,10 October 2014,"I enjoyed the previous Transformers movies, but this was a complete disaster. So here's some advice for the producers and directors - Character development: This movie was a bunch of one-liners and clichés, I didn't care one bit about Wahlberg's character, nor did I think he was actually an inventor. Without a little heart this was just a mechanical cartoon.Cartoon: I know CG makes everyone excited. But this looked like so much of a cartoon, with hardly anything like reality. Did you really step back and think this movie had any gritty realness? The scenes in the space ship, or wherever they were, were overly complicated, plasticy, and pointless. I love eye candy, but it needs to feel real.Plot: What the hell was this movie about? Most of the time I had no real idea what was going on, there were so many plot elements thrown out in shorthand, references to characters I didn't fully recall. Nothing made a lot of sense in this chaotic storyline.Length: Really, you couldn't find a way to trim this movie to 2 hours? There was so much waste in the time line, mostly for overexcited animation that didn't do anything for the story, or dumb and pointless character comments. I was so bored and lost... Couldn't you have focused a bit to make an interesting story, to excite with less frequent explosions, crazy camera angles, and generally hyper activity? I have no idea what the criteria and expectation was for this movie, but stepping back a bit would have easily shown the excess of this movie. I hope the next director remembers to tell a story.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

358,invernessmovieclub,It won't win awards but it makes no excuses for what it is!,7,2 July 2014,"Not one to be defeated, Michael Bay has returned with a ""re-boot"" - Age of Extinction (AOE) being set a few years after part three (Dark of the Moon - DOTM) with a new cast including Mark Wahlberg. The result is an enjoyable but not entirely successful popcorn movie. We are advised early on that after the battle of Chicago in DOTM, Transformers are now being hunted by a special branch of the CIA. The government feels mankind will never be safe while the robots exist on Earth. Mark Wahlberg plays Cade Yeager who is a broke inventor and single dad who unearths Optimus Prime (leader of the Autobots) after purchasing an old abandoned truck. Soon after they find themselves on the run from dangerous CIA agents, along with his rebellious daughter, her boyfriend and four Autobots including fan favourite Bumblebee. The plot thickens when we are introduced to Stanley Tucci's character, billionaire Joshua Joyce who has discovered how to break down the Transformers metal (called Transformium) and create new more advanced robots that they plan to use for American defence. We discover that the big bad Megatron who was killed in DOTM is still influencing matters and has a plan to capture what is known as The Seed – a power source which is what originally created the Transformers. The visual effects are still devastatingly real – even more so than the previous movies and the action extremely impressive as you'd expect from a director who thrives on thrills and spectacle – explosions and slo-mo running from danger is a given as often as possible. Mark Wahlberg is on decent form and proving he can play pretty much any part with ease. The appearance of the Dinobots for the showdown is a welcome addition, although they don't get as much time as they should. Unfortunately at 164 minutes the film is far too long and some of the action scenes are drawn out longer than necessary. The conclusion is a bit stupid and, although a lot of the comic relief from previous films is gone, there are the occasional attempts at humour which aren't always required. There are also several characters who don't really serve any purpose. AOE will not win any awards and it makes no excuses for being exactly what it is – a big, silly piece of entertainment that is an improvement on the last two films. Turn your brain off and you'll enjoy it.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
359,LivingWitness,"It's bad, even by the standards of Michael Bay films",2,20 April 2021,"Michael Bay seems to be one of the very few directors who actively gets worse at directing movies as he gets older. With the movies he did prior to making the Transformers series, you can at least kinda make the argument that they're watchable if not good. With these movies, they're only watchable if you've never seen an action movie before.Age of Extinction is bad even by that low bar. There's been very few times in my life when I've actively wanted every human character in a movie to die horrible deaths, but this is one of those cases. This is even worse than the previous Michael Bay Transformers movies: while. Shia LaBeouf and. Megan Fox didn't get great characters in the previous movies, I didn't really want them to die either.To Age of Extinction's credit, it did indulge me on one occasion early on. T. J. Miller's character dies fairly early on in the movie. Unfortunately, that left a bunch of other annoying characters alive. It also reveals the weakness of Bay's directing and the screenplay he was working with--ordinarily this would have been a tragic death, but here it was just a relief.This death also reveals one more issue with the movie. T. J. Miller was ostensibly the movie's comic relief character, but he wasn't funny. Even the previous movies were able to perform some very basic comic relief. The ""stop lubricating that man"" scene in the 2007 movie was a juvenile joke, but at least it was kinda funny if you were drunk or high. Age of Extinction couldn't even pull that off.I think where Michael Bay and the writers responsible for these movies generally don't get is that nobody really cares about the human characters in these movies. They could make them just two hours (or, in this case, closer to three hours) of robots fighting nonstop and they'd be better movies. These aren't really the kind of movies where there needs to be a lot of focus on anything other than the robots.With the exceptions of Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and possibly Megatron, you're not really going to remember the names of any of the other Transformers featured unless you've seen the movie a bunch of times or if you were a fan of the toys growing up. For the most part, any one of the Transformers that isn't one of the Big Three is probably just going to be labelled as ""Oh yeah, that one"" in your head.The best thing I can say about this movie is that the action scenes in this movie were generally easier to follow than the action scenes in the previous movies. If you've seen the previous movies, you'd probably consider that an improvement. The downside to this is that (according to IMDb's trivia section for this movie) there's only seventy minutes of action. That leaves you dealing with the grating task of watching the most annoying characters imaginable for the other ninety-five minutes.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
360,confrank,Transformers 4: The day I lost faith in humanity,1,13 May 2015,"Transformers: Age of Extinction, starring some actors standing as a cliffnote to the Michael Bay extravaganza, was one of the highest grossing movies of 2014. It's facts like this that is the reason I occasionally lose faith in the human race. I do have a small confession to make before continuing, I actually did enjoy the first Transformers movie. Hell, even the third one has its moments where Michael Bay seems to calm down and try to film some coherent action with reasonably interesting plot developments. In this fourth instalment, that's all gone. This one is essentially a 3-hour promotion for over 20 international corporations (I lost count after that), filled with fireworks, flying scrap metal, awkward attempts at comedy and a touch or racism. At one point, there's a 40 second portion dedicated entirely to Bumblebee's transformation into the latest Chevy Camaro. We now have commercials built into movies, it could only be you Michael Bay.Let's talk about the main characters of this movie. No, I don't mean Mark Whalberg's character, who just so happens to be completely wasted in this. I actually mean the products of Bay's special effects team. Despite this being the latest entry in the franchise, the special effects are arguably the worst they've been, with action scenes so disorienting and mindless they resemble fights I created when I was 6 with my action figures by smashing them together in mid-air. All of it is utterly pointless and contributes nothing, with the only mercy being the pauses in between as the actors try desperately to sap some comedy out of their pathetic script material. The lesser of the two evils I suppose.I could almost forgive some of these problems if this trainwreck wasn't almost 3 HOURS LONG. A large fight at the hour and a half point of the film seemed to signify some sort of conclusion, until I realized in horror we were only halfway done before turning to an entirely new location and introducing a new plot thread. At this point, I was already checked out and waiting in misery for the end.I can't think of a single reason in favour of watching this movie. It's way too long, it fails in all of its 'comedic moments', it has no plot, and its action scenes are seizure inducing nonsense. My advice, go find a copy of The Rock and enjoy a movie from a time when Michael Bay was a competent filmmaker.FINAL VERDICT: Transformers: Age of Extinction is a desperate attempt at an action movie that is unbearably long and mind-numbingly dumb.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

362,JMT-Studios,You most likely know what to expect walking in,2,29 June 2014,"Oh boy.. here goes nothing.So Transformers: Age of Extinction is the fourth installment of the Transformer movie saga and is once again directed by Michael ""jerk out explosions"" Bay.We have a lot to talk about here today. So I'm gonna be honest I think people are being just a little too harsh on this movie. Don't get me wrong, it's bad. But I will say that it was better than revenge of the fallen so it gets points there.So what's our story? I'm gonna be honest, I have no freaking clue. From what I could muster up, it seems humans want all the transformers off the planet but there's this other thing where a company is using the metal transformers are made of to make their own kind of transformers that like break down into these little cubes and there's another plot with this thing called the seed and one of the robots that the factory made named Galvitron has Megatrons mind inside his head but for some reason doesn't go by Megatron and just keeps the name that the humans gave him. I couldn't follow any of it. This movie like the others follows the 3 act system that the first one made. Introduce main characters, government steps in with something against the transformers, 45 minute fight sequence. The most predictable thing ever.What about the effects? I think they just put all their money into pyrotechnics because the CGI in this movie is awful. Just awful. The worst of the saga. There's a scene where two human characters are fighting and one gets thrown out a window and you can actually see the slight blur around his sides where the green screen was. The cube transformers looked very much like they weren't actually there and at times really hurt your eyes cause you couldn't follow how they transform. Same with the other transformers, unlike in the first one, when they transform you just see a bunch of crap move around and then they're robots and back again. In the first you can see where every little piece went and it was so cool to see. With this, not so much. Also this really isn't an effect but I think the subtitle guy just got tired one day and was sick of translating what the Chinese people say so as these two guys are talking to each other in Chinese, one of their friends comes over and starts talking to them in plain English and the guys respond in Chinese and then the guy who just spoke English speaks Chinese to them. I don't know, maybe that's just a nit pick. How can we not talk about effects in a Michael Bay movie without mentioning explosions. I never thought I'd say this but there were so many explosions that they actually began to bore me. It takes talent to make someone bored of something that can make action scenes even more fun. Michael Bay just had a field day with this one.How about the characters? I'll tell you, I did not give a single crap about anyone. They all acted just fine but I just didn't care about them at all. They were just kinda.. there. They seriously could have been taken out of the whole movie and it may have gone the exact same way. Or Optimus would have just stayed in hiding forever. As for the transformers we have Optimus and Bumblebee as pretty much the only returning ones from the old movies with some very minor exceptions and then 3 completely new Autobots. One is a stereotypical assassin, one a stereotypical army guy and one a very stereotypical Japanese samurai. They made him really really Japanese. I kinda liked the army guy one but besides that I just did not care about any of them. Which sucks because 2 of them are played by some great actors, John Goodman and Ken Watanabe. Although if you told me it was Jackie Chan I most likely would believe you.I gave this a 6/10.

363,akik1259,"Constant, mindless destruction, in other words: more of the same.",2,15 August 2015,"First off, this movie over 2 1/2 hours. It drags on for a LONG time with drawn out action/destruction scenes, but that's not really a good thing.The human characters, as in the other movies, are bad. Mark Wahlberg is the lead here, replacing Shia LaBeouf.He is slightly better in the lead role, but that's not really saying much. His daughter, played by Nicola Peltz, is mostly just there to whine and scream and barely contributes anything, and her boyfriend is even worse. Stanley Tucci and Kelsey Grammar are pretty much one-note characters here.Moving on to the robots, a whole bunch of new ones are introduced, but they all pop up pretty much at random, and are barely given any characterization. Optimus returns and is pretty much as bland as ever. There are two enemies here, Lockdown and Galvatron. LockDown is an OK villain, but Galvatron is built up as a huge enemy and then turned out to be pretty much a non-threat. And then there are the dino-bots, which are huge and cool looking, but again, they pop up out of nowhere, and are only on screen for a few minutes before disappearing.On the whole, the acting is bad, and the script is even worse. There are hardly any memorable lines in this. The plot makes no sense (no surprise), and the action scenes, which are the main selling point of this movie, go on FOREVER. Really, the last 30- 40 minutes is basically one long action scene, with very little explanation to what is actually going on. The SFX are still great, sure, but it's really nothing we haven't seen before in many other movies.By the end of it all, you're just sort of numb and/or exhausted. Also, (and this has been my problem with the other movies) this movie wraps up way too quickly with no epilogue. Really, all that action and barely any fallout.

The makers of this movie know that children are watching transformers, it's not an R rated film, they know exactly what they're doing to condition children. The ""minorities"" in this film are also comically stereotypical. They've managed to turn a benign children's cartoon series into a metaphor for the mass immigration of western society but portray anyone against the mass immigration as being evil, phobic and regressive. Communists have controlled the media for over 100 years and most of these communists are members of a single ethnic group that is not native to the areas they disproportionately rule over, this makes their actions outright genocide.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
365,SixseventyOne671,Decent movie but could have been written better,10,30 June 2014,"I've seen all 5 TransFormers movies (1986 version included). The main downsides to this movie were the plot could have been written much better and the script could have also been much better...a bit too cheesy of dialogue. I did however enjoy this movie, it goes into a bit more depth of lore of the TransFormers.I am sort of looking forward to the next movie only if they bring in characters from Season 3 of the Original TransFormers, the Quintessons (creators of the TransFormers).Top things to this movie was: Their nod to the original series with Optimus Prime as a Cab over Engine and Galvatron being voiced by Frank Welker (however in the original movie he was voiced by Leanord Nimoy) as well as him looking somewhat of a skeleton which is also a bit of a nod to the 1986 movie when Megatron was being changed by Unicron.Overall I felt like the movie was really good, yes it was drawn out but still I felt like it was really good and cannot wait for the next couple movies.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
366,angell-an-wright,Actually really good,10,30 July 2014,"I am not really a huge fan of transformers. I mean i did like the other movies but i wasn't really expecting that much from this one. When i saw this in the cinema i wasn't expecting a lot. i expected the odd laugh, tiny amount of actual transforming and a dull storyline. When watching it i was actually pretty surprised at the fact there wasn't a lack of transforming. Literally they started transforming within the first 10 or 20 minutes. The storyline was quite funny too! the whole stroppy teenager with overprotective dad thing was really funny. the acting was very good and when it gets like half way the action and storyline intenses and gets pretty amazing. The bit near the ending is just spectacular! the amount of action at the end really made it get a 10/10. Even with the action there was still a storyline and humour. It was a really really really good film and i can't wait to get it on DVD when it comes out so i can experience it again :D It is definitely worth the money to see it at the cinema and it is the best transformers film yet... but i can't help but feel like they are going to make another film as the ending is just a cliff hanger in my opinion but still a really good film and i highly recommend to everyone! Well worth the 10/10 :)",Transformers - Age of Extinction

368,BremenDruid,The most boring action-filled movie I have ever seen.,2,14 July 2014,"Let me start off by stating that I am not a huge Transformers fan, I never really watched the show as a kid and I didn't really play with the toys or games. Having said that, I remember being highly impressed with the first Michael Bay Transformers movie when I saw it in theaters. Was it a perfect movie? No, but as far as a mindless action flick went it was pretty good. It had great effects and the action was well done. This movie has the benefit of better graphics, but loses anything else. There is no character development, the dialogue was full of cheesy lines and unfunny humor (there was one character that I actually cheered for when he died because his dialogue was nothing but crappy one-liners), and there was no cohesiveness to the story. The biggest sin that Bay committed on this movie, however, is he made the action boring. When you get to a certain point of this movie and you see another explosion, that looks exactly the same as the last 15 that happened in the last 3 seconds of the film, you start to wonder why you should care for this threat? For that matter, why should the audience care for any of these characters? None of them display anything that makes the audience connect with them, and because of this you don't care for any of them. Sadly Michael Bay has not learned that character development and plot are more important than constantly filling the screen with action. In a good movie you care about the characters, so when a threat comes against them you are emotionally invested in the character and when they come out on top it is all the more rewarding (or crushing when a character you care for loses). This movie is more akin to dangling the keys in front of an infant, it has just as much noise and sparkle and just as little substance.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

It's a real shame, I could actually visualize Goodman standing behind a microphone reading page after page of catch phrases the filmmakers could slot into fight scenes. instead of paying attention to the movie.The visuals are as every modern blockbuster brings them: highly rendered and often in slow- motion with various explosions (I didn't realize glass explodes into fire when broken) set to some strings or the occasional synth. The acting is terrible. I mean really really bad. Even understanding that this is a complete science fiction/fantasy film, about giant talking robots from space, doesn't explain how a beefcake ""inventor"" suddenly becomes a military grade sniper with an alien gun.

I would try and list the epic failures of story telling here, but its likely I would run out of space.Even the set pieces fell flat almost exclusively. The only redeeming qualities was a bit of decent banter between Cade and Shane over the relationship with the daughter, who was decent eye candy but little else.If you are looking for the slightest bit of coherence and logic in a movie, look elsewhere.

Overall the best Transformers movie so farCONS: (1) 165MIN OF ITS TIME LENGTH - Movie like Transformer shouldn't have this time length!!], (2) POOR PLOT – I think Michael Bay (Director) don't get much time to focus the main story along with the characters developing because he spend his most time for basically CGI/ACTION/STUNTS. If the try then they could have done a much better job and can developed the characters more and had better dialogue as the characters had potential.I Know most people will not like this movie because of one major thing that is its length.MAN ITSSS 165MIN!! YES APPROX 3 HOUR of EXTINCTION!! Can You Handle this. I don't think an action film like Transformer should have this time length!! If they make it of 3 HOUR why they don't realized to split this to two part like Transformers: Age of Extinction Part 1 and then Transformers: Age of Extinction Part 2.. . I loved the first three transformers movies, the acting/humor was superb and the action was AMAZING. And this time the action is far batter then previous and the GRAPHIC is AWESOMEbut the thing that ruin this movie i.e. 165MIN OF ITS TIME LENGTH, (2).

Transformers AOE isn't perfect though, lets name some things wrong with this film. 1. It's WAY TOO LONG! This film being 165 minutes is only 11 minutes longer than that of Transformers DOTM. This movie has moments that feel like they never end, scenes like when they argue weather Shane can date Tessa. 2. the Dinobots are wasted and are terrible. All Transformer movies have an allure, 1st being transformers, 2nd being Devastator, 3rd being Patrick Dempsey, and this being the Dinobots. The reason they are bad is they're in the film for about 15-20 minutes, which is inexcusable. 3. Structurally same, again. This movie is the same as the previous 3, you got the underdog, hot chick, they need to stop the government from doing something bad, etc. This movie gets a Worst movie ever because despite Lockdown having a gun for a face, he isn't called Gun-face.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
374,pierce-declase,Boring...,1,2 July 2014,"Lets just tell you straight up, this movie was boring, like really boring. I found myself wanting to leave with an hour left to go. My friend also shared the same thought, after the movie, i said to him i was planning to just leave and he said i was thinking the exact same. That's got to say something. I have watch the previous transformers a few times, i never really have enjoyed them, The first one was good and third was OK, second was rubbish and this was worse than anything. What to expect from this movie is action, well really your just going to be watch action for around 2 hours, its so long and drags and drags. The story line is just well nothing, same old crap. The only good thing is the ending. I really do not want people to go watch this movie because, one you will waste your money and two you will support this film. Even though its already made the most money this year out of all the movies, which is just disgusting to see. The only positive of this movie is good Mark. Great actor and did well with what he had in this movie. His little story is hardly interesting but for most of it i enjoyed it i guess a little when he was i don't know doing something. This is the most negative review i have done for a movie, which of course i do not like to do. I usually like to say positive things about movies not matter what, but this was really a bad movie.

Stanley Tucci saves this from being a complete disaster. Nicola Peltz eye-candy for the father dragged along by his kids.Cons: Too long, too many visual fx, not enough story. Confusing to the point of distraction. Editing all over the place. Bizarre music and sound choices.I watched this because I had nothing better to do, (should've stuck with sorting the lint in my pockets) anyways: When your watching a movie and all you're thinking is 'who is that?, which side is he on?, what the hell is going on?' then it doesn't bode well.There is so much going on in this movie it actually starts to get on your nerves, I love sci-fi but not to the extent where almost everything on screen is being blown up, shredded or mangled. But some how our intrepid humans continue to survive some insanely stupid crashes and explosions.Most of the characters in this movie are non-entities, neither like or dislike any of them except Stanley Tucci, billionaire robotics genius starts out has a megalomaniac - but by the end a lovable rogue. Brilliant.Most if not all of the 'Bots' voices are almost indecipherable, I really struggled to understand half of their dialogue.

376,ambercatgoddess-484-733898,It is awful that 1 Is unfortunately the lowest number.,1,27 December 2014,I forgot I had this movie for a few weeks. But when I found it I set up an evening with my partner and myself to watch. I was going to add watch and enjoy but that is a lie. This movie I actually wondered am I watching a Transformers movie? It took an hour and a half before anything really happened.What is with the music choices? My partner finally got sick of the weepy sickening dialogue and decided to find a playlist of *Most Brutal Drops* Dubstep mix. We found a good one and muted the actual movie rewound it a bit to get to where the dinosaurs appear. Then we hit play together and finally this movie was enjoyable. Hard hitting dubstep beats match up well with a dinosaur robot with Optimus Prime on top.. you know? Rather than oh I love you.. be brave.. survive and you will get laid twaddle.I am so sick of this kind of movie. It is boring unless we make it less boring ourselves. Right that is fair pay for a movie and it absolutely blows you.. not out of the water. No it just blows you back into your seat crushing you with its mediocrity.,Transformers - Age of Extinction
377,dave_maguire,Much better..!,8,6 July 2014,"I've been a fan of Transformers since I was a kid and was overjoyed when they released the first one, and I loved it. The second one I felt was the poorest of the films so far - a view I'm sure is shared by many, still my hopes were high for DOTM and, whilst it didn't tick all the boxes was a step in the right direction for the franchise. So with all the hype surrounding this film, along with the much anticipated inclusion of the Dinobots I got caught with the inner child in me and began to get excited about the film - and I have to say I was not disappointed!I won't type out the plot for you as I'm sure you'll be aware of it (The premise of ""Human have something that the transformers need"" is the same in this film as the rest) but I felt that basically cutting ties with the humans from the original trilogy was a great idea (there was only so many times you can hear ""BUMBLEBEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"" without getting a little annoyed). Also as we don't focus on the buddy relationship between Sam and Bumblebee in this film it allows us to get to know some of the additions to the autobot cast this time and get some sort of character development, even if it is only small, which we never had in the previous films and so never cared about any autobot other than Prime and Bumblebee, which was evident in this movie as when Ratchet is killed I can't say I was THAT sad about it.The CGI in the film was fantastic throughout, and the transformers look great, Optimus Prime is at his best in the film having finally had enough of saving humans but still being treated as a threat. I found the humans in the film were surprisingly all well acted throughout, even Kelsey Grammar looked quite evil during the movie - much moreso than Patrick Dempsey. Although I was confused at Stanley Tucci sudden which from Genius, billionaire businessman to comedy element halfway through the film??As for the bad guys in the film they were hit and miss as I had hoped of more from Galvatron after hearing he was in the movie, although after watching the film it is obvious that he is being foreshadowed as the villain in waiting. And after much was also made of ""Stinger"", and after the comical scene with Bumbebee I expected a better face-off against him at the endHowever I thought Lockdown was a great villain, the ruthless intergalactic bounty hunter has a great presence whenever he is on screen and frankly found him more menacing than Megatron has been in all the previous 3 movies; aside from tearing Jazz in half in the first film what else did he do except get his ass kicked? (Granted he did ""kill"" Optimus..!).And we can't have a review without mentioning the Dinobots really! I am torn between what to think about them as, on the one hand they all looked awesome and kicked some ass, but on the other hand I thought they were underused during the film – they're only in the film for about 10-15 minutes, and don't do much during that period. I felt that given how they were a major draw for this film they could've been in it more, or at least made more of a deal of during the film, if you miss one scene then you miss the only other reference to them in the whole movie.Don't get me wrong, the film is not flawless and has a few issues, but for me most have followed the trilogy so I don't see them changing much – things like, why transformers seem to disappear from the scene during battles – we had endless scenes like that in DOTM and there is one scene in this with Hound near the end which made me wonder whether the others had gone for an Engeron shake or something!? And also, robot dogs? WTF???? But probably the one that confuses me most is, if they are robots ""In Disguise"" maybe they shouldn't all turn in to brightly coloured supercars, especially since they are now being hunted, especially when we saw one transformer who could turn into a lady (A very beautiful lady)in Revenge of the Fallen. But again, since I gave it an 8 I'm not going to dwell on these too much; I didn't go watch this because I thought it would win Oscars! I'm very much looking forward to watching the next one to see how/when/where the story will take us!So in closing I would say, if you like Transformers then you will like this film. Don't base your decision on whether these reviews are good or bad, everyone had their own opinions- and they're all different!",Transformers - Age of Extinction

I'm 40 years old my first transformer was Soundwave. Gotta say i didn't love every cartoon as a kid but i like the story progression, which is how i see this film. People need to see a human story to connect so it must be a huge challenge to make a movie about robots. yeah there are lots of clichés but who cares! i didn't watch this film for a life changing or Shakespearean experience.

379,ccponds,"Not quite Oscar worthy. Then again, were you expecting it to be?",8,27 June 2014,"First off, my rating is really a 7.5ish rating; I just rounded it up.Michael Bay's fourth installment of the ""Transformers"" franchise is certainly going to split critics, fans, and casual movie goers alike. This mostly comes from the fact that ""Age of Extinction"" is VERY similar to other films by Michael Bay. And by this I mean extremely loud and extremely abundant explosions, at every possible moment. The funniest part of this is that Bay feels no shame in starting this at about the fifteen minute mark, and it does not stop until the films conclusion.For all its faults, and this film has a fair number of them, it is the first Transformers film where I actually do not want the humans to get stepped on (purposely or ""accidentally""). In truth, I actually liked the humans in this film, and cared about what happened to them. Mark Wahlberg's role is a generic father type character that has been seen dozens of times throughout the history of cinema. However, it is two large steps forward from Shia LaBeouf and his screaming throughout the entire film; ""BEE! BUMBLEBEE! OPTIMUS! AHH!"" Alongside Walhberg are Nicola Peltz and Jack Reynor. I felt Reynor's character was sort of bland, and although Peltz is obviously in this film to provide the ""hot"" female role, she gives a more believable performance than either Megan Fox or the blonde chick from ""Dark of the Moon."" The rest of the human characters try do the best they can with the script they are given, and sometimes it works and sometimes it does not. But for the most part, the humans were actually not the weak link in this film.Sadly, the weak link was actually the special effects. There were times where I was rolling my eyes at the CGI, or cringing at the ""Shaky-Cam"" that was added to a number of action shots. The robots in this movie sometimes appear far less real than they did in previous films, and this really needs to be touched up in later films.Of course, as I'm sure most of you can tell, this movie still focuses a bit too much on the humans. That being said, this film finally has every Autobot speaking and doing something on screen. This is very important, as the film series is called TRANSFORMERS. The characters I care about the most in this series are the Autobots, and one in particular; Optimus Prime. ""Age of Extinciton"" gives a new way of looking at the iconic leader, as his position is not 100% the same that we have seen in other films. Believe me when I say that there are some moments that you, as a movie goer, will be surprised by how characters, both human and Transformer, react to circumstances that surround them.All in all, ""Age of Extinction"" is by no means movie of the year, but it is a fun film. The story is muddled, like in previous films, but it is still a bit more cohesive and believable than, say, ""Dark of the Moon."" I personally felt that this was the best Transformer's film to date, but I know some people will disagree. It is a film that has some moments that truly deserve applause, and others that will anger the audience greatly. Nevertheless, this is a fun summer film. I would recommend seeing this film, but do not expect to it to be a picture perfect movie. If you are willing to let certain things go, I believe that most people will be able to find something fun in ""Age of Extinction.""",Transformers - Age of Extinction
380,tagheue,I have seen porno movies with better scripts...,4,25 October 2014,"Lets face it. This is a cash cow franchise. And it will be milked again. I can only imagine what this movie would have looked like in an IMAX theater. I bet, it was a visual orgasm. It should have been, since it was shot beautifully and like 60% of this entire movie is nothing but explosions, gunfire and building sized robots wrestle mania. And this being an almost 3 hours long flick, it means that the action alone lasted more than feature films now days. I give this to Michael Bay, he is the best director when it comes to epic scale, extinction level magnitutde action sequences. There is no contest. None. If only his involvement would have been restricted to just that, the action sequences. But no. Besides the hour and a half of mayhem, you also get about an hour worth of bad dialog, cheesy one-liners, dumb decisions made by people who supposed to be smart. Basically, you take a low quality Saturday morning cartoon that normally last only about 20 minutes max, stretch it out to last for 3 hours by adding in a bunch of subplots and characters that are more than unnecessary, and you got a movie. Ah, yeah, you also have about 20 minutes worth of story exposition, which is totally useless. The story is not in sync with the other 3 earlier installments, but honestly, who cares about that anyways? Stanley Tucci is enjoyable in this film. And the action looks spectacular.

Mainly Mark Wahlberg and his on-screen daughter, Nicola Peltz. Him as a scientist of sorts is ludicrous and she doesn't seem to understand that the daughter of a poverty stricken father really shouldn't look as if she walked onto the wrong set and should have ended up on Beverly Hills, 90210. Her full makeup at all times and ever-so short shorts, Rodeo Drive skinny jeans and mini skirts just can't make me forgive her lack of any ability. The only actor that seemed to be going to add something was killed off near the start of the film and the opening sequence that showed some promise just left us in limbo until I almost forgot that it had even happened. I guess this was to develop the characters of the main protagonists. Unfortunately that was a total waste of time. The special Fx and action scenes raised my rating from 1 to 3 out of 10 but they couldn't make the film any less bonkers than it was. I'm a fan of Michael Bay but I guess everyone can have an off day. I've avoided any major spoilers but really didn't need to bother as I couldn't spoil this movie.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

It has just been a steady downfall since the first movie, but they keep making them. Likely because they are profitable at the box office, which I can understand. I could've definitely gone without seeing this flick, just like the 3rd Transformers. (The second Transformers being the last one worth watching.) The worst part of this film was probably the cast, I didn't care for any member. And they don't fit either, the main character and his daughter look like they could be in a relationship. Yeah, Mark Walberg looks good for his age but in the film it made the relationship of father and daughter insincere and unbelievable for me. Usually in flicks where a parent in prepared to do anything to keep their child safe, it is compelling and exciting but in this movie I found myself not caring in the slightest about the daughters life. The special effects however are wonderful, as they are in each Transformers films, and it saves the feature a little bit. It's the type of movie you watch once for free when it comes on Netflix.

He is tacky, repetitive and loves to overdo most of his movies. He has done so many bad movies that is very easy to count his good one, believe me you wont need your second hand to count the good movies. That being said, if we are talking only on the transformer movies, this was way much better than 2nd and the 3rd. I don't understand all the hate about the movie. i thought the action was brilliant, they introduced a lot better actors than the previous installments. Lets talk about the pluses here, there's no Shia, there is no Tyrese, there is no Duhamel and no Ms Whiteley. Instead you got a cast of very mature actors. Negatives its a bit repetitive but so was the cartoon series and a bit long( but trust me the action makes up for it). One thing that makes this movie a lot better than the rest is the human contribution. Action bit are much more frequent and movie doesn't die in the end like the last two. Graphics were amazing, action was superb, story not bad and acting is very decent. I am not saying that it is the best action movie of the year, but if you are a transformers fan it is a must watch. Maybe it is because the last 2 were so bad that this felt very good. I don't know what people were expecting when they went to see the movie and seriously don't understand the hate. To be very honest this transformer was the best for me( may be I cant stand that little s**t Shia).

There is no more shia lebeouf, which is already promising. the action scenes are much better, with the ability to actually tell an autobot from a decepticon, and doesn't feel like two junkyards having sex. the explosions are pretty well rendered and do look good, and each one is shown clearly, unlike most bay movies. the racial and bodily humor is non existent in this movie,which was a relief, and I was actually expecting a lot of racist Chinese jokes in the third, but only got stereotypes, which weren't that bad.What about the actors? mark wahlberg was giving pretty much nothing in this movie, as if it was a contractual agreement. I was extremely disappointed in his performance, but it at least isn't as insufferable as shia. The camera oddly doesn't fixate on girls thighs that much, so that was a shocker. stanley tucci gives a pretty good performance and is a very likable character. There were only three comic reliefs, and lucas hopefully got killed off very quickly. I remember cheering when that happened. the autobots are actually pretty good, and I genuinely laughed at bumblebees antics.The action scenes were terrific, and I cheered when the dinobots showed up. Its giant robot dinosaurs! who cant like that?The only other thing I hate is how ridiculously long the movie is. It could have been wrapped up in two hours, maybe less, but it took 2 hours and 45 minutes. many scenes were utterly pointless. If the movie was shorter, I might have liked it more.all in all, its an okay movie, but I don't plan on ever watching it again.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
388,tictack,Nice entertainer,7,30 June 2014,"Latest edition of transformers is what anyone would generally expect from this franchise. humorous, glamorous (although lesser compared to what likes of Megan fox had to offer) and above all, Massive fights among transformers and humans. film is lengthy but entertaining throughout and there are no dull moments. the action sequences are not very different from earlier movies though still they fare very well against the recent mega creature movies like pacific Rim and Godzilla. its good to see machines in action and the size does not always matter. but there is too much action and destruction to the point at which one gets bored of it. apart from this, the run of the mill alien invasion, a genius scientist, mother-ship and attack on humans are also part of it which have been seen millions of times in sci-fi movies. Michael bay although has created a niche with this franchise with nice humor content and some emotional bonding between Machines and humans which make it in every transformer movie. an A Lister like Wahlberg makes it even better. is it better than previous editions?? cannot say but watchable and entertaining nonetheless.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

NO plot or story, ridiculous, repetitive dialog throughout, and just so much else wrong with it. I loved the last 2, not this one. I will say it was visually amazing, but thats all it was. Great special effects with no actual movie to hold it all together. ITs truly as if they didn't even try. Stunning visuals and graphics for sure, but you just need a plot also if you're going to make a movie, something Bay seems to forget pretty often. In this one, it went just way too far. Not even a near miss, he missed it by a mile. Im surprised Wahlburg signed onto this one, more surprised he didn't insist on tons of changes if he was going to stay in it once he realized what the film was going to be.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

The plot to me made more sense to me then the plot to the other movies. It made as much sense as the 2007 movie. The seed part not so much. I don't agree with the hate. If you like the other three then you might like this one. Lockdown was a pretty cool villan and the special affects were really good and vivid.,Transformers - Age of Extinction
391,kaundamabuya,The visual effects was the only thing that saved this movie,6,30 June 2014,"Saw Transformers: Age of Extinction yesterday and since then I have been thinking of what to make of the summer blockbuster. I am going to keep it short and simple with the pros and cons of the film. Pros- The visual effects of the film where outstanding and all the wow moments were in scenes that just had the autobots only especially the scenes involving Optimus Prime and the dinobots. Stanley Tucci and Mark Wahlberg gave tolerable performances. Cons- The film was way to lengthy and had too much going on making some points boring, the dialogs were terribly written and the performances by Jack Reynor and Nicola Peltz were razzie award worthy. It's like Michael Bay just picked these two of the street. I have never sen cardboard acting this bad. This script in my opinion didn't make sense....Why do I say this? Well it's kinda of hard to believe that humanity can be so dumb as to hunt and kill the autobots even after the events of Revenge of the fallen and Dark of the moon. After those two films you would think the humanity would be smart enough to acknowledge that they need the autobots and the autobots are heroes. Transformer: Age of Extinction is on par with Revenge of the Fallen when it should actually be better. If you loved the previous films then you can probably tolerate this one but honestly this is not a must watch film and I am a huge Michael Bay fan so for me to say this means something. Final con is the cast change really ruins the film. The old cast could really act. They grabbed your attention. Shia Labeouf in all honesty owned the franchise. We need him back along with Tyrese Gibson, John Duhamel and John Turturro....Even Megan Fox.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
392,Everything_PopCulture,"While not perfect, it gets the closest to what a Transformers film should be",6,27 June 2014,"Age of Extinction takes viewers five years after the battle of Chicago in Dark of the Moon. It presents a new human protagonist, Cade Yaegar, as well as returning Optimus Prime and Bumblebee. The plot: Humans have hired Transforming Bounty Hunters to hunt down remaining Decepticons and Autobots on Earth while they try to build their own Transformers to eventually take over the job. Let's start by saying, this isn't a perfect film, far from it. What a Transformers film should be is it needs the main character to be Optimus Prime. It needs to be 90% transformer screen time and 10% everything else. A transformers film should have fighting robots, a plot that entirely centers around the Autobots and Decepticons. The problem with the Michael Bay films is they are human centric and have very little screen time for the Transformers. Age of Extinction is ultimately the best of the Transformers films as it focuses much more on the Transformers than in the previous films. They are given more screen time and this is what we Transformers fans want. Optimus Prime is the main transformer in this film, which is great, a factor that has been lacking in the previous 3 films where arguably Bumblebee is the main transformer. Optimus finally manages to fit his leadership role in this film, not to mention we see his G1 truck and robot form, although rusted, at the films beginning. While we are introduced to new autobots who you think we wouldn't care about, surprisingly you care about them more than you think you would. Hound, voiced by John Goodman, is one of the new autobots who manages to stamp himself as a cool character, who really should just have been called Bulkhead for a shout out to fans of the show. Bumblebee's role is minor compared to his role in the previous 3, which I like as more screen time is given to Optimus. Mark Wahlberg is a better actor to have than Shia Labeouf, hands down. Mark's character actually gets involved in the war of the transformers and doesn't just run around screaming like Shia did. He helps fight which I believe is an improvement on the human side of the story. The bounty hunter transformer named Lockdown is amazing. His appearance is bad ass, his voice perfect and his role is probably the second best in the movie with Optimus being first. Ultimately what we get from the Transformers in this film is what Transformers fans want. Solid robot fighting. Optimus finally fills his leadership role. The human story is a bit dull, however I appreciate that when the humans are on screen they are actually a part of the transformers story, unlike Shia in Revenge of the Fallen when that film was all him and nothing else. The third act battle is the best of all the transformer films. We get a lot more screen time for the Transformers, which is all we ask for. There are bad things in this film, most I'll let you find yourself, but a thankful death of a comedic relief character was well needed and well received within the first act of the film.Overall Age of Extinction is a solid good time for entertainment, it's the closest we have got to a transformers film fans actually want and it's the best of the films so far.It's gotten very bad reviews however I think critics have overlooked the fact that the Transformers have much more screen time, the human characters are more involved AND Optimus Prime is finally who Optimus Prime should be, leader of the Autobots and main Transformer.7/10",Transformers - Age of Extinction
393,bombadil-esquire,A bad movie,2,25 August 2015,"The single epic or awesome element/part/thing about Transformers: Age of Extinction is Grimlock. Notably, his transformation into T- Rex-Dragon. And....I guess one could commend the quality of the color. Aaaand I suppose Lockdown is cool looking.IF you are set on watching movie that is simply set on action and video-game style robot-and-human fight sequences, this movie isn't unfitting. But for every other aspect of movie-watching, this film is not only the worst of this series, having the least action and the least cool Decepticons, it doesn't even deserve to have been a feature film; no matter how convincing all the promo poster pictures look.The romance circumstance (Cade, his daughter, and her boyfriend) is just as eyerollworthy as that of RotF and DotM, the comic-relief- business-government role, i.e. Tucci's character, is boring compared to Tuturro's and Malkovich's.And, though Dark of the Moon holds the trophy of dumbest plan of the arch-antagonist (""bringing Cybertron to Earth""), Age of Extinction has no intriguing conflict. The Fallen did, Megatron did (simply killing Optimus), but Galvatron is reduced to a silly Disney-villain whiner come the point where his plan fails. Apart from the perfect CGI, which excludes the stupid robot blood and the seed-transforming, this movie is completely without actual Transformers finesse.Want to see some good-old Transformers action robot fun? Watch the first three movies.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
394,paulinairawanzhao,Not very good,6,2 July 2014,"I give 6 for the sake of Transformers (2017) and the CGI. This 2014 version has very complicated and confusing story line. Not suitable for a cartoon adapted movie. My 8 year old son started to feel sleepy when the auto-bots gone to China and Hongkong and went to tame the dinosaur-bots, which came out of nowhere. SMH. It is a very long movie with roller coaster story line.. and the scenes inside Lockdown spaceship I think were just not necessary, it bores me down. And also, who Lockdown was? He came out in the middle of nowhere and in the mission of capturing Optimus Prime? I mean, the kids don't know what's going on either. If you were going to create a new character for the story, at least give the viewers some footage about who the great Lockdown was.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
395,jakob-berge,Some badass action sequences covered in an lacklustre story,5,18 October 2020,"Age of Extinction (2014) is a sort of a soft reboot of the continuing series. I have an genuine affection towards the Transformers movies, they are sort of my guilty pleasure films. Even though I have mixed feelings towards this movie, I've got to say this is the worst of the Bayformers for me.With an entire new human cast, the plot is still much of the same. The story is very lacklustre and formulaic. You know how this movie is starting introducing the characters, the gonzo weirdness happining in the middle with a bunch of exposition, and the explosion packed last act with lastly Optimus Prime delivering a speech written straight out of Shakespeare. The fault I place at Ehren Kruger who wrote the screenplay solely for himself, and I don't get why Paramount or the producers didn't look for a better one. Also the script who is otherwise very self-serious and grave still find place to some parody of itself. An old cinema owner in Texas talk about the new movies coming out just being bad sequels and remakes.The acting is not good, Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) is the cliche american single-dad hero living on a farm in Texas. He has some interesting thing going on in the start when he shows his inventor skills and meeting Optimus Prime, but then he have to share screentime with his uninteresting daughter Tessa (Nicola Peltz) and has some excruciating jabs with her racing car boyfriend Shane (Jack Reynor). The movie is going for a more darker and gritty version this time. That is mostly clear with the bad guys. In the lead we have Attinger( soullesly played by Kelsey Grammer) and the laughably tough guy with a dark cape and glasses James Savoy (Titus Welliver). Stanley Tucci is the best part out of all the characters, and it was hilarious how he just went totally out of his character in Hong Kong and yelled at every thing happening. For our robot friends we thankfully got some cleaner designs and new characters with a distinctive personality (My favourite Hound voiced by John Goodman). And Galvatron is outshadowed by a much more compelling villain in Lockdown. His subplot with Optimus Prime should have had a much bigger role. It has to be said that this movie follows the trend by the one before of being way more violent and aggressive than its predecessor. Especially the heroic leader Optimus Prime just seems pissed the whole movie for being stucked with these pitty and tiny humans.We don't come for the Transformers movies for the plot but for the awesome action as many have pointed out. And to finish my positive feelings towards this movie, the action is good. Some highlights are the prologue, which shows how the dinosaurs was eradicated . An aerial battle in Chicago, and the last 20 mins when the dinobots finally show up. This movie lasts 2hr45mins which is obviously too long. The pure raw destruction we see in the last 20 mins are delightful, with Optimus riding Grimlock and a giant spaceship sucking up everything consisting of metal. The action choreography is an improvement, especially seen in the 1v1 fights between the robots. It is way easier seeing who is who than the first movies rapid editing. The visuals are a bit uneven but mostly good. It looks more shiny and clear especially on the transformers. But some probably unfinished scenes, contains a blurred background that are easily notable. Also the new transformation pixel thingy looks horrible. The technical achievements have always been top-notch in Transformers, and the score by Steve Jablonsky is both emotional and earth shattering. Other flaws in this movie is the over abundance of product placement. Bay don't care anymore. He just shows an entire scene revolving around Marky-Mark drinking a bud-light and threatening a random citizen. Then in the last act we just travel to China for no apparant reason (Galvatron literally says, ""Get the seed to the largest city"" Hong Kong really?) than to please the asian market, and if you look at the global box office it was a success. This earned over 1 billion dollars. Critics can rave negatively all they want but this franchise clearly shows that if the audience shows up nothing else matters.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

It was a visually stunning experience, with great 3D. It was something other than the old Autobot, Decepticon rivalry. The only issue with the movie was technically an issue with the audience, who are used to Hollywood movies being 90-120 min long at max, and this is 165 min. But it had to be, it was covering all the aspects including Autobot human relations and how they had worsened over time, and how Mark tries to salvage it. Prime is quite unpleased off during the entire movie which might have put off some people, but if you think about it, he has every right to be! I personally loved it!!

There are a lot of unexplained things in the movie as well which will become the cause of creation of the next movie(for example : who had sent lock down in the first place) .The plot as a whole is not coherent and takes unexpected turns as the movie goes along. perhaps a less complicated script and more meanings and reasons were to be added. Hongkong is not displayed properly. I would also say that it bears a lot of resemblance to the first movie that came out in 2007.

That's why I abandoned this saga years ago.Recently, on an unoccupied afternoon, I decided to give it another chance with this one and I've regretted ever since! This should-not-be-called-a-film is nothing more than a series of CGI put into a non-sense plot. It's so stupid and illogical that at some point, I just kept fast-forwarding to watch the next CGI robot battle, hoping to finally get some fun out of it. But no, in the end, the only thing that I had was just a headache, and I was so mad with myself for losing my time on this garbage.And to Box-Office-killer Mr Bay, as he will no doubt continue with his style (and make more and more money...), I really hope that he can give more ""brain"" into his future products. No offence, cause I, too, am a fan of good CGI, and a just-very-simple plot could be fine in this type of film.

The script is definitely the worst thing about the movie because at some points your not sure it's a comedic part or trying to be serious.

406,KrazydeBug,Biggest disappointment of Transformers,2,11 July 2014,"I like transformers. I've been a fan since I watched a very early, cheap-made cartoon of transformers, ahhh, 20 years ago. I watched all previous movies and I loved and disliked them. But boy, this one is a whole new world. I am totally disappointed after sitting 3 hours in the theater. I only felt better because I didn't spend more money on IMAX/3D because my little daughter didn't like 3D glasses...Anyway, first of all, it is WAY-TOO-LONG. I am OK with long movies. Gone with wind, Titanic, .... But they actually HAVE stories. This one, it's more like someone spending 3 hours to tell you a five-page baby- book. There is no story, period.OK, there is some story. Human doesn't like a superior species living next door. So they went out and tried to kill all Autobots. And they are succeeding with some help from some ET-bounty-hunter. And human is building our own transformers, which they think they can control. Of course things turns out not the way they are planned to be. Man-made transformers rebelled; Autobots fights back (to both human and bad-man- made-bots); Optimus Prime gets his ass kicked again, and some I'll- never-let-you-hold-my-daughter's-hand-punk did something heroic (or maybe not), and O.P. defeated villain boss. There. That's the whole story. Imagine you sitting in dark for 165 minutes just to get this story.I'm also OK with bland, no taste, stupid movies sometimes, if the visual and sound are astonishing. You'd think this T4 movie would be one. You'll be disappointed. The ""transformation"" is just getting too messy. You can't really see a clear ""transforming"". Instead, there is just this blurry fast ki-ki-ka-ka with all parts deforming and moving and there they changed! Especially those dinosaur things. You feel they are just continuously turning inside out or backside up and a dinosaur comes out. It has no sense of ""WOW"".I'm not gonna get to the ""brand-showing hidden commercials"" stuff that became too obvious since last few movies. But it was one of the little fun I had when watching the movie. It went: ""hahaha, there's one!"".And there are just some pieces doesn't fit in the story. One being, no matter what alien masters did millions of years ago (spoiler: they used some kind of bomb, named ""seed"", to turn organic life into a special metal they used to build all the transformers), there should be no hint left for human to figure it out. And this human hi-tech company is helping the bounty hunter to get to Optimus Prime, with conditions that this bounty hunter will give them one ""seed"" so they can do the same to create such metal. Whaaa? Yeah, dumb-ass, but I guess there are bad people. The thing I can't comprehend is, how did human get to know existence and functions of this ""seed""? That's OK. They may get this information from the bounty hunter, which in that movie exhibited a lot of disgust towards human beings (so I don't know why he'd tell human about this...). Anyway, so this company needs this seed to make the metal, to make transformers. That's why they are so enthusiastic about helping the bounty hunter. In other words, without this metal, they can't make transformers. Oh No. That's not true. This company has already found some very rare metal on earth, that is unstable, cannot be used anywhere. But programmable. They harvest some, made some white balls (programmed) and can break up into small cubes and reform into anything human wants. Sort of like the liquid robots in terminators. Wait, wait... If you have this metal already, WHY do you need the seed? Anyway, they made a squadron of transformers using this metal. Now try to remember the I-do-not-die ability of liquid T-1000 terminator. And these man-made robots rebelled and went out to rob the seed from human. Now, Autobots of course will try to stop them. And they fight. And you can see Megatron (revived by stupid human) breaking up and reforming and breaking up and reforming just like the T-1000. But not other man-made robots. They will shatter and die with a bullet in their head. Hmmmm. I am not sure. BTW, if you are a fight-scene fan, you'll not like the fight scenes in this movie. Because you cannot tell who is fighting who.And the ending of this story is, Optimus Prime took the seed, without changing into any vehicles/ships/planes, just lit some rocket-propellers on his feet and flew into deep space (so any other bounty hunters will not go to earth and destroy our home because of him). I was just wondering, since when Autobots became capable of flying like that? If they can fly all the time, why the heck did they turn into cars and scrabbled on highways when they needed to get to some places ASAP?I had to give this movie a two star because I actually spent money watching it.

408,rctguy75,Bring New Life to the Franchise? EPIC FAIL!!!,3,2 February 2017,"Ever since the perfectly fun first movie, the Transformers franchise has gone downhill extremely fast. This film was Michael Bay's attempt to resurrect the series. While I didn't see this film in the theater, I still had a small amount of hope for the movie. Watched it on TV and, holy mackerel, this movie was HORRIBLE!!!In my opinion, after this ATROCITY, the series is all but dead. Let's dive into this masterpiece of failure.The story of the film is that the Transformers are now being hunted down. Apparently, a new Bounty Hunter has taken control of the humans trust, and the Autobots are in dire need of help. Ironically, Optimus Prime turns to mechanic Cade Yeager, played by Mark Wahlberg, his daughter Tessa, played by Nicola Peltz, and her boyfriend. The story of the film is okay, but the writing and dialogue is about average. The characters are either hit or miss. The only characters I like are Cade Yeager and a new Transformer played by John Goodman. Most of the new characters are awful. As is the fact that only Bumblebee and Optimus are the only returning classic Transformers. The new ones are very unforgettable.One of the biggest negatives I had with the movie comes down to anticipation. Specifically, my anticipation to see the Dinobots in action. This was DESTROYED! The Dinobots are only in the last 30 minutes of this almost 3 HOUR MOVIE! That's right, the movie is almost 3 HOURS LONG! All the movie is is explosions, CGI, and Michael Bay stereotypes jammed down our throat! I didn't like it at all.In conclusion, Transformers Age of Extinction is an absolute waste of time! The characters are unforgettable, the story is average, and the special effects are unbearable, as the film is trying to rely on explosions and CGI. If you're going to watch a Transformers movie, only watch the first movie. That is a legitimately great movie. This film, while not the worst (that is Revenge of the Fallen), is still VERY VERY BAD!!! Transformers Age of Extinction gets a 4/10! Nothing will convince me that Transformers The Last Knight will be good!",Transformers - Age of Extinction

It becomes very obvious this is all product placement and pandering up to audiences in China. And worse, a large portion of the movie us a discussion about underage sex and trying to normalize it. Why? We want to see an action movie with dinorobot's and not some sexual fantasies from the director. Also the end is completely unbelievable: the evil robot owns Optimus and the other Autobots but then 3 humans step in and kick the robot's ass.

A new menace and foe is introduced, as if the decepticons hadn't bern enough.A colorful portrait of greedy capitalists and misunderstood patriotism blends well with the storyline.New visuals add more soul and character of our beloved Transformers, who in previous movies have been stale and one-dimensional. Should you know the original cartoons, you will also rejoice with the addition of much beloved Autobot allies.Changing the primary cast from nauseating Shia LaBeouf to Mark Wahlberg and Kelsey Grammer has added significant depth to the characters although Michael Bay persists in exagerated use of emotional clichésAge of Extinction holds a darker and deeper story than the previous editions, and comes with a hearty recomendation....",Transformers - Age of Extinction
412,nvxx2004,A bit too much if you have watched the previous ones,6,13 July 2014,"One knows what to expect from Transformers and fourth movie delivers that. Action packed, epic scenes are still fun to watch, but it began to pall. Yes, we have Dinobots this time, yes, we have plot twists, that imply Transformers universe is much bigger and lay foundation for further installments, albeit still feels the same.Although I've voted with my wallet for an imax showing and will do for upcoming installments, I'd rather have the fourth transformers (or at least next ones coming) a bit different - more transformer-centric and less human relationships.Can't agree that Wahlberg is a sure winner over LaBeouf, he is more fit for an action movie, but his action scenes are definitely not the most fun part to watch and less impressive than Duhamel's portion in the Dark of the Moon. But still, this is a welcomed change.Worth watching anyways. Better in imax (imax scenes look really impressive). But still, Transformer movies can be much better...",Transformers - Age of Extinction
413,livyatnair,A bit disappointing,7,12 August 2014,"I've been a huge Transformers fan, ever since the first one came out. Unfortunately, this movie was a bit of a let down. The characters (Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and Lockdown) are still great. And the graphics are still mind boggling. Especially some scenes of Lockdown's fighting with Optimus Prime are a real treat. However, the storyline is a bit weak and the new characters (humans) don't give this movie the same zing as the earlier ones. Also, the back-story of Lockdown is a bit weak not coming through very clearly in the movie. Mark Wahlberg plays the part of an out of work and down on his luck inventor, reasonably well. However, they could have done better with the casting of his daughter. She can't act at all and she just doesn't bring out any sense of kinship with Mark Wahlberg! Overall, quite disappointing-but a good watch for the graphics and the bots.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
414,rix_1000,Age of Transformers,8,3 July 2014,"I feel like I should make myself heard in this case, because of all the hate this movie is getting through reviews. I am a big Michael Bay and Transformers fan. I loved the original characters from the first movie, especially Sam and Mikaela, also Epps and Lennox. I did miss them and think that at some point, they should go back to these characters. That being said, I understand and accept that the franchise had to be taken towards a new direction. I loved the first Transformers movie, which had quite a long introduction to it. It started off with the bond between a man and his car. In AoE they reintroduced this theme, as Cade being a down on his luck robotics engineer and searching for something to sink his teeth into. I loved that in this movie they sort of went back to it and started the movie off slowly and easing in to the transforming part. Cade and Optimus were meant to find and help each other. And when the transformation part finally got there, it was glorious. The CGI was better than ever and even the 3D was amazing. The actors and the characters were not ideal in my opinion, but they did a decent job and I would like to see them return in the sequel. To all the haters out there, I must say this... This is a Transformers movie. Explosions, slow-mo, heavy CGI battles is what makes this our guilty pleasure and why we enjoy it so much. This installation of Transformers was an amazing new take that will definitely broaden the storytelling universe and take us out deeper into the unexplored space (hopefully). All-in-all it was an awesome adventure of a movie with lots of metal clinking CGI battles. I loved it and hope they will make plenty more. It is exactly like Michael Bay said, ""People walked out happy, that's what we're trying to do. We're just entertainers."" And oh so entertaining it was!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
415,donnajpierce,Just getting worse...,4,29 August 2014,"Transformers was a great film. it introduced us to something we'd never really seen before as an audience: giant CGI robots fighting each other. it would be later used in other movies... A LOT of other movies... Anyway, back then we loved it. The Revenge of the Fallen? My goodness what a GIANT STEP BACKWARD! You really couldn't get worse than that. The third one, I WILL admit was about a baby step forward.You remember how i said you couldn't get worse than TF2? I guess YOU CANIt was the SAME THING AS THE FIRST! Big robots, big boobies, knockout women, stereotypes, your typical Bay movie. Well, this time we have, Mark Wahlberg, Stan Tucci, Kelsie Grammar, and... um... that girl from The Last Airbender?

416,Honkmeister83,Mindless,1,13 July 2014,"This is one of the worst Michael Bay movies yet.It never stops, it taught i was going insane... just mindless action with almost no breathers.Escapism at its worst.Tough if you like a confused plot, bad performances, disgusting monologue, horrible mindless action, horrible comedy, really bad timing, terrible editing and getting your energy sucked out slowly and brutally during what feels like eons... Then by all means, go waste your money.This is not a tribute to Transformers. It's a hymn to the mindless, and shallow escapism which has boomed in Hollywood the last 20 years with the coming of the digital era(Even tough there are good digital movies).

417,dpickett93,Michael Bay Got Me This Time,7,2 July 2014,"The saying goes ""Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me"". I don't think it says anything about being fooled a third or fourth time. After being fooled more than two times something must be wrong. I only gave this film a 7 solely based on it's action, an there was a ton of action. The only thing this film might get an Oscar for is sound editing because my God at one point I thought the sound editors were just being funny with this super deep declining tone. It was still cool though. My problem is this film was expected. Who comes out of a Michael Bay film saying ""Man that was beautifully written"". He is an action guy if he just so happens to grab a good writer (which you would think he would) along for the ride it would be out of pure luck of the draw. It's okay, not great at all, the action is what makes the entire movie have what little bit of life it does have. It is watchable though unlike (in my opinion) ""A Good Day To Die Hard"". Could have been taking down some as far as how long it is, I mean 2hrs & 45mins. I love long films. I feel like with a long film you have been on this long journey with the characters. The story has been embedded into your mind and you think about it for awhile. I would let long films pass if it was Oscar season and popular franchises (which I guess this would count as one but we were fooled and it should never happen again!). To make a long review short. Great for kids 13 to 15 because their little teenage brains would jump for joy with all that 2hr and 45min action. Oh and Michael Bay this is the last time you fool me...again",Transformers - Age of Extinction
418,tkchess,Negative reviewers prob had super high expectations,7,21 July 2014,"I went in with no expectations. Sure, I knew about the DinoBots, but I wasn't expecting anything with regards to them. Everything else was unexpected. Galvatron, the seed, Kelsey Grammar...everything was news to me.Were there problems? Sure. Was it a bad movie? No. It does the job. I enjoyed it. Explosions, mild comedy, John Goodman.The 2.75 hours went by quick because it was gripping. I thought John Goodman stole the show. He did some really good voice acting - took me a while to figure it out. People are upset that they changed the human- support cast, but I must say, it is a breath of fresh air not having Shia LeBouf screaming ""OPTIMUS"" every five minutes, or a girl yelling ""SAM"" every chance she can get. Someone commented about the girl yelling ""DAD"" too much. I didn't find it a problem - I've heard worse.Someone commented about the comedy not being up to par, or being stupid and cheesy. Frankly, I think the comedy was just right. It wasn't cheesy, nor was it wasn't the main focus as it was in Transformers 2. Perhaps I am a bit biased since I love Mark Wahlberg and he makes the majority of the jokes in the movie. And, I love Stanley Tucci, who makes his fair share of jokes. The #1 joke (which probably was not well- received by conservative viewers) came from the Transformer Brains who, when asked about the slave work he was performing, comments that he is doing all of his work in the absence of union benefits.The major problem with the movie are plot holes that either go unexplained, or they are explained well later into the movie. But other than that, it is an enjoyable movie.***SPOILERS*** So, very early in the movie, Stanley Tucci's character's subordinate discovers a fossilized dinobot, and she returns to Stanley's character all excited, talking about how this could upend history as they know it. I.e. an asteroid didn't wipe out the dinosaurs. Well, that is the last we hear of the dinobots until they are summoned towards the end of the movie. What did the dinobots have to do with anything, especially since the story is that the creator-transformers were just burning the earth and its biological non-transformer lifeforms to a crisp with their seeds to create transformeron (transformer metal)?The dinobots just appear out of nowhere. Optimus saves one of them, but then four appear in total? They are pretty big too, so what the hell? Where were they hiding? All on that small ship? It wasn't like they had any relevance either. The creators were killing earth-born organisms, not dinobots.So, John Goodman's character and Bumblebee can run out of ammo, but Mark Wahlberg's transformer-gun doesn't run out?Chicago was ridiculously destroyed, but in 5 years it is back to how we know it today?So, when hunting down the transformers the CIA agents can read heat signatures with IR and the sort, but when searching for Optimus in the barn they can't see a single signature and act like nothing is there?Mark Wahlberg is able to repair Optimus, with advanced circuitry, in a matter of a couple hours before the CIA arrives?I don't understand why the CIA cares about Mark Wahlberg, his daughter and her boyfriend. Kelsey Grammar's character is worried they will go to the press and leak info about how KSI is melting down auto-bots to make their own transformers. So what, big deal. Who is going to believe them, and with what evidence?How many different damn stories about the birth of Transformers are there? In Transformers 1, it is about the all-spark that can create a live robots from metal. In Transformers 2, it is about the existence of Energon from the Sun which gives life to the Transformers. Now in this movie we learn of creator-Transformers that create Transformeron from biological matter. So...which is it? How do you arrange those three creation events? And where do dinobots fit in that?So...Jetfire (from Transformers 2) is an old and busted unit that is falling apart. The Dinobots are millions of years old and act like they were built yesterday. So...do Transformers actually age, or not?",Transformers - Age of Extinction
419,johntomccarty,Great movie,10,17 October 2014,"his was the best Transformers movie that I have seen yet!I am sorry now that I missed seeing it on the big screen this past Summer. It is loaded with great action scenes galore, interesting characters,and what we all come mostly to watch these kinds of movies for,the Transformers robots themselves.It is also one of the best 3D movies that I have ever seen.

John Goodman voicing Hound was a real treat also.I highly recommend this movie for all Transformers and 3D movie fans alike.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

421,darrelltill,"Far from perfect, but possibly the best Transformers movie.",7,10 July 2014,"There is a lot to dislike about the Transformers series of movies, if you want to be critical. In my opinion the scripts are brainless, the actors are terrible, the casting and portrayal of women is downright sexist, the action scenes with the robots are almost impossible to follow, and there is far too much ""human interest"" in the films when they should be about the Transformers themselves.SOME of these points were not as bad in Transformers 4: Age of Extinction.The script is better than some previous outings, but still corny in a lot of places. And we are spoonfed the story... man who knows about robotics finds a dusty old truck... I wonder what is going to happen next? And there are a couple of shocking stereotypes in the form of a comedy stoner friend, and later on a flamboyant billionaire. But the young blonde isn't in the film for that much of the time and she isn't portrayed in a sexist way. She's just annoying. Once again the story is really about the humans who come into contact with the Transformers which is a shame because it would be great to see the film focus on the robots as main characters.The robot fight scenes still occasionally look like Michael Bay has thrown a bag of spanners into the air and filmed them falling down in slow motion, but it did seem toned down somewhat this time around. There were more shots of the robots standing in all their glory, as opposed to previous films where you were lucky if they stayed still for a split second, or you saw an eye filling the screen. Another improvement is that the film focuses on a smaller number of Transformer characters.There are a few new 'concepts' for the Transformers in the film which helped keep my interest. Also, if you are a fanboy.... Dinobots!So overall I'm giving this film a good score, because while I don't believe in ""popcorn"" movies, and a film is never ""so bad it's good"", I genuinely thought that while you don't need brain cells into the double figures to enjoy this film there was a lot to like; and for those of us that keep going back to the cinema only to watch the series because of 1980s nostalgia, it is good to see a step in the right direction.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
422,arvindsasikumar921,3 times a charm...now the 4th?,4,10 July 2014,"The trailer made the film look promising. Bringing in Mark Wahlberg heightened the hopes. The director stayed the same. I told to myself - so what? He has had 3 bad movies (of the same franchise) in a row, so what? This one might be better! He has a better cast, a promising plot, good graphic designers; so I decided to give it another shot. Though I went into the theaters with a renewed hope, I came out cursing myself for having to sit through the decimation of the transformers franchise. 3 times a charm...but the 4th?Tranformers: The Age of Extinction is a complete disaster. The movie has nothing to offer - no good script, no proper plot development and above all, with all the resources in the world, one of the worst directions. All through the movie, there are either things blowing up or some completely unnecessary romantic scenes. For instance major fight is going on in the background at the end and the actors are making out!? I would also point out what many people already think about this movie series - A transformers movie must concentrate on transformers (or at least more on transformers) but in this case, the transformers are just the fighting machines. We get a very small glimpse of their back story, emotions and internal struggles. Also, again in this movie (like the previous ones), we have a hot chick helplessly running around the screen. Simply put, it was horrible.The only eye opener (and the only thing that still kept me in my seat) were the graphics which were pretty good. The 3d was good too. But this time, where was the transforming? Most of what we got to see were some cubes (of transformium) floating around in space and merging to become a standing robot! This is worse in a way that at least in the previous movies, we got to actually see how the cars turned into robots, making the movie even less worth seeing. It was a good idea to bring in Mark Wahlberg, but even he couldn't save the film with the crappy direction.Ususally people say don't watch this movie in the theaters, watch it on DVD or something. I'd say the opposite - if you have to watch it, watch it in theaters in 3D, because other than the graphics and the special effects, there is nothing else worthwhile to be seen. Michael Bay is lucky to be directing a popular franchise that he can capitalize on just using the name, no matter how crappy he makes the films. I am just sad that this will most probably turn out to be the most earning film of the year (even one of the most all time maybe) and the fact that I have contributed to it getting this position makes me sadder. If the transformers franchise would just decide to throw out Bay and replace him with someone else (anyone for that matter, this movie cannot be made any worse in terms of direction), you would have a much much much better movie to offer the fans.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
423,basildonboroughfc-53-110251,A sequel too far,5,14 July 2014,"I was really looking forward to this film, I have all the others on DVD and enjoyed them. I was left disappointed.The casting was quite good and at least one of the annoying/eccentric 'comic' characters was killed off early on.The film was far too long, there were several very boring and completely pointless scenes.The special affects were top quality for most of the film, though several of the fight sequences were difficult to follow because the scene moved around rather than focused on what was happening.There seemed to be a huge amount of product placement throughout the film, and not just for the vehicles.For a film with such an allegedly high budget I would expect a far better film. I'm sure the new Transformer designs and characters will make a fortune for the franchise and, unfortunately, go some way to encouraging backers for the next films, which was set-up at the end of this film.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
424,idontdodrugs,"165mins of awesome visuals - no story, no interesting characters, nothing else though",3,19 September 2014,"I cannot even summarize the setup for the movie. It's pretty much incoherent rubbish. So we have Marky Mark there, who delivers pretty much your typical Marky Mark performance, as an INVENTOR type of guy with no money. We have a daughter, that is - Bayification alert - gorgeous and has for the entirety of the movie perfect pink lush lipstick on. We have her boyfriend, an Irish wannabe, that is a very annoying character without purpose other than make Marky Mark angry. These characters are supposed to be the emotional core of the movie. However, never, during the whole 165 minutes, you care at all for them. And of course, we have the Autobots with Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, and others. Well, they are the same as in the other movies, with new designs. You also have some new Transformers making an appearance, which is visually interesting, but does not constitute to a somewhat interesting, sensemaking, or logical plot.The plot is convoluted without measures. You have no idea why any of the ""vilians"" do what they do. There is a macguffin again, there is some mentioning of a higher power that created the autobots, there is government conspiracy again, there is an industry guy that wants to make a profit. Plot holes over and over - do not engage your brain in following the story, only use your occipital lobe for the visuals. Indeed, the film feels like a ride on an amusement park. You watch people stumble from one set piece to another. Why they do that, is not important. The visuals are striking. The amount of detail in the action shots with stuff exploding, autobots crashing, buildings crumbling, and dinobots fighting is impressive. Add a few fanservice shots of the daughter in lovely sunlight and numerous hero posture shots for Marky Mark, and the visuals are nothing really to complain (except maybe a car jump scene pretty much at the beginning....I think physics were not well portrayed here). Nevertheless, the action feels plumb, it has no weight, and the fact that the movie stumbles from one action scene to another, kind of weighs you out. You even get tired of the action. Given all these problems, I am not sure for who I can recommend this. if you like CGI and robots, and can draw your entire enjoyment from astonishing visuals, go for it. If you want to spent your time in any case with a purpose, do not. There are other summer blockbusters that plainly deliver something, instead of pretty much nothing.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

I went to see this because I have seen the other films and this was the only film starting at the time I got to the theater. It ran FAR too long. Just when I thought it was ending...there was an hour more to go! There were too many different plots going on to really follow. Michael Bay should have spent that extra hour explaining more. This was disappointing. Without Mark Wahlberg and Stanley Tucci, I would have left half way through. Save your money. Rent this instead of seeing it in the movies. I wish I had read some reviews before I wasted my money. Oh well. Not the worst movie I've seen this year.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
426,OrangeFlamingo,No.,4,27 June 2014,"I'm so glad I wasn't the only person who thinks that this movie is on the brink of an epic failure. What did I just watch? It is such a clusterf*ck of so many things, you're not even sure what dimension you're in.The first thing that will become clear to you is how awful the script is. I don't think any effort at all was put into writing it. 77% of the time someone opened their mouth, I wanted to slit my own throat. ""You don't have a warrant to search this property"" ""...My face is the warrant""^That is an actual line from this movie. I could not make that up. And it's supposed to be taken seriously. Also;""I'm not here to help you find your daughter, you're here to help me find my girlfriend""Really dude? I'm so sure that the entire time you're battling alien robot dogs, you're girlfriends dad is thinking ""I GOTTA help this guy get his girlfriend back, so they can live happily ever after"" and not ""Holy sh*t, I NEED TO SAVE MY F*CKIN DAUGHTER""There's a scene later on in the movie where wahlberg comes crashing down on some guys car, COMPLETELY destroying it, and yes, although this guy just avoided death by inches, this other guy miraculously fell out of the sky onto his car, the city around him is in shambles, there GIANT F*CKING ROBOTS battling all around him thus further destroying the city, he says to wahlberg ""You better have insurance!"" Take me now, Jesus. The ONLY character I enjoyed (other than Mark Wahlberg because you could tell he was trying to make this disaster work) was T.J. Miller's character, Lucas. He pulled off being an idiot pretty well. Don't get me wrong, his lines were no better than anyone else's, but he was pretty much the only person who fit the character he/she was given. Nicola Peltz, who plays Wahlberg's daughter Tessa, is clearly there for the sexual enticement, is she a wholesome country girl or is she trying to be the next big name playboy model? Titus Welliver, the dude who comes to their house trying to arrest them or whatevs, is he an FBI agent or is he the rejected Anderson from the matrix? But the person with the biggest identity crisis is Tessa's boyfriend, Shane. Is he irish? Is he trying to be Seth Rogen? Is he a bad ass? Or is he a whiny little pansy? The world may never know.This movie is basically a cinematic magazine/supermarket ad. I remember the brands of food and clothing that were thrown in my face more than what this movie was actually even about. Which I guess is kind of the point, so good job with that. While we're somewhat on the subject of the plot, you don't know what it is, until like the last 40 minutes. If you even want to call it a plot. Suddenly, all within about 10 minutes, you learn the autobots are trying to retrieve this nuke-type bomb that will turn an entire city into the metal they're made from so they can build more and take over the world, and the humans must prevent them from doing so. Why didn't someone just say that in the first place and save the first hour and a half of complete nonsense? That being said, You can save yourself some time in the beginning by looking up a quick synopsis of about the first hour and a half of the movie, and then fast forwarding to where said synopsis leaves off. You wont miss a whole lot. This movie was way too long. I checked the time at what was 8:20 and almost shed a tear because I still had an hour and a half left to sit through. I considered walking out and waiting for my boyfriend in the lobby, but I didn't want to hurt his feelings. I checked the time three times after that, praying it would be closer to the end than it seemed to be. I'm giving this a 4 for Wahlberg actually trying (most of the time) and the visuals, mostly at the end. If you just fast forward to the last hour or so, it might be worth your time. Other than that, don't bother unless you're a fan of the franchise as a whole.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
427,jtypatrick,Better Than Revenge of the Fallen,5,27 June 2014,"I will make this short. I liked this film, It is to long. The movie has two good ideas for plot lines which should have been spread out, The Lockdown/ creators should have been a second film. This film should have focused more on the humans hunting the Transformers. The dinobots story could have been an amazing story line, but was just a side note.I am a fan of Dark of the Moon I felt the writing was better i was also glad to be rid of Megan Fox. I feel in the series that that Age was a film that was trying to find new footing, It is difficult in my mind for a film series to continue and be rebooted while keeping the same director. I feel Bay should have been replaced an acted only as producer. The films get to be more of the same.Why was there not more connectivity from the past films with some of the military characters? Each film i feel has to be retconed because they didn't have a strong idea for over all storyline. The new Autobots are characters that are thrown at you.

428,ClarkCJ7570,Better save your money instead of spending on this joke!!!,4,28 June 2014,"Well, i myself consider a Transformers fan and i liked everything about them, specially the Autobot leader Optimus Prime, even if he is real or not, i have a great respect for him. I used to watch Transformers anime and then animation and then i found that there are live action movies as well. I started watching them one by one. I liked the whole part where *****(SPOILERS AHEAD) Autobot comes to earth to find the all-spark and the story sequence with humans and how much their character is important for the movie. Then an alien named Fallen comes to destroy our Sun. Optimus dies and gets revived by Sam using the matrix of leadership. Also that scene with Jetfire was so cool when he sacrifices himself to give his parts to Optimus. By the end of the movie i was overwhelmed. Then Optimus finds that Sentinel prime is long sleeping on the moon. He revives him again using the matrix. This shows how much he respected his teacher. After watching all three movies i knew that i got what i paid for and was happy. I thought the series was done for good, then again they announced Transformers 4 Age of Extinction. There was rumors that this time there will be no involvement of humans in this movie. I had no idea of the plot that time. Well, Before watching the fourth movie, i came across review section on IMDb and there was nothing surprising, bad comments like always. I thought they are crazy so i went ahead and watched it today. Now i am like WHAT THE F****K HAVE I DONE!!!! First of all Mark Wahlberg in this movie, are you kidding me??? He maybe better in other sci-fi movies no offense but this movie is not something a common actor can handle. If i ignore the casting the first thing comes in mind is the plot. Who must have gone crazy to write such sh**t and shi**ty dialogs? Whosoever he is he just destroyed the originality of the Transformers series. I wanted to sleep the entire time in the second half. My money went to trash, if i ignore money wastage then as a Transformers fan i hate this movie by all means. There weren't any 3D effects as well. Story didn't seemed any progressed from start to end. Its like they are trying to make the movie long as possible. Wastage of 3 hours as well. I don't really like to write reviews but its all this movies fault that i am writing this , i am forced to share my opinion. If i talk about casts again then i would say, in the entire time of the movie they seemed unnecessary specially the daughter and her boyfriend, anyway its not their fault, its all on the shitty plot. They are being told to do what they are not supposed to, what they are not meant to.I gave this thing 4/10, which i still think is too much. I would say one last thing, good plot is the driving engine of any movie, without it, movie won't be anything but an empty shell, which is exactly the Transformers 4 is.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
429,camayanknailwal,Attempt of Rejuvenation!,7,26 June 2014,"TRANSFORMERS: Age of Extinction (3/5)Michael Bay always succeeds in surprising me with a new Brand of special effects. And with the 4th installment he raises the bar even more than the previous Dark of the Moon. Also to his capability, he hooks you throughout the movie(Despite the excessive runtime) with just visuals itself. But, like always, the plot is weak......and this time it's hammy acting that irritates. Simply ZERO emotional quotient. I never cared for any character. The Robots were fascinating though. Especially Galvatron and Lockdown. Bumblebee was cut short but good and Optimus rocked!Other flaws include forgettable soundtrack, bad editing(30 minutes were absolute waste) and the excessive and somewhat repetitive action in the climax staged at Hong Kong. It never overpowered the thrilling Clash at Chicago of T3. The screenplay was inconsistent. At one moment, you are blown away with the spectacular cinematography & action, but just the other one bores you badly. This venture continued till the end.Still, at last I will recommend watching T4. The end promises for something great to come i.e very much awaited since the first installment. Very Watchable.

I've seen reviews concerned about the poor acting and so on, but to me, the script was the worst thing by far. In fact, I have decided to remember Ehren Kruger's name, so that I can avoid his work in the future.There were continuity errors throughout, every single character was underdeveloped (there were simply too many of them), the attempts at comedy were pretty pathetic, the dialogue was generally idiotic and the pacing was ridiculous. Previously established rules about how the transformers work (e.g. regarding their sparks) are ignored, which makes suspension of disbelief very difficult. It honestly felt like there was only one draft of the script which was scribbled down in a hurry.I realize that the first three films don't set the bar very high, but this one is simply much worse. All you really get when you watch it is two and a half hours of chaotic nonsense.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

432,nerdingsince1996,cool movie with too many boring moments,4,25 June 2014,"this movie has top class cinematography and visual effect. add epic scores, explosions, robot fights and a director who can mix it well to the equation and you get one cool movie. however, for me, when compared to its predecessors this one fall short.with 2.5 hour long, this movie feel dragged in some part. the plot follow a linear path but the pacing is-i don't know the right word for it- too fluctuated. it can change from one boring scene to epic scene so abruptly. it makes you excited one moment then bored minutes later. there's just less visually amazing robot fights and to many unnecessary dialogs, overdone, silly, failed humor, annoying clichés and character decisions. editing flaws, i guess. i said this movie fall short to its predecessors because of this lack of visually amazing robot action scenes and more humans combats. after seeing DOTM this one really lack exciting action moments.i don't know if not casting any of the cast of the previous movies is a great move because there's just too many new characters here, both humans and robot wise, and they didn't handle it very well. for me, i just too attached to the previous cast. i miss everyone. i didn't feel any connection to any of the new characters. there's just not enough background story and good performances. literary, the acting is so bad (i meant no offense) and the chemistry is nonexistence.there are plot holes here and there, but no major stuff, you can ignore it. no character development. a few cliché turns. they often mix dialogs with loud sound effects, soundtrack and action sequence making me hard to understand anything-especially since i am not native English speaker. however, there's this one scene that shocked me, they choose a surprising take on funny sidekick guy. not enough character development to affect me that much but still..... shocked.anyway, they have implanted the concept of Optimus Prime becoming bitter and losing faith in humanity... a good concept if only they dig deeper to this potential sub plot. but no, they just hovering on the subject one or two times then resolve it so abruptly.bottom line, like i said, it's a cool movie with to many boring moments. 3.5/5.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

It is an excellent movie,book your tickets,grab some popcorn and watch this amazing movie! No matter what the Critics think this movie is freaking AWESOME. All the actors are really good especially Mark Walberg. New Comer Nicola Peltz is OK and the Transformers are amazing!!!! There are a lot of great fight scenes. The movie has humor which feels a bit flat and its a long movie. But its awesome!!! Don't think its a Micheal Bay Movie,Just go and watch it like any other action movie. You will love it. All the fight scenes are wonderful and there are some really epic scenes in the movie. The cars are also stylish and beautiful. Story is a little bit confusing at times but it holds together in the end.All in All I love this movie and I will recommend this to anyone",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Dialogues seems a bit boring like everything u heard before in Micheal bay's previous filmsfinally the most negatives goes to the running time its over long and makes u boring half way and loose interest in the filmbut what keeping u watching is the visual effect thats it go for it if you like visual effects mindless action. there nothing new to talk about here i gave it 6/10 for visual presentation .",Transformers - Age of Extinction
435,HeroCritic,"There is some good, there is some bad",5,6 October 2014,"There are some good news and some bad news for this movie. The good news is that the effects and the battles in this movie are surpassing many other titles, in their uniqueness and complexity, fun to see. The bad news is there are some things in the movie that really get on your nerves. One of them is a weird incestuous-type ""affection"" of the father protagonist with his daughter in the movie, i don't see where the hell that fits in, in a transformers movie, or why the hell would someone include that in the scenario. Really annoying when even during intense action scenes the father says or does something according to that sickly affection he supposedly has. Is that supposed to be FUNNY or something? The 2nd annoying factor that permeates the movie is this idiotic obsession that somehow Optimus Prime is super-kind and likes humans, really likes them, so that he sacrifices himself over and over again and gets in danger and abandons his own kind over and over again, it gets tiring, almost sickening, so much ""kindness"" and ""altruism"" from a super big all powerful robot, enough already, we GET IT. I mean these two concepts in the movie can really be frustrating, otherwise it is watchable and some unique ideas in the graphics and effects i see for the first time, battles in cities, spaceships, etc.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
436,helwazan,Boring and too long,1,24 September 2014,"One of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life i was bored and i was waiting for the movie to end desperately. The movie is 2 hours 37 minutes long, Michael Bay ruins the franchise with another Transformers movie again!!, The story of the movie is repeated exactly like dark of the moon and from the previous parts as well, there was a scene after 2 hours and 15 minutes i think was exactly the same in dark of the moon and i mean exactly where that green Autobot which i don't know his name as it was not told in the movie!! flying one of those ships trying to escape, it felt exactly like dark of the moon, I felt nothing different except they added Dinobots and they didn't do it well either i felt like the movie is too long Michael Bay was trying to put to much details and then he decided to finish things up, the story starts with Autobots are being hunted by humans, and what next this transformer who hunts Optimus his name is not even told in the movie, i didn't catch it, and i wont watch the movie again even to care, another point which is Galvatron, it might be me, but I'm a fan of the original story, Galvatron was changed from Megatron by Unicron to enslave him not by humans work, after 2 hours of watching the movie i turned it off, i reached the point where i don't care whether the story ends or not, i already know that the Autobots will win as always and in the end there must be a scene where it says something about there will be Transformers 5, and guess what i was right!, Galvatron in the end says that he is reborn again blah blah blah and he will be back, I don't believe that there will be any good transformers movie at least 10, 20 years from now, unless the franchise is rebooted by someone else apart from paramount pictures and Michael Bay.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
437,AB-Crawford,Long winded but not as bad as the reviews.,7,18 October 2014,"First off, I grew up with the original cartoon series. If a critic didn't rush home like I did and religiously watch the original series, I can't take their review serious. I agree this movie would have been much better if they had found 10 to 15 minutes to cut out. The action over the last hour is great, but it's like that feeling you get when you know you ate too many sweets. I liked the Lockdown character. I thought the voice and appearance were great. Galvatron was a little underwhelming. I didn't like the idea of him being a rogue created by humans. Hopefully they build more depth in his character next movie. The dinobot thing worked well enough. In truth, the dinobots never had a great background story anyway and this flowed well enough to get them into the action. Optimus' beat down of Grimlock probably seemed out of place to many viewers, but in truth, it was as bit of a acknowledgment of the original series that probably went over their head.I think Mark Wahlberg is an upgrade. Stanley Tucci and Kelsey Grammar's characters are both a little thin, but they're always worth watching and really deliver despite the marginal quality writing. One thing that I felt really stood out is that the main character in this movie is finally Optimus Prime. He had obviously been a major character in the first three movies, but he is finally the star. Not just a big, blowing things up star, but the actual main character in the story. I'm hoping that carries through to the next.As with most things, it's not as bad as they say.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
438,israphel-53548,Transformers: Age of Extinction - Review,2,25 May 2016,"It's a Michael Bay movie, what did you expect? Transformers: Age of Extinction had me looking at my watch for most of the film. The only watchable scenes were the action sequences but even those were utter garbage. The characters are so 2-dimensional they might as well be paper cutouts. Hell, even paper cutouts would be more convincing. The plot is stupid and dragged out to make more screen time and the dialogue is cringe-worthy. This movie makes hardly any sense at all, it's just a jumble of CGI and explosions with big robots. It's probably one of the worst films I have seen. Do I recommend Transformers: Age of Extinction? No, no I do not. It may be 'fun', but it's pointless. The CGI is pretty good but that's about it. Watch at your own risk of brain cells getting killed.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
439,wolfybiscuts,"Good movie, with some flaws",9,25 June 2014,"OK, this movie will get panned by critics no matter what. Many of the modern generation of film goers simply do not understand that this movie is based on a toy / kids TV show. Most critics are hoping for deep meaningful story lines which this movie does not really have.If you have seen the other transformers movies, then you can expect similar, with outstanding special effects, explosions and big battles. The only gripe I have with this new trilogy as a transformers fan is that it makes the same mistake as the others and lacks character consistency in regards to the actual robots.Lockdown does a good job at being the main bad guy - so does galvatron in some respect, but thats it. The story focuses on the Autobots way too much and as always the handful of good guys will fight a nameless army of bad guys. Even the human villains did a better job.The dinobots being a big draw-card for many fans in this movie, are left speechless in the whole movie. Grimlock does not even talk! In the cartoon Grimlock has character and squares off against optimus prime. This was shown in the movie, but missed a golden opportunity to show the audience the rivalry they had in the transformers universe. All the dinobots looked fantastic, but had no character. If Grimlock and the other Dinos had more of an interaction with the other cast this could have been the best Transformers movie to date.Mark Walberg is pretty good as the over protective father and seems to be a better lead than Shia Lebouf ever was. The other cast do a fine job, but the movie ends too abruptly and there is no chance for the audience to take in just what the plot is by the ending. Although the movie is now open to go in a more interesting path following the transformers adventures in other places other than only on earth. The first half was good and then the movie turns into shaky cam shot after shaken cam shot once the story moves to China.In all I enjoyed the movie, but I cant help but think that it missed a chance to be so much better. Bring on the Quintessons, Hotrod and Unicron for the next one please. Oh and bring back star scream!Michael Bay, my advice for the next movie, is please focous on the decepticons more and stop using too much shaky cam. Focus on each robots unique abilities like in the cartoon and have each one involved in their own story lines within the bigger plot.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Actions is okay, so long as you don't expect any climax. There's no awe moment here. For the last 30min, I lost interest and wish the movie will over soon. Characters weren't boldly written...so I can hardly feel for any, even for optimus prime. I kinda miss the bond between autobots and people, which are not shown here. Too many missing links between the incident at third movie and AoE. However, still a flick to watch in your spare time especially if you're into robots and story doesn't matter much.

444,mmanderson96,Too Many Explosions,4,28 June 2014,"In comparison to the ""original"" three, the movie is only slightly better than the second one... and we all know how awful the first one was. The beginning of the movie was the best by far: the plot was developing, the characters were interacting, and one could actually relate to the film. However, about 45 minutes into the film it just plummeted. Michael Bay went completely overboard with the explosions, there were even explosions where it didn't make sense for there to be any. The explosions made it impossible to focus on what was happening, and to lose touch with the characters. The lines during the entire final two-thirds of the film are cheesy and cliché. Its a movie that I will happily never watch again.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
445,ramendas21,Only for heavy action lovers,7,27 June 2014,"In a nutshell, this is a movie completely for those who are crazy about actions sequences. I don't remember when did I watch last a Hollywood flick which was covered with around 80-85% of actions scenes, at least when the movie is close to 3 hours running time.Positive side of the movie is introduction of new characters (and famous), addition of Dinobots, some of the super-slow motion action sequences of Autobots. Also some humorous scenes between father and daughter.If you are planning for a late night show and a bit sleepy and you don't enjoy continuous heavy actions, you might end up with a headache.6.5 out of 10.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
446,thegolden_idea,Worth watching,7,21 September 2014,"This movie really expresses two different opinions based on my analytical thinking. The first one is that the movie is full of unstoppable action. Consequently, I give it an easy 8/10 for people who like action movies which contain a lot of crashes and explosions. Also, there are a lot of machines (autobots)that can be enjoyed because of the variety. On the other hand, the story is confused, the plot is disturbed with holes, and the acting is not that good. For example, the new invented autobots are remarkably undefeatable; they can be separated to pieces and then rebuild themselves. So, how come they destroyed at the end in few minutes without fighting? However, I liked Mark and Nicola acting but others were bad. In addition, some weak jokes in the middle they just take you out from the seriousness of the situation. For instance, one of the autobots smoking a bullet or missile.. COME ON. Overall, to people who like a strong completed core story, don't have much expectation or just see it for the sake of the Transformers series. I rate this one a 5/10 and by the way, it is the worst among the other Transformers movies. Final statement, I would like to say to anyone wanna watch this movie, ""don't be a deep thinker during watching this movie and it'll be a worthy one"".",Transformers - Age of Extinction
447,DaTruth510,If You Don't Like This You Just Don't Like Transformers!,9,28 June 2014,"Wow I cant believe how hard people are when it comes to this franchise, I mean what is it? Do they just not like robots that transform or do they really just hate Michael Bay that much that anything he touches they are ready to crap on it when they see the first trailer.So many people are saying the Turtles movie is going to be crap and that was last year before they even saw a trailer! Is that because Bay produced it? (key word produced not directed by).I'll admit i was disappointed in a couple of the previous movies but still liked them, but they could have been better. But this one completely blows them out of the water! People said there wasn't enough focus on the robots this one is all about the robots and their technology and history.This one is better in every way the jokes are funnier, its seems more believable (it is a movie about Transforming robots don't forget), the shots are amazing, and say what you want about Michael Bay's stories but when it comes to pure action scenes he is one of the best!So when i see these 1 star reviews it's obvious that these people wanted to hate this movie before they saw it because everything they were bitching about was basically fixed. People its a movie about transforming robots so what exactly are you wanting really. Oh yeah and the cast was a hell of a lot better.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
448,J_Force,Better than Expected,8,7 October 2014,"This movie is really not as bad as critics say it is. I didn't see anything wrong with the movie, except that the beginning may have started off boring but, as the film kept moving it was impressive from my point of view. I enjoyed the story line and the new characters. The action was great and it was a lot more entertaining than Dark of the Moon. I have to admit it was hard to understand in some ways but the films amazing concept made up for it. It wasn't as good as the first transformers but a lot more improved than the last two movies. I was really impressed with the special effects in this film, the robot dinosaurs were definitely the most exciting part of the movie, it had me on the edge of my seat.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Fun, fast, and leaving you exhilarated.The 3D was pretty good too on this movie. Good 3D, highest level of Action I've probably ever seen in while, long in duration, is well worth the popcorn action movie you pay for. Much, much better than other movies that leave you disappointed when spending your money.This movie was a throwback in scale to the 90s, and I loved it and if you are a full blooded guy who keeping the inner kid alive.

450,summerehca,Average,6,25 June 2014,"Just saw Transformers: AOE today and not quite sure how to make something out of it. I felt disconnected with most human characters, actually I only give credit to Stanley Tucci and 90% of Mark Wahlberg's appearances. Bumblebee is still awesome as ever. Even Optimus felt 'tired'. There were sequences where editing should have been better. I didn't like how Galvatron and the re-made robots transform, it lacked that very famous 'transforming' sound we all Transformers fans loved and have been looking forward to on such scenes. Hound was funny. I was actually on the verge frustration when finally the Dinobots were released. Loved Grimlock! I just wished they could've made him talk at least a couple of times. I remembered the Dinobot who delivered a line, Strafe or Slug. I'm not jumping up for this one, though I was expecting more. My best Transformers movie yet is still the 2nd installment. Nevertheless, the fighting sequences are spectacular, especially in 3D. Watch it, I may be indifferent with my reviews. Judge it for yourself.NB: The scriptwriters appear to like to destroy places that start with 'CH'. Chicago, then China (Hongkong, but still just wanted to make a connection, lol)",Transformers - Age of Extinction
451,george59883-36-312142,I Don't Like It,2,1 July 2014,"I don't no whether to hate this or just laugh at it. I mean it is a Michael Bay Transformers film so you would expect one of those two reactions, but I find myself just laughing at the sheer stupidity of the film. I sit here to you now and have to tell you to not see this film at all.This film, again, makes the mistake of giving the Transformers little character development as well as no screen time. It is just so sad when you see the these big spectacles on screen and you don't even know what is going on. Optimus is the only one who seems to get a scratch of character and in this film you just don't understand what he or the other Autobots ever do. Bumblebee is turned into even more of a moron and just seems to be reduced to another lackey that could get killed at any moment. There is a blue samurai one that is so stereotypical that you are just so disappointed and a waste of Ken Watanabe. John Goodman also voices a fat one and all of his jokes are swearing and are just trying to go for an older audience and again given no character development. There is also the green one that seems to be the cool and somehow gets a jacket affect to make him even cooler. And the Dinobots. I was hoping to see the Dinobots, but I just got mechanical Dinosaurs and when they show up on screen you get some cool shots, but it is too late to keep your attention longer than a minute because they show up for only the last 20 to 30 minutes tops. And the effects aren't even that great. I felt that some of the transformers transformations were just horribly done and the shiny effect given to some of the newer autobots just make it look sloppy. I liked the gun face guy because he had the most character out of all the robots, but has some patchy motivations of why he is doing what he is doing.The humans are also annoying. Nicola Peltz is just there for eye candy and her boyfriend is just there for like two scenes and then becomes just as useless as Shia Lebouf. Mark Wahlberg is a better character than the Shia Lebouf because he actually does things. He is rough and tough and is an Texan inventor standing for our American ideals. Kelsey Grammar is the villain who is trying to get rid of the transformers to save earth and some other things as well. Stanley Tucci is hilarious to me at least because he seems to have the most fun with his role. That let Tucci chew the scenery and I think that he gets the best lines out of all of them. It just seems like that Michael Bay doesn't know how to progress the story coherently.It really does try to give us some emotional moments especially trying to develop a father daughter relationship between Mark Wahlberg and Nicola Peltz, but it doesn't let those scenes breathe enough because it seems to be immediately followed by a funny joke. Some characters are there basically to make jokes and if someone dies, you don't care because their sadness is represented by a shrug and then they move onto the next punchline. He doesn't let the movie breathe for itself as well as just throwing fifty jokes at us hoping that only a couple hit. It just feels lazy.I also felt that the amount of product placement and catering is horribly over done. Some scenes literally cater to Chinese market and there is some stupid pieces of product placement. We see several times where characters just stop to take a drink of some popular drink for no reason at all. They just do it for product placement. Or they have robots that also have brands like the X-Box robot from the first film.The film is also so long. This movie just keeps going and going and going and it just doesn't seem to stop until it just ends. I mean they prolong they thing for the last half hour and then they just end the film. And the score was also not that good. They had this one song that they kept putting into the film to try and evoke some kind of response that just didn't work. And at the end the again play a song with the Optimus monologue and it just seems so clique. And I hate it for not even being a Linkin Park song.This is film making at its laziest denominator that has some of the worst writing and directing. Some of the jokes are better, but that isn't saying anything about a Transformers film and the effects seem to be spotchy at points. Characters are just there to set up action pieces and the plot makes no sense at all and some scenes don't even need to be there making it way to long for its own good. It is better to laugh at this film because that is all that it is good for. I am giving this film 1 out of 4 stars.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
452,ralph_valkenburgh,Transformers - Age of extinction - an extinction it sure is.,3,15 November 2014,"Let me precede this by saying, I was never charmed by the whole Transformers hype, not even when I was a kid, and all the other kids were playing with their transformer toys. I loved the CGI in the preceding movies, and obviously this one too. Does that make up for it? NO WAY!I thought the first movie to be alright. The second one I was getting enough of the kid they used. The third one I was like, okay stop, near the middle of the movie. Now to age of extinction. What a fart it was (a 2.5 hour long one), and one let ripped by someone suffering gastroenteritis. I can write a book about it's awkwardness, and how unfunny it truly was. The only funny moment was when they killed off Lucas, who is new to the franchise, never had any character development, and his best friend did not mention him once after that happened. In fact he didn't even cry at the moment when it happened, but he did cry when Optimus Prime left the planet. ALIVE AND WELL.

454,gunnar_zero-1,Much better than I thought,7,22 September 2014,"I must admit that I was wrong about this one. I hated Revenge of the Fallen and Dark of the Moon, both were stupid movies with what I personally think is the worst comic relief I've ever seen on a movie. Age of Extinction however, lacked the horrible toilet humor from the previous ones, the humor was way more family oriented and was actually enjoyable. And the human characters were not annoying, yes, some of the acting was bad in general, but Mark Wahlberg, Stanley Tucci and Kelsey Grammar were all great, obviously not Academy Awards worthy, but they all gave solid performances with what they were provided with.As always the visuals are amazing, and I personally think that the editing was also better, the action was easier to follow and the scenes in general seemed more stream lined.Overall it is a better movie than the 2 previous installments, not better than the first one in my opinion, but perhaps just as good. I personally think that the change in the cast was needed and in my case, I greatly appreciated it.I give it a 7/10 because it is still lacking in several departments, but it is way better than the last two previous installments, an improvement I honestly thought would not happen.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
455,mohitshh,Worst Transformer movie ever,6,17 September 2014,"I believe ""Transformers: Age of Extinction"" is the worst Transformer movie ever. I am a fan of transformers and have watched all the previous ones. The giant killing robots, the cool cars that they transform into and the super heavy weight fight scenes are the things that I like about these movies. You can just sit back and enjoy the sci-fi tech powered action scenes and not worry too much about the story line.Hey, wait a minute. Did I actually write that the story is not relevant. No, not at all. I mean to say that the usp of these movies is the action and the way the characters are build up in the minds of the viewer. The more the audience is able to relate to the characters, the greater is their engrossment in the film and the better they enjoy those fight scenes. The key is to give the audience something to root for. Otherwise its just some big robots ripping each other apart and people start to think what's the point of it all. Thus a logical, coherent story line is sine qua non.Well I think that the makers of this movie took the not worrying about the story thing way to seriously in this movie. To be honest I was very excited after watching the trailer and reading the plot. This movie promised, apart form the usual transformers awesomeness, giant robo bounty hunters and to top it all off, robot dinosaurs. I mean who would not love to see giant robot dinosaurs kicking some ass.That would have been totally awesome but, given the the poor acting, haphazard story line, not so logical scenes and the lame jokes and comments being made all at the wrong time, it was not so. The action sequences were wonderful but they failed to have a commensurate effect because of the untimely and not so witty comments. The dinosaurs were great but were given way too less screen time. They could have been to used to unleash some more destruction.The whole movie just did not seem to be able to build up the anticipation regarding the ultimate showdown between the main warriors. There was little effort put in character buildup. The scenes in the movie which were meant to display the growing emotional connections between the characters, looked like they were specially drafted for children.The only character which I thought did justice to its role in the movie was that of Optimus Prime. I hate to say it but I was very very disappointed after watching the movie.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

I think everything has been done to make this movie a total disaster! What's up with two blonds with absolutely no storyline for either? Do we go back to the Hollywood period of putting some pretty faces with dumb dialog? Because in almost 3 hours of this movie neither one had a single substantial thing in their lines. Well, I can actually say the same of all the dialogs in this movie. The plot of the movie is incredibly weak and has no substance to it. And characters are blah. It feels like several people just threw in pieces of their ideas without combining it into a single flow. I barely made it through the entire movie. What a waste of time and production money.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
457,TitusPrime,"Transformers ""Age of Extinction"" a painfully ironic title.",4,1 August 2014,"I am a Transformer fan. I grew up with them, played the games, read some of the books and all that blah blah geek credential noise.I enjoyed the first three films as well, it wasn't easy to ignore the crippling handicaps represented by Shia Labeouf's atrocious acting.I have still found some deeply genuine moments of redemption in each of the previous films.Nothing could have prepared me for the waves of depression or intellectual bludgeoning this installation would inflict on me though.On the most shallow surface level and with some of the finest CGI in the world, it failed one of it's most basic functions, Big Robots wars. The battles lack inspiration; they are as exciting as ordering a fast food burger from the value menu. Boring you to the point where you look forward to the failed chuckle fest provided by characters. Many would argue that those are classic elements of the Transformers, which they are. Maybe it is the story, which has been abused so badly it passes that damage back to the viewer, maybe that is what makes this film a horrible mistake? For me, it was the dialogue that murdered my hope for this film. The story couldn't escape the pandering tone of the script. The vacuity one is subjected to is an insult to the viewer. Black Holes begin appearing in the plot and start to erase any hope that it will somehow get better, maybe it will turn itself around if you just keep watching. From the start the film seeks out and tranquilizes any genuine emotional connection with it's characters; they become glossy eyed and seem to only be able to communicate in platitudes covered in artificial sweetener . Amidst a background of brutal devastation, unjust persecution, terror of being hunted, all trust replaced with paranoia and facing the extinction of our entire species, one would expect to empathize with the characters, or at least the situation. But it is not there; there is as much genuine feeling towards this impending doom as one would expect when a goldfish is about to be flushed away.So, what of our hero, Optimus Prime?! His magnanimous strength and ethical fortitude can always be counted on to save the day; yet it appears to be gone. His depth has been buffed down and polished up until it matches the rest of the generic character templates that have been plugged in to this formula.Sitting through the first two hours was an endurance test. Since the story and plot became swiftly shattered hopes, all you are left with is trite banter and the failed comedic interactions of the supporting Autobot characters. Watching them is like being force fed spoonfuls of saccharine against your will. Each stale delivery of dialogue comes from a handful of nails; painfully hammered in with almost every scene they inhabit.There is no belief that can remain in suspension under this film's lack of self respect, or the disrespect towards the intelligence of the viewers shown by the production. As I watched, I couldn't help but become angry that this was how little they must think of me, of us, the fans. ""Age of Extinction"" reveals itself to be nothing more than a collection of the most marketable aspects of the previous films. A meal cooked from the same recipe, of explosions, giant alien robots, overused camera direction and a mindless ballet of slow motion combat. But this time they sweetened the recipe up for us by drowning it in corn syrup.It is an offensive waste of what little time we all have in this world. Time that could be spent on far greater activities, like organizing your underwear, or watching a better film.If even one person reads this and decides to take my advice, than it was time well spent IMHO. If you read this and decide that I am being melodramatic in my review of its vacuous insult to you and itself; by all means watch it. Forget everything I have said; in the end all we have is our own opinion.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

The dialog seemed something from from a cartoon. The visual effects were impressive however, but let down in places. The entire storyline was dragged out, like the plot for the story was too quickly written, there was no depth to the characters, nor was there any meaning behind why a certain character was ""ressurected"" and no one knew who he was? The film is set 5 years after Megatron has left been destroyed, now the CIA & FBI know who he is and what he's capable of, so why reincarnate him? The film is an overall disappointment making you wonder as, when and how the franchise will end. Definaltley a Sunday afternoon movie as a last resort.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

The stupid emotional love scenes that Bay obsesses with. Seriously who cares about a little love/hate triangle between the dad , daughter and stupid boyfriend ? The scenes involving those three were cringe worthy.The daughter screaming for Daddy's help at every second scene. The plot doesn't follow the movie and jumps all over the place. I think the plots for Transformers movies are the worst I have ever seen. This is no exception and on a par with the second movie , which was just as bad.

Set about 5 years after the Chicago fiasco - the one that happened in Dark of the Moon, this one is even more boring and longer than that. I don't understand the point of stretching a decent 1 to 2 film franchise to a 4 or 5 film one and sucking all the fun from the first film. I'm sure they're raking in the moolah and some people can't wait to see a first-day screening but is it worth it with so much dislike for the franchise, that comes after watching it. Its like the Twilight saga all over again.So this one starts off with a boom, rather bizarre, showing that the reason earth's dinosaurs became extinct was not because of an asteroid as we all know but because of transformers! What comes next is a 160-min long ordeal into how the humans are now beginning to hunt down every alien transformer with the help of a ''bounty-hunter transformer''. And then there's this father - daughter family in Texas whose lives get pushed on the edge after an unlikely discovery of Optimus Prime. So they, along with the daughter's boyfriend, end up being chased by the government, the CIA, a Black Ops group and of course the evil transformer. And then there's this future-tech-savvy tycoon/inventor/billionaire, played by Tucci, whose company KSI has used the ruins of the fallen Decepticons, including Megatron, from the Chicago battle into building their own transformers which they can control and operate which we all can predict is something that shouldn't be messed with. We all know who the father and daughter are.. Should i mention it again? Oh and I forgot about the wise words of wisdom Wahlberg has for his daughter regarding High school and boys and also his constant standoff with her boyfriend! So that was the premise and if you think you can sit through the climax of the story, which is basically the second half of the film - long and tiring and never-ending, you should definitely go watch it. Otherwise you should close this page and think of better ways of spending your weekend!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
461,bitwave,maybe good for bluray,4,25 June 2014,I have watched the first 3 TF movies and I loved them. I grew up with the cartoon show. TF4 is something else. its a movie without a script and its 3 hours. its a true insult to the intelligence of the viewers. I have no idea what they though when going forward with it. the transformers them selves are not robots anymore. they have the look of alien vs predator. all that was left that had any connection to the OG series is now gone. if the path they are looking for is a path for the demise of this franchise than they are definitely on it.,Transformers - Age of Extinction

If you go to see Transformers expecting to see a gripping heart warming character basis then you probably shouldn't go see it. Now if you go because you like me want to see transforming robots and tons of explosions and battle scenes then by all means go see it. You will get your moneys worth. I preferred whalberg over lebouf at least as the main star. To those complaining about only 5 autobots in the film the movie explains plain as day they were all hunted down and destroyed, hell that was the main plot twist. I liked the way they did the dino bots. Also to those reviewing on humor, who goes to a Transformers movie expecting to see a comedy? And what's with the novella of reviews? Was it good or bad, keep it to that not an essay of crap. For those complaining about the movies length look at the length of their reviews.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

When going to the pictures to see this film, I was at first sceptical, especially with the declining good plot lines that unfolded within each previous transformer film, but I let loose and decided to give this film a try. But little did I know that I was about to sit through 2 hours 45 minutes of boring, unnecessary and lets face it terrible scenes, that substituted good acting and a good storyline, for unrealistic explosions and boring fight scenes. Throughout the entire film, I waited for some decent character development (which should be expected in every film, regardless of what genre it belongs in) only to find us, the audience, dragged into a confusing world that takes place 5 years after the events of the third film, in which everybody hates the Autobots (the good guys) and from there on out forced through a boring- less than watchable storyline. In my opinion this film is extremely bad and just proves that the transformers franchise has had it's day. I do not recommend!",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Not to mention Peter Cullen's wonderful voice as Optimus Prime.That is, sadly, the only good thing about this movie. The plot makes no sense. A third of the cast is pointless and contributes nothing to the plot whatsoever. In spite of its length, there is no character development whatsoever. Instead, there is tedium.

This fourth one seems to disregard a lot of back story from the previous movies which was confusing. In the first movie we had the 'All Spark' which was supposed to be where it all started, but now we have 'The Creators' and don't get me started on this whole 'Energon' thing - not a mention of or indeed need for it in this movie despite it being the entire plot of the second movie.Now the story itself was not a bad one really although it really did go on and on and on without really progressing much.

The action sequences,this time around,were great.Now,I know who is fighting who due to the superb special effects in the film.The explosions felt realistic,the fight scenes did too.The Transformers,or the Autobots,were well-developed to the point you actually care about them.Some that you didn't care about were just new characters. The Dinobots,the new characters in Transformers Age of Extinction,were awesome and mind-blowing.They were exactly what I wanted them to be since when the first trailer first appeared. The acting was descent.Mark Wahlberg was amazing at his role,but that was to be expected.Nicola Peltz was alright in her role,but she improved from the horrible 'The Last Airbender'.Overall,acting,yes,was in fact descent when it came to all the cast. The entire movie itself was great and a huge improvement from the franchise.It is by far the best Transformers film to date.Who knows the fifth installment may be better.This also may be the best Michael Bay movie also.Now while a lot of people may hate the movie,I loved it.Overall score 10/10 tmovie soon",Transformers - Age of Extinction

It had occasional funny one-liners and the special effects were good but everything else sucked. No plot, no vision, no character development and the parts that should have been realistic, weren't.

Came out of the cinema all smiles and wanting more.Just so you judge if we are on the same level: I was a big fan of G1. I liked the first movie, although it was a bit childish in comparison to the sequels. Rise of the Fallen didn't do much for me, but Dark of the Moon was really good. And now, Age of Extinction is just great.Admittedly, the storyline is quite basic. Dark of the Moon had a much more interesting story.Funnily enough though, Dark of the Moon, while awesome, felt a bit tedious to watch at times (call it 'too long' or 'too much').Age of Extinction did not feel tedious or 'too long' AT ALL. It was flowing, it left me wanting more.Tons of battles, great sceneries, great effects as usual. The dinobots were a great addition.And no Shia Labeouf! Hurray we're free :) And as far as I hear, he didn't really enjoy performing in the series anyway, so it's a win-win for everybody. Mark Wahlberg was good.Definitely watch in IMAX for the full experience, it's worth your dollar.I'm not a fan of 3D in general (I'd prefer IMAX 2D if it was offered), but still the 3D was well made.I definitely want to go watch it a couple of more times in cinema.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

474,aflo465,Pretty Bad...,3,6 July 2014,"This is by far the worst of the 4 total Transformers movies. As far as pros and cons go, there are very little pros and many cons. The first good thing about the movie is the actors. Other than his cheesy lines, Mark Wahlberg does a great job as the father/hero roll. Stanley Tucci does good as well adding some comic relief to the movie. The action and cinematics are fantastic as expected, but there are things like music at the wrong moments and unrealistic instances that will pull you away from it. The story was well written but poorly executed. Instead of enhancing or adding to the story to make it even better, they chose to stretch it out with more useless drama and action scenes to make it 3 hours. This makes it even more confusing and there are a lot of unnecessary things in the story that doesn't seem to make sense. By the end of the movie you're left with questions like: ""What was the point of that?"", ""How is that possible?"", ""Why didn't they just do this?"", and ""Was he a good guy or a bad guy?"". There are also quite a bit of aspects to this movie that will quickly pull you away from it. The story of the movie can be explained in less than a minute and is somewhat predictable so I wouldn't recommend watching the movie if your not wanting another lengthy action drama. Another aspect that makes this so bad is how incredibly cheesy and unrealistic it is. A transformer can slash a building in half with one swing of it's hand but cannot smash Marky Mark defending himself with single gun... Overall I would not recommend this movie at all. It is much too childish for adults but at the same time has way too much death and destruction for young children.

I know a movie based on a toy shouldn't make much sense, but the beginning just too far fetched, it left me completely disgusted. Then I said to myself, don't worry about the annoying plot, let's just enjoy the action and what those CGI artists did with their long labouring hours. I didn't get much satisfaction. Transformers are supposed transform, this one I didn't see much of them. I still have some great memories from previous three, and you know what I am talking about, mid-air slow motion, Starscream, Prime with rockets strapped on, and more, so cool and so exciting! This time, none of those, money shots. Prime riding Dino, how lame. Best shot? At the beginning when the annoying friend got cooked! And I am serious. Now get to the real point, the whole movie is a giant ball a mess. Funny moment not funny. Action sequence too chaotic to stay interested. Too many villains, and I am not worry about any of them.

Bay has fixed one of the main problems with the first 3 films. We couldn't tell the transformers apart in the fight scenes, This has been addressed now. For a 160 min film it doesn't drag but yet you don't half to have ADHD to enjoy the film like the 3rd. Mark Wahlberg is his usual entertaining self with some great one liners and Nicola Peltz is there for pure eye candy, much like Megan Fox and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was. The special effects are great and can see the difference between this and the previous films. Overall a good action flick better than the 2nd and 3rd films but the original is still the best.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
484,danumber40,Pleasantly surprised but needs to slow down on cursing,7,2 August 2014,"After reading many of the reviews before seeing the movie, I was feeling the sense of an unspectacular movie, and in some ways, it was.Let's start with the bad.It was a very long movie. There were long, drawn-out scenes between the actors than there were with the Transformers. However, they played major roles and the conversations and action kept me interested.Speaking of the characters, there wasn't much development, which is to be expected in an action movie. But I grew on Cade (Mark Wahlberg) and Joshua (Stanley Tucci). Cade's daughter, Tessa (Nicola Peltz) cared for her father very much but came off as a constant whiner, always screaming for help. I don't mind girls with long legs, but they could at least not make them the weakest points.As for the Transformers, only two were from the past movies (Optimus Prime and Bumblebee), although other Autobots, like Ratchet, were mentioned. Another Decepticon named Lockdown, from the animated series, I believe, was introduced. New characters included Hound, voiced by an annoying cusser John Goodman, and Drift and Crosshairs. Another thing about these characters: You never saw Hound and Drift transform. You only saw the vehicles they became. That annoyed me. Drift transformed visibly once, into a helicopter, but that was it. I wanted to know how he transformed into his sleek car.Now, finally, let's point out the most hated thing, for me at least, about this movie: I was tired of all the cursing. Hound used the B-word several times, unnecessarily. And saying ""kicking ass"" over and over again isn't funny. It's simply annoying. The F-bomb was dropped twice, although one was humorously bleeped out. The other was clear and loud. Finally, the S-word was incessant. In fact, it was the first word used in the movie. Half the time, it seemed like an afterthought. ""Hey, let's just make them curse here."" Lot's of kids have the Transformers toys and want to see the movies, especially if they loved the series on TV. So to come to the theater and listen to all this cursing doesn't seem right.Speaking of afterthoughts, the characters had a few instances where they pointed out the obvious. They drive into a cornfield to escape the CIA after their house was blown up. So Shane drives into the cornfield. Then he says, ""I'm gonna try to lose them in this cornfield."" Duh. The cursing was the part I didn't like. The rest of the bad before it that I listed is what I can tolerate.Now for the good.The humor was full of advanced Disney Channel jokes. But like any Disney Channel show, they eventually get a joke that's really funny. The movie had a few funny instances in it.The action was bigger than the last movie, which was to be expected. But I thought I saw it all in the commercials. No, there were plenty more cargo ships literally being thrown around. I mean, when the big ship that stole Despicable Me 2's idea with the giant magnet was going after the special ""seed,"" it actually felt realistic. It picked up anything metal and dropped it onto the characters, including the giant robot dinosaurs.People complained about the confusing plot. I loved it. The way everything fell together and then broke and reattached kept me interested, along with the violent battles.I thought it was a good idea to ""modernize"" the badbots. Instead of cool transformations, the company KSI created their own robots that kind of dissolved into the air and then reconnected to form the robot or vehicle. It was sort of like a way to introduce a new era to the Transformers, to create new plots. And that worked--Megatron-turned-Galvatron got away. Like he always seems to do.I'm so happy the creators of the movie went away from cities like Chicago, New York, or San Francisco. Overused places. They went to Hong Kong instead.The violent battles were prolonged, like in the movie Man of Steel, but it wasn't boring. There was variety, cool sounds, many characters, occasionally some dialogue, and lots of things that go boom. And some dinosaurs. You can't go wrong with robotic dinosaurs.All in all, it's a movie that simply doesn't need unnecessary cursing. And it probably could've been shortened a little bit. But I think it's the best in the series.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

This whole series just got better with a whole new upgrade. I would say the part 3rd was actually boring but this one is certainly better and grander in all aspects!Chevy is bow not the only one in Autobox Team, a super hot Buggati and a cool green to compete against the baddies Koegneisess and A Lambo. The movie is an absolute entertainer.Storyline:Take 1: Humans And Alien Alliance! Humans no more need the services of Autobot and Optimus Prime to fight Galvatron and Decepticons. The movie unfolds as a company invents a metal which can be programmed into anything. The technology is harnessed from Megatrons and Megatron finally takes control to claim the SEED for Human Extinction on Mass level. A shady group sent by The Creator of Optimus Prime enters. While searching for Optimus, he hunts Autobots down with the Help of Humans. Take 2: Father- Daughter- Boyfriend Relation A Lot like Armageddon- Mark Wahlberg acts the protective father and Nicola Peltz acts the brave daughter! Jack plays the racer teenager's boyfriend. The chemistry is funny.Take 3: The New Autobots are brighter and better in Action. The biggest crowd cheer comes on the appearance of Bumble Bee. The new team of Super cars, a Japanese Samurai type- Buggati Veron, and a New Styleish Corvette is worth Watching.Take 4: The Stylish Villains Decepticons became whole lot stylish too. Lambo Aventador and Pagani Huayra The movie unfolds beautifully and everything you can ask for in an action flick directed by Michael Bay- Its there. Big Destruction, Cool Autobot-Decepticon Fights and and crazy stunts.The Movie is worth Watching! I am sure you can watch this one twice too- considering this a good 2 Hours 45 Minutes Movie.WHAT WAS DISAPPOINTING: The Dilogs could have been a Little Better. Too much Humanised version of Transformers have become a little predictable. X FACTOR: - AUTOBOT Crosshairs Attutude and Stunts - Optimus Prime Riding Dino(saur)bots - Bumble Bee in rescue actions - Background Music is Extraordinary Kids will love it! The College Goers will dig it, and the ones who have seen all the Transformers are now little tired of seeing a Car transforming into a Autobot- There's Prime riding a Dinobots for you guys!

486,miguel-p-fernandes,Very weak movie. Like all Transformers movies,3,30 June 2014,"It hurts me seeing this movie gain so much money. Other movies (like Captain America 2, for me the best movie of the year) deserve much more attention than this.I don't even know where to start. This movie is 2 and a half hours long! It just keeps going and going and, after 1 hour and 45 minutes, it gets painful to watch. By the end, I just want to get out of there. The plot is so weak, like the other movies (especially the second one), and it's just extremely flimsy. Another point that's just bad is the special effects. The scenes where there are fights and transformers transforming are worse than in the other movies, which is not understandable (how can a movie in 2007 have better special effects than a movie in 2014?). A thing that I noticed is the fact that slow motion was used in most of the fighting there was happening. Although I applaud the idea, because in the other movies the viewer could not understand what was going on during the fights, constantly using it is bad for the pace of the movie and just makes all the fights uninteresting.Michael Bay should have learned from the mistakes of his other movies (which were many), but no. The movie had humor (or attempt of humor, since no one laughed a bit in my movie theater. And the room was full) during all of the movie, even during the action scenes. All the fighting would stop so that the characters would have a comic moment, which actually took all the fun out off the action. And that just made me angry because I went there to see transformers fighting, and not bad comedy.The acting was bad from all of the cast, except from Mark Wahlberg, that was a nice surprise for me. Michael Bay was even able to make Stanley Tucci act bad. Not because of the actor itself, but because of his stupid character.Oh, and if you're one of those people that says the movie will be good just because of the dinosaur transformers, I hate to inform you that they're in the screen for only 10 minutes, in a movie of 2 and a half hours.This movie was the worst of the Transformers franchise. If you liked the previous movies, you'll dislike this one. If you loved the previous movies, you'll like this one.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
487,psymax,Transformers : The Age of Dinobots and Strong Female Characters,7,23 July 2014,"You will definitely know that the season of the Big Summer Box Office Blockbuster Movies has arrived with the premiere of the latest installment of the Transformers movie franchise, Transformers: Age of Extinction. This time the story takes place 5 years after the last Transformer film. So there's no Shia Lebouf or Josh Duhamel. Mark Wahlberg takes the male human lead and portrays a down on his luck inventor who is also a single father to his teenage daughter, who has a secret boyfriend which is sure to create some tension when the Dad finds out. Anyways, movie is almost 3 hours long so be prepared with a bottled water and some sustenance and a visit to the toilet beforehand if you want to seat yourself throughout the whole movie. The Dinobots makes an appearance this time around to the delight of fans of the classic U.S Transformers cartoon and with the addition of 3 strong female characters, that might suggest a more equal presentation for both sexes, may appeal to a wider audience then the male demographic. Like its predecessors, it's special effect galore with cool cars and trucks and even cooler action sequences. But the action this time is more 'tight' compared to the first few films which was a bit hard to focus on, since the action was like all over place. This film is definitely for those who enjoy watching giant alien robots kicking each other's butt in 3D.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
488,Frenchieep,Amazing ignore the bad reviews,9,28 July 2014,"Love this film, amazing action scenes and great story, I don't see what the other reviewers watched but it wasn't this film. It was full of action from the beginning, the variety of transformers in this as well just all fit so much better than just seeing the same ones over and over. As for the length of time not once did I get bored or wish it was over, I actually can't wait till the next one. I look forward the transformers movies as a lot of people do... And they haven't let me down even though I was worried about no Shia le bouf but mark wahlberg knocks it out of the park and his daughter played by Nicola peltz is definitely someone I could watch act for 2 or more hours, not just because of her beauty but because of her acting of every emotion possible in this film.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
489,i-markovic99,Is this a Bud Light commercial?,3,5 August 2015,"Sometime after the movie finished my friends found me outside and asked me why I walked out half-way thought the movie. Their disbelief that I spent about 45min alone in the parking lot was meet by my disbelief that they actually stayed for the whole movie. There was a chance that I would have been sexually assaulted in that lot, but I took that risk, because sitting through this movie was like being hit in the head with a shovel, every 45 seconds. Were ANY writers even hired to write this film? Let me sum up the entire script for you:Robot: you humans are arrogant and don't deserve any help to fight evil robots. Humans: We are really in a jam! can you please help us? Robot: Okay, but this is the last time I swear! (Giant robots exchange words, and have a glorious CGI fight, in between carefully placed Bud Light products and ads). There I just described this movie in details- I know, hard to believe- but there is actually nothing more to this script; there is no deep lessons of humanity, morality, friendship or overcoming adversity. It just a huge pile of S&*t that was meant to pay off mortgages of these entertainment juggernauts.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
490,dorazioandrew,Disappointing,5,27 June 2017,"By far the most disappointing movie of the 5 transformers films. Nowhere near as exciting as the other 4, too damn long approaches 3 hours long with 2/3 of he movie focusing on human nonsense. When the transformers are on screen though, it's action packed, exciting and explosive. Unfortunately it's rare that you see a transformer in action in this movie making a lot of appearances it not fighting for a while up until the end where the action definitely picks up. But my least favorite of the franchise.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
491,connorasivill,One word: BORING!,2,24 October 2018,"After being forced to watch this poor excuse for a movie in class, I was left shocked and horrified! Not because of the action or anything, because of how amazingly boring this film is. Scenes drag out for way too long, the action is way too excessive, the characters are absolutely bland and forgettable, the film itself is a massive snore from beginning to end. You may as well go to bed than watch this crap. Seriously!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
492,brethart_the1,Transformers- Age of Extinction: My perfect Summer Blockbuster this year.,9,25 June 2014,"How many times has it happened you go for a movie with some expectations and come out overwhelmed with the end result. Transformers: Age of Extinction did the same to me. Being a hard-core Transformers Fan since childhood i always had great expectations from the movies. Yes Transformers-1 being the best of lot, Transformers-2 kinda sucked except for actions, Transformers-3 lil better than the previous.Another sequel to the successful Transformers franchise where the story continues 4 years after the Chicago Event (Transformers-3). The Government are on a hunt for every robot(Good or Bad) and dismiss off the earth. CIA has made a deal with the Bounty Hunter (Lockdown)to rip apart every transformer and find ""Optimus Prime"" as the creator has some unfinished business with the Prime.Also KSI have created their own Transformers with the remaining of the dead transformers and now they have built a better and unique fighting machines.So all the Autobots are hiding and waiting for the return of their supremo PRIME. Prime has taken a form of Old damaged truck which Cade Yeager(Mark Wahlberg) happen to find. Cade is a mechanic and he lives on fixing things for people. For his surprise he finds OPTIMUS PRIME and he puts his family online to save OPTIMUS.Noticing the need of time PRIME and the rest of AUTOBOTS assemble to fix the urgency of bounty. Whether Autobots are successful in their mission or not is the rest of the plot.Micheal Bay has again delivered what he known for ""A COMPLETE BAYHEM"". Being a fan of Bay movies this one is purely among my Top 10 movies. As Transformers series are known for sloppy story-line (Except 1st part), this one actually have its heart at the right place. As an audience you can connect with the mechanic and the AUTOBOTS to a better level. ILM has proved again why they are the best in VFX, VFX for this is ground breaking as they have really put to another level for this one.Action sequences are top notch. Do checkout for OPTIMUS PRIME's and BUMBLEBEE's transformation to their new form (Gave me freaking goosebumps). DINOBOTS are great but didn't satisfy completely, HOUND and SLUG were great. LOCKDOWN as the evil master was really great and stood firm against the PRIME. Wahlberg was great to what he could deliver, Stanley Tucci is a funny guy and has his own sense here,Nicola and Jack Reynor were purely average.The length of the movie might kill lilbit as its 2.46 hours long runtime,still whatever i loved this one.Transformers: Age of Extinction is surely gonna be in my Blu-ray collection.Watch this one for sure !!!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
493,DarkBulletMurdock,Dinobots,5,30 August 2021,I wanted more dinobots. All of the trailers for the movie constantly showed the dinobots and you only got maybe 20 mins of dinobots. Very disappointing.,Transformers - Age of Extinction
494,OLee84-1,Not the best Transformers MOVIE!,8,22 September 2014,"First of all I liked the movie, mostly because of the F/X and partially the story! But there were some points I did NOT like. OK, so lets start with- are Autobots the bad guys (rhetorical question) or are the Decepticons the bad guys?!! Because as much as I know, they weren't suppose to fight between them selves, as they were at the beginning, when Optimus got back and in the middle of the film, and when they got on the ship to save Optimus and Tessa. When they got on the ship they wasted time, while arguing, WHY?! They went there to save those 2 and then, when they were on IT, the Crosshairs wanted to leave or something - waste of time. If that was suppose to be a funny part of movie, it wasn't at all! Because of such moments movie becomes 2 and a half hours long. And that is too long. Another moment, when Cade, Shane and Tessa are going down from the ship, they climb the metallic ropes and the robotic hounds are following them. One moment behind Tessa, there are 3 of them and suddenly they are gone and then they appear again. Should see that big details. Oh, and the thing about OPTIMUS - at the beginning of The Film he is damaged and needs repairing, but then suddenly he is fine, he scans the truck driving by and is as new, SAY WHAT?!!!!! By the way Tessa (Nicola Peltz) doesn't look like 17 orlike she is a daughter of Cade (Mark Wahlberg), although the ages are possible. Mark Wahlberg doesn't look like a young paps. :) Anyway the movie was good, just some small issues. Awaiting for the next movie. Galvatron is still there, so I guess, there will be mess again. :D",Transformers - Age of Extinction
495,justgopi,Perfect Transforming - Put your Prejudices aside,8,7 July 2014,"To be frank i avoided watching this in the first week of release and hoped it would bomb at the box-office. Just as everyone else i was sure that this would be just another Bay's average Transformers movie( with the explosions and boom sounds, but, boy was I surprised. By the movie's end i was actually praising Bay and the technical aspects of the movie.Transformers 4 has set the CGI quality bar so high, that no other world cinema might not reach it for at least another 10 years. I don't want to talk about the characters and the sentiments ( we are here for Transformers not for Jane Eyre). Overall the human characters had good screen time and looked fun without too much involvement in the story.Go watch this with your prejudices aside,the movie is worth every penny. To conclude this is way better than the first Transformers movie. Good to see how the transforming happened from a gimmicky action-comedy(T1) to a Kick-ass Action Flick (T4)",Transformers - Age of Extinction
496,AnthonyWatkins,"Overlong, Special Effects-ridden film with poor writing",5,6 July 2014,"Transformers: Age of Extinction opens a new chapter in the Transformers franchise. Michael Bay returns to direct, as you'll easily be able to tell after watching this film. In all honesty, I actually enjoyed watching the first three films in this franchise. They weren't good films aesthetically, but I was entertained. In this installment, however, I got bored---fairly quickly. This film sported new characters and actors, with Mark Wahlberg in the lead. Wahlberg never gets cheated in a film, and in this one he gives an above average performance. Nonetheless, the screenplay in this film is almost unbearable in certain moments. I'm talking ""cheesy"" dialogue. The characters are written fairly well, but at the end of the day it all feels fake because of the poor writing. I should also mention that the first 3 installments in this franchise had (what I thought was) good humor. In this film, the intended humorous moments fall absolutely flat. There's one character who is a friend of Wahlberg's character who tries to lighten the mood of the film and provide humor, but it's an incredibly poor attempt. It's not entirely the actor's fault, as I mentioned before, the writing is pretty poor. Next up is the special effects. Let's face it: when you go to see ""Transformers"" you are going to see the incredible action scenes and special effects. I'll come right out and say it: the CGI in the film is top-notch. However, it's overbearing. The action and special effects take over the story, and you end up getting bored pretty fast (I looked at my watch and I still had an hour left in the film). Oh and by the way, as other reviewers have pointed out, if you bought a ticket to this film in order to see Optimus ride the Dinobots, you'll be sorely disappointed, as there is very little screen time of the Dinobots. This is sad, as Paramount featured them in all of their teasers and trailers in their hope to get a bigger audience. In conclusion, Transformers: Age of Extinction, although it has some good moments, is an overlong, special effects ridden film with poor writing. If you are a fan of literally almost non- stop action and CGI, then this film is your ""cup of tea."" Anyone else can confidently stay away from this installment.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
497,CyberPunkAJ,A guilty pleasure!,7,2 July 2014,"Yes, Tranformers are back, but with a whole new twist. After the third movie, they decided to cash in on the franchise's money making ability. So how does it work? To simply put, this is a visual extravaganza. The plot is not bad, but the execution could've been better. There are new Decepticons for you, so there's that. If you're looking for 3 hours of explosions and giant robots trying to kill each other, this movie is for you. It starts a little slow but the pace picks up real quick, followed by lots of chases, lots of battle scenes and loads of explosion. CGI is really impressive though few parts seemed unfinished or rough.Do not expect a very logical or deep storytelling.

I personally am a huge fan of the Transformers Franchise right from the first Transformers Movie! I have watched every single one of them in awe except for this one! The Whole movie is a miss-mash of Michael Bay trying to keep up with the Trilogy and Shoving this bullshit human drama down our throats with totally melodramatic characters that don't make you care about them at all,its as good as if they weren't even there to begin with! As for the CGI I will admit that there were moments of brilliance but only where the Autobots were concerned but these Bad Transformers had no character at all and their Transforming was some Particle Effect Hogwash and it sucked!Story wasn't compelling at all! The female lead was ugly as hell I seriously wonder why guys say that she is hot and her acting even worse and downright pathetic! The only actor worth mentioning for whatever little acting was that guy from Silicon Valley! Mark Walhberg was totally hopeless he looked like he himself did not know what the hell he was doing! And this human drama and and other nonsense drags on for a boring 2 and half hours till the Ending was a bit of a relief and that's why it gets a 5/10! Shia LaBeouf,Rosie Huntington W,Turturro and Megan fox were a thousand times better and they made me care!For Me the Best Transformers movie was the 3rd and then the 1st and 2nd! but this one is Horrible!

I've never seen so many people complaining about a movie because it lack some story depth but altogether it is what you are looking for a robot movie with awesome special effects.This movie is all you can ask for, you'll get robots, explosions, space ships and even dinosaurs.

500,etschuetz,Not bad,6,13 July 2014,"As much as I want to, I can not give this more than a slightly above average rating. Not that I didn't enjoy the film, because I did. I am one of the FEW alive it would seem that actually thinks Michael Bay is actually doing a good job on this franchise.As for this film, it was a popcorn film. However, the turmoil of trust that the Autobots are experiencing in the film is justified. I don't blame them. The Decepticons are not the primary villains here, either. Actually, we don't see any actual Decepticons in this film. I am not really complaining, as the film does give us a reasoning for why we don't hear from them. They are just as afraid of the humans in the film as the Autobots are.The pace of the film was well done, and felt like it progressed well enough. There was a few points in the plot that felt a bit ""over done"" in a sense that Bay kind of went on his own with the mythology rather than directly from canon as was done in the first three films. Yes, Bay stuck to canon pretty well using a variety of elements from the original cartoons, while altering some of the concepts to fit the needs of the film.The ending opens up wide for a sequel...obviously. Who the villains will be is not outright mentioned, but if you know your Transformers history...bring on the Quintesons!",Transformers - Age of Extinction

502,manhhahlu,Quick review on Transformer 4: Age of Extinction,7,1 July 2014,"Well another Bay's movie about the Transformers and as expected, everything blows and shatters into pieces while giant robots fighting tooth and nail against each other. Can't say that formula worked out well this time around but the film itself is more or less better than the previous installment ""Dark of the Moon"". The bold choice of something similar to a reboot of the series with a whole new cast of both humans and Transformers is indeed a double-edged sword. On one hand it somewhat manages to introduce some interesting characters though the number is too few to be a shinning beacon of the film. However I particularly find the character Cade Yeager whom is portrayed by Mark Wahlbergh is quite a nice change to the series, since he both possesses the toughness and a real passion towards the Autobots (unlike that clumsy crybaby Sam Witwicky). On the other hand, people who are new to the series might find it a bit hard to follow the who-did-what-at-where- and-why on the screen since the introduction and execution were somehow sloppy and confusing at times. About the plot, well, it's a Micheal Bay's production so basically there are 2 sides fighting as usual: Autobots and Decepticons with a mix with an outer space army of Bounty Hunters. The little twist about the Autobots not having the support from the human race seems a little flat and illogical. Also Galvatron, the upgraded version of Megatron was nothing but a big cliché of how the bad guys always vow to return to fight another day (or shall I say at least until Bay could come up with another Transformers movie ?)In a nutshell, go see this movie with an open mind and do not hold your hope high for some complicated storyline or Oscar-worthy performances and you shall have a pretty good time. I know I did.P/s: Dang, the scene when Optimus Prime was riding Grimlock can definitely make up for all of the film's Transformer-sized plot holes. Too bad it felt a bit too short on screen time.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
503,andrenmathers,"This is so bad, that the word bad is not strong enough to describe it.",3,3 August 2014,"I always knew that Transformers is that kind of movie which you watch just to get entertained by the robots and the fights. The previous 3 movies, which even not that good, they are still quite entertaining. But not with this one. Bay somehow can even make the not-that-good movie got worse. The duration was too long. The first 15 minutes was such a waste of my time. You can skip it, and will still understand the story. The hot dude typical cast is completely unnecessary in this one. Without him, the film will be just the same. The girl who played the hot chick, somehow can make Megan fox's acting deserves an Oscar. Yeah, it's that awful. Oh and Mark Wahlberg, such a waste of talent. I feel sorry for him.So, even if you got much idle time and have no more movies to watch, and this is the only one you got left, consider it again, maybe go cleaning your room is worth your time more.And yet the worst part is that there will be more sequel coming up.

504,Megagug,This is what a three hour orgasm feels like.,2,28 June 2014,"Michael Bay's transformers movies have been bashed by critics and some of its fans, but this installment does not deserve any of the hate it's getting! The story and tone are unbelievably intense, the cast is superb, and the action sequences are visually stunning (especially the Chicago and Hong Kong battles).This feels like a completely different movie than the previous three films. Most of the immature humor from the original trilogy, which gives this film a much more serious and adult tone. The violence is heavily amped up, This is not a transformers film for its newer and younger fans, it's clearly made for its older fans that way he'd the show 20 years ago. If you can only see one movie during summer break, see this, film, and if you see it, see it in the largest, loudest theater you can find. You won't regret it.P.s. I have a massage for all of the Michael Bay haters: please stop complaining, these movies will keep being made even if you complain.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

And I must admit, despite what critics say about the first three films, I thoroughly enjoyed them all. The movie started off really well and I got really worked up on how the story will unfold. Cheesy lines, coughing, tobacco-smoking auto-bot, short shorts and high heels in a barn, impossible scenarios... can only be forgiven if Age of Extinction, like other Transformers films, is only 2 hours long. But my God! This went on for too long and without plot. Michael Bay should just retire and leave us with good memories of the Transformers films.

506,mpboylanjr,8/10 ..Bay does it again!! And all the people that constantly bash these movies are still going to see it.. GREAT!!,8,30 June 2014,"First of all.. Transformers:Age Of Exctinction was by far the best movie out of the franchise. Let's get something straight about the guy Michael Bay you all seem to love so much to hate. YES, these are edge of your seat blow up EVERYTHING on Planet Earth and keep on going for almost 3hrs. That being said: you know this is what to expect , especially out of a BLOCKBUSTER Mike Bay style. This film actually put the story in the movie as best as possible with Whalberg, Peltz, etc..etc. so I don't get the whining over the story line. ""Done"" probably to the best way it could in this type of BLOCKBUSTER(again I use in caps because these are what. are all about) . Next Mr Bay has made well over a billion after all said and done so like other reviewers before me, case closed!! People that are even bashing it are seeing it AGAIN. The Dinobots and all the autobots were witty ,cool, and were done flawlessly with actual personality and even funny banter(john Goodman). Example.........One more thing is that Michael Bay makes these movies like no other director right now can and has shown that he is back in the Bad Boys action of old. These huge movies like TRANSFORMERS-AOE. Or even that ninja turtles film coming in august he will have a hand in( sorry for the ninja turtle fans. Haha. It will prob be awesome) he makes these movies so that he can make a smaller film like Pain N Gain..(awesome. Check out if haven't ) Lastly I suggest go see TRANSFORMERS-AOE in theaters in any dimension.. It's fun and does not take a second off.. True action packed madness for almost any movie lover like myself who does love other genres but doesn't hold it to just one and say BAHH to the not so intellectual movies. ENJOY ..........def 8/10 and cannot wait for the next installment.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
507,lexi-guiot,It's better than the third.,7,16 July 2014,"I love Mark Wahlberg! I loved Shia too, but without Megan fox, Shia's character does not make sense... sorry.Its your typical transformers film. I do not understand why people go on and on about how much depth a transformers film should have... get over it. Have you not been watching the past films?!There is a few things that annoyed me about the film which made me grade this transformers with 7 stars.Shane... I really like Jack Reynor, and he is probably going to become really famous soon, but GOD!! Does Shane really HAD TO have an Irish accent?! The accent was horrible, I thought maybe Jack was Australian or something... couldn't he be just your regular American guy? His accent was completely fine in Delivery Man. I felt it was made just like that, in order to justify Mark's character calling him ""lucky charms"".The music and effects are always very good in transformers... but I felt like the film was a bit too long for the kind of franchise it is. At times I was like... oh I completely forgot this character had to make another appearance. And lastly, the tan the girl had... she is gorgeous, and she did not need to look orange and also an actual actress... so why does she had to be the victim all the time? that's why I miss Megan Fox's character, SHE KNEW... but I have to say I prefer this girl than the Victoria's Secret model.Overall go and see it if you like the transformers franchise, Mark is just pure class! Definitely better than the third. Loved that is a father/daughter film.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
508,jvic52,How much more Michael Bay garbage can we handle?!,1,6 July 2014,"If it were possible to give a movie a negative score it would most certainly be this awful piece of Hollywood CGI garbage. I am not one to hate a movie solely on the fact that there is a lot of CGI used. I think it is a great way to help TELL the story and use it as a tool to help move the plot along. But when a movie is entirely based off of CGI special effects action scenes it takes away from the plot itself. In this movie the plot is VERY straightforward, one doesn't have to try and connect the pieces or think too hard on what is going on. If I remember correctly there is a fight scene about every 15-20 minutes all throughout this 3 hour hell ride. By the time the end fight scene rolls around you will be begging for it to be over and quickly.I just don't understand what happened to Michael Bay. He had a few movies that I would consider good, even some that had a solid plot. Special effects always seems to be his Achilles heel but movies such as ""The Rock"", ""Armageddon"", and ""The Island"" all had semi-decent story lines. If you have seen any of his other movies you also know that product placement is something that he always does in his films. You will see advertisements for ""Bud Light"", ""Victoria Secret"", ""Chevrolet"", along with many others. Just another way he has sold his soul to squeeze as much money as he can out of society.Rant over now let us get down to business....Mark Wahlberg, how are you still getting acting jobs? Is it just me or does this guy play the same roll in almost every movie he does. The overly cocky, smart-ass, bad-ass guy who is not to be messed with. He had two terrific performances in ""the fighter"" and ""the departed"" and instead of building off of those two performances to establish himself as a very solid actor he sells out to take cheesy, awful movies. Deep down I don't think he is the best of actors to begin with so maybe this is the best we will see from him from this point on. In this movie expect the exact same character he has been playing only this time he is the father of the ""hot"" girl in the movie. Played by Nicola Peltz who did a so-so job throughout the movie. She had some scenes where she wasn't a complete bore to watch. That was my biggest problem with this movie is that there was just nothing to latch onto. You couldn't sink yourself into the story or into the characters without there being a bomb or other type of explosion going on somewhere. Jack Reynor who played Peltz's boyfriend actually did a good job as part time comic relief part time hero. Hopefully he won't sell out to the teen girl movies I'm sure he's been getting offers to play. Obviously both Reynor and Peltz are attractive individuals, I only hope that their success in future movies is more than skin deep. Kelsey Grammar, Stanley Tucci, and Titus Welliver all give solid performances, or I guess I should say as solid as you will expect out of this movie.So with this sub-par cast, horrible storyline, and CGI special effects action scenes please see this movie with LOW expectations. The plot itself doesn't make any sense. There are so many parts in this movie where I was thinking to myself, ""how did he know to do that?"", ""how did he even get his cell phone number?"", ""how did they survive that?"". My biggest complaint was how Optimus Prime was supposed to be ""fixed"" by Wahlberg because he couldn't function without proper assistance. And then 10 minutes later he fixes himself and turns himself into a ""cool"" semi-truck. There are just so many moments where the story turns on itself because of garbage screen writing. The horrible part was there is no explanation to the questions I had because there is no way to explain it during the movie. Bay just doesn't care anymore because he knows we will continuously pay to see such horrid garbage. IF you see this movie and I hope you don't, please pay attention because I promise you will be asking the same questions I did. If any of this movie is appealing to you and you find it in anyway ""amazing"" do yourself a favor and stop watching movies. This next line is the only real spoiler of this review.... I will bet anyone a million dollars that you can guess how this movie ends!! Yes that's right, Optimus Prime pulls out his giant sword and cuts the evil decepticon robot in half. Exactly like the other three movies. I implore you, please do not waste your money or time seeing this movie in theaters. Wait for it to come out on Netflix, do not give Bay or Hollywood anymore money. We need to wake up as moviegoers.... when will enough be enough. We are smarter and better than this America. The only reason I went to see this movie is because my ticket was paid for me by a friend, I would not spend one cent on another Bay film. Please heed my warning..... stay away from this film at all costs!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
509,naughtydogproductions,Best CGI Film of 2014!!,10,29 June 2014,"-SPOILERS-Transformers 4 brings much excitement to me as a childhood fan and I watched it yesterday (28, June 2014) a day after the actual release in the US (27, June 2014) and I really enjoyed it. There were some exceptionally sad moments like Lucas's death during the explosion Cade, Tessa and Shane were experiencing. I would think that Transformers 4 is outstanding, CGI is better than the last 3 films and the FINAL BOSS was longer than Dark of The Moon, Transformers (1) and Revenge of The Fallen. Lockdown was a psychopathic, mental diseased Transformer. He was on no side in the film but in the Animated show, he was a DECEPTICON warrior. My favorite line from him was ""Autobots and Decepticons, never stop fighting"" Optimus Prime was more brutal and angry in this one. He had his jet pack which we never saw until the end of the film. Bumblebee had like in the first film, a radio-voice. Ratchet was sadly killed about 30-40 minutes into the film by Lockdown. Drift, a samurai transformer was probably the best there. THE DINOBOTS only were on the film for about 15min through the film which wasn't much. Dinobots first appeared 130min in and then to the end where they left. AWESOME FILM! WATCH IT!!!!!",Transformers - Age of Extinction

511,jhanson769,Transformers 4 is much-hated fourth entry into the Michael Bay franchise. But is the hate worthy?,6,13 July 2014,"Now, the Transformers series is not good. It is no Star Wars, no Batman trilogy, no Godfather trilogy. It is what it is. It is a fun adventure ride that is worth seeing for the thrill- which is why the franchise makes all that money. As I said above, these movies are to be watched for the sheer pleasure of watching giant aliens fight and shoot big guns and explosions. So when that doesn't deliver, that is what detracts from the experience. The first act or so does exactly that, which is what is really disappointing about T4. It presents an overly complicated plot and drags on with things that I wasn't interested in. By the second act, the establishment is mostly over, but it continues with a boring plot and uninteresting characters. I will give it this, though- act II ends with a stunning and completely awesome action scene rife with incredible music. But, the third act is what action fans are seeking. There is 45 minutes of non-stop action and explosions- not to mention Optimus Prime riding a dinosaur. Although it does slip up with the repetitive action sometimes, the script turns right around and adds in some ridiculous, albeit fun, scene. The third act is also where the comedy kicks in, especially from Stanley Tucci. I don't normally like him and his humor, but here, he had me laughing even after the credits rolled. All in all, if I were expecting more from this movie, I would have liked it less. But the ending of this movie left me satisfied after the unimpressive beginning and middle. If you go see Transformers 4, don't look for much. Suspend disbelief, sit back, eat some popcorn and enjoy the show.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
512,dvdurst08,Transformers 4 is excuse driven,5,30 June 2014,"I thought the movie was decent at best, they did a good job with the cute girl drawing attention and Mark Wahlberg's background as a struggling inventor having interest in the greatest tech discovery of his life in the autobots was a good plot intro. Even the auto bots being hunted was a great touch, and humans trying to find out how to make their own versions was a creative, and while understated part of the movie, good area. That being said the story other than that was very week. A government cover-up, evil transformers after Optimus Prime, and a human family caught in the middle. This is just a non space, on earth third movie just with dinosaurs. There was little explanation as to how with all the tech upgrades in the world we have no idea that this ""government organization"" is hunting transformers along side other transformers. That Kelsey Grammar is basically running the defense department in a crooked direction, and that the biggest tech company is creating human transformers and NO ONE KNOWS! A transformer bounty hunter and we have no background info on it from Optimus. Talk of the creators, and knights and no info on it!? These are just simple plot holes.Overall the lack of explanation doesn't fit, and the simple ""we are the government"" excuse gets old like 30 minutes in. Mark simply wasn't enough to overcome the short comings of the plot.... and there were plenty of them. If the action is all you are looking for than this movie is great, but sadly the plot problems are just too obvious, in my mind as a movie buff, to enjoy if fully. 5 of 10 maybe 6 at best.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
513,spacian379,Garbage,1,5 July 2014,"Dear Michael bay, please stop making Transformer movies. We beg you.--The fans Oh where to start......I am still a fan of the first Transformers film from 2007. Yes it is rife with plot holes and all the things from Michael Bay's bag of cinematic tricks I've come to hate over the years (overuse of slow-mo, cheesy lines, weird lighting, lens flare and more explosions than Afghanistan on a bad day), but it is still entertaining at the very least. From that point onward, the series has fallen from grace faster than your average Africa dictatorship. ""Revenge of the Fallen"" was dreadful and ""Dark of the Moon"" was barely tolerable.Age of Extinction is garbage in every meaning of the word.The movie takes place five years following the events of the last movie and focuses of U.S government attempts to eliminate the last remaining Transformers from Earth as part of some poorly explained alliance with a transformer bounty hunter whose character development begins and ends with ""change into a Ferrari"". This is coupled with another poorly constructed story arc concerning a tech corporation using melted down transformers to create a new generation of U.S military robots. Thrown into this mess is Mark Wahlberg and a cast of forgettable side characters. When Wahlberg (I can't remember his character's name it's that forgettable)finds Optimus Prime wounded in a movie theater (?), the government is tipped off and tries to destroy him for reasons I'll leave out for the sake of spoilers. The nearly three hour orgy of explosions and shaky cam laden chase scenes begins as more characters nobody cares about, including the last of the Autobots emerge to fight whoever the villain of the story is.This here is one of the biggest sins of the film. By the end of the film the protagonists are fighting not one, not two, but three villains, none of which is properly developed with the three hours of this movie. They are bland, without proper back story, and Kelsey Grammar. On top of this is the constant punishment on the senses that is Michael bay's signature brand of CGI destruction porn, thrown helplessly onto the screen to save the sinking calamity of a franchise this film represents.Coupled with the terrible story written by the same person behind the Razzie winning ""Revenge of the Fallen"", there is Steve Jablonsky's poor attempt at another action score, more lens flare then Star Trek, enough slow mo to annoy a snail, weak acting overall, and a hastily put together ending that leaves one contemplating why you just wasted the last three hours.If you want a bad movie to laugh at and brutally murder three hours of your time, this is it. there is nothing of serious quality to be extracted here. The only positive thing I can think of coming from this movie is the performance of T.J Miller. I only say this he reminds me of his performance in ""How to Train Your Dragon""; a film that even at it's worst is infinitely superior to this travesty.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
514,elliesaavedra,Are we really a country of stupid people?,1,2 July 2014,"This is not the kind of movie I usually watch, but my husband and I couldn't say no the couple who invited us to see this film. So, off we went, without really expecting much. But really, I didn't expect it would be SO BAD! For the record, I saw the first Transformer movie on TV years ago, and even if it wasn't a masterpiece, at least it was watchable (but I agree that Wahlberg is better than LaBeouf, as several reviewers have said. But then again, so many other actors are... :) ) OK, let me sum it up: the script sucks, the story sucks (as in: plot holes an airliner could fly through), the photography is as clichéd as it can get and so is the direction. Mark Wahlberg manages to find a decent performance --albeit barely--, but most of the lines are so hokey, you can truly feel his embarrassment while acting... So, how about the special effects? Well, I'm not arguing the technical aspect because I don't work in the film industry, but really there's nothing you haven't seen before. Maybe just more explosions than usual. As if we needed more of those...Which brings me back to my original question: are we really such a stupid country? Judging from the reviews here, I would say no, and that people do get that these productions are sheer trash.

His purest form being hot women, all-around good looking leading characters, depth-lacking plot, and of coarse EXPLOSIONS. While Unrealistic scenarios and somehow hints of sexism seem to be Bay's bread and butter, it must be working because this movie has already made upwards of 400 million dollars. All the flaws aside, the film is visually enjoyable. Mind boggling special effects make for a 12 year old's dream movie. Children will worship this movie while grandparents will complain about the loud sounds and all around the world this film will anger critics and be praised by people who simply want to be hypnotized by explosions for almost 3 hours.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
516,abiramone,Lower your expectations. Just fasten the seatbelt and enjoy!,7,7 July 2014,"I came to the teather to see a movie that has replaced How to Train Your Dragon 2 in some studios because its massive hip. All of my friends said this movie is worth it. As a fan of the series -even with the garbage second movie and a mediocre third one- I know what is it gonna be. We know how Michael Bay made flicks, we know how shitty story he got in almost every movies he made, We know how he shot the scenes. Everything has been so clear. So deal with it.The casts are a lot better, thanks to Wahlberg who did a good job delivering such as a bad dialogues and lines into something enjoyable. Tucci is somehow entertaining. The freshmaker Nicola Peltz -who has grown up really great- has done her job to be something we've been missed from Megan Fox from the first one, but with even better acting. And her secret boyfriend whateverhisname is, although being such a dick to Wahlberg character in the whole movie, has done his part quite well. But the supporting characters seems quite annoying. All the Chinese characters looked unnecessary. And all the bad guys, just Kelsey Grammar is the one who is really promising.The story, although it runs pretty fast and has plenty of plot holes that makes me somehow confused, is enjoyable. A lot of questions came up just after the credit titles rolls. Why Optimus has to fly around the galaxy to find you-know-who instead of just investigate the giant-ass spacecraft that has a lot of evidence to get the exact location? Like its prequels, the transformers become somehow clean and colorfully shiny when they come up as the vehicle mode but broken and scarred when in robot mode one? And don't forget the fact that in every transformers film, they have their own oddly special gadget that being the problem. The first one has allspark, second one has 'the matrix', the third one has 'the pillars', and this one got 'the seed'. and why it has this kinda stereotypes? that's Michael Bay.the almost-3hours-fake-3d-flick has a darker tone than its predecessors. the jokes are somehow more enjoyable rather than the other three although they are still not that funny. The usual shitty slow motion Bay got in every movies he made, isn't that bad in this one. its not over-used and fits to the entire scenes.Something that I really don't like is, although I know that the purpose of making the colors of autobots are that catchy is because it has to be that way to fits with the original characters, but I still don't like it. Why the production designers have to make it all shinny and high saturated? looks like they are all fancy new cars and not war robots. and why they change Bumblebee into the new Camaro one? the vintage one is really badass.The ending shows the fans there are gonna be more sequels. And i'm looking forward to see how Bay and the studios deal with the critics to make even the better one.

This is exactly what the film was supposed to be action packed and the story line flowed well and giving us a little more incite to how the transformers came to be. As for the length of the film, well again user reviews I need to take with a grain of salt. The film finished and I had to look at my watch to believe 2 hours and 45 minutes had flown by.

Filming is not 30 minutes plot building, 2 hours of explosions and 12 minutes of closing including credits....Hands down the most awful movie of the franchise and not because of the actors but because of the seriously lacking plot and heavy explosion stuffing.I have seen my share of bad films but this was literally 90% CGI and 10% acting of which from the whole duration of the film it was exploding scenes for more than 80% of the whole viewing. To all producers and Hasbro : read the reviews and get a new director for the next film.

Remarkable work of digital technology. The story line up was not the best of its kind but considering it was a Sci-Fi movie, it was DECENT ENOUGH! Mark Wahlberg did a good job with a little role he had in the movie. He was funny at times and serious too. His Daughter and her boyfriend (of which Mark Wahlberg did not approve)were a typical Hollywood teenage side to the movie. All in all the movie is more than worth the money you pay for ticket.

China allowing an American company to develop alien-grade technology on their soil? Happens every day. Mark Wahlberg a genius? You've gone too far. Questionable casting and unexplainable explosions aside, this movie was about as easy to follow as a Quentin Terentino rant. Between the C.I.A., K.S.I., the Decepticons, the sniper headed thing, and ""the creators"", I couldn't figure out who it was the Autobots were actually fighting against. My hypothesis is that Michael Bay spent so much building an entire set out of kerosene and black powder that he didn't have enough left over to hire writers. All in all, this was a great movie for escapists but a terrible movie for anyone looking for more than explosions and fight-scenes. P.S.

522,trent-26321,Continuing the Downward Trend,4,25 August 2015,"The Transformers trend of getting a bit less desirable with each sequel continues in this fourth installment. The first film captured our attention, the over the top explosive directing style of Michael Bay was a great fit for the lovable goofiness of Shia LaBeouf and the sexiness of Megan Fox. The Second film did its best to continue this trend, but there wasn't anything really captivating about it. The second film was a sequel in every essence, simply another title in the chain. By the Third Film the audience was lost, and deservedly so. With the second film ending in its pivotal romance between Sam and Mikaela and their confession of love the audience was shocked to see the third movie open without Megan Fox (Mikaela). In fact they did not only make her absence glaringly obvious, they had the distastefulness to force another woman (by showing her in her panties in the opening shot) into the mix without any kind of explanation beyond ""she dumped me"". To add insult to injury for some reason Sam retained custody of Mikaela's dog. The entire third movie could stand quite well, or better, without the new girlfriend Carly. Which brings us to the Fourth movie in the franchise. The most utterly disappointing one to date. Basically all connection to the first 3 films is erased and we are given Mark Wahlberg as Cade Yeager, a struggling inventor and engineer. This film relies on the father daughter relationship as a crutch mostly to push the storyline forward, which it sorely needs. The movie starts dreadfully slow and then suffers enormous pacing problems at the end when the giant battle between Optimus and his enemies drags on for a seemingly endless amount of time. Most of the fighting is extraneous at best, all done as eye candy which by now the audience is quite tired with. In the end the movie is probably an hour longer than it should be thanks to these extra fight sequences that last far too long, the father daughter ""surprise boyfriend"" chemistry is boring at best, the plot seems unsure who is the bad guy: The humans or the alien robots, and there are no moments where you feel surprised or thrilled; its all the same material.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
523,paulortiz12,I feel emotionally numb,3,8 August 2016,"I just watched a truck that transforms into a robot ride a robot that turns into a dinosaur and it did absolutely nothing for me.I don't know if it's bad CGI, sensory overload, a lack of connection to the characters or an understanding of why they're doing anything, bad dialogue, bad acting, a forgettable soundtrack (mostly consisting of the same motif played in different keys) or maybe all of it combined. But after the tenth slow motion shot of a robot tumbling through a cloud of debris I was pretty much done.There's a place for cartoonish action scenes, and given the premise of the movie I'm not expecting realism. But nothing made sense. There were so many scenes where heat, deceleration or flying shrapnel *definitely* 100% would've killed all of the main characters dead. I just couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to enjoy what I was watching. Look don't get me wrong - I enjoy big dumb movies. But they have to be done right. Every ounce of nuance or dynamic was totally compressed out of this film. Every line of dialogue is slammed and smothered in futuristic SFX. Every shot is a detail-filled clusterfudge of ""stuff"" with no discernible purpose.Oh and another thing - a LOT of people die. Like, it's never shown? But when a robot puts his fist through a bus, you know a whole bunch of Christmases just got ruined. But there never seems to be any sense of weight to these implied deaths. Everyone just keeps spitting out their one-liners and acting as though no-one else in the world matters.And the product placement. My god the product placement. You could tell they were putting certain scenes in because x company paid x amount of money for x amount of screen time and they're obliged to fulfil their part of the deal. Slow panning shots of Bud Light on the ground. A pair of Gucci sunglasses glistening in the sun in front of a Coca-Cola truck. Overly prominent Victoria's Secret signage. I'm not making this up.I'm late to the party but ya know, I decided to chuck it on while I did some particularly boring work.

Better lead, better characters, better humor, action is the same caliber (the only aspect that made the other ones barely watchable but forgettable), and the story was better. Bay is really made fun of for lacking story telling, but I feel his best movie is ""Pain & Gain"". So Wahlberg is added to this installment and I see why. He's just fun to watch and funny without being immature. This is a long movie, drags a little, but surprisingly more engaging with less patriotic babbling that was hokey previously.

I don't usually go to the movies because of the expense, but we love the Transformers series and couldn't miss this one! I will say this, I wasn't disappointed that I paid $13 a person to get in or that I sat there for 3 hours (yes, it's 3 hours long, ration your soda). I did however leave confused and shaking my head. I tried to give it a few days to sink in, but nope, I'm still confused. The action was awesome, the graphics were great, the acting was superb. The storyline was absolute trash. It was like every writer had a different story they wanted to do and the director said ""F*%$ it...do them all"". There were too many bad guys and none of them with a clear story line as to who they were, where they came from, and why they were after the Autobots. Most of the original transformers we've come to love are brutally murdered (??) and replaced with a weird mish-mash of strange second wave transformers...a Samurai, a green dude styled after Nemo from the Matrix, a fat rasta bearded John Goodman (????)...I don't even know. Marky Mark is awesome but his daughter is a useless character, unlike the Megan Fox of past she written as an asset but spends 2 1/2 hours doing nothing but whining and crying...He's focus is her and her virginity, but he blows nothing but hot air when her racer boyfriend comes out of the wood work. Several key characters show up for less than a minute and never turn into anything, leaving gaping holes in the story, and don't even get me started on the Dinobots.Dinobots only make a very confusing appearance during the last 30 min or so...little explanation of where they came from and what their purpose is, they're animalistic in nature and behavior and then unleashed to freedom on China...????Also, maybe you have to read the comics (is that a thing? - I just saw the cartoons) but when did Optimus become a Knight - let alone on of the 14 knights...who are they, what was their purpose, where did they go???? What is happening??? And why wouldn't he search the ship for clues to his creators and where they are on the ship sent by them to clean up the mess of his existence (true part of the story line) instead of shooting off to space on his own searching the galaxies for them??!!Omgoodenss, there where at least two or three movies rolled into the hodge-podge of this 3 hour masterpiece and I would have gladly waited a little longer to watch each story unfold in it's entirety than have my head explode from too many inconsistent shorelines and characters. The worst part is that many of the characters, like Optimus weren't even developed well and have conflicting personalities and lines through out the movie...so not only are you confused but that's not even the way they would talk or feel!See it, love it, but know it for what it is...inconsistent and senseless.

527,bigzach2008,"Messy and disjointed, but still fun and enjoyable for its target audience",6,29 June 2014,"While ""Age of Extinction"" may not be a solid movie, it is definitely a somewhat enjoyable summer blockbuster for its target audience.The plot and storyline may not be structured in solid fashion, but it does manage to open up the film franchise into a whole new side of the Transformers universe and mythology as well as keep the action moving forward. Now let's be honest, the action and special effects are the real reason why we go to see these kind of films, not the storyline/plot.It is undeniable that the movie is full of plot holes, unanswered questions and lack of character development, but these do not stop it from being the fun and ""somewhat"" OK thrill ride that it is.Its somewhat better than the sequels that came before it (Revenge of the Fallen & Dark of the Moon), but only second best when compared to the original 2007 film.This movie is filled with really good ideas that could have helped make it a much better film if they had been utilized more effectively to develop the plot, story, characters, and action. The anti-transformer government movement forcing the Autobots into hiding , the KSI agenda to create and control its own transformers, the Decepticon resurrection/revenge plot-line, the Dinobots, and the Bounty Hunter Villain, Lockdown (who I thought was really cool and interesting) had so much potential, especially if he hadn't been killed off in the end and instead had survived for future sequels.

Was there a real storyline? Not of any note. Was there depth to ANY of the characters? Absolutely not. Was there a smokin' hot chick? Well... yeah. It was a strung together bunch of shallow characters who had earned no emotional investment from the audience, punctuated with explosions at every turn. The whole bit about father being overprotective was just way overdone, to the point of it being a parody of itself. ***Possible vague spoilers below, but how can one spoil something that's already gone so very bad?***Ascribing human personalities to these ancient beings is also absurd - for instance, we now have Autobots in the flavors of bearded hillbilly and samurai warrior. I can appreciate that yes, it is a comic-book movie. And yes, they will stretch credulity. The point is, even in cartoons credulity does have an elastic limit. They should keep machines as,.. well, as machines. No human personalities and character traits, if you please. Finally, we have the length of this awful, awful bit of directorial self-indulgence. I liken this film to being subjected to that torture I've heard of where they tie you down to a rack and tie a bowl over your torso with a rat in it. Eventually, you just pray for it all to end, but the torture continues until the end is just a distant fantasy and you reconcile yourself to a purgatory of hopeless agony. ...I do not recommend this movie. ...to anyone.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

The interesting part there is a new transformer named Lockdown and the human created ones, Lockdown he looks more advanced compared to other transformers, and would have loved to see him fight, only you get to see him give a serious fight the last 15 minutes of the movie. The other problem is that the movie is so long, although there is some action-packed scenes and nice visual effects but with poor plot, script and poor acting you'll wish the movies to end, the only thing kept me watching I wanted to see Optimus prime fight with Lockdown and how it will end.Well, like i said its an okay movie, is watchable and I would recommend to go watch it, but don't expect something special..Viwe Kevin Lolwane.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
536,mog1254,What a waste of almost 3 hours.,2,14 July 2014,"While I wanted to like Age of Extinction, I just couldn't. Why? Because there was NO character development, and the movie was just driven by Michael Bay's signature crash bang boom explosions mayhem. I couldn't find myself having any empathy for the characters as they were just cardboard people running around. I like Mark Walhberg in so many films, yet he wasn't given much of a role to fill here. I was appalled at the amount of cursing in what is supposedly a ""kids"" movie, and that it had so many curse words not only turned me off, it sickened me to the point that I wonder what's acceptable any more in what a ""kids"" movie is supposed to be.. The sexual innuendos in all the Transformer movies aren't necessary to drive the plot. Just like the other movies, T: AofE is just a TV commercial drawn out to an almost 3 hour conclusion. I was very surprised to see a movie geared more towards adults with the language and sexual themes than any focus on making it kid friendly.

539,Tioanbeast,"Great Action and Likable Characters, Best Transformers Movie.",8,8 July 2014,"The only spoilers will be very small points not any major parts.Now don't go into the movie expecting to be amazed or anything, but you will enjoy it. Unless your very picky about the portrayal of the Dinobots, I heard someone coming out saying ""worst transformers movie"". But I liked it and it's a much different film than those before it.Human Characters This was the best improvement. We went from a Spoiled Teenager who wants everything handed to him with his hot stupid girlfriend(s) and his annoying and odd parents, and then a bunch of other characters you don't need to know. But in Age of Extinction, We have a father inventor who cares for his daughter (who also looks after her father) then a Sports Car driving Teenager. It's kind about the father letting go of his daughter and there are some other cool interactions with them. There are also many many Dynamic characters which are so awesome. One of the characters changes from a character who you hate to someone you would consider one of the ""good guys"". VFX - The Trailers don't do it justice. At first look, I thought the new Optimus looked kind of dumb but he wasn't too bad. And the VFX were awesome. Possibly the best in an already VFX heavy series. Other Visuals and Sound - Awesome Soundtrack and of course to Sound Effects of Transforming and such was great. The Cinematography was fairly good, I like Micheal Bay's Visual Style. Conclusion - You may not like Micheal Bay, and I sort of agree he's not the best, but he's getting better with this and Pain and Gain. Now my final thought is that this is not the kind of movie to watch on a small screen or on DVD. The absolute minimum this should be watched on is Blu-Ray with Surround Sound. This may sound like a sales pitch but, you can't fully enjoy this movie till you see a Dinosaur eating robots on a 20 foot tall screen with the soundtrack blaring.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
540,gozo200x,Utter rubbish,2,17 October 2014,"I didn't think it possible to make a Transformer movie worse than the 2nd one, but compared to Age of Extinction Revenge of the Fallen was quite watchable. I still cannot believe how terrible the editing was. No rhythm, no style, no sense - like a rough cut done by a rookie. I guess the editor quit early, because he/she couldn't stand to watch this garbage of trite, senseless dialog (if you can call it dialog rather than strings of words we all heard 10.000 times before), ""action"" without purpose and sexist camera angles any longer. I really did like the first one, which was a fun ride, I could tolerate the third, but the forth I'll never ever want to watch again. It's not even possible to pick at the ""plot"" or the ""characters"", because there simply wasn't any of that. Plot, who needs it, if you have the money for hundreds of full cgi slow motion shots that tell absolutely nothing. If, for a moment, I try to ignore that there was no story to follow, there's still that this whole ""world"" that's so elaborately created, has no physical rules whatsoever. Transformers may crush the concrete floor in one shot but seem to have no weight at all in the next. Bad transformers are destroyed by a hit but human beings survive explosions right next to them. Optimus removes a sword stuck in his own torso, then kills a bad guy by sticking the same sword in his torso. Elevators stay open, because the scene isn't done. Metal (""Transformium"") can suddenly fly through the air but when it ""manifests"" (or whatever) it's apparently heavy. Your brain tries to find some guidance to make this fantasy world believable, so that you can at least enjoy the spectacle, but it's not possible, because this is lazy writing and filmmaking at its worst. It's without structure, without any coherent idea and without a spark of intelligence. Also, I have to point this out again, it's really disturbing how the camera treats the daughter. Yes, Megan Fox was eye candy in the first as well and the shots also focused a lot on her body, but it was still done in a way to make us (also) see her like the main character did, so it told a (tiny bit of) story and transported some emotions. This is no longer the case here, the camera work on Nicola Peltz is simply creepy. And I'm a man and usually don't mind looking at hot women. All in all this movie is like a cry from Bay: Don't watch this! Don't make this a financial success! So that I never have to do another one. But, alas, he failed with that as well. I am also looking at the Chinese audience and ask: Really? (300 million US$ box office!). And my fellow Germans? (Almost 40 million US$ box office!) I gave the second star for all the people who worked with so much skill on the special effects, albeit it was all in vain.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
541,abbottsam,Haters gonna hate. Reality is it's exactly what it's meant to be. Don't hate. Embrace the fun!,7,29 June 2014,"Most of these reviews are done by tenth grade A/V club hipsters. It's okay guys. It's okay to like a popcorn movie! Go on, be the first one of your group to say you like it. I bet you one of your friends will come up to you later in private and say, ""You know, I kinda liked it too, but I didn't want to sound un-cool"" (Having said that I still think the second film was an abomination!)But generally I still think many people need a reality check. Were you not entertained?! This is a movie, a piece of escapism. This kind of movie in particular is something that is meant to indulge the senses and make us go 'wow'. For people of my generation there is also a sense of nostalgia in watching characters from my childhood brought to life.There are some negatives, let's get them out of the way first. Over-Americana and the sappy family sob story. That's one. Product placement is really starting to get over-the-top. That's two. The final cut didn't seem to transition as well as the other films. The vehicle sequences and many other scenes didn't have the depth to convince me they weren't green screen. That's three. You know what, that's about it.Other reviews will tell you that it's just more of the same, more of Bay up to his usual tricks. Yeah, it's unmistakeably a Bay film, but he has learned. The robot story arc is given more real estate here over the human characters that over-took the first three films. This film is about Optimus, the origins of the Transformers, Lockdown and the human races advances in technology as a result of the Cybertonian presence on Earth. It's overall got a darker, more sinister tone and we start to see a little more character development, particularly with Optimus.Yeah, it's Bay. It's a 165 minute rocking music video clip. But what's wrong with that? Again, I ask you, were you not entertained?!The story isn't much, but it doesn't need to be. It's enough to give us the action we want. It's also enough to open up the Transformers Universe into something that has much more possibilities in it for future films. Is Unicron looming in the background in the same way Thanos has been in the MCU? We'll see in a couple of yearsIt's five years after the Battle of Chicago. Human politicians have outlawed all Transformers for the war they have brought to Earth. Optimus and the surviving Autobots were granted refuge on Earth as long as they stayed hidden. This is why Optimus and Bumblebee are in real old school alternate modes at the beginning of the film, to stay hidden.Intergalactic bounty hunter, Lockdown has formed an uneasy alliance with some CIA heavies, the head of which is in league with the head of KSI, the company who has developed the technology to build man-made Transformers. We don't see it, but we are told that Optimus barely survived his first encounter with Lockdown – his spark barely operational, we first see Optimus in stand-by mode.Face facts guys, it was awesome to see Optimus in G1 spec alternate mode. You asked, you received – yet you still criticize.Cinematography = awesome. Action = awesome. Soundtrack = awesome. Visuals = awesome. Nicola Peltz = Awesome, and added comic relief when needed. I seriously don't know what you guys want?!The possibilities now are endless and we are likely to see the TU open up into a fully-fledged robot space opera. I get the feeling humans will start to appear less and less over the next few filmsPeople seem to have a hissy fit that Bay's films are not like the cartoons. Really? You don't say?! I for one am happy to see a little re-inventing going on. It keeps it interesting and the re-invention of some key characters in this film is actually more fitting with the events of previous films. It makes more sense than if they were pressured to remain true to the cartoons or the cartoon film. They're creating a stand-alone mythology of their own and the reality is that it's quite cool.

Right from the get-go I felt something was up. I remember thinking to myself in the first 10 mins of the film...are we going to see everything from a low angle, tracking and panning for all dialogue scenes??? Luckily it merged into a more traditional style for most scenes with dialogue. Aside from Michael Bay who at this point in his career seems to have no respect for his audience, I feel sorry for all the creative people that worked on this film. Yes, there are some great special effects....which we have seen 3 times over already....and that's about it. Again, the plot is find the mcguffin for what ever reason, who cares, f**k you! The script is terrible, the human characters are all unlikable albeit an honest attempt by Marky Mark working with vomit inducing dialogue. Dinobots, Lockdown, Knights of Cybertron and 'Creators' should have been the focus of the story but sadly, it felt like an after thought. And what the hell is up with crew members ending up in the final cut of this film? I noticed crew members appearing 3 times in this film. Did they employ a monkey to edit this film? Or does Bay just not give a sh*t? I'm thinking the latter. Continuity is off the f**king charts too. Yes, I knew this film was going to be another dumb bloated toy commercial peppered with more commercials for other crap, which is fine, BUT....

544,starscream7-568-490333,A Wasted Opportunity,2,28 June 2014,"So I went to see Transformers: Age of Extinction on opening day. And boy, was I excited. In my opinion, it had an open opportunity to be, at the very least, a decent film. It had the concept of a reboot - an entirely new human cast, a mostly new robot cast, a new setting and a darker tone. And perhaps the biggest point of seeing the film was the Dinobots! Whoa! No matter what, you had to be convinced to see this film. So I watched it, anticipating the opportunity to be used wisely. And was it? No. I mean  what happened? Not only did they mess up  they messed up so badly that I left the theater thinking, ""I actually didn't enjoy that by the very end"". It's long, it's full of action, it's low on story - so why was the film so bad? 1. The Human Cast: Several of the human characters in this film were actually very good - Wahlberg and Tucci were two that did excellent in their roles. But the relationship between Reynor and Peltz's characters felt like a sudden, dragged-on, forced experience that was barely convincible. Others were just pointless additions to the cast. 2. The Autobots: I enjoyed how much screen time the newcomers Hound, Drift and Crosshairs got. They had some personality, but they still felt like background characters who we knew little about. When they appear, that's that. We have our cast. 3. Bumblebee: Bumblebee has gone from being an audience-favored character to a barely-seen background character who displays no emotions and no real role in the film. His relationship with Sam in the previous films helped a lot. Here? He does nothing. 4. Optimus Prime: I liked how Optimus was run-down at the beginning of the film. Humanity had turned on him, and so he did the same to them. But as a leader, Optimus turns into a violent warrior who is a menace to everyone around him. When he finds the Dinobots, he threatens to harm them if they do not join him. This is NOT Optimus Prime!!! 5. All the Autobots from the previous films have died, except for Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and Brains (who randomly disappears halfway through the movie). Guess we'll never hear about them again. 6. No Decepticons: If you want to consider Galvatron (Megatron's new form) a Decepticon, then okay, that makes sense. But Stinger and the Vehicons are human-made Transformers, and Lockdown is a neutral bounty hunter. You cannot have a Transformers film without legitimate Decepticons! 7. Continuity: Primarily, my problem with the continuity involved things like Optimus suddenly going from truck mode to robot mode without us seeing, and then he is fighting Lockdown on rooftops for the first time. Well, that's sudden! Small things like these tend to make a big difference. 8. Running Time: This relates to the previous point - the film's running time is 165 minutes. When I found this out, I was actually excited because I figured the film would have so much action and such. But a nearly three-hour Transformers movie actually wore me down by the end. By the time that the Dinobots started tearing up the Vehicons, I actually said to myself, ""This has gone on for way too long at this point"". 9. Pacing: The beginning of the film is a bit boring. It's a long exposition where we meet the human characters. And it was an interesting concept, since the Transformers are in hiding, but I feel that it could have been executed better. The action and plot was drawn out for far too long. Could it have lasted like that? Yes, but with better support. 10. Galvatron's Role: One of my biggest hopes for the film was that Galvatron would have a significant role. Well, no. His role in the film is essentially a ""glorified cameo"", as one review put it. I was at least hoping that we would get some development out of him but we didn't. Galvatron could have been a much better character. 11. The Dinobots: This is probably one of, if not my biggest issue. The Dinobots appear in the last fifteen minutes of the film - and not just that, but there are only four of them, they never speak, they are never named, they are randomly thrown into the film just because they're cool characters. And when they join the Autobots, it is extremely forced and rushed. I'll be honest, though, it was awesome to see them in the film. But they came in at a horrible time. 12. Final Battle: The final battle of the film is, and I hate to say it, an absolute mess. It has everything I expected - robots fighting, lots of explosions, lots of destruction, and it was just too much. It felt like a lot of the film's action was compacted into the final battle in Hong Kong, and it just didn't work. 13. Why do Bumblebee, Crosshairs, Hound and Drift stay on Earth if humans are, as far as we know, still out to kill all the Transformers? Well, that's pretty much about it. All in all, it is an extremely long film, although it does have some awesome action and a few good moments. I appreciate Michael Bay for directing these movies, because if there's anything he does, it's give great action and special effects. But story- wise, it's a problem when it goes on for three hours. If you're wondering on whether you should see it or not, I would say that you should. It's solid entertainment that burns a lot of time. I have given the film a seven out of ten, because while it did have its faults, it had some enjoyable scenes as well. Enjoy!",Transformers - Age of Extinction

The plot twist with Galvatron who tricked the humans was unexpected. Dinobots. Negatives. Ummmm, the daughter. She was terrible. The only thing she said was DADDY and HELP ME. She had the exact same expression the whole movie. She needs some acting lessons. The man made transformers suck.

I'd say only the last 20 minutes were messed up - badly.I have really enjoyed the rest of it. The characters had to built up, don't forget they're all new. The plot is all new too, after Chicago. These all needed time to escalate - somewhere. The view of CGI is beautiful, but that's just a trademark. This franchise was primarily made to entertain You, not for rising deep thoughts; think about that haters.The story, well, that could have been more deeply explained. The motivations of the humans are understandable, more or less. But this new foe. Why actually appears? Why now? For me: It was just dropped in with some made up cause, that's it.The last 20 minutes... come on, that made me a little disappointed. How can I say without spoiler... Recruiting for the last fight, cut, fight, done, cut, kiss, cut, Optimus does his thing, lets roll ending credits. All this happens in 20 mins, roughly. Bam! No cool down, no explanations, no conclusions! It's like: interpret as you wish, use your imagination... The warm-up was extremely long, and no cool down. That's messed up Mr. Bay, badly.So, all in all this movie is bringing what you could expect from it. If you expect CGI and explosions - you'll get them. If you want to see a movie, with a little (to none) needs to think - but want to be entertained, you'll get that no doubt. But, if you want to discuss the philosophical depths of it with your friends, you won't enjoy it. I was totally certain what I can expect from a Transformers movie. The movie delivered that - almost flawlessly.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

With introducing new actors movie becomes no better only worse. The daughter of main character will annoy you in just in minutes, then they try to make this shots of her to make her sexually appealing to us, but sorry but nothing appealing about her just another white girl who is bad at acting. Transformers themselves don't make sense, cant understand when they strong or when weak, the new human made transformers were able to change into small particles and let rocket shot by Prime to fly by, but then in the end of movie all of those transformers got killed so easily. Prime like usual in all transformers movies got his metal butt kicked, and last minute been saved.

550,Incinerary,"If you like lots of action, explosions, and giant fighting robots, this is for you!!!",9,28 January 2020,"I can understand why this movie has a rather low rating. The script isn't the best. So if you're all about the plot, character development, and the overall flow of the storyline, this probably isn't for you. The first half had little action with lots of dialogue which was a little confusing as to who's on whose side and what everybody's intentions are sometimes, but you figure it out. Then the second half of the movie is pretty much all battle scenes and no storyline. I think people are over exaggerating and non-appreciative for the sound and visuals because it wasn't that bad to deserve all the 1-3 star ratings. My other small complaint was this movie felt a little too long. But boy oh boy does it deliver with some epic battle scenes! If you're like me and don't care too much about all those other things I just mentioned, but more so like a good action-packed movie, you'll probably love this. The visuals are just as amazing as all the other transformer movies. There are even more giant robots fighting, very cool cars, and of course explosions. What stood out in this movie was the soundtrack which was hands down better than the first three transformers. If you're an audiophile with a legit sound system, this will blow your mind, literally! And I'm not talking about a wimpy soundbar or dinky satellite speakers, I'm talking a system with 15"" ported subwoofers and 5+ channel bookshelf/tower speakers. It's the bass you need to experience with a movie like this. I only have a 5.1 sound system, but the surround sound is already amazing, and this movie furthermore supports Dolby Atmos, so I can only imagine what that would be like! My subwoofer got a good workout as well shaking the house with all the explosions and other intense bass frequencies. It's not very often the cooling fins on my sub amp get as warm as they did with this movie. Overall, I was still very satisfied after finishing the movie despite the subpar script. I'd say the simplicity of the storyline and endless action make it geared more towards teenagers. This movie definitely has a different overall flow and style to it, so know your preferences before watching this and leaving another senseless 1-star review.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
551,bobbysidhartha,New & Fresh,9,3 July 2014,"First of all, a lot can critic me for giving 9. But I found the new actors & plot are refreshing. Biggest assets of the movie are the Visuals & CG work. Watching it in IMAX screen is awesome.Coming to the actors, Mark Wahlberg is the biggest positive. He is better than Shia LaBeouf although lot of characters were useless & could have edited properly. The dialogues of Optimus Prime were good. Writers tried to humor in vain. First 15 to 30 mins of the movie can be easily trimmed off as it is a bit dragging. The Galvatron should have been more powerful as it makes the plot weak and the story that develops around it is not connecting. Stanley Tucci says the Galvatron is re carnation of Megatron which is not convincing at all. The movie actually picks up the pace only after the Galvatron is activated. Wahlberg and CG effects saved the movie. Dinobots are good but should have been used for more time. But introducing more transformers makes it interesting & creates characters for sequels. All you feel after watching the movie is dis engaging humor & initially drag of the movie.Personally I was not disappointed by the movie as I felt the actors & plot change came at the right time. But as we know we all have different tastes & priorities, your opinion can differ/conflict with mine. Thanks for reading :-)",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Where the hell did this get explained?! Weren't transformers from their planet? Why were none of the auto-bots surprised when this mystery dude shows up? Robots, aliens, dinosaurs, guns, explosions, fast cars, sexy chicks...this could not be more Michael Bay. And it could very hardly be worse. The acting was mediocre at best, CGI was at times very disappointing. They must know this movie is bad. They don't care. They want the money they know people will give. Even though we all know it will suck. Why do we give in? This should never have gotten so many films. Yeah, robots that turn into cars. Cool. Not cool enough for four movies.

Because it's not your style of films. One thing I like about critics giving low ratings, is when the movie triples even quadruples it's production budget basically giving the middle finger to the movie critics. So why not stick to your style of films and leave movies like this for people who want to be entertained by non-stop action. Yes this movie is just like the last transformers movies except a whole lot more action and in my opinion a better cast. It's nice to watch a transformers movie and not have to deal with Shia Lewhatever his name is complain and act like an idiot throughout the film. It was entertaining, definitely a Michael Bay film.

555,brandoncharlesworth,The definition of disappointment.,5,28 July 2014,"Transformers 2007 was fun and dumb and knew what it was. Transformers 2 completely raped and destroyed my childhood as the source material that the first movie respected was crushed before my eyes. Transformers 3 was a massive improvement and is my personal favorite Michael Bay movie. The first trailer for Transformers 4 came out, and I was genuinely excited. Then I saw the movie. Mark Wahlberg replaced the much-hated Shia LeBeouf, and did a really good job and actually affected the plot. Lockdown was a really cool villain and is one of the best in my opinion. Plus, like usual the CG is great, for the most part. The score by Steve Jablonsky was great and finally you cared about Cade Yeager's (Mark Wahlberg) family. However, this film is almost 3 hours, but didn't bother me as much as it did some people, and feels like a retread of Transformers 2007 with more-or-less the same plot. The new Autobots are useless and just reinforce racist stereotypes (nothing new there). Crosshairs, the Italian mobster. Drift, the Japanese Samurai and Hound, the cigar smoking American warmonger. The Dinobots are in the movie... for 5 minutes and felt wasted and only served as trailer bait. The second villain, Galvatron, was also wasted and only existed for sequel bait. You also have all the Michael Bay clichés, sexy women, government people everywhere, pointless love stories etc. The CG for the new transformium transformers looked awful considering this franchise is praised for its visual effects. Overall disappointment, not the worst movie of the year but still a massive letdown, earning Transformers Age of Extinction a 5 out of 10",Transformers - Age of Extinction
556,jeremyk-41-989756,My Favorite of the Films so far,7,30 June 2014,"I am 36 years old and I grew up watching Transformers the cartoon and playing with the toys in the 80's. The franchise had achieved mind share. The plan worked.The first and second live action movie didn't do much for me. The one I enjoyed the most and actually felt something for was Dark of the Moon. Until Age of Extinction. I really enjoyed it.Yes it completely objectifies women and is racist and sticks adverts and bright shiny things in your face but hey, thats life (What are YOU doing to stop this? writing a negative review of Transformers? good for you, that will fix the Human Race) , and this is an allegory to life created by a conglomerative passionate effort of differing perspectives, some corporate, some childish.The racist and sexist elements especially of Age of Extinction could be an opportunity to communicate to children about right and wrong and the way women (and men to a much lesser extreme) are portrayed as objects in our world. Communication is what we seem to give up on these days. Transformers is a franchise but it is also human history. It is some peoples (mainly boys) memories of childhood. And the movie is a live action perspective of this. Transformers aided in the development of self.When i think back now the cartoon instilled in me ideals of morality, honour, friendship, teamwork, valuing different forms of life, and the endless, timeless, continuous , ever repeating battle of good versus evil, positive and negative in the form of Autobots and Decepticons. Messages abound in the film about spite and contempt for life and human brutality and dishonour, racism against man and machine or a perceived lesser form of life, sexism , objectification of women. Standardised beauty in the form of the beautiful men and women and cars, the ""objects"" created by minds that have been programmed by our societies models of beauty. A lot of reviewers seem to have irrational hatred for Michael Bay and Transformers and their reviews are purposely negative and unbalanced, and to create balance they create irrational defence of the creative work by others. Can you not see this people ?! The negative reviews are all filled with the same old criticisms that all the prior movies have gotten, they never really review the film, they run out of things to say fast and start to go through and pick apart the plot and just talk about the stupid or dumb elements. This movie was no ""dumber"" than Avatar. (Unobtainium anyone?)But what I dislike the most is the looking down on people with contempt for enjoying the film. The passion in these negatives seems to be for mocking other peoples passion.Or Transformers of all things represents everything they hate in the world. It would be funny if it wasn't true though, It is a waste of energy you negative multiplying reviewers, find some purpose!We are additive and subtractive beings, positive and negative, but it is the absolutes that are pointless and insignificant but entirely significant and to the point. It is the nature of absolutes. Don't you get it.Anyway back to the movie.Good movie. Easier to follow action and plot. Beautifully awesome special effects. But the key is Optimus Prime, the best of the best, willing to protect lesser forms of life (the humans) and more to the point the human sensory representation of Optimus Prime - the voice of Peter Cullen - You are a Legend.Transformers: Age of Extinction 7 out of 10By Striker Eureka",Transformers - Age of Extinction

It also has that little bit of comedy which is what I noticed the first Transformers has, I have not watched 2 or 3, so don't really know whether they have that comedy sector to it or not. The main reason why this don't have a 10/10 is just for the fact that it is a very lengthy movie and personally, I don't think that it should be that long, I would say a maximum length of 2 hours, if that, and some scenes should have been developed more and others should have been maybe under-developed as they are not as important.

Unfortunately, action is not a story line (Sorry Michael).I'll give Wahlberg a B+ here because he played Cade perfectly, but that doesn't mean it was a good role to begin with. The other people in the movie get a C, and the voice actors, especially Optimus, are still great.I had fun watching this movie and I love the transformers series. It's cool, exciting, and definitely different, but this installment is just not that good. Outside the action and explosions, there isn't really a plot that thickens or twists that really draws you in.

This film has non stop action with special fire power and explosion.

567,terryf-5,Better the second time,6,1 May 2017,"I've been playing with Transformer toys since the beginning, loved the cartoon series and animated movie, but have mostly loathed what Michael Bay has done to my beloved franchise. His first movie was decent, the second appalling, the third passable, and when I left the movie theater after watching this fourth installment, my general feeling was, ""Whatever."" Being a little hard of hearing, I couldn't hear much of the dialog and was seriously confused about what was going on (not that Mr. Bay seems to worry much about telling a coherent story). I had been meaning to get back around to seeing it again at home where I could watch it with subtitles, and I was finally able to do just that. This time, I paid very close attention to try to understand the story and was rather surprised to discover that there was a very nice story that played out in a relatively orderly and logical manner, but with enough unanswered questions to leave you wondering where they might take the story in subsequent installments. Being all too familiar with Michael Bay's brand of humor and obsession with never-ending battle sequences, I had adjusted my expectation and found myself, overall, quite enjoying the film. I liked (or at least, didn't hate) many of the characters, including the main actors. There were also some very cool transformations and special effects. My main gripe with the movie (and I still have many of them) is that Michael Bay just doesn't know when to quit - this movie is entirely too long. He's made the same mistake before. The action sequences are so frequent and so long that I end up getting simultaneously bored and traumatized (never imagined that would be possible). If he could just scale back on the incessant action and ridiculous humor, I might start to actually form a moderately positive opinion of him - but I continue to hope that they'll hand the directing reins to someone (pretty much anyone) else.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

I love his direction so much that I dream about his scenes. The scene where Optimus gets new life back was so awesome tha its still giving me goosebumps. The movie is really awesome and it made billion dollar proves the point. Don't go by critics, I don't know whats their problem. The action scenes are just awesome.

It's like they didn't even try to develop a story line. It's over 2 1/2 hours of explosions and CGI with cool but uninteresting characters. I feel like they could have done a much better job if they developed the characters more and had better dialogue as the characters had potential. If you are a child this movie is perfect.

It feels so Transformers. If you like previous Transformers movies, you will like this one.What I like: - Lockdown looks cool even though while watching the movie I was puzzled what this robot is after because in the beginning of the movie it is quite clear he is neither Autobot nor Decepticon. - I like how Megatron plots on top of humans' plots. Joyce feels like he is in control while he was doing exactly what Megatron wants. Simply put, the reborn of Megatron in the form of Galvatron is awesome! - The special effect is top notch (as it has always been since the first Transformers movie), however it seems like nowadays our expectations are already high so it is considered ""expected"". - The overall storyline is great. There is main plot complemented by a lot of sub-plots. - The overall character development is great. Joshua is the one I like most: from being the creator of Galvatron to being target of Galvatron. - I like how Optimus Prime almost gave up on defending humans after being betrayed again and again. Yet, he is an honorable Prime who will always fight for justice. - Dinosaurus Robots are awesome. Hope to see more actions from them in the next Transformers movie.What I don't like: - Cade, Shane, and Tessa character development is so predictable. I also don't see chemistry between Shane and Tessa. - During the battle between Galvatron's army with Autobots, I was expecting to see some significant damage on Autobots side especially because the newly created Decepticon robots were depicted as more advanced in the beginning of the movie. Yet, no significant damage on Autobot side. - Somehow I hate that Lockdown has to die in the movie. - Spaceship sucking metals scene is annoying - Galvatron should have been given more actions like for examples tearing part's one or two Autobots.

577,lifesajourney0,Block Busted,6,28 June 2014,"Transformers: Age of Extinction was disappointing. When I saw the cast, I had hoped for a movie with some more depth of characters and with richer writing and a more cohesive story line than past movies in the series. Unfortunately, Age of Extinction delivers more of the same. The film looks and sounds excellent. The special effects are executed well, as is the cinematography and composition of scenes as they play out on the screen. The film also utilized beautiful locations as backdrops for the action, with one scene fought across the rooftops in China being memorable. The action is well-done, with nice fight and chase scenes throughout the movie, but at times, the action sequences are so long and sustained, it's easy to become desensitized to it and even lost in the point/location of it. Excessive use of slow-motion shots also dull their effect after a while. There are also problems with human beings surviving falls, explosions, and environments that would kill them in reality. The Dinobot sequences were enjoyable, particularly the interaction between them and Optimus Prime. I would have enjoyed seeing more of them in the film. The acting shines in places, particularly where Wahlberg acts scared, exhausted, and/or hurt, which is when he is at his best as an actor. Tucci also shines at times, but often it is against a backdrop of acting so flat that his efforts look out-of-place. At times the acting seems rushed or as if it is part of a rehearsal and not a final cut to be used in the finished film. Grammar and Welliver do well with their bad-guy roles, and Thomas Lennon as an understated Chief of Staff manages to bring a touch of subtle humor to a small role in a movie full of heavy-handed and clichéd jokes. I also enjoyed the Lockdown character's portrayal, digital and acting.Although part of the appeal of the series is displaying robots transforming into real life vehicles and taking that into account, the product placement was frequent and blatant enough to be distracting from the movie, with one company name and emblem being displayed on the chestplate of one of the Autobots. Particularly jarring was a weird subtitle in one scene which displays several models of new cars, all parked at showroom angles, explaining what cars you're seeing. Maybe a second viewing will help with a better understanding of the inclusion of this subtitle or captioning. Overall I give this movie a strong 6. The look and sound of the movie are what keep it from descending into video fodder as well as my enjoyment of the franchise from animation to present. Lots of style and little substance, if you are not a Transformers fan, this may be one to watch at home.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Just like every movie he does, it caters to all ages so it's rather 'balanced'. Graphics and acting ROCKED!.......setting aside the cheeziness from time to time, albeit easily overlooked because the movie is awesome. I'm 41, and used to own Opt Prime the ORIGINAL toy, plus all the Constructicons and many others and I recall always wanting a DINOBOT because who the HELL doesn't like a dinosaur robots??? The MB version of the Dinobots was SPOT F'ING ON! regarding how they are and came to be according to original storyline so F OFF to all those complainin' about the story. Wahlberg was at least equally as good as Shia. Tucci is perfect! Kinda like the Malkovich character but just different. You'll get what I'm sayin' when you watch. Movie waa long at 2:45 but it went fast for me. Ass hurt but whatevs. And to top this off..........I will ABSOLUTELY FOR SURE buy this movie on Blu-ray when it comes out and at to my existing collection and continue to watch again and again and again and again.....................Until I die.Peace! Enjoy the movie!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
579,Coryg59,A Great Experience at the Movies!!!,10,1 July 2014,"Transformers 4 was a fantastic blockbuster film. Far better then the other 3. The new cast blended better with the theme of transformers. The villains were not overcrowded and you could tell what was going on in a battle. Perfect comedic timing and relief. The f/x were perfect, meant to be seen on the biggest screen they got. Seeing Optimus in a struggle having character development was interesting. The plot made sense. Michael Bay is a great director and shouldn't get so much heat for doing what literally every other director does in big budget movies. It must be the ""cool"" thing to hate TF movies, because this one at least is a well made movie production. A great experience at the movies.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Every new version of the movie, they give new version to recreate Megatron & Optimus Prime.It is very ridiculous to see, when they are fighting on the streets, no fighter jets come for support. Every one keep watching how they are fighting. Where is the army, Where is the Navy, Where is the Air-force. The enemy space craft travels at low altitude for hundreds of miles, but know one detects it. Ridiculous.It's fully waste of time and money.

582,kingchris_20,Not sure why all the low ratings here??,10,4 October 2014,"This Transformers movie is very easily the best of the series. It was absolutely phenomenal. Mark Whalberg was 100 times better than Shia, Kelsey Grammar was amazing (along with all the other cast, I mean I thought everyone was excellent), and the visuals were absolutely stunning. I did not go to the theaters to see this movie (partially because of the reviews...big mistake), but I bought the 3D BluRay on release date and it is worth every penny.I see a lot of reviews referring to poor writing/story, but I believe it was the most engaging story of the series. It explained a lot, and all made sense to me. I saw no real plot holes, everything flowed perfectly from beginning to end, and it started correctly where the last left off and follows logically through to where it has left off. It is certainly open to another Transformers movie, and I really hope it gets made and is half as good as this one. Even though this movie was 2 hours and 45 minutes long (some have said ""it was too long""), it was the perfect length. Did not feel rushed, and did not feel too drawn out. I was very impressed with this movie.Other IMDb reviewers and the metacritic critics are wrong once again, they make it seem like this movie is a total stinkbomb, but it was the exact opposite. Fantastic movie 10/10.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Only credit I can give is Optimus Prime, glad he retained dignity. So many stupid plot points like three humans escaping unharmed on an alien spaceship which took ages to launch. For me this was a failed attempt at a sequel. Even for a cgi animation buff, this would be a disappointment. Oh, and who wrote the script? In summary, do something useful like watching cat videos on internet, rather than wasting 3 hours of your time.

Right from the beginning of the movie, it's all Action.I am not going to reveal any spoilers. Go watch it. It's the best movie of the Transformers series yet. Goosebump moments will make you cherish and enjoy the movie a lot.Although there might be a few flaws here and there, it is still a good movie.No offense, but i'd say CAP 2 and XMEN DOFP are way behind this movie. Its because of the storyline and the visual effects. All crazy alien warships, new transformers (the dinosaurs) and the (spoilers) comeback of Megatron.

Obversely the declared goal of Michael Bay was to set the lowest level of consciousness possible, so that even a chimpanzee may understand the story, because there is (almost) none. The only thing you see are uncoordinated sequences of CGI-orgies, accompanied by meaningless dialogs of the protagonists which obversely do anything for money... In the beginning there was so much story-potential in the transformers world, but now there is only a black hole - what a waste... In my case the cinema-audience commented the movie by cyclic collective forehead- clapping - a really rare behavior.

The action scenes envisaged by Michael Bay were of course extraordinary, but the real highlight was the strong character and plot development and amazing casting of actors such as Wahlberg.I watched the film due to my love of the previous Transformer films and because my friends wanted to go and I wasn't disappointed. This film will change my life forever. I don't think I'll ever enjoy an action film again because this one was so amazing.I am out of superlatives for this film.

588,bridg-x,Avergage,5,26 June 2014,"Though the new cast does have some potential, I really feel after watching this that Michael Bay should of left the original Transformers trilogy as it was. This movie milks the transformers for just about any kind of story they can come up with. The plot is awful and when you think it's going somewhere it is just interrupted by a 15-30 min action sequence for a character to then quickly explain what is happening before moving on.Mark Wahlberg really makes a credit for this movie as the main character, however his performance isn't the best we've seen. Nicola Peltz was a surprise, a Michael Bay typical casting choice of a hot blonde who could actually act. Their character developments were extremely poor, only focusing on the simple protective father cliché, it just didn't attach you to the characters like we were to Sam and Mikaela from the first 3 films. The underwhelming plot of the 'seed' where it was only introduced in the last half of the movie and ended up being the central battle. The plot not only being poor but completely convoluted with human made transformers, unknown transformers from another galaxy, a man hunt to kill all transformers and the mystery of the transformers real creators... way too many plot points in my opinion the only interesting one being who actually ""created"" the transformers. The CGI and action sequences were cool and entertaining, but the movie running time being over 2 and a half hours, I honestly got bored, it was dragged out way too long. A solid start followed by a very dragged and convoluted middle and ordinary ending. I wouldn't see the movie again, the original films are much better then this installment. This film had a decent cast but pathetic writing.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

The movie was too long and meaningless. It was more like you're watching some shitty animated cartoon series at home. Too many things happening at the same time. Unable to focus and I don't think so I would recommend it to anyone. The worst part was the length of the movie. My Friends left it half way. Should have been around 100 minutes and that would be more than enough. The only part which was good was the shoot in China and location. That was somehow interesting.

Yeah, Some people say dark of the moon had a bad plot but I really enjoyed it for myself. This time, No reviewer can say Boring, Bad and had a bad plot as they said in dark of the moon and revenge of the fallen. This time, Bay has brought you the biggest Hollywood move and one of the Best Movies of 2014. Effects are amazing (always amazing) and editing is great. I advise you, go see it for yourself, don't let the critics or the reviewers fool you!!!After what we have seeing in dark of the moon and the whole great story of Sam Witwicky, Bay wants to start a new story wants to make his fans satisfied and excited and bring them the best and that's what people can't understand nowadays. The movie was really exciting, the best of the series so far and I give it a10/10 or 12/10 If I could. But really, Bay has done a great effort and that was a huge step. And people who say That they wouldn't watch the new turtles movie coming this august produced by Bay. I say I will watch too and if you hate Micheal Bay or hate this transformers film, I say you cut yourself out of the transformers universe.10/10 And go see it, You won't regret it, yeah it's long but you may find that this film is worth your 9 Dollars.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
594,jcdiedus-611-302934,So LeBeouf is gone....... and its STILL worse??,2,30 September 2014,"I remember having just a few Transformers toys as a kid and also knowing a rich, spoiled kid down the street named Michael who had the entire collection. I was jealous, of course, but what was worse is that the spoiled kid didn't know the Transformers storyline and it was annoying to play with him because he'd use the toys in the wrong way and it sucked the fun out of having access to his incredible toy collection! Watching these movies has caused me to re-live these frustrating childhood memories because another kid named Michael (Bay) also doesn't know the storyline. LeBeouf and all of the CORNY supporting actors all left for whatever reason (thank goodness). Would this mean a more faithful approach to the original Transformers series? SO HOW IS IT EVEN WORSE?! This was a good chance to reboot the franchise, a fresh start, a new direction BUT again the rich spoiled kid RUINED IT !!! This had an even worst storyline and despite the fantastic visuals, action sequences and sleek cars/robots (which is the only reason I rated it 2 stars) - THIS PLAIN OL' SUCKED !! The only good thing is that I rented it and didn't waste anything more than a buck fifty and TWO AND A HALF HOURS !!! It hurt to watch this movie and I couldn't wait for it to end !! For the love of Optimus Prime, spoiled rich kid, if we are cursed to watch another one of your movies to this franchise - - - sacrifice some of your beloved visuals and over the top explosions for good storytelling and good acting!!! Let go of the awful writing and contrived attempt at humor !! Let someone else who is more familiar with the REAL Transformers and give us some hope to watch and re-live childhood memories that made us all fall in love with such a cool series that the Transformers name used to be!

595,ahmedalmuhairi81,"A bit long, but I enjoyed it more than the last two installments",6,29 June 2014,"Unlike many of the people giving this movie 1-3 stars, I went into the theater with clear expectations. I wasn't expecting Pulp Fiction, or Forrest Gump. I was expecting big budget summer blockbuster spectacle, cool robots, and some decent action. On those levels, the movie delivered. I agree with critics that the plot was a bit convoluted (disjointed/non-existent may be a more apt description). Admittedly, the movie could have benefited from some streamlining; it FELT 3 hours long. Also, the choice to kill the coolest damned character out of all four movies (Lockdown was a beast) made me cringe. From a technical perspective, the special effects, sound effects and cinematography were awesome. However, there is a peculiarity here that I haven't seen anyone address. How is it that the transformers were well acted while almost every human actor (excepting Kelsey Grammar) is ""Star Wars Episode II - Hayden Christiansen?"" Furthermore, how is it that Lockdown is so articulate, but the rest of the characters were saddled with such simplistic dialog? That clue leads me to believe that the majority of the dialog/script was intentionally dumbed down. Perhaps to ensure that its global target audience could follow along? It felt as if the human characters were ""talking at"" each other as opposed to conversing with one another.On another note, I have noticed that people keep harping about the misogyny, racism, etc, but let us be honest about the worst part of this movie: Mark Wahlberg gives the worst performance of his career. I was praying that Lockdown was going to kill his annoying ass in the final battle, but alas, God wasn't in an answering mood. The actors playing his daughter and her boyfriend weren't any better, but I had higher expectations for Wahlberg. He made Shia look like Tom Hanks by comparison. I wouldn't mind seeing Bay scrap this whole cast for the next installment. My rating started off at 7, but as I wrote this review I realized that a 5 or 6 was more appropriate. I settled on a 6 because I genuinely enjoyed this movie despite its obvious, albeit anticipated, flaws.This review rambles a bit...like the movie upon which it is based. In a nutshell, this movie isn't as good as the first, but it is better than the 2nd and 3rd installments.

Can't blame Michael Bay though for that as Hollywood as a whole is running out of ideas other than extinction of humans. Even Christopher Nolan's Man of Steel was about extinction of humans. Coming back to Transformer,in one word you can say it is shadow of its predecessors with little tweaks here and there. Like transformer transforming to Dinosaurs, new back drop - China (after all it is important to capture the audience of biggest and fastest growing country in the world) and return of Megatron in new nano transformer version but pity that he is truck now (earlier he was a jet fighter).

I see most films at home but I saw this one in the theatre with my stepson who really wanted to see this. For me it ended up even way below my expectations, which were already very low. Note: I really liked the first one. I don't dislike Bay (even liked Pearl Harbor and Armageddon and Bad Boys II), but this is just simply not very good. It's plain awful actually.

It doesn't go anywhere, you don't care at all what happens to the characters, human or alien and there is literally never any sense of urgency or peril for anyone involved.

I have found flaws in all the Transformers, be it superfluous plot points, demeaning sexism, or the bombardment of metal on metal combat that never seems to solve anything, these movies are all really a farce but the point is, as someone who loves the idea of Transformers, the old-time comic Transformers, this was a rip-off.Bumblebee's character has TOTALLY changed, I don't like it. He is depicted as childish, immature, and petty. The ""plot twist"" was so obvious. There is no character development. As usual Wahlberg's performance is shallow and hard to believe. The whole super hot skinny blonde promiscuous troubled teen bit is so played and the relationship between her (the chick from bates motel) and wahlberg is a hard pill to swallow. the action was spotty as best. at one point, we focused on the human jumping roof-tops and only caught side glimpses of the autobot/decepticon battle going on RIGHT FREAKING THERE! also it is not worth seeing in imax 3d.

The previous Transformers was the worst for me, and without Shea LeBeouf and Megan Fox, I just watched this one to complete the series. But boy, it did surprise me! Of course, at times, the humor is outdated and out placed, but the general storyline was decent. The end was somewhat unexpected and turned out to be good! I loved the Dino transformers, and hope they are included in the future movies too. If you are a transformers fan, you shouldn't really miss this one! I have no idea why so many people have reviewed this to be that bad. Okay, it isn't the best, but it is definitely an entertainer.

602,jacobtaylor2000-883-783374,An excellent film for it's target audience,10,1 July 2014,"First off, I want to say that movies like transformers should be looked at differently. I am a nerd myself, but have always made tried to look at these films in a different light. People who say there was terrible plot, terrible characters, etc. are watching the wrong film. You watch a transformers films for the visuals. Explosions, special effects and fighting robots. and on that front it did very well.This has got to be one of the better films of the series, with new characters and new stories. Mark Wahlberg and the surrounding actors are good in their roles, and the new transformers introduced are interesting. You can tell them all apart from their personality and what they look like, where as in the previous films I could only tell apart Optimus, Bumblebee and Megatron. Shia LaBeouf and his surrounding cast make no appearances, which I think is good, because I liked watching the story from another person's perspective. There are few jokes to be found here, as this installment is much darker than the original. The music is epic, as well as the sounds. Everything you could expect from a transformers movie.When Optimus Prime hopped on the giant steel dinosaur, I couldn't help but think, ""that's awesome!"" and that is what this film is all about. Michael Bay makes popcorn movies, ones where you can relax and watch some explosions. Don't get me wrong, I love other films more, but you will no doubt enjoy this.

This Transformer Movie has got to be the best out of all the other 3 in my opinion. This movie contains more robot scenes compared to humans scene which i thought was a great improvement. Secondly, Michael Bay has and his crew have done a great job in filming and editing etc for this film. The moral of the movie actually delivers a message to the audience which i find all movies 'should' have. Finally, Transformers has amazing action scenes which are just amazing and keeps the audience interested. It also has comedy which i think is great. I could go on and on about how good this movie actually is but i'm just going to say... Its a winner for me (10/10 stars). Recommended!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
604,adampape,2 hours and 40 minutes of explosions,4,5 July 2014,"So after a three year break there is yet another Transformers movie, and was I expecting it to be good, no. I knew it was going to be the same stupid Transformers stuff that was in the last three. That being said, there were a couple of things that made it look like it was going to be better, Mark Wahlberg being the main lead, Dinobots, and Stanley Tucci. But I still wasn't expecting it to be that good. And guess what this movie is? Not that good. Even though it isn't the worst Transformers movie, it's nowhere near being a good one.The movie takes place 5 years after Dark of the Moon and the government is hunting down Transformers, and Mark Wahlberg's character lives in Texas and is an inventor who is down on his luck. Wahlberg does a good job here, especially considering how we have seen how bad of an actor he can be with a poor director. His character is a somewhat relatable guy, and he actually does stuff and helps out during the movie instead of just running around, stuttering, and yelling all the time. Mark Wahlberg's daughter, and her boyfriend however are not in the least bit interesting, or add anything to the story, and their acting is decent at best. The Transformers and other characters are all dumb as well. Optimus and Bumblebee are the returning Autobots, and the ones you actually care about. However the rest are not that good. There's the fat one, the samurai one, um the green one, and that is pretty much it. And the villains don't make sense. Kelsey Grammers character hates Transformers, but he allies himself with a Transformer to hunt down other Transformers, so that he can build his own Transformers. Then his own Transformers get infected by Megatrons dead brain are something and it creates a new villain Transformer. It doesn't make sense, and they should have just stuck with one villain.This movie is not all terrible, actually during the first hour or so, it actually felt like a movie. This might be because there was actually a story. And the characters are given enough screen time maybe not to get you to care about them but at least understand them, also the humor is toned down and some jokes are funny. However the movie soon falls back into the same stupid Transformers thing we have seen for the last three movies. There are some serious problems with this film, the biggest one being the movies painfully long run time. The movie just keeps on going, and going. They could have easily cut off 30 minutes of this movie just in action scenes alone. Also there is a ton of product placement in this movie, there is literally an Oreo transformer and Stanley Tucci holds a Beats by Dr. Dre Pill right in front of your face, and that just scratches the surface. And of course there are things that don't make sense, the hectic explosion filled action sequences that are randomly centered around hot girls, and all the other stuff you'd expect from Michael Bay. Probably the most disappointing of this movie is the Dinobots, or lack thereof. The Dinobots show up around the 2 hour 10 minute mark and get about 20 minutes of screen time. Nothing is explained about them and they add nothing to the movie, besides a cool scene of Optimus riding one.In short Transformers Age of Extinction is a bloated incoherent mess. The sad part is that they are going to make a fifth and probably a sixth because this movie has already made 300 million dollars in just a couple days, so please do not see this movie. Or the next one, because unless they get someone else to direct the next one. These movies are going to be the same.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
605,showderkari,Jawdroppingly awful.,4,28 June 2014,"I was able to sit through the first three Transformers.This one? Nah.The lines were delivered badly, the acting was awful (my dead hamster could do it better, and that says something) and it was basically an encore of the whole Transformers series - only louder and more painful for the head. It was upsetting that I had to sit through the whole thing, because I thought somewhere along the movie, it'll get better. Believe me, it doesn't.I could probably whip up the same formula as the whole series. Add in a damsel in distress (a blonde is way more preferable), nearly degrade the poor lady, bring in the Transformers and add thirty to forty minutes of boring exposition, and then the fight.Yawn.(And is it me or did the director just decided to mix in a little bit of the scene from the Avengers, where the characters are on an alien ship flying across buildings? Seems very original to me.)",Transformers - Age of Extinction
606,jono2000,Not bad Michael Bay... Not bad...,1,26 June 2014,"I am going to be honest here. I went into this movie with expectations of a terrible storyline and not the best acting. Boy, I was wrong! I knew that the visual effects were going to be spectacular and I knew the fighting was going to be amazing. I wasn't wrong. I saw Transformers 1, 2 and 3 when I didn't care about the story of a movie. Those movies were my favorite in the history of anything. Then, I gained a sense of realization. The previous 3 movies aren't my favorite anymore. Their fighting was brilliant. This movie kept me guessing, 'what will happen next?'. Michael bay did a good job. Acting was good. Mark Wahlberg didn't disappoint. I just don't understand how Optimus was stabbed in the chest at the end of the movie and didn't die. He just ditched his Autobots and flew off into space with the mission of hunting down his creators. The Dinobots were cool. They were really the no. 1 reason I saw this movie in the first place anyway. The humor that this movie delivered wasn't bad. I had a laugh here and there.I really liked Drift, he transforms in a Bugatti and a helicopter. But he only had like 4 seconds of fame. All he did was jump over a man made transformer and cut him in half. Best 4 seconds.... The scene where Optimus tamed the Dinobots was fantastic, my favorite scene in the movie. Overall, this movie deserves 9 stars out of 10. I'm buying it on Blu-Ray when it comes out in October or November!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
607,nickmorrell64,Transformers 4,6,2 July 2014,"Well, simply put, this was yet another Transformers ""long haul to the end."" After several ""final"" battles, it finally came to a close, while creating two different plot lines for sequels. These movies have created a tradition of ""total-immersion-action-robot-eye-candy"", and it seems to be a good idea to the producers. But, it just doesn't cut it. I mean, sure, there is super CGI and effects, but there isn't much story to be observed, and the whole human factor is certainly tiring me out. It's a movie about metal robots that come to Earth, but do we really need to focus on the humans THAT much? Some may disagree with me, but I am getting very worn out by it. Also, why didn't they continue the storyline with Shia LaBeouf? It wasn't even explained or referenced to in the entire movie. A small nod would have been enough, maybe Optimus says ""Sam!"" or something when he wakes up, I don't know. In fact, scratch that, I don't really care about the humans in this movie (I'm still waiting for a ""Before Transformers: Wars on Cybertron or something similar.) Anyway, I would recommend this movie to action junkies who don't care much for the story. Anyone who is a bit of an analyst when it comes to movies, well, I suggest stay out, because you may find your hair tufts arrayed around you after you pulled them out fretting over some plot-hole.

609,ntialienado,A succession of unconnected one-liners,3,18 September 2014,"I cannot believe how bad this movie is.It is confusing and messed, but not as movies purposely made confusing. This is confusing because of ineptitude making a plot.The acting is really, really bad. Characters do a succession of unconnected one-liners, and on each phrase, the movie stops, because you need that pause to assimilate how cool it is. They think that your brain is not smart enough to get it.Amateur as a C class movie, as if every phrase intended to be a bad-ass memorable line, no matter if appropriate for the situation; it ends being like Jim Carrey in Dumb and Dumber pretending to be witty, just this time is no parody, but taking itself too seriously.By C class, I mean, do you see how each scene is a cheap copy that intends to mimic a good movie? It breaks immersion, constantly remarking that it is just a bad movie.The movie is boring. Non entertaining fights scenes with no purpose are interspersed, just for refilling purpose. Worse, on middle of the fight, they slow the camera, just to make it last longer, to no purpose, as if the slowness were cool by itself, but with the only effect of annoy you because somebody pressed pause and walked away. Yet it is not enough. Some 5 year old toddler thought that it was a perfect moment to insert a dumb ""witty"" phrase, and nobody had the common sense to see how fool it was, so they made a fat robot say it, but the voice was sticked with scotch tape as if it didn't belonged to the movie. They didn't even cared about the slow motion. The voice speaks at normal speed as if it were casual chit chat.At some moment the camera stops too much on the girl looking pretty. The director thought that the scene was cool, so the camera stopped at it for no reason, and then repeated, and repeated again. Hey, I got it. The girl is pretty and looks at the horizon to show his eyes. Then I get a scene of the girl being pretty and looking at the horizon to show his eyes. Then I get the same a third time.I saw it many times on C class movies, when the camera shows the girl as if that were the argument.The writer had a prescription: put a rebellious pretty girl. Nothing else. Waste time showing how the chick is given clichéd orders from his clichéd controlling father, and disobeys on clichéd ways. Make it unnecessary, boring ""drama"" distracting from the movie, and make it predictable: the girl will never obey, because nothing, and conclude with nothing else. Just made for that. Probably is cool.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

However, I have kids, and sometimes I have to take one for the team. Today this involved taking them to see this film.Pros:It was better than the rest of the series. The ""bumblebee & dumb friends"" strand was gone, and it was more about the survival of the autobots. Great cgi.Cons:WAY too long. Seemed to go on forever. Story not engaging, characters bland, the dinobots hardly featured (missed opportunity!) - they just turned up in the back of a spaceship 15 minutes from the end.Overall, promise to buy it your kids on DVD when it comes out, and take them to the zoo instead. 4/10",Transformers - Age of Extinction

613,TheBlokes,Money Speaks.,1,20 July 2014,"Transformers: Age of Extinction Review What a perverse attack on the senses, following up my personal favourite movie of the year is my least favourite movie of the year and as a matter of fact one of the worst I've ever seen. Michael Bay, you did it again, you released a trailer tailor made for the ten year old inside me and go on to develop a movie that has an uninteresting story, terrible performances, lazy effects and horrible and I mean horrible dialogue. The sad fact is I funded its inevitable sequel, but never again. Oh god the plot... Okay, compose yourself and here we go. Mark Wahlberg plays a down on his luck inventor who eventually stumbles upon an old truck which surprise, surprise happens to be the one, the only, stupidly written leader of the Autobots Optimus Prime. Obviously Wahlbergs character (Cade) being an inventor tries to patch-up the Prime so he is able to stop the genocide of his people who are being hunted by Lockdown and a secret division within the CIA. Oh and there is 'The Seed' which is essentially the AllSpark-like Mcguffin which is needed to push the plot along. Along the way there are explosions and slow-motion, yay! Also Megatron is going to be shoe-horned in somewhere because I mean why not make the same movie four times, am I right? The direction taken in this movie is no different than the other three, hitting the same beats, with the same poorly executed action, horrible dialogue and ridiculously immature and senseless humour. Oh no wait we don't have Shia LaBeouf screaming ""Optimus!"" every ten minutes. Mark Wahlberg tries his best, however it is seemingly futile with the script he is given to work with. This is the worst he has been since 'The Happening', I really do think his performance is very dependent on the script and in this case he is poor. Nicola Peltz plays the seventeen year old daughter (Tessa) of Wahlbergs character doesn't have a particularly extensive filmography, only being credited in seven movies her whole career. However for her next movie she could use her performance in this as a basis to move forward. The girl wasn't necessarily bad, she honestly didn't really have much to do other than standing, running and looking pretty which seems to be a recurring theme for women starring in a Micheal Bay movie. It is clear that Bay was once a music video director, with multiple awkward lingering shots on the young girls behind, which were cringe-inducing. Jack Reynor (Shane), the boyfriend of Peltz was probably the best part of the movie... That doesn't say much, apart from the broken Irish accent despite living in Ireland, he is okay. This is the part that upsets me the most Stanley Tucci (Joshua Joyce) and Kelsey Grammar (Harold Attinger) have already shown through previous work that they are good, if not great actors. Nonetheless they are terrible in this movie, Tucci made me chuckle once while Grammar cannot pull off the hard-face CIA operative. As for the Transformers themselves, despite the character models being somewhat impressive they do what they have been doing in all the other movies, punch things in slow motion multiple times. There are two new Autobots who we meet, with no introduction at all voiced by Ken Watanabe and John Goodman, how do actors of this calibre get roped into these movies? Oh yeah it's a money printing franchise. The setting has changed, for a portion of the movie, instead of a major American city being destroyed we get Hong Kong. Admittedly it was a nice change, but it made little to no difference. What really made me angry was the lazy visual effects for the Decepticons, the introduction of Transformium (the substance the transformers are made out of) seemed to only be there to make the actual transforming look horrible and lazy. The movie honestly didn't even have a 'tone' as such, it was just noise, colours and explosions and as for the score it wasn't exactly memorable, nothing stuck with me, it evoked no emotion whatsoever. If the intention of this movie is to appeal to children, which it may be despite the target audience being someone around my age (20) who grew up with the cartoon then why the hell does it have a run time of 165 minutes, it is protracted and doesn't have enough noteworthy content to make up for it. I completely believe the run-time contributed to my disdain for this movie, I felt like my senses were being molested, it didn't even excite the kid in me like films such as 'Pacific Rim' did last summer. Moreover it may be labelled a 'popcorn flick' or 'guilty pleasure', but there is a plethora of other great action-packed summer movies worthy of viewing instead of this. It may seem disrespectful to critique a movie in this way, but we, the audience seemingly don't deserve the respect from Mr Bay to come up with any original content for this franchise. I guess money speaks, if we keep seeming them, they'll keep making them.'Transformers: Age of Extinction'- 1/2 out of 5.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

It is predictable and boring. I don't even want to type about it for fear of falling asleep.I turned this off ~75% through the movie. Just couldn't go on. A very rare occurrence.Good things in the movie: people actually die (drama factor), main/first(?) bad Transformer isn't a psycho killing autobots for no reason, main/ maybe secondary(?) villain is not as bad as we are lead to believe, and inventor being the main character is a huge step up from a random kid.Bad things in the movie: empathy for the characters is spread way too thin, first it is the main hero, then the main hero's daughter's boyfriend, then autobots, then someone else, then secondary villain, then some other autobots, and then Prime, and yeah. I am sure the ending was amazing, except I didn't watch it to that point, can't imagine it changes anything. Good guys win. Prime decides to keep saving humans. Feel goodness.

616,guillaumepaquettej,A poor movie too long for what it has too offer (but with robots fighting),6,4 October 2014,"With this movie, I tough we were done with the racial stereotype jokes and the ridiculous characters (god I was so wrong). I gotta say Mark Wahlberg's character seemed more credible to fit in a Transformers' movie than Sam (okay, Shia was fitting well in the first movie, but he was always coming in a combo pack with the ridiculous characters that were his parents), but with Wahlberg we still have to deal with his stupid American friend, his sexy daughter that can barely act and this egocentric rich company owner (without forgetting cameos from other clichés like a big strong black woman that act all b**tchy and Asian people that of course know martial arts enough to fight against trained agents).Apart from that and the ridiculous amount of product placement (there's seriously an Oreo add on a transformer that appears in the movie for a few seconds), you can still find something to enjoy in this movie filled with useless humans characters and back stories. Firstly, Lockdown is awesome as a villain and Optimus Prime is pretty memorable too. Truly badass and mysterious, Lockdown is one of the best transformer character created in the movie and is always accompanied with his own awesome song (very well composed by Steve Jablonsky). As for Optimus, we develop a lot more of him in this movie, which ends up making him a more interesting character than most of the humans.Secondly, the cinematography, along with the soundtrack and the special effects, is amazing (of course it is to be expected considering the budget of the film, but I think it's still important to mention the awesome work done here). The whole special effect team did an awesome job at keeping Michael Bay's monster enjoyable with some action- packed sequences and awesome transformers characters that makes you feel like a 11 years old again (including the dinobots, Lockdown and his canon face and an autobot Samurai).In the end, let's just hope that if Michael Bay wants to do another of these robots blockbusters, he will eventually understands that people only watch these movies for robots fighting, and that taking out an hour of extra characters and back stories might be a good idea.6/10 because my inner 11 years old liked Lockdown (and his song), but otherwise it deserves a 5/10.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
617,Whiskeyjack98,"again Michael bay, really",1,10 November 2014,"It has been said that this entire franchise is just one big Michael Bay wet dream, this is absolutely true.A septic tank of cinematography, once again someone left the cgi equipment out for Michael Bay to get at and he's famous enough that he got away with it. Well big mistake guys, another movie with loads of special effects that get way too boring way to fast. Michael bay recreated the first 3 transformers again except this time with slightly better graphics and robot dinosaurs.This movies prime antagonist for some reason takes a backseat to some random guy for most of the movie, what? Then, again a hot female lead but this time she's 17, yes, a minor you heard right. Her 20 year old boyfriend carries around a laminated piece of law that excuses him from statutory rape, so don't worry, it's fine.Forgetting the myriad inmemeroble characters, the weird unexpected romances, the Steve jobs look alike, the ridiculous free rein given to the cia, the egregious amount of product placement, the lazy stereotypes of the new autobots and the massive deus ex machina that is the giant robot dinosaurs, this movie is poorly paced, way to long, full of plot holes, has a poor script, terrible sporadic attempts at comedy, too many Optimus prime inner monologue moments and average acting.I heard you're making another trilogy Michael, please don't.

Maybe my summary was a little harsh, as the film does offer some really good action and special effects, this is however all it really does offer. You might be saying this is just some old man's review who doesn't even know what people these day are into. I am however a teenager who is very into sci-fi movies, TV shows and video games, so I know what I'm talking about.My real problem with the movie is the length of it. it lasts around 3 hours, which is a big problem for me, as I can't sit that long without needing the toilet. this is why I missed about 3 mins of the movie when I couldn't hold on any longer. It was only half way through the movie when I had to take a toilet break, and by that time I wasn't really interested in what I was missing, even if it did happen to be a fight scene. Thankfully there was a lot of those, which is probably my favourite thing about any movie.

620,martinpopov,Not worth your time.,3,20 December 2015,"First of all, I want to focus on the positive aspects of the movie; the 3D special effects and sound design, as well as the soundtrack, are top notch. Now, let's focus on the bad aspects of the movie, which is pretty much everything else. The acting is awful, unrealistic, there are plenty of moments where the characters the actors are playing behave in a completely inappropriate manner ( such as Jack Reynor's character, in a very unnatural tone, admitting he has no problem having an intimate relationship with Wahlberg's underage daughter character, en front of said Wahlberg. And yes, this movie has pedophilia moments. And it's PG 13). The only cast that's actually good, is the voice cast. Plenty of explosions and mayhem, so much that it gets very repetitive. Camera work is okay; I hope you enjoy the lens flares Story is very inconsistent; a lot of segments, if you actually bother thinking about it, don't make sense. Also, there's plenty of scenes, especially during the introduction, that are not important; they are simply used as filler. The real meat of the film comes about halfway in. Product placement ruins this movie. Every scene that is critical to the plot or characters in any way, is made completely void by product placement. ( Imagine this: character is killed brutally. Less than two minutes after he dies, shameless Lamborghini product placement!) Overall, Michael Bay follows the same formula over and over again; he offers nothing new in this installment. He does manage to make it memorable, but not in the kind of memorable that makes you want to watch it again.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
621,kniles-28167,Makes me sad thinking about how good these movies COULD be,4,24 November 2017,"(Very minor spoilers.. I won't get into the story, but do mention a few instances or lines among the criticism.)So, I was a huge Transformers fan growing up. English isn't my mother language, but I watched Transformers without subtitles and actually learned English quite a bit before ever taking English classes in the 3rd grade, just from watching Transformers.When the first movie came around, I actually watched it several times. I absolutely loved it, seeing the Transformers and how incredibly well they had been done. Sure, the humor was there, but with Shia and the goofy family, it somewhat worked in a similar tone than whatever humor the cartoons had, yet kept the story grounded being serious enough to carry you throughout without rolling your eyes.The same can't be said about the later movies. With each iteration, I feel like the series has been pushing towards the kind of humor that Jar Jar Binks brought into the Star Wars movies. Ever since the ""twin"" autobots in Revenge of The Fallen, I've quite hated the way the transformers are depicted in general.This movie is a great example of what I mean; We do get introduced to new characters, but they are pretty much all complete humoristic caricatures of character cliché's. When the movie is having a bit more serious tone and taking itself and the story a tiny bit more seriously, it works - and reminds me why I'm even bothering to watch, but for most of the movie, it absolutely makes a joke out of itself and every character on the screen, with the exception of Optimus Prime.Even Bumblebee started off somewhat right; loyal, protective, yet having a bit more of a sense of humor. It made him different in the first movie, as he was a tiny bit more like humans, being able to crack a joke, when the rest seemed more ""alien"" and ""robot"" - not to mention serious about their task. This worked. Now all of them are depicted as jokesters and Bumblebee instead was depicted as this peevish, mischievous kid that can be provoked to act against all logic, just because someone says the car form he has taken isn't as cool as something else.I absolutely hate that.Then there's the one-liners - or whatever you'd wanna call them.. lines that are just put there to .. I don't know, bring around some supposedly powerful moment without there actually even being one.. like Nicola Peltz character suddenly asking her boyfriend ""Well are you still glad you met me?"" after doing the one heroic thing she does in the movie - and he goes ""Always""... Yet nothing in the entire movie ever suggested that he would've changed his mind or not glad about it. It served no purpose. There are several these kinds of clichés that make you roll your eyes even if you're trying to like the movie.This was actually my third attempt at watching this movie and I finally made it to the end. The idiotic humor, the forced ""heroism"" and absolutely tired cliché's that keep on repeating (overprotective father thing needs to be reminded of every 5 minutes during the entire mid part of the movie - and we all know that in the end the boyfriend is ""accepted"" for doing right. We've seen it countless times.) keeps this movie from being even OK. The CGI is again top notch and I can't even imagine how good of a movie a talented writer and director could do with this kind of production value. I'm also trying to remind myself that the humor is there for kids... but truth be told, I've seen countless Disney and pixar animation films that are way less childish and smarter about humor and the pacing, use of the humor. Here, the humor just devalues the movie and makes you not take characters or the plot seriously.I'm planning on watching the next one, Last Knight after this... I see it has got a review score even lower than this. Oh dear.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
622,elendil-32558,People have to stop driving on the Bay Hate Train,7,1 March 2018,"Admittably, the Transformers Franchise got worse with every movie since its really interesting first one. But Age of Extinction has to be seen as a reset of the universe. It got rid of most of the really cringy and annoying assets like Sam and some of the annoying perverted Transformers. It doesn't try to be very deep and interesting, the plot is simple and easy, a bit too long, yes, but at no point I got annoyed by the story. Most of the characters, especially the autobots have destinct roles, they don't have to be introduced, they're part of the team and do their job. Gelvatron has a really nice plottwist and some scenes are decently funny. The whole movie has some Logan vibes to it, of course without very deep conflict and not near as much emotion.I guess people still go into the movies and watch Transformers with some kind of expectation about a surprisingly good plot or expect that Bay suddenly changes his style from brainless explosion slaughter to something deep.

Too much on all and any level. Too many explosions, too much of a mess, too much talking, too much dialogue gone wrong, too much product placement, too many unlikeable heros. Mark Wahlberg is mediocre, to say the least, you couldn´t care less about his daughter, Tessa,and Shane. Repulsively conservative world view, too martial, Bumblebee either behaving like a teenager or an oversized bodyguard of humans he has never met before, being handled by random humans like a slave, no bonding, no character evolving, no connection, no chemistry, utter ruin. Plot holes everywhere. Shane fastening his seat belt in the middle of devastation, which takes place in China for no reason whatsoever, just to please the crowds. The legend called Optimus Prime, looking like a robot on steroids delivering the one cheesy line after another, ending the kill of Lockdown with the words ""honor to the end"" and then ""defend this family, defend...what they can be"" without providing a single reason and any answer on the reasonable question: Why?! Ratchet has practically been slaughtered, he himself, Optimus, was more than once almost taken out by these same humans and ""what they can be"", he has stated that he is done with humans and Earth but now all of a sudden, having killed Lockdown, the sky is blue again and his creators would be well advised to ""leave Earth alone, for he is coming for them"". Optimus, the leader of leaders, is bipolar or something? Why should anyone care about the Yeagers or any human whatsoever? Then the Dinobots degraded to pets chewing on highly advanced robots, which by the way can disassemble and reassemble themselves anytime on a molecular / particles-whirling-in-the-air level, but are exactly that easily stabbed, beheaded, shot at, dismembered and chewed upon by just about anything. Then the product placement which has here gone to extremes. Then random new Autobots out of nowhere, no justification, no plot involvement, just guns and random explosions all over the place. Then Galvatron or Megatron reincarnated complaining around with a high pitched voice calling to ""his brothers"" that they find him ""that Seed"" and having no share in the story whatsoever other than a few explosions and a lot of ruin ""his brothers looking for the Seeeeeeed"" cause. Then Galvatron disappearing just as easily with the words ""we will meet again, Prime"". Seriously? That is the all-powerful Megatron reincarnated? What are you? 12 years old? It is supposed to be Megatron for crying outloud. I could go on forever and it would not change a thing. This review is the exact same mess the film was.

Reading the reviews below, I have no idea how this piece of crap ever got a 6 as average rating. The only logic I can come up with is that Mr. Bay bought off IMDb or hired an army of raters to compensate. I'm not even gonna justify my rating. It is to obvious. Just read the reviews below to view my arguments. I agree with all of them.I actually believe Michael Bay should be punished for this. I'm not sure how, but at the very least this man should never be allowed to make a movie again, ever.

As for the plot its five years later since 'Dark of the moon' and all Transformers are being hunted by humans and they being aided by a bounty hunter Transformer. The pacing of the movie is great it hooks you and reels you in and keeps reeling you in and the tone is very dark and very sinister, to me this is the Empire Strikes Back of the Transformers franchise. It also has a lot of fun in it also with the text message in the lift being my favourite. It has great fight scenes once again and the inclusion of the Dinobots was icing on the cake, I felt ten years old again. There are subs plots to the movie even a five year old could understand as for haters and critics bashing well I suppose its cool to hate Michael Bay and Transformers. This movie is awesome and it kept me glued to the Cinema screen all the way through it, one of the best Tranformers movies.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

628,SeriousBuff,"Exciting, fresh. An excellent reboot.",8,28 June 2014,"Given all the not so positive reviews for this movie, along with a very poor third movie, I was expecting the worst. A mediocre movie. The movie I did watch was action packed, had a pretty good story line, and acting that could be argued, was better than the last few. The action scenes were outstanding. Galvatron (f.k.a. Megatron) was a let down but this has been the theme the previous two movies anyway. A build up of the character, and then it falls flat. It would have been great to have Josh Duhamel and Tyrese Gibson back but the rest of the previous cast needed the change. Mark Wahlberg and Stanley Tucci were spot on. Dinobots were a great add!! Looking forward to the next movie!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
629,chris-5732,Good Film but has problems,1,9 July 2014,"This is my own analysis of the Transformer films including the 3rd and this new one. Do not get me wrong, I loved the first two Transformer films, they were the right length, the character development of both humans and transformers was just right and they had humour, so when I went to the 3rd movie, I expected the same format to follow. Alas I was disappointed, because as the film drew to the final, the battle scenes and fight became longer and longer and the film dragged on. In fact it dragged on far longer than needed - with the 3rd film nearly 3 hours - 154 Min's, it needed to be shorter - say 2hrs to maybe 2hrs 30min (and only if the rest of the film supports it). However humour was lacking and do parents really want kids to sit through 3hrs? In the UK this received a 12 rating, and I really doubt 3hrs for a 12 year old or younger child with parent attending would keep their interest! This fourth film in my opinion, had other issues which need to be taken into account before developing a possible 5th movie. The initial opening was fine, it started off with the development of the characters and followed on nicely, however soon it became a mess and jumble with no actual direction of a proper plot or character development, and descended into Optimus Prime versus the attacking forces. Human character development was far and few between, humour totally lacking - in fact the audience only laughed once during the whole film. CGI and special effects were outstanding, and the 3D here was used brilliantly, but even that could not save this film. It would have been a far better movie at say 2hrs rather than 165 Min's which is listed as its total running time. It is a shame as the film itself has some good underlying features and parts, alas hardly any appearance of Bumblebee and the new ones that were featured were not developed character wise and you never really got to explore them or care about them. Please Michael Bay, make the next movie more on the original characters, better humour and not as long!",Transformers - Age of Extinction

The robots are moving and interacting as if they are real metal people . The way they move , talk , react its like your seeing real living characters .

Otherwise this is a pile of garbage that is needlessly extended to a torturous 2.5 hrs. The story and screenplay surely is written by a retarded 9 year old and not to mention the direction stinks far worse than the bad cheese that is laden in every frame of this film. Avoid it, avoid it, avoid it, at all costs. We cannot further support film makers like these. How could they invest a ton of money in this film? Have we been reduced to such pathetic levels? I remember the action films of the 90s, when I was a kid. They were far better, although they didn't age very well. Michael Bay can never be trusted - period. With the revision of the cast, and all the criticism faced by the previous instalments I had an inkling of a feeling that Mr.Bay would worked out some sense into this one. But boy was I wrong!! This is just as loud, cheesy, mind numbingly boring and worthless, shameful film making yet again. I'd rather watch Adam Sandler's Jack and Jill in reverse 50 times.

In previous transformers movies I was bored with the CG action, finding myself watching close up's of Optimus Primes arm moving rapidly across the screen, presumably doing something cool but I never knew for sure. In Age of Extinction we get to see it all. The Transformers are beautifully rendered, detailed and lively in their action scenes. I generally liked the design of the transformers though John Goodman's Hound transformer was too anthropomorphic for my tastes.Unfortunately the non-CG aspects of the movie weren't quite as good. Generic, expositive dialogue and one dimensional characters were commonplace. Marky mark played a character whom we have all seen him play before. The other actors were present and didn't really add anything to their roles.Overall the best I can say for this movie is that I don't regret having spent 2 hours and 45 minutes giving this movie 60% attention.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Senseless plot with countless holes, stupid dialogs and the worst: robots that act and talk like some gangs you might see in the streets.

637,andrewelliott777,The cinematic equivalent of eating fast food for three hours,6,29 June 2014,"Let me start with the good points. This movie looks amazing and you can see where the 165,000,000 dollars went (not to feed the hungry or educate the poor, but I digress). The intricate design of the machines and the enchanting backdrops are visually stunning. It was fun to look at. What I found irritating was the pacing and the editing. A good movie has ups and downs, rising tension, climaxes, unexpected twists, and some kind of emotional involvement with the characters. This movie came out of the gate at full speed and never stopped for three hours. I couldn't keep up. It was exhausting and mind-numbing. I actually came out of the film feeling dumber somehow. The dialogue was one cliché after another and felt totally unnatural. The main character was kind of a jerk. There is also a blatant bud light commercial midway through. Oh yes, and of course the bad guy is motivated by love of God and country, and other thinly veiled partisan left wing clichés. Also,whenever the Transformers made some kind of heroic pronouncement I was reminded that this whole franchise is based on toys for small children, but then an 'F' bomb would be dropped or the camera would pan up a scantily clad hottie, and I would wonder who this movie was exactly aimed at.

Courage against impossible odds, sacrificing ones self for others , plunging in a seemingly impossible to win battle to save a friend. This I saw and felt despite Mr. Bay's best efforts to make me sleep I was there at the end and I savored it.Finally Optimus Prime is the hero. The main man. He is The One as he should be. But he can't go it alone. He needs help from robots and humans alike.

On the human & transformer side, shouldn't the trust between human & autobot be easily re-established? Perhaps you can argue that this is autobot but not human :p When the movie scene is about Hong Kong, I have difficulty to agree or appreciate with idea that China is next HK ISLAND! Perhaps I am too realistic. I would think this film is calculated for China market as there are too many elements of China. For example, most of the drink which are Chinese product, or a supporting character is the current HK boxing champion. I can understand business is business, but those elements are simply too much.

644,Pittsburgh87,Do Not listen to Critics or Negative reviews,10,7 July 2014,"Critics have no idea how to review Transformers movies and neither do most people. For some reason Transformers movies get the most criticism compared to other movies based off of some childhood cartoon or comic.I get it, most people hate Michael Bay so immediately they already give these movies no shot at all. I do not care what anyone says, Bay does action very well and I can look past any cliché parts which seem to be much less compared to previous installments. People complain all he does is make big explosions and CGI but that is what most people want. Then you have these old critics who know nothing about Transformers nor did they ever watch the cartoon to understand the nostalgia of it or understand what a transformer fan REALLY wants.Would I prefer having no human characters or minimal human involvement? Sure. But I also know if it was all just transformers, there would not be as many people going to see it even if that would make fans happy.In THIS one, the human characters are a bit cliché yes, but Wahlberg and the cast are much less annoying than previous ones. The story focuses MORE on the transformers and I find myself not being as annoyed as I was in other transformers movies with pointless nonsense at some points. I also found the girl Nicola Peltz to be much less annoying that previous women as well which is a good thing.As far as the story goes, it is easy to follow and it makes sense. I have no idea why people complain so much about the plot. If this were REALLY happening, we would definitely have people out there trying to make transformers to create an army. We know obviously it is a bit unrealistic and obvious that it would cause issues but these movies never will have some complex plot to them nor should they. I think people expect some dark or serious deep plot which makes no sense considering this was a cartoon for KIDS that really didn't have much of a plot to begin with. If you watched previous movies you would have to see that besides some parts in the beginning stages, there are not that many moments with the main characters that are annoying. There is still some cliché or stupid humor but honestly most of it is fun. Some people hate it but I can tolerate pretty much all of it in this one.If you like Tranformers and want to see a lot of awesome CGI with limited human bs then this is your movie. I cannot believe the reviews coming in are so bad considering I feel this is either tied for the best one or it is the best. It is definitely better than the last 2. But because of previous failures in the other movies, this one never had a chance review wise. Don't listen to critics or negative reviews because they are nonsense. Everything they complain about is pretty much what everyone like me asks for: lots of transformers action. Critics seem to complain and just say oh its more metal robot CGI blah blah but that is what people WANT to see. There is not much else they can REALLY do with this franchise besides make up these simple plots to see these battles. Even if they eliminated all the humans and made it transformers only, critics would hate it more saying it has no soul and it is mindless CGI. There is really no winning with critics on these movies. Everyone I know who wanted to see this one agrees its one of the best. People need to relax and enjoy a popcorn action flick like this. You know what you are getting into and if you don't like it, well then these movies are just not for you.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

646,denis_barbov,"Transformers is back better, bigger and fresher. (Saw it in DOLBY ATMOS)",9,28 June 2014,"The new installment of the franchise is back fresher, better and bigger. This is the first movie shot with the newest IMAX cameras, save for ""Interstellar"". It is filled with more CGI and explosions but that is not necessarily a bad thing. The new cast is good as they brought some emotions into the movie.The plot isn't something unseen or unheard of. On the one hand we have Mark Wahlberg is portraying a very protective father called Cade Yeager, who tries to invent and repair things in order to earn a living. His daughter Tessa(Nicola Peltz)is trying to go to college. Jack Reynor embodies a character named Shane Dyson - Tessa's secret boyfriend. There is also Lucas a kind of friend and employee of Cade.On the other hand Joshua Joyce(Stanley Tucci) is presented to us as the scientist, who claims to have found a new element of the Periodic table he names ""Transformium"". There is also Darcy Tirrel (Sophia Myles) - the sort of assistant of Joshua. There is also a member of the Secret Services who helps them(or at least we are let to believe so) called Harold. And the Transformers are, of course, here.The movie starts off with Cade finding a truck and then being attacked by the government because of it. It chases him because the truck is, in fact, Optimus Prime. After a series of events Shane meets Tessa's father under bad circumstances. In the end they team up for the sake of saving Tessa. There was some humor in this film and wasn't as dry as it used to be before. So I am happy for that.The first hour and something of the film takes place in Texas and Chicago. Afterwards it moves to Beijing and Hong Kong. Speaking of hours, the film's length is around the two and a half hour mark. The official running time is 165 minutes but they include the ten- minute credits. It didn't feel as long to me as I've heard from others. I will lie if I say that it isn't dragged at some scenes but that's not too noticeable.Regardless of what people say about Michael Bay's direction I liked it. Quite a lot, in fact. Yes, there were quite a few lens flares and an enormous amount of explosions but that's just his approach. And I am not ashamed to say I liked it. Speaking of direction I simply cannot not mention the special and visual effects, which were astonishing. I did find Prime looking differently in this installment. He was looking better. Same goes for all the autobots.The sound was incredible. At least to me. I saw it in DOLBY ATMOS and I was just blow away or dare I say magnetised upwards. The sounding was fascinating. There was a certain scene were objects were magnetically dragged upwards and the sound just kind of... shivered me. I could feel so many vibrations and it was just incredible experience. Mentioning sound, the soundtrack is really well-done. ""Imagine dragons did their job rally well. The music was a perfect fit for the scenes.Speaking of autobots, Prime and his fellows are not welcome on Earth anymore. At least not by the government because they are now considered dangerous. We are introduced to the new, ""improved"" versions of the transformers. They have been artificially created by the humans from the remains of the killed decepticons. They transform in a different way and are more durable. They are harder to kill/destroy. And lets face it, you want to know about the dinobots. Yes, they do transform but I can't say anything else without giving too much away. Just a hint - they do not transform into cars. The dinobots were on the screen around the last 40-60 minutes. And last but not least, the acting was definitely better. I liked Mark's expression and everything. Tessa overacting sometimes but, oh well, which blond in Bay's film doesn't? Shane's actor was really good at showing emotions too. All in short, Transformers: Age of Extinction is overall the best installment in the quadrilogy and frankly, one of Bay's best films. Of course, it has its flaws like not really clear plot but it was very entertaining movie with a few moments that leave you on the edge of your seat.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

I thought that this was gonna b the same usual transformers setup but this one has a better story line than the last two, don't get me wrong I enjoyed the other two and I own them all on DVD but I really enjoyed this one. The plot is better thought out and it makes more sense as it shows how the transformers were made in the beginning, not just some vague idea that they are from out of space, they are metal they had to come from somewhere someone had to make them.The actors are better, I know who most if them are and I love watching mark wahlberg kick some butt. The film is better set up and it's the same main transformers and I love the fact they have used good and well acclaimed actors in this film, not like the first three with little known TV stars as the main characters.As for the 'eye candy' that many of the other write ups for this film have mentioned (I'm talking about the write ups I've read in the papers), yes there is some nice looking cast members but they can act unlike a certain female cast member from the first two who can not act for the life of her, all the films she has been in are awful apart from the transformers films, but the rest of the cast more than made up for that.I'm looking forward to the next one I'm hoping that there are going to be some more questions answered",Transformers - Age of Extinction

However, that was probably the perfect sign that the movie had gone on too long. I stopped caring about what was happening and tried picking out places I had been recently.

653,bellis90,"Close,but no cigar.",2,2 August 2014,"*Spoilers abound*I've been waiting for this for a while and I was glad I finally saw it. however as someone who actually liked the first movie and Dark Of The Moon (let's not get started on what I thought of the travesty that was Revenge Of The Fallen), I felt it was majorly lacking in a sense of plot while the visuals are hands down the best in the series (especially in 3D). but all the visuals in the world can't help the fact that the script is a major jumbled mess. Mark Wahlberg plays Cade Yeager, a failed scientist who finds Optimus Prime hiding out in an old movie theater and repairs him. meanwhile a scientist (Stanley Tucci) is working on mastering the metal of the transformers called Transformium (not even kidding about that) so he can build a transformer army of his own who apparently is working with a cia agent(Kelsey Grammar)who wants to destroy all Transformers but are working together with a mega transformer who is a bounty hunter looking for optimus prime, but is willing to let the humans do it in exchange for a space seed...which Stanley Tucci wants because apparently the mind of Megatron tells him so, so Megatron (now re-branded as Galvatron) can destroy humanity.If that synopsis made sense to you, It's because I've deciphered it the best I could. there are plot holes abound leaving a very non-sensical plot that left me scratching my head more than a David Lynch film...and this is for a Transformers film. (for instance, it's never explained how the humans know to contact the bounty hunter who just happens to have what they want...or the fact that they were lucky enough to find said bounty hunter and not be killed in the first place.)There are also huge gaps in editing where Optimus Prime will be driving not that far away from mark wahlberg. we'll see him several minutes later on top of a roof beating up some decepticon without a clue as to how he got there. Maybe you could have cut the numerous scenes of the boyfriend being smug towards Mark Wahlberg or the numerous lectures of how humanity has changed and Optimus Prime not caring about humanity anymore to fit in that little bit. or maybe you could have cut the revealtion that the CIA killed Ratchet TWICE! (no seriously, Cade hooks up some weird surveillance drone to his car and is able to project what the drone has seen. you see Ratchet's death and Optimus doesn't bat a freaking eye. Later you see Ratchet being melted down for Transformium and Optimus goes ""they killed Ratchet"" and then freaks out and rampages into a factory)...but this was overkill. running at 2 Hours and 45 minutes, you start to lose patience quick especially when it adds up to nothing but a 3 hour TV pilot as the movie is left deliberately open for a sequel. hopefully, the 5th movie has a better written script",Transformers - Age of Extinction

The acting was great and action and the 3d effects where brilliant the plot carried on from the previous 3 and they done it well it kept me glued to my seat all the way through. So if you like action pack great 3d effects and fit girls don't listen to those bad reviews go and see it.Best film i have seen this year apart from Godzilla cant wait for the next hopefully bay does the next because he has done all of them well and hopefully we wont have to wait so long next time.Thats all i have got to say about this i am just filling to the minimum line,Transformers - Age of Extinction

Michael Bay cares very little about the actual Transformers stories, or it's fans. Be prepared for a movie full of new Transformers with little or no explanation of who they are or where they came from. They are really just there to fill the screen. Be ready for more racist Transformers that make absolutely no sense. If you are going back for the 4th installment because it has DinoBots, then they have won. DinoBots the ""new"" Dinosaur robots make their appearance at the end of the movie and do almost nothing. There are plenty of explosions and pointless violence. They tried so hard to add humor, but all the jokes fell very flat. You will find yourself caring very little for any of the characters, human or robot. They also tried to make this an origin story then gave up and figured they would wait for the sequel to do a real origin story. The worst part of everything is the trailer makes this movie to be AutoBots protecting humans from an alien invasion, this movie is none of that.

657,Gigyflib,Action Packed but the Story is C**p,5,18 July 2014,"This film is not great. No one expected it to be. The story is beyond understandable and makes little to no sense. Too quickly will you be taken from the lovely quiet lives of the human protagonists into the mad action, explosion filled carnage. As a result you will not get connected to the new characters.However, these characters are bland and boring. They try to touch your heart in a sort of weak pathetic way. They are in no way characters you will want to see again but chances are we will.In terms of the Transformers themselves, as is common most of the Transformers cast short of Optimus and Bumblebee have bee replaced with rather bland new ones. Even one of the poster boy Transformers, the dinobot Grimlock, doesn't turn up until the last 15-20 minutes.In short, its an action filled explosion fest typical of the series but though it tries to put itself forward for a 5th, no one will be to excited for the franchises future",Transformers - Age of Extinction

In the beginning of the beginning I was perplexed but the longer I watched movie the more I was sure that this sentence was the most exiting and interesting scene within whole movie and gives short summary of latest trash prepared by Mr. Bay. Mercy! Director and script writers thinks that fans of Transformers are idiots with no brain at all. Unclear story with mixed characters and message taken from Tom and Jerry ""Hey stupid cat you will never ever catch the mouse"". I don't care about amount of money spent on special effects if there is no story to tell and the movie is all about telling the story. This movie is a complete trash and full of nonsense. People wait for DVD or Netflix if you have to. I can only suggest one thing: Buy a beer don't feed Mr. Bay pocket, this movie is crap. I hope he do not even recover costs of production.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
659,duff-billy,Mind numbing,4,12 July 2014,"Even in full acknowledgment of what it was going to be like, viewing this movie felt like sitting with my head jammed in a freezer with fireworks, a very poor plot, no character development, poor punchlines, a shockingly low representation of women, and a film score that quite literally contained four repeating base notes (E, F, E and D) throughout the fifteen minutes that wasn't dominated with explosions... for three hours. Great special effects, no doubt. Lots of well-composed shots and such. But considering the movie was full of them, there wasn't really much ingenuity or variety that kept them interesting. The result was that the cornerstone - no, the foundation - of the movie felt lacking and repetitive. I did not care for the characters either, and who could? They were cardboard cutouts that never developed. And lets be honest, there was a grand total of 15 minutes that they actually COULD have, but they were dominated with our good friends E, F, E, D and some generic archetypes that were somehow supposed to replicate the experience. I wish I could be more in depth. But I just don't have too many words for this movie. If you are looking for a lot of fighting and special effects, this is your movie, but you will probably become very bored during the plot-less 3 hours that you must sit through.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

I will simply try to forget this one exists.Odd to say that it lacked realism but it did. Of course it's a fantasy movie but all movie was a bunch of explosions and forced humour with characters that were tough to bond with.The new transformers were just silly.

This is a film that deserves credit for being epic and teaches us the moral values of life. respect, Honor, loyalty, courage and gratitude.

At a running time of almost 3 hours, I knew going in it was going to be long but I had no idea it was going to be a long movie that made no sense. As a fan of all the Transformer Movies, I left feeling like they owed me money.Mark Wahlberg was 2nd fiddle to the every evolving Autobots and Decepticons in this one. Shia isn't an action star so that casting worked, Mark though not so much.The acting was bland at best. The cheesy one liners were horribly written and executed. Just a mess. I laughed a few times, but that was it.I found myself hoping it would be over any moment. Knowing the running time I kept hoping for a power failure or for the movie reel to break or even an FBI Raid on the theater we were in....but no such luck.Horrible movie. Horrible acting. Just bad all the way around. Don't waste your time or your money.

663,lileon-bierman-627-677120,Worst Transformers movie in the franchise.,2,17 September 2017,"I am a huge Transformers fan and absolutely loved the first three movies. After the first one my brother and I even followed on with some of the old TV series Transformers from DVDs we had bought and later on Transformers Prime.With the first three movies there was consistency with actors, characters and story-lines. You could make clear connections from one movie to the other and you could understand the plot. The Autobots were badass and you recognized them by their personalities, and by the vehicles they transformed into. Human interaction wasn't weird and it seemed that both robots and human beings had a mutual respect for each other.Age of Extinction completely destroyed the Transformers franchise in my opinion. I can't remember if I first saw it in cinemas on my birthday or later on, but I can definitely remember not being impressed with it. I couldn't make the connection between the last movie and Age of Extinction and couldn't understand who the new 'bad-guy' was what his story was, where he came from, nothing. There wasn't really any substance as to why all the Autobots were being killed off either. The new actors tried their best but I must admit that I couldn't find connection with them either because they weren't the ones I grew up watching. The movie lacked charisma and to be honest the Dinobots weren't all that impressive either. For such an addition that is so important, their revelation was poorly done and the amount of time they were actually seen was very little. Throughout the entire movie, I didn't know who any of the other Autobots were except Optimus, Bee, Leadfoot, Brains and Ratchet. Overall I did not understand the plot of the movie. Full-stop. There was nothing that pulled at my heart- strings or that would leave a lasting impression. I'm a pretty big Michael Bay movie fan, but I feel that he lost the plot with this movie completely and literally. His movies are great if they're done right... This one wasn't. The only reason I gave this movie an extra star is because CGI and SFX were pretty good. You can always see improvement when it comes to movies that contain loads of CGI and SFX.As for the next movie that's coming out (The Last Knight), I don't see how it would be any better; but I might be wrong. The trailers make it look alright, but that's as far as I'm going with that. In fact I am not fascinated or impressed at all about Optimus becoming a Decepticon -if that's even the correct terminology still used. The only reason I'm going to make a note of watching it is because Anthony Hopkins is in it and he's one of my favourite actors.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

At least those films know what they are trying to be. What does Michael Bay think we want to see as movie goers? This man really doesn't understand ""cool"". He seems to have it hopelessly confused with ""cheese"" and what on earth was Mark Walberg doing in this movie? They must have paid him an amount of money he simply couldn't say NO to.

I walked in expecting that it was going to suck due to all these reviews, and I understand we're all titled to our own opinion, but hey, I loved it. I walked out and felt satisfied with another Transformer blockbuster of the summer minus two minor things, but I understood one was needed for the plot line and the other thing about a name change does happen to that particular character.

The daughter and her boyfriend was so annoying I at least was hoping he would die. They don't explain what happen to the humans who helped in the last years or what lead up the the auto bots hiding. It's a slap in the face that Optimus prime a bumblebee were the only ones from the last transformers in the movie. And did Optimus always get his butt kick in the old days? That was sad to watch. It is a long movie so it you have kids or work try to see it early. After previews it started at 438 didn't get out till 715. And on a creepy note. Why did Michael Bay think that explaining how a loop hole can get you past statuary rape was appalling. He could've and should have left that out of the script.,Transformers - Age of Extinction
668,brentbandhan,"Eye candy, BUT terrible story!",6,29 June 2014,"I'll start off by saying I was a fan of the last 3 movies. I knew coming into this Michael Bay is more into explosions, special effects, etc. than a coherent plot. Plot 2/10 The idea in mind behind the plot was great, but the execution was HORRIBLE. Without giving anything away, there were plot holes all over the place. As the movie progressed, I had more questions than answers. I'm not sure where AOE was trying to go. Hopefully when I watch it again when it comes out on blu-ray, questions will be answered. Special Effects 10/10 Summer blockbuster. Transformers. Explosions. I'm pretty sure everyone goes to see this just for the special effects, so you won't be disappointed. I get headaches with IMAX 3D, but my theater also had the movie in IMAX without the 3D. I recommend seeing it RPX or IMAX. Go big or go home. The audio for the movie in IMAX/RPX is amazing as well. Verdict 6/10 See this for the special effects as with all the other transformers movies. Its worth the price to see it in IMAX/RPX. Don't expect great character depth or a coherent plot.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
669,CruaverVoidDrake,Just another transformers Movie.,1,13 October 2014,"Not sure if this is much of a spoiler or it is just confirmation of what was already bad. This is just another transformers movie, with bad jokes, bad humor, racism, stereotypicalism (that means they use stereotypes to much). I was promised dinobots in the movie and didn't get them till the very end. The only redeeming quality I could see was that there was an autobot that could fly (for once other then Optimus Prime). Also there's a scientist thinking that one cyberforming location is enough to prove that all dinosaurs did not die from an asteroid. Wow, one instance of dinosaurs found turned into metal, why do you need more evidence to rethink your dinosaur death theory? So moving on, megatron comes back from the dead, again.

It reminded me that these movies really are special, I mean how often do you get to see robotic cars brawl against each other. I remember hating the first transformers but the second and third ones were enjoyable. Finally they got rid of that horrid cast from the previous films and went with mark wahlberg as the leading role. At first I wasn't sure how that'd work out but it was a solid performance by him and he is joined by the lovely nicola peltz who plays his daughter who also did very well.This transformers takes place a few years down the road from the third movie and is basically about a transformers apocalypse.

673,alicool48,Transformers 4: Age Of Extinction,3,2 December 2014,"I can not tell you how exited i was for Transformers Age Of Extinction. I mean after 3 movies who feel exactly the same i really wished this movie was going to be awesome. Shia was gone, Megan was gone, Rosie was gone, Sams parents (Thank god) are gone, John Turturro is gone, and they replaced Shia with Mark Walhberg which is one of my favorite actors of all time. So after 3 movies i was tired of Shia and i really really! wished that this movie was going to be the Transformers movie we all wanted. New cast, New story, New cool allies, New cool villains, because i really wasn't a fan of the trilogy i liked the first one, The second one is one of the worst movies i have ever seen, The third one wasn't really that much better then the second but it was bad. And after Transformers Age Of Extinction being one of my most anticipated movies of 2014 this movie was terrible and a huge disappointment. I was going in to this movie not giving a caring about the old Transformers this movie was exactly the same as the others. The only thing i liked about this movie is Mark Wahlberg, OK. He wasn't perfect. He Had some problems, But at least he did something he actually grabbed a gun and helped the Autobots in battle he just wasn't running around screaming BUMBLEBEE!! OPTIMUS!! He actually did stuff and that was a good thing. But he could not help that this movie really is terrible. This is exactly the same movie as we have seen 3 times, Exactly the same FOR A 4 TIME! uh. Nicole Peltz really wasn't terrible in this movie but she was so freaking annoying. But hold on there is her boyfriend Shane. Waoow! These 2 together were so freaking annoying (Still not worse then Sams parents) but they just didn't do anything he was just there because she was there thats it, TJ Miller in this movie was awful, Why? because it's Michael Bays humor. He just runs around saying really annoying stuff and you are just sitting there wanting to slap him in the face. I like TJ Miller! and Stanley Tucci in this movie was OK, He was good the first time we saw him but as the movie kept going and going he got more and more annoying and in the end he was just terrible.But the worst part is that you can see Michael Bay is trying to turn him in to John Turturros character from the last 3 movies. And this movie is way to long. This movie is almost 3 hours long. It dozen't need to bee that long. The scenes just keeps going and going and never end and you really just want the movie to move to the next scene, just please move on! I mean this movie could have ended 45 minutes to early and i still would not change anything. Optimus Prime & Bumblebee are the only ones that are back from the old movies. But exactly as the other Transformers movies Optimus Prime and Lockdown (He wasn't in the old movies but I'm counting him as Megatron because he was the only one who had a character development out of the Transformers) are the only Transformers that has any Character Devalopment. I saw the cartoon as a kid so i know which Transformers is who. The New Autobots are Crosshairs, Drift, and Hound. But for the people who has not seen the cartoon they just know them as. The green one, The samurai one, and the fat one. Once again The Transformers has absolutely no Character development because of the lazy Michael Bay. They are way way Way to many villains in this movie, You don't know who is the main villain. Is it Kelsey Grammar? Lockdown? Galvatron? Stanley Tucci? Titus Welliver? I don't know. As a said This movie just keeps going and going and won't stop, Characters you are suppose to care about but in the end you don't care, Lazy directing, Pase problems, No Character development for both the humans and the Transformers, To many villains, Waaay to long, Ohh how could i forget, The reason why most people went to see this movie, The Dinobots. They are barely in it, They are in the end for probably 15 minutes max, in a movie who is 2 Hours and 45 minutes. This movie is exactly the same as the other movies. Some Action scene at the beginning, You see the humans they are having a problem with something, There is something secret about the government, We see the Autobots and the humans meeting, Something happens, There is a little action scene so the people want get bored halfway trough the movie, and the last 30-40 minutes is nothing but explosions and robot-fights, the only difference here was that there wasn't something with the military. In the end of this movie i was surprised of how bored i got watching things explode and robots fighting. Seriously, The final battle is so freaking boring!! Probalby cause iv'e seen it a thousand times before in the other movies who is 2 hours and 30 minutes long. This movie mad me sad, Bored so hard, Disappointed. I will now never look forward to a Transformers movie as long as Michael Bay is directing it. This movie disappointed me really big and just was a peace of failure 3/10 Terrible Movie!!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
674,riverwall217,Superb! Much more interesting!,10,4 July 2014,"What's wrong with the hater reviews from others? This movie has everything in such a great combo! Superb effects, nice cars, good looking & talented dudes, great story line. I don't think that storyline is too fast or incoherent according to some people. Perhaps people find it too fast or incoherent because they scrutinize on the details of everything in the movie! THAT IS WHY MOST PEOPLE COULD NEVER ENJOY THE MOVIE AND GAVE THE BAD RATING! You should just watch the movie as it flows, without having to pay attention on every insignificant detail. Some conversations or jokes are not so great, but it can be improved for next sequel, not a big deal. It has some slow-paced scenes in between action-fueled packs so the plot is balanced out. The Autobots are always as inspiring as its storyline. Can you people notice how hard the casts had worked to do some of the scenes? This movie is perfect in every way, there is basically nothing for audience to pick fault at. And I am glad that Michael Bay finally replaced LaBeouf with a more talented guy Wahlberg (Sorry LaBeouf). I suggest movie goers to enjoy it as it flows and make yourself FEEL as if you are in it to enjoy the movie better, especially for people who find it hard to follow.

I loved the first 2 films, and thought the 3rd was just about entertaining enough to pass as a mediocre film. This is very much in the same vein as the 3rd film... only not as good.Straight off the bat, I HATED the cast, and i hated the script even more. I quite like Mark Whalberg, but he definitely doesn't suit the main character/family man in this film, he'd have been better off with a military role. The script is horrible. Everything about it is just painful. The things said are stupid, it doesn't flow, it seems forced and hardly a single conversation feels like an actual conversation. Also they have gone OVER THE TOP on the comedy. The beauty of comedy in these films, and other super hero films alike, is the infrequent comedy scenes, that choose their moments. In this film it is just gag after gag in completely inappropriate situations.If you get that out the way.... there are some positives...... not many though.The special effects as you can imagine, are incredible. Its so over the top and stupid, you can't help but sit back and just think 'wow.... how much did this cost?'. The inclusion of the Dinobots was a nice little feature, although they were given hardly any screen time. Same goes for Bumblebee, he's hardly in the last hour and a half of the film. The entire Autobot race is downright annoying in this film too, with the exception of Bumblebee and Hound. Optimus and the others are just annoying. There voices, what they say and how they say it.As another reviewer here said, Its a bit like a musician releasing the same album over and over again, except playing it slightly louder each time....... Perfect analogy for this series I feel.Overall, A huge disappointment, but some entertaining bits.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

680,knzy96,I like it. Awesome fun and great action.,8,24 December 2014,"Okay people, here goes. Most of you are going to hate me, and a few of you are going to love me. I LIKE THE TRANSFORMERS MOVIES. I think that they are great action movies that are unique. Yeah I know! Crazy! I bet your mind is already blown by the fact I actually like these movies.I enjoyed this movie for a lot of reasons. The first reason I liked this movie, is because it is has lots of breath taking visual effects. Everything looks real, from the scratches on the face of Optimus Prime, to the debris falling from dying AutoBots. The visuals were fantastic. People are always quick to dog on Michael Bay for lots of explosions, and apparently, ""no story, just explosions for 3 hours,"" but this is not the case. There is a story, and the story is there, you just have to pay attention to the show. The mistake that people made with this franchise was going into ready to nit pick the bad parts of it. If they just look past the explosions, they would fall in love with the auto-bots. Mark Wahlberg did a fantastic job playing an over protective young father. He did a great job playing a static role. You will see the character development he has throughout the movie. I thought he did a great job with this film and I would love to see him do another movie.No Shia Leboueff. YES! For the first time in the whole series, you don't have to have your ear drums busted from Shia yelling ""BUMBLE BEE!!!!"" They did a good job opening up a window for other movies to be made with the ending of the movie. I will not say the end here, but I will say keep note of that as you watch. These movies are good movies and I really wish that people wouldn't be so quick to dog on the movies just because Michael Bay directs them. I don't care what argument you try to give me, or what reason you try to cook up, you don't have the movie, you just hate Michael Bay. This is why people go and see movies like Avatar. It is the reason that movie made almost 3 billion dollars. Critics LOVE James Cameron, as well as the public, and it doesn't matter what his movies have in it, they will find a way to love it. So my advice to you is to watch this movie and pretend that Michael Bay didn't direct it.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

But this is 2h and 45 min of absolute rubbish, jammed packed with slow motion clips that adds nothing, random muting and adding random awful music tracks, the story line is virtually nonexistent and where it tries to add some it's completely incoherent.I'm appalled that I forced my self to sit through the whole film just in case it shaped up, which it didn't.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
683,fireflyic3,"A long, thrilling and visually spectacular work of art.",7,6 July 2014,"First off I'll say that I went into the theatre with super low expectations. After reading all of the negative reviews, and judging from Michael Bay's history, I went to watch it because I believed that the cast was too good to be portrayed poorly. And I think I was right. Mark Wahlberg is phenomenal, and while the first transformers movies display cheesy and uninteresting family screen time, this movie cleverly mixes captivating characters and family struggles with transformer-oriented plot (and not some boring tale of a teen that was no-ones favourite character. *hint *hint Witwicky).As for the length, which seemed like the haters' main hating point, 2:40 minutes is fine! Better to lengthen the movie to fit everything in than shorten it and have gaping plot holes. Also, movies were originally that long. Back in the 60s, classics like ""My Fair Lady"" or ""Hello Dolly,"" and pretty much every other movie of that time were all super long. So I don't see why it should be considered as a sin. Personally, I like long movies, so I didn't mind it, and I felt there was enough action to carry it smoothly to the end.Speaking of which, the action was spectacular. Supported with the best special effects so far in the series, and superb sound editing and mixing, Age of Extinction's action scenes define themselves as the movie's main selling points. Though I will agree that some of the action scenes seemed to blur together. That's the only big reason for lowering my rating, though. Everything else is phenomenal.So, If you're a transformers fan, you'll love this movie. If you're not, it's all up to what you're expecting that will determine how you feel about it. I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, but if you like raw epic action, fantastic acting to support it, and Michael Bay humour, Transformers: Age of Extinction is a must see. After you watch the other ones, of course.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

You'll see what I mean even better that way. The way the movies are constructed in terms of storyboard with intros, washed up actresses that would otherwise be very unattractive, terrible CG with shallow plots & corny screenplay - it is all practically the same for a movie series that will continue to sell to the masses of the ignorant movie goers.

685,zack-dixon,Great Special Effects...too much product placement,5,16 July 2014,"I am a big Transformers fan and thought that this new movie with Mark Wahlberg would have some redeeming qualities...it did not, but that being said it was refreshing to see a new face. The best parts of the film were the CGI animation of the Transformers themselves as seen consistently throughout the series the action sequences are spectacular and well detailed and the sword gun (?) that Mark uses was pretty bad ass. That's where the good parts end.What the most standout worst part of the film was the ridiculous amount of product placement I have ever seen. Items ranging from Beat's speakers to Bud Light beer were literally shoved down your throats. Trucks driving around in the background with various companies advertising their products and even one of the Transformers had Lamborghini patches on his chest it was out of control. I understand companies do this and to a degree I don't have a problem with it when it is used to a common degree of sense but this over the top advertisement made the movie feel cheap and tacky I'm pretty sure the audience noticed this as they laughed of groaned in agony whenever another ""add"" presented its head at the sheer annoyance it brought. As for the story it was pretty predictable, good guys come, bad guys come and good guys kill bad guys, nothing new or surprising, I have given up this aspect since the third film and usually watch for the CGI and to a degree even some of it was pretty average. The new deceptacons transform like cubes which were pretty average looking for the series it really stood out unlike the original transformers that were more visually spectacular to watch. Overall I was not disappointed by the movie...you have to have expectations to do that. Thought he CGI for the most part was spectacular the over the top product placement and boarder line story left makes that movie feel tacky.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
686,vladberez,Its a bit upside-down,3,27 June 2014,"I cannot say that I didn't enjoy the movie, because really I did. But it wasn't a new summer blockbuster hit as we were promised. Instead, it was the same stuff shoved in our faces yet again. One more the plot revolves around a piece of alien weaponry, once more our planet is n mortal danger, once more are the people and aliens required to fight side by side, once more (and for the third time) guess who comes back. Again were given city-wide battle, and recycled comedic anti-hero (who just like the other one switches sides). one more time we are shown humans, needing to defend the alien technology, and a hot chick because ""Transformers"" can't exist without one. The list goes on and on. It's as if the original trilogy was put into a blender and only the script remains different.Being said, the movie is an action flick. You can only take those in a few new directions. with the action sequences it would have been forgiven...but. They really screwed up human character development, and the human characters in general. The main characters daughter, who tags along thought the whole film does just that:tags along. The movie would have gone on the same if she were never even mentioned. Her boyfriend, who does some fancy driving...does only fancy driving. He even had a chance to do something in one particular scene but his character actually chickens out, making him actually worthless. The main character himself though has some interesting skills. 45 minutes into the show, the barnyard inventor know how to ""Mission Impossible"" his way into a super government building. he somehow also knows how to flawlessly fire an alien weapon ad hit his target every single time. The human characters seem flat and one sided, simply there to push the plot forward.Although iv'e been banging on the faults of this film, there really are some good quality's to it. Even though they don't redeem the film, they do tip the scale.The human characters and everything about them seemed kind of half- assed. That being said, the progress of the transformers and Optimus Prime especially is what really keeps it going. Through the entire original trilogy he has defended the human race no matter what, even when we wanted him and his autobots out. Now that the humans have changed their look on the transformers, now that they claim they ""don't need them"", the humans hunt them for their knowledge and scrap. After willing to die for the humans Optimus Prime has changed. On several occasions the calm personality we knew before, is easily enraged and is willing to break his vow of never killing a human. The autobots see themselves as underdogs, fighting for a cause were they aren't welcome. This...is were the film shines, new sides of characters we least expected it from. But isn't that the wrong way round, when the robots have more emotion than the humans?Along with that, you cant deny that the film is a Christian bale major motion picture. And with that come flawless, bad-ass, epic, and massive action. Witch succeeds in making you feel like a transformer when you step out of the theater.After the dust has cleared, I would recommend seeing it. But I would also tell her to lower your expectations. Along with a generally good movie experience the movie leaves you with a great cliff-hanger, leaving several possible interesting stories to cover.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
687,moulika-mandal-90,Transformers: Age of Extinction (of people who watch it),3,27 August 2014,"Transformers: Age of ExtinctionMichael Bay's fourth Transformers movie, and a lot of new characters. With Sam Witwicky(Shia LaBeouf) and Mikaela Banes(Megan Fox) totally out of the picture, (Well, Megan Fox was out in the third part itself), there was some hope that this one could be different.The movie starts with Cade Yeager(Mark Wahlberg) buying a rusty old truck which later proves to be a turning point of his, his friend's, his daughter's, his daughter's boyfriend's life! Yes!! That escalated quickly! Apparently KSI company is developing their own transformers from a 'seed' for transformium that interchanges between any metal provided by Lockdown(A Cybertronian bounty hunter) in exchange for Optimus Prime. However, KSI had already been making improvised transformers using data from Megatron, creating 'Galvatron' and stronger decepticons than ever!! But to make more decepticons Megatron needs the 'seed' which was with the CEO of KSI. Now it is the autobots and Mark Wahlberg's duty to save the world from the savaging stronger-than-ever-decepticons. After ravaging half of America and China while trying to stop the decepticons from destroying the world, the autobots realize they are too weak for the new and improved decepticons. So, they resuscitate the dinobots!! I don't know where they came from or maybe I was too exhausted from all the severe action sequences among a bunch of machines to notice or may be Spielberg ran out of luxury cars, the dinobots were robots who could change into fire breathing dinosaurs!! Somebody has certainly been doing a lot of imagining. After some more bloodshed, you know, spilling machine oils and wires and metal parts being blown and pulled out, the KSI's decepticons drones and Lockdown are defeated, and ultimate prospective father-in-law and son-in-law bonding, ending the movie with a happy ending (Not sure the U.S. and China people will agree, who were still working their a**es off and going to work in Metros where there was a serious alien uprising going on. Corporate culture. Phew!). Optimus Prime leaves with the 'seed' to find the creators and, Galvatron survives and swears on revenging Optimus leaving us in terror that there will another sequel. Sit back for almost 3 hours of expensive cars randomly chasing each other, some will be transformers and some will be just cars driven by humans and good luck with keeping track over who is after whom! Large gigantic machines wrestling and destroying cities more than a 9 pointer Richter scale earthquake would do.

689,khemka-vinit,Action and graphics..yeah dats Transformers:Age of extinction,7,29 June 2014,"First thing first, my rating of the movie is just for the flamboyant use of 3D and animation technology to a level sufficient enough to carry the burden of a plot less movie. you cannot find acting/Emotions , neither in humans or in the Transformers. But enough said about that , this is 165 min of action it is what I was expecting and delivered beautifully by Michael Bay. Breathtaking fighting ,escaping scenes ,its what transformers is all about . I am a huge fan of Transformers franchise but with every movie, emotions, story and logics are being kept at abeyance by producers giving a run for money to all physicists :P . This time autobots are fighting to prevent their annihilation from their creator and humans who can go to any extent to find ways to create their own Transformers, creating mayhem in the course and giving birth to their arch enemy but now with more power . Autobots found new alliance and fought back their way to again save the humanity from a possible apocalypse at the end.One thing I think was lacking in the movie was the background music , which was phenomenal in previous release with beats from Greenday and Linkin Park , setting the mood and tempo for a Transformers movie.Though the producers tried but it didn't created that magic.So all in all its a one time flick, if you are game for some Sci-Fi action and a lover for 3D tech you will love the movie for these speciality ,I can gaurantee.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

But when he learned that overlooks the fourth part, I decided to look all the same... and did not regret.The first thing that I liked is the speed of development of the plot. All gradually. Everything is explained. No need to try to relate all the facts. It gives pleasure to watch a movie.Next, I liked the transformers themselves. Everyone has their own character, beliefs priorities. I personally liked the Hound. I think you will too.Advertising. This is a bad word for the film. Unfortunately, many People do not like being in the movie a lot of publicity. But this is the movie when it makes it even better. I smiled moments to advertise something.Music. It was something. Imagine Dragons fellows. My applause to this group. I am glad that this year they won a Grammy. Worthy. So music. This chic.

691,p-fitzke24,"Stunning effects will never make up for poor editing, plot and cinematography.",1,28 June 2014,"Like many I grew up with the Transformers, actually during the 1st generation of the show in the United States, vs. a more recent iteration. Thus the Transformers, their universe and their mythology is near and deer to me. Age of extinction starts out on an incredible high note, and completely falls apart during a movie that could have stopped more then an hour short of the 2 hour and 45 minute run time. The opening shots bring into perspective the creators of the Transformers coming to earth thousands of years in the past. They do a great job teasing the creators as you see a semi-mechanical but mainly organic hand controlling the joystick on an aircraft. Below thousands of dinosaurs are massacred, leading to what I thought would be a set up for the Dinobots, however no connection is ever made to the Dinobots. From there we start out with the typical Michael Bay entrance to a Transformers movie, some young girl wearing little clothing (presumably someone he is trying to date, ala Megan Fox and a Victoria's Secret Model) is shown on the screen, and then the explosions and bad dialogue start as well. I'm not going to drone on about a movie that really doesn't deserve to be reviewed, however I'll sum up a few other points of this extremely long winded flick. The movie takes a stab at introducing Galvatron and the Dinobots, and does so poorly in both cases. Leading to the question, what can Michael Bay actually do with great mythology and lineage in a franchise like this, with the answer being apparently nothing. There is no drama added to the 5 minutes of Dinobots that we see, with no connection to any consequence or back story that would lead to the belief that these monsters are going to save the day for the Autobots. Some of the human acting was actually quite good, however since there was no real plot line to follow it falls short as there is no consistency in creating a cohesive story line. That is truly at the core of why this movie is just awful in so many ways. Couple that with poor editing (Actors and robots talking but no audio at two-three points in the movie, i.e. bush league production), poor use of some of the greatest characters in the mythology of the Transformers, and all the other idiosyncrasies that have come to be synonymous with all things Michael Bay and you truly have a turd sandwich.For these reasons and many others I give it a 1 out of 10 and plead with Paramount to please let someone else pick up the Directors chair for installments 5 and 6!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
692,sweetangels1234,Good but not as good as the first 3,6,28 June 2014,"First of all, I am a HUGE transformers movie fan and love the first 3 movies (Even the 2nd one was good). Transformers 4 is definitely a different styled movie than the first 3 movies. It takes more of a slow going approach rather than an epic, military-based one. The visual effects are fantastic (and even better) than the first 3 films. I know that Michael Bay (which I am a fan of) is trying to lead this next trilogy into a different direction, but personally I love the style of film in the first 3. Also, I thought the sound and music that played were kind of dull and weren't as epic as before. My rating for all the films- (Transformers 1 - 8.5) (Transformers 2 - 7.6)(Transformers 3 - 9.0)(Transformers 4 - 6.0/6.5). Rarely does a film get that low of a rating for me but I thought they could of done a better job all-round. I also liked the new cast and the acting was great but the action sequences (which there were less of in Transformers 4) could have been more epic. ********A MESSAGE TO THE MAKERS OF TRANSFORMERS 5******** Please make the next film more like the first 3! Some might say ""It gets old"" but in all honesty it doesn't!! Should you see this movie? Sure. Will you like it as much as the first 3? Maybe not. Also, I was waiting for a Optimus Prime beast mode with epic music playing in the background, but there wasn't. The coolest thing he did was jump off of Grimlock and stab some stuff with NOT cool music (This scene was in one of the trailers)!

Watching this movie and seeing all this reviews has made me write my own view on this Sci-Fi Adventure. I usually don't write this stuff, but my love to the TF Franchise is stronger than my lack of free time. So, I have pointed out some tags that, by my opinion, have to be in everybody's head before buying a ticket for this movie.1. Transformers is a science fiction movie – it's not a drama, Santa Barbara or Dynasty. If you don't like big explosions, fireworks"", space ships - don't watch this movie.2. A few months ago there was an article on the Internet called Top 10 Reasons Darth Vader Was a Great Project Manager"". When Optimus Prime is a good example of Leadership, everybody talks about don't watch this movie – save your money"".3. If Dinobots look to you (and refer to you) as a Dinosaurs from Jurassic Park, or some other nature film, than please don't go and watch this movie.4. If you don't recognize the scene with the original sound from the Transformers cartoon, than you are again watching the wrong movie.5. Is the film too long? I say yes. Is the film in some aspects boring? I say yes. Has the film some story problems? I say yes. Are all there stated questions affecting my movie impression? Absolutely NOT!! For a ""little"" reference, take a peek at top 10 movie mistakes: on that list you will find fantastic movies like Apocalypse Now, The Wizard of Oz, Pirates of the Caribbean, Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, Star Wars (1977). My question is, have these movies failed because they are on a top 10 movie mistake scale? My answer is also Absolutely NOT!!6. This films is gonna hit more than 1,000,000,000$ box office. It's obviously not a bad movie as people say it isEvery human on this Planet has the right to see this movie with his own eyes. Every human also has the undisputed / question-less right on his/her opinion without any doubt. This is my opinion and I just like these sort of stress-less"" movies, where your only doubt is to buy big or giant Coke and take it with you in the Cinema. Popcorn is a must have!!I would like to thank all of you who read this review, no matter if you agree with me or not – this is not a FIFA 2014 World Cup or some other competition – it's generally speaking just another view on things that surround us and give us the ability to run away from everyday life (and everyday problems!).I'm giving this movie 8/10 just to make sure that these 2 missing"" stars are left for the fifth movie!

697,azcoyote360,Michael Bay gets lazier and lazier with plot and suckers us with Special Effects,2,1 July 2014,"So there I sat, after my 4th Transformers movie, wondering why I was even there. I had seen all 3 Transformers movies prior to this, and this one in regards to the plot, ranked lower than number 2. Michael Bay continues to sucker the viewers in with show after show of explosions and transformations, all of which are masterfully done, but at the cost of any coherent storyline. As the blockbuster franchise continues to consume the paper in our pockets, the quality and effort of the work seems to be getting lower and lower. It seems like the franchise isn't even trying anymore. They add the generic beautiful girl caked with makeup, alongside the generic big name lead, with a generic comic relief character or two to add absolutely nothing new to the movie. The plot also seemed made up along the way, and although it was unpredictable, it was because none of it ever made any sense! The acting of everyone in this movie was either terrible or two dimensional, including a poor and detached performance by Mark Wahlberg, one of his worst I've seen in years. Yet, it is hard to blame that fully on the actors when they had to follow such a boring and confusing script filled with cringe worthy one liners. SPOILERS: The amount of product placement in this movie was embarrassingly high. There was literally even a point when Mark W. grabbed a Bud light after a lengthy advertising shot, popped it open and guzzled it down for the camera. I felt like I was watching a commercial the entire movie. Then there was the random scenes, such as when one of the main cast is running through Beijing, he magically finds a fully inflated American FOOTBALL in the middle of China without even glancing at it, and uses it to fight off the bad guys. OH yeah, you know that spaceship Optimus needed to fly in and out of space during the 3rd movie? Yeah he can just fly into space now no spaceship needed. There's also this convenient legendary story that's never explained whatsoever when the dinobots are discovered for the first time. The Megatron army also was incredibly confusing. Throughout the movie, they were able to regenerate into whatever form they had previously been, and this was constantly reinforced by scenes showing them doing just this. Until the final battle sequence, where they suddenly decided to no longer regenerate and just die, without any further explanation.

Every actor introduced on the big screen has his/hers moment from beginning to the end and for our Friendly Transformers being hunted down by the government because of the last movie, them starting a war and destroying Chicago. Now we follow the Yeager-family containing Mark Wahlberg and playing as his daughter; Nicola Peltz. Being so believable as a father and daughter, putting other cinematic families under a rock and use their charisma and talent to blow them out, putting them to ever been found.Intense action sequences and a vaster scope to the series, welcoming other 12 adventures to the Transformers-saga, making it into the most important Cinematic Universe after Peter Jackson's Middle Earth.Suck by balls.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

The only thing I disliked about this movie was the constantly crying and screaming daughter. There was no reason for this movie to have her. Mark Wahlberg would have done perfectly fine on his own without her. It was a bit too long, but I saw it in the comfort of my home so it wasn't much of a problem. Also, I am not a Transformers geek, so I didn't really care that the movie didn't show much of the Dinobots.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
700,rabbithouse_5,Just so so,6,6 July 2014,"Many of the reviews I read were either singing this movie's praises or crashing on it as being terrible. Individually, my family all had the same opinion. It was not a terrible movie. The acting was good, the action was intense and the special effects were well done. On the other hand, the plot and story line definitely missed the mark and was poorly written. The movie as a whole was too long. About 15 to 20 minutes before it ended we were looking at each other saying ""okay get there already"". Some reviewers stated that this was the best Transformers movie ever. Absolutely not!!! We wouldn't go see it again, but also don't feel that it was a waste of money. We loved the previous transformer movie's though and have repeatedly watched them many times.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
701,meshugggah666,Get extincted already!,4,6 July 2014,"I thought I knew what I came for: a weak plot but tons of action and nice CGI effects. But I never expected Michael Bay to insult his audiences' intelligence with his meaningless dialogues, his giant plot holes and a story that doesn't make any logical sense. Plus, the action scenes were very weak as well, compared to the three previous Transformers movies, and they failed to cover the cheap storyline. Michael Bay probably wanted to promote the three new autobots as well as the new bounty hunter, Lockdown, for us to familiarize with them, but that didn't succeed at all. And no, using robot blood or a smoking robot, won't make them more human. Bringing back Megatron was not actually a bad idea, but we couldn't feel the chaotic tyrant thirsty for power and destruction that he was. I still give a 4 for the nice dinosaurs' scene at the end, thought it's a pretty stupid idea for robots to transform into animals. And there is no way Bumblebee could have stayed alive longer than Ratchet, I'm just saying.You know what? Slayer \m/",Transformers - Age of Extinction
702,laurencoombe26,Transformers: Age of Extinction was completely unnecessary,5,9 July 2014,"Transformers: Age of Extinction I gave this film 2 out of 5 stars.Mark Wahlberg plays a small time Texan inventor -Cade Yeager (not anything related to the film ""Pacific rim"" which I am sure somebody somewhere would get confused as both films are about giant robots. We first see him on the lookout for scrap in an old theatre where he comes across an old beaten up truck. He is particularly interested in this truck as it is covered in ""war wounds"" and in turn buys this truck and takes it home with him. This truck obviously turns out to be a Transformer. His 17 year old daughter Tess (Nicola Peltz) is not all happy with the purchase and Cade says: ""I'm asking you to look at the junk and see the treasure."" I'm sure Bay would be asking us all to do the same. I believe he plot was as follows: Kelsey Grammar-Harold Attinger A corrupt government agent who wants all alien Transformers good and bad gone, however conspires with lockdown a ruthless transforming bounty hunter to do so. Attinger gets together with an extremely wealthy tech head/inventor Joshua Joyce played by Stanley Tucci. To build replacements for the Transformers inwich can be controlled, He uses ""Transformium"" (the space metal that the Transformers are made out of) to do this. He transfers information taken from the minds of dead deception onto these transformers which undoubtedly means that eventually these robots will and do turn evil, to make matters worse they add a ""space bomb"" into this mix and ""Galvatron"" the recreation of Megaton who wants to detonate the space bomb in the most populated of places ""Hong Kong"" and the autobots are left to clear up the mess as per usual yet of course they are completely hated by all except the Yeager family and Tess's boyfriend Shay the Irish rally driver (random).Optimus lists in the help of the Dinobots eventually in which were nothing like they actually are and were written like major disappointment for everyone who requested them to be in the film (a sure winner for toy manufacturers all over though) and it all goes from there. The film seemed to be full of advertisements and I personally found it all really sickling. It seemed there was always some sort of product placement. There was a scene where an alien spaceship crashed into some sort of road and there was debris and smoke everywhere and there was bottles of beer all over the place completely undamaged and he cracks open a bottle and drinks some, most people's last reactions during such a time. There was another scene that I thought was really cringe where Joshua Joyce is demonstrating the uses of transormium to a colleague or employee, wasn't sure at all what the relationship was there and he turns this ""transformium"" into a beats by dre pill and so many more scenes like that. Transformers: Age of Extinction was completely unnecessary and really there was no point in creating a forth movie except to just grab people's money. The Transformers lacked basic character that we all saw as children and were completely changed ""for the better"" –I disagree. They were given uncanny human like characteristics and personalities that differed from the originals. It was unclear who the main character was (which isn't always a bad thing) perhaps it was Tess in her tiny shorts! However there seemed to be too many stories going on to fully understand the plot and Bay seemed to cram in a lot of unnecessary scenes to keep up with the humor like the scene with Boyfriend Shay and the Texan Romeo and Juliet law which explains why His and Tess's relations were legal",Transformers - Age of Extinction
703,isalay-49-426029,worst transformer movie ever !!!,1,28 July 2014,"I love transformers movies , i own them on blu-ray and watched each at least 5 times already , but this is complete non-sense mumbo-jumbo !!!. I've been at the premiere with my friends and everyone was bored by this movie . Acting and story was very weak , Mark Wahlberg and Micheal Bay F..ked up big this time and CGI look like in a C movie , mostly when the Galvatron and the other robots transforms in those little flying cubes or what was that . Or when BumbleBee says WTF ?? , what was that ?? it was funny but it was also sad , that robots swear. Many scenes were stolen from the last 3 movies and the final fight ? I don't even know what were they doing , because these scenes was sooooo close captured with the camera that i see almost nothing . im very disappointed !!!!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
704,patcheypirates,"Groupthink, its real",8,11 July 2014,"If there is any evidence for group mentality it is the way critics and people react to this movie, being overly harsh towards it. I get it, its the cool thing to do these days. Why bother thinking for yourself when you can just blindly agree with everyone else?People call others who enjoy this movie sheep, well I say you're even more a bunch of sheep.Now on with the review: This movie is not Shakespeare, no. However it fixed every problem I had with the previous three films. Gone are the really stupid scenes such as the one where the mother looks at baby shoes or gets high on pot brownies. There is nothing as insulting as giant metal balls in this one.The human characters are finally not too annoying, there is no clunky romance in this one. I actually like them.The action is much easier to follow because the transformers have a small team consisting of individuals for a change, not so interchangeable as previous entries in the series. No racist black robots.I even like the way Galvatron/Megatron and his army transform, some don't but it gives a contrast to the way the auto-bots transform and makes it easier to understand what is going on.Past entries the robot combat was so difficult to tell who was fighting who and why I couldn't even watch it. At least this time I knew what the heck was going on.Lockdown was a great villain, enjoyable to watch and The jokes actually made me laugh.The only thing that is kind of annoying is that the dinobots were a bit underutilized, it wasn't a deal breaker though.I don't know what people were expecting, were you all expecting to be challenged intellectually? Its an action movie, not a thinker.I seriously just think people are bashing this movie just for the sake of bashing it.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
705,FantasticZero,Autobots *BOOM* Roll *BOOM* OUT!! *BOOM*,6,11 July 2014,"To me, Transformers: Age of Extinction (or if you prefer Transformers 4) was Michael Bay's huge chance to rejig the tired Tranformer's formula into something more than 50,000 explosions, robots punching each other, and cheesy one liners that we've seen in the previous three installments. With former male lead Shia LaBeouf out of the picture, I was hopeful that the far-more-awesome (okay I'm a little biased) Mark Wahlberg would be sufficient to revitalize the franchise in a big way. So did the ""redesign"" of the famous vehicle morphing aliens deliver something that exceeds its predecessors? In a small way yes, but it really depends what you go to see Transformers movies for.Let me first lay the ground work for the conditions that I saw this summer blockbuster in, which was in IMAX 3D. I figured if I was going to see a movie that was epic in scale and scope, with huge blasts of fire, and gigantic battling heaps of metal (err""Transformium"") then I better see it the way it was intended to be seen. Lately, I have been a fan of seeing movies in IMAX 3D. I really like the sound and image quality you get out of it, for the few extra bucks it takes, and I have grown used to 3D as long as it's done in a way that improves the film. I felt it really brought out the stunning visual effects and there are some beautiful shots peppered in that also benefit from this format. However, since the run time is almost 3 hours, at some point, amidst all the chaos on the screen, it becomes a little nauseating; and that's coming from someone who considers themselves okay with watching things in 3D, so take that into consideration. For the most part the 3D looks great except you will have to deal with some classic bad tropes like ""throwing objects in your face"" or ""I'm about to shoot this gun at you"". If you haven't figured it out, the large reason why I'm writing such a big paragraph on visuals, sound, and effects is because in the past that was the anchor of what this franchise relied heavily on, and this time is no different.At the end of the day, it really depends what you like going to movies for. If you don't care about an intricate plot or solid character development, then you might find enjoyment in Age of Extinction's VFX canvas of pretty explosions,fighting spectacles, and cool backdrops (Lockdown's spaceship is quite the eye candy). That might be selling it a bit short though, to reiterate I really do think it's a lot better than at least the last two films (tied with the first). The problem I have is the wasted ""reboot"" potential of it's star power, story, and it's need to have such a ridiculously long run time (seriously it could have been 40 minutes shorter). In short, if you weren't a fan of any of the Michael Bay Transformer movies that have come before, then this probably won't change your mind. But if the idea of Optimus riding a Dinobot into the city and stabbing bad guys in the head appeals to you, then you might have something to consider.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
706,NattM,Are you not entertained...?,9,12 July 2014,"Let's be realistic people... You go to the cinema to be entertained... Right? So go and be entertained...

Just remember we live in a world that caters to needs and wants... If there is a demand, there is supply... I was thoroughly entertained.. So much so that I've seen it 3 times..!! And I certainly would love to see it at least twice more before it removed. I loved all the explosions, the cheesy lines and most importantly... All the transformations!I felt like the autobots had a lot more character, they seemed more personable a little less robotic and ""now I transform, now I protect the humans"" It's very long, but honestly- so much was crammed - what do you expect?So.. go and be entertained.

707,jhanssen-52-258249,I'm willing to forget Pearl Harbor now,9,13 July 2014,"It's about time we forgive Michael Bay for the incoherent mess that was Bad Boys 2, and the horrible wartime romance called Pearl Harbor. With the 4th installment of the Transformers franchise, he really proves that he is the best action director out there, again. I loved transformers as a kid, and I have been skeptical to every film so far, the first time I saw them, but the effects and brilliant photography has made them quite re-watchable, and then I started noticing stuff I didn't see the first time. The transformers franchise takes place in Michael Bays world. Much like Pixar movies and classic Zucker/Abrahams movies, these films have an outstanding amount of detail, and a massive control of the background and surroundings. He did make some shortcuts in both the 2nd and 3rd, but I think he is back on top with this one. The respect for the original story, and the extended universe, not to mention all the references, gives me confidence that at least someone with creative control of this film, loves Transformers, and care about them. The effects are(not surprisingly) still some of the best ever put on film, and everything looks brilliant as usual, and the story is more than good enough for an action summer flick. It has an actual original story (unlike Avengers, which ripped it's plot from Transformers 3) and references so many other films and stories it could be a Tarantino film (btw, this also happens in the previous 3 films, Bumblebees 'Kill Bill' scene from the 2st is probably the most famous)and it doesn't have all the silly plot holes or dead ends, or 'Batman Gambits'(Dark knight anyone?) which have become Hollywood hallmarks lately (and no silly plot twist ending, thank you Michael)People who don't 'understand' all the stuff that happens in this film, probably just didn't pay attention, or are the same people who didn't understand Inception. Everything is explained very carefully, and he's also willing to answer a lot of questions asked after the other movies, and even at times take care of some of the 'innocent bystanders' he is (understandably) famous for not caring about. Not to mention he does take a few stabs at his critics if you pay attention, as he did with the previous films. He may not have Robert Downey Jr. or Bruce Willis shouting one-liners, Christian Bale speaking like he's hung over, or Leonardo DiCaprios brilliantly expressive to charm viewers, but he makes up for it, and then some, with Grimlock and the rest of the Dinobots, which, tbh, would be enough for me to give it a 10 just from seeing the trailers. I gave it a 9 just to so I can seem like a reasonable guy to all the self-righteous hipsters ( I used to be one) out there who will still keep hating everything he makes (while still paying him to watch it)and because Megan Fox and Shia Labeouf are not in it, and because no movies are really 10s ,are they? PS, I don't care about the advertising, these films cost an arm and a leg, I thank GM and the US army etc. for giving Michael Bay a TON of arms and legs to play with. (it's probably the only thing either of them are good for anyway)",Transformers - Age of Extinction
708,eland001,Opportunity for a good film... completely dodged. Can I please write the next script?,4,18 July 2014,"Spoiler alert. But then, the movie was spoiled before anyone ever saw it. Rotten, actually. There was potential, but the worms got it.Dear Mr. Bay; So you and/or the powers that be decided that TF4 needed to focus more on the human characters, probably for reasons of audience/character sympathy and emotional impact. Sigh. Your audience is choosing to pay to see a movie called ""Transformers"". Shouldn't that indicate an audience set willing to sympathize with non-human characters, able to jive with the humanity of sentient beings. Shouldn't that indicate to you that you audience wants to see heroic and villainous transforming robots, not endless shaky-camera chase- and fight-scenes of bothersome human beings running for the goal line with the football (yet again) while one-dimensional transformer characters run defense(yet again). You should have invested more time in making the robot characters more human, more three-dimensional. Flesh them out, and we'd care about them. Your audience is ready to see humanity in non-humans, but only if you put it there.Example: Transformers Prime, Season 2, Bumblebee's shame and depression at his fundamental ""performance dysfunction,"" and the struggle to deal with inadequacy and feeling like he's not valued as a robot. The authors played it off like the robo-equivalent of erectile dysfunction, and the audience really felt for the guy, even while laughing.On that note, fix Bee's freaking' voice. Prime's been BROUGHT BACK FROM THE DEAD at least once in your storyline, and recovered from multiple dismemberment and torso perforations. Give Bee a voice. The whole anger/jealousy at Stinger and the ""I hate cheap knock-offs"" thing would have played so much better if his spliced lines didn't sound like background noise.There were hardly any on screen transformations. None at all for the three new Autobot characters except a few brief half-hidden snippets. Again, ""Transformer"" is in the title. You had a triple-changer character, and didn't even make use of that. So much wow-factor left so far off-screen. And transformium knock-off transformations do not count, because they are appallingly lame. If your budget runs low and you can't pay your CG guys to render transformations, then cut something else. If Galvatron and his minions are all boring cannon fodder who transform from whatever to whatever via writhing levitating cuboid helices, I just don't wanna watch.Regarding the title and storyline, I think your plot had merit, as far as ""Galvatron wants to use the seed to make lots of material to build an army."" Lots of cool stuff there, room for human idiocy/corruption/foolishness, But the dinosaur extinction tie-in was unnecessary, and way too far from the science we have (and common folks know a lot of that science - people like dinosaurs, in case you didn't notice). If the dinosaurs went extinct because they were all converted to transformium and harvested, then there wouldn't be any fossils, and associated ash layer. But we do have fossils, and indications of a global blast winter and ash deposition. And why would an entire T-rex (which also misled the audience to think the Dinobots were frozen on earth, and would be revived later in the movie) have been left behind, un-harvested? What you could have done: show the seed blasts also raising mushroom clouds. Then at least we could be left to think that most dinosaurs were converted and harvested for raw transformium (that word makes me gag), and the rest died under the global blast winter, leaving The fossil record we all know actually does exist.Dinobots - you just kinda stuck them in at the end. there's a lot of story there that you just didn't give us. Who are they? Where do they come from? Why were they imprisoned? All we know is that they are some kind of ""honorable ancient warriors"" and Optimus is apparently some kinda knight who once went on a crusade, and who the Dinobots might know of and possibly have reason to respect. Fill us in! What's all that? Don't put it in at the climax (where we need to CARE about what's happening) if you don't give us the knowledge and context to understand enough to care. You can't just stick Dinobots in cuz ""well, people like Dinobots, so let's do it."" You're doing the whole TF story from scratch, so everyone needs an origin, and character traits. The four Autobots were bad enough, but at least those cardboard cutouts had ONE dimension. Your Dinobots didn't even get to speak, and you made no use of their humanoid forms. Just imagine what you could have done with that! You wanna see a real Grimlock, fully realized with heart and soul, oomph and chutzpah? Wanna see a Grimlock you can care about, cheer for? Go see Godzilla.Soon the Star Wars geeks will get to see a film without Lucas at the reins. Please, do the same for us TF fans. Or, better yet, redeem yourself - hold your script-writers, your actors, your audience, the story, and mostly yourself to a higher standard. Apply respect, intellect, cunning and artistic craftsmanship to your next treatment or the Transformers, and the audience will thank you. And you'll still rake in the dough.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

710,ibemaximus,Disappointment,2,1 August 2014,"Very disappointing. 1) Acting was sub-par at best. I remember back when Mark Wahlberg was first starting out as an actor. I forget the movie I first saw him in as the lead, but his acting was so bad I watched several people walk out in the first 15 minutes and then 10 minutes later, myself and who I was with couldn't take it any longer and had to leave. Why did I mention this, because just as I thought M.W. was improving, he showed how actors can revert back to when they first started out. His acting was almost that bad :( He's not fully to blame as the script for his part was so so.2) What were the directors thinking?- In the movie they pair up M.W. with actress Nicola Peltz (she wasn't too bad at acting)as his daughter. What a mistake (there were plenty in this movie)! Had they made her his niece or cousin then the relationship would have been more believable, but portrayed as his daughter, it was ridicules (you will see right off the bat what I mean when you see this movie)3)Come on directors; this is an example of extreme laziness! There is a scene after M.W. and N.P. get down off this spaceship into the city where some guy jumps out of his car- he (guy from the car) says something to M.W., M.W. replies (forget what they said) but then all of a sudden M.W. brings back his hand (his hand is not shown on the screen at this point) into view and he some hows has a beverage in his hand (beer, or some kind of beverage with a cap on it)! He takes the the beverage and opens it on door frame of the guys car and drinks it. The city has just been smashed some, they are in the middle of the street with traffic, the owner of the car is presumed to be a blue collar worker and not drunk nor drinking, and some how M.W. pulls a drink out of mid-air! That is proof the directors down play the intelligence of the audience.This is a must see film ONLY due to the fact it is transformers, but that is the only reason. Don't pay to see it in the theaters and if you can get a friend to go halves or borrow a copy of it, then it might be worth the $2.00 dollars to waste your time on..MIGHT BE.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
711,lazyvlad,Avoid!,1,23 September 2014,"All right, I don't really write reviews, in fact this is my first one, and I'd probably never have written a review in my life if not for this marvelously stupendous ""masterpiece"".First off, I've never cared for the Transformers franchise (at least the movies), since they've always been the mindless flick summer pop corn movie that everyone will see, no one will remember, filled with characters we don't care about, and lots and lots of explosions. With that said, I must say, the movies always had something to offer, a way to enjoy a couple of hours of mindless action, filled with slow mo scenes that sometimes capture the imagination. This isn't one of those.It's way too long, and has perhaps the most boring characters ever written for a movie, with some of the worst dialogs I've seen on the screen. That stuff is bad. Like George Lucas Star Wars episode 1 bad. It's bad. At no time do you stop to care for the human persons running on the screen. I mean, maybe is too much to ask that from a movie of this type, especially one directed by Michael Bay, but at least the lead characters can offer some sort of comical relief, a touch of entertainment value for their time spent on the screen. They do get paid for that stuff after all.************Spoilers******* Then there is the plot, or should I say the lack of the plot. It starts with a badly written inventor and his financial struggles, while taking care of his daughter. This period of the movie is filled with bad dialogs, but bearable, slow camera work that is suppose to explain some things about the life of this person that is probably genius, but has the biggest collection of not finished devices. It doesn't work at all with Mark Wahlberg , I just can't see Mark as this geeky inventor, who somehow is good at Football and has a buffed up body, probably from all that work in the garage. Never the less up to this point the movie gets a pass, since it's way too common for summer blockbusters to open like this. Then he meets Optimus Prime, and everything goes to hell. During the remaining portion of the movie, the characters (including Optimums) go through a ton of character transformations that makes the whole thing hard to follow. His daughter who is supposed to be this smart girl (who helps him with his checkbook and his inventions) turns into this yell machine that can only say words like ""dad, DAAD , Dad"" and ofc cares only for her boyfriend in death like situations. Mark ofc goes from a geek good with tech, into a more suiting role for him, Jason Bourne. He is just natural with all that stuff, killing, fighting, jumping out of moving vehicles. It's just him. Optimus can't find his identity most of the movie, he hates the humans, he loves the humans, the doubts are never ending. In the end he transforms himself into a rocket, unveiling perhaps the best symbolism in the movie: ""Get the f*ck out of there"".This thing should be avoided, since it is an epitome of ""how to badly do a summer blockbuster"", and it looks more like a container for 10+ commercials (seriously the product placement in this movie is so obvious there is like a full sequence of a beer commercial in the middle of it) than a movie.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Yes, there was way too much product placement and a lot of action but at least it was different to the past 3 films, which in my opinion,were incredibly similar. I think the storyline was actually quite interesting and the acting itself very good. The biggest downfall was probably the length. At over 2 hours long it's a bit much, especially when the first half has lots of storyline and little action and the second half little storyline and lots of action.

I have read through the reviews and very few gave this movie more than 3 stars. It was terrible! Hard to watch. Acting was awful! Must be some studio minions hyping this movie?!?I am very surprised that anyone liked Marky Mark over Shia, it was not a good casting at all. Wahlberg was great in Lone survivor, Broken City, The Fighter, Invincible... but in this movie he was supposed to play a neurotic failed robot inventor and he floundered. It was extremely poor acting reminiscent of Pain and Gain, another failed attempt by Wahlberg at neuroses. The description says he is a mechanic, I was expecting Sparkplug: a dumb jock but loyal and hard working (where Wahlberg excels) but instead I am supposed to buy him as a sub-genius robotics inventor/ former football star? At least with Shia he played the neurotic role well. It is what Shia does well and what we expect from him. Wahlberg doesn't fit this role at all and clearly this was not written with him in mind. Other than the poor casting and worse acting, this movie fails exactly where the newest Superman and the newest Thor movies did: no plot, overdone CGI, and seemingly invincible antagonists and protagonists. I hope Hollywood gets a clue that when you have two invincible enemies fighting and destroying whole cities or worlds it is not entertaining! Especially when one of them is killed in one swift sequence. The insurmountable odds concept only works with quick wits, and a great plot.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

VERY WRONG!",2,7 October 2014,"Micheal Bay has obviously lost his ""The Rock"" touch, giving us piles of dog pooh for breakfast like Revenge of the Fallen and Armageddon. But what made this any different. Well, more. A lot MORE! And its 3 hour runtime doesn't help. The main thing wrong was the little things that he overlooked like the toned-out acting, the rehashed moments from District 9 and the things that flat-out made no sense, like that Transformer alien gun that was made in perfectly human size, and also trying to trick us into thinking it was a sword. And I'm not even going to mention the exhausting and stupid Michael Bay humour. I'll sum it up like this: If you took your girlfriend to see this movie, she would break up with you, and it won't be the action-movies-clichés' fault. THE worst movie of the year, period.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

I mean Transformers 3 wasn't good as all, but good 3D effects and great soundtrack can help so much! But after I've seen the Transformers 4 trailer, you know with the T-Rex that is ridden by Optimus Prime, I was disappointed in so much ways, but I wanted to build my own opinion. So I go to the cinema and watch this house without any floor! I mean I've seen really bad movies, but something like this in a Hollywood format no! After 10 min. I can't see Optical flares no more! Really 10000 Lens flares in 10 minutes... And after the 10 page story was tell we can explode everything! This is the reason why I slept 35 min. in the cinema! So at first I was thinking Okay may in this 35 min. happened something...."" so I watched the movie again on DVD and I can say(wait)The movie is Bad!!!!!! If I could, I would give out 0 Stars out of 10!

This is the fourth chapter in the Transformers series, and Michael Bay has done a super duper job. Editing, camera work, special effects, music, everything is top notch, and gives you a complete movie experience. Leading actor Mark Wahlberg is too good as the human element of this work of digitized huge robots, Autobots, Decepticons, etc fighting with each other. But if I had a criticism it would be that after a while, the energy of the movie drops a bit, but die-hard Transformer fans will surely over look that. As a watcher of action movies, large scale destruction is something I look forward to seeing in films like this, and there is lots of this here. This is a huge budget Hollywood movie and every penny they spent is worth it with the action sequences and the grand acting by greats like Stanley Tucci.

Maybe for the first film you could let things go by, but by the fourth round you have to start actually putting some effort into the story. I am a college graduate with multiple degrees and I have no idea what the movie's plot was. God help the little kids whom watch this film (who I'm guessing these films are aimed at). They need to really reboot the franchise, and put the film into someone's hands whom understands story, themes, character development.

The movie is fifteen minutes longer then the other 3 and people say too long??? I say not enough transformers scenes. It's almost a hour before Optimus reunites with the others however cut scenes out you'd be more confused. There are some lines that I wonder why did they write that? Makes the Maine character look stupid but at the same time it's funny. I think people are just confused about the plot cause there's a couple twists and if you don't notice then your confused. This is a great movie compared to say Annabelle yes ik different genre but I was expecting to be scared that I wouldn't sleep for days but I wasn't at all. This movie had what I was expecting.

Its like they dint even try to make a movie with a story. Not only is age of extinction a bad movie, its painful.The story is soo flat, though the idea is good, the way its represented is horrible. Well this is what almost all the TF movies suffered, but this one has crossed the limits. Leaving Mark Wahlberg and Stanley Tucci, no one has done good acting especially Nicola Peltz. The combat and transformations are boring. The new characters are pointless and uninteresting. They are just put in the film for the sake of more characters. Crosshairs is not seen transforming or battling even once. I love the dinobots though, but they are just side characters. Above all, this movie is soooooo long. This even adds to the boringness.

I felt pretty good entertained. Effects are as good as always, battle and scenery impressive and well done.Excellent: For me Mark Wahlberg was like a fresh breeze with some funny slapstick moments.

Sadly, I was expecting more on the story front. Echoing the sentiment that the world has had enough of Autobots, the film kicks off with the auto bots being hunted down. A broke Texan engineer, Cade Yeager is the one who lands up in trouble after he buys a broken truck which he intends to dismantle and sell off to fund his daughter Tessa's college education. My only problem with this film is its story which affects the action bits too! The drill was that the humans kept getting caught and kept getting out of it. The too-much-excitement becomes a staple after a point, when you tend to become unfeeling about it. The Hong Kong based climax probably appeases the fans of the franchise in the region, but is in my opinion a slack ending of sorts.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

The new synthetic transformers can evaporate? I'm done. This movie deserves a one star despite having a friend of mine cast in it as an extra.

Never thought I'd get bored of explosions.Marky Mark tries his very hardest. Stanley Tucci is kind of cool at first, then becomes a little too goofy and cheesy. Kelsey Grammar is in this. The characters are mostly poop. Optimus Prime is not himself. Marky Mark tries to be likable. He sort of succeeds. I hated his daughter. Her boyfriend is even worse. There is a scene near the end where he almost died and I thought to myself: ""If he dies, this movie will go from a '3' to a '5'."" Sadly, he lived.

Seventeen! year old daughter Tessa. Wahlbergs portrayal of Cade has as much personality as a Toyota anno 1995.Only real good acting done, is done by Kelsey Grammar, portraying Harold Attinger a C.I.A Agent gone bad and teamed up with the baddies. Then there is product placements, it's probably why it's so long, there had to be time to dump in references of all the products used in the film, not to mention completely out of the plot scenes of Cade holding and drinking energy drinks demonstratively.And then there is Dinosaurs, somebody in the script team was obviously clapping their chubby little hands in excitement over this.I imagine it went something like this.Michael Bay: We need an idea, what is cooler than Robots that turn in to CARS? Team: Uhm.. dunno, toasters?Michael Bay: noo, be seriousTeam: how about... boats?Michael Bay: Kinda limited to water only, don't you think? and we already have helicopters, those are coolTeam: Well, how about... this may sound crazy, but... DINOSAURS!!!

It is literally three hours of money shots, each one with a more in your face product placement than the last. Remember what happened to Shia Labouf the other night, with handcuffs and the arrest and everything? If this movie had gone on five minutes longer, the same thing would've happened to me! It's not just lowest common denominator filmmaking, it's that the lowest common denominator isn't near low enough for this movie filmmaking. The dialog and the jokes actually clang louder than all the smashing metal. You might as well hold your breath until you see pretty colors then watch a bunch of commercials. Save yourself the twenty bucks and the IMAX 3D experience which btw, doesn't disguise the lousiness, it just enhances it.I had made the mistake of choosing some (ahem) prime real estate for my seat. This of course surrounded me by other masochists who sat next to me. For the first five minutes of the movie, there was one who was messing around on his phone and the white screen was annoying me to the point where I almost had to say something.

No matter what your feelings are of him as a human being, he brought charisma and humor to his role as Sam. I cared what happened to him, except when he ""died"" and was brought back to life by the Autobot Gods.Age of Extinction is a 3 Hour Commercial; yes I know that's how many of Michael Bay's films can be categorized. However, previous outings were a lot more subtle about the straight money grab. In one slow motion sequence the viewer is exposed to 2 clothing line advertisements along with a beverage advertisement.Marky Mark is fine as our new hero, but there is barely any character development that makes you believe he's able to do half the things in this film. Don't get me started with his daughter/boyfriend duo, nothing good can be said about them. Why on Earth would an Irish accented Hemsworth brother wannabe be living in Texas anyways?The action sequences are decent, though I was sad they didn't utilize Bumblebee as much as in the previous films. I'd like to say that I'm done, that I won't be seeing the 5th and 6th films in theaters.

740,vkemerald89,"Finally, all of the alien action I've been craving!!",9,29 June 2014,"I for one, watch TF for the alien action, NOT the human drama. Needless to say, this sequel ultimately delivered. The beginning was kind of drawn out, uneventful, and a bit sad for me, but was by no means unbearable. Besides, the action in the rest of the film more than made up for it. I especially love the increased focus on OP's ""humanity"", if you will, and on the TF in general. It's refreshing to see more of the film (than before) through the perspective of the TF rather than humans.As always, the animation was amazing and the stunts, wicked awesome. Any that we've seen before were redone bigger and better. Contrary to what some of the trolling commenters are saying, there are a ton of great action sequences! If you actually went and saw the film, you would know this. I am glad I didn't take those nasty reviews to heart and I definitely do not regret attending the 3D, surround sound showing. Seriously, don't listen to those reviews- especially the ones that claim specific things didn't occur in the film, because many of them DID occur and they were AWESOME!True, the advertising was more obvious in this film, but hey, if the few extra seconds help foot the bill, then whatever. It didn't detract from my movie experience. The story line could have used more work as it progresses haltingly, and the ""extinction"" idea may not be fully understood until over halfway through. It is much easier to follow though, so that's a nice change.However, if you've loved the TF universe before these films, you'll likely appreciate the variety of characters and the evolution of this installment of the franchise.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

I am 36. I know what they are about and what they represent. Mr Bay has been true to the concept and originality of Transformers. People have absolutely no idea what they are on about and are trashing this film for no reason. This is not a suspense thriller (although there is plenty of thrill and suspense), it is not a psychological thriller or even a love story. Then they complain about a poor plot. Are you INSANE! I mean what planet do you come from. Oh and another common complaint has been that the film is too long. Well guess what, the film is not long enough for me. I loved it. It has the right amount of character development, plot development, romance, action (plenty of that) and great one-liners. The CGI is great (we watched it in 3D which was awesome). Optimus Prime is absolutely unbelievable. Kind, warm, honourable, dignified, brave, fearless and yet vulnerable, brutal, fierce and angry at the betrayal of humans. This in my opinion is the best instalment to date. Can not wait for the rest to follow.

Except for superhero movies DC and Marvel (I read comics) and ... the Michael Bay movies ! At each of the them I become a kid again and i take a lot of fun (except Pearl Harbor).In short to return to T4, is for me the best of the series. Because the tone is a little darker, and this time the hero is a grown man. I feel closer to Cade Yeager that Sam Witwiky. I have also enjoyed the evolution of the story. Humans are now able to create Transformers, idea pretty cool. The action scenes are breathtaking (Bay is the king of the genre) and ... there are Dinobots! Hopefully they take up more space in the next film.Speaking of the upcoming film I sincerely hope that Michael Bay will realize it. We hear rumors about Jonathan Liebesman, this director has made some watchable movies but it is millions of miles from the inventiveness of a Michael Bay. It's like comparing a bicycle to a Corvette.

I just wanted to see a basic action movie, and my expectations were low, of course. But what I saw, oh man, is literally the biggest gimmick/cliché of a movie that has come out of the ass of Big H, ever. This film can easily be compared to Godzilla (1998) and how it embarrassed the legacy of an entire franchise. Yes, it is THAT bad. Now, I'm not gonna go into detail about the main characters and plot, but let me tell you; it doesn't matter if you are a believer of a deity or not, because, after seeing this movie, you will be saying, and I quote: ""Oh, my, f***ing, God"". This movie includes white trash teens, Mark Wahlberg, mecha dinosaur transformers, hilariously unrealistic scenes (even for sci-fi), beyond bad acting, and all the HOWs and WTFs reminiscent of every movie that gets a below average score on IMDb. Just do yourself a gargantuan favor and stay away from this film, because I have never seen anything this bad in a long, long time. I seriously wanted to leave the cinema after the first 10-20 minutes, but I stayed to be a living witness of the horror. Even though I wanted to kill myself, I had to survive. I had to tell you guys about this piece of s**t that is even below Batman & Robin (1997) level. Yes, that's right.

Even with his best heroic effort, Mark Wahlberg could not save this film. He barely managed to be mildly convincing in his earnestness to save his daughter from all the evil humans and machines. Admittedly, this in itself could be considered quite a feat given the incredulous stupidity of what constituted a plot. What the first film had, and the third one at times achieved, were Autobots with whom the audience could at least identify. This movie utterly lacked any semblance of the rapport that Shea LaBeouf had established with Bumblebee in the previous films. Here Bumblebee was little more than a caricature. Optimus was dogmatic and stifled. All the machines, the Autobots most especially, were for the lack of a better word, soulless. The movie would have been improved by removing all human/machine interactions. When a Transformers movie would be better without any Transformers in it, then that in itself is sad statement.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
746,jaycee_hotchocolate,Not too bad but not too good either,6,3 July 2014,"Whenever I watch movies I intend to enjoy it - there has got to be at least a little bit of something that I'm interested in before I will commit to watching a movie, then after knowing the type of movie it is I will change my mindset on how seriously I will take it, especially when it comes to Science Fiction, I believe that this genre cannot be taken too seriously but it cannot be too stupid and unrealistic either. I have no idea what the transformers were, being brought up in Hong Kong. Before the first movie of this Franchise, there weren't any movies or cartoons of transformers shown on TV, and what attracted me to watch the first one was mostly because of the trailer. I thought that the first movie wasn't bad at all and I become a fan of the whole Transformers idea.With that said, after watching the movie, I wouldn't say it was as bad as many people claimed it to be, but it isn't that good either.Let's start with the goods first:First of all I'd like to say that I like the direction of partially rebooting the series. I believe the focus should be more on the transformers, so it's a nice change to see different human characters but Optimus Prime and Bumblee still around. I think that Mark is a nice choice too as it's nice to get a refreshing style of storyline and instead of the kid being the main human character we have the dad be it for a change.It's also a nice change to see not only the USA but another country get attacked for a change, it brings Hollywood Sci-Fi to another level, especially since the last 40 mins or so were based in Hong Kong. It makes it more realistic as if ever there were to be an event like transformers trying to take over earth I like how it wasn't only USA being threatened but other countries too.The CGI is quite impressive, and I have always loved how the animation of the transformers transforming and there were quite a lot of that in this film. I also liked how there were more scenes that had both humans and transformers in the shot, it gives us a better perspective of the size difference between the transformers and humans. The action isn't anything too spectacular, but it isn't bad neither. It's just probably because I also watch other superhero movies and racing movies and I couldn't find anything that stands out to make this movie really spectacular in that department.What disappoints me though is the attention to detail. I already set my mindset to be less serious and more of a go with the flow type of mentality while watching the movie but there are moments in which left me hoping for something better.First of all is character development. I watched a film that's nearly 3 hours and yet I left the film not knowing much about the 3 new autobots. It's like they were just forced into the movie. It would have been nice to have even just a brief background story as to how and why they are where they are, especially since since the first movie Optimus said their world has already been destroyed.Then when it comes to realism, most of us should know by now that Hong Kong is a small place at the southern part of China. With that said, the scene where Optimus Prime calls on the Dinobots was rather unrealistic, as it's impossible to have a 'cave' that big in a place like Hong Kong. I know it's fiction, but still at least it could have been more realistic?Lastly what bothers me most is how they portray Tessa. If she was really supposed to be a 17 year old girl in the movie, were the outfits and the jokes in the film necessary? In the end, Transformers:Age of Extinction isn't that bad of a movie. If you love action and robots, enjoy Michael Bay movies (I'm not really a fan of his btw) or are a fan of the Transformers idea itself you'll surely enjoy this film. But if you are the type that pays a lot of attention to the details, find realism important in movies or are looking for an intelligent movie with twists and turns, this might not be the movie for you as you will end up desiring for more or feeling like something is missing.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Mark Walberg's awesome! Only real problems are the completely useless main characters. Well, two of them anyway.And it was a bit long.Otherwise, I left the theater grinning and laughing. It is a great bad-movie and good if you don't feel like using your brain, and maybe when you could use a little adrenaline rush.I'm a little more hopeful for TMNT now.Just a little.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
748,johnwrot-2,Horrific and False Advertising,1,24 October 2014,"Michael Bay needs to stop ruining our childhood.The only thing this film did right, and I mean the ONLY thing, is they finally cleaned up the Transformer's animation so you can kinda actually see what's going on during a fight. That's it. Now the bad...Question:Who went to see the movie to watch Optimus Prime almost die... AGAIN? Nobody. Who went to see the movie to watch Optimus Prime start whining about his loosing faith in humanity... again? Nobody. Who went to see the movie to watch Optimus Prime pull a Zack Snyder and kill somebody? Nobody.Who went to see this movie TO SEE THE DINOBOTS!!!?!!!EVERYBODY! Everyone. Every - one. Guess what? The Dinobots are in the movie for a painfully ineffective 12 minutes. The Dinobots are not named. Nope, not one; not even Grimlock. The Dinobots are wusses... One falls off a ledge into water and is out; another is flying, then suddenly stops and crashes into a building for no apparent reason; and Grimlock, oh yes the big tough leader, get's back-fisted in the face ONCE by a robot 1/3rd his size, dislocates his jaw, and passes out. ... Yeah.None of them talk. None of them successfully do any severe damage. None of them show a relative imperviousness to pain or damage. NONE OF THEM ARE DINOBOTS!Michael Bay should be sued for false advertising (or at least for making crappy films). It's nothing short of a depressing waste of your time.

I am glad the movie made past 100 million mark, another well done job from Bay, but i recommend everyone to see this sequel , i never had love for any critics , i always wen to see it for myself and never listen to anyone's opinion, and this was definitely well worth it.

750,AndreCG94,The worst of the series,5,6 July 2014,"I walked into the cinema with low expectations, like any other person would after watching the latest chapter in the series. Couldn't say I expected much from Michael Bay, beside extended special effects and tons of metal robots. Truly, it was the worst film from all four. What started out as an interesting attempt to bring depth into the Transformers universe quickly succumbed with almost three hours of terrible acting and weak storyline. The only positive aspect was the (already expected) very good CGI scenes. Nicola Peltz would likely be a strong candidate for the award of worst actress, if there was one, and she was clearly only added to the film to cativate the male audience. A decent attempt, but it was not enough I'm afraid.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
751,krazyfrog87,"Long, boring, incoherent and a complete mess of a movie",3,26 June 2014,"Let me preface this by saying I'm a big Transformers fan. I love the series. I love the concept. I loved the animated series that used to air on TV. I even loved the previous Transformers movies. (Well, maybe not the third one, but I thought it was okay.) It is one of my favorite franchises and I just watched it being butchered for over two and a half hours.Transformers: Age of Extinction is a disaster. I was thrilled to get the chance to see it before most of the world but ended up being thoroughly disappointed. The movie is 165 minutes of incoherent nonsense and if you thought that's what the previous movies were, well, you might start appreciating them after seeing this.First of all, it has that god awful Michael Bay humor that we saw in the previous movies. It's not funny at all and there is so much of it so often it makes you cringe. It's like watching a senile old man running naked on the street. It's sad and it makes you feel uncomfortable.But that stuff was there before as well. What I loved about the Transformers movies, or what anyone loves about them, was watching the robots transform and fight. The previous movies had memorable moments. I still remember the scene from the first movie where Ironhide jumps up and shoots missiles mid-air in slow motion as the woman is screaming below, and Starscream jumping and transforming mid-air and flying off, Sideways getting sliced in half by Sideswipe, Scorponok rising from the ground, and the brief scenes with Demolisher and Devastator in the second movie and finally the Shockwave sequences and that time Bumblebee transforms with Shia LaBeouf still in the car from the third movie.But nothing of that sort happens in this movie. Other than Optimus Prime and Bumblebee, there are three other Autobots in the movie, all of whom are new. They try to come across as interesting but you don't really give a damn about them. Bumblebee is so seldomly seen on screen you forget he's even there in the movie. And Optimus Prime goes through his usual routine of getting his ass thoroughly kicked in the first half of the movie, only to rise again later, something which has been a common theme of previous movies. This is why I don't feel particularly strongly about the movie version of Prime because he fails so often and so hard in combat it's difficult to take him seriously as a leader.There are plenty of action sequences in the movie but the first half has about 10% of them. And considering the first half is about 90 minutes long it means you are treated to a lot of talking and other stuff that is either plain stupid or just boring. When sh*t does start hitting the fan later, it's just a bloody mess, with so much happening at once that you don't care about anything and none of it is particularly cool or memorable. There is also the nausea-inducing shaky camera technique being thoroughly abused here, which actually makes it hard to see what's going on because everything is shaking so god damned much all the time. Except when there is a product placement going on, then the camera is absolutely still so you can see the brand name clearly.The only redeeming aspects of this movie are the exceptional CGI with some stunning 3D and the incredible sound. The movie looks and sounds fantastic and if you do make the mistake of watching it, do it in IMAX like I did because otherwise there will be nothing there to enjoy. (This film does have the highest amount of IMAX footage I've seen in any movie, with practically half the movie being in IMAX. However, I did not like the way it constantly keeps jumping between IMAX and non-IMAX footage between every other scene. This probably won't bother you as much as it bothered me and if you watch it in a regular theater then you won't see it at all.)Overall, Transformers: Age of Extinction is a horrible mess of a movie and a complete waste of time and money. The previous Transformers movies were a guilty pleasure and scratched a very specific itch for a very specific audience but this one doesn't even do that while inheriting all the flaws of its predecessors. It takes a special kind of idiot to mess up something so simple but Michael Bay does it with aplomb.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

To make two outstanding movies, the scenes would have to be expanded which would enhance the story and eliminate the choppiness of the entire movie. The division between the movies would take place where the main actress was taken up into the ship with Optimum Prime. What a cliff hanger that would have been. Unfortunately, this movie was conceived with the wrong motives in mind. Making two movies from this would have ensured a new generation of committed movie goers. However, it ruined the desire of many current ones to stay loyal to the trend.

Two thumbs to him for doing it right at the right time. Removing Shia was also a good move, although he is an excellent actor but Mark has pulled it off, no doubt about it.

Actors (if we can name them this way) don't act or poorly. What are Mark Wahlberg and especially Stanley Tucci doing in this piece of crap (probably some unpaid bills to settle) ?

756,nickoliver81,What more do we expect from Bay,5,20 September 2014,"As I expected very disappointing. The story is weak, acting was poor and despite being a childhood fan I found myself being bored and disinterested. It had potential to be interesting but no, despite having Creators in the background of the story, Galvatron was made by humans. Would of been much better if Galvatron and new Decepticons were made by the Creators. Also, Why would Lockdown work with the Humans? Story tellers insistence on having a major human bad guys is not needed and as a result brings the story potential down.Everybody loved the Dinobots but even this is disappointing. In the film for 3 minutes out of 2 hour 45 minute. Grimlock doesn't talk and explain why he suddenly attacks prime despite setting him free. The scaling was all wrong, one minute prime is the size of his head then half the size. And then at the end prime sets them free from his command and they run off like they are going to roam free in Hong Kong - patheticBay managed to find a more terrible female lead than Fox who is just jail bait eye candy. Every now a then the film zooms in at her short shorts for a minute while the so called story drags on - just go online for any your see plenty of half naked girls. Mark Wahlberg playing a geeky stay at home single dad inventor (yeah great one).Fans deserve a decent film that reflects the greatness of the franchise. Bay will never deliver that film. After seeing guardians of the galaxy the other day I was reminded how action films can integrate humour, action and a great story line. All I would say and I am preaching now is at least I wasn't part of the box office success of this film because all the time people keep running to the cinema to watch this then Bay will continue to ruin the franchise and make more.

To Michael Bay: TOO MUCH (ADs)!! 3. Though not for the story, but the plot sucks.Transformer was a series developed in US, but this new movie has too much features of other country. As a viewer from that country, I really don't agree these features which ruin the culture, makes me feel that TF4 is a movie funded by that country, produced by that country, only happens to have the director and crew names of Transformer franchise. Besides, characters of Autobots are too human-like, too much emotion, over designed appearance (like silly online game characters).Last, as a minor part, I would say the plot is lack of sophisticated arrangements and geological knowledge, though I know it's just an entertainment market piece.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

First 1 hour of the movie was good, but the latter was boring and will test your patience.Only best thing about the movie was the visual effects, apart from that everything is same as u have seen in before parts.. ""Earth is in Danger, blah.. blah.. blah.."" dragged.. dragged.. dragged.. for around 2 hours 45 minutes..Bay could not utilize star power of Mark Wahlberg replacing Shia LaBeouf. And also I could not understand what happened to Galvatron remade from Megatron, he fights with Optimus only once in the movie at around first half of the movie. He will not even fight in the climax. Also all the once Optimus prime fights with will be dead, but Optimus will not, even if he get missile hits and will get stabbed but will survive, This magic only works on him, which we have seen in almost every Transformer movie... I don't understand why only he can survive and other will die..??Funniest part of the movie was in climax When Lockdown tries to attack Mark, he holds him with his Sword gun with his hands successfully..I almost cried watching that scene stupidest scene I have seen this year after Godzilla movie..

I am a huge Transformers fan, but this review will not contain any of my biases. Let's get straight to the point: The pros and cons. First, the cons: 1) This movie is lonnnnnngggggggg. Most reviewers have pointed this out already, and they are correct. They could have shaved 30 minutes of this movie and made it better. 2) Not enough transforming. Yeah, you get to see a lot of the transformers in action, but I felt like they didn't go from car to robot very much.The pros: 1) This movie has a better story and script than the last 2. I find it funny how people always talk about how bad the script is in these movies. IT'S AN ACTION MOVIE THAT'S FOCUSED ON CGI!! If you want script, go watch ""Syriana"" or ""Eat, Pray, Love"" and be bored out of your mind. With that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed watching a Transformers movie without Shia Labeouf screaming and talking 100 miles an hour. 2) CGI once again was unreal. It is absolutely breathtaking to watch the action scenes on the big screen. Those scenes are worth the price of admission. 3) The new characters. I honestly did not like Transformers 2 mainly because of the dumb robot twins. T4 has a much better cast of Autobots and it was nice to see some new villains as well. Overall, this movie is very good for what it is intended to do. Yes, it could edit 30 minutes out and show more transformations. Other than that, it's very fun and exciting to watch on the big screen. I rated it 7/10, but I would give it another .5 point if I could.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Personally, this o's my favorite of the movies next to the first. It was definitely a little too long. I almost feel like the first hour and a half could have been covered in about 45 minutes.

Admittedly the character development between the opening scene and the OPTIMUS bust out seemed to drag but actual time wise it did not. The setup for a second generation of Transformer movies with members of the current cast is a strong possibility.

Not to say that there isn't plenty of that, but the slow, awkward buildup to what should be epic scenes left me frustratingly unsatisfied. It's really astonishing how a 3+ hour movie fails to explain huge plot points, and the lack of explanation also hugely subtracts from what could be awesome scenes. The ""comedy"" in this thing just would not stop. It seemed at least every 5 seconds, during even the most serious and crucial action scenes, a character would crack some witless line that made it that much harder to enjoy, and I honestly hoped to enjoy this. Because of a couple more satisfying scenes and slightly better buildup that was in the last movie, I actually prefer the 3rd in the series. Some (very little) of the comedy here induced a laugh, and as usual 100% of any action satisfaction that can be found here comes from Optimus Prime. Mark Wahlberg means nothing to me, and almost every other human was either annoying, or completely insufferable.

If they had put as much effort into the dialogue as they did the visuals then this could have turned out to be a real hit. Other than that the movie was long and just very disappointing. Kelsey Grammar and Titus Welliver were super stars in this movie. I found them to be probably the strongest in the movie with some of the better dialogue to be had. I did however think that Mark Wahlberg did a good job with what he had to work with. I found the dialogue between him and his daughter's boyfriend to be very cheesy at best. The boyfriend I thought was really bad all the way around and I didn't find any real chemistry there between him and the girl. Nicola Peltz I found to be very good as well and extremely beautiful which could cloud my judgement a bit but none the less when I said the movie had great visuals I was also thinking of her.

774,ddixonva,Disappointing even for a longtime TF fan who enjoyed the previous films.,3,6 September 2016,"How strongly did I feel after watching this movie? Enough that this is my first-ever IMDb review.I'm unabashedly nostalgic for G1 as so many kids born in the late 70s to early 80s can relate to, but until now I have been OK with the Bay movies. I figured ""OK, the alternate modes are a bit different, but at least we're seeing this stuff in live action on the big screen""... ""OK, they've done some different characterizations (e.g. Bumblebee's broken voicebox; Starscream's lack of usurpation - or personality at all, really; the relatively dumb Wheelie and Brains...), but we've still got Peter Cullen being the same Prime we always had!""... ""Wow, that Devastator is, er, unrecognizable, and, wait, redneck robots?"" - you see where this is going, and I've only touched on a couple of the movies.Still, the first one I liked, the second one I liked some, third one was OK... just enough nostalgic beats to keep my inner child paying attention, just enough visual stuff to keep my adult brain thinking it looked cool, and overall at least entertaining when it wasn't leaning too hard on Sam being awkward (because reasons!) or the female leads being hot, or Sam's mom being stoned out of her gourd.This time around, though, several times during the movie I just had to say ""...What?!"" I'll make a handy-dandy list:1. Once again, the two sides largely comprise entirely new players, rather than more of the established characters from the history of the franchise. (For a second, seeing the blue Bugatti projecting film onto the rock wall near the start of the film made me hope that it was Mirage, but, nope)2. Plus, the new autobots continue the tradition of WTFery... Drift (nice, a nod to triplechangers!) is a seriously bad Japanese caricature. I'm not one to call 'racist' at characters just for being stereotypical, and I think 'being offended' is ridiculous in general, but without any kind of backstory on why this alien lifeform picked up so much feudal japan with his spark or scan or whatever, it just feels silly and bad.Crosshairs is basically an asshole trying to be in charge. You know, like Starscream always was, over on the Decepticon side, because that's how Decepticons think and act.Hound is a reimagining of a classic character, and I suppose he wasn't too bad in and of himself, but he didn't remind me of the original Hound; and FFS, what is with ""smoking"" a live shell like a cigar? 3. Bumblebee is an entirely different car every time we see him across the movies – long as it's a Camaro, of course. First movie, I understand, older beater car to get to Sam and then he feels he needs an upgrade to impress the girl, but then we get 2 or 3 even-newer iterations of the same Camaro before Bee starts this 4th movie as a 90% black, first-gen Camaro (inarguably the coolest car he has been throughout the movies' run, at least) but then of course switches back to the new 2016 to infiltrate KSI after the '67 version of him gets thrown out. Side note: The word 'Camaro' now means nothing to my brain after that many repeats (and some I edited out). I'm definitely wishing for classic Bumblebee after this many Camaro versions.4. Probably my biggest gripe, character-wise: Optimus Prime is so angry in this film that he's generally kinda shady-feeling. He even goes against his own philosophy: His big inspirational thing has always been ""Freedom is the right of every sentient being,"" yet as soon as they unleash the Dinobots he goes into ""either you help us or I kill you"" mode. I get that in his position and knowing what they've been through he's rightfully incensed, but that's, I dunno, just not Prime.5. The Decepticons were well not a threat? Besides Lockdown - operating alone, not really as a card-carrying, faction-loyal Decepticon here – the rest of the enemy threat was pretty minor. Galvatron might have had the mind of Megatron in there, but beyond his nifty pencil-sharpener midsection, meh. Throw in a couple of Bumblebee-cloned Stingers and a host of other Chevy vehicles that don't get names and you've got the robot version of Batman and Robin fighting domino-masked, stripe-shirted mooks in 1966 Gotham. Shame, because Prime and Bee fighting Evil Prime and Bee could've been fun.6. Transformium. Maybe the biggest WTF of the whole movie. One small point about it: If the stuff can just change into *anything*, as demonstrated, there is no need for the man-made robots to have recognizable car parts. Poof, it's a car, poof, it's a robot – no shared mechanicals or even colors are necessary according to what they show this stuff doing.As for the actors:Tessa and Shane – not fantastic, but I didn't actively hate them. I like Mark Wahlberg in most things I've seen him in, but his portrayal of Cade has zero believability - you don't feel like he's an inventor, you don't even feel like he's actually a father. I'm not *every* dad, but I am *a* dad, to a teenage daughter, and I just can't buy it here.Stanley Tucci, he's great. He took what they gave him and turned in a decent performance - there could have been a little more gravitas to his heel-face turn, but it'll do. And Kelsey Grammar, well, he's pretty good at that kind of role - Arrogant General #24561 off the assembly line. No complaints.Sooo yeah: Hey Hollywood - you keep rebooting Spiderman, Xmen, F4, etc. Why not reboot TF with a team that'll do it more loyally?",Transformers - Age of Extinction
775,Alexrivet,Transformers: Age of Extinction,7,6 July 2014,"This is my first ever IMDb review so I'll keep it simple by dividing my review into the stuff I liked and stuff I didn't really like. Alright, the stuff I liked: The action was amazing like all the other movies. Michael Bay continues to outdo himself with each new film. The cast of human characters was a welcome change and I'm excited to see them again in the next film. Mark Wahlberg is way cooler than Shia LaBeouf and is a better lead in my opinion for these movies. Stanley Tucci was also great, he definitely had the funniest part in the movie. Nicola Peltz is my favourite out of the three girls in the series, but that's because I think she's the hottest. The transformers themselves look awesome as always. Optimus Prime's new look is badass and speaking of badass.. The DINOBOTS. I don't need to explain why.Things I didn't really like: The movie was VERY LONG and not good long either. I found myself bored at times.There were many scenes that could've been shortened. The plot to this movie was a mess. Less than the second film but but more confusing than the third. But I'll be honest, I don't care about the plot when there are giant transforming robots beating the crap out of each other.There's a lot of slow motion in this movie. There were times were I thought, ""Is this really necessary?"". Oh and my biggest complaint.. Michael Bay you let down with the dinobots man.. Now they were very cool and awesome to look at and everything, but they're only in the movie for so little and they arrive towards the end. There wasn't really a back story to them either other than the fact that they are ""legendary warriors"". Also, too much dinomode, not enough robot mode. They don't even talk!!!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
776,emiolabanwo,A spectacular mess of a movie difficult to stomach,2,27 June 2014,"A montage of overused Michael Bay-style shots combined with a lazy story and uninspiring acting - even from the talented Stanley Tucci - were not the worst reasons that the latest installment in the Transformers series was a chore to watch.It was as if the story was hot-potatoed by 12 different writers in a relay race on three different teams. The plot again tried to make it easy to relate to a movie about Alien-Robots by centering it on a family with the first world problems involved in the growing up of an adolescent. The only things that differentiated this movie from a TV sitcom were the clearly forced set locations, slow-motion action sequences,technologically fallacious babbling, ubiquitous ad placement, and catch- phrasey dialog. All mentally taxing and disrespectful to even the average enthusiast of movies.The almost three hour long movie was so uninteresting that I was not bothered by the 4 year old next to me literally jumping in his seat before the kiddo fell asleep with boredom. That's quite the achievement by a movie about Transforming-Robot-Dinosaur-Alien-Assassins. The collective Face-palms, and Teeth sucking of the theater audience was an indicator that the movie was unfavorable.Oh my word, that was a terrible! I hope I never again have to endure such a movie in my lifetime. Such torture should be against the Geneva conventions!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
777,netdomain,Long Boring & Wasted 3 Hours!,3,29 June 2014,"It was good for first one hour and after that I couldn't help yawning and falling asleep. The characters were shallow making stupid jokes. I kept thinking through the whole movie why I wasted my time and money on this. The only thing I could think of ""How much money did the producer waste on all this destruction and movie effects"". In some scenes I could see the BIG transformers fighting TINY human beings.... Come on! If we could fight those big creates with just a gun, all of us would be super heroes.I really miss watching movies where 3 hours would seem like 3 minutes!I would give it +8 for the effects and -6 for the story line and shallow characters, with total score of 6 out of 10!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
778,jack-guthrie,Horrible,1,21 July 2014,"This is by far the worst movie to have come out in 2014. It is absolutely terrible. Michael Bay has well and truly out Michael Bay'ed himself by combining his no storyline approach, horrible actors / characters, and over-the-top, excessive CGI. Years from now, Kelsey Grammar will be asked as to what he believes is his worst achievement in his career and he will answer Transformers 4: Age of Extinction. I would rather watch paint dry or my grandmother floss her dentures than watch this movie ever again. I do not understand why people continue to see these movies, they are financially rewarding Michael Bay for making dreadful movies, and - in turn - backing the creation of more atrocious films in this horrendous series.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
779,solomon-nomolos,Micheal Bay doesn't get away this time,1,20 September 2014,"Transformers 4 is a three hour auto programmed, templatized mashup of metal noises. The usual CIA vs civilians drama and the addition of dinosaur transformers, man made transformers, bounty hunter transformers, and dog transformers don't help you stay focused esp. since there isn't much to stay focused.Product placement was at its ""prime"" and so were the pointless dialogues. The plot is between weak and non-existent and the movie is needlessly long e.g when the autobots g to China, you don't need a shot of them flying over the great wall of China - we get it Mr. Bay.Its the kind of movie that you keep running on the living room TV when you are in the kitchen, just for the ambient noise!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
780,onatsahin,There is an Improvement and We Must Appreciate It,6,30 June 2014,"Like everyone I had complains about the last two movies but with this one I disagree with all the reviews. Everyone must stop over hating Bay and try to find some enjoyable things in this movie. Surely it had flaws but overall it was an enjoyable experience.Let's get this clear: Humans in this film are way better than Shia LeBeouf and his girlfriend that just happens to be there without any reason. Mark Wahlberg's character does a great job and he isn't useless and takes action. He is overprotective with his daughter. I'm glad that in the second half he stopped talking about how she shouldn't have a boyfriend because it was just starting to get annoying. But real annoyance in this movie is Stanley Tucci's character. He becomes really annoying in the second half. He is my biggest complaint in this movie.Storywise, I think this movie had a good one. Definitely better than the other Transformers movies. It takes place 5 years after dark of the moon. After that battle, humans don't want Transformers in Earth anymore and they hunt them. Because of this, remaining Autobots have to hide. I think they did a great job in attitudes of Autobots because even Optimus is angry now. He rages at humans which makes him more bad ass. They say this is out of Optimus' character but he saved humans 3 times and he is being hunted now. We just can't expect him to say ''Hey you are just simply evil but I'm not angry with you because there is more than meets the eye in you.'' This made Optimus far more realistic in my opinion. Also the other Autobots have personalities now which is great and Lockdown was hands down the best villain in this movie franchise. I wish they give Decepticons personalities because it is lacking. Also as shown in the trailers humans try to make transformers now and this was a good edition too. It was simply Humans vs Autobots which is a fresh concept.The action was great and it wasn't as brain hurting as dark of the moon which I liked. It had breaks it wasn't just explosions for 2 hours. The only bad part of action was human action. It wasn't as much as dark of the moon but it should have been shorter considering the movie was too long.And the Dinobots. It was simply great when Optimus rode Grimlock into the battle. It was the climax of the movie. After that movie just felt long. I wish Dinobots talked but probably we will see them in the next movie as well.I think you should go and see this movie yourself. If you want to like this movie, just ignore all the ''don't see it!!'' reviews. It was a fun action movie and enjoyable 3 hours. I would give this one a 7,5 out of 10 but unfortunately I don't have that option so I'm giving 8 out of 10 to increase this movie's unfair rating.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
781,victortexas,Why 6.3 and rest of the hate? This movie is actually really good!,8,15 July 2014,"Yes the movie is long, and kinda cheesy, but yet this movie still has tons of action, comedic moments, has some actual good parts, good acting, good plot, interesting dialogue, fun moments, not too many sexual themes or some racist things (which both I obviously don't either care), and a lot of satisfying and interesting moments. The characters are really well done, the characters are also as really done too, the villains (both evil transformers and humans) have done really, I do like the name ""Transformium"", the Dinobots may can't talk (maybe in future sequels), but still looked awesome, and had done some best moments, the soundtrack is great, I don't mind if Optimus Prime kills some evil humans, and I don't care if it had some logic issues. To me, Transformers: AOE is actually still much better than ROTF and DOTM. So yeah, I'm giving it an 8.2 or 8.5 for this movie. It's okay that if you still don't like it (Well kinda to me). Maybe in the future, hopefully that Transformers 5 and 6, they'll be even more better. I'm not saying that I hate Michael Bay or Ehren Kruger, I'm just saying that I think Michael Bay should take a break and start working on something else for the movie, and find a perfect director (or two). Either Kruger can do it right by himself only, have some old and/or new good writers, or just find a new perfect writer for the movie. That's all for now, and this all my opinion.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
782,Sven-Rosendahl,"too many flat characters with no depth, really bad plot and way too long",3,26 July 2014,"This movie made so many mistakes..Bay's first Transformers-movie was great,and I loved it - I loved the plot and the action scenes.To start with the positive aspects of the movie, the CGI and the fights were great. Explosions everywhere, a really hot blonde female and a Transformer-machine riding a T-Rex while wielding a sword. Great.The plot was horrible, but the characters were so badly written. They had absolutely no depth, the acting was not memorable as well and I hated that they played with stereotypes that much. There was this blonde 17-years old daughter of the main character,and during the first 30 minutes the meaning of the character was to allow others to reduce her to her looks - and it was so obvious.I'm really pis***about the movie,go and waste 3 hours of your life watching a really bad plot that never ends. But if you like to see a really stupid movie just for seeing explosions and machines destroying the whole city - you will love it.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
783,rishabgp,Where's my money!,1,30 June 2014,"Horrifyingly bad effects,poor story,extremely stupid plot holes and horrible characters(except Optimus prime and Bumblebee)make a very very very bad movie.The movie is incredibly long(2 and a half hours of a Michael Bay movie is just not cool).The story telling is absolutely retarded and another huge mistake was to focus on the humans instead of the auto-bots I mean why would you focus on humans when you have huge robots.The effects are really bad for example when they're transforming it looks like the graphics of the PS2.The Dinobots that are highlighted in the trailer do absolutely nothing and they don't even say out Grimlock's name or any of the other bots names and the main purpose of them is just to be driven by the auto-bots which is horrible.Don't waste your money on this nonsensical trash.NUFF SAID!!!",Transformers - Age of Extinction

785,Tdsaber,Innovation or failure?,8,12 August 2014,"I should say this before I give my review, I believe all the hate and all the love I get from the fans are all correct. The movie features totally different mood from the previous movies and it's noticeable from the very beginning. This difference became obvious to me since the direction of the series changed drastically. The movie had shown tremendous influence from comic book writers James Roberts / More than Meets the Eye and Simon Furman / Transformers Escalation. As the fans might acknowledge, these comic book series tend carry darker elements than it's expected from Transformers. In fact for such dark, serious and mysterious elements the stories stood out greatly. Bay used such elements appropriately. The world is not black and white. The story isn't just about humans and Transformers, and apparently there are greater forces in work. Finally a movie in years that avoids clichés. So a thumbs up for that. Like in noted comic books, we got to see distinct and unique characters. Of course they lack the charm that made me miss the old characters like Ironhide but they carried exclusiveness. Like the movie, the characters were not simply black and white. They're all not that good and royal as any Autobot should be. Crosshairs is a bossy arrogant opportunitist . Drift is a paranoid vigilant samurai, which has nothing to do with the original Drift, my least favorite character. Hound acts exactly as Bulkhead in Transformers Prime Series, the most loyal to Optimus, but not necessarily to others. Even Optimus doesn't act like his old self, since he's under constant pressure. And Bee, well I never liked Bay's version of Bumblebee, so I can't say much about him. I believe people like him and I leave it this way. I kinda like the introduction of Dinobots. They're almighty and legendary. They hold different loyalty and stand in the chain of command power. For the duration of the movie, I must agree and say ""Yes, it was long and boring"". Well it became like that exactly after the first half of the movie passed. There are a lot of long and unnecessary scenes that could have been easy removed without harming the story. So viewers should expect total new expectations or no expectation at all, if they want to understand and enjoy the movie.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
786,yothatshizzle,"Same movie, but done better.",5,2 July 2014,"I liked it. Yeah, it's basically the same movie as its precursors, but at least it was cleaner. I have never cared for unnecessary language or sexual content, and this one didn't have as much as the others, so I think that has it going for it. Especially in a franchise like this, based on children's toys. Kids are obviously going to see these, and I would advise them to not see Revenge of the Fallen. But again, this one was better.I also thought the action was cooler. In Dark of the Moon it was neat, but it got a little bland. Especially with the soldiers and Shia Labarf falling through the falling sky-scraper. Here we had frigging Dino-bots. That was just cool.Sure the story could have been developed more, but at this point I watch these for the Rock'em-Sock'em robot action. Its purpose is to be cool. I don't care if in these movies the story is pointless, so long as I see more robots than useless humans griping about the same things. To quote Nick Fury from Captain America: The Winter Soldier, I take this franchise for what it is, not as I'd like it to be.Plus, the way they set up for the fifth installment I think paves the way for the best Transformers movie yet. Optimus flying through space to find those who would have a bounty hunter just bring him there, claiming ""I'm coming for you"", while a little cliché, is still pretty cool. I expect more Cybertron story than human story in that one.I loved Galvatron, although his screen time was brief. He was a nice tribute to the classic story, and even though they didn't even mention the name Unicron (which was good, they shouldn't rush it), I expect him to be in the next one.I think this franchise gets a bad rep. Sure, they're not the best, but come on. It's Michael Bay. You watch his stuff to see it blow up. We should know by now what these movies are and shouldn't be surprised at them anymore.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Very surprised to see the dinobots and the creation of the human made transformers and very happy to see new robots and voice actors added into the cast. Also very surprised to see the movie look back towards the history of the Transformers by featuring the dinobots.

788,guppiesking,Don't waste your time!,3,3 October 2014,"This movie is filled to the top with discontinuity, bad acting, an absolutely disgusting lack of character development and a plot that seemed to have been written by a five-year-old. It consistently delivered repetitive action scenes; where there wasn't action, it was like watching paint drying. This was punctuated only by the occasional attempt at humor, fished from the old cliché barrel by the very same five-year-old. The movie's soundtrack was also repetitive, 90% of which was made up of explosions. The other 10% was the sound of car engines revving. The action scenes, which made up most of the movie, seemed blatantly unrealistic. Rockets that, on one hand, launched transformers hundreds of feet into the air barely caused our human heroes to stumble. In TF4, the only redeeming element was the GCI (just barely). Even this looked sketchy at times- for example, when the flying dinosaur catches Bee. This is the only reason the movie was successful in the least. To finish up, here is a quote from one of the top critics: ""I think 'Age of Extinction' is amazing fortune telling by the producers! it sums up perfectly where this film is going to end up. However did they guess?""I'm wondering the same thing",Transformers - Age of Extinction
789,cbg12494,Michael Bay did not Direct this,5,27 June 2014,"I typically try to have an optimistic view when it comes to film... but I'm going to be honest I have little to no respect for Michael Bay. He defiles ideas from classic and iconic children's toys and TV shows, hires crappy writers, casts attractive women with little to no acting ability and allows 90% of his films to be made by computers. I want to enjoy transformers because I grew up watching it and Im not saying the new one was terrible, but when you work with the same formula for every single movie you make you don't deserve the title of director. I enjoyed the new transformers but as a person who studies film and not just the artsy film garbage that ""connoisseurs"" consider classy, I am more upset and angered that he gets to be considered a director. He's a disgrace to the practice and the art that is film. I enjoyed all four transformers movies but Michael Bay did not make those films Hasbro and extremely talented computer designers did.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

No idea what Michael Bay was thinking! Bad plot/storyline OTT - even tho the CGI was pretty impressive. Too much going on all at one time - messy.They should have left it at the 3rd movie.

793,aj_67846,Look at it from a different point of view,6,28 June 2014,"First off, I want to say that by now people should know that a Michael Bay movie is not going to be a mind-blowing story. You're here for amazing action sequences. If you've seen or at the very least even heard about the past movies you should know this by now, so stop comparing him to James Cameron and quit complaining about the story because you already know whats in store. That being said, this movie is on par with the first one back in 2007, and way better than Revenge of the Fallen and may even surpass Dark of The Moon. The CGI is incredible. It has come a long way even from the 3rd movie. The action is great, just what you would expect from a MB film. What everybody is complaining about is that the story lacks. Yes it does. But people need to stop being pessimists and start seeing the glass half full. The story is a lot more intricate than any of the other movies.I can't go into detail, but the plot really flows and fits together, albeit after a little thought is put into it. Forget the fact that it's Michael Bay or what's his name Ehren Kruger. The story is good. They really went all out. The funny moments don't feel as forced as they previously did, and let me just stress how much better the father-daughter idea fits than the boyfriend-girlfriend. Everyone plays an important role and has something to contribute to the plot. There were plenty moments where I thought, wow that makes sense. Especially with the dinobots. I love how they are delving more into the world of the Transformers, finally addressing ideas that a person would have. I must say as well Age of Extinction was definitely more emotional than the past three films, but in a good way. And, this time they really set it up for future installments quite beautifully.My absolute favorite part is how this time, every robot gets the proper amount of screen time,with the exception of a few, and they all actually have meaningful dialogue. The transformers are finally getting some character development.The few bots that don't have much screen time I'm completely OK with.As I said before, they did a great job setting up for the next film and those few characters who needed a bit more of the spotlight will definitely be back. The one thing I do see wrong with this film is that despite being nearly three hours, the plot is so much more involved that everything happens really fast and it does get a bit hard to follow. If you're a true fan however, putting in some thought won't kill you.I said it before, and I'll say it again. You're not here for the plot, you're here for some amazing eye candy and a plot that is barely there. Boy does it deliver, not just in what you see, but the plot is an improvement. You would be making a mistake by not seeing this movie. You don't have to agree with me, but despite its flaws, Transformers Age of Extinction just may be the best in the series.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

795,russbond1,Autobots Regroup,10,12 July 2014,"In a word...EPIC!!!!I will start by saying that I have now seen this film four times since its release, twice in 2D and twice in 3D. Initially, I didn't know what to expect, the previous two instalments had been fairly disappointing, and I am getting older and with age you start to bow to the social pressures and stigma of liking action films. For a lot of people the Transformers franchise is the poster child for all that is wrong with modern cinema. I know it is a long way down from that particular pedestal but people ought to stop analysing films as if they are applying for a job as professional film critic. It is just plain ridiculous. I myself like all kinds of films and I judge them on their own merits, not, as I wish to be seen or judged...I still go to see films for the enjoyment I get from the individual film, whether it is Dhoom 3, Under the Skin or Transformers...they all offer something different...but I digress...'Transformers: Age of Extinction' is easily the best of the franchise so far and it has a lot to offer those that want to be entertained...if that is not you then stand well clear. If, however, you are a fan of the action genre and would like to see an action packed film that builds along a clear and concise narrative then this films is the film for you. The film is close to three hours in length but despite this the pacing is phenomenal; and the actors really do tie this film together...and none of them overstay their welcome. There are some topnotch performances from Kelsey Grammar, Stanley Tucci, James Bachman and of course Mark Wahlberg. In addition to this, the slightly younger and dare I say it more vacuous members of the cast are more than tolerable, and actually bring more to there roles than you might at first expect. I'm going to state with little remorse...Michael Bay's films have the best cinematography in modern cinema. He might never get the recognition he deserves, but what he does with ease within a single frame would take most other directors an entire lifetime to emulate. Critics often crave substance over style, but substance can be achieved through using good actors, style on the other hand is much harder to forge...and Michael Bay is smelting Mt. Doom. His style is effortless, yet it takes so much effort to achieve. Transformers Age of Extinction is the epitome of all of his efforts, and it really shows.

It is highly recommended for anyone with an ongoing affinity for action films.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
796,faizriaz,Brilliant movie Beautifully executed,10,7 July 2014,"A brilliant movie, Michael Bay again proved himself as he is from another world, Mark Whalberg was brilliant and portrayed his comic as well as his serious side wonderfully, CGI was great and not too mention the 3D experience, story line was aright although it could have been much emotional, the creator part in the story line picks the whole thing up as we can expect more Transformers from Micheal Bay and the whole concept of transformers having creators and all just push my adrenaline high, Last but not the least the movie itself keeps you hanging to your seat until the last scene because of it's action and firmness and continuity.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
797,maracaipe1098,Save money. Watch on cable.,1,5 July 2014,"This movie is basically the worst i ever watch in a long time. I liked the other 3 movies, but this is full of messy battles and explosions (Michael Bay's signature). Almost 3 hours of a completely forgettable history. Full of clichés, non-sense phrases and 'milk-and-water' jokes. The best parts of this, are the hot girls, messy but full of explosion battles, cars racing, and finally: the end. The history is out of nexus, example: When Shane (Tessa's boyfriend) is positioned on the field waiting they come to run. We don't know how he came so fast, and know that they are in danger.Don't spent money or time with this movie, please. You can wait for Cable or anything else.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
798,alex03122008,Yikes.......,5,28 June 2014,"Michael Bay has a wonderful tendency to take things that are dear to our childhood and crush them into oblivion with over use of cgi and action scenes. This movie has both in spades. I felt like my brain was fried after sitting through what felt like an eternity watching this thing. The movie was entirely too long. I had to catch my self several times from drifting off in to la la land during the bazillion fire explosion actions scenes. 2 of my 3 kids gave out on me at 2 hours and were caught snoring. 1 made it all the way through though? The movie actually started out with some promise. It seemed like it was going be funny with the back and forth banter between T.J. Miller and Mark Wahlberg...............then of course what does Michael Bay do? Kill off the funny guy about 14 minutes in for no particular reason at all. Aside from the obvious fact that Mark Wahlberg looks like he would probably be hitting on the girl who plays his daughter in the movie, who is dating a race car driver thats 20 years old (she is a minor mind you).

(I feel asleep at the theatre for a good 15 minutes, now that's not quite a waste of time, huh?)And... there's not much to describe, really.

But this series has gotten worse since the first film and this the point that we are at.Now my rant-There was no connection with the sub-characters in this film and I feel they didn't bring anything to main story they may as well not have being there.I didn't feel there was no explanation about who Lock-down was and also the robots that support Galvatron when in China as well just mindless clowns like in films 2 and 3.I felt that the way both Galvatron and Dinobots were poorly introduced when they are such huge characters in the transformers universe and deserve more of the story-line.Actions Scenes and in car chases were very samey and I feel that there was too much of this to make up for the paper thin plot.The back story of transformimum rubbish completely out of context with the Transformers universe.When I watched the first film and being a childhood fan of transformers I had high hopes of a great franchise, Apart from some small issues in first film there was great potential but after watching this tonight I have being completely crushed and I am very disappointed as this is very much now a ruined franchise.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

They knew it to be a flop and rejected the script.What possessed you producers to rid the 4th installment of the main characters?

804,alvinmrobles,One of the worst movies i've seen in a long time,1,28 June 2014,"Ahhh where to start. I usually don't write reviews. But yesterday's disappointment in watching this had to be expressed either through punching an anvil, or writing this review. But i need my hands this week so I'm going to write a review.I am a fan of transformers, i loved the cartoon series and the first and second blockbuster hit. I saw quite a substantial amount of plot holes in the third installation and I knew it was going to go downhill from there. I had hopes that the age of extinction would clear some of the plot holes i saw from the dark of the moon, and after seeing the movie trailers I became somewhat excited and felt all warm inside.I brought my two boys with me, bought some overpriced pop-corns and sugar drinks to stimulate my mind so that my brain could focus and absorb the new concept of the story, hoping to satisfy my hunger for unanswered questions that left my joy decimated at the last series.I like Walhberg during action scenes, but not when he starts making lame dialogues. And those lame dialogues deviate from being a bit funny, to just stab me in my thighs, depending on who wrote the script. Lame dialogues pervaded the whole friggen movie! There are countless, pointless, perpetually boring ass things that prevented the story, or just the movie as a whole from being appreciated. The characters were annoying, namely Lucas, Tessa and that friggen Shane who is nothing but a disrespectful little sh*t to Walhberg and exhibited this attitude throughout until third quarter of the movie. I'm a dad alright, and I just wanted to punch him the f**k out! And Walhberg should've done the same, what the hell? Few good actors, but the characters were weak. Every time i thought that the movie was trying to make people laugh, I look around the entire cinema and see people staring at the screen, not laughing. I look at my boys and they're not laughing, and they're the type that laugh at anything that moves. I'm not laughing because my mind is struggling trying to keep that hope alive while at the same time enduring the thought of another ominous outcome, ""when is this going to end?"", ""stop doing stupid things"", ""stop trying to make me laugh"", ""just stop talking"", ""OMG what am I doing here?""I finish the giant popcorn and my big tub of sugar drink after an hour. I thought that if i just go out for a smoke, maybe i'll be able to appreciate the rest of the movie because my mind will be refreshed. I'll take my time, maybe say hi to that nice ticket collector and make small talk. That's 10 minutes to recuperate. It couldn't be that bad.I get back to my seat. Nothing changes... Every new main event that was introduced in the movie was not properly explained in the end. In other words, it just came out of nowhere and went nowhere. This just piled up leaving me with more and more questions. It seems as if plots were inserted in holes and the viewer was left to create his own resolution of it. The story is incongruently incoherent. Why after all this time, can't Bumblebee talk? With all the autonomous robotic, high alien-technologically advanced race systems that are available that they can't rectify his voice box?? I wanted to see more of the dinobots. And why were they in the... never mind, no spoilers.Yes most of the action scenes were great, but come on, don't make it lame by adding something that doesn't belong there, like another horrific comment, phrase or something that isn't funny. It destroys the entertainment. In fact, just don't even talk during the action scenes please!Graphics are awesome. That's the only thing I appreciate. So unfortunately i left disappointed once again. More than disappointed, irritated and frustrated. I asked my boys what they thought, they said ""ummm... awesome?"" as if that definition has lost it's meaning and they weren't entirely sure how to make me feel better. I wanted to research on the writers and directors who created this movie to try and figure out how they defiled a great science fiction theme, but I couldn't give a cross-bun anymore. I'll let it roll this time. I feeling a bit better now.In the end i figure this movie suits those who don't care too much about story lines and great characters and dialogues. Mainly those who like to see giant robots fight. but the movie is rated for matured audiences and robot fights only took place during half the movie. So then I question what are the creators of this film trying to achieve? Use the name for profit and create something primarily for entertainment purposes. But today's audience are rational thinkers who want more than just action scenes and loud explosions. So...",Transformers - Age of Extinction
805,danielfisher1980,It's hard to describe just how bad this is.,2,29 June 2014,"I need to preface this with - I'm a fan of the first three Transformers movies. So don't think this review is coming from a hater of the series. It's coming from someone who is genuinely disappointed at the massacre of this franchise as we know it.This movie actually started reasonably well enough, a little bash and crash Transformer action, mixed with some cool scenery ..... though after 10 minutes you start thinking to yourself ..... ""Did I miss an entire movie in this saga?"" ..... ""Why is this happening?"" ..... ""What was Michael Bay thinking?""The entire plot is sketchy at best, non-existent at worst. It's been 5 years since the Chicago attacks (Dark of the Moon) and we're pushed into an unexplained weirdo deal with a random Transformer'ish type creature who has come from somewhere unexplained to grab Optimus and the other Autobots to lock them in a weird, not-to-scale flying jail spaceship with slimy spider aliens and other universe scum. In return for helping him, we humans get a bomb to turn organic matter into metal so we can harvest more ""Transformium"". Yes ""Transformium"", as stupid as it sounds. We now know how to make Transformers did you know? Though we might have accidentally recreated Megatron and given him a soul so now he's back alive and going to try for some more global destruction and hijinx .... seriously what the hell?? Where did this come from?? Who thought up this rubbish?There's a new Samurai Autobot, along with a wrecker-type Autobot. Apparently best mates with Optimus and Bumble-Bee, but seriously again Michael Bay .... what the hell? We've never seen these guys before and it's painful listening to the over-Asian accent on the Samurai. Why? Why? Why? These new additions also feed the ""Did I miss an entire movie"" way of thinking? Seriously did Michael Bay release this movie in the wrong order? Is there something else that was meant to come out first?The acting is woeful. Usually you expect a little awkward, though well delivered comedy from Transformers, though with Mark Wahlberg and Jack Reynor it's just way too awkward. It's contrived. It's weird. Kelsey Grammar - terrible. Titus Welliver - terrible. Sophia Myles & Bingbing Li - why are they even in this movie? Nicola Peltz - painful. These actors have all had note-worthy performances before, but maybe they all signed up before they even read the script? That's the only explanation I can think of.Even the SFX which Michael Bay surely couldn't mess up are terrible. Everything's happening too fast, weirdly shaking camera when you just want them still so you can see what's happening. Also ... when was the Great Wall of China in the nearby vicinity of Hong Kong? This movie is rubbish. For hardcore Transformers fans I'd recommend waiting for Blu-Ray, hiring it, putting it in the Blu-Ray player, hitting play, then leaving the house and going for a walk for 2 hours and 45 minutes .... yes that's right 165 minutes of pure nonsense.The first movie I've wanted to walk out on in a long time.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
806,nihalkashyap,A pretty Good Comeback!,8,11 October 2014,"One word...Awesome!!! Michael Bay the director of the Transfomer series talked about the latest franchise of the movie which released on the 27th of June this year (2014). Transfomers: age of extinction...apparently the best title they could choose for the movie. Michael Bay talked about his upcoming movie in an interview before the films release...he talked about how it it tough to make a fourth film after a trilogy with the same characters and cast (For Humans). This was the best thing he did. No offence, but Shia Labeouf who acted as the main character in the trilogy of the series would not be a very good option for this story...Transfomers Revenge of the fallen (2) and Transfomers Dark Of the Moon (3) were super-hit films or maybe blockbusters or something but the story or the plot wasn't pretty good. The animations, VFX, special effects and other tech things in the 2nd movie were very realistic but in the third movie there wasn't a good story nor good animations and VFX and other stuff. The first movie and this one (the fourth) are the best movies according to me from this series and you must watch both of them. For the first time i found a good story in sci-fi fiction film...but a few raters and haters or maybe critics have given it bad ratings...but according to me, all the hard work, passion to do something new, unique deserves something good, and so i would rate it 8/10.

I was laughing my butt off at bumblebee and the comedy he and the other characters provided. And everyone hates on imagine dragons for doing the song for transformers instead of linkin park. Linkin park was busy. Otherwise they would have.. and I was a tad skeptical about it too but it was a brilliant song that fit right in to the movie. I didn't want it to end.

812,dengjingyuan,"awful film, predictable plot, pointless effects",2,4 July 2014,"This is definitely one of the worst films i have ever seen. To start with, i should say that i was transformer fan and used to read the Marvel comics. However i almost dozed off in the middle of the film and the only reason i didn't was that the film kept booming all the way through. I cannot stand the tedious plot- if there ever was a meaningful plot- from the beginning, almost. When the monologue of the CIA officer started, you basically got a clue what was going to happen: a new villain comes, cooperating with some secret government divisions and almost defeating Optimus, and Optimus finds some new fancy magic to kill the villain. And sadly as it turned out that the guess was right for the most part. The film is full of slow motions that proved to be unnecessary and time-wasting, and CG effects that proved to be pointless when there is no plot. What is the point of special effects after all? To serve the story and create visual impact of course. But haven't we seen many films with those explosions and fighting before? This is not 1980s when the special effects are so groundbreaking that people all went to watch Star Wars for the new effects. The CG effects in films cannot be seen and treated as an END, but a MEANS. Surely CGs can be an end, but only to programmers perhaps, definitely not to audiences. Yeah I know you can make Optimus riding a dinosaur but so what? Bay understood this the whole other way around: the point of the plot seems to be creating more opportunities to present all the CG effects. The characters, both human and alien, were poorly created. The transformers from the first film of the series seemed to be made for fighting and had no culture or society of their own. Any fantasy or science-fiction film should at least explain a little bit about that or otherwise those fighting machines do not seem to be realistic. There was NEVER a complex plot happening amongst the transformers, which, ironically, the comics did an excellent job in. The only transformer character in whom some efforts were put into is Optimus, who nonetheless appears as a fighting machine, more so than Megatron in the comics, and lacks proper leadership and sophisticated mind. He does not seem to be charismatic and the only reason he was the leader seems to be that he is a greater FIGHTER than anyone else. Where is the prudent and messianic Optimus? Where is the lovable bumblebee? Most of the human characters can simply be eliminated from the film and no different will be made. And I still don't understand why Wahlberg's character keeps finding troubles for himself and his daughter even though they are safely out from the fight. Tucci's character is simply moved by an ambiguous call from Wahlberg and changes all his plans and thoughts, too gullible to be believed as realistic. The CIA officer actually can be used to create a moral dilemma in which people have to choose between the safety of their own and abandonment of the faithful allies and of course that didn't happen. I saw no romance between the lovers. Going through some escapes doesn't mean two people automatically love each other. There are lots of screaming of the two though, but doesn't seem like romance to me. The protective dad enjoys dragging his daughter and her boyfriend into troubles which he has no reason to concern.

Ppl just watch all this bs and oh, they even like it...I'm not sure what causes the phenomenon of movies getting worse all the time. There might be the following reasons: - people get attracted more to trash and since Hollywood is an industry, they want to make as much money as possible and produce crap movies because they sell better than some intellectual movies. - writers and directors get worse every year. - the film industry invests more on new technology (like 3D) than in a good story and acting skills. - all of the aboveWHAT HAPPENED TO QUALITY FILMS???Going to kill myself now.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

The writing for this movie is so bad it makes me legitimately depressed. Nothing makes sense, characters are stupid and say stupid things (""I like to be fresh when I'm making out with your daughter""), and the product placement is so blatant it's almost insulting. For example, in one scene Mark Wahlberg's character is standing on the street and the ground is covered with bud light bottles. Marky Mark then picks up one of the bottles, breaks it on a mans car, and takes a sip. The only thing keeping this from a 1 is Stanley Tucci, who has a handful of chuckle worthy lines.

Most squeal's or whatever usually continue on with the storyline but this didn't really continue on from the battle of Chicago in Transformers 3. They only kept 3 of the characters from the original movies and changed the structure of the movie. The last two had more of a build up to the final battle. It did get somewhat towards the end. I think Mark Wahlberg played a very good part in it. If they kept the original characters and kept more to the original story line and made it more of a continuation then it'd probably be a better movie. People are complaining about how bad it is but personally if your a transformers fan then it's still a must see.

818,xanite,A very funny movie,6,7 October 2014,"A great action movie! The only helplessly annoying thing in this movie is blondie if I may. But she is sweet and as for the ""American heaviness"" of the whole thing, this is Transformers, so expect some 'Merican grandeur! The best Transformers movie from my point of view.Scenario has nothing genius but that's what's good to it. You want there to be giant badass robots who speak with Morpheus' voice (amazing job on the voices and sound by the way), explosions, spacecrafts, building-sized spades and weapons, huge shiny 'Merican trucks, fire-spitting dragons and bad jokes... and all you get is... wait... oh yeah you get all this in one movie! So an efficient scenario is all you can wish for.I liked the first Transformers movie for the whole new package of special effects it brought with itself. But honestly, the first three movies had something boring in them. This fourth movie is a technical piece of art + Mark Wahlberg ans Stanley Tucci make the acting part real fun from a comedy perspective, as well as the Chinese assistant who, you've got to admit in the end, is awesome. Additionally, the Bumblebee from this opus is way...way groovier than the poor dog we see in the third movie. This one definitely has an attitude and is a grown young guy with a big heart in contrast with the pitiful puppy from the previous production.To this I'd like to add that the scenes shot in Hong Kong, Guangzhou and Beijing are all good and some of them were just so true, they reminded me the time I spent there (especially the scene where they bargain a motorbike in the middle of the street... :) ).Getting back to the whole special FX in there: Yes there is a ****load of everything, but don't get me wrong. Unlike in some of the previous movies where you could get confused when the scenes are framed in a not entirely satisfying way, all is under control here, all working out to put in place a truly funny experience for the spectator.In conclusion: I hope it is useless to mention you shouldn't expect a smart movie here, but just enjoy the stupid overload of 'Merican greatness and watch Mark Wahlberg having fun like any other kid in his position would :) If you had to watch only one of the four movies, pick this one.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
819,amanda-duncombe,"Despite the flaws, loved it!!",9,6 July 2014,"Having been a fan of the Transformers franchise since the G1 series back in the 80's, I've long come to the realisation that no one is ever going to do the original series justice, unless you count the animated movie from the same era... It's like trying to recreate your first love over and over which just doesn't work which is why I've always approached the live action films with the attitude of 'What the hell... just enjoy it for what it is'... and the newest installment is no different.Set five years on from 'Dark of the Moon', 'Age of Extinction' is almost a complete reboot of the series, obviously Optimus is still there as is Bumblebee (for which I am eternally grateful as the big yellow guy has always been my favourite), Ratchet also puts in a brief appearance but that doesn't end well!! So this means that there is a whole new cast of Autobots and Decepticons to become familiar with, as well as a new human family and characters. The majority of the human characters work well, there is less comedy than there was around the Witwicky family which fits well with the darker tone of the movie, though some of the dialogue is still a little cringe worthy. The new Autobots don't have the instant likability of those in the earlier films, but they are by no means awful. The Decepticons however get a rough deal, and have nowhere near the presence of those of the earlier films, and I for one am not keen on the way they are shown to transform, amazing as it looked in IMAX 3D. Lockdown however filled this gap and was a satisfying villain to the piece, as was the human character of Attinger. The Dinobots were also amazing but really needed much more screen time.All in all, I have to say I loved it. Yes the plot line suffered in places, and as I've said there were things that could have been improved, but if people just take it as it is then it's amazing, and if I come out of a cinema with my inner child (who is what started me on this journey all those years ago) doing cartwheels of excitement because I've just seen Optimus Prime riding on Grimlock on the big screen, then who am I to argue??!!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
820,mrsxxx0,If you like SciFi and special effects....,7,30 June 2014,"**Possibly contain some spoilers***Personally I enjoyed this movie, especially in IMAX 3D.There are a lot of ""ifs"" that goes with this movie. If you ultimately, love the Transformer series. If you absolutely love special effects. If you love action/adventure. If you don't mind LOUD and I do mean LOUD. If you don't long...this is the movie for you.Sure I got lost at a few parts, but I really didn't care: I was caught up in the effects in the movie. And I got back on track with the plot after a few minutes too. By the time the movie was over, I understood the plot...and I enjoyed the movie immensely. I think Mark Wahlburg and the rest of the crew did a good job in stepping in with the new characters, and I admired Mark's shooting skills with the alien gun. (that's all I'm going to say about that). It was a different out take with the Autobots being pro human, and can you really blame them? If you were being hunted down you wouldn't be too friendly or trustworthy with the enemy as well. And the Decepticons? Well Decepticons will be Decepticons. Lockout got what he deserved. And the Dinobots rocked (after I finally figured out what they were and where they came from).Over all, we laughed, gasped, ooh'd and ahh'd throughout the movie. We wondered where did that come from in several parts, but like I said it all came together.I enjoyed it. And I will make sure I go to the next one.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
821,liam-mcquade9000,Letdown,4,7 August 2014,"I have always been a Huge transformers fan but this one was a let down for me.Firstly, I have to say Mark Wahlberg's character Cade Yeager topped Shia LaBeouf's performance of Sam Witwicky by a long shot and was the best decision they ever made by replacing the main character!.1. There was too much human interaction in the film, even though mark's performance was exceptional, there was not enough action with the transformers and seemed like they spent most of the time just talking to each other 2. The idea of changing how the transformers actually transform made it unbelievable for me. Yes it is a Sci-fi film but this turned it into a magical film and not a robotics one. They need to keep the change from transformer to electrical appliance (car / van etc) the same and not have some mystical dots float through the air to create a robot.3. The last fight scene was awesome! and lasted for a good amount of time but that was the only decent one. they needed more slow motion shots and more intense weapon draw moments. we want fighting robots.. not listing to them talk for ages!4/10 for me.. hope i haven't added any spoilers",Transformers - Age of Extinction
822,joaniekensil,"Big Fan, but this one fell completely flat",2,1 July 2014,"I am so disappointed. The first Transformer movie was one of my favorite movies of all time. And I'm 55! And a woman! The 2nd and 3rd ones were at least entertaining with some funny lines. Whoever wrote this one just sucked at humor. Totally sucked. The lines that were supposed to be funny were just stupid. I was so glad to see the surfer dude exit the movie early on. The movie was WAY too long. I yawned twice. There is one scene where metal things are being sucked up and dropped back down. After about 10 minutes of this, Mark Wahlberg's character says ""It's like a giant magnet that is sucking things up and then dropping them down!"". Oh really, ya think? You finally figured that out Capt. Obvious? The lead actress was hired for the same reason the previous lead actress were. (Hint: It's not for acting skills). That, of course, was not a surprise. A lot more swearing in this one. Not for the little ones. I went with my two teenage sons. They liked one part. Where Rainbow Dash turned into a gun. The end was left wide open for a Transformers 5. I hope they get a different writer. Overall impression after watching is: My brain is tired.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
823,pesicvladimir,Not so good,5,20 September 2014,"The theme itself is processed through several, i must say, very successful film achievements.That the continuation of the story had some sort of chance in company of previous three films of the Transformers, story must be developed in a more comprehensive way and a more global influence of actors in the story must be present and of course culminating of the story that causing strong feelings of intense and comprehensive that permeate the viewer and lead him to ecstasy. Which unfortunately in this embodiment is not the case. Also, on the other hand, I think the actors did job as best they could, but considering that the script such as it is this criticisms is deserved. As well credit for the special effects,but all the other important aspects based on which a film achievement can be called successful, were missing.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
824,ibrahimtene,Yuck..,4,14 July 2014,"I was already skeptical when this title hits the theater, however, seeing as how a lot of my acquaintances actually like this movie, I decided to give it a go anyway. It was with a (somewhat forced) enthusiasm that I step into the theater that night. After all, I have quite a few reasons to be optimistic. First of all, there is a change in the casting. Shia Lebouf was out, in comes Mark Wahlberg. Shia was fresh and entertaining on the first movie, but just got downright annoying in the sequels. Second of all Dino transformers!! was anxious to see how they would incorporate that into the storyline. Once the movie starts however, there ends my enthusiasm. OK where do I start? The storyline is so weak and forced. I understand that this is a movie about transforming robots and aliens, but at least put a little bit of logic in to it?? Mark Wahlberg was...Mark Wahlberg..you could've inserted short clips of him from Italian Job and I wouldn't be able to tell the difference. The daughter character was insignificant, could've made the whole movie without her. In some point of the movie, the human-engineered autobots didn't go through all those intricate transforming animations, instead they just turn into some floating cubes before transforming into whatever vehicle they transform into. Personally, I think that the animators were just lazy at this point to create the animations and decided to go with the cube thing instead. Enclosing, weak storyline, too much CGI, bad casting, long storyline...wait until its on HBO guys",Transformers - Age of Extinction
825,bmahlstedt33,Autobots...Roll Out!,10,27 June 2014,"So here is the thing...these are not ""good"" movies by any means, the Transformers series is just pure entertainment and fun. Although Age of Extinction delivers on that trend of being very fun to watch, you have to get to that part of the movie, which is the last hour or so.The beginning starts off promising, with Cade (Marky Mark) leading the charge and being a likable hero. Hey I didn't even mind his daughter Tessa in the beginning, she was just a teenage girl going through those high school years. Sure the dialogue was cheesy, but I could understand the relationship that the two characters had with each other.Enter the mysterious truck, who turns out to be none other than our hero, Optimus Prime. With the discovery of Prime, we now have our bad guys enter the mix as well. Now Lockdown was probably one of my favorite parts of the movie. He was a pretty lethal baddie, who got right to the point. On the other hand, the human bad guys (CIA/Government) were just annoying. Yes they had a purpose in contracting with Lockdown and providing Stanley Tucci's character with the precious metal, but why not just bypass that and have Lockdown team up with Joyce (Tucci) instead.Anyway, the next forty-five minutes of the movie were just completely EH. The chase between the CIA and the humans/Optimus and Lockdown was well done, but once we have to listen to Cade and Tessa bickering about her boyfriend who shows up, I started to lose my interest. Thankfully that forty-five minutes ended with a decent bang, with Bumblebee and Crosshairs impressively flying through Chicago and Joyce coming to the realization that creating our own Transformers, wasn't the best idea.Now we get to the meat of the movie, which takes place in Hong Kong. As newly human-created Galvatron finally is revealed as SPOILER...Megatron in a new body, we have a full on battle for humanity looming. How do our old Autobot allies plan to save us this time? By releasing the highly anticipated Dinobots.Now for me personally, this last act of the movie was enough for me to say I enjoyed my time in the theater. Seeing Optimus charge on Grimlock, while Bumblebee fought his rival, Stinger, on top of a flying dinosaur robot was pure madness. But that is the type of madness we blockbuster fans want to see! Another reason that the last hour or so of the movie worked so well, was because the humans took the back seat and the title characters stole the show.In conclusion, I have to say that if you enjoyed the past movies, you will no doubt be happy with Age of Extinction. The visual effects of IMAX 3D were stunning and the sound literally shook the theater. I was a little disappointed that Steve Jablonsky decided to go with a completely different tone, because I adored the original scores so much, but hey what are you gonna do.Oh and one more thing, don't go in to this one hoping it feels like the last trilogy, because this movie has a completely different overall tone/feel.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

The first hour was plot driven and tolerable to watch. Wahlberg is always fun to watch and the main chick is cute but the last 1.5 hours is straight action and no plot and I wanted to walk out before I had a seizure.Special effects were visually pleasing, but would have been better if I cared what was going on. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a hater. I tried so hard to be interested in this flick but I found myself looking at my watch obsessively for the last hour.On the lighter side, the idea behind the plot was interesting and though provoking but poorly executed on screen.I have never written a review before, but this movie was so utterly disappointing that I felt obligated to warn humanity.

I was planning to watch it in IMAX theater with my cool 3D glasses, cause I felt it will be worth it to pay extra for movie that I grew up with, but I am glad that I did not do it. Frankly speaking, I did not pay much attention anymore to dialog and acting after like quarter of the movie, there are numbers of parts of the movie that can be developed more, and parts that can be shortened, especially parts that just to show how advance CGI is and what CGI can do these days.

Very bad.The plot went with the generic ""evil corporation / evil government conspiracy"" angle, which was a pretty poor call for a Transformers movie. The previous times they went that direction there was at least some humor in it. Not this time. One wonders what the 195 million Americans with cameras in their cell phones were doing while these guys were running around egregiously breaking the law in plain sight.Several new groups of Transformers appear out of basically nowhere to add little or nothing to the plot (deus ex transmachina?). Or what is intended to be the plot. Typical ""blow up the world yet again"" fare. {Spoiler: The world doesn't blow up, yet again.} The supposed ""hot female lead"" is like 12 and runs around in disturbingly little clothes screaming constantly, and the only hot adult female actresses (Sophia Myles and Bingbing Li) get zero air time.This movie gave me a headache.And did I mention that it was way too long?

As well as a good continuation from Dark of the Moon, it could also be seen as a stand alone film. It has a good plot, sad in parts though like the death of Ratchet. Also a few interesting plot twists. I for one was a fan of the maybe controversial Autobots seeking revenge for the humans hunting them down. Lockdown was also a great villain a lot like his Animated counter part, he is quite mysterious. And definitely the best of the new Autobots is hound, his wit and brutality are great. Also, the open ending leaves a few windows for more possible films in the series.

There's just not any words that I can find to convey just how terrible this movie is, let alone condense it into a summary. I'm sure many more eloquent people will have described just how bad it is so I will just list some points.i) Product placement at its absolute worst, disgusting. Advertisers, if you want to be part of ruining films and franchises then I will actively avoid any and all of your products.ii) Humour, really? Cheap one liners fill this film from start to end, it's so cringe worthy that you almost have to see it to believe it... almost. Terrible, it makes you want to root for the entire main cast to be taken out in some terrible explosion, which leads me on to...iii) Explosions, I thought Bay was supposed to be at least good at this? Pathetic seemingly random fireworks all over the place.iv) Far too much human influence at a small scale determining the outcome undermines the entire film. Advanced alien robots being taken out by small squishy humans that should have died numerous times, if not from weapons, by the sheer amount of shrapnel everywhere. Sick of the 'precious special human' sentiment that infects this film and others, this film should be primarily about Transformers with humans only playing a cameo role.v) Alien technology, so unbelievably badly thought out and messed up, it's absurd.I could go on but I shan't waste another minute on this, needless to say, don't bother going to see this, the less money it makes the better. I can only hope for a decent reboot sometime in the not too distant future.Michael Bay, you should be ashamed.

834,little-cena,Disappointment.,1,26 July 2014,"Transformers: Age of Extinction is a combination of cheesy scenes and countless/needless explosions, with too many sides taking on each other and a plot-line set far off from the first three original installments in the series. The movie would have faired far better with Shia LaBeouf (Samuel Witwicky) and John Turturro (Agent Seymour Simmons) cast instead. Additionally, the much anticipated Dinobots, are not as present as some might have liked. Their re-awakening is entirely absurd and will leave you with more questions than answers. Other things to note would be the absence of a Decepticons side. While one would speculate that the series is all about the Autobots versus the Decepticons, that would be not the case in this one.With that said, we don't get to know where Lockdown comes from, who he works for, or why he's there in the first place. Although, he may be the best and most badass character this franchise has ever seen.If you're a die-hard Transformers fan like myself, you're in for the disappointment of the series.

(Decepticons vs Autobots which is all about anyways) New addition in the Autobots casts ( Crosshair, Hound) was brilliant and brought fresh air! The quick action of the movie when Ratchet (One we thought would never die) actually dies was a chock and brought a good twist. Lockdown was an marvelous Antagonist for the movie. No allegiance to the humans nor deceptions nor autobots. And the fact he had his hook just like in the TV show was awesome made him feel more alive! Seeing Optimus Prime really weak made the story a hell lot better, made me thought of the Dark Convoy at some point. Explosions were OK I didn't mind them it was appropriate. Human part was OK to me Mark Whalberg brought something really new to the franchise: His touch of acting) and no his acting wasn't """"Horrible"""" as some seems to be saying BUT they love him in various others movies?

This movie introduces two new problems that make the movie interesting and engaging: the fight between the humans and the autobots, and the artificially-made Galvatron.

843,feefoo-mm,I don't understand how people aren't satisfied with this movie. (contains some spoilers),10,1 August 2014,"This contains lots of spoiler, so beware if you hate being spoiled about a movie you haven't watched yet. To be completely honest, I enjoyed every single bit of the movie and it's on my top favourite list of this year after the movie Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. Perhaps, it is because I am a fan of transformers movies since part one. And definitely, it's because people's opinions and points view do differ after all. So, it's absolutely something normal to see bad reviews and good ones. But for this movie's situation, I neither can understand nor fully digest at how most of the reviewers are going mad about it. Firstly, there's absolutely a plot going on in this movie. And this is Michale Bay's style in his creation of Transformers. So I don't get how most of people would say something like (there wasn't even a story to being with..). Well, I believe that the reason could possibly occur due to the fact that most people are raging about it since the original story itself had a different plot. (The original story indicating the cartoon one) But, so what? Bay had a different idea in his mind, and to be honest, it was not uninteresting and bad at all. If you're very disappointed about this fact, then why bother watch the movie from the start if you'll just keep judging it with the cartoon one?Secondly, the action is amazing. Beautifully made. The robots look very flawless. Optimus Prime looks stunning. And Bumblebee is definitely adorable. And especially the new army that helped them at the end of the battle, this idea took my breath away and I clapped at that part. The robotic dragoon was a classic in my opinion. The drama and harmony that goes in circle between the robot family is just heart warming. And now Let's face it, Transformer is definitely a Sci/Fi and Action sort of genre, isn't it? So, OF COURSE there will be lots of it. I mean, even the cartoon one had the same genre.. So, what's the difference here? Why'd they fuss about it? And why most of reviewers are making fun of it and saying something like (all that ever happened was action.) Hm, okay? To be honest, if someone said to me now: (yeah since too much action made me blind from seeing the drama.) I might even accept it since I'll understand from that point of view that this person wasn't even interested, and was already disappointed before even buying the ticket. Thirdly, the soundtracks were epic. Amazing choice of songs from good bands that are well known from today. What I like about Transformer is that they like to differ in their bands, they don't always stick to one band or the same bands for their music. They like to explore since they have an idea of the tendency of differences in many others that might suit the movie's behalf. They do stick to some bands that they like, but still, don't you realise they always have new bands and singers going along their OST? That's something I literally appreciate, and I believe it's one part of making a movie epic.Lastly, the new actors and actresses that were chosen were actually pretty good in their roles. Especially Cade. I loved his role the most, and I love the fact that he found Optimus Prime, and had created a warm bond with him. Their acting was satisfactory to me, and okay, I somehow agree with the humorous part in some scenes. But it wasn't that bad at all. In fact, I thought that some of them were really funny and enjoyable. Some people have humor like this, you don't always have to expect excellence in humorousness because other people have lame jokes too, and some others would laugh about it and appreciate it. Unfortunately, not most of us see that, right? And would just therefore judge.Anyway, in the end, I appreciated this movie not because I am a big fan of it, but because I totally think it was beautifully made. Thus, explains the 10 I've given. I strongly believe that Bay's effort was heartily given, and he made me respect his cleverness in his thing for explosions and actions once more. Therefore, it made me utterly sad to see people have hated it JUST because of such trifle matters. Again, I'm not saying this because I am a big fan of it. E.G. I used to be a big fan of The Vampire Diaries series. But not anymore, because it literally started to get boring and complicated. But the latest Transformers, wasn't complicated at ALL, and it still had the same storyline. So what is there to be complicate about. It's obvious if you TRULY observe and not go along with people who judge just in order to either ""fit in"" or go with the norm. And again, people's opinions do differ after all. So, who am I to also keep pointing out. Though I just wanted to explain all of this because I believe it's like an advice as well.So, my advice to you is, if you still haven't seen the movie, and you're having doubts about it since most reviews are bad, or YOU already have BAD thought about it since some others have persuaded you; still, give give it a try. Why not, right? What's to lose anyway? If YOU are confident that you can afford the ticket, and wouldn't mind, and wouldn't hate or rage about the money if you didn't like it, then go for it and see for yourself.

844,moviemaster18-968-687993,This movie was great! Forget what the critics say,8,25 July 2014,"This summer blockbuster with Transformers was awesome! The action scenes were cool and more comprehensible this time around. The plot is really good! To understand the plot; the viewer needs to focus and think about what the characters say. The government is involved again in this movie which really complicates the story, so a lot of attention is required. Yes there were minor plot holes but not enough to drop the grade of this movie.The acting was average. Tessa and her boyfriend acted poorly and are least interesting. But Mark Wahlberg performed well here. The auto bots this time have more character and are pretty likable and not ignored like the previous movies. The special effects and background visuals are sharper and look really great. The editing was well done too.The biggest cons of this movie is that it is too long(although not much difference from Revenge of the Fallen and Dark of the Moon) and the Dinobot's short screen time.Overall this movie is fun and a big improvement over the previous ones. I give this movie an 80% B or 4/5 stars. The critics have no understanding of this movie. Enjoy, pay attention, and eat your popcorn.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

You don't have to read the rest of my review, go watch the movie. What else could they want from this movie. There were location changes, beautiful cars, ha ha some product placement. lolI could not tell how long i was in the theater, it was captivating. The characters were good. There is a message for people about how we treat others, which can happen to us. Mark has a great body. The girl is beautiful, but her outfits were over the top. The effects were great, however 3d was OK. definitely an IMAX view.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
846,Nualls,You know the drill...,4,29 June 2014,"*SPOILER-FREE REVIEW*You know it's a Michael Bay Transformers movie, so despite what the trailers suggest, don't expect anything new... This movie is no exception and still contains the exact same drivel as the previous 3 movies.Where to begin? Well, this movie isn't all bad. The best thing about this movie is its recasting (aka Mark Wahlberg). Wahlberg's performance is grand and is honestly the best thing about this movie. Although Wahlberg's lines can be somewhat cheesy due to Michael Bay's unorthodox sense of humour, he manages to pull it off and as I've already stated, delivers a grand performance. As for the other main cast, I can really only say this... Nicole Peltz is a slight upgrade from Megan Fox (and 'blonde Megan Fox'). Jack Reynor is simply an unnecessary annoyance throughout the entire movie. What I've learnt about Michael Bay's Transformers movies thus far is that they display some of the best visuals of our time. The visuals due to special effects (by a team of workers whose names you will NEVER know) are simply stunning and I can now safely say that the visuals are really the only reason I continue to watch these movies.The bad? I'll save you a lot of time and give it to plain and simple. The plot is an absolute mess. The movies length is WAY TOO LONG. The pacing is sloppy... Wait, in fact, the plot isn't a mess, it's just f**king stupid, it's just stupid. The character's have no development and you're left not giving an flying f**k about any of them! THEY COULD HAVE KILLED OFF LITERALLY ANY MAIN CHARACTER AND YOU WOULD NOT GIVE A SINGLE F**K. Conclusion, you CAN enjoy this film, although you'll most likely be left somewhat disappointed due to Michael Bay's disgustingly awful story telling. Personally, I can't wait until the live-action Transformers movies get a reboot and are given a more serious director that can actually deliver a well-structured plot.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
847,LeviThompson,Better than expected,8,28 June 2014,"Even though the movie had no art in the film making, or Oscar winning acting; it was still full with classic Michael Bay explosions, slow motion, and hot girls. the movie, for me, was way better than i expected and was much better than all the other transformer movies. the annoying thing in this film was the amount of ad placements, they would pop up in the middle of an action scene and totally get me of track. but overall this movie was extremely entertaining and thats what your spending $10 for when you go to see a movie, entertainment. So if you like pure action with a little bit of heart I recommend you go see this movie ASAP, you wont be disappointed with Transformers : Age of Extinction",Transformers - Age of Extinction
848,suitanimals,Best movie i have seen so far,9,14 July 2014,"When i saw this in 3D on my birthday i knew that this was gonna be at least an 8/10 movie but no. Some people don't really understand transformers, I mean a 6.4? seriously? It was really good but i also have high expectations for Dawn of the planet of the apes so i hope that doesn't get underrated. My favorite part of the movie (spoiler) was when the Autobots entered Lockdown's ship, because the effects in there were great and I like Lockdown's Steeljaws. (Those are his minion wolves BTW) My favorite transformer is Optimus prime. My favorite Decepticon is Lockdown. Thanks for reading :)",Transformers - Age of Extinction
849,Thecampaignbook-8-248673,Best one yet.,10,20 July 2014,"First things first... Just ignore anyone who gives this film a rating any lower that a 6. Please don't listen to them. Seriously though, this was the best one yet, some might say i'm bias because I'm the biggest Transformers fan, and I love anything transformers(with the exception of the little kiddie show Rescue Bots... Couldn't survive 2 minutes of it). Truth be told none of these films are meant to be Oscar worthy, highly praised masterpieces, they are meant to be a fun, action packed adventure to numb you're brain and make you forget about the real world for 2 hours. People just don't get that, and a lot of people just like to be assholes everyday of their lives... Anyway, the movie was incredible! One of the most amazing experiences I've ever had in a theater in my entire life. Anyone saying this film was boring? No! Boring is a drama or a tragedy film, or a romance. Yuck! This movie is an incredible film that keeps me looking at the screen instead of my phone screen! Easily the most fun and action packed film of the summer, hell, the entire damn year! And the year is still no where near over yet. We still have Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy and also Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1 and much much more! The film stars an incredible cast, such as some of my personal favorites, Mark Wahlberg, Stanley Tucci, TJ Miller, Kelsey Grammar and Titus Weliver. The film also features two rising stars Nicola Peltz and Irish actor Jack Reynor, these two where amazing in my opinion! Nicola was stunning and did great with what she had, as for Jack? Well I want to see more of him, and as for anyone saying he had no purpose past the first act and for the love story, you're wrong! He played a role throughout the film and also at the final battle! We also had Li Bingbing and Sophia Myles who didn't do a whole lot but were cool and I pray they will be in the next film! Now for the robot cast and oh my god its amazing! Featuring the return of Peter Cullen, who got to show a different side of Optimus Prime that I absolutely loved. John DiMaggio portrayed Crosshairs, who had a pirate slash hit-man vibe to him, it was awesome. The one and only John Goodman gave his EPIC voice to Hound, the overweight weapons specialist, and robo-comedic relief. The amazing Ken Watanabe portrayed Robo-Samurai warrior Drift, who was amazing and had some lines that not many can really appreciate, unless you are Japanese, or you respect Japanese culture. The Autobots were fantastic! Now for the evil robot baddies. Frank Welker returns as his G1 Season 3 character, Galvatron, and let me just say, it was incredible to hear him as Galvatron once more. Frank also lent his growls, grumbles and other guttural noises to the Vehicons, as well as the alien things in Lockdown's Ship! Though he is only credited as Galvatron. Speaking of Lockdown, who is THE most Badass villain you've ever seen, or heard, in an action film, was voiced by Mark Ryan, who previously voiced Bumblebee in the first Transformers film, and also Jetfire in Revenge of the Fallen, gave us a very different and incredible badass voice that sends chills down you're spine. The film had strong characters, that were really well written, Marky Mark played the father figure Cade. Kelsey Grammar played the Badass Government official who wants all the robots dead. Titus Weliver played the badass Savoy, leader of his Black Opps robot hunting team called ""Cemetary Wind"". Stanley Tucci played the hilarious doofus who is the head of the KSI company, he ended up being one funny and cool character. I want to list more but I don't have the time too! Haha! Every single time an autobot spoke, or a villain spoke I had my ""happy moment"" I should say... Haha. Oh and FYI, this movie is kind of a 2 hour teaser trailer for Transformers 5. Seriously haha, so much was left open for the sequel. Galvatron was pretty much a teaser as well. Also his final line was pretty much, OK guys! See you in Transformers 5! Bye! *walks off screen* haha. The Dinobot were also mean as a tease as they will obviously play a role in transformers 5. Bay really went all out and I respect him as a director. I don't think he deserves the hate he is getting. Honestly, don't listen to anyone who bashes it. They use zero logic and only like bashing films for fun. Anyone who truly hates this film is a boring ass human being who should have their heads checked! But hey, everyone has opinions so.. Yeah. For last words I'll say this movie was an incredible ride, and the very reason we go see films in the theaters. Also sorry for a half-asses review, as It didn't cover everything. I am off to work in a few minutes! So I couldn't sit here and think of EVERYTHING. But please consider what I said, and if you haven't seen it yet, go see it NOW! Right now! It shouldn't disappoint you! Seriously it shouldn't, I saw the film 7, yes SEVEN times in the theater already and every time the theater was packed and at the end everyone cheered! In fact people booed at the fact that there was nothing in the credits teasing TF5! People wanted more! As do I! I plan to go back and see it a few more times because its worth making my wallet cry!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
850,deepakraj_1987,Much Much Better Actions,10,27 June 2014,"Me and my friends just planned for a movie and dinner on Friday, Luckily we found Transformers: Age of Extinction releases on the same day and never had a 2nd choice for other movie for Friday night ;) Just as we though the movie was really awesome.In Transformers Age of Extinction, the story line was totally different from other parts... I just can't take my eyes a bit from the movie, just thinking what could be the next thing that is going to happen... when the dinosaurs joined autobots, it was just stunning actions... Bumblebee's comical actions are really awesome specially when bumblebee saw his cloned version, he had gone mad which was so funny.I love to watch this movie once again in theaters because I missed the Transformers title by reaching 5 mins late to the movie... I know it sounds crazy, But I guarantee you that Transformers: Age of Extinction is really filled with awesome stunts and new autobots which keeps you entertaining till end of the movie.Also there is new character in the story which was not shown and called as creator of optimus prime, who wants prime back... I think the next part will be continued with the unknown character called Creator. I almost forgotten to tell about Megatron, he was recreated in a different form but not much involve in this part, hopefully expected in the next part.Overall I just Loved watching Transformers: Age of Extinction with my friends... Thanks for Michael Bay for such a fantastic movie for this year.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
851,byrdman_sean,a good movie but not a must see,6,28 June 2014,"The actions scenes are as to be expected from top notch directors. The action scenes seemed to cover for the thin plot at times which made the movie drag. The change in cast members made a need to rebuild the relationships between the Transformers and their human liaison which is rocky throughout the entire movie. This would have been a halfway descent start, if this were the first installment of the quadrilogy. Since it is not the rebuilding of an entire new plot kind made the movie longer than it should have been. So, if you are in the market for a movie that has very good visual fight scenes but running thin on a fulfilling plot then this is your movie. It is not a bad movie, it just didn't leave me with the urge to give it a standing ovation.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
852,rafaelseanputra,Fan-Tas-Tic,9,11 July 2014,"This is my first review, so I'm sorry if there is any mistake.I'm a big fan of transformers live action film series since I saw the first movie. Since, the first movie, I know that all the film inside the series is very long, so I have prepared myself for a long movie, and I am right, the film is a really long film.You know, I don't know why there is so many negative reviews for this film, the only things matter to me is the duration of the film. But, I think the fight scene could paid the duration.The duration, I think is paid by the fabulous fighting scene ( by human or transformers).First, the actor, I praised them all, even though they perform less than what we have expected. This is because I have been performing for theater since I am six years old and I know what they feel under the pressure that a lot of people will watch their performance.Next, the story in general. I must admitted that the story is a little surprising, with adding the idea of the creator of Transformers. But, I still think that the story is just the same with the previous film (just with a little surprise in some occasion). Finally, the visual effect. Once again, Transformers give us a film with a crazy and wonderful visual effect, from Autobots and Decepticons, all is perfect.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
853,SohoLondon,Best Transformers so far.,8,9 August 2014,"They're back – and busting the block harder than ever.England wimped out of the World Cup and Murray faded out of Wimbledon but, don't worry, you can be sure of the Transformers giving their all as they slug it out on our screens this summer. While detractors of director Michael Bay enjoy being snide over thin plots and a thunderous assault of CGI, fans of the franchise love him precisely for that. If you want emotional depth, The Fault in Our Stars is probably the movie for you. If you want imaginative visual destruction on a massive scale that pushes effects to the limit, Transformers just cannot be beaten. That's what summer blockbusters are all about. Not robots talking about their feelings. Bay is a visual filmmaker with a flare for unbridled excess and no-one puts more on screen for the budget than him. He burns through nearly a quarter of a billion dollars in 165 minutes to provide the best whizz bang money can buy. And, while these films have always been about spectacle, in a shock move for this fourth installment there's actually an enjoyable plot to (almost) follow and interesting human characters. After the initial fan outcry of Shia LaBeouf not returning, thankfully that means his parents and associated awkward 'comedy' moments have gone too. It also means double the hunks as Mark Wahlberg and Jack Reynor now provide the non-CGI eye candy along with Nicola Peltz as the obligatory Supermodel Girlfriend. They are the 'everyday American Joes' that discover a Transformer in hiding before setting off to battle around the globe. And while that introduction is familiar, the reasons for dashing around the globe are the most cohesive and well written so far. Which, admittedly, is a welcome change for Transformers. The humans are also given one of the film's most memorable fight sequences, down the side of a Chinese slum, with no robots in sight. Luckily, as far as the franchises finances are concerned, the Transformers shift most of their action to the huge emerging market that is China. While there are the obvious commercial benefits to that – there's even Chinese product placement – Bay has always loved his luscious landscape shots and China certainly delivers on location. From Hong Kong Harbour to the Great Wall, the landscapes provide beautiful, epic backdrops for the equally epic CGI flash bang – and where better to introduce the dragon-like Dinobots? Who doesn't want to see huge robot dinosaurs tearing through the streets of Hong Kong? With ships being dropped on them. Subtle this is not. It may be very, very long and have more baddies than one movie can skillfully handle, but they are obviously being introduced to cause future mayhem – or 'Bayhem' – in later films. Simply put, it's the best of the bunch so far and makes us very excited at the prospect of the rest of the trilogy.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
854,jeanetterobergeau,Creative and Complete Awesomeness,7,11 October 2014,"I'm young, but honestly I think all you critics out there are being to harsh. Transformers Age of Extinction is the one of the best movies I have seen this year and it will continually be one of the best movies I have seen ever. Michael Bay said that Dark of the Moon was going to be the last but after seeing how much people loved it he decided to make another sequel and it turned out better than I thought. He managed to continue the story successfully, even with new characters. The musical scores was incredible and Imagine Dragons did just as well as Linkin Park did so it did great. To the critics who said Transformers Age of Extinction was horrible, its your opinion but your being a little too harsh, for crying out loud. Its Transformers, no matter what story line or the characters Michael Bay is genius.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
855,danielsmokey420,Not very good at all,2,24 July 2014,"Before this movie began, I told myself that I should expect special effects, hot girls and some pretty corny lines. What I got was complete overkill in terms of the special effects, not much on the hot girls part, and lines that weren't just corny, but totally lame.I thought the runtime was way too long, it felt almost like I was torturing myself by sitting through the constant, non-stop bombardment of explosions and slo-mo action scenes.Mark Wahlberg gave a decent performance, but his character, as well as all of the others, were just too shallow and not fleshed out enough.

860,social-38-574908,Just bad,2,26 June 2014,"This movie was a big disappointment. Before going into details: I kinda liked the old movies. Even the 3rd one. They had some cool action in them, good CGI and a so-so story. In general, I enjoyed them. But this one is a disaster. It was so bad, I can't think of a single thing in it that I enjoyed. Let's start from the beginning. The characters are boring, dumb and you don't care about them. Tessa is introduced as one of the main characters, but what did she do? She did absolutely nothing for the plot besides looking hot. It's not funny when she runs to her boyfriend instead of the father. She was portrayed as the dumb, weak girl that always needs saving. The father is OK. He is a cool dude, but also dumb as bread. The boyfriend is a mess as well. You can't write a character so bad that he stands up in front of some evil robots and surrenders instead of shooting them. He would get killed in one shot. ALSO THAT SCENE IS NOT FUNNY! The CIA agent? Why the hell does he jump down the house to get that guy instead of just going down? The CIA boss? He walked in front of 2 giant robots fighting with a gun just to try to kill our main character who is trying to sacrifice himself anyways. Who in the right mind would do that? And for what point? What is he trying to achieve? The bots were OK. You don't care about any of them besides Optimus. Megatron has a so tiny role, you don't care about him either. That other overpowered robot, who conveniently let them escape the ship, yeah he's also not interesting. The scene assembly doesn't make sense. When they were in the racing car in the beginning, the location changed 10 times without any connections. First they are on a field, then suddenly in a backyard from some house, then in another place with more houses, then suddenly in a very slim alleyway, which sure was convenient to be there, then at that parking house / factory, and then suddenly somewhere else. Or when they tried to bring the seed away. The KIA guy clearly went with a car over a bridge, then the dinobots prepared to block the bridge so no one can follow. Next scene, the dinobots are with optimus, next scene at a completely different location, the KIA guy and the other characters are hugging. How can he be there so fast? Same for the other KIA girl they behind and went on the motorcycle, next ark, she suddenly runs to them as if it was just 100m and not a freaking motorcycle escape in between. There is so much teleporting in this movie. It is hard to stitch together how they can go from place A to place B. And that really bothered me. Realistic-ness of the movie is bad. How can Optimus rebuild himself just by scanning some random truck on the road? I don't get it. Why does the CIA want to kill them so badly that they risk their own lives? What if they killed them? Does it change anything for them? The giant robots still destroy everything. They are in a alien spaceship designed for robots, yet they have small seats for humans and mounted weapons for them to shoot? The ship crashed, flips ten million times and is completely destroyed, but the humans inside, without any visor or protection, walk outside like nothing happened. When one of the transformers grabs them and jumps through some cars / buses, there is no way any of them could survive. In any scenario. Also in the end, Optimus can fly? Why did he not use that earlier? CGI was OK. I liked seeing transformers transform. The new human created transformers don't have much of a effect to talk about. Just this flying around in particles. But here's another thing that really bothered me about the CGI: The sound design while stuff is happening! You see boom boom pow pow but you don't hear it. Sometimes all sounds from the environment are missing. What's with humans screaming while they (try to act like they) are scared and running away? What's with sound of houses crashing, glass shattering? It was all missing or very settle. One thing you keep hearing is that stupid autobot monologue / comments over the explosion. Bots fighting was boring as well. It just didn't have the 'wow! There are 2 giant robots fighting' effect. Explosions were way too much. It was just explosion, explosion, explosion, explosion, explosion, explosion, explosion, explosion. Bot punches bot? Explosion. Bot falls on the ground? Explosion. It was not even good looking. Just firework sparks coming out of the ground. The dinobots were what I really wanted to see, but just optimus riding on one in one fight scene is not enough. Don't put it on the movie poster if you make it so minor. Product placement, oh god. So much product placement. Hey, here is a explosion, better put a victoria's secret ad right in front of it. A guy is wearing sunglasses? Make sure they see the gucci logo!!! Oh there is a car crash and now there are thousands of beer bottles on the gorund. Make sure they all have the logo visible and the main character drinks one. Also why was there a damn pony from my little pony in the movie? It was not funny, it was just annoying.In general, I didn't like the movie. I was so bored during all of it. I didn't care about the character, didn't care about the plot, didn't care about the autobots, didn't care about the dinobots and eventually didn't even care about Optimus. This movie makes me not going into a transformers movie from Micheal bay again.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
861,jmf45,Definite Improvement over the Initail Trilogy,6,26 June 2014,"I had medium hopes for this movie since I feel like that I am minority on my friends when it comes to the film series and that fearing that some of the main issues that I had from the last two would be present in this film, and fearing that it will be another complaint among my amigos. Luckily,(keeping this review spoiler free)this film not only killed my fears but actually impressed my bay-hating friends and are reconsidering their own opinions. The film itself was a massive improvement from Dark of the Moon and ESPECIALLY Revenge of the Fallen (I liked it but they were some issues like *Devastator's Balls and the college sex jokes, and humor/dialogue that felt forced, unfunny and downright not appropriate for this kind of franchise* and it somewhat dissuaded me a bit from the franchise). All the robot characters were very fleshed out and can tell who's who and the humans and their dialogue were actually enjoyable. only issues are basically some logic/decision making on behalf of the crew and script writer, not clearing some continuity issues and could shave a good 20 minutes and get straight into the meaty stuff Other than that, what an excellent improvement from the last trilogy and looking forward to the future of our favorite robots in disguise",Transformers - Age of Extinction

It was all but Loud Robot fighting.. and many mistakes throughout the length of the movie with respect to various aspects. Humour again was very low lined.

Movie starts off on a different note - even the stretched movie ends abruptly.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
863,fernbern0131,Honestly the best Transformers movie yet.,10,26 June 2014,"Let me start by saying, I'm a child of the 80's. I saw the original ""Transformers: The Movie"" in 1986 (I was only 14). So take that for whatever it is worth. I liked all three previous movies, with Dark of the Moon being my favorite, until tonight. Age of Extinction is a heck of a movie and probably my favorite of all time. I'm not part of the ""hate the movie because Michael Bay directed it"" crowd. Bay has always done well with the Transformers series (his remake of Nightmare on Elm Street was an abomination). So I'm neither a fan or hater of Michael Bay. That being said, this was an outstanding movie. WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS. PROS: The new human cast was a huge improvement. CGI was much better. You can actually tell the robots apart, even during the fight scenes. The Dinobots transform several times. Excellent plots and sub-plots. Autobot characters are more developed. Crosshairs seems, at times, to be power hungry and want to be the leader. John Goodman as Hound is really entertaining. SPOILER: Galvatron is Megatron reincarnated. He even says, ""I am Galvatron!"" He takes control of the human created Transformers as his army. Lockdown is an awesome character. He should have been ""held over"" for another movie. Many other pros to list here but I am limited. ANOTHER SPOILER: As Optimus leaves Earth, he sends a message to the creators, ""I am coming."" This opens the doors to the possibility of the Quentissons. (If you are a fan of the original franchise, you'll know what that means.) CONS: Poor Ratchet and Leadfoot. I find it hard to believe that a Wrecker like Leadfoot could be taken down by humans. It is a very long movie, but not boring. I do NOT like the way Galvatron, Stinger, and the new Decepticons transform. It is not shape-shifting, it's like sand forming. The Dinobots don't speak. Stanley Tucci's character is too much like Seymour Simmons. It is made clear that only 5 Autobots still exist. At the end of the movie only 1 Decepticon remains (Galvatron). A few others I won't care to mention.Overall, if you are going to see the movie expecting some sort of artsy- fartsy egg head ""nominated for best picture"" movie, don't bother. All those movies nominated for those awards are the ones nobody has ever heard of. But if you are a fan of the franchise or you like me, an older guy who likes seeing the characters from the cartoons and comics come to life, then you won't be disappointed. One more SPOILER: Galvatron exits the movie by saying, ""I will be back, for I am reborn.""",Transformers - Age of Extinction
864,wolverineyg,Wait for the DVD or for it on cable.,1,27 June 2014,"I've been a fan of Transformers since 1984 (I was 7) but damn it Michael Bay, you and your writers put the worst POS movie out there possible. I thought Transformers: Rise Of The Fallen was horrible (#'s 1 & 3 I enjoyed), but this Transformers made that one look like an Academy award winner. This film was so bad I thought about walking out a few times. Mark Wahlberg was so damn horrible in this film (sad because I like a lot of his others) as well as Nicola Peltz and Jack Reynor that I actually was praying that Shia Labeouf (who I couldn't stand and thought Walberg would work out much better) would jump out at some point screaming, ""OOOPPPTTTIIIMMMUUUSSS!!! Kill all the other human actors who suck except Kelsey Grammar!"" just to save this film. I went to this to see the Dinobots and they ended up being basically background extras in a super cheesy, explosive, mess. There was so much you could have easily rewritten that would have totally changed the way this film turned out. My fiancé', who knows nothing about any past Transformer genres or who the characters are except Optimus, Megatron & Bumblebee and who enjoyed the first 3 films thought this film was horrible! Never thought I'd say it, but please don't make TF5 and when you said you were never going to make another after the third one you should have taken your own advice. The title ""extinction"" fit this film well.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
865,rena-liu94,"Commercial, pointless but looks beautiful",1,27 June 2014,"Despite the frosty reception Michael Bay has got for the previous Transformers films, he decided a 4th was necessary. Bring in Transformers: Age of Extinction. But does this film have more promise? Completely new human cast, introduction of the awesome Dinobots and surely some lessons learnt from the last 3 films. Unfortunately not, this film is riddled with disasters likely to leave you wondering why you had spent your time (a painstaking 165 minutes) and money.Michael Bay has been long criticized about his lack of a storyline and this installment of the Transformers franchise is no different. We finally get some background about the origins of Transformers but it is mentioned briefly and buried in the muddy waters of the rest of the plot. As for the rest of the storyline, it seemed pointless and discordant. Most notably, when the cast are thrown into China, it just seems like a completely different film altogether.Smart tactical move that the filming took place in 3 Chinese cities: Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai, as China are obsessed over Transformers. The Chinese are represented to please the mainstay of the Transformers fan base, however I wasn't very proud of their representation being a BBC (British born Chinese). According to the film, we are a manufacturing, kung fu fighting, but ultimately useless bunch of people who just run away screaming.The uncomfortable stereotyping didn't stop at the Chinese, but included the Irish, Texans and women for cheap laughs. Forced humour seemed to riddle the dialogue, even a crude joke about slavery that left me squirming in my seat in embarrassment. I don't think I so much as chuckled at any of the jokes, and I don't think even your 8 year old friend/relative would have laughed. It's a shame; I had so much hope for Mark Wahlberg's comedic potential which just fell flat.As for the rest of the cast, apart from the Transformers themselves, they felt meaningless and again only there to please the audience. The Transformers franchise staple 'pretty girl', Tessa Yeager, was one dimensional, bland and her character glossed over. However a spin on the usual leading couple, as Tessa is the daughter of Cade, played by Mark Wahlberg, lead to an almost genuine relationship moment when Tessa was threatened at gunpoint in front of her father, but ruined by the fact you knew it was coming due to the trailer. Her boyfriend, Shane, was shamelessly slotted in to offer some eye candy, it didn't provide anything for me I'm afraid apart from sheer frustration. Too many characters with barely any development and limited real personality made it hard to identify with anybody. And to the people who have already seen the film, doesn't anybody care about Lucas?!Bad storyline, uncomfortable stereotyping and poor characters would seem like a recipe for disaster, but there is one final nail in the coffin. Shameless product placement. Glaringly obvious examples included audio products, beer, energy drinks, milk, water, a shopping mall and of course cars. You might think that product placement doesn't bother you; after all it's helping to fund the film right? But the product placement was extremely forced, an illustration being Stanley Tucci drinking from a Chinese brand (yes it's the brainwashing of the Chinese audience again) of milk for an unnecessary 10 second shot.To try to counter balance my negatives I dug deep to try to find some positives. First of all, I watched the film in 3D and I have to say the CGI was breathtaking especially during the battle scenes. The battle scenes are my second positive point, not only did they look good, they suited my action film partiality. I would like to say that, at my screening, the film was appreciated with a raucous applause at the end and even during it, so maybe I am in a minority? Although, I did watch the first screening available to the public, so I think anything would've pleased die hard Transformers fans.If you want a practically non-existent plot with a practically non- existent cast and CGI battle scenes to sort of warrant the 165 million dollar budget, you will probably enjoy Transformers: Age of Extinction. Otherwise, well I think it's quite obvious what to do",Transformers - Age of Extinction
866,reddogninja,Save your money .. Don't feed the Bay,3,27 June 2014,"Worst of the transformers movies. Was okay until about a 3rd of the way through. Mark Wahlberg was better than Shia, but the movie was bloated with too many similar scenes.Enough chase scenes and slow motion explosions for the whole of 2014. It would be nice to see some sort of characters developed for the transformers. Because they are created as one dimensional punchlines there is no possibility to have any interesting story that involves the transformers interacting with each other.Wait for the DVD if you must see it, but you wont be missing much if you avoid it all together.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
867,haydenhazzard,why are the critics so hard on this film?,10,27 June 2014,"Unlike the first three, the focus is more on the transformers. To any moviegoer this is awesome. More money-shots! The effects make you feel like you're watching a real life robot brawl. Anyone who likes action will love this.The (depth of the) plot is also a draw in feature. It is very mysterious, and the last line leaves you wondering: what comes next for this billion dollar franchise?Critics can be so harsh on even the best movies. This by far, is the best of the transformers. Watch it in imax 3d if possible. If not possible, watch in real d 3d). If 3d gives you a headache, watch in 2d.

868,Babetoyland,Transformers Age of Extinction is a Visceral Stunning Fiilm! Gave me Goosebumps to the End!,10,27 June 2014,"I saw this latest installment of Transformers movie movie franchise at an IMAX theater in 3 D. Definitely the BEST way to see this movie! The way Michael Bay moves the camera, stomach was doing somersaults (in a good way ) like I was in screen with the characters! BAY is smart as a whip and knows how to manipulate cameras like no other director can! I'm a Transformers toy fan, but came with a few pals who decided for the film even though they weren't TF fans organically, and they ALL had a great time in the film. I loved how the filmmaker made the Autobots ESP Optimus Prime actually have feelings, expressions and motivations. I also LOVED Mark Wahlberg as the new human interest including the funny interplays with his daughter and boyfriend. Wahlberg definitely needs to be a regular for the franchise as he delivered the funny lines perfectly with a straight face, and his machismo made him a believable fighter against the bad guys. As far as plot. I don't get why all the critics bashing is going on. This is a fun film, and the many plot lines actually prevented me from being bored. The pace was great as I was trying to figure out what would come next and the action between transformers, humans, bad guys etc kept accelerating. That's the way a movie should be, it should pick up and not lose steam as it goes on. I got more stimulated after the characters got established. Then all the action got unleashed and NON stop with one amazing exhilarating sequence after the other. Wow even China action pieces were crazy amazing! More jaw dropping sequences than even the trailers ever showed. I was on the edge of my seat . Bay really outdid himself on the things he can make happen on a visceral level and on a visual level, . Oh and the DINOBOTS! damn so realistic! And interesting. I don't want to give anything away but this really added a unique element that has never been seen before in previous transformers films. this is the BEST film to date in the series! Really love the way the ending will set up the new trilogy! Michael Bay please don't give this to any other director because only you know how to create the the transformers transitions and fight sequences and action. Only you know how to put me where the action is! I love Optimus Prime in this film, and love the wisdom he doled out in the film. Emotional and I'm not an emotional guy. I t made me think at the end of the film about my own mortality. OK enough about that. Autobots ROLL out!!!!!!!! Man double thumbs up! You won't be disappointed!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
869,daddybeesley,"2 & 3/4 hours later, and the only color I see is gray...",5,27 June 2014,"Back in 2007 we were all given the gift of how cool the brand of Transformers could be! It was alien meeting human, working together, to defeat a common enemy. It was Megatron, Starscream, Jazz, and even a heroine that could hold her own ground! Although I didn't care for the 2009 edition (Revenge of the Fallen) as much as the first, they were both really enjoyable!The office paid for us to go and see Age of Extinction today; I am SO happy it was on their dime, because if I had just paid $7.00 to $13.00 to see thisI'd be pretty disappointed.First off, the movie's length. I expect that will be the most complained about item in regards to this film. TWO HOURS AND 45 MINUTES?!!!! The story line isn't that compelling, it moves along really slowly, and your reward for sitting through the length of a movie isno real resolution. The major catastrophe that they're trying to avoid during the movie, doesn't really come into play until 75% of the movie has gone by, and it just doesn't feel all that urgent.The CGI was AMAZING!!! But as the Man of Steel proclaims to the world, movies do not succeed on CGI alone.I was a huge Megan Fox fan! I really don't know what else is on her acting resume besides those two Transformer movies, but her attitude, and personality were perfect for the role. Rosie Huntington-Whitely, aka NOT Megan Fox, could have been replaced by a pin up poster, and the heroine choice here is a very attractive 19-year-old Nicola Peltz, playing the role of a 17-year-old ""adult"" role to her inventive (yet ruggedly handsome) single father, Mark Wahlberg. Their interaction is fine, but Mark makes a point to say stuff like ""I am the one who taught you how to braid your hair, and make your first solder."" So this girl has been around machines and gadgets all of her life, we're led to believe that she can assemble and disassemble them alongside her father (something they were doing to bring in money), and yet when her life is threatened by machinesshe acts like a girl? Running and screaming is just NOT what I turn to this franchise for!!! ENOUGH!!!Note to all beautiful actresses the world over that seek a leading role in an action flick; bring the attitude, bring the pain, bring the determination, or go home!!!The spontaneous humor was toned down too. Accidentally laughing is another great thing about some of the prior movies. There really aren't any repeatable character lines that draw up fond memories. The movie isn't offensive, but it's not really all that compelling either. With that in mind, 2.75 hours is a long time to invest in something to come away feelingbland.Wait for Redbox; and even then only when they're bringing it back on a ""back again"" to get yourself up to speed before going to see the next installment in two to three years.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
870,al-brown79,"Simply the Worst, Prepare for a Headache",2,27 June 2014,"For real, take some ibuprofen before you see this- it'll give you a headache worse than Dark of the Moon and Man of Steel. On to the review... I officially lost interest in this movie when the director did. In the scene where Optimus is being pursued by Longshot, while they're fighting off in the background, the camera decided to follow the people around instead. The Transformers were reduced to an afterthought. I was also hoping to see the Dinobots before the two-hour mark, but I was disappointed here too. And oh yeah, way to waste Frank Welker yet again. Megatron was so iconic in the original series. Now Mr. Welker has gotten what, maybe 6 lines of dialog in 3 movies as Soundwave and Galvatron? I can't even get invested in the other primary characters either because they're never actually introduced- we only ever actually hear their names by accident. When Bay inevitably makes the 5th installment I really just hope the bots we get introduced are named Guy, Buddy, Champ, and Friend.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
871,vincenzobee,What the heck are critics talking about? This was good!,10,27 June 2014,"***** Contains Spoilers ******All the Bay haters out there I don't understand any of them.. critics included I've learned to not pay any attention to when it comes to action/sci-fi or horror reviews because they will always be bad with no inkling of what THEY expected to see.. All I hear in the reviews are ""excessive explosions in the usual Michael bay way"" well.. thats what Michael bay does! Optimus prime spouting his usual rally cry and words of ""prophetic motivational speeches"" well... Thats what Optimus Prime does! Any who grew up with the series knows that.. why would you change it?As far as the plot is concerned, there has been only one plot and there is only one plot... Get the decepticons and save the earth. What other plot are people looking for? The plot in this one was not complex.1*alien war messed up the city2* decepticons are dead but auto-bots are still here.. hey lets blame them no even better lets hunt em down and kill them3* meanwhile we make a deal with the badder guys to get their tech3B* Intertwine all this with the dad and daughter (and boyfriend driving GymKhana style in the ford focus had red bull written all over it)4* we come up with cool idea of making our own auto-bots but don't have any auto-bots to use as a model.. oh wait we have megaton's head (forgetting that he was evil and this wouldn't be a good idea is the only plot hole that made no friggin sense but hey its human to make a mistake)5* create galvatron and are not the least suspicious that he acquired speech on his own and put him back into play even after the first ""run"" against the auto-bots clearly showed something was wrong when they lost control of him. (But in Micheal's defense, had this occurred in a real life scenario, giving the track record and the decision making mindset of our own military's brightest leaders this oversight and outcome would have been totally plausible and expected so Im not taking points away for it being in a movie)6* battle mega-galva-tron and set the stage for transformers 5:Return of megatron (by him saying I have been re-born) roll creditsNow what did you all expect to see different here? Well what did it for me? 1) DINOBOTS which should have been in all three of the previous movies. They were always my favorites of all the auto-bots and when I heard they were in this one I was 100% committed..2) Action from the start and it doesn't let up.3) Going back to when the boyfriend was driving I heard someone say 'hes drifting with a rally car? who does that?"" even my friends asked.. its called gymkhana.. youtube it.. Ken Brock would be proud..https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUO-lPubXeI4)Mark Wahlberg was much better in the role than Shia Lebouf..period5) The greedy CEO I hated him at first but after the revelation he'd been played himself, his redemption although comedic made him a likable character in the end6) the selection of cars A+.. I could tell Bay was a need for speed fan.7) 165min for any movie is long although I did not see anyone crying about how long each installment of lord of the rings was because that was 3 hours too long but Im not a fan of the movie trilogy I felt the animated series I enjoyed as a youngster was much much better. But transformers didn't feel like 2+ hours of movie because there was action all the way through it. If you are a fan you wont be disappointed... because you already know what to expect.. If you aren't a fan and didn't like it.. oh well sorry your folks didn't buy you transformers when you were a kid..consider yourself cheated..",Transformers - Age of Extinction
872,gliddenjulian,"An Alright Film, Some Cheesy Moments; Not The Greatest",4,28 June 2014,"-Contains Spoilers- Saw the movie at my local AMC this morning. Have to admit, I was actually all for this movie over the whole conspiracy of the Dino Bots being put into the movie. For sure, I know that this is Bay's handy Work filled with cheesy comedy sink-holes that not always make everyone laugh when stated, but I was disappointed with the whole fact that they never spoke. So, my conclusion to this film is, Bay's Dinobots Have Got Nothing on the TV Originals. The designs are better, but still lesser than in the cartoons.Also, the scene when Optimus was about to engage in being repaired by Mark Wahlberg, I remember he mentions in the early garage scene that only his Autobots can fix him. Then later, he scans a truck out after the big early chase scene and simply is back to his usual looking self? Huh?Seriously did not like Nicola Peltz. Her eyes were way too vainer and obviously was a poor Megan Fox imitation. Jack Reynor made a terrible selfish boyfriend in this film. Obviously didn't go through flying hoops to care about Walhberg in saving his daughter, nearly left Peltz at the end of the film to leave him to die. And just how does a race-car driver rarely known in certain areas of Texas show up out of nowhere to pick everyone up during the early chase, right before T.J. Miller's character had died?And to my thoughts about Galvatron immensely large Automobile clone factory, what happened to the other Deceptions? I mean when it was explained that Galvatron was secretly infecting everything with Megatron's chromosomes, I thought because they're downloading data from Megatron's head that it would make sense that every automobile such as Stinger was rendering them possible of Megatron's DNA, therefore making them as either clone, or Decepticon, but the whole chromosomes reveal is what I think killed the whole thing of there ever being a Unicron in Bay's series because its still centered around Megatron.And the Weapons Chamber scene. Find one bad-ass looking blaster-sword, only pull down one?And last but not least, the Seed (Bomb) has a tracking sensor. Why wasn't that used early in the movie if it was such a hard task led for humans to go through hoops in order to find it?So yeah, all in all, I liked the movie, found it alright. Not going to say that it is absolutely one of the greatest film you've got to go see in the summer for there are just scenes that'll make your head scratch like it has already done for me. Nothing really new, just lesser Autobots again and Decepticons are outnumbering the Autobots...yet again.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Secondly this is one very very boring movie. there is no plot to speak off, no characters to get any attachment to, no sense of a story what so ever. the only thing that is there is Michael Bays trademark explosions. 150 minutes of them... You could take away every human in the movie and still have the same result. You could take away 100 of the 166 minutes and still have the same result.

It has stunning special effects which you can appreciate better if you watch it in IMAX.

Now in my 40's I was excited to see the newest installment of the Transformers movies. If your love the CGI effects and don't know anything about the Transformers, you might make it through the almost 3 hour movie, ALMOST. I, as many others who were at the midnight showing, were very disappointed in this movie. There were so many things that weren't true to the Transformers that it pained me to watch. One of the biggest upsets was the way the Deceptacons transformed. What was that, never, ever, ever, have they done that. That to me was just AHHHHH for lack of a better word. I for one didn't care of Optimus Prime's new character attitude, or Bumblebee for that matter. Now Hound on the other had, voice over by John Goodman, was awesome in his role. Galvatron and the way that he came to be stayed true to form but the story was confusing, and the story line never really developed. I am not a fan of this Film, and I still think the 1st Transformers was the best of all 4. Where was Sam Whitwiki's Mom and her humor?

879,the-densing11,Slightly Negative,4,29 June 2014,"This movie is, for me, described as cool. But I must say, this movie is kind of worse than the prequel, as it lacks character development. The other Autobots who weren't with us during the first three movies were shallow in terms of showing their character when they just showed on screen.Secondly, this movie was focused on the humans more than the transformers themselves. Yes we heard and saw how cruel humans were, killing the remaining alien species, but how about showing us more on how they felt and how they did something in order to react to these alien-cruel acts. Maybe then I could agree with the title presented to us, Transformers: Age of Extinction.To sum that up, it's still a pretty good movie, with awesome visuals, but please, get those transformers do what they do and show us more on who they are. We can't just read from comics who those guys were and how did they get there; we need them, the fully- understood them, especially to us, current generation viewers to get the story and like them more, as a race unique in their own way on the big screen.P.S. I hope that the fifth movie will start re-satisfying again those who lost faith in this movie, and the critics always hitting it hard. Whoever the writer may be, may he learn more about what's good for the next movie to all viewers of all genres, making a better story following this movie and attract more folks who want just the right plot and action sequences altogether.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

It should have been shortened and set up as more of a love connection between Tessa and Shane, rather than completely focusing on the failure of the father. There should have been more of a confrontation between Cade and Shane, for example Shane should have brought Tessa home in the beginning of the movie in order to set up more of a dramatic plot. The plot thickens in the middle of the movie as the action picks up and the plot thickens. As far as graphics and action, I would give this movie a 10. The end was took me back to my childhood days, incorporation of the dinobots Asa niter all third path was a nice twist tho the summation of the the story. The end was extraordinary leaving the viewers to use their imagination to decide what the future will hold for Optimus Prime. I would like to see KSI/Joshua bring back some autobots such as ratchet, jazz or iron hide in future movies. Problems with the movie include: Mark Wahberg started out very well, then overplayed his roll. Kelsey Grammar should NEVER play a roll in an action movie, Kelsey is know for his intellect, not an action or evil roll. Stanley Tucci/ Joshua, was the only character that played his part accurately and assumed his role in a positive aspect. T.J.

Even a freshmen film student with little experience in movie editing could have made the scenes less choppy. You know when they use the term ""too many cooks in the kitchen""? I think there were too many big executives calling the shots in this production. Seems to me like Bay wanted to involve all his sponsors and executives and allowed just about every guy who wanted to put in their script into this crap shoot sci-fi mess. Introducing another 100+ new transformers without any character name was bad in T2 and T3 but this one takes it to a whole new level of amateur editing/story-telling. Another over-the-top CGI in the final scenes with no- name (out-of-nowhere) transformers getting blown out by the good Autobots was just a complete chaos and ridiculous CGI effort. I wouldn't even bother telling readers to get the DVD.

I am so glad I didn't take their advice, and I went and saw it. It was a very good movie with a lot of action. I don't want to give anything away, but it was nice to see they actually had a lot of different types of transformers in the movie, and a great variety. Someone had mentioned that the movie seemed to go on forever. I didn't even notice how long it was. I never got bored or wished it was over. It was the right length. I would definitely recommend not listening to the other reviews and just go see it. You will enjoy it.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
887,daolamhung,"""This is not a war, it's human raping""",3,29 June 2014,"Dear Michael BayAs a great fan of Transformers Trilogy, I'd like to inform you that I was deeply disappointed in Transformers: Age of Extinction.I believe that I was f**ked enough. And if you have an intention of making another sequel, better take it as an end to this franchise. It needs a good ending. Please, no more ""discover"", no more ""awaken"", no more ""secret""...and no more bullshit resurrection. For god sake, these are movies, not a TV series.And what, human can build transformers? Where is the f**king boundary? ...Terrible!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
888,darkmilan,by far one of the worst movies ever. Please pass the word. Save your money.,1,29 June 2014,I can't believe I sat through the whole thing. I kept waiting for it to get better but it kept getting worse so sad and I love the Transformers.all movies are money maker but this is by far was just made for money it had no cinematic value at all my plot was awful.please pass the word save someone else's time and money. Mark Wahlberg is a good actor but he couldn't keep this movie from sinking. It was awful convoluted from start to finish. I'm not sure if any actor could have done anything with the script and plot line. The special effects were okay but once you've seen transforming Liquid Metal such as terminator 2: so many times you've seen it enough. I hope that Michael Bay never make another dollar behind the Transformers franchise. George Clooney once said that Batman and Robin killed the franchise for years and that was a great storyline behind the Batman character unfortunately transformers do not have a strong as a following as Batman so I think and I hope and pray this will be the last Transformers movie.,Transformers - Age of Extinction
889,adedapo-ogunba,Greatest movie ever!!,9,29 June 2014,"OK, i do not know what you people are talking about. Michael Bay truly out did himself again. The plot is wonderful, the relationships are wonderful. and just everything about the movie is wonderful. I truly enjoyed myself watching this incredible movie. You people say you hate this movie is bad because its too long, you miss the old characters, and because a great father and daughter have a really close relationship. You guys have to admit that you just have a short attention span of a 9 year old. The plot is really simple too understand, but you people are too jealous and close minded to understand it. The government is trying to get rid of the transformers they think that's giving trouble and they are trying to control the technology so they can get all the power. Then the Autobots have to escape them and take them down with their live with a traitor tracking them all down and more of the plot is there. I like how they didn't only focus on bumble bee( they did before because SAM was always there screaming and driving around with em ), but they focused on everyone. They even showed Optimus dark side and they actually made mark apart of the story. He actually has a role and he actually helps Optimus to defeat lock-down at the end. also, you guys need to stop saying Optimus got his butt kicked because he clearly said they was ambushed. Plus the movie is not boring, they need to take their time to explain the story and why everything is happening in the story. We always don't need explosions at the beginning and fights. You PEOPLE need to stop being close minded little 9 year old children and actually try to understand the story not judge it. Why don't you guys try directing the movie better than it was. Oh, you guys cant because your stuck with dead end jobs and busy watching power rangers. Every actually had a role, this movie had a great story, and you people need to read this and take consideration. Maybe you guys might be even smart enough to understand basic English. Great job Michael Bay please comment back time, Thank you for this mind blowing movie. My mind has been reborn.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
890,somebody1934,Thought it was quite good.,9,29 June 2014,"Not sure why people are saying it is bad, about how the plot was too confusing and the fact that it ran a long time. In this movie, the plot was definitely harder to understand compared to the other 3 movies, but are people seriously that lazy to figure it all out? The duration of the movie was long, but I felt it was worth it. The fight scenes were evenly 'distributed' throughout the show which kept me entertained. Unlike the other 3 movies where there was talking for 2/3 of the movie and in the final third there was a huge action scene, but by then I was worn out. Of course the graphics were good. TF4 also showed more Autobot fighting as well, meaning we saw more Autobots in action, and it brought out more characteristics of each Transformer. It was funny as well which made it especially entertaining. Also, it isn't the usual Autobots vs Deceptacons which was a huge refresher for me. One problem though - they made the 'human extinction' a lesser of a deal than it sounded like in the posters/trailers.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

892,apriester1-41-408915,All over the place,5,30 June 2014,"I enjoyed the fighting scenes with the transformer. Everything else they could have kept that. First, i'm tired of seeing the ""pretty girl damsel in distress bit who is overly dressed and falling in love"". This is the worst acting I have seen from Mark Wahlburg. There were so many punch lines that probably would have been funnier w/Shia Labeouf and his parents. There was a lot of smiling when their faces should've been serious, the daughter was looking in the wrong direction during the fighting scenes between Optimus and Lockdown. I know they use a green screen but damn she should have at least looked in the right direction. When they were on those wires trying to climb out of the ship, I think that was the worst scene and not believable. The boyfriend was over the top, Mark's character was over the top as a single parent. There was just too many plots. I am not even going to get into the rest of the bad acting by the humans.. Best part of the movie was all the fighting scenes but I got tired of hearing John Goodman's voice as the transformer..",Transformers - Age of Extinction
893,reeganbird,"Just bad, really bad",2,30 June 2014,"Beyond the short shorts and the cool cars turning into alien robots, this movie has nothing else going for it. I have to mention the action. I can overlook a sense of reality for the sake of good action. But how many times can 3 people be ejected from cars, jump out of alien space ships, fall out of skyscrapers, be thrown over bridges, and get beat up by huge metal aliens in one day without injury? The 3 of them being thrown over the overpass was just too much. And I remember the girl taking an awesome fall and thinking, she must be hurt. Nope, got up and started running again. I literally fell in and out of sleep for the last hour of the movie.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
894,shawn-kroll,Good Movie Despite Negative Na Sayers (esp Prasad),8,30 June 2014,"First, just like a lot of people I was about 11 to 12 when I watch the absolutely FIRST episode of the Transformers. I collected the toys, even saw the animated movie in theaters (HOT ROD anyone). What can I say. I loved this movie. First...a lot of people were saying it was about 90 mins into the movie before the first action. WRONG...it was a bit but more like 30 to 45 mins into the movie. Mark Walberg is a fantastic actor regardless of what people say here..and he to me coming from movies like Lone Survivor and Shooter...he played a fantastic inventor. Kelsey Grammar was fantastic to.. Almost every single action brought something to the table. Also, since may people like Prasad want instant gratification...even in other action movies plots have to be developed...and Michael Bay did that...for people saying there was not plot, sorry but your dead wrong. If you missed it...we'll then you need to be more asute to the movies and books you watch/read. I find it funny how he mentions failures and Prime. Prime did lose a few times in the show too. Prime did lose a fight to Grimlock. He didn't really beat Megatron...they both mortally wounded each other. Being a leader isn't ABOUT winning all the time. It's about being caring for those in your command...it's about leading by example...self-sacrifice...and good leaders have troops that want to follow and die for them...even in the end Prime proves it...Bumblebee comes back to save him...despite being ordered away...because good leaders have that quality that you can get by just winning battles all the time. That means no challenge and THAT would be a boring movie. Bay did AWESOME at showing leadership and questioning decisions of losing men. I guess being military I get it. It did have many TRANSFORMING parts to the movie. Even in battle, maybe not as much. Also, Hound and others did have parts...last battle, saving Prime..etc. Please the Dinobots were consider legends and while I will agree I would have like to see Prime fight and have Grimlock submit..they were super cool. My wife and daughter even loved this film. While it didn't follow true to comics or TV. It was A LOT better than negative Nancy's on here are making it out to be. I didn't even realize 3 hours went by and guess what neither did my wife or daughter who is 11 with ADHD. She sat through the entire movie.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
895,jessicajoybanta87,Very Repetitive,5,30 June 2014,"Hey remember how good Transformers 2 & 3 were? Me either and this one was so much like those two. A whole bunch of extra BS that made the movie too long, too over the top, and boring. The story lines were almost identical. Also, more destruction I doesn't equal better movie, yeah we know you are good at elaborate special effects but it gets old really fast. The last 45 minutes should have been completely left out. The only reason I gave this movie 5 stars is for Mark Walberg. He was the only thing worth watching in the movie and I don't think he should be brought down for poor directing skills. I am really scared to see how Michael Bay slaughtered TMNT. Very disappointed!",Transformers - Age of Extinction

897,sherryjks,Best 3D movie of 2014 although a bit stretched,8,30 June 2014,"This is easily one of the best 3D movies I have seen so far in 2014. The sound effects, the graphics and the action sequences all are state of the art and insanely awesome.Definitely the story line was confusing (in fact you get lost just after 20 minutes of watching the movie), dialogues were lame and the movie was a bit stretched (at least by 45 minutes). But those who are rating the movie below average based on these factors are being unfair to the positive aspects of the movie. In fact, this review is in response to those reviewers who have rated this movie based on its negative factors alone (in fact I am astonished to see above 8 rating for X Men: Days of future past and a below 7 rating for this movie- I felt like leaving the theatre after 20 minutes of watching X-Men btw)). I thought that a balanced review of this movie was required..so wrote one. Go watch this movie with a light mind and enjoy the sound effects, the 3D graphics and the amazing action sequences. If you are an over- emotional, extra sensitive movie critic who rates movies on the basis of its negative aspects alone, then STAY at home !!!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
898,brock-williamson-3125,Good action movie with no multi-emotional attachment.,6,1 July 2014,"To start I had no Idea really what to expect when I walked into the theater. The first three transformers were good movies. I credit that to the director as well as the actors and characters in those first three movies. I am a Shia Labouf fan (as an actor not as a person). So, when I first saw the trailer with Mark Wahlberg and pretty much no other actors/actresses I knew. That being said I did the best I could to drop whatever expectations I had and approach it with an open mind.The movie was hilarious. The action was good. The only problem I had with the movie in my personal opinion is that they had scenes and situations in the movie that seemed to try and draw out an emotional response(i.e. happiness, sadness, anger) but never quite pulled it out of me. Characters dying suddenly, briefly going over important historical events, almost losing the fight, etc. In the beginning, Uncle Lucas is the comedic relief. You get attached to his humor, but you don't feel a super important attachment because they don't show a ton of history and don't show how he is really important to the family. He suddenly dies. Very suddenly. It was shocking, but throughout the rest of the movie they show how easily replaced he is by bringing in the character Joshua Joyce as the comedic relief and everyone chips in and makes the rest of the movie hilarious so you really don't miss Uncle Lucas all that much.They seemed to breeze over an important emotional historical event that could have made the ending so much sweeter is if we actually had more time to get attached to the mother who past away. Cade mentions to his daughter, Tessa, some things about her mom and tries to have this important moment, yet I felt no attachment. So, when that moment in the end I felt empty. Maybe that is because I am heartless, but I think it is because they could have done a better job drawing on the emotions of viewers.The typical boss battle in the end where it seems the autobots are going to lose and John Goodman the voice of the big robot named, Hound, is out of ammo and all hope is lost. Here comes Optimus riding on the back of a Trex Transformer. This moment had potential to be incredibly epic yet it lacked some...wow factors. It was cool and really neat, but they didn't do a good enough job of taking away all my hope and feeling like it was over. I felt like, ""oh this sucks, when is Optimus going to get there and save them?"" Then, sure enough they cut to Optimus resurrecting the dinosaur transformers, and they come charging in. Just lacked a little bit of epicness. The end battle was cool and awesome, I just had couple problems though. Harold Attinger appears out of no where. I am pretty sure he has teleportation skills. It was weird. Secondly, Galvitron is just hiding somewhere? A giant robot who has like ultimate power is just hiding where no one can see him? Then, just walks off into the sunset. Yeah that makes sense. Thirdly, during this whole Optimus, Bumblebee, and Cade against Lockdown battle were the dino-formers just sitting off to the side eating my popcorn? That fight could have been over quick if all them just tagged teamed and took care of Lockdown. That is all I am saying. The thing is, and I realize this movies that have illogical things happening often don't follow the rules of logic and common sense so this doesn't reflect on my review of this movie.Overall, good movie. Worth seeing for sure. Just, don't expect it to be anything but an action comedy that does nothing but make you laugh and say ""cool graphics and cool fight scene"". I did like this movie, just wasn't as good as the first three. So I say go in with zero expectations and you will have a good hearty laugh and have your jaw drop at some of the action scenes.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
899,sljmcasey97,Michael Bay makes Transformers worse,5,1 July 2014,"Firstly, the title. The movie lacks hard connection with its title. ""Age of Extinction"". If that bomb can only destroy 1 city, how is it ""age of extinction""? And, I was expecting a invasion some sort. But, only a bounty hunter, and Megatron reincarnated? that's not a global event. Then, the storyline. Basically, it's just a bunch of action scenes, with weak explanation of the storyline. See, it's all too thin. They're hunting Autobots, building transformers, then what? Adults and fans can't even get what they're trying to present to the viewers. Then the acting. In every transformer movie, the hot sexy girl is always the most useless. And it shows yet again in this. Nicola Peltz, yes she is attractive, but that doesn't hide her role in the film: nothing. Basically, all she did was attached a hook to the sword. You're not going to get any points from that Michael Bay. And the scene where she was trapped in that car? Please, if you're desperate for your life, you would SMASH the glass, not tap on it gently? And, the unlogical flaws. Crosshair, why the hell did he jump off that spaceship when they were needing him? just to kill off 2 ships? really? and, Lockdown's ship. Nicola was screaming in there, that ship was filled with mercs and hounds, how the hell they didn't hear her? And the size of that ""alien gun"" Mark was carrying, can it really takes down those big transformers? just a few to sums up everything Michael did wrong. Worst of the four, which means, it keeps getting worse. The only upsides are the visual genius of those working in this movie. 5 points is more generous than you think.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

902,glactin-graces,Pathetic!! Terrible!!! Very Bollywood!!!,1,2 July 2014,"Just like other respected reviewers am gonna mention that I have been a huge fan of the Transformers series. They have been my home alone companions for years and I really wanted to see this - First Day First Show. I pestered my wife and tormented my friends to tag along. If only I did not have some very urgent work, I would have done so. Thank God I did not. For the tickets during the weekend were three times the price and I would have regretted it. So here we go, I think Michael Bay was in a hurry to release the next version. No news nothing, it just sprang up on us. Very Bollywood (Salman) types with unnecessary drama. Long emotional scenes. Overuse of slow-motion for dramatic scenes, whereas it was more fun to watch them during action sequences. Weak plot. Terrible story. Terrible ending.The action sequence with the Chevy hatchback and the leap off the building was terribly done. Something I expect from Indian movies and not Hollywood!! And come on u couldn't come up with a better transformer than a dragon? Really? Now, are we deriving out of our own culture. Thought this was about their culture. I have not read the last transformer comic so not sure if Hasbro got something to do with this.And what's with the actors. Pathetic choice. Each one of them was terrible, except Mark. Mr Bay tried his best to make the female lead look sexy, but come on. In the end she is just what she played. A 17 yr old, awkward, not sure, to-be-sexy-or-not-to-be teenager. All through the movie she did not even throw a punch, and then right at the end she is carrying a heavy tow line to hook up to Prime's sword. Adrenaline. Maybe? But not convincing. Why can't u have a smoking hot chick with an attitude? Please note: Attitude is important. That's what Megan Fox is.What's with the new man made transformers? It was so cool to watch the previous versions or the original transformers mechanically/ seemingly-logically transforming into a vehicle or a plane or whatever. But these ones were doing some weird metamorphosis thing which honestly was pathetic... did not work for me.Weak plot. Lots of loopholes. Looks like Mr Bay is leaving a window open for the next transformers.Bad!! Bad!! Bad!!",Transformers - Age of Extinction

I also never found myself caring for the main characters, neither Mark Wahlberg's nor Nicola Peltz's and did not appreciate the part where they made Mark's character a struggling inventor i found this helped the story in little to no way. Introducing the Transformers helped very little to the dilemma of having no connection to the characters, i thought they were dull and forgettable with no real charm or character. Within the first quarter of the movie i felt as if I've seen the whole movie and everything past the halfway point seemed to be extremely repetitive, i understood it was a Michael Bay film so i expected everything that comes with a Michael Bay film, however this was a new level of cheesy dialogue that became laughable and a very poor plot.This movie is a struggle to get through with two and a half hours of mindless explosions, poorly written plot, and cheesy dialogue, not to mention the product placements...oh the product placements",Transformers - Age of Extinction

There was too much trying to be accomplished with too many characters in one movie. The humor was little. The foul language including the F word and dirty humor was a bad touch given there were a ton of little kids there and little kids are attracted to transformers because they are TOYS! It took forever to build up the story line. People were yawning and playing with their phones within the first 30 minutes. Graphics and sound were good. They would have been better if we had a theater with better sound. This was a dud. I'd rather wasted my $11 elsewhere.,Transformers - Age of Extinction

Half way through i was ready for it to be over, bored, and almost asleep. Once the fight scenes began it got much better. Mind you that was not until 3/4 of the way through. I was ready to leave at that point. The pace was just too slow. Some parts were very confusing. After the movie was finished I had many questions esp based on the previous movies. There were inconsistencies with basic ""facts"" -if you will- that have all been consistent in the previous films. Seeing as this was a continuation of the transformers movies it should have much more in common with them besides the fact that it's some of the same characters.Overall not a terrible movie but I wouldn't see it again or buy it.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

OK maybe the plot is a little bit lazy,some people says that the humans ruined the film but for me its a no.Mark walhberg was perfect nicola peltz was great and jack reynor was OK. what i liked is that we get more screen time of the robots more than the past transformers movie.there was not a lot of human screen time and i think it is perfect.yes the movie is long because its possibly Micheal bay last movie and he wants to show that he can do more and that he is the GOD OF ACTION AND HE IS.This movie does not deserve 6.4 on IMDb or 17 % ON ROTTEN TOMATOES.IT DESERVE A SOLID 80.

So, what do you really expect from a transformers movie, a gripping tale, an all encompassing acting? No, what draws you towards the ultra modern installments of transformers movies is action, loads of action and CGI, which this movie has in plenty. I am saying that when I could not watch the movie in 3D, I wish I could. It would be a waste of time to watch it on DVD. The small screen will not do justice to the awesome graphics and animation this movie has to offer. At the end of 2 hour 45 minutess I realized I did not know how time went by. No great story, no amazing dialogue, they have tried to put in some humorous lines here and there and thats about it, but you will still be entertained if you are willing to be.

Since the humor in this movie is cringe worthy,since the plot is non existent,since the characters are hollow, since the plot holes are only exceeded in number by product placements and since you say you don't care about all this because of the action, would it not be better if bay just made a movie in the style of mortal kombat video games putting autobots vs decepticons?

909,lfielding64,"(spoilers) Even in Context, its Awful",1,5 July 2014,"I recently viewed this movie with my family, and am aghast that this has been getting some of the reviews it has on this website. My mom absolutely loved all of the previous films, and she barely stomached it. I have enjoyed them as a guilty pleasure myself, but this movie is absolutely awful.The plot is an absolute joke. The beginning of the movie shows the U.S gov't eliminating Autobots, saying they have to get rid of all transformers period, but never address the elephant in the room; they're using a Transformer to do it! It feels like a rehash of the beginning of the previous movie, but they're using an outsider to hunt Autobots instead of Autobots to hunt Decepticons. Edgy! This is within the first 15 minutes of the movie, and I was already groaning. As someone else pointed out, the intro sequence showing the dinosaurs being destroyed seemed like an creation sequence for the dinobots, but in reality all it did was create an excuse to use the dinos. The whole archaeology arch seemed pointless; it felt like a vehicle to deliver the concept of Transformium, and to enable dinobots, otherwise the dinobots would have been incredibly random.And now, the acting. I like Mark Wahlberg, but he wasn't good in this movie, and neither was anyone else. Lines such as ""dad, there is a missile in the house"" bit weren't funny, and neither was the ""ignore dad and love BF"" shtick. One line that stands as the kind of ridiculous pissing contest Mark and the BF had was this line from the BF to Mark: ""I'm not helping you get your daughter, you're helping me get my girlfriend"". Some say the point of Transformer movies are the action, and yes, there is some good action in the film, but even then a lot of it is ridiculous. For example, there is a multiple minute chase scene where Mark is chased by the head of the CIA. When we finally get to see the fight scene its over in less than a minute, heck the guy dies less than 5 seconds after pulling a knife. Optimus continues to get his butt handed to him in the 1st 1/2 of the film then wins the last 1/2 of the film, but in his fight against Lockdown, he stops to save Mark, but then Lockdown stabs him, gloating about how Optimus should have worried about himself. Later, after Optimus wins, he acts like the stab is but a flesh wound which raises 3 points: How did it not hurt him more, why didn't Lockdown injure him more when he had the advantage, and why would Lockdown monologue Optimus on being tactically stupid, and then proceed to make the exact same mistake? Optimus sure didn't mess around killing Lockdown when Mark was in danger, why did Lockdown waste time? The new transformers themselves were so disappointing. They looked cool, but outside of Goodman's character, none were engaging, and thus made the fight scenes lackluster. Especially a shame when I got excited to see a samurai, but then he ended up being lame.TL;DR Plot is horrible, character dialogue is awful, and unengaging characters hamstring otherwise solid fight scenes. Dinobots were random.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
910,biprajit30,Watchable but not up to the mark,6,5 July 2014,"Transformers 4 ,the latest addition to the transformers franchise is a spectacle but it isn't a hundred percent film. Michel Bay uses very innovative and amazing ways to tell the story but doesn't fully qualifies because the storyline falls apart. Of course the graphics are amazing as usually they are and are supposed to be but Bay has let us down by not thinking too far above graphic fighting, the way transformers transform and the destruction which remained confined to one city after all we are talking about extinction like 2012.It would have been nice if the entire story revolved around 'seed',as it would have the cause of human extinction.It is a spectacle to say the least,the camera keeping pace with the superfast cars, towering camera angles as bomb explosion ripping through the sky,chaos among people, the autobots fighting for the people.The new cast is however not exciting enough as they struggle throughout the acting parts,as if no attention had been paid there. Over I wont say it is bad and Michel Bay is an amazing director with a vision but with this movie he has'nt done enough.Watch it for the visual effects if not for anything else.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
911,AlphaNoodle,Why?... (money),4,8 July 2014,"Why was this made? Well, the box office explains that single-handedly, but this film honestly feels exactly the same as Dark of the Moon and Revenge of the Fallen.I wasn't sure what I expected walking into this one, but I definitely left disappointed. The standard gripes everybody expects out of Bay at this point are are present, except only this time for nearly three hours. If I had to pick what annoyed me the most about this film, it would have to be how bored I felt despite its bloated and indulging length.The plot follows the transformers being hunted down by the US government and their efforts of survival. Similar to the previous films, the plot largely focuses around human characters that really don't warrant their screen times. But seriously, after halfway through the movie the plot serves to drive us between long action set pieces, where character actions rarely stay true to the character. It's hard to feel the intensity of these sequences when there are no breaks between them. The last 45 min should have cut at least 10 minutes of filler. The plot holes introduced through the tech in this movie are gaping, but who really expected anything in this department? The biggest improvement I enjoyed was Mark Wahlberg over Shia LeBeouf and Stanley Tucci (although at some points he was pretty much John Turturro). Far from their great performances, it makes the second half slightly more bearable, although it felt like wasted potential. The supporting cast are largely forgettable and thankfully less grating than previous characters. However, it is far from enough to maintain interest throughout the running time.I never was very knowledgeable about the original series, but I am sure what made it great it absent in this franchise. In both this film and the last 2 installments, I found myself glancing at the time to see if the movie was really that long. The action scenes are way to overblown with CGI diarrhea and slow-motion is abused way too much and mostly destroys what little tension and excitement there originally was. It doesn't feel like the transformers are really on screen because they don't feel like individual characters. Their personalities are largely constructed of infinite one-liners and stereotypes that you would expect. Grimlock and friends are after thoughts, probably there to serve as trailer-bait.This was a chance to re-ignite some passion and creativity in the Transformers franchise, but sadly Bay has decided to go with what sells (look at the box office, FOR ALL OF THEM!!!) almost like a summer tradition, tedious destruction and little to nothing in between. The worst part is even though I feel this is stronger than the last 2, it disappoints more because of the wasted opportunity for rectifying problems from the earlier installments. I honestly don't expect the other films to try anything new, so at this point it's hard to care about the sequels. They will fill seats and continue to leave fans seeking an adaptation with more skill, care and heart.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
912,Tmcglinchey23,Loved this film,10,6 July 2014,"Have to say that as an 80's child I was a massive transformer fan (animated series), I've actually just set up this account to let the movie going public know that every review from so called critics are just plain wrong, people hate Michael bay because the man makes a lot of money, the reason he makes a lot of money is because he makes fantastic action films and as I'm an 80's child where the action films where loved I love bays over the top action flicks, be your own critic and see this movie like me you can make up your own mind whether you like it or not, for gods sake it's a stupid noisey film about robots causing havoc and Optimus prime riding a dinobot into battle ,what's not to love, forget the critics snobbery go watch it and like me you'll probably have a massive grin walking out of the theatre ;)",Transformers - Age of Extinction
913,robcobb-46-940309,"Movies: Transformers: Age of Extinction, Darker and More Serious Departure From Typical Bay-hem",8,6 July 2014,"Explosions, hot women, a touch of plot and a slice of Americana in early summer, can mean only thing. A Michael Bay summer blockbuster, and Transformers: Age of Extinction does little to disappoint.Bay, the much-maligned and uber-hated director of the last three Transformers movies serves up another hulking hunk of explosions, women and inter-galactic carnage in his latest 165-minute tour de force, Age of Extinction. Set four years after Dark of the Moon, Autobots and Decepticons are now hunted down by humans after the 9/11-esque ""Remember Chicago"" mantra.At the risk of not revealing any major plot points, I will stop right here and say that if you are a Bay-hater, who lives to bash the brash master of sex and destruction, you will not be disappointed as you will be subject to Bay dangling his newest muse in Nicola Peltz who skirts around in short-shorts, tank-tops and shows plenty of leg in playing Tessa Yeager, the daughter of main protagonist and struggling inventor, Cade Yeager(Mark Wahlberg).Wahlberg, who replaces Shia LeBeouf, is a welcome and much-needed breath of fresh air in adding a sense of maturity in playing an over-protective and widowed father, as opposed to LeBeouf's neurotic and anxious Sam Witwicky, who struggled for constant attention.While many reviews of TF4 have mostly been negative—mainly due to Bay—I have to say that as a life-long Transformers fan, who grew up on the original 80's cartoon—and is very familiar with the Generation 1 canon—that I was pleasantly surprised in the more darker and serious tone that bay went in AoE. One area that I particularly enjoyed was the departure of the annoying comic relief, teenage-angst and immature sophomoric, sexual innuendos that dragged down the first Transformers trilogy.As Bay stated, TF4: AoE was the start of a new trilogy, and it clearly showed, as Optimus stated, ""the rules have changed"" In a scary and all-to-real foreshadowing of the present, you have Stanley Tucci—channeling his inner Steve Jobs—plays Joshua Joyce, head of KSI, a contractor who has developed and reverse-engineered their own Transformers, thanks to the dead remains of Autobots and Decepticons in a shadowy human-alien alliance to rid Earth of all Transformers alongside CIA agent Harold Attinger(Kelsey Grammar) and Titus Welliver(James Savoy) Sophia Myles, Bingbing Li, Jack Reynor and T.J. Miller provide passable supporting characters and background fodder in Bay's latest droid demolition derby. The Transformers franchise has never been known for it's actors, and TF4 does not disappoint in this area as most of the human cast with the exception of Wahlberg and Grammar carry an otherwise mediocre cast.The main star of TF4 is the bounty hunter, Lockdown(Mark Ryan), who manages to steal the movie as a deadly menace worthy of fighting Optimus Prime(Peter Cullen) droid-to-droid. Other standout performances was that trigger-happy munitions expert, Hound(John Goodman), Crosshairs(John DiMaggio), and of course, the Dinobots.A long-time favorite from the cartoon series, the Dinobots, Grimlock, Strafe, Slug and Scorn are called upon by Prime for reinforcements after escaping Lockdown's ship. One area that may alienate many die-hard TF fans is the lack of screen time and development given to Galvatron(Frank Welker) as he seemed more of a background and secondary character to Lockdown.While some can see this as a way to set up Galvatron's rise to power in TF5—and possibly TF6, many were hoping to see more of the re-formatted Megatron, which is a big disappointment to many fans.Once again, the special effects and action help TF4 stand out, as the last hour alone is on par—if not better than the epic metal-knuckle downtown Chicago street fight in Dark of the Moon. While TF4 is hindered by a lack of substance and plot, this is a summer action movie that prides itself on action, carnage and destruction, which it delivers masterfully. This writer will go on record and rate TF4: AoE slightly above Dark of the Moon, but below the first Transformers, thanks to it's action, special effects and jaw-dropping visuals.As stated, while the human cast is a bit flat, Wahlberg, Grammar and Lockdown are a more serious, darker and mature trio of characters that you cannot help but be drawn too, as all are fighting for their own reasons, one for the safety of his daughter in Yeager, another for his country and survival of his race in Attinger and the return the Transformers back to their creator in Lockdown.Overall, if you're looking for an excuse to blow two and a half hours in the summer and expecting to find the next low-budget, Emmy-worthy independent/art flick, Transformers 4 is not for you, as it is long, loud and proud. Critics will continue to bash and malign anything Bay touches. Make no mistake, before criticizing the ""Master of Disaster"", be sure to keep an open mind and your expectations low, as you will certainly come away deaf, entertained and awe-struck in an otherwise all-around solid action movie.Rating: 8.5/10 Follow us at @TheInscriberMag",Transformers - Age of Extinction
914,earvinlacap,"A step up from the last two, but still another Transformers Movie",6,6 July 2014,"I suppose it's reasonable to say ""Transformers 4 Age of Extinction"" is a step up from the two latest sequels, but once again, the film lacks the quality in the plot and lacks good writing. The story takes place 4 years after a destructive incident at Chicago. Cade Yeager (Mark Wahlberg) is a middle-aged mechanical inventor of many failed devices. He has one seventeen-year-old daughter, Tessa (Nicola Peltz) who he aims to enroll in college. Cade buys a scrapped beat-up junk truck and later discovers that the truck is actually Optimus prime.The title of the film is ""Age of Extinction."" At first, it wasn't clear enough to determine whether the word ""Extinction"" pertained to the humans or the Autobots. The movie contained battles, which took place on earth again, so of course one can easily apply the word ""extinction"" to the humans. But after Cade finds out that Optimus and the Autobots are hiding, I was convinced ""extinction"" refers to the end of the Autobots, not the humans. First Autobots save the humans, and then the humans turn against the Autobots. In short, the Autobots and their guns became obsolete because the KSI human organization managed to create their own transformers using the metal ""transformium"" melted from dead Autobots.And then there were the Creators. This introduction of the creators seemed irrelevant, at least to those who do not follow the Transformers story line. Yes, the Creators are the ones who have created the Autobots and Decepticons, but the two main rivalries were ultimately still the Autobots and Decepticons once again. The humans and Creators played as middlemen to dictate the next chain of events, but after all the long, dragged-out scenes of questions being answered; it is Megatron vs. Optimus once again. Megatron has pretty much died and came back every movie. ""Age of Extinction"" could have easily eliminated the first half of the movie and still could have portrayed the same message and plot in the second half.Given: the movie had brilliant special effects, digital graphics, and advanced sound but of course, what is a Michael Bay movie without unconvincing humor and poor timed dialogue. Shia LaBeouf and Mark Wahlberg have the exact same acting personality in the Transformers movies. I understand that the movie was primarily designed for viewing of the youth, but hearing a dad shouting to his daughter, ""you're grounded!"" while being chased by bloodthirsty, corrupt governmental agents working with robotic aliens from outer space, does not seem convincing to me, not one bit. The gravity and severity of the situations in the movie have so much potential to produce an exciting, action-packed film, but this ""Transformers Movies"" humor has lost me since Transformers 1. I wanted to watch this film, hoping that the change of the main actors and the different perspectives of other protagonists would make a difference. Sadly, it was just ""another transformers movie.""",Transformers - Age of Extinction
915,johndalamac1129,transformers,9,6 July 2014,So I just saw Transformers 4 today and I have to say it was spectacular. It was honestly one of my new favorites. The story line might not have been the best but It was still good. My only complaint is that the movie was a little bit long. At some point I was like OK this is the end but it wasn't and it felt like there was another hour left. I saw the movie in IMAX and 3D and it was a life changing experience. It felt like I was another character in the movie running around to save the world. The new set of actors I thought was a good fresh start I actually kinda of liked them better the previous actors. If your looking for a good action movie to have you on the edge of your seat with a little comedy I would definitely see this movie.,Transformers - Age of Extinction
916,jimbobway99,"Big on Action CGI, not so big on everything else",1,7 July 2014,"I don't understand these reviews from some of these other people. Acting Superb? Good lord, do you even know what good acting is? Good storyline? You clearly do not watch many movies. Crazy action scenes? Yes.. this I can say I agree with.The action is almost non stop. Which, generally speaking would not be a bad thing if the story line in between the action actually made sense. It seems to me that they did not agree entirely on what they story line was supposed to be.. and they also wanted to do some sort of for-shadow as the story line develops, the problem is, they really really screwed it up. It has quite a few random scenes that I wonder why in the heck they are in there other then to fill up time and put more eye candy on screen. I question entirely if they did more then a few takes on each of those scenes.I also question entirely if they even had finalized the story board before they spent a bazillion on CGI. It looks to me like they just cobbled it together and had to keep scenes in there because they just cost so much bloody money.They really need to hire a physics director or something cause at least 20 or 30 different times these transformers and humans do things which are entirely impossible with gravity and survive situations that they really should not survive. I am usually OK with a movie getting away with a few of those just for the sake of it, but this is really just to much.The story line is fragmented. Its almost entirely incoherent. The only part of the story line that actually makes any sense is the father and daughters relationship. Much of the story line seems to be left to opinion rather then actually telling you what happened. They really needed to spend time developing the story line in the early going so you understand the crazy multi-sided environment the characters find themselves in. There is almost 0 character attachment. You wont find any of these characters really super interesting or have any pen-ash about them. This is probably Whalbergs worst movie. I love his movies, and I do not see this particular movie being his fault either. Its just a shitty situation to be in and he did the best he could with it.Is it worth seeing in theaters? Yes If you like action and craziness. Is it worth waiting until your home? If you have a 3d TV sure, otherwise just forget it. This wont be worth anything when it comes to home release.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

After reading all the negative talk about a poor story plot and too many explosions, I had nearly given up on going to watch the movie.But I decided that I'll watch it anyway and form my own opinions. The movie is amazing. I felt like a kid again at the cinema. Optimus Prime can never be lame. I can't even begin to imagine how much time it took to make some of those fight scenes.You can't go watching an action/science fiction movie expecting a 'the fault in our stars' level of character and story depth. Sometimes all you want is action and cool science fiction. And this movie delivers just that.As far as the plot goes, I think it made complete sense. I see an opportunity for the movie to go in the same direction as the game. No humans. That would be refreshing.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
918,zacroche,Good...So long as you're a fan.,8,7 July 2014,"Now I'm just going to be straight with this, I bloody love this film! Hell, I loved the first three films too but I can see why lots of people hate this film and the others before it, with legitimate concerns with Michael Bay's directing skills. However, I also feel that too many people are jumping on the hateful bandwagon and just hacking into Bay through his films. Right, he's a bit of a bum and he just loves to throw controversial stereotypes all over the place but if you try very hard to see through the Bay-ness of the Transformers films, you can really start to fall in love with them.While I can accept that many people with be sat reading this thinking, ""Yeah, fall in love with what exactly?"", I'm here to say, despite all the continuity flaws, the over sexualisation of women, and the lack of character development of most of the characters, the films are incredibly good fun to watch! I mean, who doesn't love watching big kick ass robots killing each other for whatever plot reason? It's the same reason why the new Godzilla film worked so well! I guess the point I'm trying to make here is to not be so critical of a film in which is trying to entertain. Sure, you can hate on a film like Wolf of Wall Street if it's character development is crappy or if it's lacking continuity in some places, but that's a totally different genre of film. Not like I'm saying WoWS is in any way a bad film, because I'm not and nor am I saying that the Transformers films are without need of strong story and character/plot development, because I'm not, I am simply trying to say that the Transformers films are entertaining to watch and should be best enjoyed viewing them in an open minded state and with the least amount of seriousness. Now I know how brilliant and perfect it would be if the Transformers films were exquisitely written and directed, with a big concrete solid plot and a character in which we can root for other than Optimus and Bumblebee, but that's not the case and should thus be taken into consideration when reviewing this film and the three before it. They are not thrilling drama's or Oscar winning contemporary films, the are big, brash and full of explosions (quite literally) and shouldn't really be so badly slated upon because of this.To conclude, I am a huge lover of Transformers and all things nerd like and geeky and for that reason alone, I think I love the film more than the average person. With a totally unbiased and clear minded summary however I'll say this, if you; A) Don't like Transformers B) Don't like Michael Bay C) Can't look past continuity flaws D) Don't like lack of female lead characters E) Are all of the above, then you will most definitely not like this film, otherwise, I can't see why you wouldn't enjoy it. So go out and watch it for yourselves and I sincerely hope you guys and girls enjoy it as much as I did!",Transformers - Age of Extinction

All i can say is i don't regret it one bit this movie is exceptional. Although the cast didn't do a perfect job the main actors were fine. It could be improved and I'm sure they will take it under consideration before another one hits the cinema. Don't be fooled by the reviews its as action packed as it can get. Mark wahlberg did a good job with replacing shia labeouf however could polish up on some acting skills. I guess apart from that the only criticism that i could give is that the story line was exceptionally good and they have done better, but you cant always win. The special effects team did a tremendous job. Definitely recommend, if you just want to be thrilled.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

922,possum-man,A representation of everything that's wrong with Hollywood...,2,9 July 2014,"This film was almost physically painful to watch. A terrible script and poor pacing lead to a film which sorely needs an editor with hedge- clippers just to get some semblance of a cohesive movie out of it.The only saving grace is Stanley Tucci, who clearly knows he's in a stupid film and thus gives his all to create a character who may as well break the fourth wall entirely by giving knowing winks to the audience when something ludicrous is going on.Kelsey Grammar puts in a decent performance too, if only by throwing himself into the role and practically chewing the scenery when he's on screen.Mark Wahlberg delivers solid acting, as per usual, even dishing out a bit of his ""crazy guy"" act which is always good to see.Jack Reynor can't decide what accent he's trying to do in one sentence, let alone the whole film. Though he's more likable that Shia LaBeouf...Nicola Peltz is unfortunately cast as the ""Damsel in Constant Distress"" and doesn't get to show much of her acting potential.It's a shame to see a group of such decent actors burdened with a script so bad. Even Michael Bay's action scenes, although reasonably well shot, can't save this film, mainly because they become laborious and slow the film down further.

At the end of the film, I kinda just looked to my friends, and said ""Wow"" for lack of a better word. This film is epic! It has everything you could want from a Transformers film. Michael Bay and his team and the guys at Hasbro have really outdone themselves with this one. I actually loved all 3 of the previous films, but my god. This was in a different league. It was great to see some new actors as the film goes in a more dark direction. I'm not sure why people were saying that the humour failed and there was loads of humour, as there wasn't. There was a little humour to add to the dark story. The new Transformers in the film were great! Lockdown was a terrific baddie and the fight scenes were just epic. I love that they finally brought the Dinobots into this one! I've been a Transformers fan for 30 years now and I wasn't disappointed with this one. Only bad thing is that yes it's a long film, but every minute was worth it. People can hate as much as they want, but they were just (going on by other reviews i have read) watching a totally different film. I'm actually a big fan of Michael Bay films. I love action films, and he is the king of action. Pretty simple guys, if you don't like him, then don't watch his films and moan like a little girl. In closing, totally recommend this film!

924,gnmarte,Not as great as I expected.,6,10 July 2014,"Let me start by saying that I will try to be as fair as possible. I am a person that enjoys almost every movie and I did it with this one. Never the less it was filled with cheesy scenes and conversations and lots of stupidities. Let's go. SPOILERS EVERYWHEREDisrespectful boyfriend. Not so bad if you don't judge the morals of a movie. Chines or Japanese (w/e) air force is flying over the fight without a single missile, bullet or anything shot.  FORCING THE JOKES.I am the most positive person and like goofy jokes. But this was a call PLEASE LAUGH OF MY JOKE PLEEEASE!! thats never funny. The new transformers' face... to start with the Samurai... every time the transformers look more like humans and less like robots.  The way new transformers **transform**.......SUCH A TURN OFF!!, All I could think of was a Windows logo transforming into bleh. Why would you take one of the most attractive effects in the movie and make it sooo boooring and futuristic(abusing of the effect). If you have the ability to transform the thing into w/e you want... why would you make it such a crappy robot which takes me to my next point. Bumblebee's opponent is no match for him... super ultra robot ripped apart like can of beer. I was expecting a way more balanced fight but no, two shots *piece of cake*.The great Mark stop a sword swing from Galvatron and this not just stupid enough to do it once, HE DOES IT TWICE! amazing. Chuck Norris can be relegated this time. The gun sword of Mark... His bridge over troubled water. Wonders came out of that Star wars theme gun. Made by giant robots apparently with a perfect grip for human kind. Lockdown (sniperhead robot) Hidden the whole movie. He could've end it by himself. The cars were more attractive than the new Robots. No imagination. So basically we can give mass the form we want, we have auto-bots models and we will make this ones better. Not a chance. Tessa and Shane... Well, I'll just keep wishing that never happened. Shia and Megan. aaaaaaaaand Tessa is minor just to add more drama. There a scene in my head in which Shane asks Tessa to grab his Handbrake and then says ""she has the best hands"" cute ... and then CUT... Super drift nowhere. -.-' Did Optimus really flu of the last scene??? YOU FLY YOU GIANT PIECE OF CHEESE... Why didn't you before?? The city of Chigago wasn't destroyed a couple years ago?...Well, is completely fine and ready for another apocalypse. The auto-bots are jackasses. And fight all the time. Smoke cigars, get fat...sorry my brain cant have that. That goes on and on and on and on... Im just tired of typing and thinking about the movie. I watched the movie with IMAX technology that made the ride less difficult and the special effects, graphics and sound were great!! Best scene? You remember Bumblebee transforming, throwing Shia, shooting and then transforming into a car again? They did it again, but longer scene and maybe a little better. Maybe there's another scene that I may have liked more. Don't remember. It's been 2 weeks. Having said all this, I would watch the movie again, home. Or with friends if anyone buys it. Not spending money on it again. :)",Transformers - Age of Extinction
925,hisyam-sg,More than meets the sore eyes.,7,11 July 2014,"Some spoilers**It's Bayformers. I don't know why people are criticizing the film for having all the Michael Bay shticks. I went to watch the film fully aware of his directing from the past 3 Transformers film. It's a franchise that has been very successful thus far and I doubt he cares how many childhoods he ruined.And since it's a franchise, I think it is fair to compare it to past episodes and see how TF4 stands among the others. I was pleasantly surprised of how mature the film is in terms of how the characters were portrayed. Don't get me wrong, I am not saying that they are outstanding performances. What I am saying is that it is a refreshing change to have Mark Walhberg as the leading man instead of Shia Labeouf. I have nothing against the Shia but all he ever did in the past 3 films is stutter incessantly and scream, ""nononono"" and ""OPTIMUSSS!"". So you see why I'm more in favor of Cade who establishes himself as a human who actually kicks ass in a TF movie. In fact all the humans in this rendition and way more tolerable, dependable and realistic.On to the transformers: Optimus Prime is less hopeful and more brooding. Understandably because the authorities have betrayed their kind. Even after they have saved them 3 times now. Bumblebee doesn't seem to have changed at all. He still uses radio channels to communicate despite his vocal chords being repaired in the previous movie. And the others are remarkably unmemorable. Except for the samurai robot. Why does he have Japanese traits when he is an alien from Cybertron? That didn't make sense to me. Galvatron was in too few scenes. Lockdown was a discount Megatron at best.With that said, one of the hallmarks of a Bayfilm are racist and juvenile jokes. This film however, I am happy to report was much tamer when compared to 1,2 and 3. There were no hillbilly hick transformers or scrotum balls hanging off giant robots. Yes, it did have those moments when you cringe at how tacky the jokes were. And there were scenes where you had stereotyping but they were surprisingly positive in nature - if there is such a thing as a positive stereotype. ** For example when Stanley Tucci's character is in the elevator and he has to fight off two CIA agents, he gets help from his Chinese aide and the random Chinese man in the elevator who just happen to be Kung-fu experts. Could have been worse.The visual effects and action in this film was a mixed bag. There were some really intense and beautifully directed car chases and firefights, which let's admit it, Bay excels at despite what most people say. Yes sometimes you can't even see what is happening on screen with all the camera shakes and motion blurs but you get your money's worth of action in TF4. Especially when the Dinobots are on screen. Cue the explosions. BOOMS for everyone. There were some really bad CGI though in this movie, notably the 'Transformium' morphing sequences. They were poorly rendered and looks distractingly fake. Lastly, I would like to say that the film is TOO LONG. I watched the movie knowing that it would be more than 2 hours of film. But WOW, did it feel dragged out. The flip-side is that with this amount of duration, Bay did flesh out the plot a little more when there were no explosions or obligatory product placements to shove in our faces. So we get to know the humans in this film way more than necessary. Which might annoy some people who thought that with the namesake Transformers; They would actually see more of them in screen time. Personally, I feel that it could have been much tighter. Maybe less explosions? I am not one to pass up on a good BOOM but you can only get so much gratification after the hundredth explosion.Should you watch this movie? I'd say YES if you have watched the previous Transformers movies. It's more of the same but with less annoying humans and you get to see frigging DINOBOTS. A big NO if you are not a) a fan of Transformers, b)fan of Bay, C)both. 7/10.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
926,james_laucher,Review of Tranformers Age of Extinction,9,11 July 2014,This movie is really good but they could of done a better job about explaining the war that happened in Chicago. This is a very good at the new transformers that they introduce and how they introduce them i really liked that they brought Mark Wahlberg into the franchise and that they did something new to the universe it will help us all if you guys add some other well known actors/ actresses so that the public know who is in it more and that the way that the movie played out in the end it is very confusing in the end. When i went and seen it yesterday i was shocked about how it started and how it ended but it was an awesome movie in the end it was all good.,Transformers - Age of Extinction
927,cinemareviews101,"Brilliant movie! It is a bit complex. However in my opinion, it's the best one yet!",10,17 July 2014,"I give this review a 10 out if 10, not only because it is a brilliant film, but however it has a good story too it too! As a true transformer fan some parts of the film may be upsetting to some viewers, especially me. People say it's long and boring? They're wrong, very wrong. This movie is packed with loads of action and tense scenes that will put a smile on your face! Michael Bay has done a brilliant job yet again like he always does! He's a genius. The actors used in this production Re outstanding! You must watch this film! It's the 4th film, but feels like a new beginning! Loads of people have previously said that this film is too long! It is long... But it goes quick. There is strong storyline and a strong connection with the characters. You must see this! Best transformers film yet? I think so. I say this movie is the best one out of the three because it had a good flow to it and a good feel. There are many reviews that say it is long and boring, I can tell you know that it is not boring at all! The plot may be complex as there is a number of thing happening. However, once you have things sussed, it's all easy to understand from then onwards. This movie brings back some classic transformer models and some new ones too. The writers and producers do very well to keep us on our feet and excited! I believe that this movie can bring so much joy too the whole family and even one individual as well. Optumas Prime has evolved and is in better shape than previously. Even though Michael Bay has altered this fact, it can be a good change too! Bumblebee has an upgrade also. As it is a Michael bay film, there is many explosions that range from big to small. All very entertaining and brilliantly well-done! As a true transformer fan, I have the right to decide if this film is actually good. From watching the original series and old cartoon movies, I can easily that I will be watching this again as soon as it is released to DVD. This film is far from boring or long and dragging! It's a completely different story line, where, don't be scared:.. Is actually a really good thing! With new alternate villains, this movie is very enjoyable indeed. This is the longest movie out of the three previous ones. But the time will go very quick when the transformers return in this action lacked movie. Mark is an outstanding actor and is a perfect star market to the film, along with new actors/actresses and well known ones around America and the United Kingdom. One of the reasons why this movie is so good is because of the soundtrack used one again! This soundtrack it's outstanding and brilliant! The tense and action themed music brings thrills and chills down your spine as the music fits really well with the scenes and the entire film!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
928,Chad_vvvv,Produst placement and more product places,1,14 July 2014,"If you seen any of the other 3 movies you seen this one.On the other hand there is so many product placements in this movies It does it make worse. There is even a two minute long light beer ad in the middle of the movie. Of course 5 minutes later they're smashing into a Victoria secret truck. Then they are drinking some Asian brand milk. Before this there are half dozen car model ads. There are product banners on all the buildings. They Drink brand soda with crazy long camera holds. There is a product placement every 5 minutes and this is no joke.Its also really weird how they say the girl is 17 years old over and over. Then they have a ""thing"" about how its legal...I see no point in this at all.I would skip this movie. I don't plan on ever seeing another one.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
929,spiderflash,Worst movie this year!,1,14 July 2014,"Don't watch it. Extremely long, extremely boring. How many more parts are they gonna make? The story is very confusing and not well thought-through. Everything has already been chewed over and over and they keep squeezing the last bit out of the transformer-idea. The actors apparently didn't like it either because even my little sister could have done a better job. Especially the voice acting for the transformers is very weak and one just feels stupid listening to their voices. I had enough of this movie after a little more than 1 hour. That's more than 1 and 1/2 hours left which I still watched, thinking maybe something would still happen. Guess what? It didn't. Long story short, this movie is really, really bad.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
930,madmax5021,Best Transformers movie ever!,10,15 July 2014,"I've heard a lot of negative comments about this movie but I do not care what they say. This movie was not only my favorite Transformers movie, but one of my top favorite movies! It had a great story, amazing action, spectacular effects, a great score composed by Steve Jablonsky, a great cast, and best character development. I highly recommend this film. This movie was a huge step from the last two. From beginning to the end I was fascinated by the development of the story. Many have complained about the movie being too long, but really it wasn't. I happen to enjoy films that are almost three hours long or more, especially this film because it had so much going on and it didn't even feel rushed. Check this movie out for yourselves and if you don't like it oh well. No matter what people say, this will always be one of my favorite movies of all time!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
931,giovannimorlini,The Best of the Transformers Movies,10,15 July 2014,"First review for me, but I had to comment. I usually don't like the Bay movies, but with this you can clearly see that he tried his best to improve, with better actors, less comic characters and overall a better story. I really can't understand all the criticism about this movie... What did you think it should have been, Shakespeare? It's a movie with a giant robot riding a more giant robot shaped like a t-Rex!But seriously, what I really liked the best where the human and auto bots characters, which I found surprisingly deep for this kind of movie. For the sake of nitpicking, I could say that maybe the ending was a little bit too open (for sequels), but I guess this is the Hollywood way this days.If you liked the first three transformers, this is a must.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
932,shawn_308,Good graphics. Crap of a movie.,2,15 July 2014,"To long of a movie. Good graphics. Crap Storyline. Constant cutting away from fight scenes to show the humans, who should be dead early in this movie. And since when can Optimus prime fly without his flight pack.....and in outer space no less. Galvatron was under played, and he kept asking for his 'seed'😂. I believe transformers would be best leaving out the people and focusing on TRANSFORMERS!!! This movie is no different. Bay is, as always all about putting pretty faces in a movie to sell it. He just threw everything he could in this movie and said ""here like this"". And like idiots we do! Crap and more crap!!!!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
933,dipbball16,"If you didn't like this movie, you are a hater",8,15 July 2014,"I'm sick and tired off all these picky critics finding the smallest problems to complain about and downgrade a great movie. The plot was great. The way they incorporated the extinction of the dinosaurs was awesome just like the way they did the whole thing with the dark side of the moon and the top secrete Apollo mission. The movie starts off with the humans killing an autobot and using them to make their man made version of transformers my favorite part of the movie is when Optimus finds out what the humans are doing to their former comrades and he said ""autobots, I swore never to harm a human but I will kill the person responsible for this."" Or something close to that. Also I loved when the remaining 5 autobots invaded the building they were making the transformers in. They smashed in guns blazing and it just put a smile on my face. The whole movie was awesome so once again all these people who gave that movie bad reviews is a boring person. If you don't think the series got better as it went on your crazy and I can't wait until the 5th comes out",Transformers - Age of Extinction
934,rarevfx,Awesome Movie,9,16 July 2014,"I watched the movie last night as preview in Germany (official start 17. July). The sound effects were totally great and awesome -everything was vibrating! The introduction of the movie was great - it starts by being in the time, where dinosaurs live and the transformers kill them - known as ""meteors who killed the dinosaurs"". The movie is long, but it is totally worth it. The 3D is great! The movie itself it totally different to the previous ones, it is something new! Its like, being in a different movie where only the title has something to do with part 1-3.Its a must watch for every Transformers-Fan!!",Transformers - Age of Extinction
935,Minerds_84,Best Transformers yet - Read the reason for my review!,10,18 July 2014,"To start, I cannot rate this iteration of the Transformers Franchise high enough.I don't write reviews. But when I sat in the theater tonight to watch this film, I checked IMDb for the runnning time and found a whole heap of reviews completely slamming it. This film certainly seems to have copped a fair bit of flak for being the ""Worst"" transformers film yet, poor storyline, blah, blah, blah.Ease up people, I think you need to take a step back. The transformers motion picture franchise has been an adaptation of the old cartoon series, and has succeeded in being unique in its own rights. If Michael Bay and co. provided a direct duplicate of the original plot in a modern format, you'd all be slamming them for doing just that.Like him or hate him, Michael Bay is the reason this franchise has come so far. Yes, this film has its share of ""Bayisms"" - corny humour, slomo, etc, but that is part of the charm of the franchise. No one can deny the fact that these films have been successful in being entertaining audiences in an action/comedy setting whilst paying homage to their origins in both subtle and not-so-subtle ways.The film has also been slammed for using an entirely new human cast, really? You want more shia? More depth in human characters? Well okay, but I want more about the Transformers, and that's what we get here. And as for poor acting, I thought it was okay, and I would like to point out that none of the Transformers films are known for fantastic acting either.The plot in this film is fantastic, but probably requires one to actually pay attention and read between the lines a little more than in the previous 3, and maybe that leads to poor reviews by people who are unable to do this.It's ending is probably less cheesy than previous films, and is certainly left wide open for additional films, as it leaves you with more questions about the future than any of its predecessors. The culmination of the plot is set to serve as a potentially brilliant transition from their adaptation of the Gen. 1 Cartoon into their (potential) adaptation of the Gen. 2 Cartoon.If the franchise doesn't get shut down in the meantime due to poor reviews on IMDb.I encourage every fan to watch it and continue to support this franchise, but I stress again you will need to be paying attention to get the most out of it. I was, and I did.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
936,julius-gruebl-57-70265,Noooo! (Not allowed to shout in here),2,18 July 2014,"The special effects were a complete WOW. I have rarely seen such perfect animations in combination with a 3D movie. This is my first review, so I thought, starting with something good would be beneficial. Sadly, I'm done with the positive now, so let's move on to the rest. I've spent 13,50 on this movie and there aren't many things I spent my money worse on. The plot The plot, if you can say so, seems to be created by a 3-year-old with the following toys: a transformable car, an alien life-form-puppet and the memory of a dinosaur movie, seen a week ago in kindergarten. I don't want to place any spoilers in here, but if you have seen the following types of movies than you have seen this movie: Jurassic-Park, earlier underestimated man saves girl, father saves daughter, Aliens invade earth and strange guys have more feelings than people from your planet than you have seen this movie. Oh, and a bomb. Isn't there always a bomb? Furthermore the storyline has nothing, NOTHING to do with the movies before, except Bumble-Bee, Optimus Prime and the evil guy, who's killed earlier on and then - surprise, surprise - put back in game. The dialogs. I don't know if there's an order for criticism, but the dialogs sounded like they've been written by a seismograph on a container ship. Once again, no spoilers, but retranslated from German to English some dialogs ended up like this: NOOOOOO! (Slow motion, fist hitting ground); I don't like cheap copies (transformer looking at enemies); Will you be there for my daughter, forever? Forever! (I mean, what is that supposed to mean? Shall he/she say: Naah, better girls are coming?) The roles The only sympathetic guy in the movie may die early on (No spoiler). The girl has no own point in the whole story except from boobies, father/boyfriend save me and father, why don't you like my boyfriend? Mark Wahlberg does his best, but his performance (which is far above the average in this movie) can't save this movie. Best actor/role might be the guy who appears to be bad in the beginning but turns put as a nice guy in the end, #neverseenthatbefore. To sum up Michael Bay, you like explosions and slow motions, I get it. But do you have the aspirations to create a movie with more draft than my stool? If yes, you have missed this goal.

937,bap0072000,terrible story line,1,19 July 2014,"I just saw the movie and just had to post a review.I had a hard time watching the whole movie due to the pathetic story line. This was a new direction and totally unbelievable and stupid story line. I cant understand how this made it to the theaters. What a piece of crap movie. The special effects were amazing, but the characters and the absence of a story line totally ruined this so called movie. They showed a few close up leg shots of the daughter for the male teens that were placed in the movie as if someone just flipped a coin as to where to put them. there were so many inconsistencies with the other movies or common sense that it ruined the movie.

This movies costs millions of dollars and for what? Pathetic script, worst cheesiest lines and sequences ever, bad ideas, bad acting and worst of all bad directing and putting them all together. I'm sorry i watched this movie and i feel i was insulted and made laughed at for being tricked to watch this movie. After this i feel sorry for myself while the director Michael Bay laughs and enjoys his millions that we keep giving it to him. I feel dumb and sorry for myself as a viewer. This is a mockery for all us viewers who they think we are as dumb as a gorilla who likes more fireworks than what those fireworks really do for us... ( maybe not a good metaphor but you get the idea.. ) PLEASE WE ALL AS VIEWERS WE DO NOT NEED TO ENCOURAGE THIS... This means that they think about us that we are dumb and we give them money no matter what shitty movie they produce. Why you as a viewer give your bucks to them so they can make multi million dollars movies and on them make more millions. Why they have the luxury in their life from your money and make movies for you that clearly show that they think you are stupid as a viewer. Don't let them do that PLEASE.

He managed to steal 3 hours of my life with cheesy lines and all the known human clichés sprinkled around by a blind man and they felt wherever the gravity was stronger, and there isn't an intelligent situation or conversation in all the movie, so PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE never make a transformers movie again or any movie for that matter.this is all i had to say but since i'm obliged to write 10 lines of text so the review will get through ill continue writhing nonsense much like the whole movie.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
941,jian-s-qiu,not worth the time spent,3,26 July 2014,"If you want to watch this film because you are a loyal fan of the transformers, go right ahead, but you are in for a great disappointment. I just want to say to Michael Bay, stop making more of this junk and stop desecrating our memories of the beloved transformers.In this installment, you will find most of the familiar figures of either autobots or decepticons gone, and are replaced by some grotesque hybrid God-knows-where-they-come-from bots. It is good that finally the dinobots made their debut, but only as characterless hireling fighters when optimus prime (who is as great as always, largely thanks to Peter Cullen) needed extra fire powers. This franchise is going down hill ever since the battle of Chicago, and at least for that one, Michael Bay has got Shia LaBeouf as a scapegoat, but now, we know who is the real cause of the decline.At the end of the film, Megatron is reborn as Galvatron, so let us get ready for Transformers V - the final let down.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
942,btmoak,Can't say I didn't see it coming,1,1 August 2014,"I hardly know where to start. Hands down, one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my entire life. Top ten, easily. This series has never been good, but numbers one and three have been very entertaining action movies that could be enjoyable if not taken seriously. It seems that the even numbers are the ones that make me feel ill, so maybe the fifth will be good? Honestly, Mark Wahlberg and Stanley Tucci were the only good things about this film, although Tucci's character didn't make me laugh at all. Michael Bay decided it was smart to hire Nicola Peltz from The Last Airbender as a leading actress (hint: it wasn't smart). She botches every scene she's in, and looks constantly uncomfortable every second of screen time. Her boyfriend, Jack Reynor, tries his heart out, but fails miserably to give a decent performance. Every Michael Bay element is here: low camera angles, slow-mo shots of people getting out of cars, jokes that aren't funny, forgettable characters, and the ever-perplexing fact that his films focus on humans instead of the characters whose names are in the title: the TRANSFORMERS! Optimus and Bumblebee are the only returning Autobots for this one, and we get three new Autobots who weren't in the previous films. Where were they when the previous three movies were happening? I don't know, and I never will. The movie never tells us. Plot holes are everywhere. Humans are hunting down every Transformer because they think all of them are evil now for some reason, and you'd think this would prompt Optimus to leave the planet, right! Nope. He stays. For four years, running and hiding for his life from human hunters. But then (spoiler warning) at the end of the film, he flies into space! What? He could've done that the whole time! That's just one plot hole among many.However, this movie is not as bad as Revenge of the Fallen for one reason and one reason only: no humping dogs.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
943,yllemanden,Do Michael Bay not watch his movies before he release them ?,3,2 August 2014,"I really hoped this would be better than ""Dark of the Moon"", but it wasn't. Even though it was almost 3 hours, it had so many loose ends and flaws it was baffling.Below are some spoilers, and just plain stupid things about this movie.Spoiler warning:1. Michael Bay has got to stop trying making a comedy/action movie. He always do this. Tries to make a couple of characters ""funny"", but with no luck, and continue to make jokes all through his movies. A joke or two is okay, but when you try to make jokes, with almost every character, and some of them all the time (Lucas and Joshua), AND none of the jokes are funny, AND no one in the movie theater is laughing, you really need to stop. It's so bad...2. There are so many things, that are not introduced at all and just shows up, which makes the movie so unwatchable and bad. It might just be me, but why on earth did the girl's boyfriend suddenly just wait outside their house, in a car, when they are being attacked the first time ? She was reading for an exam, and really didn't look like she needed to see him at that point, and she had no time to call him when they got attacked. But yet, suddenly, out of nowhere, there is this character, in a rally car, saving them - how convenient :/3. Why on earth are the robots so human like ?! It's almost just a human body made out of metal, with a bit of color. Optimus looks nothing like what he is supposed to do (In my opinion and cartoon wise). Stop making them human - they are robots !4. Why are people in Transformer movies so durable ? They crash into buildings with raging speeds, nothing happens. Robot missiles explodes 1-2 meter away from them, all the time, nothing happens. Mark Wahlberg fights Lockdown of all robots, 1 on 1, and survives. He can hit a target miles away, but scratching Wahlberg with his gigantic swords/weapons, 1-2 meters away from him, with numerous tries - nope, not gonna happen :/5. Megatron becomes Galvatron, and you see him for less than 4 minutes the entire movie !?!? :/6. ""Oh, we are about to get our asses kicked. Hmmm, how convenient. I think there are 4 Dinobots in here, which probably will fight for me, if I fight one of them for 20 secs..."" Really ? Again, no introduction what so ever, just really convenient...7. Joshua tells the regular Autobots, that his version of robots are superior to them, which we see when they transform, and reassemble when being shot at. Somehow, this only works in the middle of the movie, since the last 40 minutes or so, they can't do squad compared to regular Autobots. There is, according to the movie, about 50 new robots under the command of Megatron/Galvatron, AND Lockdown. But there are, what, 6-7 Autobots, and 4 Dinobots, and of course Wahlberg and his crazy insane gun, that do more damage that any other robot weapon, and then they just kill everything, even though the new robots are supposed to be superior ? Again, gimme me a break...8. I was about to puke when Nicola Peltz said: ""You are my hero dad..."", so Armageddon 15 years ago...9. The elevator scene, really !?!? It makes no sense. Why did they just stand there ? And again, how convenient, that the Chinese guy could kick ass :/ Maybe the stupidest scene in the movie...10. Why is it so easy for Wahlberg and other humans to get into buildings and spaceships without any effort at all, and without being noticed at all.11. Why is it, that a girl in high heels can outrun 4-5 robot dogs in a spaceship ?12. How did Optimus get fixed ? Lucas was going to get some stuff to repair him, if I'm not mistaken. They get attacked when he gets back, and then Optimus is fully functional, attacks everything and just drives by a WHITE TRUCK, scans it, and get his original look back, and is apparently a-okay. Can he auto repair, or am I missing something ?Ofc, some of my points are smaller that others, but this runs throughout the whole movie IMO. So many flaws and mistakes, and loose ends, that I could continue forever...On the positive side, Lockdown was cool, and the effects as always. But the plot, the whole ""bringing the story together"" was so bad. It's like no one have seen it before it was released.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
944,keiwaiyin,Save you time on something better.,1,11 May 2015,"Plot/Writing 5/30 At a Transformers movie, at least directed by Micahel Bay and his fellow writer Ehren Kruger, you didn't expected there's a plot or any breakthrough. What you get in here is the writing tied in with explosion, racist dialouge, and a random hot girl and her little boyfriend. These are the bad thing that's unnecessary. But there's also some good thing, or some improvement. There's a little emotion in Transformers, but I must they failed to do so. And what about Optimus Prime saying ""I'll kill you'? Optimus Prime would never think about killing a human right? What happened, there's nothing heroics on Optimus this time. But at least they try to put emotion at a Transformers. But aside from that and the slightly darker tone, Transformers are still very ""ROBOT"". They talk and walk slowly, unnaturally, stupidly. They just don't interact with human and other Transformers. Bumblebee still can't speak and act like a stupid kid, which is very annoying. Acting 2/30 This movie is designed for Michael Bay amusement only, and what Michael bay care about is explosion and hot girl. So acting wasn't something he's care about. Though I found Stanley and Mark acting enjoyable. Direction 0/30 This time, there's a lot of technical mistake. Especially the ""Hong Kong"". As a Hong Konger who live in H.K. born in H.K, I must say, THIS IS NOT HONG KONG. 6 digs phone number, Simplified Chinese, and ridiculously Wu Lung in the back of the peak. If you feel these are not necessary as you're not live in HOng Kong and you won't notice, what about Chicago landmark Sears Tower in Hong Kong. Did Michael Bay noticed this? Even if he doesn't, did he noticed there's a random guy appear in the shot? There are a lot if mistakes happened in this movie, and its really disturbing. Visual Effect 6/9 The action and visual effect are getting more and more incoherent. I just doesn't understand why Michael Bay didn't notice all those explosion are just a bunch of firework crumble together. CGI rendering is pretty good though. Did I like this movie?

You guys are so critical and judgmental when it comes to Michael Bay and his Transformers series. Instead of looking for bad things within the movies, lets try to appreciate and point out the positives on both the movie and director. For starters Michael Bay is the only director who has dared to take on such an iconic childhood memory and make it enjoyable and action packed group of movies that has satisfied both child and adult age groups. The crew he has assembled have made such a jaw dropping and visually capturing movies of this era. They have set the bar high for all directors/movie crews. We are always asking an action packed movie of the summer each year, but some of you guys are too busy picking out all of the cons to the movies instead of giving them a chance and realizing the beauty that is right in front us. Honestly how can you ask for something and then when it is given to you, you want to throw it away without embracing and appreciating its value first.

This movie like the previous installments of the transformers franchise contains slow motion, terrible action scenes and other Michael Bay BS. Aside from the terrible action scenes and blatantly obvious product placement the supporting actor Jack Reynor has the worst Irish accent I have ever heard. I am from Ireland and I could not even understand the majority of his conversations. The supporting actress on the other hand is the best part of this crappy movie, she is an absolute babe. She was the entire reason I was able to stay strong (and hard) and watch entirety of this movie. I am not even going to mention Mark Wahlberg's attempt of acting as a father apart from saying it was horrendous. In conclusion do not see this piece of crap movie if you are unhappy with your life because it will just push you over the edge and will make you want to commit suicide.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
951,kevin-nguyenba,Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014),2,25 August 2014,"I went into the cinemas watching this movie with no expectations as I know movie franchises often get dull and boring after the second sequel and I was right, all the concepts covered were repetitive and not original.The idea of making humans suddenly go against the Transformers with so much hatred after the Autobots single-handedly save them several years ago in Chicago, is absolutely joke. There is no back story of how the Decepticons and humans (some from the corrupted US Government, anyways) become allies just adds to the frustration of the movie.They also went cheap with the transformations with many not shown on screen and most of the Decepticons transformation animated like liquid-water cubes being less complex and easier to pull off. Apparently they hired an offshore special effects company to do all the CGI as it was deemed cheaper. Disappointments left-right-and-centre from there. Michael Bay ought to be court-marhshalled for this...he also stuffed up the recent Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles remake too. They have made too many Transformers motion picture movies yet there is still two more installments left. Stop already, please.If you go in watching this with no expectations then it is still mindless entertainment but overall, this movie is a joke...nothing compared to Part 1...not even close.Cheers",Transformers - Age of Extinction

953,darraghgillou,Worst movie I've ever seen.,1,31 January 2015,"Honestly there wasn't a single thing I liked about this movie. The plot, cast and dialogue were abysmal. I would give anything in order to unsee this monstrosity that barely passes for a film. Easily Mark Wahlberg's worst role in anything ever. The fact that this was allowed to be made just completely baffles me. I mean, how can someone go from being in The Departed and end up in this piece of crap excuse for a movie? I went into this movie with the lowest of expectations and yet I was still extremely disappointed. It sickens me that I contributed an amount of money towards the makers of this movie. I can wholeheartedly say, without doubt, that this is the single worst film I have ever seen.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

So when the movie first came out my excitement was unbound.I'm not gonna lie. I even liked the first two movies. But what the freak is this..??It's like when they were making the movie they just had three items in their checklist. 1. A really good actor. 2. A hot girl. 3. Explosions, lots of them. check, check, check. Done. Here's a crap, now waste your money all you want as we fill our pockets.It's like they don't even give a crap about the legitimacy,content,logic,reason etc etc. Just make up craps as you go along.And that awkward moment when after finishing the movie you keep wondering where you have seen the lead female actor before, daughter of the protagonist, and then you suddenly realize it's the girl from that god awful, disgrace to the original series, crappy movie called the ""The Last Airbender"" from f*****g A*****e ""M.Night Shyamalan"".",Transformers - Age of Extinction

956,invictus_xd,Good Movie!,9,16 September 2014,"In my opinion this movie was actually very well done! Like the 1st, 2nd and 3rd movies this one actually surprised me to say the least. There might be a couple spoilers, but nothing serious in my opinion in fact I don't count them as spoilers but just in case someone is picky, you have been warned. 1)They actually gave the movie a new and fresh storyline, there was legitimate struggle between the good, the bad and the evil. They really set the tone at the start as something fresh happening, the 3 prequels are the thing of the past and took it in a whole new direction. There was good progression of the characters. Although some were suddenly introduced it was done right given the scenario (i.e. Boyfriend meeting for first time out of the blue). It really showed how power hungry everything and everyone was. Even down right to the KSI inventor had a bit of character development and that is not a common thing in movies now days. 2) Yes they had explosions and cool fight scenes, but honestly it makes the movie much more true to its Michael Bay movies. But the nice thing about this one I found was that the fight scenes were balanced, they had a specific time and place and didn't overwhelm the entire movie. There were good moments of distress and sadness to go with epic fight scenes. 3) Honestly, there isn't a whole lot bad with this movies, I don't know why people get all butt-hurt when a transformers movie doesn't follow the ""comic"" or TV show... Honestly if they did that then it would be pointless as you would know everything, and you can just watch or read the original. I love it when Directors give movies their own twist or tweak originals since it makes it different and I get to see new content or the same content under a new light. Which is why I love these Transformers movies... Yes all of them, 1, 2, 3, and 4, are all good. Two and three do not suck. 4) There were some obvious visual and factual flaws to be seen through out the movies but I am not picky, it does not phase me in anyway. (i.e when the lady said ""Carbon dating has proved this metal to be 65my old""... That is incorrect, Carbon dating does not date metal, only organic ""CARBON"" sources and is only accurate to 50,000 years, nothing beyond let alone million years.)5) This movie also had some genuine funny moments, and the dialogue was GREAT! Especially the KSI scientist he was very funny with his sarcasm. And the characters/ cast was great! They all did a good job, and played their roles well, maybe if they got more time to develop them overall it would have been nice but oh well. 6) Only other thing, that I wish they would touch upon was to answer questions that arise through out the story rather than leaving them blank or alone. But in a sense it works because it lets the audience imagine the beginning and the end, let the imagination do some work. Story: 4/5 Cinematics: 5/5 Action: 4.5/5 Dialogue: 4/5 Overall: 8.7/10 (I loved it personally and would recommend it to anyone who is not nit picky and does not want to see an iteration of the originals, definitely took a unique direction)Hoping that Transformers 5 will bring Megatron back to full form, and this new cast will meet Shia La Beouf from the 1st three Transformers. And each of the main characters can be associated with a Transformer like how Shia was with Bee.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
957,thembile-jj,Most Maddening Transformers Movie Ever!!,3,18 September 2014,"This to me is the most terrible Transformers movie I have ever had the displeasure of seeing. Over 2.5 hours of what seemed like mindless orbital bombardment with enough explosions to last a lifetime of movie-making. None of the characters are developed enough for a viewer to care in the least bit about. And Tessa, is portrayed as a helpless girl who can't even get out of a non-moving car as if cracking a window or swinging a car door open is rocket science screaming all the way to the alien ship. I've never heard so many jokes that weren't funny in one movie. The action sequences are horrendously scattered all over the place and I don't even recall any one really enthralling fight. Oh, and Optimus was just so weak, it was maddening. Half the time I was checking how much time was remaining before it ends because sitting through the end was such a pain. Micheal Bay has successfully killed the Transformers Franchise.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
958,wernerros,Good start of the new trilogy,8,21 September 2014,"Hi everyone,First off let me say that I disagree for the largest part with most of the bad reviews people have written. And don't take movies TOO serious, the whole point about movies and why we love them is because things happen in the movies that don't or can't happen in real life. I always try to use this way of looking at movies:First watch the movie, do you like it? Then read the book or watch the series afterwards. Don't read the book or watch the series first because it will ruin the movie for you every time because it will always miss certain details.I have read some reviews that comment of the fact that there is a too large of a action part (in the last 1,5 hours?). Well if you hate that then why the F are you even going to the movies for a Action/Sci-fi/adventure film with the focus on action. Don't hate the movie because of your own damn fault of not being able to filter out the kind of movies you regularly don't want to see.Also people have been hating on the fact that there is not a very good story, well yes I have to agree a for a small part on this. For example I don't like the big changes in the cast in the sentence of autobots (like killing ratchet and such). And yes it appears to be a smaller story line then the last trilogy but it's not for nothing that this will probably become a separate trilogy. If you want a story either go back to the first trilogy or go watch the child's versions that are made in series and go enjoy those, because this movie was already 2 hours and 45 minutes(including credits) there for if they would add a bigger story line it would not be a good item to show in a cinema or at the movies simply because people don't go to movies often if they take longer then 3 hours. Now on to my actual opinion. I love the movie, love all the action scenes love the cast. Sorry about the fact they had to change the whole cast but like the change they brought and adapted to it. I hope they keep the current cast intact and bring the next movie with around the same amount of action but if possible a slightly bigger story line. I have seen the movie 3x in the cinema now and even more not counting the times after that. In a nutshell: Can't wait for the next one. Michael Bay YOU MAKE AWESOME MOVIES. Just recently searched your portfolio and projects you made and I noticed that I have seen and loved all of your movies yet. Hope you can keep this up!:)First review I have written here on IMDb, hope you guys can do something with it.Werner,",Transformers - Age of Extinction
959,Elias-Elias,Excellent!,10,22 September 2014,"I went to see Transformers 4 with the expectation of awesome action, and boy i was not disappointed!** The action was amazing **, the comedy was funny most of the time and the music was in the right place throughout the scenes. So many people are bashing this movie for various reasons without realizing that - it is a movie about BIG robots smashing each others to pieces. If you are expecting a love story, or whatever then there are plenty of other movies for just that. This is Transformers.I even enjoyed the story and the characters. Optimus Prime is a real piece of art. Also Mark Wahlberg did an amazing job here, and he managed to actually impress me. I would be pleased if he returned for Transformers 5.The runtime of the movie though could have been a bit less, as there are some unnecessary scenes in the movie, however it doesn't overdo it.A real piece of art!

960,dwyse77,Who wrote this?,2,22 September 2014,"I am going to do what most people do and start by saying that I grew up a Transformers fan. But believe when I say that I hold no loyalties to a franchise just because I liked them as a kid. That being said, I thought the first two were awesome. I even thought that Dark of the Moon was awesome. But this one? Who wrote the plot, the script, the WEAPONS??!!?! It's like the director let his 18 year old kid come with the entire script. I will break it down in multiple segments:1.) Displaying thinking machines like they are adolescent kids. WHAT!?!?! It has a brain that can make millions of calculations a nano-second. Take our best computer, times a thousand, and that wouldn't probably even scratch the surface. Yet they are portrayed as children, getting upset, thinking about not following orders, ARE YOU SERIOUS!!?? Optimus at one point, acts like a little kid who got his feelings hurt. The Dino bots appear like dinosaurs, that doesn't mean they think like them. They have super computers for brains, C'MON!! No realistic approach was taken to properly represent what sentient machines would behave like. They would have a consciousness that extends way beyond our own. It has the capability to transform. That means knowing where all your parts are going in the transition period from one shape to the next and also making calculations to correct trajectories for falls, and grabbing people, and so on. Yet they act like a disorganized pack of frat boys. This was written by an 18 year old.2.) Not even a remotely believable story line or script. Autobots saved the world (in the last movie), not a city, or a country, THE WORLD!!!! People wouldn't turn around and hunt them even if it was 5 years later. Good lord, they have guns bigger than battleship main deck guns. And the portrayal of the ones left was hideous. You mean to tell me that the ones that had the best combat prowess from the previous movies all managed to get killed and the no-name idiot ones managed to survive? Save Bumble Bee. Why would they split up when they have a huge power advantage as a group. Makes no sense. Oh, and Optimus can fly? Why the f**k didn't he just leave the planet or keep continuously acting like he can't fly. This was written by the same 18 year old. Oh, and the I-think-I'm-a-badass- because-I-can-drive kid with the bad Irish accent? Mark Wahlberg's arms were bigger than this kid's head and he trash talked him? Again, written by an 18 year old who is trying to do the kids-this- generation-have-spunk thing. No you don't, you're still stupid, smart phones don't make you smart. And Mark Wahlberg calls a 40mm cannon round a mortar shell. What idiot on the movie set didn't say excuse me Mr Dipsh*t that is not a mortar round (talking to the director). And why do big giant alien robots still use conventional gunpowder ammunition when some clearly have energy weapons which have no magazine. Written by idiots.3.) The weapons. Wow. A sword that somehow has a trigger mechanism in the top of the hilt so that it can be fired like a gun. I'm looking at a picture of it right now as I type this because it is in my sidebar. REALLY. So you mean to tell me that when the big-ass alien robots were making it they thought: hey, why don't we make a sword that a smaller humanoid creature could hold and fire like a rifle? We won't ever have a need for this feature but, what the hell, short wimpy humans might so let's do it anyway. And he's going to look really stupid while doing it but that's the point, right? Also, who the f**k aims these guns? Oh, that's right, giant robots, with huge super computer brains, stupid me. They can't hit sh*t. We have human targeting systems in our jets and we are 10x more accurate. I mean they can transform, and fall down a building, and manage to catch and protect falling humans all at the same time, but THEY CAN'T AIM A DAMN CANNON TO SAVE THEIR LIVES. I mean there is a scene where Galvatron fires a volley of 6 missiles and can't seem to land a single one and that's at almost point blank range. I know it's supposed to be a movie. BUT FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THINGS, MAKE IT SEMI-BELIEVABLE. Give it some plausibility. A bunch of giant alien machines (I can't accentuate that enough, MACHINES) that can't hit the broad side of a barn, just plain sucks. Make the rounds hurt less but make them accurate, or something.Oh, and don't let your 18 year old kid write the plot, script, or whatever. Tell him to sit down, stick his head in his smart phone, and go to school.No more sword-guns. Stupid.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

All in all I spent more than half the movie trying to understand where it was going and praying for it to end.i really liked the movie it have a lot of action and guns fight but at the same time it didn't hold my attends like the other three movie of transformers. but ill rate it 9.9 for the acting and movie. i waiting to see if there going to be another transformer movie after this one .i would like to see what they would to in this next on if there going to be a next one. will they be using the same character for the next movie or will they use different one like they did in 3&4 . why not use the same people in all the movies. why wasn't the army in the one i was very surprise to see they was not in the movie i was like WHAT...,Transformers - Age of Extinction
962,Hay28,Awesome movie!,10,3 October 2014,All the repetitive annoying comments how people hated it and how it sucked. It was not long and had enough action to sustain enough interest to keep it going. I wish they did not use mark as his acting sucked. The new characters did not carry the same momentum. I wish bay had at least brought Shia and the other past members back. Megan fox could be left out as she isn't a good actress to begin with. I hope in the new one you plan on bringing some of the old team back together. It was depressing Sam wasn't even brought up once as if the auto bots had forgotten about him.

The acting is just horrible, especially Tessa. *SPOILER* When Optimus and Gabletron(whatever) were fighting and the giant ship came and picked up Optimus and the car, the dad told Tessa to break the glass. Her response was, ""I'm trying"" while TAPPING the glass. There was no emotion, not even an attempt to 'break' the glass. I miss the old cast of Transformers. The writers could have at least put in some of the old characters to help instead of a brand new cast. Also in the third Transformers, wasn't Optimus's arm cut off?

964,samcarlyp,Don't get your hopes up but don't let them entirely down,6,7 October 2014,"I am not an expert movie reviewer and this is my first one. However, I am confident enough to give my opinion on it. This movie is confusing as hell. The transition from the last movie to this was terrible, probably the worst of the franchise. No more Shia, the terrible Rosie girl, and definitely no Megan(just to throw it in there to those who miss her like I do). By the end of the movie you will most likely have a lot of questions and especially during the movie. I give tons and tons of credit for the graphics and how real the bots look but that doesn't make up for the plot. I felt like the movie just led up to nothing. This movie was just as predictable as the last movie and the first one. The second movie was my favorite because of the plot and I had no idea Optimus was coming back to life.It needed more delicate and quick to the point scenes but the movie takes forever to get to it. Every time a character was endangered I had no excitement whatsoever. The was just simply put, dead. Who ever this new girl is she is annoying as a pimple on your nose. She irritated the crap out of me. Megan Fox was the best out of the three girls in the franchise. She fit perfectly because she looked hot but tom boyish at the same time. The other two girls looked like damn models who would be the first ones killed during a scary movie because they were having sex. Megan kept it sexy but classy at the same time. By the next movie, if Mark stays, the daughter should graduate and go off somewhere with her boyfriend while a new girl is a hot engineer who falls for Mark. The movie was long for nothing. If the plot was better, shorter but precise, and less confusing, this would have been the best movie. Get rid of the girl and add a better ending and TA DA! The movie would have gotten at least an 8. Watched once and will never watch again. Hopefully the next one, we see a movie filled with action and dramatic and emotional scenes. This movie displayed no emotion. Well, I felt bad for Optimus because he is the only bot who gets attacked the most.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
965,jonathan-p-tardif,better than the first 3,7,7 October 2014,"I don't normally bother writing reviews, but after reading some of the ""top"" reviews here, I felt the need to put in my two cents. This movie was what the previous 3 should have been. It was far from perfect, but it actually felt like a movie about the Transformers. I loved the series as a kid, dabbled in the comics, thought the 1st and 2nd Michael Bay movies were OK and sub-par and thought the 3rd sucked.This movie started slow, building up a story on the new human characters that replaced Shia and company. But then, this movie actually became about giant, transforming robots! Which is what some reviewers are upset about: it wasn't Shia LaBeouf with guest stars the Transformers, but whatever.The action scenes were a little more toned down from what Michael Bay has been throwing in the previous movies. There wasn't as much excessive explosions as I've come to expect from Transformer movies, which I found relatively pleasant.The robot-on-robot was actually watchable: no mashing together various CGI robots with nauseating after effects. You can actually tell which robot is which during fight scenes.Speaking of which, they sleeked down the transformers so they looked like, well, Transformers, instead of jagged looking robots someone put together in the garage with spare car parts. They also dialed back on the harshness of the Autobot/Decepticon voices: very easy to understand the voices of ALL the voice actors, not just Peter Cullen and Frank Welker.While you have a lot of comedic interactions between all the characters, it's actually enjoyable, unlike a lot of the raunchy, disruptive, teenage garbage that got worse with every previous movie. Which, again, some of these other reviewers thought made the prior 3 movies...The movie IS long, somewhere around 2 hours and 40 minutes, but it really didn't feel that long. It was easy to follow, more or less kept moving along at a decent pace and kept my ADD rattled brain attentive.I kinda wish I saw this movie in the theaters.

969,tyler3812,God awful movie,1,31 October 2014,"Transformers Age of Extinction was truly the ugly step-sister among the Transformers series. Although the movie had amazing graphics, special effects, thrilling action scenes, and a terrific cast, it was all ruined by the overcomplicated plot of the story as well as the designs for some of the new transformers. The movie has multiple sub-plots and unnecessary scenes that drag the movie along for almost three hours.One of the movies initial problems is the overcomplicated story line and multitude of subplots. Generally most movies have one major villain accompanied by a sidekick and a few minions; that's not the case for this movie. There are three different major villains in the movie, which each had to be defeated; before long it became quite redundant. This caused the length of the movie to seem almost infinite, I literally sat in the theatre praying the movie end; sparing me from further torture.The worst thing about the movie by far was the design of the new transformers. We've all got a pretty basic understanding of how transformers work. They're giant metal alien robots who can transform into various vehicles. Essentially all the parts they use to transform are a part of that transformers body. That's no longer the case for this movie, the transformers are wearing clothing; for example one of them wears a jacket and the other a hat. It completely ruins the idea of Transformers. It doesn't end there; they really sealed the deal when they decided to give the robots accents. It's ridiculous; they are robotic aliens from Cybertron and they have Japanese and county accents. I'm confused are they interplanetary aliens or just illegal aliens? All in all Transformers Age of Extinction was an abomination. The movie was overcomplicated and way too long, and the new transformers were an utter disgrace. This movie isn't worthy of the name Transformers, it's like one of those off-brand items you see when you go to the store; it's more like Transmorphers.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Mark W, was horrible and the fact that everybody in the movie is a model fits Michael Bays other films. I grew up watching Transformers and there are so many better story lines that they can go with.

971,tstevens91,Worst Transformers Movie Yet...,2,6 November 2014,"I have been a fan of the Transformer series since if first came out in the 80's. I was a kid who owned the toys starting from Gen 1 and followed the comics as well as the cartoons for many years. With that being said it is probably obvious that I have hated what M. Bay has done to the franchise through his movies, even though I keep hoping he will come around OR his bosses will give another producer a go at it. I will not argue that the films make money. Some people will go see anything with special effects and big explosions; which Mr. Bay specializes in. Also, Age of Extinction was geared largely to the Chinese population and there are well over a billion of them, so what is the surprise that it made a killing in Asia. The fact is that Bay could not stray much further from the original storyline, and couldn't ruin the series much more than he has. The films are not making money due to his talent, they are making money because they are based on the Transformers. If Bay could actually make a decent movie outside of explosions, special effects, and poor storyline and dialogue; then the movies would likely make much more money then they have. I am so glad that my friends and I paid less than two bucks for it instead of paying for it at a theater. The only parts of the movie that justify the cost is the amount of time it kills (even though you find yourself asking for the two+ hours of your life back by the end), the action is kind of cool (gets tiresome toward the end as well), Mark Wahlberg is so much better than scream queen Shia, and..... that is about it. They storyline is full of holes, questions, and what seems like rubbish nonsense, or mistakes due to messing with the original and characters, the movie is too long and starts to bore you even with the fight scenes you start wondering if something of importance is ever going to happen. The character development is weak, the daughter-BF relationship drama is irritating and distracting from the main story, and once you start getting tired of it, it never seems to end. The movie series started out pretty decent with the first film and has constantly declined ever since, with Age of Extinction being the worst yet. I cannot believe that any real fan of the franchise, for all that it is, beginning from its roots, can actually like this film. Nor can I believe that anyone who likes quality films with actual plots that you can follow and characters you can root for, would like it either. If weak dialogue and characters, fancy special effects, and constant explosions for two hours are your idea of a good, quality film, then you might like this one. Mark W is a nice change from Shia L, and the special effects are the only reason I gave it two stars.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

Wood Jr. as one of the worst directors of all time. This movie is SO bad, that halfway through I just could not stand to sit and take the torture anymore. I read about Guantanamo prison using music to torture inmates....they should use this movie instead. It is that bad. You start to realize just how awful it is when Mark Wahlberg is standing on his countryside porch when: queue sappy music....and queue the most fake shooting star you've ever seen! In fact there are so many bad sappy scenes in the movie that you just start to roll your eyes. I don't know what Bay is doing, but he is clearly have illusions of grandeur when it comes to directing, storytelling, and directing. I was actually watching this with a friend and I became so embarrassed that I just had to stop the film. Now before you say I can't give an honest review because I didn't watch the whole movie, then I triple dog dare you to watch it all the way through sans 'Clockwork Orange' style eyelid modifications. You too would be yelling for it to stop. I have never seen a movie worse than this and I don't want to. Don't waste your time with this garbage and if Bay decides to direct some movie, it should maybe be some animated cartoon for 3-4 year old children.

Michael bay proved that he is not director stuff. The film is simply a mixture of glamorous cast, unnecessary noises,super explosions and a weak storyline. The director has taken the audiences for granted and bent history as well as story line too much. There are unbelievable turn of events and poor manipulation of characters of the story which makes you want to leave after two hours of the movie which is almost three ""long"" hours. The only thing that i really appreciates the vfx team including Michael bay who made some exceptional cgi work into this movie. I gave six out of ten only for the CGI. Overall this was a very lazy ,illogical and purely business point of view film from Michael bay and executive producer Steven Spielberg who i think didn't see the film at all.. please don't waste your time if you are not really into CGI .. because that is the only thing worth it...",Transformers - Age of Extinction

It was over 2.5 hours of no plot, stupid humour, blatant product placement and redundant explosions. I couldn't even fall asleep because of all the loud explosions! By far the worst 2.5 hours spent that summer.

Very nice CGI and explosions but overall inconsistent plot, bad acting, bad dialogue, bad directing. To say that the scenes feel disjointed is an understatement. And the acting and lines of Shane Dyson (Jack Reynor) is so bad it made everyone cringe. And the noble Optimus Prime is gone, replaced by a maniac who'd threaten to murder those who wouldn't help him.If we didn't already spend money on soda, pizza, and popcorn and the date, we would have walked out of the movie. It's that bad. I had been a big fan of the Transformers since I was a kid. Was. Michael Bay has made me hate the franchise more and more with every succeeding movie.

They never mention a single word about dinosaurs or extinction in the movie at all. Unless you wanna 'judge a book by its cover', your asking for a big disappointment. Basically It's plot is weak and has a lot of problems. Great movie for VFX but terrible movie if your looking for a good story.

I liked the plot, the story, yea, everything with the movie.The sounds in the movie is great in my opinion, the effects is the same. Same for the fighting scenes, it doesn't get too messy! Which is extremely great. And they do not over- react with the fighting scenes (example: Optimus takes down 10 decepticons/enemies alone, without getting a scratch, this does not happened in any of the movies btw). The plot has a few holes in it, but rather than that there's no real problems with it (for me, or what I find).

Not as funny as the first but better in other areas.Those who could not bear the first 3 films due to action overload on the fighting scenes (too loud, too shaky and too much to take in) will be pleased this has been scaled back. But the real good thing about this film is that it brings my childhood back to me. I'm not going to pretend I'm a professional film critic and talk about scripts, editing, directing etc. There's enough pretentious wannabes on here to do that for me. But this film brought my childhood back because it had everything that I loved as a child; autobots, deceptacons, a debut for the dinobots..... Yes dinobots!!

This horrible mess of plot holes overblown effects and total inconsistency. First of all what happened to Sam Witwicky. They didn't mention how the autobots left his side at all.I mean they plop a brand new character right in the 4th movie with no explanation of Sams absence at all.Second of all overblown amounts of special effects. I'm all for special effects but this movie is an overblown effects mess. Now all action movies need action this movie made an action movie all right but with little backstory it's just that a big near 90 min. fight.The next thing wrong with this mess is that they said oh this movies about the Dinobots they were on screen maybe for ten minutes. Its inconsistent with the name which shows this flawed Michael Bay messups ultimate flop.There is not much example of ""Extinction""at all. The Movie Transformers Age of Extinction is a horrible messed up overblown special effects mess My rating out of 100%. 15.1% with a generous .1% compared to metacritics 32%.

987,djcoolmaster,The end of Transformer sequels?,1,25 April 2015,"First of let me say, i really like the Transformer series. Even though the stories aren't written well, for an action-packed movie it doesn't need to be.The stories of the first 2 movies lined up nicely for anyone that likes to have a grip on the progression through a series. Sam being the main character, main enemy being Megatron (aided by the Fallen in the 2nd movie), just your normal Autobot vs Decepticon movie. The 3rd movie however didn't made any sense to me following up. Megatron being defeated and having to flee, needing a new plan to take on the Autobots was the end of the 2nd movie. In the 3rd he then again teams up with another Cybertronian, Sentinel Prime, this was all planned well before the first 2 movies though. However making about 200 Decepticons hide on the moon then having them come to Earth and hardly seeing an actual war go on was weird. Now the things that gets me is the transition from 3 to 4. End of the 3rd the Autobots save Earth, everything seems fine.Now to the part of this last sequel, if you can call it a sequel. It may just have been an entire spin-off. First off, I get that the main character from the first 3 movies are replaced. Sam might have turned to a normal live for the better. With the introduction of this new batch though, there is not a single thing I could find that got me interested in them and I really tried. I like seeing Wahlberg in movies, just think this movie was written to suit his strongest acting quality though: Being funny. In the first hour I could laugh at the witty dialogs they were having, but at the end all I seem to remember is getting annoyed by the constant wanting to be funny lines or actions from the characters in this movie. I missed having an actual story to follow or a purpose to root for. Seeing the Dinobots I got my hopes up that much more would be uncovered about the past of the Autobots, instead all you learn is that the Creators want their stuff back. Since the 3rd movie, it has not been about writing a plot, its about writing action with many holes to fill in. This does not fulfill my need of a story that grips you, pulls you in and makes you eager for the next movie.It's a thing nowadays though with movies that become a series. They got a fan-base, got a few elements they think matter most for the viewers (nowadays graphics and the same protagonist group), then however forget to fill in the story, the character and such things.Accepting this as movie- or series-enthusiasts will just be a dark road ahead.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

993,danielyoung,"Michael Bay is not only targeting teens, but also the Chinese market",6,10 July 2014,"With a brand new cast and a large part of the story involving China, plus the hiatus of three years instead of two between previous parts of the franchise, the fourth installment of Transformers appears to be a reboot. Well, not really.Transformers 4 is no different from the previous three parts and joins the list of movies that are catered to the taste of teens: Harry Potter, Twilight, Percy Jackson, Beautiful Creatures, even The Hunger Games, not to mention a dozen of fairytale adoptions. Yes, the lead role played by masculine Mark Wahlberg is no longer a teenage boy, but a hot and perpetually leg-baring female, prolonged fighting scenes that don't need much of a storyline to buttress are a permanent part of the ingredients.For a brief moment, Michael Bay seems to have returned to the style in his early movie-making days. A military operation is neatly rendered in the beginning: a team of agents raids a shipyard with highly coordinated efforts. It's delivered through clean-cut shots and a smooth transition of scenes, accompanied by fast-paced and gritty music in the background. (Remember the part in 1996's ""The Rock"" when marines storm the weapons depot?)Well, that doesn't last long. A while in, Bay's usual tricks come in: excessive car chasing, bombing and explosions that leave almost everything in ruin, as if the audience would never get tired of that much carnage; overly used slow motion; a couple's silhouette with the sunset as the backdrop... As a slight improvement, there isn't that much schmaltz that sometimes makes the audience cringe. (Armageddon, Pearl Harbor, anyone? Or even the previous Transformers movies.)The story continues with the aftermath of the doomsday that befalls Chicago in the third part. Instead of destroying another great American city, the robot aliens decide to disfigure Hong Kong this time. (Hey, if the Chinese are paying for this, why not?) By the way, Hong Kong actors Ray Lui Leung-wai and Michael Wong, boxer Zou Shiming also made cameos in the film.The Chinese actress Li Bingbing plays a decent supporting role in the movie, with a cold appearance and cool fighting skills. Unlike the character of Fan Bingbing in the X-Men: Days of Future Past, who merely speaks one word ""Time's up"" in a 131-minute movie, Li has plenty of lines. But still, Bingbings' jobs are pretty much the same: winning a bigger chunk of the share in the second largest movie market in the world, other than serving as a porcelain.For the same reason, the Chinese element in the movie has gotten into the extent of extravagant. Every few moments, there is a blatant product placement with a Chinese brand clearly shown to the audience: C'estbon water, Lenovo computers, Construction Bank of China, and Yili milk.It would have been fine if Bay hadn't presented it so awkwardly. Of all places, a Construction Bank of China ATM appears in a Texas town, where the main scenery includes corn fields and ranches; Last minute the role played by Stanley Tucci is running for his life, the next he is seen drinking Yili milk while taking shelter at a rooftop; And the loud declaration by the Chinese defense minister that ""the central government will defend Hong Kong at all costs"" has got to draw some sniggers. Nevertheless, the movie is a box-office hit. According to TIME, as of July 8, the movie had pulled in US$222.74 million in China and officially become the highest grossing film in the country. For the Chinese producers, including those for the movie and the products featured in the show, it is an investment absolutely worth making. Though Michael Bay may not be seen as a good director, he's certainly good at picking out the right tools to make money.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

995,congenius,over-kill personified - save yourself don't watch,3,16 July 2014,The story line seems confusing at first and with the hodge-podge editing/direction you are lost and the movie would just suck. The screenplay confusing - you feel lost suddenly moving from across continents without any explanation. The Father/Daughter relationship they tried to portray was too tacky. Character buildup is not sufficient and you wont like the father or the daughter. Mark wahlburg could have been useful but I cant like an aspiring inventor who is broke and does not take responsibility of his daughter. All his efforts to get his 5 minutes(while putting his daughter in danger) is not a character I want to root for. Instead I would rather see him squashed by optimus prime's toe nail.The graphics were supposed to be good - and they are. But what is the point of graphics if everything else just sucks. This movie is a towering example of CG overkill. You wanna like the fights - you wanna see the bots fighting. But after a while you end up wondering what a waste.Another huge proof of overkill is the length of the movie. With almost 3 hour length the movie kept going on and on and on with no mercy on the audience. I liked the first transformers movie but am hugely disappointed with this movie. Please save your money - this is not something you want to watch.3 stars only for the hard work the graphic designers/artists would have gone through. But without any decent direction/editing/cinematography/characterization/story it just falls flat on its face - an awful awful movie!And don't be fooled by all the good reviews.

1002,nicholassmith-18707,Wow.,10,15 March 2017,"There are no words. I have been at the theater on opening night for every Transformers movie, and this one is no different. There is no activity more engaging than spending three hours of my life staring open-mouthed at aggressively CGI-ed visual stimulus with little substance and no attempt at development to speak of. Although uneducated moviegoers‒‒unlike myself, who can boast a film repertoire including some of my favorite modern masterpieces such as the Avengers series and Independence Day: Resurgence‒‒may view this kind of experience as ""unsatisfying,"" or a ""general waste,"" there is nothing I personally enjoy more than films with pore-established stories and characters that don't require clever storytelling to introduce and reveal through good direction and a well-written screenplay. That way, I don't really have to pay attention to the boring social commentary between the empty action that I'm spending my hard-earned money to see.Transformers: Age of Extinction undoubtedly deserves Best Picture this year‒‒it was exactly what I look for in movies; I can't wait to bring the kids to see it tomorrow‒‒but if that doesn't work out, at least I know I can count on it at least getting Best Makeup.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
1003,sofrostieog,Butt hurt comment on reviews. Sorry not sorry.,10,26 April 2017,"I'm just going to say that this movie was actually really good. If a Transformers ""fan"" out there claims this movie was bad, then obviously they aren't too much of a fan of the series. If you actually think this movie is bad, you should go watch Spongebob again, because action movies aren't for you. I've watched this movie more times than I can count and I must say to see many reviews trash talk it makes me sad. How are you going to say it's ""awful"" or ""the worst of the series""? Then tell others to save their money? Maybe they'll like it. Telling people not to watch it is honestly silly. Some people like different things. Yes it's your opinion, yes it's a review of the movie and your thoughts but really? Give your opinion, but never assume people won't like it.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
1004,nightowlkylehyde,Makes the Transformers movie series deeper and more complex,8,1 June 2017,"This film truly repaired (almost everything) what we hated about the first three actions.Bad: We are introduced to three new Auto-bots (Hound, Drift, and Crosshairs) who really show up with the only backstories being on the back of their toy boxes. The 4 dinosaur robots, without any true names (we fans know their names, but the those are not the fans do not) appear in the film serving as Dues Ex Machina. Some racist stereotypes still exist and Tessa was really not that far off, have you seen some the girls in real life, I'm not sexist, but I know a lot a girls dress with mini shorts (and some men walk around shirtless, or with a half naked girl on their shirts) The blood (energon) of the transformers is on a continuity error, since in 2 and 3 the color had an orange color now to a green color such as when part Prime's head fell off and green stuff splattered out vs. Megatron's blood when he was killed.Good: The movie does not suddenly involve Unicron (I hope they never bring him into the series he was not really a good idea in the original series being that he was killed his first appearance and showed up as a head and in a reference in the Beast Wars and was compared to Predacon Megatron's Ship) or does anything else that would appeal to fans only.Establishes a deeper past into the Transformers relations to humans. Continues to develop the movie Optimus Prime making him aggressive to humans, and the Rachet's and Leadfoot's deaths were actually taken hard by the Autobot crew. All the Cybertronion transformers are given personalities, I say that because excepting Galvatron the prototypes were just goons being controlled by the other baddie. There are three antagonists in this film, all with different goals.Improvements: The racist comments from the first 3 were put on a minimum where the only that movie could offend people is if they took extreme pride in being Irish.Best: Perfectly makes human-transformers relationships more realistic where now there are actually teams of ex. military hunting down the transformers. All main characters are given a goal and a personality,Antagonists: Attinger: not wanting any more innocent deaths that are caused by the battles of the transformers. Lockdown: just an alien bounty hunter with a grudge against the Autobots and Decepticons, since they are always starting wars against each other. Protagonists: Optimus Prime: his aggressiveness is now at a peak, which the comic lovers know where it started(hatch lings)who is really angry at the humans who suddenly turned their backs on the Autobots (I will do a deeper analysis on Prime on my twitter page, KadDaws) Cade: a single poor father trying to do the best for his daughter, and unintentionally gets involved into an alien civil war.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
1005,ferialkarina,awful walhberg,1,18 June 2017,"so it wasn't,t enough to kill the franchise , now we have to watch another Transformer (The last knight) with AGAIN the same awful acting in this case Walberg, it's a shame, the movie was OK, just that and that's for the other actors (except walberg and the boyfriend) the FX, and all the people who worked in this movie...it's a Shame that u have to call Anthony Hopkins call back Duhamel to try to make a good movie of a Flop,he can't do nothing if the lead actor is AWFUL, you had so many good actors, SF great actors, you had to choose the BURGER one6 really?, I am not going to waste my time seeing another atrocity....I am so SAD, I missed, Turtorro, Shia Leboeuf, Megan Fox, I bought the first transformers, I never bought the Walburger ones...I prefer to remember the great ones, than being deceived again.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
1006,mikaelbs,Very very bad,1,12 May 2019,Why did I just watch this? I would rather eat bananas with the Kardashians than watch this,Transformers - Age of Extinction
1007,jaser1230,Why did you have to go there??,7,1 July 2014,"Overall the movie was packed full of action and Mark Wahlberg kicking some butt was much more believable than Shia.The pace of the film was great although 2 hours and 45 minutes is a bit long.I would have given this movie an ""8"" but they had to invent a reason to drop an unnecessary ""f-bomb"". Really Michael Bay?? It had to be done? We as parents take our kids to PG-13 movies because we expect a few lesser curse words and violent action. Captain America, GI Joe, etc. The kids are what keeps your franchise alive because we as parents buy them the toys for birthdays and Christmas.I would have thought twice before taking my below 13 years old kid had I known prior to going in. It was unnecessary and shouldn't have been added.Overall, my kid loved the movie. The Dinobots were awesome and other than Galvetron being a bit cheesy of a name it was a good movie. Action was non-stop. Wahlberg was a good staple for new movies to come. The ending was also a bit cheesy as Optimus said to look at stars and think of his soul. Really? We couldn't have wrapped up a little better? Clean up the language and we'll be back for Transformers #5.",Transformers - Age of Extinction

1009,chris_clour,Optimus CRIME,1,6 February 2020,"I re watched this film today, it was on Netflix and thought why not. Maybe I was in a bad mood when I first watched the film because I remember it was utter garbage when I saw it in the cinema.And yeah it's still utter tripe... unless you are a toddler this film is about as entertaining as a wet kipper on a Wednesday afternoon.The script is terrible. The 'humour' is soul destroying, the effects are good until you see the whole Mazda zoom zoom transforming in mid air nonsense... those effects are dreadful in comparison to every other CGI In the film so I'm not sure why they kept them in (other than not giving a damn).And while I'm on that subject... are we suppose to believe that humans are able to roll out this tech and the transformers never were able to ?!?? Like REALLY?! Anyway I am lacking anymore will to write anymore.. just recalling this drivel has me pooped.Ultimately this franchise has become a cash cow with this film in particular the lowest of the low. The popularity of the series Is fueling its own downfall. It seems to me that anyone Involved in the filmmaking of this poo feels no pressure to make an effort as the film will sell anyway. REBOOT PLEASE",Transformers - Age of Extinction
1010,kirkywood5,Depressing,5,29 June 2014,"I was so disappointed, I wrote my first review ever. Storyline: You can smell Michael Bay all over it. Weak plot points, no attention to details (even in the background), and completely depressing for any fan of movies or the series. Not even believable even in that universe. Cast: It was an upgrade on paper without a doubt but in the context of the movie, I found myself bored as the only spark of entertainment was killed rather too quickly. Sry. The movie was in 3D but the characters were 1D for 2:45 hrs. Kelsey Grammar just prick from beginning to end, Stanley Tucci giving his best Steve Jobs impression, and Marky Mark trying to hold the attention of the audience. Effects: Woof. The technique for the action sequences is a blend of visually appealing, intense, inconsistent, and all-in-all a hideous mess. Explosions resembled plain fireworks, didn't appear to be battles as much as glory shots , and I wasn't sure who was more bullet proof the humans or the transformers. At the end of the day, I'm no filmmaker and it was still nice to see a different spin on things, a different side of Optimus, and a continuation or the series. Room for improvement but I don't expect it in the next installment.",Transformers - Age of Extinction
