0,TheLittleSongbird,Still really effective after all these years,10,14 July 2011,"When I first saw Don't Look Now 4 years ago, I was genuinely unnerved by it, and while it was a film I appreciated more than loved I saw it for the great film it was. Now on re-watch, not only has the impact been left undiminished but I now love this movie. Visually the film is very stylish and haunting, yet there is something very sumptuous and symbolic about it too. The haunting music and sound further add to the atmosphere, as does the screenplay and Nicholas Roeg's superb direction. Don't Look Now also has a great story, it has a touch of poignancy, but it scores best when it is shocking and atmospheric, one scene in particular involving the figure in the red cloak affected me so much I couldn't sleep for days when I first saw it. Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie are note-perfect in their roles. All in all, really effective then and now. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Don't Look Now
1,Leofwine_draca,Breathtakingly beautiful,10,27 February 2013,"Although it has much in common with the Italian gialli that were being made during the same era, DON'T LOOK NOW is a unique film all of its own kind. Despite its art-house sensibilities and slow pacing, I find it a truly stunning piece of work, not least in thanks to Nic Roeg's stunning cinematography which makes a derelict and run-down Venice a bigger character than any in the movie.Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie star as a couple in mourning for the death of their daughter who travel to Venice for the husband's job as a man who restores church artwork. While there, they become obsessed with their daughter's ghost, which may nor may not be haunting the city. Meanwhile, a series of brutal murders are stumping authorities, and the two plot strands are destined to meet in spectacularly brutal fashion.Despite the slow-build nature of the story, it's never less than gripping, thanks to the naturalistic performances of the two stars and the quite wonderful look of each and every scene. I particularly like Roeg's use of colour, in which red becomes an obsession and the director seems to be playing a game with the viewer for the most part.The film is well remembered (and rightly so) for featuring one of the most horrifying endings ever put on film, but I find the movie that comes before it equally enthralling. I saw it once as a teenager and liked it; I rewatched it last night as an adult and revised my opinion. It's not just good, it's fantastic; one of my favourite films of all time.",Don't Look Now
2,Hitchcoc,Not for late night viewing,9,22 March 2006,"I was alone in the house one evening. It was about 11:00 p.m. and it was quiet. I saw this movie was on and decided to give it a try. It starred Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland, so I hoped it would be worth the effort. This turned out to be one of the most gripping films I've every seen. You follow this couple, who are wearing their hearts on their sleeves after the death of their little girl. You watch their pain as they begin to believe that there is some supernatural force at work that is going to reconnect them with their daughter. The red clad figure of a child keeps passing before them, but they never are able to really close in on it. It has to be the little girl. There is one incredible erotic scene which people talk about. This is violent sex. The city of Venice is in its off season and the canals are dirty. Construction is happening around the central figures. It is cold and it is oppressive. Sutherland's character is quite unlikeable. I've always found him to be rather unlikeable. But he must find out. He becomes obsessed with leaving no stone unturned. When we get to the ending, we are on edge, like his manic obsessive presence forces us to be. The ending is, of course, classic. I won't spoil it for anyone. Don't see this movie late at night with the lights down.",Don't Look Now
3,claudio_carvalho,One of the Most Beautiful and Stylish Films I Have Ever Seen,9,17 October 2010,"In England, John (Donald Sutherland) and Laura Baxter (Julie Christie) lose their beloved daughter Christine (Sharon Williams) drowned in a lake in their real state. They move to Venice and leave their son John (Nicholas Salter) in a boarding school. While working in the restoration of a church, John has lunch with Laura that is not fully recovered of her loss and she helps an old lady in the restaurant with a speck of dust in her left eye. Her blind sister that claims to be psychic advises Laura that she can see her daughter happy and close to them; and that John that is also psychic must leave Venice since he is in danger. Laura feels happy with the revelation but the skeptic John does not believe in the elderly sisters. Meanwhile a serial-killer is killing people in Venice. When Laura and John are called during the night by the director of the boarding school telling that John had had a minor accident, Laura travels in the morning to London to see their son. Meanwhile John has an accident in the scaffold in the church and while going back to the hotel, he sees Laura and the sisters on a funeral gondola. Further he glances somebody wearing the red clock with hood that Christine wore when she died. John decides to investigate whether the sisters have abducted his wife and to follow the person with the red cloak with tragic discoveries.""Don't Look Now"" is one of the most beautiful and stylish films I have ever seen. In the 70's, the former cinematographer Nicolas Roeg was in the beginning and the also in the top of his career. This outstanding cult-movie is impressive, with a fragmented narrative and a stunning cinematography even in an old VHS of my own. Julie Christie is extremely beautiful and Donald Sutherland is perfect as usual in the role of a couple traumatized by the loss of their beloved daughter. The screenplay discloses locations that show the decay of Venice, giving sadness to the story. Last time I had seen this film was on 20 January 2000 and today I have just had the pleasure of seeing it again. My vote is nine. Title (Brazil): ""Inverno de Sangue em Veneza"" (""Winter of Blood in Venice"")Note: On 01 November 2013, I saw this movie again on DVD.",Don't Look Now
4,kosmasp,When is it ok then?,8,21 October 2019,"Some things should not be looked into. Or after for that matter. Some other things have so many different things going on, that even looking into them might confuse one more rather than explain things. This movie is one of those cases. It is quite weird to say the least and it has a lot of elements that might not work for a lot of people.Then again this was not made for casual consumption. And as other directors state (on the special features), there are things Roeg does that are considered cinematic mistakes (zooms to name one). But they add to the flair and some even recognize his style over others just for that fact. So what works for some, will not work for others, which is not really a big philosophical discovery. You should get a sense of what the movie tries to do.Either the trailer or maybe even the ""intro"" to the movie should suffice for that. The intro is quite obvious while rather silent. Most viewers should understand what is about to happen. Can you exactly explain why you can? Colors, composition, editing and more things add to that. Expectation surely does too. And yet it still should leave a mark to say the least.While there are places where one might argue the film visibly has aged, there are many that transcend time. The love scene/montage (including nudity) being one of them. Weird to explain or to describe, this coninues to set the tone, but also keep the tone from what we had from the start. A difficult movie to watch for various reasons, but one that you will either cherish or be annoyd by for sure",Don't Look Now
5,gavin6942,The Must-See Film Not Enough People Have Heard Of,8,12 May 2011,"A married couple grieving the recent death of their little daughter are in Venice when they encounter two elderly sisters, one of whom is psychic and brings a warning from beyond.I had only heard of this film recently (within the last year), and even now it seems to be one of the best-kept secrets of the horror genre. Despite consistently getting high praise from people, and having a noteworthy cast, it has little publicity. Unlike ""The Exorcist"" or ""Rosemary's Baby"", it is not often remembered as one of the greats of its time. Perhaps because it is subtle? This may be changing now thanks to it being championed by the Criterion Collection (though those films attract a different sort of audience).Donald Sutherland is a great actor, and rarely gets the respect he deserves. I suppose these days people are more familiar with his son Kiefer. But Donald has a solid record of appearing in great films, this one included. In one scene, we spend a good deal of time gazing upon his nude body. And, strangely enough, this works for me. (I have seen his bottom elsewhere, leading me to think he enjoys this.) Julie Christie is gorgeous, and a perfect supporting actress. She is very calm, serene, and this works.The ever-critical Howard Maxford actually likes this one, calling it ""brilliantly detailed"" and ""thoroughly absorbing"". He goes so far as to call it a ""modern day classic."" These positive words are rare for Maxford, but at least when he uses them he is right. I would love to see a decent copy of this. The first copy I watched was adequate, but had slightly fuzzy sound at times. With it now (2015) being out on Blu-ray, this problem seems to be rectified.Mike Mayo is even more praising, giving the film 4 out of 4. He sees it as ""a harrowing horror that defies classification"". He also points out the ""unusual use of color"" and the ""intensely erotic love scene"", both of which really clinch the film. What lured me in, besides Donald's posterior region, was a shot early on of a photograph with running color. It was beautiful in itself but also symbolic. That such a shot was pulled off really was make or break from my point of view.Director Nicolas Roeg, despite his success here, is not as known to horror fans as he is to those into classic, more critically-loved films. He has a noticeably impressive list, but those unfamiliar with film may not recognize much (beyond ""Doctor Zhivago). Horror fans should know Roeg was the cinematographer on Roger Corman's ""The Masque of the Red Death"", as well as the director of such great films as ""Walkabout"", ""The Man Who Fell to Earth"" and ""Bad Timing"". See these!Asa bonus, fans will be glad to see this is the film debut for composer Pino Donaggio, who has impressed them time and again with ""Carrie"", ""The Howling"" and many others (often working with Brian DePalma).",Don't Look Now
6,lee_eisenberg,"""Nothing is what it seems."" You'd better believe it.",10,17 October 2006,"In my opinion, ""Don't Look Now"" constitutes a real collision of different kinds of careers. Nicolas Roeg had already directed the surreal ""Walkabout"", Donald Sutherland had starred in the humorous ""M*A*S*H"", and Julie Christie had won an Oscar for the bleak ""Darling"". So this one must have really blown people's minds when it came out. Portraying a couple losing a child to a drowning, and thereafter experiencing some rather unexplainable occurrences, the movie might make you question your own sanity. I will say that it's not outright scary, but those scenes on the river...well, just see if you can keep breathing normally after watching those.Anyway, this is definitely one that I recommend. I did not see that ending coming (although I doubt that anyone could predict it). So do look now, and watch the movie...if you dare. Because he's right: nothing is what it seems.",Don't Look Now
7,jboothmillard,Don't Look Now,8,27 January 2006,"I can think of a some reasons for the film title's meaning, but anyway, I am very glad I gave this film from director Nicolas Roeg (Walkabout, The Withches), based on the short novel by Daphne Du Maurier, another chance. In a not all linear story, John (BAFTA nominated Donald Sutherland) and Laura Baxter (BAFTA nominated Julie Christie) are living in Venice to work on an old church, and get over the drowning of their daughter Christine (Sharon Williams). There Laura meets a pair of elderly sisters, Wendy (Clelia Matania) and blind Heather (Hilary Mason) who claims to be psychic and that she can ""see"" the spirit of the dead daughter. Laura of course is intrigued, but John is resiting the idea, but he does take some notice when Laura gives him their warnings to leave Venice. He soon has his own psychic flashes, seeing their daughter running through the streets of Venice in her red coat. The final and shocking scene sees John finding what he thinks is Christine, but is fact a Dwarf (Adelina Poerio) who has been on a murder spree, and John of course is the next victim, getting his throat slashed. Also starring Massimo Serato as Bishop Barbarrigo, Renato Scarpa as Inspector Longhi, David Tree as Anthony Babbage, Ann Rye as Mandy Babbage, Nicholas Salter as Johnny Baxter and Bruno Cattaneo as Detective Sabbione. While the story is filled with creepy and chilling moments, eccentric characters and that terrifying finale, the iconic scene of this film is the passionate sex scene between Sutherland and Christie, portraying husband and wife, with dressing parts edited in it is a remarkable unscripted (improvised by Roeg) scene. Sutherland and Christie make good performances, and while the story isn't all straight forward, it is very watchable, a good idea to watch more than once. It won the BAFTA for Best Cinematography, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Sound Track and Best Film. Julie Christie was number 91 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and she was number 24 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, the film was number 55 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments, it was number 20 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, it was number 40 on The 50 Greatest British Films, and it was number 71 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!",Don't Look Now
8,Tweekums,An atmospheric chiller,9,23 August 2011,"When I sat down to watch this film I knew almost nothing about it which is probably the best way to view it as constantly wondering whether I was watching a psychological thriller, a supernatural thriller or even a horror film kept me on the edge of my seat through out. The film follows John and Laura Baxter who are living in Venice some time after their daughter Christine drowned back in England. They seem to be coping until Laura talks to two women; one of whom claims to be a psychic who can see Christine with her parents. Laura's instinct is to believe the woman but John is convinced they are frauds. Laura sees them again and they warn her that something bad will happen to John if he stays in Venice. When their son has an accident at his boarding school Laura returns to England but soon after she leaves John is convinced he has seen her with the two women but when he can't find her he goes to the police is she really in Venice or is he starting to see things? As he searches for her things get more and more creepy until the film reaches a shocking conclusion.Director Nicholas Roeg maintained an almost constant feeling of unease throughout the film; making Venice seem a claustrophobic and menacing place. Right until the end we don't know what the two women's motives are; are they really trying to help or are they a danger? Stars Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland did fine jobs as the Baxters; their naturalistic performances made them very believable as a married couple totally as ease with each other. If you think that a thriller needs explosions, chases and lots of CGI then this isn't the film for you; however if you want something genuinely chilling I'm sure you'll like this.",Don't Look Now

10,BA_Harrison,Charley says 'Never play near water'.,7,12 August 2018,"Having clearly not seen the 'Charley Says' public information films, a little girl, Christine, drowns in a pond while trying to retrieve her ball. Still struggling to come to terms with their grief, her parents, John Baxter (Donald Sutherland) and Laura (Julie Christie), travel to Venice where John has been commissioned to restore an old church. While in Venice, Laura encounters two old women, one of whom is a blind psychic who tells her that she can see Christine and that her dead daughter is happy. Meanwhile, John catches fleeting glimpses of a small figure in a red plastic mac, similar to the one worn by Christine when she died. Could the couple's bizarre experiences have anything to do with a series of unsolved murders in the city?I'm a big fan of gialli, and had heard that Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now, based on a novel by Daphne Du Maurier, shared much in common with the genre: a puzzling plot, an atmospheric Italian locale, stunning cinematography, experimental editing, and a marvellous score by Pino Donaggio. Even though Roeg's film is a little more arthouse in style than your average giallo, and focusses more on the emotional impact of death than on death itself, there is more than enough here to interest those who enjoy Italian murder/mysteries. It might get a little pretentious at times, with its repetitive symbolism and non-linear narrative, and some might find the pace a little slow, but it's hard to deny the skill and passion that has gone into the making of this film, from both cast and crew.",Don't Look Now
11,moonspinner55,"Death, grief, sex, confusion, murder...",6,7 December 2005,"Nicolas Roeg drama, patchily intense without being really absorbing, has married couple Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie grieving the death of their daughter; when a strange psychic tells them the deceased child is trying to contact them from beyond, Sutherland becomes obsessed with finding the truth. After a fascinating opening, this psychological thriller gets more and more murky, leading to a wet climax in Venice, Italy that leaves the viewer feeling high and dry. Roeg enjoys frenzied story loops, curious cuts and editing techniques, but he doesn't have a trace of humor--good, dark or otherwise--and the heaviness of the film is more memorable than the story (which is anti-climactic) or the performances. **1/2 from ****",Don't Look Now
12,Quinoa1984,"leaves you with an uneasy feeling watching it, and I mean that, strangely, as a compliment",8,20 December 2007,"Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Back takes the premise of parents coming to grips with the tragic and untimely death of their daughter like a paranoid thriller, but not in the sense that it always will keep you on the edge of your seat. On the contrary, there are stretches in the film where you wonder where it will be going (early in the film more-so than other parts, though this is part of Roeg's design as it unfolds). As their other child, a son away at boarding school, gets sick and Julee Christie's character- who has been given a chilling premonition by a blind Italian lady while the two of them, the other played by Donald Sutherland, are in Venice- goes to see to him, the results start to affect Sutherland's character. He sees someone in a red coat, in quick glimpses, and even thinks he sees Christie again. But is there a plot growing in the works? Is he seeing what he thinks he is, or does he lose his rationality? Like Roeg's previous film, Walkabout, there are times when the story is taking such a leisurely pace that it has to be on part of the audience to stay with it. But Roeg twists the screws just slightly, making little things and the attention to details via quick edits, super-impositions, that darn abstraction of the red-mark (which, by the way, shows up later in a church Sutherland is remodeling), that one doesn't want to look away. It is, on the one hand, sort of cheating for what its core audience might want- it doesn't get very much suspenseful until the last ten minutes or so, when finally the stakes are raised just enough through circumstance, and Sutherland succumbing to what he early on had warned Christie off of (believing the blind lady out of some idea that the daughter was still alive).On the other hand, it's not exactly about the suspense anyway: it's taken from a short story by the same author who provided stories for some of Hitchcock's films (Rebecca and The Birds), and while it could be said that the filmmaker doesn't shy away from a twist at the end or with some direct musical choices throughout (albeit Roeg doesn't quite get a Herrmann here), it's less about that than about the mind losing a stake in what may or may not really be happening. Is it paranoid if it's really happening to you? Roeg seems to suggest paranoia following the character (is there a plot surrounding Sutherland and Christie, the blind lady, the detective, the strange murders occurring), but his style isn't that of a Hitchcock. He'll linger on some scenes, make some flashes to others, and it sort of put me in a strange mood watching it, almost like watching Antonioni (and even then a comparison is hard to do as the style of both with the camera is separate).What Don't Look Back does is surprise the viewer, if not completely successfully in terms of genre than as something reaching outside the bounds of it, and that's what makes it work as well as it does (if at all) so many years later. The editing is especially good, as was with Walkabout (watch the cross-cutting between the steamy, ""real"" husband-wife kind of sex scene and the two of them getting dressed the next day), the mood has a eerie effect without over-stepping itself, and there's also one of the most disturbing killers from a 1970s film. And it goes without saying that Sutherland and Christie both turn in fantastic work here (the former probably more than the latter, if only because of his amount of screen time outranking the other).",Don't Look Now
13,BandSAboutMovies,Near perfect,8,20 October 2020,"Don't Look Now is the kind of movie that people should talk about in the same hushed tone that they reserve for The Exorcist and The Bird With the Crystal Plumage and they don't. That makes no sense to me, so perhaps these words will do something to change that.Compared to Performance, director Nicolas Roeg's directorial debut (he co-directed with Donald Cammell), this is a simple film. Compare it to anything else and it's as complex as it gets. Roeg had already contributed to the horror genre with his director of photography work on The Masque of the Red Death, but this rumination on loss stands apart, using the genre itself to try and make sense out of the senseless.In the same way that the giallo plays with themes of misinterpretation and mistaken identity often when it comes to sexual identity, this movie does the same when it comes to trying to get through the grief of losing a child and perhaps a marriage.It's also a deconstruction of how we perceive time through the lens of film. Instead of just flashbacks, this movie is filled with a fluid sense of time, in that we experience the past, present and the future almost simultaneously, as if we were Jon Osterman becoming the ubermensch Dr. Manhattan.Real-life couple Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner (ironic, as this movie concerns a drowning death) were suggested for the leads of Laura and John Baxter, but Roeg only saw Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland in his film. Sutherland was worried that the film gave a bad name to ESP, but Roeg told him this was the story they were telling.John and Laura have come to Venice after the death of their daughter Christine in a drowning accident. While working to restore an ancient church, he meets two sisters. One of them, Heather (Hilary Mason, I Don't Want to Be Born), is a psychic and she reveals that a great danger is coming for John. This danger - in all ways that we see time in the film - hangs as heavy as the death of his daughter, who the psychic reveals that she can see around the couple.That night, before dinner, John and Laura finally make love after a long period of coolness, as she is relieved that her daughter seems to be at peace. This moment - the love scene is intercut with them getting ready for dinner afterward - plays with our notions of time, making this entire scene feel like a dream. It could also very well be an actual sex scene, as it was rumored for years that the acting couple was really having sex, to the consternation of Christie's boyfriend Warren Beatty, who was usually the one doing the cucking.At dinner, the couple is briefly separated and John sees what he believes to be his daughter. This image of her in the red coat she died in dominates the movie, luring him into more foreign places and deeper dangers. As their son is injured at boarding school, Laura must return home. Despite this, John sees her as part of a canal funeral procession. And oh yes - there's also a serial killer on the loose.I know that I often discuss the spoilers of films that are half a century old here, but in the hopes that you haven't seen this film, I want you to enjoy the mystery that it presents for yourself. Roeg emerges as a consummate filmmaker here and this English giallo shot in Venice deserves so many more words than it has received.",Don't Look Now
14,Coventry,SUPERnatural!,7,28 March 2004,"First establishment: don't even consider watching this film when you're tired and/or trying to conquer sleepbecause you'll lose. The terror in Don't Look Now is strictly psychological and whether it's a masterpiece or not all depends on the viewer's state of mind. It could become one of the most superbly chilling films you'll ever see, but at the same time you could say it's very overrated and not that compelling at all.
Second establishment: the settings, scenery and locations couldn't possibly be better. Don't Look Now is almost entirely set in Venice, Italy which is the most appropriate décor to tell a paranormal tale. The story completely depends on the dark alleys, ancients cathedrals and typical waters where it's shot at. Donald Sutherland and his wife Julie Christie settled in Venice to slowly forget the death of their young daughter. While Sutherland is restoring a cathedral, his wife is approached by a blind, psychic lady who claims to be in contact with the couple deceased daughter. This spiritual woman comes with a warningbut she can only foresee a tragedynot forestall it! Nicolas Roeg is a brilliant cinematographer and he can create a hardly bearable tension without showing shocking images. The drama and sentiment in Don't Look Now is well-represented, of course, since it handles about the worst thing parents can go throughWitnessing and living with the dead of their own child. The supernatural methods that Roeg implements are unique and it's almost impossible to discover them all in one single viewing. Perfect example of that is Sutherlands walk in the dark alley, where all the ominous elements of the little girl's dead are repeatedThat's pretty brilliant but you don't realize it right away. Some of the storytelling require a wide attention-span and I'll fairly admit that the film is overall long and pretty boring at times. Even the explicit (and infamous) sex sequence is way too long. Donald Sutherland is a class A actor, even though his haircut never looked so ridiculous. Julie Christie is a loveable wife and very convincing as the heart-broken mother.",Don't Look Now
15,hitchcockthelegend,Hauntingly brilliant.,9,10 October 2008,"After the tragic death of their daughter, John and Laura Baxter take a trip to Venice in the hope of being able to move on from the tragedy. Once there they meet a strange couple of elderly sisters, one whom is blind claims to have psychic ability and that she can see their deceased daughter amongst them. In the days that follow, John starts glimpsing a small figure in a red raincoat, similar to the one their daughter was wearing at the time of the accident, as a serial killer runs amok, the Baxters are heading toward the day of revelation.Don't Look Now is based on a short story written by Daphne du Maurier, director Nicolas Roeg adapting it to create an eerie picture that fuses mysterious supernatural strands with meditations on fallible human emotions. From the opening quarter where we witness the death of the Baxters daughter {stunningly filmed by Anthony Richmond} Don't Look Now continues to amaze both technically {the Venice locale is poetically creepy} and more crucially with its ""nothing is what it seems"" aura. So many scenes linger long in the mind, be it striking images in the aftermath of a serial killers victim or the shuddering haunting climax as the plots intricacies come crashing together, all played out to Pino Donaaggio's poignantly perfect score.Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie play our bereaved parents quite magnificently, the chemistry is positively electric. The way they portray the parents in this mournful state as they try to move on is highly impressive and firmly has the audience feeling their struggle. Much has been made of their love making scene in the picture, such is it's intensity and the brilliant way it's filmed, it has begged the question on if they really did make love on this occasion!, what isn't in doubt is that there is no titillation to be had here, it's one of the most beautiful filmed sex scenes to have ever been made, Roeg inter cutting it with the couple preparing to go out after the act of love making has finished.Don't Look Now is slowly paced, but that is its chief triumph, it begs you to pay attention and take in everything that is going on, from the slightest little detail to the jolting shock moments, all is relevant to make this a film that firmly rewards those patient enough to be lost in this creepy and enigmatic classic. 9/10",Don't Look Now
16,Hey_Sweden,"A solid chiller, well acted by Christie and Sutherland.",8,26 April 2015,"""Don't Look Now"" is a good and engrossing film, a moody story that is well told. An adaptation of the story by Daphne Du Maurier, it stars the lovely Julie Christie and the always excellent Donald Sutherland. They play Laura and John Baxter, a couple who lose one of their two children in a drowning accident. Some time after that, they're living and working in Venice, Italy while their surviving child attends school in England. Laura chances to meet two middle aged sisters, Heather and Wendy (Hilary Mason and Clelia Matania). Heather, who is blind, seems to have a ""second sight"" that compels her to tell Laura that her deceased daughter is happy. However, there's a warning from the beyond that somebody is in danger. And, as it happens, there's a killer on the loose in Venice.This is certainly very well done on a technical and artistic level. The characters of Laura and John are compelling, and Christie and Sutherland work nicely together. He's highly skeptical of this supposed psychic ability of Heathers', but ultimately humours Laura, whose mood brightens considerably after having made the acquaintance of these two sisters. Venice is a beautiful location for this tale, and director Nicolas Roeg, working with cinematographer Anthony B. Richmond, gives this film superb atmosphere. Right from those opening credits, a mood is created, and the filmmakers guide us on an interesting journey that gets more surreal towards the end. The action is highlighted by an especially steamy sex scene (and both Christie and Sutherland get nude), and is ended with a riveting finale.The colour red is turned into a thematic element, right from beginning to end, and viewers aren't that likely to forget the sight of the red raincoat.Strongly recommended.Eight out of 10.",Don't Look Now

18,poolandrews,The masterpiece as is so often claimed?,6,25 December 2009,"Don't Look Now starts in England where architect John Baxter (Donald Sutherland) is moments too late to save his young daughter Christine (Sharon Williams) from drowning in a pond on his country estate, both he & his wife Laura (Julkie Christie) are devastated & decide to move to Venice in Italy to get away from England & the memories where John has been hired to restore a Church. While eating out in a restaurant Laura meets two elderly sisters named Wendy (Clelia Matania) & Heather (Hilary Mason) who claims to be psychic & is able to talk with & see Laura's dead daughter Christine, Laura begins to believe the sisters & feels better knowing that Christine is able to communicate with her but when John finds out he is sceptical & wants nothing to do with the sisters...This English Italian co-production was directed by Nicolas Roeg & the script was based on the short ghost story Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier & the script takes that basic idea & stretches it out over 110 minutes with variable results. Don't Look Now is often held up as some artistic masterpiece packed with depth, meaning & symbolism as well as a twist ending that in my opinion is alright but hardly the genuine surprise shocker than many might have you believe while other's describe Don't Look Now as a boring mess that people read far too much into & interpret even the littlest thing as having some great meaning. To me the truth lies somewhere between the opinions as I appreciate Don't Look Now as a decent & often absorbing ghost story it didn't knock my socks off & it did bore me a bit which is the ultimate sin a film can commit as far as I am concerned. The majority of the film fells like a calm drama where everything is normal & two grieving people are just trying to get on with their lives, there's the sub-plot about the psychic sister but largely it's pretty unremarkable stuff until the hour mark where the supernatural elements kick in more & all the set-ups that Roeg has staged & planted start to come to fruition but it's still sedately paced by anyone's standards & then there's that twist ending which is sort of gruesome in a dark way which then does try to tie everything together in a series of flashbacks that sort of work but isn't entirely satisfying. Don't Look Now goes from tedium to mystery to gripping drama to horror & almost everything between without ever really grabbing me, sure I liked it & it tells a decent ghost story with a decent twist ending but I wanted to describe it as brilliant & not just decent.Roeg really lets fly with the imagery here as it's absolutely everywhere, from the broken glass of the mirror at the start to the broken glass of the glasses on the table Laura knocks over to the broken glass at the end to the symbolism of the water Christine drowned in as they move to Venice which is obviously a city built around water, the water in glasses Laura breaks, the rain whenever we go back to England & the like & then there's the shiny red plastic mac which also becomes a major part of the films imagery. Don't Look now is the sort of film some could sit down & analyze for like hours, every scene or every moment could have an alternate meaning or some sort of hidden depth, personally I think life is too short for that & while there is obvious symbolism here it gets dull fairly quickly. There's no real gore in it although the twist ending does feature a little blood & there's a pretty steamy sex scene here too. Don't Look now is undeniably well shot with nice cinematography & the tight, narrow streets & canals of Venice almost become a character in their own right.With a supposed budget of about $1,500,000 this has good production values & is well made, shot on location in both England & Italy. The acting is alright, Sutherland is OK but not brilliant while Julie Christie at least looks great.Don't Look Now is a film that is a personal experience, how much you get out of it will depend entirely on how you take to Roeg's symbolism & the often sedately paced nature of the story which just has either Suntherland or Christie run around Venice for extended periods not doing that much. I liked it, I could see where it was coming from & it's fairly absorbing but I wouldn't call it the masterpiece many seem to. The IMDb lists a Don't Look Now (2011) remake as in production & I'll be amazed if it's anything like the original if it ever gets made.",Don't Look Now

It isn't a movie that scares you with some scene's, it is a movie that gets into you and just won't let go and builds up a nightmare like tension. The atmosphere is fantastic and gives the movie a haunting feeling. Venice really works as the perfect backdrop for this movie. The best movie set in Venice ever? Even though there aren't any scary sequences in the movie, the ending is really horrifying, it really freaked me out the first time I saw it, I think 5 years ago. On my second viewing, not too long ago I was prepared for the ending but it still was a very scary thing to watch!The storytelling might seem slow but it works perfect for the movie and its tension. There are some brilliant moments in the movie that all come together once the ending approaches. The editing and cinematography are perfect, as are the performances by the cast.And what is a decent comment without mentioning the famous love scene? Ah yes, the love scene, it really is one of the best love scene's ever. It is brilliantly filmed and even more brilliantly edited.

20,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Well, at least they were honest and kind enough to put a warning in the title",5,10 April 2008,"I cannot claim that I ever got into this one. After starting with a scene the ending of which is so obvious that one wonders why they bothered putting it in, this continues at a pace that can best be described as drab, and with a basic idea so ""been there, done that"" that there are clichés going ""oh, come on"". Something as basic as the *volume levels* are messed up in this(forgive me for being of the persuasion that one should not have to have the remote in hand, fingers fixed over the controls), and if you can't scare your audience without deafening them(I will mention no names...Paul...yes, you, with the initials after), you might want to consider improving your skills in that field. At one time my eyes were away from the screen(well, not only one), and what I heard reminded me most of the animated segments(!) on Monty Python's Flying Circus. Finishing off the audio side, the music never seemed to actually follow(or even all that properly contrast to) the action, and every single bit in the film that had people be on the phone with each other had the involved parties speaking completely separate(and not necessarily parallel, for that matter) conversations, at least at one point or more before hanging up. The cinematography and editing vary, but they go further in the direction of the negative(and take a break on the slow-mo, John Woo-wanna-be... it is *not* working for you). The acting didn't impress me. The mystery ended unsatisfactorily(it sure did to me), if taken in sans analysis(and I'm not putting that much effort into it for this one, no dice). There's a sex scene, reportedly rather graphic(I wouldn't know, I didn't grant it a single look, not into pornography, same reason(coupled with an utter lack of interest in the subject and person) I'm not watching Caligula), which is entirely gratuitous(the Trivia claims that without it, all the main couple would do when seen together is argue... come again? They hardly do so at all). I found this much more valuable as something MST3K than anything else. But hey, I'm not into Italian horror, I don't care for Argento either, so you don't have to take my word for it. If I haven't deterred you from viewing this by now, go right ahead.

21,evanston_dad,Like Having Glass Ground Into Your Eyeballs,1,13 March 2006,"Heed the warning of this movie's title and don't look at it now...or ever.This atrocious psychological thriller is neither psychologically complex nor especially thrilling. Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland play parents mourning the accidental death of their daughter, wandering around Venice while Sutherland is engaged in the renovation of an old cathedral. They run into a blind psychic and her sister, and their encounters with them bring Christie some solace about her daughter, but send Sutherland into a paranoid spiral which culminates in him following who he thinks is his dead daughter into the bell tower of a church and then.....well, much hype has been built around the ""shocking"" ending to this movie, but let's just see if you give a damn about what happens by the time you get to it.My description of the plot makes it sound like it makes much more sense than it does when you're actually watching the film, because I've left out all of the utterly gratuitous and boring scenes that bring nothing to the party. Director Nicholas Roeg never met a trendy 1970s film trick that he didn't like, and so this movie is full of zooms, both in and out, jarring camera work and harsh, ear-splitting sound effects. I guess he's trying for a nerve-jangling effect, but it all seems like a lot of fuss and bother over nothing. This is an assemblage of disconnected scenes badly in need of a story.The most frightening thing about ""Don't Look Now"" is the extended love-making scene that assaults us with a fully nude Donald Sutherland. Now that's what will make you turn your eyes away in horror.Grade: F",Don't Look Now

As a result, there are long periods of running time in which nothing much happens, as the film goes around in circles without advancing the story. But the climax, the last 5 minutes or so, are chilling and unforgettable - perhaps one of the best cinematic finales of the 1970s as a whole (along with another Donald Sutherland picture, ""The Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"").

He, however, seems to have his own psychic flashes, seeing their daughter walk the streets in her red cloak, as well as Laura and the sisters on a funeral gondola.....With its brooding atmosphere, right from the upstart, the film is one of the most unsettling experiences I have ever had the fortune to see.Venice is usually such a beautiful place, but here, Roeg has made one of the most romantic places In the world, depressing and menacing, which indicates that no one is going to be happy come the end.As The Exorcist, gave us Captain Howdy, and Jaws gave us peril with the Colour Yellow, this has a little mash up with both. Whenever Red appears on screen, something bad happens, or is about to, and just who is the mysterious figure in the red coat.Sutherland and Christie play amazing roles, and literally have beautiful chemistry. As the film progresses with glimpses of hope ( the blind sister stating the daughter is happy), the hope turns into despair, with scenes that are terrifying yet subliminally beautiful.The scene in the church when the scaffolding falls is beautifully shot, with silence deafening the ear, and the last fifteen minutes, is beautiful, but the most dread filled fifteen minutes of mainstream cinema you may ever see.Horridly beautiful and mesmerising.",Don't Look Now
25,Aaron1375,"Great atmosphere, but it is a very slow burning thriller/horror film",6,14 February 2017,"I will first say, this film is not entirely my cup of tea. I thought the atmosphere was great and I kept wondering how it would end; however, at the same time the descriptions of the movie that I read overstated the supernatural aspects of the film so it was not what I was expecting. I was expecting more of a horror film than it was, it is more of a thriller and drama with horror aspects to it. The setting was great and the whole couple out of place in a very different world was very interesting, but once again, it needed more creepy elements for my tastes. I sort of liked areas of it, but at the same time, there were times where the film just seemed kind of all over the place too. So, I recognize it as a good movie, but it really was not my kind of horror film. It just seemed like it would be more of a movie that I would enjoy because as I said, everything I had read stressed that the film as a whole would have more supernatural elements than it ended up having. The only thing that was vaguely supernatural was the fact there was a blind woman in it that had physic ability. Though I have read several theories and there were suggestions that were interesting, but from what I have heard the short story kind of dispels it which is sad because it suggests a demon which makes it more intriguing.The story is about a couple who have recently lost a child and are trying to cope with it in Venice where the husband is trying to restore an old church. During their stay they come across sisters. One of them is blind and claims to have seen the couple's daughter and says that the young girl is happy and this makes the mother pass out at first, but afterwards she becomes less distant and happier. Unfortunately, the husband does not get any benefits and strange he begins to see strange things, but dismisses the warnings that he should leave Venice because his life is in danger. Things begin to get darker as he tries to understand the strange things he is seeing.The story reminds me of a couple of other films, neither of them well known. One of them featured a woman on an island who has blacked out and she begins to feel that she is being watched by some strange organization, it was called, Footprints on the Moon. The other film that this reminds me of is a film called, The Appointment about a girl with strange powers and a mother that sees visions about the father. The Appointment had the most supernatural elements, but I have not seen that one in forever. This one needed more and the other one was really weird and like this one, open to interpretation.So, this film had some things about it I enjoyed. The atmosphere and the setting were great. I just prefer there being more weird stuff going on and quite frankly, I like Donald Sutherland as an actor, but I have never wanted to see his buttocks. Not sure why the female actress got top billing over him as he is definitely the main character in this one and he does rather well, but there are some odd moments for both him and the actress that just seemed strange for a grieving couple. In the end, this film is a very slow burn film, that type of film being prevalent during the late 60's and early 70's. What does that mean? Well, just that the horror in the film takes almost the entire film to build up before finally getting a payoff. Rosemary's Baby would be another example of a film of this type. The creepiest scenes in this one are the scene at the beginning where he spills the water on the picture and the ending scene where we get the big payoff.",Don't Look Now

27,The_Void,"Mysterious, brooding and bone chilling at the climax!",9,19 September 2005,"Don't Look Now is a strange horror film in that it doesn't rely on the usual horror genre staples in order to be successful. Rather than be gratuitous on the gore, atmosphere and shocks front, Don't Look Now simply presents it's story and the horror almost seems like an afterthought. Usually, films like this annoy me because they obviously want to portray the horror, but skirt around it in order to not be put in with the less intelligent offerings from the genre; but this one clearly cares about it's story and characters, and never really sets out to scare. The film, therefore, comes off as being assured and well handled throughout, and even though the plot is slow; the film can never be described as boring because there's always enough bubbling under the surface of the immediate goings on in order to keep the viewers' interest. The plot is shrouded with mystery and follows a father who finds his daughter drowned in a nearby lake. He and his wife then move to picturesque Venice, but the memory of their daughter cannot be laid to rest after a blind psychic tells the woman that she has seen her daughter may still be alive.I love the horror genre, but I admit that a large proportion of it can't be compared among the true classics of cinema due largely to a lack of production values, good acting or a decent script that is coherent with the story and characters. Don't Look Now, however, often appears on film lists amongst the classics because this is one of the films that is strong in those areas. The acting is first rate, with Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie giving brilliant brooding performances that are in line with their characters and the film's plot. Sutherland can be something of a one-note actor, but when a performer is given the right material it allows them to shine and his role in this film fits him like a glove. One of the main compliments that this film gets is the cinematography, as the film expertly captures the beauty of it's central location. Venice's canals and dark alleys are as much a part of this film as the plot itself, and it is testament to Nicolas Roeg's directorial talent that this has been expertly captured in a way that helps the film. On the whole, this is a fine horror film that will be enjoyed by anyone that is willing to put time and effort into it. It's also worth noting that this film pays it's viewers at the climax with one of the best twist endings in the horror genre. Highly recommended!",Don't Look Now

29,christopher-underwood,This has long been a favourite,10,24 August 2014,"This has long been a favourite and, for me, is one of those rare things, a perfect film. It doesn't matter when I watch it but it always catches me from the start and has me hooked for the duration. Indeed, I always seem to pick up on some reference or repeat motif that I had previously missed and in this way the film even gets better. It helps that I have always liked the director and both stars, oh I've just thought of something I don't like and seems to irritate me more each time - Julie Christie's wig, but no matter. The pair seem to have a particular understanding for each other in this and maintain our interest and deep involvement throughout. There is often discussion about whether the couple really had sex during that scene but the point is not whether they did or not but that it certainly looks as if they did, which is all a director can do. Direction, colour control, editing, acting, music all so very splendid but damn, I've just thought of one more shortcoming. Well, it isn't really, I'm sure it was intentional, but this does not show Venice in its best light. One of the reasons I never went to stay in the city for many years was partly how less than splendid it looks here. Death in Venice was another reason but that's another story. I accept that the mould, decay and neglect so evident helps to maintain the creepiness.",Don't Look Now
30,JamesHitchcock,One of the Greatest British Films of the Seventies,10,22 September 2009,"Like ""Walkabout"", Nicolas Roeg's first film as sole director, his second, ""Don't Look Now"", begins with a sudden, tragic death. Whereas ""Walkabout"" is about two children trying to come to terms with the sudden death of a parent, ""Don't Look Now"" is about two parents trying to come to terms with the sudden death of a child. It tells the story of a couple, architect John Baxter and his wife Laura, whose young daughter Christine drowns when she accidentally falls into a pond in their garden.The scene then moves to Venice, where John is in charge of the restoration of an ancient church. Laura accompanies him, hoping that by spending time together they will be able to come to terms with their grief, which has been putting their marriage under strain. While in Venice, they are befriended by two elderly sisters, Heather and Wendy. Heather, who is blind, appears to have psychic powers and claims to be in contact with Christine's spirit. Laura believes in Heather's powers, and derives comfort from what the sisters tell her, but John remains sceptical. John's attitude begins to change, however, when Heather warns him that he will be in danger if he remains in Venice and shortly afterwards he narrowly escapes death in an accident at work. He begins to catch glimpses of a child-like figure in a red raincoat who resembles his dead daughter (Christine was wearing such a raincoat at the time of her death) and tries to pursue this mysterious figure, who always eludes him.The film was highly controversial when it appeared in 1973 because of the now- famous love scene between Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland, unusually graphic by the standards of the time, although it seems to have got past the censors without too much trouble. In the seventies it seemed to be the case that sex scenes were more acceptable, not only to the censors but also to many critics and elements of the public, if they could be shown to be ""necessary to the plot"". Although this idea must have led to many scriptwriters tinkering with their plots in a desperate attempt to work in a ""necessary"" sex scene, I think that ""Don't Look Now"" is one case where such a scene is entirely justified. The sex scene represents an important stage in John and Laura's relationship, the first time they have made love since losing their daughter, so its importance to the plot is crucial. It was, apparently, not in the original script and was added at the last minute by Roeg who wanted to show that, despite the strains on their marriage, the relationship between John and Laura is one based upon love and desire.Roeg has always struck me as a director who never really lived up to the promise of his early work. His third and fourth films, ""The Man who Fell to Earth"" and ""Bad Timing"", were a disappointment, being confusing and self-consciously arty. In the seventies he was clearly aiming at becoming an ""auteur"" director, but some of his more recent films have been more obviously commercial. ""Don't Look Now"", however, is in my view his masterpiece, although I also have a high regard for ""Walkabout"".Roeg began his career as a cinematographer, and ""Don't Look Now"", like a number of his films, is a highly visual one. Because most tourists visit Venice in summer, non-Italians normally associate the city with sunshine, blue skies and dazzling white buildings. The film, however, is set in winter, and the Venice we see here, although still beautiful, is a city of mists and pale, cloudy skies. (The few scenes set in England have a similar look).The background palette is dominated by muted colours- greys, browns, pale greens and blues- but in the foreground one bright colour stands out- red. Many scenes contain a single vivid red object- a scarf, a hat, a telephone, a bunch of flowers, a stained-glass window and, most importantly, the red coats worn by Christine and the mysterious figure. This colour scheme provides a visual unity to the work, as does another recurring motif, light on water. In Daphne du Maurier's original short story, on which the film is based, Christine dies of an illness; this was presumably changed for the film so as to draw a subtle visual parallel between the pond in which she drowns, also on a grey winter's day, and the canals of Venice. Another Roeg trademark is the unorthodox editing, especially in the love scene where shots of John and Laura making love are intercut with footage of them getting dressed for dinner afterwards.The film's visual style is only one of the reasons why it is a favourite of mine. It is the sort of film which works on a number of different levels and in which I find more every time I see it. It is sometimes referred to as a ""horror"" film, but it is actually far more than that, among other things a psychological study of the effects of grief and bereavement. Both Sutherland and Christie are excellent, and the performances they give must rank among their best as they show us two grieving parents who try to overcome their grief in different ways. On another level, as already discussed, it has a subtle visual beauty. On a third level it is a haunting, uncanny and unsettling mystery story. There is no straightforward, logical explanation for everything that happens to the Baxters, but no such explanation is needed as this is a film where ambiguity and mystery are more effective than a direct, rational approach, with all loose ends neatly tidied up, could be. In this it recalls that other great seventies drama, Peter Weir's ""Picnic At Hanging Rock"". ""Don't Look Now"" is one of the best British films of the decade. 10/10",Don't Look Now
31,lasttimeisaw,"On screen, Venice has never looked so gloomy and despondent",8,17 June 2016,"On screen, Venice has never looked so gloomy and despondent, not even in Visconti's wintry and self-absorbed DEATH IN VENICE (1971), cinematographer-turned-auteur Nicolas Roeg's DON'T LOOK NOW, renders Venice a sinister aura with dilapidation and chill in the air.In the preamble, we witness with trepidation of two tots playing outside an estate, around a muddy pond, whereas their laisser-faire parents are fiddling with their own business inside, the crosscutting sequences reaches an uncanny culmination when the father, John Baxter (Sutherland), has a premonition with crimson colour appearing on his slide, rushes out and plunges into the pond, only too late to rescue their daughter Christine from drowning.In the next scene, John and his wife Laura (Christie) are in Venice, he accepts a job to restore a run-down cathedral commissioned by Bishop Barbarrigo (Serato). They are still under the grief of losing Christine, but on the surface, they try not bickering about it or shifting blames, and seem to well possess their composure in the off-season Floating City. Their mental recuperation process is interrupted by the encounter of two fellow British tourists, Wendy (Matania) and her blind sister Heather (Mason), the latter is a psychic, gifted with a second sight, although being a complete stranger to the couple, she tells Laura that she can see Christine with them in the restaurant. This revelation shocks Laura to her core, but after an initial collapse, she regains her strength and spirit, because Heather has told her that Christine is happy now, so she can finally let go of the pestering guilt, and back in the hotel, the film's (in)famously graphic sex scenes between her and John inter-cut with shots of their post-coitus dressing-up, which leaves an impression of their rekindled passion, a foreign land does work as an antidote for one's tragic experience.However, men have a different approach respecting sorrow and regret, a non-superstitious John is grudgingly against the idea of Laura meeting the two sisters, they quarrel but Laura insists, Heather informs her that John is the one who also has the power to connect with Christine, who is trying to communicate with him but he is too hard-bitten to see that, meanwhile an unknown serial- killer is at large in the city, and John has the vision of seeing fleeting images of Christine materialising in the streets. Things will become more eerie when John nearly survives a fall during his work and claims to see Laura on a passing gondola clothed all black for a funeral ceremony with the two British ladies present, when in reality, she is back in Britain to visit their son in the boarding school. Who's funeral is this? Soon he will find out in the lurid twist where he unyieldingly follows a figure resembles a little girl to a deserted palace, beset with mist, danger and gore.Roeg devilishly exploits the tropes of death, living and the medium in-between, completed with an effectual nod to the religious mystery and metaphysics, and keeps them in the mix by leaving titillating clues to suggest a Gothic apparition or an evil hidden agenda is brewing, with a little help from Pino Donaggio's unnerving score and cogently retains the frisson of Daphne Du Maurier's original short story up until the shocking disclosure in the end. Sutherland and Christie support each other in wandering in the occult atmosphere with earthly bearings as two sane souls steeled with their own beliefs, and Hilary Mason engraves a legendary mien of an unstable medium dwelling eternally in a cryptic universe. More significantly, DON'T LOOK NOW is a textbook marvel of how to cook up a top-shelf psychological thriller, constituted with sterling craftsmanship, and resists the common pitfall of descending into a spur- of-the-moment camp scare-fest.",Don't Look Now
32,Red-Barracuda,A visually complex puzzle of a film,9,25 October 2011,"Nicolas Roeg was certainly a master of the montage. During his prime he directed a series of films in which striking visuals were edited together such that they impacted the viewer in unusual ways. It is this bold use of editing that truly marks Roeg out as a visual stylist. With Don't Look Now these skills are evident from the outset. In fact, this movie above all others in the director's catalogue is perhaps the best example of his skilled use of this form for maximum emotional impact. The story about a couple who lose their daughter in a drowning accident and then move to Venice to forget, is replete with recurring imagery that only becomes fully meaningful on repeat viewings. Motifs such as water, mirrors and the colour red are repeatedly featured throughout the film. Water - the Baxter's little girl drowns, they leave England in the middle of a downpour only to move to Venice the city on the sea; mirrors - are seemingly everywhere, reflecting characters emotions, are broken immediately prior to the drowning; red - feels so prominent because it is used so sparingly - the colour red is almost completely removed from the colour scheme of the film other than key flashes of it at certain moments - this stylistic detail is not obvious but if you look back at the film you will see.One of the most unusual features of Don't Look Now is the way it presents Venice. This magnificent city is not depicted in a typical travelogue fashion. Famous landmarks are almost non-existent. Back alleys and crumbling buildings are instead featured throughout. This off-season Venice is sparsely populated. It looks cold and ominous. Which of course fits in perfectly with the theme of the movie. The labyrinthine corridors of the city mirror the complex psychological inner workings of the protagonists minds. The atmosphere throughout is eerie, and the tone overall is somewhat enigmatic. The central character John Baxter is in self-denial about his gift of the second-sight. The visual clues throughout the film foretell events yet to come but Baxter fights that which he fears is true; his frightening ability to see into the future. This of course results in an ending that is both unforgettable and entirely unpredictable.This is not really a film for everyone to be fair. Its pacing is slow and deliberate and it is more about atmospherics that action and thrills. Even its famous sex scene may disappoint many as it isn't really very erotic, more realistic and tender. Its two leads have tremendous chemistry and are both outstanding in quite complex roles. This is a fairly adult supernatural tale. One with many layers and meanings.",Don't Look Now

The film is not complex, it's not suspenseful nor is this movie a thriller. There is no deep symbolism nor anything to deeply ponder after watching. I can't believe I wasted my money to buy this movie because of all the good reviews and hype - why?The daughter dies wearing red, the couple move to Italy a few months later for his job, they meet two weird sisters - one who is a ""seer"" who tells the wife their daughter is happy. Later in the film the ""seer"" tells the wife their daughter is warning them they should leave the country and that her husband is a ""seer"" as well.

35,gridoon,More yawns than chills.,5,23 January 2000,"This movie is wildly overrated. I think that most of the viewers who call it ""wonderful"" or ""unforgettable"" actually recollect only some isolated effective sequences. But if you sit down and watch the whole thing from beginning to end, then it probably won't live up to its reputation; repeated viewings will only reveal even more weaknesses.As a psychological study, the film doesn't succeed; the characters are cold and lack depth. As a ""horror"" film, it doesn't succeed, either; it's almost never horrifying. And as a ""supernatural"" thriller, it's hampered by a poor script - there are too few ""weird"" events, considering that the movie depends almost exclusively on them. I'll be the first person to admit that the climax is stunning and chilling, even in the third viewing. But if you know how the story will turn out, there is another problem: the exceedingly slow, SLEEP-INDUCING pacing. As for the unexplained details, they don't frustrate me so much; I don't think director Roeg knows more about the meaning of this story than we do.As for the legendary love scene, yes, it IS bold and erotic and ""natural"". But it's also as redundant and unnecessary as any sex scene in the cheapest ""Friday The 13Th"" sequel or in the most pretentious ""art"" film.And stop searching for symbolic meanings related to the color red. Although it IS present in the film's two most important scenes, it is absent most of the time. If there is a color that makes a strong visual impression here, that's the color gray, without a doubt.",Don't Look Now
36,lost-in-limbo,A well-assembled mood piece.,9,16 May 2005,"A couple heads to Venice in winter and tries to recover after their daughter had drowned in a lake in their backyard in England. But in Vince they get flashes of someone in a red coat and a blind physic woman informs them of their dead daughter. Though, in Vince there's something sinister lurking around every corner and the couple receives some shocks.This is a very beautifully crafted supernatural thriller by director Nicolas Roeg. There is such flair and creativity in the texture and suspense of the film. It might come across as a pretentious exorcise. Though, you can't deny the direction is tremendously executed , with such subtleness and precision. This makes it compulsive viewing.The wintry Venice backdrop is simply harrowing in the detail, from the canals; tight passages ways and bridges that occupy the bleak city. It truly captures the evoking atmosphere of dread and discomfort felt throughout the film. While, the nightlife comes across as quite hollow and sinister, with dark and creepy lane ways, imposing shadows lurking and such dim lighting. You just don't know what's behind every corner. Making it definitely the showpiece and the enforcing backbone of the film.The story is a very riveting puzzle piece, which every single scene is really important in picking up small hints and symbols to where the story is heading. It's quite a slow driven story, but still it keeps one glued to the screen throughout. There are some obscure and unexplored themes left up in the air, but that gives it some sort of mystique. Like I typed before every little thing counts.This no roller coaster ride of fast paced thrills, but a slow burner that stirs up different types of emotions and believes to what's actually happening. As surrealism and reality is morphing into one and the couple is treading in a fine line in between both realms. It's haunting and quite depressing as you can feel coldness of the atmosphere that the characters are feeling.The eye for detail and visual texture is superb. The eerie visuals are definitely eye catching and have a great impact on keeping you at unease. There is such a bleak and depressing colour scheme of grey, brown and black, though the vibrant colour red holds such a high importance in the story. While, the infamously intrusive sex scene comes across as quite cold and a way to heal their emotional wounds of their dead child.The tension is superbly built up, in the use of the swirling and imposing camera-work e.g. the moving opening scene of their daughter's death. With real moody and sharp editing. There is also bone chilling and striking sound effects that fills every crevice of the film. The smooth and potent score is truly mesmerising in catching the anxiety and alienation of these couple's emotions in such a foreign place. While, the film finishes with such a gob-smacking climax, which is truly powerful and shocking. The creepy set-up to it also packs a harrowing or morbid feel.The performances by Sutherland and Christie are simply absorbing and brilliant in their portrayal of the hurting couple John and Laura Baxter. The same goes for Hilary Mason as Heather the blind physic and Clelia Matania as Wendy, the two elderly sisters that Laura bumps into and gets physic messages about her dead daughter Christine. This is definitely a film that needs repeat viewings to pick up on certain things and signs throughout the film.This is a sophisticated and unnerving puzzle of a film.",Don't Look Now
37,Lejink,Chronicle of a death foretold,8,18 June 2009,"One of the most unsettling films you'll ever see, I first saw Nic Roeg's ""Don't Look Now"" in my late teens and remember being blown away by it then. I don't usually like to re-watch movies even from years ago (there are so many unseen ones still to see!) but had no problem breaking my rule and casting my much older eye on it again.And it still blows me away! How many films genuinely make the hairs stand up on the back of your neck...well as Donald Sutherland's church architect character John Baxter acts out his destiny at the shocking conclusion, I found my hand going unconsciously to the back of my head, just as I'm sure it did all those years ago.The film has many themes, principally the power of the dead to affect the living, how adults cope (or otherwise) with the death of a child and if precognition is possible in a 20th Century world. Roeg posits all this and more in his film but doesn't lets up on the suspense either, never forgetting this is a thriller. The viewer, like Baxter and his wife Laura, convincingly played by Julie Christie, is constantly thrown off guard with a variety of unsettling situations, from the obvious device of uprooting the principals to a foreign environs, struggling to comprehend the local language, the hand-held camera shots as husband and wife both stumble lost around the serpentine not to mention labyrinthine ""streets"" of Venice and a supporting cast of characters none of whom appear wholly sympathetic to their plight. In addition, we get several interior shots in front of mirrors (an old trick from film noir), flocks of birds flying away everywhere (predating John Woo!) and scenes played and replayed reinforcing the almost trance like state the couple inhabit, almost like a waking nightmare. Popular tourist spot Venice, with a murderer also on the loose, suddenly seems a place fraught with danger and dread - what is it about this place and death (Visconti's ""Death in Venice"" was made at almost the same time)?There are several unforgettable scenes right throughout the film, from Sutherland's anguished cry of loss as he emerges literally from the depths, dead daughter in his arms, the brilliantly cool cross-cut scene of the couple making love through to the heart-stopping conclusion with Sutherland's confrontation of the murdering dwarf. The acting is superb throughout, not only Sutherland and Christie in the leads but also, in particular the actresses portraying the strange sisters who cast such a major presence in the narrative. For me the single most perplexing scene is the one where these two stoical ""old maid typical tourists"", having just convinced Julie Christie of the blind one's second sight are seen laughing outlandishly in their hotel room.I could go on and on - I haven't even got around to disseminating Roeg's continuing predilection for the colour red which is never more manifest than here. In total then, a great film by a maverick and under-appreciated director that works on a variety of levels and which deserves to be ranked among the very best that the 70's threw up.",Don't Look Now
38,ElMaruecan82,Occult and classy cult-classic,9,17 January 2012,"Johnny and his little sister Christine play in the country home while their parents are busy in the living room. John (Donald Sutherland), a hard-working architect is focussing on the restoration of a Venetian church while his wife Laura (Julie Christie) tries to find an answer to a trivial scientific question. The two parents are totally unaware of the tragedy about to happen, a tragedy foreshadowed by some very odd parallels made of falls, broken glasses, and Christine's raincoat whose bright red is mirrored in a stain on John's plans after he dropped a glass of wine on it. John instinctively senses the danger and runs to the pond for an atrocious discovery: Christine has drowned and all he can do is to exude a quasi-bestial groaning of shock and total disbelief  Nicholas Roeg's ""Don't Look Now"" is a treasure of imagery that would have been a delight for eyes if it wasn't so creepy. In fact, it might contain much more symbolism than needed, and ironically, this undeniable strength might also be the film's only weakness, as ""Don't Look Now"" combines both style and substance but sometimes it's so amazingly stylish that it doesn't leave the viewer some time to get in the philosophical core which is certainly its more fascinating aspect. Not to diminish the merit of the two leads who are remarkable as the grief-stricken Baxter couple, but ""Don't Look Now"" is one of these films whose success relies essentially on the peripheral elements. First, the movie 'lives' through a meticulous editing mixing between flashbacks and subliminal visions of the future in a dizzying visual orgy and secondly, the cinematography recreates a perfect nightmarish vision of Venice, through a sort of Gothic photography that reminds of another classic horror film from the same year.""Don't Look Now"" has such an unconventional way to play with images, action, that the line between reality and imagination, between trauma, facts and fear gets more uncertain as the plot progresses. So maybe (after all) the two lead performances do consecrate the movie's greatness more than any other artistic aspect. John and Laura embody a different kind of reaction toward death: Laura is a passionate and emotional woman who can only overcome her grief after meeting two elderly English sisters. One of them can't see but she's gifted with a psychic power and when she reveals that Christine is happy in the after-life, she provides the only emotional arguments that could appease Laura's wounded heart. John is more rational about the two English sisters, yet his very skepticism makes him more vulnerable because his mind can only find an illusion of peace, John is complex because he mirrors a condition opposite to the English sisters, he can see but he's 'emotionally' blind.This emotional blindness is featured more than once, and Roeg does a good job with portraying men as more awkward people, whether it's John, the church's Archbishop, the Police Chief, the communication never seems to go somewhere because they're too rational to believe that there are other strange forces operating in Venice. Indeed, we're far from the postcards' Venice or the pop-culture imagery, this one is shadowy, dirty, the perfect setting for a series of macabre events assembled in what seems to belong to a linear time-line: corpses dragged out of the water, accidents involving a falling movement or broken glasses, and a darkness and dullness of colors contrasting with some mysterious occurrences of a bright red figure appearing to john. The film writes many interrogation marks in our minds turning a mystery/thriller into a thought-provoking invitation to question our own visions and certitudes, and while Laura does, John does not.That's the root of the conflict which, if it doesn't kill the love between them, deprives it from any possibility of durable happiness. Which might explain the infamous sex scene, graphic for its time, and alternating between nudity and cuts showing the couple putting their clothes, the contrast between the passion and their quietness is striking and provoke a sort of intellectual seasickness, the proof that even the most passionate moments are meant to be ephemeral. The films oscillates between the passion and the thrills with a sort of Hitchcockian quality, and like in ""Vertigo"", the occult aspect creates the troubling mix of love and paranoia, both driven by their own opposite: truth and absence of truth. In Hitchcock films, we couldn't believe what the images meant, in ""Don't Look Now"", even the images are hard to believe.The whole film is a complicated puzzle, perfectly aware of its sophistication, and this might create an unsettling effect after the first viewing, although we can't help but having the certitude that this will lead somewhere, because the imagery contributes to a constant feeling of continuity. Whatever occupied the first scene comes back regularly: breaking glasses, falling, and a malfeasant presence. So when, the psychic lady predicts some horrific things to happen, we know this will be the pay-off of a patiently built up suspense. Is the conclusion going to satisfy the first viewers? I guess it's up to any of us to figure. As for me, I didn't think the ending redeemed the first part; because I thought everything was equally fascinating.But maybe I'm victim of my first impression, maybe the film demands several viewings and it's impossible to get all the meanings in one review, let alone after one viewing. I would find it even unfair to write some lines about this disturbing thriller, knowing that there are certainly many subtleties I didn't get, or some hints or clues that went unnoticed. So should I review it or wait after at least a second viewing. I sincerely don't know  even now, I'm torn between two totally different opinions, one that praises the artistic accomplishment, and another that focuses on the actors' performances. I guess the magic of the film hides somewhere between these two aspects",Don't Look Now
39,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Can't look away.,6,18 September 2019,"'Don't Look Now (1973)' is always interesting even if it isn't exactly entertaining or, even, particularly engaging. This is mostly thanks to its assured, ahead-of-its-time direction and equally-as-innovative editing. The movie makes frequent use of match-cuts and time-compression to create a foreboding sense of fate and a palpable sense of pace within the very fabric of the film. You're also never quite sure what is really going on. Are certain characters acting out of malice or virtue? Is the narrative is based around the natural or the supernatural (or a combination of both)? Is this now, or is this then? The fact that you're constantly on your toes makes for a rather compelling experience, even when it takes a turn for the dull. The picture is really quite slow, crawling through its first one-and-a-half acts after an incredible opening. Its horror is also very slight, to the point that one could easily miss the most terrifying moment if they aren't paying full attention. Plus, the ultimate pay-off just isn't all that scary, feeling like it plays to fears that, as a society, simply don't exist anymore. Still, the concept and its execution are undeniably intriguing; they're somehow both subtle and over-the-top. The end-result is a piece that keeps you watching even though isn't always entertaining. It's not the best in its genre, but it's just about beguiling enough to recommend. 6/10",Don't Look Now
40,secondtake,"Artsy and surreal but a thriller, too...a unique British twist on New Hollywood",9,31 July 2010,"Don't Look Now (1973)A tale told with the new realism of the times, emphasizing genuine people, small details to add credibility, and a filming and acting style that is vivd and yet everyday. But that's only half of it. Add a surreal and sometimes disorienting editing that adds dreams and flashforwards, add some camera-work that is abstract or off kilter, and stir in a general ominousness where almost everyone is a little creepy or suspect.You may not figure out what the title means (I didn't) but all the confusions of the plot do, actually, click together by the very end. It's really rather simple, and this elegance is beautiful, internally, helping justify what sometimes feels like a patient, if not long, movie.And yet it never loses interest. What it creates at those times when the events are not changing is a feeling of pure ambiance. Of course, the ""mise-en-scene"" is purely Venice, and the best of Venice, the winding, aging, gorgeous alleys and canals. And an decrepit church, the center in one sense of the plot. The core of the story is a short story by a master of popular, romantic intrigues, Daphne du Maurier (who also wrote Rebecca). She has said that of all the film adaptations of her works, she only liked Don't Look Now and Rebecca.This won't be to everyone's taste, due to the abstracted style and a sense at times that ""nothing"" is happening. But if it starts to click, which it did for me, and you can just watch and know it gets more and more interesting, go with it.

There are some odd moments to the direction and Nicolas Roeg has a strange way of cutting and editing.So many people has said so many great things about this movie but I honestly couldn't see them. You'd have to be a fool to not know the outcome at the end. Also the film seems to be in the same league as all those Redemption titles from the 70's.

Here and there, some movies thrilled me, but for the most part, '70s were painfully boring to me. This one is no exception. At one point, I thought - I saw more than half the movie but still nothing happens - and then realized that I only watched it for thirty minutes out of a total of two hours. I can not recall half an hour that lasted longer. Stretched and chopped sex scene in this segment of the film is anything but sexy, it is totally unnecessary and in no way contributes to the film, except that it gives it another distinguished mark of that decade.For some reason, many consider this movie one of the best films and most memorable horrors of all time. It's classified as a horror thriller, but it's neither scary nor tense. Well filmed and acted but somewhat boring drama, the story of which hardly makes sense. The characters' actions are quite pointless and unconvincing, and the whole thing looks to me like a misunderstanding between Argento and Lynch.5/10",Don't Look Now

Naturally - being a horror fan - I was curious.Uhm, creepy? No. Mysterious? Yes. This might have been considered creepy or haunting back in the day, but certainly not by today's standards. I found the film slow moving and rather weird, with the most unconventional editing. There's a lengthy sex scene and I can't help but wonder whether it was really necessary. Every scene drags as if I was watching it in slow motion. At times it even appeared as if the characters themselves had very little motivation. Donald Sutherland tried as hard as he could, but I didn't feel the sense of urgency I expected from his character given his situation. The entire film lacked energy and emotion.Julie Christie's character, Laura, was so all over the place that she became just too much. Was she really all she appeared to be? I'm clearly missing the point, as the film didn't make much sense to me as a whole. There obviously are cryptic clues, but I wasn't interested enough to analyze them. A lot will no doubt make more sense with a second viewing, but why should a film need more than one viewing to fully understand or appreciate it?

46,sol-,My brief review of the film,10,8 January 2005,"An exquisitely haunting, very memorable drama, this is a uniquely directed, well acted and superbly photographed film of searching for what feels to be missing, and the tragic results that can occur. The Italian setting provides the film with a strong sense of the Gothic but also an ominous sense of otherness. In a foreign land with different customs, culture and architecture, the characters feel lost, but yet the mysterious, unknown element of the new setting provides a sense of hope. The director has used a number of tricks to emphasise certain details. These may have no meaning at the time, but their re-occurrence throughout the film adds to the haunting atmosphere. The film also has this amazing power to make almost anything seem foreboding and sinister. There is an undeniable musty B-grade feel to the film, but there is so much else to admire here, that it does not detract at all from the viewing experience. It is an intriguing, gripping and powerful watch.",Don't Look Now

Nicolas Roeg's intercutting of almost continuous bits of action throughout is one of the more interesting stylistic touches in DON'T LOOK NOW. The cinematography is breathtaking: has Venice ever looked so beautiful on film before (or since)? I doubt it. That most of it is hand-held is even more impressive; it gives everything a Real Time feel, allowing the viewer to immerse themselves in what's happening- we're ""there"" when something happens, we ""see"" it and are swept up in it. The only problem I've ever had with the movie is that the basic storyline is so clichéd (and the resolution so... contrived). Otherwise, DON'T LOOK NOW is a classic worth a look.",Don't Look Now
48,BaronBl00d,Somewhere on that Fence,6,16 October 2010,"While I can appreciate some of the editing, the visuals, and the directorial license of Nicolas Roeg, I cannot agree that this film is one of the all-time horror greats nor is it a great film. Good film? Perhaps. I really need to see this a couple more times to possibly fully understand everything that happens and what everything might have been intended for. movies like this are a lot of work, and that isn't necessarily a bad thing nor necessarily a good thing. I like a movie that makes one think, but I don't like one being forced down my throat as being great art just because I may not see it the way you do. I see there is quite some division with reviewers' responses on this film. A truly bad film would not do that either. So...for form's sake and because some of the film's scenes are very powerful, I will sit on that figurative fence leaning slightly more to good art rather than just mediocre. The director Roeg gets a lot of good credit for his visual artistry from the opening scenes involving the little blonde girl with the red mac to the stain on the stained glass photo to the truly magnificent and haunting views of Venice. Roeg paints his canvas with detail and color. He also overdoes it as well. The lengthy love-making scene for overblown, unnecessary, and a huge detractor from the atmosphere of the film. I kept thinking to myself - My God will this ever end! Roeg's evident skill with a camera lens does not always translate into good story-telling. I have not read the very short Daphne Du Maurier story but know that it and this must be completely different in many regards. Roeg gets us going early with the death of the child and then we have these long, very often poorly transitioned scenes in Venice until things start heating up in the final third. the movie seemed very long though it is just under two hours. It felt like two-and-a-half. That is because Roeg's pace is sometimes catatonic. I, for one, like the pay-off. I could see that Roeg had tied up lots of loose-ends and appreciate the thought that went in to that. I enjoyed Sutherland and Christie in the leads, and I really liked Hilary Mason as the blind sister/prophet and her Italian-playing an Englishwoman sister Clelia Mantania. They were respectively creepy as were all of their scenes. I would not NOT recommend the film to anyone that liked to think when they watch a film. Clearly the film, at least the first time, did not resonate with me like it has for others. For that i was somewhat disappointed like when I saw Roman Polanski's The Tenant - a film I thought incredibly overrated. this film may be just that too.",Don't Look Now

Found it to be a crappy film. Was even laughing at Donald Sutherland's hairstyle n the end scene.
In fact I found George C Scott's The Changeling much better than this film during that time. Both the films r based on the theme of grief. The Changeling was able to hold my attention but this film wasn't.
Revisted this film recently on a dvd n was able to comprehend the ending.
From the technical point of view, it is a very well shot film, the acting is good, the editing, especially during the sex scene gave inspiration to George Clooney's Out of Sight, the fragmented scenes must have inspired Memento.
The film was innovative during it's time. Even the psychological plot was much ahead of it's time but overall this film is not exactly a horror film.

51,jzappa,"A Sad, Grim, Cerebral Drama",8,11 August 2008,"Don't Look Now accomplishes one of the deepest and most difficult fears humans have. If your instinct tells you something that society, logic, reason, and ego all tell you are ridiculous, what do you do? When you take notice of something that no one else believes, the same things that tell you your instincts are ridiculous are again in question. It is no surprise to me that the film's concept was created by Daphne Du Maurier, the author of the famed Gothic psychological thriller Rebecca, which was adapted into a movie by Hitchcock, for Don't Look Now seems very likely to attract Hitchcock to the helm, with its ominous suspense, glimpsed details, sudden moments of tension, and the plot itself. Only Nicolas Roeg directs instead, and not so incomparably to the aforementioned master.This disturbing, cerebral drama tells the story of a couple, Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland, whose young daughter has recently drowned in a tragic accident at home, the grief from which applies tension to their marriage. In search of a change of scenery and a chance to work through their pain, they take a working vacation to Venice, where Sutherland has been contracted to restore an ancient church. While he works, Christie is befriended by two strange elderly sisters. One of the sisters is blind and claims to be in psychic contact with her dead daughter. Christie is drawn to the sisters, but Sutherland finds their influence on her unsettling and suspects them of deceit. The ensuing drama is set against a subplot involving a serial killer who has eluded the police. You have no idea where it goes from there. Or at least I hope you don't.An appealing motif of Roeg's sad, grim composition is his dream-like ambiance and his patient attention to the heartbroken couple. Even apart from flashback sequences, flash forwards, elements of clairvoyance and premonitions, and other such individual considerations, there is definitely an impressionistic melody, remarked upon in part by one of Pino Donaggio's best scores, and Roeg's seemingly unostentatious, courageous sex scene between Sutherland and Christie is an extensive episode wherein subtext can either be found or felt, because instead of stagnancy, the scene brings flavor.",Don't Look Now
52,jtindahouse,A bizarre and brilliant ride,9,10 May 2017,"I love it when you come across a film in which you can tell the director is in complete control. Directors like Stanley Kubrick, Brian De Palma and Nicolas Roeg are some of the first that come to mind. It seems that so much thought goes into every scene, yet the thinking isn't always lateral. They have an ability to make what would otherwise be a completely ordinary scene, something utterly unique and thought-provoking. The end product is almost always a delight to watch and what Roeg has produced here with 'Don't Look Now' is no exception.There's quite a bizarre feel watching this film. From the rather odd characters (not just the small parts either, but the lead roles as well), the Italian language that is rarely explained to us what is actually being said, and an odd story that isn't entirely clear where it is going. If handled wrongly, all this could equal an absolute mess of a film. However in the case of 'Don't Look Now', Roeg keeps us convinced that he has some tricks up his sleeve, and this makes for a very fun viewing experience trying to work out where exactly this is all headed.Where it is headed is to a quite brilliant ending. I'll admit I had to go back and watch the ending again to make sure I fully understood what I had just witnessed. This only confirmed to me though that it was indeed an ingenious way to finish the film. This is the type of movie that either demands you go back and watch it again, or else leaves you thinking about it for days to come.'Don't Look Now' may not be for everyone. I imagine it to be quite a polarising film in that way. If you aren't enjoying it in the early stages, chances are you aren't really going to enjoy it at all. I can only assure you that it is worth persisting with and just excepting the oddness that will creep up at times. A really good film that deserves all the recognition it gets.",Don't Look Now
53,BeneCumb,"Good acting, camera-work and soundtrack, but not so interesting plot",6,31 October 2012,"Which amazed me a bit as the name Daphne du Maurier is usually a quality mark; or is it the directing, could e.g. Alfred Hitchcock have created a more interesting progression? Well, you are constantly reckoning on something to happen, but nothing really did or the outcome was just trivial (the John Baxter related scene up in the church).The main actors (Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie) are great, of course, and their famous erotic mix scene has become a classic, copied or parodied in various later movies. Use of Venice is also a good finding, but I was somewhat perplexed how shabby and crumbling the city was even in the beginning of 1970ies.Consequently, the film was smooth to follow, but it was neither occult nor haunting to me and when the ending credits appeared I realised I had just seen a film with people having mind problems due to tragic events.",Don't Look Now
54,Polaris_DiB,Psychic tremblings,10,3 April 2007,"Nicolas Roeg's third movie is about the closest to a genre film I've seen him get: a thriller/horror about a couple struggling with the accidental drowning of their daughter go to Venice and submerge themselves in anxiety and grief, which manifests in different ways. The woman (played excellently by Julie Christie) runs into a blind medium and starts taking almost obsessive comfort out of her insistence that the daughter is fine and happy, while the man (Donald Sutherland, also played excellently) tries to convince his wife that their daughter is dead while still being unable to keep himself from seeing her form (in the aspect of a red raincoat) out of the corner of his eye.Roeg himself submerges into a much more arcane focus on mysticism and cultist aspects--things that reveal themselves throughout his work, but normally not as strikingly as here. He also does the finest camera work I've seen in a long time. How he managed to keep such an active and immersive cinematography while in the confines of the claustrophobic streets of Venice! (and before digital video!) The shot where Julie Christie collapses is stunning, itself as shocking and jarring as many of the cuts that Roeg uses (Roeg is a master of deranged editing that follows a logic one often doesn't want to engage in but finds oneself helplessly enrapt with).Finally, the very weird and perverse way that characters seem to always be reacting to manifestations beyond their current presence underlines the anxiety felt in this film. This aspect of the script I appreciate not for its metaphysical notions but because I'm so familiar with PTSD and the way that traumatic events fold into themselves. Roeg's habit of folding narrative time and space, connecting often an event in the beginning of the film with an event at the end, thus causing an ineffable circle, is much more direct and perverse this time around, mostly because of the thriller genre aspect of this film.--PolarisDiB",Don't Look Now

I kinda think there is. And, by mistake, I grossly erred and picked up the utterly stinky version of DLN (which was nothing but a big heap of crap). And, because of that misjudgement, I missed out on seeing the totally wonderful version of DLN that everyone else is watching, and raving about, and giving 9 & 10-star ratings to.Is this what happened? It must be so. 'Cause it's the only thing that makes any sense to me why I found this version of DLN to be so bad that it wasn't even worth using to blow my nose on. It really wasn't.Of course, while watching DLN, it didn't help matters for me, at all, that it starred the likes of Donald Sutherland who has got to be one of the most talentless, putrid, and unconvincing actors of his generation, bar none.And, naturally, here in DLN, that droopy-eyed doofus, Donald (wearing an utterly hideous wig, no less) didn't let me down once as he incompetently put in yet another dull and forgettable performance, just like he's done in every other picture that I've ever seen him in.By the way - When it comes to discussing this film's title (which is ""Don't Look Now"") - I can't tell you how much I hate movies that use a catchy, ominous-sounding title as a cheap ploy to spark one's interest, only for the viewer to find out after watching the stupid thing that its title had absolutely no relevance to the story, whatsoever. (Sheesh! Give me a break, already!) Anyways - When it came to the grave danger that Sutherland's character was clearly warned about earlier in the story - It wasn't the person who was behind this deadly danger that sought him out.

56,JasparLamarCrabb,Doom in Venice,7,24 February 2013,"Nicolas Roeg's film version of the Daphne Du Maurier story is not an easy film to watch. Though very unsettling, it's not an out and out horror film. A couple (Julie Christie & Donald Sutherland) struggle to come to grips with the drowning death of their daughter. While staying in Venice (he's restoring a church) they meet a blind psychic, who claims to have seen the girl and informs them that she's very happy. While this is a great comfort to Christie, it unsettles Sutherland to the core. The performances by these two are astounding...so is the chemistry (the film has a now famous love scene that lives up to its steamy reputation). Christie is dynamite, exuding a lot of warmth, with no trace of the kooky mod persona she'd cultivated in the '60s. Hilary Mason is perfect as the psychic.

They move across to Venice as John is working over there restoring a church. Whilst in Venice, Laura strikes up a conversation with 2 sisters (one of whom is blind, but claims to have the gift of second sight). The blind sister warns Laura that John is in danger and that he must leave Venice, but when Laura warns John that he is in danger he dismisses the warning as pure hokum and remains in Venice, but at what cost?I do enjoy a good psychological horror film, but in order for it to work (as far as I'm concerned) there needs to be a certain amount of character depth or insight in order for me to able to care or understand how a character feels, but for the most part these things are absent in Don't Look Now...The tragedy of a child's death is the framework that sets the story up and this is good as it does get the audience onside with the grieving couple - the average viewer will at the very least feel some empathy for their loss. However, after the strong set-up something goes slightly awry...The film then goes in a very weird direction with the wife getting a little too involved with the sisters and the husband getting strange visions... from a cinematic point of view this is good (director Nicholas Roeg takes full advantage in making these visions as creepy and as terrifying as possible), but narratively it's weak as the screenplay gives us no real insights into the thoughts of anyone concerned - the wife, the husband, the blind sister. There's just nothing there in all honesty and to me it was all shock value.As the grieving couple, Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland are both excellent and the final 15 minutes do pack an intensity that was clearly absent for the majority of the running time. However, on balance I found that the weaknesses outweighed the strengths and it saddens me to report 'Don't Look Now' as being little more than another 'overrated classic film'",Don't Look Now

Anyone who truly appreciates the art of horror will recognise this film for what it is: a classic. The atmosphere in this film is incredible for many reasons: Pino Donaggio's haunting score, the wintry Venice location work, the fragmented and thoughtful editting, and the perfect performances. Add to that the most unforgettable twist ending ever filmed (to date, anyway) and you're looking at a tremendous film. Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie play a couple who go to Venice to recover from the traumatic death of their daughter (she drowned in a pond at the bottom of their garden). They keep seeing a small red-coated figure wandering around the canals, and Sutherland convinces himself that it may be the spirit of his daughter trying to make contact from the other side. However, when he confronts the red-coated figure he is in for one hell of a shock.... Nicholas Roeg's film is a masterpiece. It can be viewed over and over again and with each new viewing it throws up new surprises and possibilities.

60,drownnnsoda,One Of the Better Psychological Thrillers Of It's Time.,8,1 September 2006,"""Don't Look Now"" is a strange little movie. The plot is about John and Laura Baxter, a young couple living in England. While looking through his slides of his previous work one day (he is a restoration architect), John notices a red-cloaked figure in a church that he restored. Reminding him of his daughter, who is playing outside, he instinctively rushes outside, to find his little girl has drowned in the pond. Now, sometime later, John and Laura are staying in Venice, Italy, while John does some work on an old Cathedral. Laura begins meeting with a psychic woman and her sister, who claims she sees the Baxter's young daughter. John think's it's rubbish, and dismisses the whole idea. But strange things start to happen to John, after the psychic warns that he is not safe in Venice and that something awful is about to happen - he has a horrible accident while working at the church, and begins seeing the red-cloaked figure he saw in his slide all around the backstreets of Venice. Who is this mysterious cloaked figure? Although ""Don't Look Now"" is probably most noted for it's graphic sex scene between Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie, this film has much more to offer. While, I don't think this film is a complete masterpiece like many seem to, I found ""Don't Look Now"" to be a well-written, intelligent little horror film. Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie are both excellent in the film, they play their characters believably and well. The atmosphere is to die for, the foggy backstreets and dark alleyways of Venice play a major role in the film, giving it a brooding and uncomfortable feeling. The little figure that John chases through the streets, hidden behind a red rain slicker is really eerie. It strongly reminded me of 1976's ""Alice, Sweet Alice"", but since ""Dont Look Now"" was released in '73, I'm guessing ""Alice, Sweet Alice"" took some inspiration from this film. The film's both share similarities, most notably the rain slicker element and the subtle religious themes throughout, although they are lighter in this film. The film's finale was macabre and unexpected. Just when you think the killer's identity is going to be revealed - well, it is - it's just not what one would think it would be. But that's one of the neatest things about the film, is how it inverts your expectations and makes things all a matter of coincidence. Overall, ""Don't Look Now"" is an above-average thriller with first-rate performances from both Sutherland and Christie, and an eerie atmosphere with a great story. Sure, the film has a little bit of a slow build, but what gives? The tension and suspense that builds with it is what makes the movie so eerie, and the shocker of an ending is wonderful. Recommended to fans of subtle horror slightly on the more elegant side. 8/10.",Don't Look Now

I was half expecting some sort of weird cult thing like 'Rosemary's Baby' or 'The Wicker Man', especially the way that the supporting cast were all acting and maybe that was deliberate, but I don't think it was clear enough or took you on the journey that they were trying to imply.I'm also not sure that the 'famous' (I knew nothing about it) sex scene was necessary or added anything to the film either. For someone of my 'Harry Potter/Hunger Games' generation, it felt quite strange to see President Snow giving it to Madam Rosmerta in such an oddly filmed way and with no apparent point.Psychological horror is not really my thing at the best of times, but that's ok, because I'm not really sure that there's any psychological issues anyway or horror for that matter. I think it's all based on one vision (Not the Queen song, but a psychic one) and it might be that you're supposed to be amazed by that as the final scene, but it just didn't excite or vaguely even frighten me at all, except perhaps for Donald's wig.I suppose that they all act it well, if a little weird in places, however there is a lot of talking over each other and confusion which could make it difficult to follow if it hadn't been such a dull story in the first place.107.71/1000.",Don't Look Now
65,truemythmedia,Superb,8,26 November 2019,"This movie reminded me a lot of the film ""Hereditary."" I wouldn't be at all surprised to find out that just as Ari Aster drew on ""The Wicker Man"" when creating ""Midsommar,""so did he draw on ""Don't Look Now"" when writing ""Hereditary.""This movie opens with a scene depicting John (Donald Sutherland, ""Fallen"") and Laura's daughter drowning in the back yard of their estate. It is very creatively done and a foreshadow of the way that Nicolas Roeg (""The Man Who Fell to Earth"") will handle much of the paranormal elements of this film. We never actually see her fall in, hear her fall in, and nothing happens to even alert her mother as to the trouble. However, John gets a sense that something is wrong when blood seems to appear on one of the slides he is looking at through a projector. He follows his instinct and runs outside but he is too late to save his daughter.This scene sets the stage perfectly for the film by establishing life and death stakes, the existence of the paranormal, and the separation between John and Laura, the main couple in the film, as Laura has no idea anything is even happening till it is all over, or does she.The rest of the movie picks up some weeks or months later with John and Laura (Julie Christie, ""Doctor Zhivago"") in Venice where John is working on the restoration of a church. It is here among the decay of a crumbling city that the rest of the film will play out.Laura and John each try to deal with the loss of their daughter in their own ways, throwing themselves into work, seeking comfort in each other, and consulting with priests and psychics. Through it all, there is an overwhelming feeling of dread. Sometimes it feels like the loss of their daughter is hovering over them and blanketing them with sadness or paranoia but at other times it seems that John especially is in terrible danger from some force or another trying to kill him.If you are the sort of person that wants the plot to be neatly wrapped up and every loose end tied neatly back and tucked into the whole then you will not like this movie. Very few answers are offered. The film is far more concerned with creating and atmosphere of confusion and decay. Luckily, it does this expertly.I suppose I am guessing a little here but it seems like Roeg is trying to link this confusion and crumbling city facade to the pain of losing a child and the absolute gut ripping that experience must be. In this, I find the movie to be unsuccessful. While the individual parts are done well and certainly the atmosphere established almost perfectly it is the failure to connect these emotions to ideas or experiences that are larger than the film that keeps it from being a masterpiece in my eyes.Certainly, if you just want an atmospheric horror film then you can't go wrong here. If what you want is a film that points you to some other inner reality or meaning then I'm afraid you might be disappointed.",Don't Look Now

67,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Interesting Psychological Thriller About Loss,8,21 February 2019,"This was a film I heard about on podcasts I listen to and it really intrigued me. The 1970's are an era where there are a lot of blank spots in my viewing history and from what I gathered; this film is one of the bests. The official synopsis for this film is a married couple, grieving the recent death of their young daughter, is in Venice when they encounter two elderly sisters, one of whom is psychic and brings a warning from beyond.We kick this off with a young girl playing outside in a red raincoat. She is Christine Baxter (Sharon Williams). Inside are her parents, Laura (Julie Christie) and John (Donald Sutherland. They're both quite intelligent from the conversation they're having and we see that John restores old churches. There's a slide he is looking at that gets water on it and it gets a red smudge. Something catches his attention and he knows there's something wrong outside. We also meet Johnny (Nicholas Salter), their other child. John finds their daughter in the water and has drowned. He tries to save her to no avail.The film then shifts to Venice. John is working on restoring a church and we learn that he isn't overly happy; he doesn't think it is as old as he thought. He meets his wife for lunch and we see that their relationship is a bit rocky. He doesn't seem to be paying attention to her. He goes to open a window and dirt gets into the eye of Wendy (Clelia Matania). Her blind sister, Heather (Hilary Mason), tries to help, but can't. Laura decides to help as well. It is in the bathroom that Laura learns Heather is psychic. She states that Christine is sitting between her and her husband and is happy.Laura takes a seat in the bathroom, before returning to John. She then passes out. She is much happier after talking with the two sisters, but John doesn't believe what they are saying. He tries to keep his wife away from them. All the while, there is a murderer in Venice and someone who is wearing a coat that is a similar height to Christine. How does this all fit together?So coming in I did have an idea of the story. I knew this couple was dealing with loss, so I'll start there. They are handling it in much different ways. John is working more than he probably should while Laura is trying to move on. It isn't until she believes that the two sisters are telling her things they couldn't know that she starts to be happier. There is a long sex scene between the couple, but it is edited in way that shows them getting ready to go out to dinner. I took this as they are starting to move on with their lives finally, even though John doesn't believe them.Something I did find interesting is the murderer that is a subplot to the film. I heard a podcast say that no matter how many times he sees this film, he forgets about that part of the story. I have to admit, I came in looking for it, but I forgot about it in stretches as well. I find this interesting though, because it is important to the story. The title of the film ties in with this for sure.Going off of this, Heather admits that she normally cannot summon the dead. She does try and ends up having some kind of seizure from it. What is interesting about this, I wonder how much of the events that happen wouldn't if she doesn't come into the lives of John and Laura. There is also the interesting angle that John might be psychic as well, but he ignores his abilities.Now I'm going to warn you, this film is a slow-burn. I would even say that this film is slower than many films to the point where I even noticed it. Interesting though, the tension builds along with the story. I found myself trying to figure things out as they are happening. I would still say the film could be trimmed a bit, but not by much. There are some things that are extremely important and tie back in at different times. I thought the ending was interesting and didn't necessarily expect it.I definitely have to commend the acting for this one. Christie is great as the mother who is grieving, but doing a great job of hiding it. She doesn't really have a job from what I gather, but she is intelligent. She also is in a strange country while not knowing the language and her other child is in school away from her. Sutherland is also great and he buries himself in his work. We see that when he thinks the church isn't what he though, he is disappointed, like he needs it to be great. Some crazy things happen to him that I found to be interesting. I thought Mason and Matania were solid as the two sisters. The rest of the cast were solid and round out the film for what was needed in building the tension and story.As for the effects of the film, there really aren't a lot used. We do get a little bit of blood, which looked a bit orange, but you see that a lot for the era and I love it. There are some effects, which I really hope Sutherland actually did, because that just makes him even better in my eyes. I also thought the film was shot very well and more of the cool things come from the editing for sure.The last thing to touch on before wrapping up this review would be the score of the film. I thought it was actually really good. It fits the scenes for what was needed and helps to give scenes an uneasy vibe. A lot of things come later in the film, but we do get some spots early on as well. It is one that I will look into finding to listen to while writing.Now with that said, for my first time watch of this film, I thought it was interesting. There is a story here that isn't new, but something that is quite sad and realistic. I really like seeing how these people are dealing with the death of a child and then Laura befriending this blind woman to help her with closure. The film is a slow-burn, so keep that in mind. I do think they could have gave us more of the killer angle as it kind of seems pushed to the back until later. The film does have a good feel that is really helped by the great acting. The score is solid and even though there's not a lot in the way of effects, the ones we do get are good. I also thought the film was shot very well. I think this is a good film and one that I will revisit again now that I know how things play out for sure. I would recommend this film if you like slow-burns for sure.",Don't Look Now

70,nycritic,Look Closer,10,11 August 2006,"When a man cannot see what is right in front of him, he is doomed to experience the irrational horror that follows suit. John Baxter (Donald Sutherland) is such a man, intent on his work, unable -- or unwilling -- to see that a photograph of a cathedral holds an unexplained red image, and that this very image will be a constant connection with him and his own mortality.Nicholas Roeg's horror masterpiece DON'T LOOK NOW is such a story, in which clues are interspersed throughout, but the protagonist refuses to acknowledge them. Right at the start of the movie we see how busy he is, working at his images, his wife Laura (Julie Christie) barely even a presence, as his two children Christine and Johnny play in the garden that also includes a small lake (or large pond). Christine, dressed in a red raincoat, is playing dangerously close to this pond. Her ball falls in the water; she attempts to retrieve it at the moment when Johnny rides his bike over a piece of glass, shatters it. John spills a glass of water over a picture he'd been eyeballing -- a picture of a cathedral containing the unexplained figure in red. The liquid we (and he, we assume) see, is blood, issued from the figure in red, spreading menacingly. At that moment, John runs out to rescue Christine, but it's too late; she is drowned, and his cry of anguish is truly horrifying.Almost immediately we've taken to Venice, some time later, where the Baxters reside as he works on a Cathedral. Laura becomes acquainted with two women, sisters, one of them who is psychic who informs them that their daughter is happy and with them. Laura faints from the reaction -- she is overwhelmed, maybe even touched by that otherworldly essence of the paranormal and willing to accept, because when she comes to, she is a changed woman. She's more alive, less sad, and open to the idea that her dead daughter is only dead in the body but alive in spirit, and okay. John, however, argues with her. He cannot accept such things. He's an architect, working with the tangible, the visible. Spirits and psychics have no room in his world.At the edges of the story, a series of murders are being committed. On one of them, a little figure in a red raincoat appears running in the dense Venetian night. John has seen this figure, and Roeg keeps using this particular shade of red even in inconsequential scenes to keep the connection alive that there is an ulterior motive that he and Laura are in Venice, and that something evil this way comes.There is an interesting analogy of how men and women confront the unexplained, intentional or not. Women -- or the feminine -- has always been linked to perception, whether men -- or the masculine -- is inexorably linked to action and logic. Once the investigation on the murders take place, none of the men seem to know other than what they see -- which is nothing, an unsolvable puzzle. John is caught in between the two: he is (obviously) male, working in a masculine profession, but there is a part of him that he denies, and the irony is that such a denial costs him dearly. The two sisters and Laura are open to what is not there even when only Heather is able to see the horror even as she cannot verbalize it.Throughout it all, red, red, red. Snippets of it, splashes of it, always hand in hand with water and reflection and what perfect locale than a city of water -- Venice -- and its aura of mystery. Christine of course if the harbinger, but so is that unexplained image in that picture which ""logic"" cannot concisely make out. In horror, logic can go out the window, and this is a prime example of bending the hands of time -- with flash forwards, flashbacks, and dream images -- to have John take that Final step into the realm of the irrational and confront what he's been chasing all this time: his own destiny. If the very revelation of the little figurine is something of a letdown it can't detract from the jolt we feel: we can't react immediately, and then the barrage of images that form the puzzle that was there all along.

Unfortunately, this film is quite predictable. Like many other studios, this film was released in January, 1974; right after ""The Exorcist"". So many people leapt upon the ""Satanic horror"" genre during this era. In general, this genre may have made a lot of money for studios. However, no one could make a film which could equal the sheer terror of William Friedkin's direction of William Peter Blatty's best-selling novel, ""The Exorcist"" (1973). In my opinion, that is the most horrifying film in cinema history. I put ""Alien"" (1979 next. After this, many films are excellent. This is not one of them.",Don't Look Now
72,pc95,Original for it's Time,7,11 July 2013,"Being almost 40 years old, Nicholas Roeg's ""Don't Look Now"" is ahead of it's time in it's story-telling and cinematography. It features a young Julie Christie, and younger Donald Sutherland, and succeeds in creating a creepy environment in the meld of Omen without as much reliance on Christianity. Without giving too much away, the movie sleekly fits in it's own set of mysteries and ties it together well. There were 3 minor things that looked poor or needed to be edited much better. One, Sutherland's character's clown suit purple, two the awful fake blood (you'll know), and finally a ridiculously long gratuitous sex scene with the leads. Still a decent older entry into the super-natural genre. 7/10",Don't Look Now

I mean, geeze, even after his love making scene (10 minutes), he walks around naked, weighs himself in the nude and then goes to work in his office COMPLETELY NUDE! Other than this, the movie was great. The sisters were creepy and that scene where they are both on a boat was very creepy and I was scared beyond measure.

75,blumdeluxe,Supernatural,5,7 September 2017,"""Don't look now"" tells the story of a married couple that lives its life in Venice, Italy, after the couple's young daughter died in a terrible accident short time back. When the wife meets two elderly sisters, one of which is blind as says to have supernatural powers, things take a turn to the mysterious and a small person in just the same red coat the young girl was wearing is seen again and again, wandering through the dark scenery of the city.I'm not really sure what to make of this movie. On the one hand it comes with a decent cast and is carefully produced for its time. On the other hand it largely depends on supernatural concepts like foreseeing and I'm really not a big fan of such topics in film. The blind lady that has other, hyper-natural powers is probably a classic theme and can't be called very creative. One of the problems is that actually not really much happens throughout the plot, everything leads to the ending scene, that I'm not sure I fully understood. There are, however, some clues along the way that add an element of mystery, which I like. The end then comes surprising and has its shocking value. The film thus has its moments but they are not constant enough to really give you a thrill-ride or anything close to one.All in all I think that many people will see more in that movie, will come up with theories how to read it and why it is superb in its way. However, I have to say that I would have preferred a more realistic plot that comes with more frequent thrills and less calm sequences.",Don't Look Now
76,Stephen_A_Abell,"Don't Look Now, Here Comes A Gallo Wannabe... But Deflates From The Start...",4,21 January 2021,"Greetings and salutations and welcome to my review of 1973's Don't Look Now.Before I get into the review, here are my ratings for the movie.The story gets 1 out of 2:
The Direction a 1.25:
The Pacing receives a 0.25:
While the Acting gets 1.25:
And my Enjoyment level earns a 0.5 out of 2:Don't Look Now, therefore, receives a total of 4.25 out of 10.This film irritates me, and not in a little way. I remember watching the movie when I was a teenager and recall how people gushed over it. I didn't get it then, and I don't get it now. Even the title is incorrect. I still cannot fathom why they use, Don't Look Now, as the title because it has nothing to do with the story. For all one knows it's a warning to the viewers to stay away.The fundamental reason is that director Nicolas Roeg appears to be wary of classifying this film in a specific genre. For example, there's a ghost story here, though there's no tension or eeriness. Additionally included is a drama that should be loaded with loss, worry, and grieving, but there's little emotion. Lastly, the bolt-on thriller should have created more interest for the viewer. Roeg's indecisiveness offers the viewers a rather wishy-washy picture. Granted, he infuses the whole thing with some exceedingly nice eye-candy and iconic shots. However, these are not enough.It's not fair to lay all of this at Roeg's feet though as I'm confident the screenwriters, Allan Scott and Chris Bryant had their faux-pas too. The leading one being the ending. Oh, my God, it's such a silly ending you may feel yourself cringing and shaking your head in dismay, as I did. The one thing they couldn't handle however is realistic depictions of people and emotions. The two prime players in this nasty and sordid tale are Laura and John Baxter. The Baxter's are parents of two lovely children. So what makes this nasty, and sordid(?) It's their lack of love or feelings for their kids. Apart, from the scene where John scoops his dead daughter from the local pond, I feel these two genuinely shouldn't have sired children. With the daughter dead and buried, they bung their poor son into a boarding school, and we only see him for thirty-seconds when he has an accident and Laura rushes home to check on him. However, no sooner has she found out he's okay then she's hopping on the next flight back to Italy. She doesn't even say goodbye to the unfortunate sod. I wanted to slap her at that moment.I do dislike films and stories where the leading character is despicable. Most writers and directors try to find the silver lining in them. Emphasize their positive side over their negative. Scott, Bryant, and Roeg don't achieve that with Baxter's. Not having this relatability prevents the viewer from immersing themselves wholly into the tale being told. Don't get me wrong; I've known people like Baxter's, and I have steered clear of them. Wish I'd done the same with this film.In some ways, I consider this film is trying to emulate a Gallo. In that respect, the production team should have handed the story to somebody who knows how to write and film a Gallo movie. Even the ridiculous ending would have been more credible in their hands. Don't Look Now is a case of the wrong director and bad writers.The cast, on the other hand, is superb. Their skills shine even when they're directed to do silly things; especially Hillary Mason who portrays the blind medium, Heather. She does a great job in portraying her affliction and gift. Regrettably, there's one scene where she goes into a trance, in which she kneads her breasts and cries out, ""Yes"". I'm surprised she's not in a trance more often!I do have to say, the most frightening thing about the whole movie is Julie Christie's fetish for armpits. In the sex scene, she really does get into Donald Sutherland's pits. Disturbing and funny.It was fortunate the writers were so terrible at creating characters because it allowed the actors and actresses free will over their portrayals. At intervals, it's hit and miss. As with Sutherland's John Baxter. This guy is stoic and standoffish. A man who would be content on his own. But then we have to believe he cared for his daughter enough to follow a mysterious figure through the alleyways of Venice. Then there's the whole; I don't believe in ghosts, but I'm seeing the spirit of my dead daughter, I must be mad, side to him. The writing and direction for these warring stances are poorly managed, but Sutherland does his best to deliver. He doesn't make it, but he comes close. But at the end of the day, John and Laura Baxter are unpleasant people.Don't Look Now, was an ambitious project for those involved and still fails to satisfy me.

77,gizmomogwai,Do look at Don't Look Now now,10,25 May 2011,"This movie made the British Film Institute's top 10 and it topped the best 100 films list of the British publication Time Out. According to Wikipedia Don't Look Now was, along with Hitchcock's great film Rebecca, one of only two movies Daphne du Maurier liked based on her work. But living in North America, I found it a hard movie to see and harder to buy. If you can get ahold of this one, it's worth it.After losing their young daughter, a depressed married couple (Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland) encounter two weird sisters who claim they can see the girl in spirit and that she is happy. This gives Laura (Christie) much relief, but John won't accept his daughter's afterlife. He thinks he's being realistic, but he's really in denial- Laura is making peace with the child's death and John isn't. His failure to do so makes him think he can still find her and chase after her- a mistake that destroys him, despite psychic warnings.What are we to make of that killer dwarf? The viewer is free to decide whether she was real or a metaphor, a deformed serial killer or death personified. Maybe John was killed by a murderer but he had delusions as to what the killer looked like. Maybe he actually killed himself. Maybe he died in the accident at the Church and what happens after that is all in his mind in his last few seconds. In that light, the dwarf, which might be regarded by some as strange and random, is open to interpretation.The story possibilities are helped along with beautiful direction, editing and cinematography. There does seem to be some influence from Hitchcock. Not all of the acting is perfect- Sutherland yelling out ""Dead! Dead! Dead!"" was overkill- but in general it works. The movie is intriguing, haunting, and captivating.",Don't Look Now
78,ODDBear,A true classic,9,20 September 2006,"A couple recovering from the death of their daughter reside in Venice where the husband is restoring an old church. The meet elderly sisters and one of them claims she can see the little girl from beyond. At the same time a vicious murderer is running loose on the streets.There's no real neat way of summarizing the storyline from Don't Look Now. It's such a multi layered and gripping thriller that keeps rewarding audiences on repeated viewings. Every aspect is so carefully and professionally handled; the stunning photography making the best possible use of Venice's enchanting scenery, the supernatural element that lurks over and the puzzles that keep making more and more sense the more you watch the film and think about it. Don't Look Now is truly a unique film.By setting the film in it's off season where no tourists are lurking about, Venice takes on quite a unique look as the streets are mostly empty and the town looks awfully creepy during nighttime. The film has some striking imagery and will stay with you long afterwords. The classic love scene is the most beautiful I've seen, carefully edited and actually making a point in the process. The clever script keeps viewers completely unaware of where the film is going to go next and the classic shock ending still gives many adults nightmares (actually cited in a number of textbooks as an early shock which still give people the ""willies"" if seen at an early age).Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie play extremely well off each other, a genuinely likable and believable couple; you really care about them. Roeg's direction is nothing short of superb, his best work by far.Very recommended.",Don't Look Now
79,sharky_55,Nothing is what it seems.,9,30 January 2016,"The opening sequence of Don't Look Now contains some of the greatest editing I have ever seen. Rewatching this with the knowledge of the ending and then comparing it to that 'life flashing before his eyes' montage in the last moments of John's life gives it a even stranger, hypnotic power. In Roeg's Walkabout, he would cross-cut freely between the Australian outback and the relatively urbanised city landscape to draw comparison. Here, he juxtaposes the mundane with the mundane until the tragedy creeps up upon the two unsuspecting parents; dropping a little plastic ball into the water as a glass is knocked over, and then frenzy with nonchalance; they both see the smear of red ink that spills across the photo print with an unmistakable meaning, but as John makes a frantic dive into the lake, we cut to Laura tossing it aside for a smoke. And then the ink slides even further and bathes the frame completely, and links itself to the sopping wet raincoat that will become a harrowing motif that follows John throughout the film. Clifford jumps ahead in time via the aural match cut of the scream and the drill, and depicts the couple seemingly recovering from the loss in Italy. In the most well known segment of the film, a controversial sex scene at the time, he intercuts the sensuality of the moment with the utterly uneventful post-coital movements. Roeg and co. make this doubly impressive, first in the raw physicality of Sutherland and Christie's lovemaking that is charged with a powerful shared emotion (mainly grief) and is much more explicit as opposed to the conventional sex scene. The contrast suggests that their relationship is just as strong in the sexual ecstasy as it is moments later, easily existing in the two opposing points. Secondly, in the way that Clifford does not merely alternate between the two time periods, but almost overlaps them by way of match cut; the hips bending and undressing and dressing simultaneously, bare backs being revealed and covered up at the same time. This further pushes the idea of non-chronological presentation that doesn't seem to bear any meaning until the very end. But as entwined as they are in the bedroom, they exhibit two very different reactions to the visions of a blind psychic they bump into in Venice. At first John is dismissive, and hesitant to give any thought to his late daughter. And then he begins to witness things himself, things that would otherwise be impossible. There is a scene where they talk on the phone that is so brilliant at visualising this seed of fear and doubt forming in his mind. John has convinced himself that Laura is in Venice, but is shocked to hear her voice from all the way over in England. She is photographed with this hazy, dreamlike quality and her words are the same; reassuring, pleasant, encouraging. The brilliance is in the dialogue that seems to almost drown out each other in their own insistence - Laura barely stops talking to let John ask a question, as if everything was all right and there was nothing to worry about. And John attempts to find an opening to relay his strange experiences, but ends up not even being able to set a date and time for them to meet later on. This conversation has them on completely different planes, but it is done with such subtlety in the dialogue, as if there was just a little bit of satellite interference, instead of their fast unravelling story. The sound is as vital in both its absence and appearances. Sometimes a soft piano will hover over a scene, under the guise of innocence and tranquility. At times this will replace the diegetic sound entirely, and make a moment like making love or discovering your dead child seem to last an eternity. When John first spots the sisters from high on the rooftop an ominous gong sounds, and the camera aligns itself with his own perspective, framing the pair beyond the unsuspecting Laura. Later, their laughs echo in the track like a devil's cackle. And when he spots his wife, who should be hundreds of miles away, the orchestration jumps into a high tempo, distressing rhythm. In the silence, Richmond pulls his weight by making the city of Venice a labyrinth that reverberates the growing paranoia - dim, unrevealing and claustrophobic, a nightmare to get lost in. As the climax nears, he adds swirls of fog which seems supernatural in nature, but to which John hurries past.He seeks the red raincoat. Roeg masterfully engineers this motif to seep into his everyday experience. The upside-down reflection of the pond mirrors a body being dragged up from the canals of Venice one morning. This shimmering reflection shot is later what first introduces the grotesque dwarf. The camera will follow John as he moves past pillars and obstacles and slivers of light, seeking and searching, turning dark corners that no character should logically turn. Red will unexpectedly flit quickly pass any normal person's eyeline, but the zoom betrays his increasing deluded obsession. It is such an innocent, childlike symbol too - but reality rarely allows for these items to remain untouched, and it is marred beyond comprehension, as a bewildered John realises all too late. The little red hat that Johnny wears to the funeral now carries a frightening connotation. This is an excellent film - it brushes aside conventional horror techniques and in doing so becomes fraught with terror.",Don't Look Now
80,aciessi,Made you look.,5,3 September 2020,"I've heard nothing but high praise for Don't Look Now. Some of the best film auteurs (horror and otherwise) in history talk up this movie and how it inspired them. I've been searching it out for years. I'm surprised by how disappointed I am. Don't Look Now is slow, boring and genuinely not scary. Does it have the template for an outstanding ghost story? Yes. It especially precursors some of the more modern horror masterpieces we know (Hereditary). But it's flaw is in its characters. Christine and John are unlikeable. They are unfriendly aristocrats, lavishly vacationing in Venice. This is a couple of whom an extreme tragedy has befallen upon them in the accidental death of their daughter. In sympathizing with them, we can in turn internalize the horror that is foisted upon them later. Because of who they are, we don't sympathize with them. Therefore, nothing that happens to them comes across as scary; at least to me.",Don't Look Now
81,Stampsfightclub,Entertaining and dramatic film,7,20 January 2010,"John Baxter (Sutherland) and his wife Laura (Christie) struggle to move on after their daughter's death and when in Venice they meet a blind psychic who sees the spirit of their daughter.Based on Daphne Du Maurier's fantastic novel, this British film aims high to depict the hard nature of a story transfixed with powerful and emotionally involved deaths the tough bond of marriage and all the while, Don't look Now will please neutrals if reader's of the book may feel a little hard done by.The opening montage is a brilliant selection of the type of film we viewers are gearing up. Two children playing apparently safely are left on their own by their parents who are mixed up in their own world. What follows is a striking shot in which Donald Sutherland's John sprints out of the house and we see a high angled shot looking down into the expressionless eyes of his daughter, floating in the water. This scene is staggering, made powerful through the sudden shock of aimless playing and a father trying his best to save her.Whilst the film begins with the grizzly opening the book opens with the married couple sat in the restaurant discussing the people around them.Changing tactic from calm to shocking allows us to be engrossed into proceedings and sets the upcoming drama. I confess to not loving this change, particularly after witnessing the too quick cut from Laura's view of John clutching their daughter. Nevertheless the rest of the film picks up the dramatic implication of the tragedy as the cut switches into the restaurant where the sisters are introduced.The beauty of a book is imagination and to adapt such a provocative story such as this makes our assumptions different. When reading the novel I found the psychic to be a bit more reserved, a little less forward. The scripting and seizures Hilary Mason goes through as Helen are a tad awkward, bit of a contradictory to the calm nature of the psychic in the novel.For a short story at around 50 pages its amazing to squeeze a two hour film out of. There are notes of improvisation where events happen on screen rather than in the book, such as the vivacious love scene, the wandering around the streets at night and the collapsing sequence in the church. All brilliant, if lacking a bit of author magic. There are many little things that add up to such a consistent feeling, such as the red themes and calm feel of Venice despite the hidden crime details.What was a slight disappointment was the lack of focus on the murder spree happening in Venice, a touch more detail and the ending would have felt more personal. The sound is terribly loud and warbled Nevertheless this is a shocking provocative adaptation that will entertain and delight many, especially for the neutral who will be in for many surprises.",Don't Look Now

The film stars Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie as a husband and wife whose lives grow complicated after meeting two elderly sisters in Venice, one of whom is clairvoyant and claims to be in contact with their recently deceased daughter who is trying to warn them of impending danger.The film is based on a short story by Daphne du Maurier. The macabre short story, in director Nicolas Roeg's hands, became a brilliant exploration of loss, grief, betrayal and eroticism. The celebrated sex scene between Sutherland and Christie sets the tone for a mystery of strange supernatural connections and unknowable truths, while Venice look like a place with brooding, shadowy secrets and dark, nightmarish alleys.

83,spookyrat1,Let Him Not Go!,9,30 March 2020,"People seem to either like or dislike Nicolas Roeg films. I am a member of the former party and I think Don't Look Now sees him at the peak of his creative powers, telling a story that is uniquely scary and dislocating, whilst not really using the traditional tools to do this.There is no gradual build-up of tension, no dark, stormy nights, no piercing, shrill musical soundtrack and no haunted houses. But from the first couple of minutes, where we see art restorer John Baxter (a memorable Donald Sutherland) examining slides of a planned Venetian project, whilst his daughter Christine plays outside near the property's pond, we are immersed in an eerie, compelling tale of death, the supernatural and the dangers encountered somewhere in between.Most of the action occurs in a stunningly photographed wintry Venice, where John and his wife Laura ( a very convincing Julie Christie) travel to work on an old church and recover from the traumatic loss of their daughter to drowning. Instead they find the famed low-lying coastal city, largely bereft of tourists, but filled with decaying monuments, religious works, lonely canals and whose local population is shocked by a series of murders seemingly perpetrated by a serial killer. Whilst a stoic John goes about his restoration work which we deduce quite early, is not always progressing smoothly, Laura meets a pair of strange old British sisters, one of whom is a blind psychic. She insists to Laura she can communicate with Christine, who at dramatic intervals seems to warn her of impending danger to John, who we already suspect may have some sort of ESP too.This is Roeg's cleverest fusion of artiness and skilful storytelling. A film- maker ahead of his time, his use of beautifully staged and edited cross and inter-cutting of flash backs and flash forwards is brilliantly effective at enhancing the palpable atmosphere of psychological disturbance, dread and irony. These processes are far more common these days, but it's useful to remember we're discussing a film nearly 50 years old and Roeg was undoubtedly a major influencer, in persuading other directors to experiment with this style of story-telling.Whilst no action film, Don't Look Now contains some indelible set pieces. These include the spectacular slow-motion aerial accident in the church, where Sutherland, doing the stunt, was apparently in real danger and John's nocturnal pursuit of a mysterious red-garbed figure who he now believes may be the ghost of his deceased child. This sequence culminates in the unforgettable and chilling finale to the film. There is also the beautifully and quite artistic lengthy, passionate sex scene between John and Laura that is again cleverly and pointedly intercut with impassive scenes of them dressing for dinner.Based on a short story by Daphne du Maurier, Don't Look Now showcases Roeg's characteristically non-linear style of storytelling in a logical, almost non-flashy manner. Watching it, it becomes abundantly clear why the film's reputation has grown in the years since its release and is now considered a classic of the horror genre and a very influential work.

84,rainking_es,A little bit confusing.,6,17 May 2008,"Roeg uses in the best way the city of Venice, its narrow streets and its shadows in ""Don't look now"". Also Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie (what a wonderful woman) make a hell of a job, especially Sutherland... So, what's the matter? Everything looks set up for a nice intrigue, but the plot (as far as I can see) is totally meaningless. You don't know if you've missed some clues or if there are not such clues to be missed at all. ""Don't look now"" begins like a a typical drama involving the death of a young girl and for the next 70 minutes it does not happen anything remarkable... until we get to the ending sequences, where Roeg supposedly clarifies everything... not for me, Mr. Roeg! *My rate: 5'5/10",Don't Look Now

'Oh make it weird, put a dwarf in it!'

My feelings about the movie were ambivalent. I liked it for the beautiful cinematography, for the eerie, disorienting, discomforting atmosphere, both aided by the timeless, dark beauty of Venice.I appreciated it for the symbolism, for the clever and subtle foreshadowing in almost every scene. But that's also what killed it for me - it felt like Roeg was trying too hard, and like I've seen it all before. As much as I appreciated it, I didn't truly enjoy it, I didn't truly felt the characters, their pain or their fear, and I didn't immerse myself in the film. And I can't quite figure out if the fault lies with the film or with myself - maybe I'm too jaded to truly let myself feel a film like this.

The setting of a winter Venice (what a backdrop!) gives this film a chilling air all of its own.Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie are perfectly cast as the middle class couple and the two old women that have something to tell them are great too.

Both pictures succeed in dislocating the viewer, and although the twist here is simpler than in the WM, it is no less effective.Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie play a couple slowly coming to terms with the accidental drowning of their daughter. The film is largely set in Venice; and imagery of dripping or running water is so central to the story it appears to be almost a character in the movie. Director Nicholas Roeg skillfully evokes an atmosphere of decay and death without once ever going over the top; this atmosphere hovers over the film, but only occasionally intrudes.Sutherland and Christie both give committed performances, and without going into the plot too much, find themselves confronting the death of their daughter in different ways. Old Venice comes to life with real feeling, and a splendid sequence in a church with Sutherland hanging on for his life due to an accident is tremendously gripping.The movie is probably a little slow for modern audiences not used to this kind of film where ambiance is even more important then the story, but those who can stay with it are in for a gem of a film.

90,Eumenides_0,"A Beautiful, Thoughtful, Unpredictable Horror Movie",9,26 April 2009,"Nicola Roeg's Don't Look Now is one of the most interesting and technically well-made horror movies I've ever seen. Drawing inspiration from Daphne du Maurier's short-story (adapted by Allan Scott and Chris Bryant), this is a story about loss, grief, fate, madness, set in a Venice which is simultaneous beautiful and nightmarish.John and Laura Baxter travel to Venice where he's engaged in restoring an old church. They also use this travel to try and forget the death of their daughter Christine and possibly salvage a wrecked marriage. But a chance encounter with two British ladies changes everything; one of them, blind and claiming to have psychic powers, tells Laura she's seen Christine and that she's happy. John is skeptical, but the mourning Laura is sucked right into her visions. She also has a warning for John: he must leave Venice or he'll die.But John is developing his own madness, as he starts seeing a figure which resembles Christine. Ironically, as Laura starts getting some comfort from the old lady, John becomes himself obsessed. And his obsession will lead him to an unforgettable meeting with fate and to one of the most unexpected endings in film history.Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie are amazing in their respective roles, he as a commonsensical man who's trying to leave the past behind, she as a mother trying to cope with loss. Their relationship is honest and convincing: I really believe they've been a lifetime together and have gone through the death of a child.There's a famous sex scene in this movie, very visual, which some call needless; but for me it summons up their relationship through the movie: they're too lonely people who've drifted apart and are trying to reconnect. It's a beautiful moment of passion and intimacy.The technical aspects of the movie are just as excellent. I particularly admire Anthony B. Richmond's cinematography, which turned beautiful Venice into a frightening city full of shadows and unknown horrors at each turn. Pino Donnagio's score is also beautiful: it's sad, serene and restrained, much like the movie itself. The editing is also clever: Roeg and Graeme Clifford constantly insert bits from John's past into the narrative, showing how past and present are always together.Unfortunately the story is never strong: as much as I love the movie, at times it felt incoherent, with a serial killer plot that needed more room for development, especially considering it ties up everything together. I can't wait to read du Maurier's story to see how she dealt with this.All in all, Don't Look Now is a fascinating horror movie, made during horror's last Golden Age (it came out in the same year The Exorcist and The Wicker Man did); it's intelligent, it's mature and it's emotionally engaging. Quite simply, no one makes them like these anymore.",Don't Look Now
91,Ali_John_Catterall,Red Cross Code: A DVD Commentary,10,13 November 2009,"Optimum Home Entertainment, 2006 Contents:Introduction with Alan Jones Audio commentary with Nicolas Roeg and Adam Smith 'Looking Back' featurette An interview with Pino Donaggio TrailerNo, you're not suffering from some Roeg-ish déjà vu: Don't Look Now was originally released on DVD by Warner Bros in 2002. However, that version only featured the trailer and the 'Looking Back' featurette, along with a notoriously poor stereo track. This special edition aims to consign that version to the dustbin (or its modern equivalent, eBay), sporting Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo sound, a digitally restored anamorphic widescreen transfer, terrific new cover artwork - and, best of all, an audio commentary with the elusive director Nic Roeg himself. But more of him later. ""They say seeing is believing"" intones the wordy trailer. ""But only a split second of time separates the past from the future. The present is crushed between them. A thin thread of life in a skein of death."" If that's not creepy enough, the guy doing the voice-over sounds like he's on loan from a 1970s public information film, the sort aimed at children who like playing near canals. ""Don't. Look. Now."" It's like the anti-Green Cross Code. Introducing the movie is horror expert Alan Jones (yes, he does rather look like Pluto from Wes Craven's The Hills Have Eyes), who notes the film ensured ""that parents would never again buy their child a red plastic raincoat"". He also reminds us that the frankest sex scene in mainstream cinema history up to that point was the first to be filmed, and that composer Pino Donaggio, whose first feature this was, went on to score Brian De Palma's Carrie, Dressed To Kill, and Body Double. As a 1960s pop idol, he also had a hit with the original version of 'You Don't Have To Say You Love Me', then called 'Io Che Non Vivo', before Simon Napier Bell and Vicki Wickham re-jigged it for Dusty Springfield. The 20-minute featurette 'Looking Back' (note: contains major spoilage) sees Roeg, cinematographer Anthony Richmond and editor Graeme Clifford reminiscing about the movie. For Roeg, Don't Look Now was ""an exercise in film grammar... these images were part of a puzzle that we'd eventually come to understand."" The crew describe shooting in Venice - ""the winters are grim,"" with Roeg recalling the City's ""curious sound maze"", by which tourists traversing its gloomy alleyways will never be sure whether the sound of footsteps are behind or in front of them. The film's palate was vitally important, with the colour red used very sparingly, to maximise its chilling impact. The celebrated love scene wasn't originally in the script, and was shot in 90-minutes in a hotel room on a hand-held. ""It's not a seduction,"" stresses Roeg of the couple's healing intercourse. ""It's a married couple at it,"" adds Richmond. Finally, Roeg explains the significance of Julie Christie's final beatific smile aboard the funeral barge - ""a smile of the undefeated in the face of defeat is somehow much more powerful."" Elsewhere, composer Donaggio states he can't remember much about the film (good start), but then proceeds to recall quite a bit. Apparently, the producers didn't want him, but Roeg was ""excited"" with his efforts and gave him free reign; De Palma didn't share Roeg's hands-off approach, it seems. Donaggio of course, is also responsible for the love scene music, which, with its hippie flutes, sounds like the incidental score for a 1970s children's cartoon from Czechoslovakia. And there's very little that's sexy about that. You may want to crank the volume up a bit for the audio commentary; at 78, Roeg may still have all his faculties intact but vocal projection isn't one of them (Rowley Birkin QC from 'The Fast Show' springs to mind). You really have to concentrate here. It's a moot point whether this is as definitive an insight into the film as we're going to get (Roeg, like his non-linear output, is too digressive for that, and rarely answers a question directly) but it's marvellous to have him nonetheless. Among other things, the director recalls that Daphne Du Maurier, who wrote the original short story on which Don't Look Now is based, wrote to Roeg after seeing the film to tell him that his two leads, Christie and Sutherland, reminded her so much of the couple she saw in Torcello, having lunch together - the couple who had influenced her story: ""They looked so handsome and beautiful and yet they seemed to have a terrible problem and I watched them with sadness... It struck me perhaps that their child had died."" Roeg describes the difficulties of shooting in Venice - ""the most bizarre and wonderful place"" - and the casting. (""I liked the idea of an English and American marriage... a sort of common language but completely different culture""). Of the sex scene, he says, ""It's a completely natural thing. I think that's why people can put themselves in that position... if you know what I mean!"" Roeg recalls that the film wasn't universally praised when it first came out, which the director generously puts down to its distribution (it was originally released on a double bill with an equally overlooked movie, The Wicker Man). Of the film's ambiguous themes (and for Roeg, theme rather than plot is everything), he says ""I think any drama has to have the quality of something unfinished. Our whole existence is predicated by the fact we don't have anything complete. If we do feel that, we're missing something."" Enigmatic to the end, he also won't be pressed on whether the film still stands up for him. ""It's a memory for me,"" he states. Ah, but what memories.",Don't Look Now
92,diane-34,I wish Holleywood would make films like this now,10,17 April 2014,"Diane and I watched this wonderful film when it was first released in '73 after returning from trips to Venice. Therefore, we could easily relate to the dark night shots in back alleys with the only movement being cats seemingly searching for prey in dark places. I mention this because this will be one of the few films that you can watch that does not show the glamorous side of Venice: the main piazza, the Cathedral and the fancy restaurants. No, in keeping with the ""darkness"" of the movie the director has maintained this feeling throughout the film: no sunshine, a funeral scene rather than a wedding and flights of pigeons flying noisily flying off unexpectedly. If you put all of these things together, as the director has, you create excellent canvas upon which to paint the movie that you are filming.Diane and I had no problem with any parts of the film; we enjoyed it as much last evening as we had 41 years ago.

This is directed by Nick Roeg and as is usual in his films a lot of red is used in his scenes. Red in the clothing or rug or set pieces. The film is beautifully shot in a Venice that many people have probably never seen or never will see. Sections of Venice alleys that are damp, dark and lonely and very quiet. But what was that quick red flash? A child? A midget? Who knows? The acting is excellent by everyone and the film is beautifully paced. There are very intimate scenes between the husband and wife that are revealing without being graphic or sleazy. The film has some very unusual creepy moments and overall is mesmerizing. You can't take your eyes off of it. A lot of films have tried to be this sophisticated and failed. This one will probably stay in your collection.",Don't Look Now
94,avik-basu1889,A psychological and symbolic study of grief and how to get over it !!!,9,26 October 2015,"'Don't Look Now' is a psychological thriller/horror film directed by Nicolas Roeg. The screenplay written by Allan Scott and Chris Bryant is adapted from a short story of the same name written by Daphne du Maurier. Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland respectively play Laura and John Baxter, a couple struggling to get over the grief of losing their daughter Christine when she accidentally drowned to death. They move to Venice when John gets commissioned to restore a church. There they come across two sisters, one of them being blind. The blind sister who claims to be psychic tells Laura that she can see Christine and is in touch with her, their dead daughter.'Don't Look Now' is one of those films that will divide audiences all around the world. Some will absolutely love it, while some will hate it big time. This is because Nicolas Roeg's style is very unconventional and on the first viewing can be a bit unsettling. Although I haven't read the original short story that this film is based on, but I can easily say that the film is an artistic work with an identity of its own. It is very visual. In the film's very first sequence, Roeg pretty much summarises what the film will explore. There are infinite jump-cuts, numerous flashbacks and flash-forwards and other various visual tricks which Roeg uses to make the film extremely rich visually. The colour red is of paramount importance. This film has a creepy cold European vibe borne out of isolation which reminded me of Polanski's 'The Tenant'. There are certain shots in the film which will stay with me always due to their disturbing and unsettling nature like the shot where the blind psychic sister Heather gets introduced to the audience for the first time and we see her reflection on the three mirrors all next to each other or the famous shot of the red hooded figure turning back to reveal her face to John.One of the most important elements of the film is the way in which Roeg shoots Venice. This is a city which is renowned for its simplistic beauty and romantic aura. But quite to the contrary, Roeg makes Venice look desolate, scary and worn out. The narrow lanes are confusing and Jack and Laura constantly lose their way. This is essential to the theme, because I believe the desolate weary Venice represents the state of John and Laura's minds. They just can't get over the grief of losing their daughter. Their minds have become as weary, dark and lifeless as the Venice that they are residing in. But Laura comes into contact with the two sisters and she decides to believe the supposedly psychic blind sister when she says Christine is happy and well. Laura decides to show faith and as a result receives at least some mental satisfaction. But the rational John refuses to give in to the claims of the psychic and refuses to recognise that he himself might be psychic. As a result he goes on wallowing in misery and guilt, as he clearly still blamed himself for Christine's death. This refusal to show faith in the end leads to his sad death. I truly believe 'Don't Look Now' can be seen as a companion piece to 'The Exorcist' as both are films that explore faith. I think both films show that irrespective of whether you believe in God and the afterlife or not, having faith can actually give you closure and give you mental strength to move on from some form of grief and start living again. John refused to believe the psychic sister. So while Laura received some sort of closure, John continued to suffer with guilt all on his own. The red hooded figure who turns out to be the murderer represents the grief mixed with guilt that John just can't get rid of no matter where he goes and in the end this grief gets the better of him and kills him.Another important aspect of the film is the gender divide. The women are far more open to the possibility of the supernatural and the godly, while the men are consumed by their rational thoughts. The bishop of the church that John is supposed to restore is seen in the film to question God's plans and God's priorities. John doesn't pay any heed to his wife's requests to be open to the claims of the sisters. Apart from Nicolas Roeg's creative and inventive style of storytelling, one has to admire the acting. Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie are brilliant. They actually looked like a couple. You can see that they love each other, but you can also grasp the sadness and the distance that has grown between them after the great loss. This duality in their relationship gets underlined by Roeg through brilliant editing in the infamous sex scene which gets inter-cut with shots of both of them getting dressed afterwards on their own without any chitchat. We witness the passion in the sex, but at the same time we witness how both are somewhat distant and how both are still overwhelmed by Christine's memories. Hilary Mason also has to be admired for her disturbing and creepy portrayal of the blind psychic Heather.'Don't Look Now' is a brilliantly crafted psychological horror film. I think like 'The Exorcist', the main theme running through it is faith. Nicolas Roeg does a great job in making a film that is genuinely disturbing as well as endearing as the director clearly loves the two main characters who are clearly troubled and Roeg has respect for both of them.",Don't Look Now

97,coldwaterpdh,You will suffer two hours of no plot for one halfway-decent final scene.,3,1 January 2009,"Where do I start? After reading some reviews on here, I was excited to see this flick. Some great things have been said on here for sure. After completing ""Don't Look Now,"" one can only assume these things were written by four year olds. Unless you find mindless dialog, pointless scenes and under-developed characters entertaining, you will not be impressed by this slice of mediocre 70's crap.I actually laughed at the ending, which, to those of us who have seen far superior films like ""Profondo Rosso,"" ""Don't Torture a Duckling"" and ""The House With Laughing Windows"" will seem like an episode of ""Full House."" So a dwarf hacks Donald Sutherland once in the neck and he dies. Frankly, he probably deserved it for subjecting the viewers to his flaccid, pale, awkward body in a prolonged, painful sex scene with co-star Julie Christie. Easily the scariest part of the film right there.I was bothered by the 'plot' in ""Don't Look Now,"" and I use the term plot very loosely because there just isn't much of one. I'll sum it up for you: Donald Sutherland and wife lose child in drowning accident. They go to Venice so Sutherland can restore a church. Some boring stuff happens for almost two hours then the Sutherland gets hacked one time by a dwarf in a red coat that looks similar to the one his daughter was wearing. In the end, my reaction was WHO CARES? I wanna know about that ugly little dwarf, dammit! That would have made for a much better flick than what I just sat through! Don't bother watching this if you haven't seen the 1970's Italian horror films of Argento, Fulci, Sergio Martino and Aldo Lado first. This one attempts to rob from those films but does so very poorly. To those of us who are seasoned giallo vets, this will prove to be a maddening, over-hyped, jumbled mess that cannot hold a candle to the real thing.Scary?

98,GeorgeRoots,"Part Of Me Thinks The Movie Has Aged, Yet It's Gorgeous Cinematography Is Anything But.",8,13 October 2014,"If there's anything you'll take away from your first viewing of ""Don't Look Now"" it's the swirling waters, colours of red and similar motifs repeated throughout the movie. After an ""apparently"" explicit sex scene for its time that is only a minute long, and if by then you've even bothered to actually make a big deal about it shame on you. ""Don't Look Now"" appears to be pretty thin on the outside, but on repeated viewings it turns out to actually be full of details that paint a much larger picture.Laura Baxter (Julie Christie) and John (Donald Sutherland) are a married couple, who after the recent accidental death of their daughter travel to Venice when the husband accepts a commission to restore a church. They encounter two sisters where one claims to be clairvoyant, and informs them that their daughter is trying to contact them and warn them of impending danger. The husband at first dismisses their claims, but starts to experience mysterious sightings himself.A little more heavy handed than your average thriller. The subtle amounts of grief begin to separate the couple, and there's some exceptional editing when it comes to the scenes of premonitions and the overall cinematography of Venice is beautiful. You can look up all the themes of the movie, because ""Don't Look Now"" possibly has the most ever bundled into one film and sadly not all of them are as easy to decipher. I cannot help but personally feel that there is a huge pacing issue, or disconnect I always feel towards every character regardless of scenario. I know that's one of the themes and whether or not that was intentional I can't say, but it really hinders the movie for me every time I watch it.Final Verdict: When all is said and done, I think ""Don't Look Now"" comes off as more of a drama than an actual thriller. Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie do wonderful work, and everything else is a tale of recurring events and sharp U-turns. Maybe I need to see it again, but I would certainly say this movie demands patience and you better have it. 7.5/10.",Don't Look Now

Great to look at but jeez, boring as heck. Don't Look Now paints a picture of Venice that is beautiful yet bleak, and its cinematographer, Anthony B. Richmond, won a BAFTA for it, though I wonder if the impact of the movie doesn't come more from director Nicholas Roeg and film editor Graeme Clifford instead.Wow, the editing is relentless and blatant. Imagery was shoved in my face so hard that even the persistently shallow moviegoer that I am managed to draw parallels between images and story. I think that's why this movie is so acclaimed: it's a master class in film editing, though it's probably better appreciated from a filmmaker or film critic's eye than an Average Joe's, much like Citizen Kane.Or maybe the boys like this movie because of the almost X-rated sex scene between Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie.

Nowadays, this 1974 adaptation of a Daphne Du Maurier ghost story looks almost classical. Following the drowning of their child in England, Laura (Christie) and John Baxter (Donald Sutherland) have come to dank, eternally dying Venice, where he is supervising the restoration of a moldering church and she is either slipping into or climbing out of madness with the help of a pair of creepy spinster sisters, one of whom can ""see"" even though blind. John may share this psychic power, though he resists accepting it as the canals fill with murder victims, surface realities turn shimmery as water, and a red-coated figure--the daughter's ghost?--keeps flickering in the corner of our vision.

104,Aly200,"Rich in color, good acting, haunting and beautifully shot",8,10 February 2017,"Nicolas Roeg, a cinematographer turned director, decided that his first feature film would be based on a short story by author Daphne De-Maurier who had penned 'Rebecca'. The novice director decided to take on her story of a couple who travel to Italy, for the husband's job as an architect, following the accidental death of their young daughter.Portraying the couple, John and Laura Baxter, are the respected Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie who play off each other perfectly. Both leads handle the film's central theme of grief in dramatically different ways; Laura seeks answers to how her beloved child is faring after death while husband John wishes to let things lie and constantly reminds himself and even more profoundly, Laura, that their daughter, Christine, is dead. Secretly, we are privy to the knowledge that John quietly mourns for Christine, but doesn't open himself up to Laura or anyone else around him. The chemistry between Sutherland and Christie is electric, coming off as an actual married couple; though they spend much of the film arguing, but there are tender moments which remind us that John and Laura love each other deeply despite their loss. Director Roeg is a visual wizard behind the camera as he shoots the vast landscape of the city of Venice as well as the film's opening locale of the English countryside. At the Baxter home, we see wide fields and the ominous pond that takes sweet innocent Christine from her family representing a one-time carefree and happy place. When we get to Venice with John and Laura after the harrowing opening scene, we are led into a more Gothic yet architecturally rich city-scape. John works to restore a beautiful historical church which lends to the rich Gothic undertones of the film. The daylight scenes in the city are shot in mostly sunny-cloudy skies while the night scenes are haunting and eerie with looming archways, shadows that almost seem real, few people except for the principal players in the scene.The film's color palette is awash in seas of red which ultimately has a gruesome significance by the final scene of the narrative. Director Nicolas Roeg chooses only certain scenes for the color red to play a crucial part such as the opening scene with the Baxter children playing at home; Christine, the daughter, wears a bright red raincoat that becomes a metaphor in the film that later signals the penultimate fate of Donald Sutherland's John. The color reappears in a spill on a mosaic slide during both the film's opening and penultimate scenes and of course makes it bloody appearance at the end.The musical score is simplistic and used sparingly throughout. The tones range from boldly bombastic such the film's closing shot, mellow and haunting for dramatic moments and to a catchy flute- driven melody for the film's controversial love scene.

107,HenryHextonEsq,"A very crafty, disturbing, formidable film.",9,22 May 2002,"I think the commentator below is being remarkably unfair to this film, considering he/she readily admits they ""turned off 3/4 of the way through"". For to view ""Don't Look Now"" without the context of its shattering, stunning ending is to stop listening to the Beach Boys' ""Pet Sounds"" before ""I Just Wasn't Made For These Times"" and ""Caroline, No"". To bluntly try and explain what sort of film this is, well... let me say that those who have seen ""The Wicker Man"", ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" or ""Performance"" will notice, despite the vast differences in social and actual settings, that these four films have in common a mastery of accumulating tension and atmosphere. ""Performance"" is indeed partly made by Nic Roeg, the visual genius, some say charlatan (but not me) who directs ""Don't Look Now"". ""Performance"" is more consistently visceral in its impact, and the contrast of the two halves is remarkable, but that's another story. ""Don't Look Now"" is in many ways a less abstract and visually bombarding picture than ""Performance"", but that's not to say there aren't oblique visual images at many turns. The spectre of Pinter, that interestingly hangs over both halves of ""Performance"", is evident here to some extent. Note the tension of dialogue and body language in the cafe scene here, and also later in the film when Sutherland's John Baxter consults Bruno Cattaneo's odd, inscrutable Detective Sabbione. It is indeed a fine script, brought up to a remarkable level of subtlety by the vivid, artistic direction.I must say the acting is inch perfect here for the film. Donald Sutherland just looks so right for the part, and lets the audience get a very good sense of his emotions. Julie Christie gives an autumnal, particularly nuanced performance that belies those who question her worth as an actress. Perhaps out of the decade where she was an ""icon"", she was able to give more divergent performances. She was fine in ""Billy Liar!"" with the role that perhaps established her vivacious, metropolitan ""type"", and while I've heard some of her roles aren't great in other 60s films, ""Petulia"" sounds most interesting. Anyway, Christie is Laura Baxter here, a mature married woman, seemingly calm on the surface but inwardly shattered. It is a great tragic role, and she plays on the resignation as much as the logical madness of the character. Plus, of course, she's absolutely beautiful, and not as that Dane Hamlet oddly once said of Ophelia, ""beautified"" - her beauty comes across as intensely natural. The two sisters are especially sinister creations, visually unsettling and an odd mix of ""good old British cup of tea"" reassurance and something far more ominous and undisclosed.The ending, with the tangible symbolic link to earlier events, is a truly shattering moment, and I must not spoil it in any way. Suffice to say, Roeg makes it synthesize superbly. His direction is a deliberate mixture of abrupt, near subliminal editing and montage, with more ""slow"", stationary ominous shots - for example the scenes centering on the boats. Venice, is as many have said, a character in itself in the film, its beauty inflected by an autumnal decay and deathly stasis. The sex scene between Sutherland and Christie is pure beauty, excellent music and editing; it brilliantly represents what is a loving relationship, and becomes all the more melancholy in contrast to the film's dark events and hints at events. Pino Donaggio's music is fitting overall, really, if not as astounding as the cinematography and direction - perhaps something a little more jarring than the Italianate strings would have proved more apposite, though the music itself is good and fairly fitting.I would have to remark that many may not take to this film; it is far from an ""easy"" film to stomach, but making the effort, you can get an extraordinary amount out of it. Certainly a uniquely unsettling, very adult film, imbued with subtle brilliance; likely to stay with you for a long while...Rating:- **** 1/2/*****",Don't Look Now

The magic is in the presentation and the magician is Nicholas Roeg - cameraman of films like Dr.Zhivago and Lawrence of Arabia. Don't Look Now is one of his earliest films as director and is probably his best, narrowing beating his previous Walkabout set in Australia.The setting of Don't Look Now is off-peak Venice. The Venice generally known to film buffs is the warm, tourist friendly, summer vacation hot-spot featured in films like Lean's Summer Madness or a recent film Bread and Tulips. In Roeg's film, we see a less romanticized Venice sans tourist hordes. It is cold and quite often wet because its winter. The via's and waterways are virtually deserted as is the hotel John Baxter lives in.John Baxter, played brilliantly by Donald Sutherland is an expert at restoration and off-peak is the best time to restore a beautiful Chiesa in decay. He has come with his wife - Julie Christie of Zhivago - and both are mourning the death of their daughter from drowning. Much of the film deals with this loss and its aftermath. There is a lot of symbolism in the film and particular motifs like rain/water to remind us of the drowning and the color red, the color of the raincoat worn by the Baxter's daughter. There are two strange old ladies, one a blind-psychic, who befriend Mrs. Baxter and claim to have seen their daughter. The solitary ""sex"" scene is uniquely filmed and presented very artistically - and realistically.Don't Look Now is all about atmosphere and beautiful presentation. A real treat! It won't seem like a horror initially. I won't say more because that would constitute a spoiler.",Don't Look Now
111,Johan_Wondering_on_Waves,Artistic even symbolic but way too little story,4,22 March 2015,"I watched this movie as it really had a very interesting premise. The beginning scene where the little girl drowns is one of the most gripping I have seen. Everything that happens after that is way less interesting. Sure Venice offers a nice scenery and beautiful images, the narrow streets create an atmosphere of claustrophobia. The couple meet up with two old ladies, sisters, one is blind but has paranormal gifts telling them she can get in touch with their deceased daughter. Instead of showing the viewer how this could be done we as viewer just get the message that their daughter said they have to leave Venice as the father's life is in danger. Of course he doesn't believe even though he sees images of a girl with the same red jacket as the one his daughter was wearing when she drowned. And apparently there is also a murderer on the loose. I wish the director worked out this story aspect a bit better, tell me some more about the daughter how does she try to get in touch with her parents and the role of the older ladies it stayed all too vague. It seems to have no real goal, more artistic and perhaps symbolic rather than an interesting or gripping story. No I didn't feel for the father in the end as he was supposed to have the gift too but at no point in the movie he truly convinced me he was missing his daughter or trying to get over her loss.",Don't Look Now
112,Artimidor,Brilliant horror from left field,10,25 December 2011,"With ""Don't Look Now"", the filmed version of Daphne Du Maurier's short story, Nicolas Roeg delivers a horror movie of the very different kind. It's also one of the very best, even though or maybe exactly because Roeg stirred quite a controversy with his approach to tell the tale. What you get for sure is not the typical horror genre piece. Roeg weaves in supernatural elements, psychological drama, a crime/detective story, a famous love making scene and above all lots of realism and mood he draws directly from shooting on location. In all that a masterful play with expectations of characters as well as the viewers takes place, letting essential and unrelated random elements of the story stand side by side, adding more and more to the escalating confusion. Strange premonitions, painful memories, eerie visions and a multitude of sub-plots - all are packed into an actually highly cross-referencing movie with dominant psychological overtones. With all those threads going on at the same time the viewer is likely to get lost, just like John Baxter (Donald Sutherland), the film's protagonist. Notable assets are also a carefully plotted colors scheme, intelligent cinematography and groundbreaking scenes that show what exemplary editing and cutting can do to elevate a film way above its competitors.""Don't Look Now"" leads up to one of the most shocking climaxes in horror film history and will catch you most likely coming from left field. And if it does, the director has done his job. At any rate, the dark haunting alleys and mysterious canals of Venice are the perfect environment for a bone-chilling tale which keeps its suspense ominously simmering until the inevitable happens. Recommendable for those who like their mysteries slow, enjoy to (re-)discover how the mind works and still know why horror films of the olden days are the better choice.",Don't Look Now

116,thedarkhorizon,A painfully beautiful MOMENTO MORI: Celebration and fear of death - Gustav Mahler could not have done it better.,8,22 March 2020,"The film, other than a solid cult status, remains virtually unknown by the public at large. I just found out about this film due to a recommendation. This film is super atmospherical, eerie, intense and metaphysical.
The film overall deals with death, accepting death and transcending onto the 'other side'. It plays with topics like perception, faith, the ability to 'see' beyond the visible. A wild mix of fast and slow paced sequences, metaphysical imagery, sublime acting and deep dialogue lead you into the labyrinth of ghosts, fate and the essential questions about life (and death).The analog film allows for an intense color-play. The little daughter, that drowns at the beginning of the movie wears a bleeding red coat - and that red is accented throughout the film, popping up metaphysically everywhere. It becomes the symbol of luring death, hiding everywhere. The film takes us along the lost parents going to Venice, him and her, both equally dealing with it but doing it very differently. They engage with two old women, one is blind, but 'sees': she sees the child, she foresees accidents - she sees more than we do.
The film is about the visible and the unvisible, the hidden things and the tragic reality... and all the conflicts these things create.Here are some details that, observed closely, show the depth and love for details in this narrative:Intense images like the little girl running alongside the lake, but the frame showing mostly her reflection in the water: reversed gravity and her already being on the other 'side' (in the water).Her father looking at old photos while she dies, observing a passerby in a red coat on the photo - and then something red drips onto the photo and rips it apart.Everyday situations become deeply meaningful: super slow paced we observe her preparing a bath in the hotel room while he is working on his sketches outside and they try to communicate but no one understand the other: they are separated not just by location but by worldviews, which becomes painfully obvious there.Father walks by a lost doll in the river, shortly after the old blind women foresees death; a link to the daughters death and his own fate.Seemingly irrelevant sentences that are set in controversial situations to make the viewer think:""Seeing is believing"" says the father to the mother while she is in a hospital in venice after a tiny blackout caused by the old women and emotional overload.
""The church is the home of god, but he seems not to be interested."" (says the priest to the father while walking, criticizing catholic organizations which are not engaging with real human needs)
""I found the real world behind this bridge"" shouts the father where he sees a red coat rushing by (like his daughter)
""Our painters have the talent to give the living the appearance of the dead"" says the father to the priest while looking through sketches for the restoration of a church.Also the film is set in a sometimes non-chronological order. The story goes on, but often it is not clear what (or why) it happens; seemingly normal situations serve as symbols to foresee events or linking back to past events. Links and knowledge (like the blind woman for-seeing things she could not know) melt into each other and become universal. Universal fate like life and death are ever-present.The film has mostly slow, atmospheric and nearly TOO long sequences but breaks them up with exciting, fast paced and eventful moments like the death of the child or a wild chase through Venice, with bursting emotive music, blood, ringing bells, unusual angles.The film is created with great photography, exquisite acting and a great set(ting). Personally, I am reminded of the great heavy, detail loaded and heavy burdened symphonies by GUSTAV MAHLER, very metaphysical, atmospherical and questioning/battling the struggles of fate, death and life. I really enjoyed this hidden gem.This film might not be for everyone, but if you are in a very philosophical, melancholic mood, craving for a mysterious Venice, some ghost-seeing, thriller and darkness, you are served well.Pro tip: it needs to be watched more than one time to get ALL the beautiful details.",Don't Look Now

Felt like it didn't know what kind of film it wanted to be.Acting and cinematography were topnotch!I wanted to like it, but the ending ruined it for me. What was that!? All that build up for such a little payoff. It's a shame.Some people make comparisons between this and ""Who saw her die."" I don't see it.

118,spacemonkey_fg,Slow Burner...with a great ending!,10,18 January 2006,"Title: Don't Look Now (1973) Director: Nicolas Roeg (The Witches) Cast: Donald Sutherland, Julie Christie Review: Horror movies from the seventies. Gotta love them. Most of them had this ability to take their themes very seriously. As a result, the 70s spawned a lot of horror films that were made by some very gifted and respected directors. The Shinning, Rosemarys Baby, The Omen, The Changelingall serious and great horror films in my book. I will be adding Nicolas Roeg's Don't Look Now to my ""serious horror films of the 70s"" list.This is the story of a man John Baxter and his wife Laura who loose their daughter in an unexpected drowning accident. After coping with his daughter's death, he and his wife move to Venice Italy to work on the restoration of an abandoned church. While there they happen upon a blind woman who tells them that she can see their dead daughter and that she is ""happy"" where she is. This creates great curiosity on Laura and John, but while John dismisses it as a lot of hoopla, Laura takes it seriously and decides to see the blind old lady one more time. Things get a little more complicated with a serial killer running loose in the streets of Venice killing people left and right.This movie certainly qualifies to be called a ""slow burner"". It really takes its time to tell its story and is in no rush to get you excited. This is the type of movie that will take its own time to tell its tale and will hope that you the viewer will be patient and stay all the way to the end where you will be compensated with a very very good pay off. I have to admit though that I simply love slow burners like this one. They get underneath your skin better and this movie does that very effectively. Right to the bonechilling climax.First off, I really think that Venice was a perfect location for shooting this film. The dark and wet streets of Venice serve as an excellent backdrop to this spooky tale. The cinematography in this film is fantastic, taking full advantage of the beauty of Venice's streets and ancient architecture.Second, I loved how Roeg created this foreboding feeling all through out the film. Everything looks evil somehow, you always feel like the people of the town are in on something. As if its all part of some trick and in this I found the movie to be very similar to The Wicker Man. A strange land filled with strange people with different customs and culture all added to the feeling of alienation.The movie has solid performances. Donald Sutherland does a great job of being the unbeliever. His feet are firmly planted on reality despite all the things he keeps experiencing. I loved his character in the movie and it reminded me of a time when serious adult actors were used in films. It seems like nowadays every horror film has to have a hip young cast. And in real life, not everyone is 20 something. Sutherland's John Baxter felt slightly more realistic in that sense.My only gripe with the film is this incredibly lengthy sex scene that seemed very unnecessary in the film. John and Laura really go at each other in what has to be the longest sex scene ever filmed. Was it to show how they were comforting each other after the death of their daughter? Was it to show that they truly love each other in spite of all their arguing throughout most of the film? I don't know, but if seemed kind of excessive. Still, it was a beautifully shot sequence, as is most of the film by the way.Also, I was expecting the films supernatural vibe to be more prominent through out the film. I thought it was going to be more of a horror film then it turned out to be. As it is, there is a supernatural element in the film but I would say that this film is more of a drama sprinkled with a few elements of horror and suspense. Still, you get enough suspense and foreboding to satisfy any horror/suspense fan. Just thought Id say that in case any horror fans are expecting a full on horror movie. This movie is creepy, yes, but if focuses more on its performances and its drama. Nicolas Roeg, the director did manage to create this really creepy aura through out the film in which you feel something bad is always going to happen, I thought that was quite effective. There's a hallucinatory dream-like vibe to all of Johns visions that adds to the surreal feel of the film.So in conclusion, you got yourself a slow burner 70's psychological thriller, with a spooky setting, great performances and a stylish direction from director Nicolas Roeg. If you don't need gun shootings, explosions and special effects every five seconds in your films and feel the need to see a good psychological film that will play with your mind, get underneath your skin and shock you in the endwell, look no further.Rating: 5 out of 5",Don't Look Now
119,lhhung_himself,Too different for today's horror fan?,8,26 August 2007,"Reading the comments here, I get the distinct feeling that the wrong people are viewing this movie. So first off - don't rent this if you are expecting a slasher B flick. Don't rent this if you want a linear plot line with every event explained. Don't rent this because of a hot sex scene. Don't rent this if you expect Spielberg character development. You will be disappointed, bored, mystified and annoyed - this is not for you.If you are used to and like a slower Euro-style movie where things just happen because they are a part of the web of life and the plot being a subset of the whole then this is for you. If you like twists that actually make sense at the end rather than being tacked on just to be ""clever"" then this is for you. If you want to see an example where sex is used just like any other device to develop the relationship between the characters (as it does beautifully) then this is for you. If you like subtle characters, characters that feel real and with more dimension than needed (after all,the people you meet on the street aren't just there to advance your life story) then this is for you.I only wish that they would make more movies like this - for me.",Don't Look Now
120,youthandyoungmanhood,I think I liked it,7,27 July 2018,This film is one of the weirdest films I have seen In a long time. It had me gripped until the end and I'm still not sure entirely what happened at the end. Some creepy bits in this film which I will not spoil for you. Two good acting performances from the leads.

The opening sequence was particularly engaging, with the quick cuts and general eeriness setting up a sense of foreboding. However, the film dragged a bit from there, and the underlying theme of wondering where Julie Christie was and if the sisters were up to no good didn't create quite the level of tension needed to match up to the promise set in the opening.The film did have Hitchcockian elements and Roeg maximized the Venetian setting. Sutherland and Christie were both on top of their game. A fine, enjoyable movie, just not a great one.",Don't Look Now
122,pinokiyo,YAWN. One word to describe this movie: BORING.,2,17 October 2007,"I realize this movie was made back in the 70's, but real classic movies, whether it's 30-50 years old, can still hold up strong -- even to this day. This movie, however, is not the case. If this movie was released today, it would fail miserably. Too many scenes drag on, and I mean they really drag, and it's very ambiguous -- most of it is very pointless. The movie tries to build up some suspense, but it fails there too. It's a sleeper all the way and no shocking value.I watch a lot of movies every week, but I can't understand how people would love this movie - they must not be very active people. If you want to fall asleep, this movie would be it.I would not recommend this movie at all. Don't waste your time with this one, as time is money and it's not worth it. If you don't care about the story, it may be worth your time for the cinematography (although there's better movies for that too). But that's about it.This movie seems to be praised for the ""husband/wife sex scene"" which is almost pornographic but it inter-cuts of them putting their clothes back on to be more cinematic. Just because the movie uses some clever editing techniques and camera angles DOES NOT MAKE THE MOVIE GOOD. The story is extremely lacking and the pacing is awful. Unless you still sit in a rocking chair with your cat in your lap the entire day, you'll be fast forwarding this movie or turning it off. Actually, sitting in a rocking chair is more exciting than this movie. Oh, if you want to see a scene of a blind psychotic... I mean, psychic, old grandma having an orgasmic panic and fondling her breasts, then knock yourself out with this one.The ending is ridiculous and a joke just like the whole movie plays out. It made me more angry. And to think this movie couldn't have gotten any worse, the ending is just as unsatisfying.This is one movie you will easily forget. As the title suggests, Don't Look (at this movie) NOW.",Don't Look Now

124,Tender-Flesh,Could've been a contender,6,19 December 2009,"Straight off, the only reason I gave this a high 6 was due to the cinematography.Some people won't call this a giallo, but I do. It has all the basic trappings but only succeeds on a scant few levels. Before we get to abominable ending, let's talk up the good points.John and Laura Baxter have taken a ""working vacation"" in Venice due to the recent death of their daughter. The little girl died while wearing a red rain slicker, and as per usual gialli tactics, her size and color are important. Flash forward from the girl's death to their time in Venice as John works on a church restoration. Here we get subjected to Sutherland's infamous nude scene and if there is someone I don't want to see nude, it's Donald. And wearing that hideous wig to boot! Now, later we learn there is a murderer lurking the streets and we see a body fished out of a canal. So, with this back-story under our cap, we move along to some unusual cinematography and truly marvelous shots of dirty yet beautiful Venice back streets. Here is where the movie shines because for most of the film, if I may break it down? I may--All that happens for 3/4 of the movie is John's work on the church, a few spats between John and Laura, some visits with two sisters who may or may not have psychic abilities, and if you don't pay attention you miss it...John has some psychic abilities as well. However, John does not believe in that mumbo-jumbo, so when he has a vision, he doesn't realize what he's seen, and to a stronger point, sometimes we don't either.Oh, yes, I know this is a big deal with a lot of horror fans, but frankly, the ending is such a letdown. John Landis also commented on the silly nature of the killer's reveal. You see, at the finale, John is chasing this little character around the canal-ways who is small and wears a red cloak. Can it be his daughter? Well, are you an idiot? She is dead, of course, so either this person is a ghost(and if the psychic sister is accurate, their daughter is trying to contact them to say she is happy, not run away) or something else entirely, and as he finally reaches the little urchin, we get to see the cinematic equivalent of having the greatest wet dream of your life only to end it just before waking up by realizing you just banged your grandmother. Without making a lick of sense(though, I'll admit, gialli have a tendency to do so), the killer turns out to be an old dwarf woman with a knife and she promptly gives poor John the steel, right in his neck.Then, if you pay attention after this, you'll see where there was some instances earlier on of time criss-cross or John's unreadable visions.Now, for the rant. Granted, the Venice streets are barren, though the windows always have eyes, so if we have a killer running around in a Red Riding Hood getup, that will attract some attention. Also, there aren't enough murders! Yes, we get that he's confused and running around, but give us something else! The chase at the end was enjoyable and seeing the little red hood facing away from him as we all wait nervously to see the identity was a great build-up. But come on! This was as big of a letdown as the witch at the end of Suspiria(granted, that movie is eggs and bacon over Don't Look Now).Now, I won't say don't see this, because you should see it. It does have many redeeming qualities, but I suspect you will also find the killer's identity and total lack of back-story to be utterly moronic. Also, after you watch this, I totally recommend viewing Aldo Lado's 1972 giallo, ""Who Saw Her Die?"". This also has a setting near the canals in Venice and, in my opinion, it smokes Don't Look Now.",Don't Look Now
125,jonathandoe_se7en,Very Cold supernatural thriller...,7,15 September 2001,"Don't Look Now was sadly overlooked in 1973, possibly because of the recent release of The Exorcist, and as much as I admire that film (mainly for Ellen Burstyn's performance) the two are incomparable. Firstly The Exorcist relays on cheep special effects, where as Don't Look Now gets right under the skin. Everything is so subtle that most viewers miss the important stuff.The use of the very grey colour scheme helps set up the coldness of the characters, the events and loss that they have gone through. But THAT opening, brilliant, it's unbelievably one of the best scenes in film history, Nicholas Roeg's camera work and editing are flawless, if you where ever going to do a study on cross-cutting or juxtaposition then Don't Look Now is the film to see.Don't Look Now is a cold and chilling supernatural thriller, with more reasons to see it than the sex scene or the ending (although they are standouts), the performances are also brilliant, with Sutherland and Christie showing a kind of screen chemistry that's very rare nowadays, giving John and Laura the believability the plot requires. This is a great, underrated and as others have said, sadly forgotten film.",Don't Look Now
126,sc8031,You'll want to look twice,7,6 October 2008,"""Don't Look Now"" made its impression on me a little while after I had finished it. During the film itself, I was not particularly confused, shocked or horrified by any of the events on the screen. The film itself is definitely unsettling and a bit creepy, but it is never clear exactly why until one considers it later. On some levels it seems to be an indictment of occultism and spiritualist beliefs. But then the story's methods of foreshadowing and the cyclical, coincidental occurrences later in the plot struck me as a revelation of something ominous, dark and sinister.Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie play John and Linda Baxter, a married couple whose young daughter dies in an accident at their estate in England. Soon after the couple relocate to Venice to work on a job restoring a dilapidating cathedral. In Venice, the locales are notably aloof, the streets are deserted, a killer is on the loose, and a blind psychic claims to see the Baxter's dead daughter. A strange, sad quality lurks behind the environment and strange incidents befall the couple.An important thing to note about the film is how professionally it is made. The entire cast and crew seem to put real effort into the whole production. There is a wonderful original score to accompany the moods and scenery, the Venetian locale is effectively foreboding, and the melancholic desperation of John and Linda bleeds subtly through the story. The movie is apparently famous for its drawn-out love scene (where we get to see more of Donald Sutherland than Julie Christie). It is certainly longer than most mainstream sex scenes, and came across to me as cheesy for the music included (and aren't most movie sex scenes totally over-the-top?). But it works to establish the couple's intimacy early on in the story. All in all, ""Don't Look Now"" won me over as a well-crafted, melancholic little thriller.",Don't Look Now
127,insomnia,A truly disturbing film,9,3 October 1999,"This is truly a 'spooky' film. This is meant in the true sense of the word. Not for Nic Roeg, the cheap, sometimes, risible, 'shock tactics' that directors of lesser talent (and there are plenty of them!), think is the only way to make a scary movie. One example of how chilling this film is, is the scenes in Venice with the little girl in red - which reminds me of that scene in Rosemary's Baby, where Mia Farrow is by herself in her apartment, doors firmly bolted, and Ruth Gordon just waltzes in to see her. ""Don't Look Now"" is a brilliant piece of film making. It cannot be a coincidence that one of the best films about the Australian 'outback', was his film: ""Walkabout"". Incidentally, both ""Don't Look Now"", and ""The Birds"", were based on stories by Daphne Du Maurier.",Don't Look Now
128,andrewburgereviews,Reality is not always what is perceived,10,6 August 2019,"Nicolas Roeg's independent horror masterpiece, ""Don't Look Now"" is a movie which creates a fine line between reality and our perception of it. It plays with the viewer's expectations and desires through the lens of its lead, John Baxter (Donald Sutherland); a rational architect who bashes superstition. The film uses his scientific, shallow way of perceiving the world around him and transports his limitations to the viewer.The film takes place mostly in Venice, Italy. After their daughter Christine dies by drowning into a lake while playing, John and his wife Laura (Julie Christie) go on a self-imposed exile to Venice. There, Laura encounters two elderly sisters, Heather (Hilary Mason) and Wendy (Clelia Matania). Heather, despite being blind, claims she is psychic and that she can ""see"" their now dead daughter with them and being happy. The film is then built on the confrontation between Laura and her husband about the reality of psychic abilities.One thing this movie does brilliantly, is play its supernatural elements with subtlety. Roeg respects the artistic power of mystery and the supernatural. When Laura meets with Heather and Wendy, who hold a séance to try to contact Christine she expects the cliche holding hands and crystal ball to come into play, yet Heather dismisses these elements with a calm frustration: ""Second sight is a gift from the Lord"" she says with a voice which feels carries many burdens. Everything happens strictly on a synaesthetic level.Yet the movie's masterful brilliance comes from its imagery. Roeg portrayed Venice in such a specific manner that you could associate him with it the same way you can associate Scorsese with New York. It is a beautiful town yet here, its ominous. A serial killer is at large, bodies are being dragged out of the city's usually picturesque canals--it is a decaying maze. When Baxter unwraps a statue to be put on a church he is restoring there, it reveals a hideous gargoyle starring at him. Roeg is also using the city's unique design. There are not many actual roads, and it is easy to confuse a back-alley to an actual boardwalk. There are many clever corner shots, one scene in particular when the Baxters went out on an evening and took a wrong turn, out of nowhere, just by turning 90 degrees they popped in the middle of a heavily populated street.The film's cinematography goes even further by preying on the viewer's expectations and predictions. The more observant, intelligent, suspect you are, the more this movie will play you, and the more satisfied will you be when the plot-twist ending is revealed--an ending which is brief and short and comes with no enduring escalation. Everything is a mystery and I had so many questions and with less than 10 minutes remaining, I did not think the movie would be able to settle them, but the ending starts a chain reaction of connections and the startling realization that your perception was used on you. The best example is when we are constantly teased with the apparent ghost of Christine strolling through Venice's fetid alleys. She appears briefly, but she is easily visible by her cherry red trench coat. This is the base on which Roeg builts his twist.Roeg was also bold from another perspective. There is a sex scene between the Baxters, one which is surprisingly explicit for the 1970s. It makes the amount of dedication and ambition obvious. But the scene is not particularly arousing. It is edited with them getting dressed afterwards as if there can never be true everlasting love again for them after the tragedy they went through. It might be the only sex scene to sadden me.""Don't Look Now"" is obviously not the only movie doing one on the viewer with its plot twists, but it is the most subtle one. It pushes you on a totally different path, it knows what you expect and with its insistence on the supernatural, it never hints at such a down-to-earth and logical ending. That few seconds reveal is everything. It watches you in the eyes just like that gargoyle is watching the movie's hard-beat lead.",Don't Look Now

130,csrothwec,A master piece which just gets better with every viewing!,9,25 April 2005,"Saw it when it first came out in the cinema back in the 1970s and thought it was absolutely one of the best! Have seen it five or six times in video format since then and my estimation for it just grows and grows. It is one of those rare films which, like a masterful novel, can be seen and re-seen and each viewing can give you different insights and perspectives. Christie and Sutherland are absolutely superb in every scene and are worth watching again and again. Finally, the scenario, with the decay and collapse of Venice omnipresent, like a stifling, obnoxious fume, is absolutely perfect for this... horror story?... tale of true love redeemed by death?...tragedy in which we chase our hopes and dreams even as they are actually destroying us???? As I say, with each viewing, I find the poetry and the possible interpretations just grab you that much more. Like a fine novel, however, after having reviewed it just recently, I shall wait a while until viewing again. If my estimation continues to grow as it always has done in the past, then it will be heading for a 10/10 in terms of rating! Thank you, Nicholas Roeg!",Don't Look Now
131,Milo-Jeeder,Tries to be clever and full of symbolism... but it's mostly nonsense and pointless ambiguity!,5,16 July 2007,"I honestly had a great enthusiasm towards this film before I watched it and I really longed for a film that would mainly offer a sinister atmosphere for the most part. I had read so many great things about ""Don't Look Now"" and the plot, the locations and the characters looked compelling enough to me to give this movie a chance and be prepared to enjoy an over and done masterpiece. Frankly, I am aware that most people who like this film, are probably going to think I'm terribly brainless because I was somehow disappointed by it, but I would much rather speaking my mind and giving my honest opinion.The main reason why this film turned into a disappointment to me, was mostly the fact that there were quite a lot of scenes that worked as a sleeping pill to me. I think I have seen a decent share of horror films that offer big moments of silence and so-called clever symbolism and subtle details that somehow help to build a solid story. However, in ""Don't Look Now"", I felt a bit overwhelmed by the excessive amount of pointless sequences (and I'm pretty sure they ARE pointless) and images that in the end are reduced to nothing whatsoever. I felt like most of these puzzling and unsolved details, were Nicolas Roeg's way to mystify the audience with discourteous methods and filling blanks to make the movie longer and by some means more ""interesting"" to look at. Nevertheless, opposite to what those chaotic sequences were meant to incite, I felt somehow underestimated and ripped off. This film could have offered the same story and lots of bright symbolism, without the requirement of bombing the audience with tedious states of affair. I'm very supportive of ambiguity in horror films, when help to create a sinister atmosphere, at least. As an example, I'd probably mention Lucio Fulci, whose films are mostly criticized by the great quantity of nonsensical scenes. However, in Mr. Fulci's case, I think the puzzling aspect of his films, at least contribute in a great deal, to develop a terrifying atmosphere. So to make it short and clear, what I condemn the most about ""Don't Look Now"", is its offensive and underestimating ambiguity that leads to nothing at all and simply leaves the audience doubting about their own intelligence.Too bad this film cheats the audience with so many pointless oscillations, because the story itself is not bad at all and the characters look darkly beautiful enough to make a frightening horror film, like the two old sisters, for example. The locations were probably one of the most appealing elements in ""Don't Look Now"" and probably one of the main reasons why I agreed to watch the movie until it was finished instead of just leaving it incomplete. I am not one of those horror fans who expect a big ""EUREKA!"" moment during the last minutes of a film, I can guarantee that. However, I do not appreciate feeling mocked after a movie is finished. I'm sure this comment will be voted as NOT useful several times by people who support this film and think I'm just an airhead who didn't get it, but that's all right I can live with that ;) (My five stars, mostly are due to the locations and a couple of eerie moments that made the whole thing endurable somehow).",Don't Look Now
132,canadude,A Dream Really,8,19 June 2004,"""Don't Look Now"" is a horror film, that's not quite a horror film at all. From the beginning, stunningly shot and directed, it unfolds like a dream. Images connect, but not necessarily in a logical way. They do, however, form (more or less) a disturbingly coherent picture (emotion, dream?).It all starts with the death of a child. The daughter of the Baxters (beautifully played by Julie Christie and [even more beautifully] by Donald Sutherland) drowns. The scene lasts about five minutes - the quiet, uneasy build-up, the alternating takes between the girl running toward the pond with her ball and the parents having an everyday conversation, and the escalation into tragedy. It's not horrifying in an immediate physical sense, but it carries a dreamlike unease.The story then moves to Venice where Donald Sutherland's John works on the restoration of a church, living in a hotel with his wife, Laura. The rest of it is relatively simple: Laura meets two women, one who allegedly possesses second-sight and tells her that her daughter is with them as a ghost and is happy, which convinces Laura that this is indeed true and, when she tells John, he doubts it being pragmatic and rational, creating a rather common and over-done conflict of reason versus belief.However, this seemingly simple story enters into the realm of the subconscious. It almost reminded me with of Paul Verheoven's ""The 4th Man"" without being as vulgarly violent - but it shares a similar theme. How do we explain the coincidences and situations which occur in our daily lives? Are they merely random coincidences with only the meaning we choose to attribute to them? Or are they a part of a general, unknown (divine?) order? In other words, ""Don't Look Now"" is about religion - to some degree of course. More accurately, it is about the meaninglessness versus the meaningfulness of life.While ""The 4th Man"" evolves like a pulpy thriller of coincidences, traps and schizophrenic paranoia, where none of the characters are likable (especially the hero), ""Don't Look Now"" has a darker subtext to it. It doesn't simply jump into strange occurrences and coincidences and play with the viewer's mind - it provides a very real motivation for the way the characters behave and comprehend things the way they do. Grief, the grief for the Baxter daughter, drives Sutherland's John through skepticism and outrage at the insinuation that the daughter is somewhere in limbo. He is the central character because he doubts - but he also sees his daughter. He is thus faced with a very existential problem. He doesn't believe his daughter is alive or even that he can see her - but he follows the little red shape through the foggy street of Gothic Venice. He doubts his own cause, he doubts that it has any meaning, that his daughter is indeed alive, yet he knowingly chases her image because he has to know for himself. The question, of course, is how do deep emotions of loss and grief affect our worldly perception? What is belief in the reason behind the things we see? Are they merely a picture painted by our imagine or, once again, are they incredibly real?The film raises these questions, and rightly so, but I don't think it deals with them completely. While I don't think this is a bad thing, I do find the ending anti-climactic and consider it an attempt to tie things in a nice little package. It's a cop-out - an answer to a question which we cannot answer. Nonetheless, ""Don't Look Now,"" even if you don't accept its premise and the questions that can be derived from it, is flawlessly directed and performed. The film's survival can be attributed to Sutherland and Christie and Roeg's searching camera, and the way it evokes that ethereal region where strange things happen sometimes without logical explanation, but manage to reveal us to ourselves.",Don't Look Now

A killer is on the loose, and a psychic, traveling with her sister, also come into the picture. The two leads have never been better, and when first released , this movie became famous for its strange editing in which ideas were conveyed by little visual suggestions.

135,med_1978,This Movie was not what I expected at all !,1,23 November 2005,"I Cannot believe the amount of good reviews I have seen of this movie. A friend of mine had seen and told me he found it boring and meaningless and confusing. He also had a similar view of Memento, which I thought was excellent. Bearing this in mind coupled with the reviews I had read, I sat down to watch this with my Brother. I was horrified at the complete nonsense before me. I found the acting from Julie Christie to be incredibly wooden (a blank look on her face most of the time), Donald Sutherland was slightly better but his ridiculous hairstyle didn't help. The dialogue was totally ridiculous and clichéd and the lines were delivered badly. The Sex Scene was absolute nonsense it seemed staged and not natural and was badly shot, you could easily tell they were acting (or trying to). Admittedly I only watched the first 75 mins but the story, pace and intensity did not look like it was getting any better. My Brother and I mutually agreed to turn over to see what else was on, as we had reached the same conclusion regarding this film. The Boring attempts to be chilling were very badly done (i.e the two old women one with second sight and the poorly staged séance etc.) , maybe in the 1970's this may have seemed chilling. But the film certainly does not stand the test of time. There have been far better films of this type made. For Instance this film was not in the class of The Sixth Sense. I am not addicted to Blockbusters and crap like Armageddon and The Fast and the Furious, so this is not down to my IQ. I often seek out small low budget films of different genres and appreciate them.",Don't Look Now
136,Preston-10,The metaphysical and the skeptical,10,7 October 2003,"Don't Look Now gets typecast as a horror film even though the movie has a few sparse elements of a horror film (some blood, gore, murder, grotesques), nevertheless they are so incredibly effective that that's what tends to stay with people long after they see it. The whole movie is conveyed in the title: `Don't Look Now', a warning. It implies something that is in someone's sight but not in your own, the most significant aspect being the danger that awaits the husband, but that which he cannot see. In this movie the husband and wife are both psychic but one is more willing to accept it than the other. The movie enforces this notion through their different reactions to a traumatic experience. For the wife, she lights candles in the church after she meets the two women (I doubt John Edwards could have such a positive effect). I like how the movie utilizes its primary theme about the metaphysical elements that we posses, and accept though the sheer willingness to accept, or deny through skepticism. One of my favorite scenes in the film, and its one that a lot of people miss, is the scene where Donald and Julie are walking at night and Julie get scared by a rat, and he utters something long the lines of `I've been here before'. Deja-Vu, and yet he goes off, and doesn't give it a second thought. This film is also one of the most effective examples of location and the story going hand-in-hand, similar to Kubrick's `The Shining'. I had The Third Man's Vienna in mind when I saw this film because the labyrinth-like atmosphere of Vienna reminded me so much of Venice in this movie. Roeg got this right.",Don't Look Now

Something about it fails to engage my emotions, and I suppose I'll never know what that is. I truly enjoy Walkabout (1971), The Man Who Fell to Earth (1976), Bad Timing (1980), Two Deaths (1995) and even the young adults film The Witches (1990).

What's in between doesn't really seem to matter ...... much of it being disjointed and ""jolting"" in an unpleasant way.  Not that I'm thrashing this revered work of art, just that there's really too much symbolism and not enough, getting to the point.One part of the movie where they seem to have no problem with ""getting to the point"" is the very bold sex scene.  Very erotic stuff here and the film maker and the actors should be applauded for seeing this part of the ""vision"" through, as this is one of the scenes that really works.John and Laura are truly connected, the chemistry is there and with no awkwardness from other scenes.One of the reasons the sex scene works so well, is there is little need for dialog, and other scenes where dialog is _really_ needed (so you aren't just left guessing at what was meant by some avant garde camera work) it isn't there.Oh, John denies his needs emotionally and Laura is emotionally needy all over the place.

141,HorrorFreak1997,One of the most unique and suspenseful films of all-time,10,4 April 2014,"Don't look now is a true masterpiece. The first time I watched it I went into it assuming I was in for a regular run of the mill ghost story. Oh no. I was very wrong. This movie is far more than just a ghost story actually. The film drops us into the life of a grieving married couple (who are played by Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie, and their performances are wonderful. They have great chemistry.) that just lost their daughter. The first question that I as the viewer asked myself was is the ghost of their daughter trying to contact them? If so, what for? To warn them? If so of what? Many questions already enter your mind as the film is only just beginning. We are left in the dark for much of the film which is an important aspect in regards to what makes the film so suspenseful and mysterious. The plot is not spoon fed to you and requires you to actually think about the characters and the story. This forces you to get immersed in the film. The movie just keeps us guessing, the entire time the story progresses in different directions and creates more questions. Is the figure in the red coat the ghost of the couple's deceased daughter? Is the serial murderer running around Venice supposed to be what their daughter's ghost is attempting to warn them about? That is if she is actually trying to warn them at all. Is their daughter's spirit even present. Or is it just that the couple are so damaged its all in their heads? The freaky elderly woman foretell a dark future for the couple and tell them to leave Venice before it's to late. All of these questions merge into one huge suspenseful masterwork that has your heart pounding out of your chest by the time the last 20 minutes are before us. The climax of this film literally had my eyes glued to the screen and my teeth clenched as I sat in the dark in pure suspense. I won't reveal anymore about the plot because I feel as if I've already revealed to much. On to the cinematography. The camera work, lighting, and set design are all TOP notch. Not to mention the score is absolutely pulse-pounding. As well on top of all this the acting is superb on everybody's part. There is absolutely nothing negative I can say about this film. It really is one of the best horror films ever made. Just go watch it right now and be in awe.The verdict: 10/10 a masterpiece that's so suspenseful you won't even know what to do with yourself.",Don't Look Now
142,aztrshbyz,"Not a horror movie, but a good supernatural thriller/drama",7,29 August 2017,"Although DON'T LOOK NOW shows up on horror film lists here and there, it is really not a horror film per se. It is more of a drama/thriller with paranormal elements and a shock ending. The movie is about a husband and wife who are grieving the loss of their daughter to a drowning. They move to Venice for work where they meet a pair of sisters; one is blind and claims to be psychic and in touch with the couple's daughter. She warns them that something terrible is going to happen if they don't leave Venice. The husband, meanwhile, is having some visions of his own. I don't want to give away more of the plot in that it would spoil the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it, but will say the movie has an unexpected ending where almost everything comes together and a lot of unexplained happenings are resolved. The ending is likely why the movie has found itself on some horror lists.As a side note, DON""T LOOK NOW was partially filmed in Italian, but you don't have to speak the language to understand what is happening in those sections. It was also considered scandalous upon it's release due to a sex scene which was pretty graphic for the time.The film is somewhat slow in parts but keeps you guessing until the end regarding all of the unexplained phenomena. Although bored for short periods of time, I found the movie engrossing overall. I thought it was well acted by all of the characters and thought the film was shot in a really interesting way. I wouldn't be able to recommend this movie to a horror fan - there are not enough of those elements to excite someone who loves the genre.

But enough, already.The film story is outlined again and again in previous viewers' opinions, so that we will dispense with. The story is what it is and you either give yourself over to it or not. Wise to say yes, I think. We will also quickly get over the fact of the 70's, when the film was made, when men's hair and clothing left everything to be desired, thus the fine actor, Mr. Sutherland, looks a bit silly in our hindsight, which is all we have now. On the other hand, Julie Christie looks just fine in her suburban housewife's pert clothing, accompanied by a figure that leaves the viewer grateful for the differences in the species. The semi-famous love scene is semi-good, with that pre-post coital cutting dizzy making and aesthetically wrong. But she is lovely, yes.The setting could not be better. You could do Chain Saw Massacre in Venice and get my attention. A lovely, dark, romantic, corrupt, atmospheric dream, the sinking city. But...Mr. Roeg far too often gives himself over to his weakness, the eye of an interior decorator. Or a romantic still photographer? A shot by shot analysis says...oh, nice, great set-up, pretty shot, good eye, oh yes!

This movie is even worse, treating us to an awkward and cringe inducing sex scene that seems like it will never end. I suppose the director thought this was his ticket to success, as the rest of the movie is just dumb. The 70's bad hair, a very noticeable wig on Donald Sutherland, the ugly clothes, the weird atmospherics that promise but lead to nothing are more reminders that this is a pretentious and regrettable film from the decade of film crossing over into less about a story and acting, and more about what a film can get away with in language and nudity.

It's up to you (and me). On the face of it Julie Christie is losing her grip in her grief and her inability to let go of her drowned daughter, whilst Sutherland is giving her a harsh dose of the rational.But, ultimately, it's Sutherland who can't cope with his sense of guilt over his child's death, whilst Christie's clutching at supernatural straws is a symptom of a mother's natural grieving.Who, or what, is the creature in the red coat? Does Christie ever actually see it, or does she just believe what she's told? I need to see the movie again to figure that one out. But Sutherland certainly sees it, which leads to horrific calamity.Is it the Venice serial killer? Is it some kind of emanation of his daughter? Or is it his tortured imagination and overwhelming guilt leading him to disaster?Every incidental character is wonderfully creepy, from the anxious hotel manager to the weird old British tourists and the seemingly-knowing cop.

150,Parca,Yep. Look later... Watch other films first.,6,23 December 2001,"I fail to get the ""brilliance"" of the film.  Roeg does some editing that is interesting by moments but that is just pure show-off at other moments, detracting from the story.  Perhaps this was done because the story is nearly non-existent.  It starts out with a good, chilly introduction, depicting a little girl's drowning.  Then it goes nowhere - well, it goes to Venice, and just sits around, waiting for something to happen.  The entire sense of horror comes from two old ladies, one whom is blind and has a face that is hard to look at.  One (or both?) is psychic, who claims to be able to speak to the dead daughter of the couple.  Donald Sutherland's character has a few visions which he cannot distinguish from reality (nor can we), which creates some more tension - but not much more, except for confusion, most of which is cleared up in the end.  And there's a couple of moments in which the lead characters are in danger.  It's all a bunch of red herrings. You are basically waiting around for a story to start, and it never does. That is, until you reach the very ending, which pretty much comes out of nowhere, constructed out of bits and pieces of things leftover from throughout the flick.  And Roeg throws in one of the most bizarre (and unexpected) killers in all horror movie history.  Clips from the entire movie flash before our eyes.  An odd, chilling funeral scene follows.  The End.  This pads out 100+ minutes of film, which could have been shortened to 50, given the lack of material.  Don't get me wrong; I enjoy long horror films with stylish direction, as long as the director can keep things interesting.  Roeg does little here, unfortunately.Oh yes, and there's a sex scene somewhere in there, which has become famous. What the hell is so special about the legendary sex scene?  It's not particularly erotic.  It's quite tame and rather cold.  And the cuts with scenes of the characters dressing up is distracting, not ""artsy"".  Roeg has been able to do more erotic scenes in his other films (e.g. ""Performance""). It doesn't help that Donald Sutherland was going through his odd-looking phase, with the large curly hair.In my opinion, only the beginning and the ending are worthwhile.

After it is over and has become a complete(d) work to the eye of the viewer, the lasting impression is that of mystery. Too many films in this genre bark up the wrong tree, working to explain all of the events that unfold. By explaining nothing, by being almost abstract, questions and images will haunt the viewer indefinitely. It is what it is, and while this movie can be watched over and over, and the events that occur can be anticipated, they will forever remain an enigma. This is true cinema, purely visual and aural, without the helpful but ultimately self-defeating aid of a proxy observer; the viewer is the direct observer, and there's no filter through which the events and images develop any sort of tidy rationality.Donald Sutherland's performance here is sober, adult, the grief of his character palpable. And in the face of this grief is a force that runs through the movie like a dark current, evoking the eternal and spookily ethereal and subterranean; less an eternity of the heavens than the eternity of a crypt. Venice is not merely the ideal location for this story, but the necessary location; it could not take place anywhere else. The unquestionable, and indeed imposing, Gothic majesty of the churches, whose interior height dwarfs their human occupants with the spiritual dread of the ancient, overlooks the canals of Venice like the wicked-faced stone gargoyles Sutherland finds himself physically embracing, while the canals that run through the city are literally the ghost of this couple's personal tragedy. Living in Venice, in light of the details surrounding their loss, seems almost a perverse choice, perhaps a masochistic one; they could be punishing themselves for their daughter's drowning by living in a flooded city.It's not that Sutherland's character is a rational man in an irrational environment, but rather a rational man in an environment whose own secret code, which one may trust makes perfect sense to itself (like a tree in the forest that will only fall if no one is around to hear), is inaccessible and inexplicable to him, baring itself only in fragments in a way he chooses to ignore, just as you might ignore a spectral voice in the dead of night, dismissing it as a product of your imagination.The movie's notorious love scene is jarringly explicit, yet rather than erotic, it is profoundly sad, and takes on a deeper (even creepy) resonance after the film ends. That the scene is intercut with scenes of Sutherland and Julie Christie dressing prevents the two from ever being completely naked and united; this editing choice changes the dimensions of the love scene in a way that I've never seen attempted elsewhere. At other points, Roeg inserts moments and images that carry sinister implications, none of which are ever concretely substantiated and only leave the viewer with more questions.The film drifts along at a wandering pace. The final twenty minutes are among the most atmospheric and suspenseful twenty minutes in any film, culminating in a montage that is absolutely chilling.'The Blair Witch Project,' made over two decades later and probably influenced by this, has similar aspirations, but finally has only a fraction of the emotional gravity.",Don't Look Now
155,smoothhoney1265,Has it shocking moments but I wouldn't necessarily give it the rating it has,5,2 May 2007,"I don't know, for me this is not one of the best movies of all time. It was a nice time-passer, has its thrilling moments, but in my opinion too many chances and ideas were wasted in this film.What's with this blind, screaming woman always announcing that John was in danger? (I know her role.) They could have got more out of this instead of letting her scream every ten minutes and look frightened all the time. Because all the time the film tries to let her and her sister look freaky, but in the end they are just two normal women. (And more normal than the ""normal"" characters, I must add.)What also was annoying was this endless wandering of the main characters, especially Donald Sutherland, through some dark corners of Venice. Honestly, after this movie you get the impression that Venice is a city inhabited by ghosts, murderers and freaks, is always dirty and dark and if you visit it you cannot be sure to get out of it alive.I liked some moments and the ending, for it gave away the twist, but my personal highlight of this film is Julie Christie whom I have never seen in a movie before. She was elegant, emotional, very beautiful and intelligent - simply a pleasure to watch and some so-called ""Hollywood"" actresses from today surely could learn one or two things from her.To sum it up: Typical horror trash - and I have seen better before. But Julie Christie gives the film a touch of class.",Don't Look Now
156,madsmartinussen,The perfect combo,10,27 October 2021,"I don't scare easily. I was hesitant about watching this film, because I have never been scared of any horror film made before 1990 (maybe even later). The horror genre keeps improving and the demand for terror and shock become higher and higher, with great examples of modern classics being Sinister, Hereditary and the Conjuring 1-2 (haven't seen 3 yet). I liked films like The Excorcist and Hellraiser, and I LOVE Alien and The Shining, but none of them ever REALLY scared me, all the while I was extremely bored by other classics like Halloween and The Thing. The closest thing I've been to the brilliance of this film was of course Rosemary's Baby, but even that kinda bored me at times, and in my view it's not even close to this one.Don't Look Now is a BRILLIANT film. Considering the time, I can't imagine how scary it must have been. The atmosphere of dread just keeps developing, to the point where my heart was pounding for the last 30-something minutes. It's unnerving, eerie and the two sisters are some of the creepiest characters I've ever seen, even though they never really do anything much. Don't get me wrong, by today's standards I'd consider it more of a somber paranormal thriller, but that still says a lot.More than that it's a touching and sad film about loss and love and how the two somehow needs to coexist for people to move on. This film moved me almost to tears. If I've learned anything about films, it's that all the best horror films have a strong emotional core, like (to name another modern classic) The Babadook. It's heartbreaking, and it's that classic combo of sadness and dread, if done right, that somehow makes the whole ordeal even more terrifying.This movie does it right, it does everything right, and it stuck with me for weeks after. I forgot about Halloween 3 minutes after I turned off the TV.",Don't Look Now
157,theblackscythe,"A bizarre and unique psychological thriller, with some knockout scenes.",8,31 October 2014,"(Halloween Horror Reviews #15)Considered by many to be a masterpiece of psychological horror, Don't look now is undoubtedly a well made movie. It is a slice of 70's paranoia thriller on the level of 'The Conversation' and 'Taxi Driver'. It creates an incredible atmosphere and uses a top-notch location (Venice) in a unique and subtle way. Any filmmaker who wishes to master the art of forming an eerie atmosphere should defiantly check this film out.The film's main actors are all superb. Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland work absolute magic every second they are on screen, their emotional weight and passion is something truly staggering. They are a huge part of why the film is so effective. The supporting cast is also solid, however may often seem lacking when compared to the two powerhouses at the centre of the film.The film has some of the best sound-mixing around, creating a great sense of panic for the audience and making every scene as disorienting as a bad nightmare. The paranoid sense of dread is emphasised by the bleak and cold setting. Venice feels hostile and angry, it works as a driving force throughout the film and puts the audience all the more on edge.The film can feel convoluted and jumbled at times in it's plotting. Characters will lack relevance regardless of screen time, and plotpoints will seemingly go nowhere. This, along with the sometimes lacklustre pace are by far the film's largest problems for me.However the film's opening and closing scenes are fantastic. Emotional, cerebral and horrifying, both in drastically different ways. These scenes are where the film shines brightest for sure.Overall, whilst clunky and a little dated in it's execution, Don't look now is a stunning horror/thriller and shows many truly inspired elements and sequences.",Don't Look Now

Such is the case of ""Don't Look Now"". From its heartbreaking opening sequence to its depressing settings of Venice, and through its lyrical symbolism (red, glass and water are dazzlingly repeated throughout the film) right up to its terrifying climax, ""Don't Look Now"" is a mystifying tour de force, a cinematic enigma that keeps its answers deep into the darkest realms of metaphysics and human psyche. An enchanting, unforgettable experience. Magnificent.",Don't Look Now

160,tone143,Do Look Now!,8,26 June 2004,"Let me start by saying that any Roeg film is worth watching(the guy could shoot a bowl of soup and create tension).""The Man Who Fell To Earth"",and ""Walkabout"" are personal favorites of mine,the whole theme of alienation and the inexorable change produced by a collision of world psychologies being a natural for Roeg.Instead of super-sensitive alien out to rescue his planet from dehydration(which is really an optional pretext,the film not really being about that),or the primal awakenings of two young Australian kids left to their own devices in the outback by their psychotic father,forging a life-changing relationship with an aboriginal boy,""Don't Look Now"" is essentially the story of a man whose devotion to detail and rationality blinds him to the psychogenic realm,and his own inherent ability to see into it,that he ends up dying a gruesome and bizarrely unpredictable death.Why this man is punished by fate,or God,or by his own stubbornness is one of the most elusive metaphysical ideas I've ever seen in a film.I believe that contained in the moment,where Sutherland ""sees"" his daughter's drowning,AND the melting slide photo with the blood cascading from what at that point in the film we believe to be his daughter,in her plastic red raincoat,sitting in one of the pews in the picture of a church he'll soon be restoring,is the key to the mystery.An unholy parallelism seems to be hatched here-his very human,and TOTAL love and concern for his daughter has blinders on it(whose doesn't?),and any ominous clairvoyance on his part is relegated to his subconscious.In any case,this is a totally unique movie,and the strange sisters lend a great,modern Shakespearian feel to the film.Obviously,Roeg's cinematography is outstanding!",Don't Look Now
161,philiposlatinakis,Not quite a classic,6,18 December 2020,"Don't Look Now is a mixed bag. It has the hand-held camera work and zooms of which Nicolas Roeg is so enamored, which are just distracting. It's very gimmicky with the ""red"" motiff and the mirrors. But the performances are excellent and the story is interesting, if superficial. It's not a horror film, and it's certainly not scary. It's basically about grief, ESP, and a murder mystery in the background. The final shocker isn't so shocking, but it works. There is one gratuitous sex scene in the film. It has a function, but it didn't need to be that explicit or to go on so long. Why it's rated 15 on DVD in the UK instead of 18, I don't know. Flaws aside, it's an engaging film, considered a classic, but not quite.",Don't Look Now
162,evetilly,Probably For Patient Viewers Only,6,10 April 2020,"Don't Look Now might not be a movie for everyone. Less patient viewers will be put off by the slow, deliberate pacing and lack of actual scares, but powering through it will still make you appreciate you saw it even if it doesn't totally land with you.There are many little tiny scenes that could have easily been trimmed here and there, but the performances of Sutherland and Christie as grieving parents are so great, Roeg's atmosphere is so thick, and Donaggio's lush score is so beautiful that you can forgive just about anything.The ending is still a sucker punch to this day and one of the most haunting sequences ever filmed. It's so good that it can almost make you forget about any pacing issues. It most definitely makes it worth seeing along with an incredibly frank sex scene between Sutherland and Christie that's still shocking in its explicitness and tenderness.",Don't Look Now
163,dmkay,"Yes, this movie is a cure for insomnia!",3,4 August 2003,"Man, I thought I'd seen some boring overrated movies before, like Polanski's ""Repulsion,"" but this one must be the worst.  After a nice opening scene, ""Don't Look Now"" proceeds to show some characters, who are mostly uninteresting, walk around and have little day-to-day type problems, have a little sex, blah blah blah.  Oh trust me, there's no story at all.  And there's not a trace of suspense or surprise until the very end, which comes out of left field and is very silly.  This is the kind of movie where normal, everyday events are supposed to be scary merely because a stinger was added to the musical score.  If you watch it with the sound off, I guarantee you will fall asleep in minutes! 
The other really annoying habit of this movie is its tendency to show something innocuous, like a broach, and zoom in on it as if this is something important that we're supposed to be interested in.  In every single case it turns out to be completely irrelevant.  As a result, the viewer is actually conditioned to ignore the movie's details...if the director won't play fair by giving these scenes a payoff, why bother paying attention at all?  Overall, the only emotion this film can create is confusion and a deep, deep desire to shut the damn thing off half-way through.  3 out of 10.",Don't Look Now

The death of the little girl and the finding of the body must be one of the most dramatical scenes i have ever seen. A couple of months go by and this people are living in Venice.

This was a fascinating film from start to finish. I had no idea where it was headed, and the writer/director did a good job of keeping a great sense of mystery throughout the film. The great thing about the 'girl' in the red mack is that you think Sutherland is hallucinating when he sees her in Venice. And, after you see/hear the psychic give the final warning - you think he'll meet his fate accidentally. (They set this up very nicely with the almost-fatal accident in the church). The visuals add a lot of dynamism to this work, and halfway through I knew I'd have to see this film again to catch the allusions and references it was making. My only criticisms are that it does drag somewhat, and some of the direction is a bit haphazard at times. But this can't detract the fact that this is easily one of the greatest thrillers of all time.",Don't Look Now

167,Nemesis7293-1,"God Save Us From An ""Artiste""",2,20 June 2010,"Epically pretentious, maddeningly incoherent mangling of Daphne DuMaurier's excellent short story. Beautiful to look at with very good performances all around and a characteristically wonderful score by Pino Donaggio. All of this is squandered by director Roeg in his sadistic quest to screw the audience out of any explanation whatsoever. There are characters, subplots, and countless shots of ordinary objects and places that seem to be heavy with portent, yet are utterly pointless and without meaning....the ""Why the hell is it there"" mini-porn being a prime example. The editing is not simply non-linear, it is purposely disorienting. I find it quite strange that films which are by accident incoherent viewed as bad, while films that are incoherent by design - ""2001"", ""Blow Up"" anyone? - are somehow works of genius. I'll never understand how a film stubbornly refusing to explain itself is a good thing. ""Don't Look Now"" is, in the end, nothing more than Nicolas Roeg masturbating to his own ""genius"" for two hours. I hope it was at least good for him.",Don't Look Now

This masterpiece of horror belongs without any doubt on top 5 horrors ever made. My favorite one is definitely THE SHINING by Stanley Kubrick, but this one is on the second place. Brilliant directing, extremely relaxing acting, philosophical camera work, perfect lights, pace, music and suspense. VERY VERY SUSPENSEFUL film. It grows on you as I said after the first minute.

This film made me angry and that is not entirely its fault. It is the fault of those in the movie-going public who let on that this is a film to see! Almost 2hrs of watching Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie do nothing of consequence. When things did happen, they had nothing to do with each other- random events. None of them led anywhere!! They had sex- so(it is truly amazing what passed for 'in shape' back then)? Donald almost gets hurt on a scaffold- so? He thinks he sees her in Venice when she's supposed to be in England- so? Does he call her? No! He goes right to missing persons?? Finally in the last seven minutes of the film he is killed by a dwarf in the same raincoat that his daughter was wearing when she died- so?

With the superstars Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie in the two leading roles you can say that this movie really was good filled in its leading roles. I read that this movie was supposed to be a horror-thriller, which takes place under occult circumstances in a very Gothic looking Venice. Sounds really interesting I thought  so I bought the movie on DVD and was very excited to see it. It starts good with the mysterious death of the family's daughter. Then her parents travel to Venice where Donald Sutherland's character has to make some architecture work. In this city they meet a psychic woman and her companion. This psychic woman now warns the couple that something bad is going to happen if they stay in Venice. From this point and until the end of the movie nothing exciting really happens. The end is a bid weird I thought; when an old dwarf of a lady kills Donald's role.

Donald Sutherland plays John Baxter who restores old Venetian churches or something like that. Julie Christie plays his wife. Both of them are actually pretty good and close to how Du Maurier wrote the original characters. But soon enough we're subjected to a bizarre, extended sex scene that is inter-cut with footage of the couple getting dressed. Not only does this make absolutely no sense, we also have to look at Donald Sutherland's bony ass for six or seven minutes. There's other strange scenes and confusing red herrings thrown in that really do nothing to advance the story, including a slightly sinister Catholic bishop who wasn't in the original source material. The religious imagery and aspects to this film keep suggesting that it's about to turn into something like The Omen, but it never does, which is a shame, because even an Omen rip-off would have been more welcome than this thing. The director would have done better to follow the original story a bit closer - if you haven't read it, you'll be lost watching this mess and you'll have to be content with enjoying on-location footage of early 1970s Venice, Italy, which is one of this film's few redeeming qualities.",Don't Look Now

178,sledgehammer86,"Outstanding movie, quite unlike any other movie out there",10,20 January 2013,"Don't Look Now has always done something quite unlike any other movie out there: I am able to totally emerge in it. Every re-watch sheds new light on several details I did not notice before. It is indeed a movie that increasingly gets better with every re-watch.Roeg's movie is an incredibly layered movie. His editing and camera work are highly effective in creating associations between scenes and images that are narratively not immediately related. The famous sex scene is always mentioned as the best example in this movie of his intertwined cutting. It is indeed beautifully done, but there is so much more of the intertwined cutting. The images of water and glass are constantly used to re-evoke the death of the couple's daughter. As characters turn their head, Roeg switches to characters in another place, also turning their head, relating them as if they were in one room. It strengthens the movie's second sight theme through mere visuals.Venice is beautifully shot. Not as a postcard, but as a place of dread, grief and fear. This Venice is like a mortuary, devoid of people and beauty. It tries to put the characters wandering through it on a wrong track, wanting them either gone or devouring them inside.Sutherland and Christie are realistically human. Sutherland seems to simultaneously underact and overact at first, but easing in, he fits extremely well in his character. Christie manages to get across the loving, but slightly unstable traits of her character. It is just Sutherland and Christie though that seem human (and even Sutherland's character is portrayed in an ambiguous way at points). Other supporting characters seem as much part of the dread of Venice. The father, the chief of police and the two sisters are extremely ambiguous: their eyes do frighten more than they reassure you.Many people have been disappointed by the ending twist and it possibly is in a first watch. But this particular scene is the key to the whole movie: the story is an existential one, about fate. All of the themes in the story before are strengthened by it. It is a much more satisfying one than what would be expected. And indeed, during re-watches the scene is stronger than it ever was: it is an absolutely chilling scene.Don't Look Now is so often overlooked. If you haven't yet, watch it.

The ending left me disappointed thinking of other things that could have been.... if only they hadn't thrown a little old midget woman into it.

With them being in Venice the audience feel like the characters as they are in a country that they don't know, don't speak English and in other tenses are Isolated from everyone else, which is a common convention of a horror film.The love scene is rather lengthy with editing that influence the film Out Of Sight with the love shots and when they are getting changed. When a sex scene comes in mind it is usually not showing love and more of a quick and rather obnoxious sign of love. Sex scenes come in films like American Psycho and the more amusing of scenes like American Pie both beginning with American summing up the Americans love lives or what's left. But with Monsters Ball 'Sex' scene they are more about love and gaining love. The scene is an important part of the narrative where we are left with the idea that Laura was pregnant the scene at the end helps with that idea when the liquid is spilt and the liquid looks like the ovule. With John dead as well it's a life for a life.The colour red is a significant thing in the film, it probably has more screen time then Julie Chrisite. The colour red comes up so many times even if its obvious or if it is a little hint in the back ground. The opening sequence with the daughter dying has red flowers behind Julie Christie before turning around and screaming, a red rose stands for a loss of a love and I feel is a vital thing in the scene. The colour red means danger, passion, love, stop and anger. These are all vital in each scenes with the red coat at the end with the dwarf the colour red means danger and stop other wise you will be killed. The red coat at the beginning is the total opposite with John passionately holding his daughter and the love that he has for her.I did like the movie, the editing during the love scene was great and obviously was just like Out Of Sight but didn't have a love scene. The film was confusing and quite tiring to understand with scenes and objects that you have to think and remember I am usually a fan of films that you have to watch closely but this was to confusing. The story line was excellent. The film was atmospheric thanks to the editing and music and spine chilling with the finale. We were told as an audience that there was a murderer and was always at the back of my mind so you forget and when you finally see the murderer there is an element of surprise and the director laughing at me as I'm too naive to remember. The opening sequence shots looked amazing with the damp mist in the real country side of Britain. I can't wait for the Hollywood version, not! as they make a lazy attempt at re-making a classic British film.",Don't Look Now
184,sjl004,It bored me due to the absence of tension then it GETS you!,6,13 July 2004,"This film contains spoilers, it is mainly what happens in the storyline and my interpretation of the events.In all honesty I thought it was an Italian director who made this film. Being largely set it Venice I didn't notice the director's part in the Cinematography in the film.  I can now see how the narrow tight and some times dirty, rat ridden dead end passages can be quite scary. 
We start in Hertfordshire, England close to where I was born.  My senses pricked up when I see a girl in a red cloak step on a pane of glass in the large garden setting.  The film, mainly due to the direction seems slow, although I give it its merit from the use (and later reuse) of following the girl via her reflection in the pond.  This reflection later seen is in fact off water from a Venetian canal.  This later use of water might explain the use of Venice (due to the vast number of waterways (and having been there, the water like the pond is rather filthy).When the credits come up with ""adapted from a Daphne Du Maurier novel"" the first thing that came into my mind was the film Rebecca (to avoid a spoiler, so to next paragraph) and the image I saw was a drowned girl).
It surprised me that this scenario occurred in this film, and we now focus on the parents.They move to Venice as the father (Donald Sutherland is an architect).  His wife is told about her daughter by a odd pair of sisters, and the blind and psychic one tells her about what happened to her.This film now has a plot to which we can follow.  We are watched a woman slightly go mad, yet the husband brings her to her senses and we witness a long raw sex act, between the two of them.The husband catches strange glances, including his wife with the two ladies on a river taxi going the other way and upon calling loudly she doesn't look or respond.  The couple had earlier been told that their son was injured in England and the wife planned to fly back straight away.  The husband has a near fatal accident at work and the blind lady told his wife about a potential danger.Visions of their daughter in a red cloak (no face seen) appears at random in Venice, fist by her mother, then by her father).  He goes to the sisters home to find they are detained by the murder squad (the detective following the father is also quite well directed, although more music would have built on the suspense.He then proceeds with them to them accommodation; the wife returns, is taken to the station; is shown a picture, of the killer then dashes to the sisters location.  The couple just miss each other, and this adds much needed tension to a film that wasn't sure where it was going (a little like then middle of Citizen Kane).  The husband chases a person resembling his daughter into a church and up the levels into a room.The tension is great and the suspense, now abundant, the cloaked person finally turned to reveal a scary midget brandishing a knife.  She promptly slashes the husband and he dies slowly.We are presented with flashbacks, the smashing pane of glass is now the a window in the church the husband kicks out, the wife and sisters on the river taxi were in fact on there way to her husbands funeral and the red cloaked woman, respects evil.  Yet from where is a mystery?  The amazing use of flashbacks, which are incredible is films like Mulholland Drive credit this film, yet unfortunately the lack of interest in the main bulk of this film merely lets this film achieve a ""Good; six out of ten"" status.  I believe it also influenced Dressed to Kill (1980) yet lack of suspense, sex scenes, then BAMM a murder.  Its original, yet not always a winner.",Don't Look Now
185,alchemical-38692,I created an account to call this movie out,3,5 February 2020,"Okay. I will confess a few things. I consider myself not just a horror movie connoisseur, but a movies-in-general connoisseur. I've been to film school, and I've reviewed movies for a job. Getting that out of the way, my advice to you is, unless you're over 50, don't watch this movie!
I hadn't heard about it until I found one of those ""50 Greatest Horror Movie"" lists, and lo & behold this movie was around 25 and I hadn't seen it, so I looked it up, downloaded it thinking nothing could go wrong, I mean it has stellar ratings on IMDB, and they wouldn't lie to us!
That has to change.
Firstly this is in no way a horror. A thriller? ... I'd say mildly. Put it this way, when the end approached, I thought ""nothing scary has happened yet, it must be a twist like The Usual Suspect's"" and then womp wah,
The end.
This is a horrible boring movie, with nothing going for it and no redeeming features. I have no idea why it's so highly rated but my only guess is old people perhaps haven't seen the ""real"" horror movies I would consider ""scary"" because honey, scary this ain't it. As a thriller it's a 4. As a horror it's a 2.

186,Danny_84,"Good, in a confusing sort of way",7,28 September 2002,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS'Don't Look Now' certainly had a creepy premise but with only the few following exceptions it failed to live up to the horror I was led to expect. The film has a deeply disturbing last scene in which you are left with the idea of witnessing your own funeral which I think would give anyone a chill down their back.Aside from that there wasn't really much horror for me. The bloody murder scene was more confusing than anything else - unlikely killer that's for sure. There is a large part of the middle of the film where I got a bit lost, but got back on track for the finale.Acting was excellent from both Sutherland and Christie. It also features a touching love scene, which although very beautiful adds nothing to the plot (if anything slows it down) and gives nothing to character development, so I can't help but wonder what its point is, but it was very nicely done - they really do look like they are making love.Certainly worth watching for the performances if nothing else.7/10",Don't Look Now

Both of them give excellent performances as always, and you'll never think of Venice the same way again.  The ending is a bit of a let down-- it felt forced after the foreboding build up.

189,Ascola,"study in dark, watery and red",8,25 June 2007,"It's always fun to watch a good 70ies movie almost 35 years later, because any exquisite cinematography like in this film adds an aesthetic and historical pleasure to watching it, to what people already loved when the film appeared first.I'm wondering why the film didn't receive more rewards in his time. The ""SZ-Cinemathek"" - a collectors choice of best films ever chosen by one of the three leading newspapers in Germany - lists ""Don't look now"" in his Top 50, and I can understand why.In the first scenes shot in Hertfordshire, England, we think that John Baxter can see his child's death even though he's not near her, but later we understand that his child's death is the beginning of his foreseeing his own death. The tragedy about it is that he doesn't realize he does. Trying to be a rational guy who wants to protect his supposedly unstable wife from the supernatural, we - not him - realize that it is he himself who is closest to the irrational. Though Laura doesn't fully understand his condition she tries to protect him understanding more of it than he does; but she fails, because both of them are so tragically entwined in their fear about the other and about death, and both are so naive in the matter, that she can not keep him him from doing exactly the steps which will lead him to death. As soon as he is alone in Venice he somehow becomes loose; he starts to loose himself to his second sight while still conceiving himself as the loving and caring husband. His misinterpreting of what he sees leads to the fulfilling of the prophecy about him. In the end he even forgets about meeting his wife who is back in Venice, while he is dragged into a strange pursuit of what might seem to him as a memory or reappearance of his dead daughter. He is not anchored in reality anymore but has not yet reached the other world fully like the blind one of the two sisters has. Being in a transit state in between he becomes an easy victim to the unnatural. Only too late he realizes his fatal error and that he had foreseen this creature before as the forerunner of death, being the most ugly twin of his earlier child.Like all films which show present and future mixed into each other this film has to give an answer to the question as to how characters fulfill their prophecy even though their seeing what's going to happen influences what they're doing. In other words: wouldn't they be able to see the future, the future wouldn't be what they see. It's an interesting logical problem and dilemma to films who use this motive. ""Don't look now"" solves it by keeping John Baxter in the dark about his visions so that he finally dies because he doesn't recognize himself, or better: it takes his death to make him see the truth about himself.These are great motives about the human condition and separate this film clearly from being just a horror film. It has more in common with Kubricks ""Eyes wide shut"" in this respect, for example.",Don't Look Now

191,LukeS,The zenith of movie-making,10,17 December 1998,"People want and expect different things from movies. What engages and captivates one person can just as easily displease and repulse another (see Titanic). Sometimes, a film simply doesn't register beyond the viewer's walk/drive home (this criminal offense is not exclusively a phenomenon of the 1990s in spite of the last decade's distinct dearth of memorable films). Don't Look Now, however, is a film which cannot fail to last long in the mind.It is easy to love the film for its rare depth of character, its beautiful yet disturbing plot, the stunning Venice setting, the tender and original love scene or just for Donald Sutherland's never-rivalled wig! I am sure, however, that people find it easy to fault the film because it doesn't neatly tie up loose ends, because it is dark and depressing (the film's extensive reach encompasses death, loss, murder, blindness, religion and dwarfism) and because film-making conventions are abandoned.The source material of Du Maurier's short story provides only a meagre framework onto which screenwriters Scott and Bryant have fleshed a stunning adaptation. Roeg's visual and emotional style of directing has never been so perfectly showcased as in Don't Look Now. How many more times can film-makers and advertisers steal (or ""pay homage to"") Roeg's ingenious work? Julie Christie is luminous and pulls the viewer with her through Laura's painful journey after the film's shocking opening. Sutherland's performance is stellar as well. His character, John, is like a Hitchcockian fall-guy with real personality and depth. You are swept along through the canals and narrow avenues with him as Pino Donaggio's stirring music both chills and lulls.Films made in the tone of Don't Look Now are so rare these days. I am not an old fuddy-duddy who complains that ""they don't make 'em like they used to"" but am simply a slightly disillusioned film fan who wishes there were just a few more film-makers willing to take chances and not follow the dull formulaic line. What was the last film that stayed with you long after you saw it? It always sounds like a cliche when some obsessed fan tells you a film haunted them for days but Don't Look Now has a curious effect on the viewer. Its intensity grows. Different parts of the film mull around in your mind. You don't think about individual 'scenes' from the film either, you think about the situations, the people, the feelings. All of which is testament to the roundly drawn characterisation and elegant (yet not contrived) structure of the film.If you haven't seen Don't Look Now before then you have a treat awaiting you. If you have seen it - see it again and marvel at a profound, eery, haunting, moving and beautiful film. If it disappoints you that films of such indelible and recurring substance like this are thin on the ground (Apocalypse Now, Taxi Driver and The Conversation had similar effects on me) then do not hesitate to picket the next showing of....(OUT OF RESPECT TO IMDB'S CONTENT GUIDELINES I WON'T NAME TITLE OF MORONIC HOLLYWOOD BLOCKBUSTERS AND THE LIKE)!",Don't Look Now

I was used from a young age to watch 'scary' films, but this was in a league of it's own. One of the best performances ever by Donald Sutherland, one which his son Kieffer may never match.Though initially slow to get going the film builds to its climax in a fantastic sequence of events and equally superb shots. The atmosphere builds up steadily and inevitably. It is the ultimate example of the suspense film. The setting enhance the tasteful feel of this production and even the period typical love scene in the hotel, mixing sensual shots of the lead characters making love with shots of them getting dressed and ready to leave afterwards, add real quality and depth to the overall result, whereas the rare moments of predictability and cheesiness do nothing to diminish this feel.An absolute must see for the lover of the classic suspense genre",Don't Look Now

When in Venice, Laura meets two strange sisters, one of them a blind psychic person, who claims that she has seen the couple's daughter. At the end of the movie, you will sit there with your mouth wide open, and just gasp at it.This picture is beautifully directed throughout, and starts with the excellent cross-clipping between Sutherland working and his daughter drowning.

It petrified me as a child, one of the most chilling films I'd seen and I've never been able to look at Angelica Huston in the same way since. Don't Look Now made me feel, as an adult, now with an appreciation of what a good film could do, how I felt as a child.Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie play a couple who end up in Venice for his work, a short while after the untimely and shocking death of their young daughter back at home - an opening scene that immediately draws you in and instantly tells you what sort of film you're about to watch. Their grief lingers in every shot, their relationship convincing and delicate. The cinematography is striking - Venice itself is like another character in this film. And it always keeps you guessing, right up until *that* famous scene near the end where you finally learn the truth behind the fleeting visions of a small hooded figure in that, now iconic, red Mac.I've watched it once since. The same feeling crept over me, that uneasy tingle in the pit of my stomach. It's scary, it's thrilling and at times it's quite romantic.

I was taken by the look and the atmosphere I remember being unnerved but I was appalled by the acting, specially Julie Christie's - one of my favorites of all time. Yesterday I saw the film again in its original English version. My goodness, what a difference! The film is even more frightening that I remembered. The atmosphere is asphyxiating. You can actually smell the rotting stench of the most beautiful city in the world. The ending leaves you breathless and the acting, well, listening to the actors real voices is another experience altogether. The pain and sudden burst of hope in Julie Christie is moving, very moving and very unsettling. Sutherland, as usual, is magnificent.

IF anyone here,commenting on this film ,has not seen Walkabout...it is a MUST,particularly if you are trying to understand the 'multi-levels' of symbolism and thematic material in DLN..Recall the clash of cultures,civilizations in Walkabout, which begins with a suicidal Modern father,determined to kill his children in the Outback..the children survive,rescued by David , the aboriginal teen..Roeg ,utilizing ghostly death scenes, merges ancient and modern psychological human frailties and strengths..as the three adolescents discover each other, their inner resources, will to survive and flourish in an Australian society that had remained segregated and disparate.. Remember, in DLN,we have John Baxter, a rational scientist, apparently assigned to assist in the restoration of an old Venetian church. His premonition regarding the imminent threat to their daughter,Christine's life, occurs as he peers into a magnifier,viewing ,analyzing a slide,possibly, a mosaic fragment from the wall of the church ; recall later the significance of his climbing the scaffolding to match a piece of mosaic into the mural and his almost succumbing to an accident. Of course, he blames himself for not acting earlier to this 'vision', premonition, but offers no 'spiritual', mystical interpretation, unlike his wife,Laura,who dwells in the 'images' of her daughter's spiritual being..And, upon arriving in Venice and meeting the blind sister,Laura is actively seeking to 'communicate' with Christine,and encourages John to open up his steadfast, scientific, rationalist thought stream to their daughter's spirit.. YES, the primary conflict is within John Baxter, the scientist, rationalist, who proclaims our daughter is DEAD, nothing remains..And yet he cannot completely deny the blind sister's observation, that he has the GIFT.. of prophesy, premonition,of foreseeing future events..possibly Christine's imminent death, but guiltily he is powerless to alter her fate, and seemingly his own. What drives John ultimately to pursue the rapidly moving,fading appearance, resembling Christine? Yes, we are left to cope with this enigma. But , if guilt is a universal human attribute, it remains an irrational force that arouses our compelling curiosity, drive to comprehend, and need to obviate.. IS John's 'mysterious' death simply the culmination of his own prophesy..the camera zooms in on the jagged shape of the carotid slit...we have seen it before..several times.. His death,although he defeats several attempts on it, has been prophesied, forewarned by several.But the persistent rationalist remains in Venice,steadfastly to complete his work, but internally dealing with the Blind sister's compelling vision, which she shares ,as a gift, with John..

To believe is to commit intellectual suicide. Better not to look, not to listen. Sutherland and Christie are one of the most convincing modern artistic yet normal married couples in their pain in their every daily detail. Sutherland goes along with Christie's ""nonsense"" because he sees what the nonsense does for her.

So begins a sad tale, where Donald attempts to block this tragedy out of his memory, while his wife (Julie) is reminded of it by a blind psychic (possibly Hilary Mason). The psychic has visions of the young girl, and later, of Sutherland, when she senses he is in danger. Sutherland specializes in restoring old churches. The setting for most of the movie is Venice, Italy, a city that is presented as romantic and haunting. Possibly the best moments of the film are the love scenes between the two leads.

I saw some people say that director purposely was breaking rules of movie making but i don't see it that way. He was using the very rules, the bricks of narrative technique by putting them together in a puzzling way. Editing style of ""Don't look now"" is disorienting and distracting right from the beginning. Lots of mirror images, constant distraction 180 degree action line, unmotivated sounds and so many more is used ingeniously to create the necessary mood. The constant background sound of water makes me feel wet and soaking, you begin to be afraid from sound of water by the end of the movie. The use of water motif in murders and the followed use of it in background sound works perfectly. The beautiful and tourist friendly Venice is given a completely different image. Like a maze where two people loose themselves and each other running after their memories (or running away from them). Another motif used through out the movie was red color. It was almost the only color most of the time on the screen, besides blues of the main characters, all the rest was grayish desaturated look.

The problem is that the movie is so incoherent and (paradoxically) predictable that there is nothing that can be spoiled.I wanted to see an old movie because new ones are too full of gimmicks and tricks trying to artificially scare you. The trick I hate more is to make some characters behave in impossibly stupid ways that puts them in danger trying to make you worry. All cheap films has one or several idiot characters that are killed along the story to make clear how dangerous the situation is. What a lot of people here seems to find innovative, creative, genial, mysterious, thrilling, shocking, shilling, and sinister is that (and here is the spoiler) the idiot is the protagonist.

209,jonathangold2003,Well made but requires explanation,5,29 August 2005,This would have been a very good film but for the total lack of explanation at the end. Who was the freak dwarf at the end? Why does Sutherland see his own funeral before it happens? Why do all of the characters behave so suspiciously? I watched the interviews on the DVD and no explanation was forthcoming. The director waffled on about rationality and coincidence and the fact that they filmed the opening scene in a swimming pool. Who cares? This is undeniably a beautiful and atmospheric film but the storyline is utterly pointless and there are many pointless scenes; for example the famous love scene - one of the most repulsive and unnecessary scenes I have ever had the misfortune of watching - featuring lots of Sutherland's wrinkly butt.Most of this film is a fastforward.,Don't Look Now
210,tsuyoshi-61671,Extremely overrated...a BAD film,2,11 October 2021,"Maybe, the biggest surprise about this film is not the plot itself, but it's reception. I can't believe the number of people praising it and treating it as if it's a masterpiece. It's an extremely flawed film, even if you consider it was made in 1973.I was confused watching the film because the characters acted in an abrupt and weird way no one in real life would ever do. The main characters are supposed to be grieving but you never sense anything from their actions. They just look like a rich couple spending a good time in Italy.And the interactions are so weird. For instance, a woman faints in an overly dramatic way in a restaurant, landing her in a hospital. But in the very same day, she and her husband acts like nothing really happened, smiling and touring through Venice as if the events earlier in the morning never took place. It's just so unrealistic and weird. Things like this happens a lot in this film. I lost count.Not let's talk about the film construction. The film is filled with endless quick shots of Venice it completely messes with the pacing. You'll see quick shots of the skies, water, streets, lights, river... over and over and over again. It's beyond repetitive and pointless. How many times are we gonna have to see a reflection in the river?!The infamous, never ending sex scene itself proves how badly constructed this film actually is. What's the point of having a 10 minute sex scene mixed with quick shots of a woman getting ready in a bathroom?This is a 2 hour film. Why would you waste 10 minutes doing that? Did you really need that amount of sex scene to make whatever point you wanted to make?This film is not a masterpiece. It's a MESS. It's basically a collage of scenes and weird character interactions.",Don't Look Now

Its in no way a horror movie.Off course its a scary movie - the thought of loosing your child is the worst thing that could ever happen to a parent, but in that way Don't Look Now is more a drama than a horror. As a drama it works pretty well but as a horror or psychological thriller its less successful. Using the city of Venice as a setting is a wise choice and its nice the see one of the most romantic cities in the world used for something different than a romantic drama.

I feel that it serves its purpose as a horror film because all of its little elements that find their way deep under your skin don't settle there with ease. The film is like watching a nightmare unfold where you tell yourself 'I'm dreaming' but you don't wake up. Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland are both phenomenal. I think the dramatic portions of the film are heavy and make us care for these sad people enough to be afraid for them.

A married couple enveloped in the unspeakable sadness provoked by the loss of their young daughter. Then, in Venice, among the rot, the beauty and the darkness, a ray of light. But this is not the kind of light that lets you see, no, this light is terrifying because it will persuade you to follow it.

I regard it as the turning point where once-respectable Pauline Kael lost her credibility (she mis-read the whole film and called it ""chic trash"", apparently she was having a flash forward to the Reagan years when every film would have to qualify as ""feel-good""), and everything afterwards seemed like a rerun of its many ideas, and none so deft or generously realized.  After 30 viewings, there is simply nothing I enjoy viewing so much as Roeg's touchstone, whether I watch it as a psychological grief study, a treatise on synchronicity, a meditation on perception, or a sly, darkly humorous Gothic yarn having its awful fun with the predicament of a middle class married couple stranded in wintry Venice.It is not a film for those who merely ""watch"" film like passive snails, or kids who think a good edit is a John Woo sequence.

218,alison-jasonides,"Not Just a ""Horror"" Flick: A Testament to 1970s Film Craft",8,28 October 2011,"Few directors create the degree of tension that Nicholas Roeg does in ""Don't Look Know"" purely by prolonging the pace of his story-telling and drawing the ""eye's"" attention on seemingly innocuous images of supposedly inanimate objects: an ornate door, a crumbling wall with peeling paint, sheet-covered furniture sitting in an empty room, a ring on a finger. It is this pace at which the viewer is shown these objects that allows us to understand there is an ambiguous importance to these things. The animist treatment of the main protagonist, the city of Venice, and of all the objects that make her up, create an eerie sense that all things have a soul and sight and significance and, as a result, that all moments mean something and are pre-ordained and fated. It is this materialism that stands above the human characters of this story. After all, the viewer begins to understand early on that the various characters' pre-mature deaths are already fated and foretold, and that it's only a matter of time before the characters understand this (save for the blind sister-- and too late at that). ""Don't Look Now"" is a thing of beauty, a must for anyone in love with the visual styles of the '70s, with the singular tone of movies made in Italy in that decade, and with a detailed attention and love for a soundtrack, cinematography and production that would be much more at home in a movie that does not call itself ""horror.""",Don't Look Now

The leads, Julie Christie, with her original beauty, and the reliably interesting Donald Sutherland, are vividly believable as husband and wife, and their monumental grief is never cloying or sentimental, never overplayed. The blind clairvoyant and her companion provide a fine balance of the sinister and the innocent, with the rest of the cast maintaining the high standard. Many films with touches of the supernatural quickly become mired in flakiness, whereas this film effectively opens your mind to many possible interpretations.Venice is the other major star, its majestic decadence perfectly caught in mostly muted tones, without the film ever looking like a travelogue. The almost unnavigable streets (even locals admit they can still get lost) are brilliantly used to heighten the suspense; the Venetian art and architecture adds resonance at every turn; and, of course, the water...Although the plot on occasion seems as convoluted as the Venetian street plan, like the streets it can be followed if sufficient concentration is paid.Like most great art, thinking only whatever the auteur was thinking is not the point, even though understanding what they are trying to do usually adds to the pleasure.One of the great joys of Venice is rowing for yourself around its marvelous canals; much better than being taken in a gondola.

Apparently in the hope of infusing the film with an atmosphere of dread, the director has inserted moments of complete nonsense into this film which completely detract from the wonderful performances of the two lead actors. For instance, at one point we see the two sisters, one of whom is psychic, laughing in an evil, maniacal fashion as is they are plotting the downfall of the two lead characters. As it turns out, they are actually sweet women with no malice towards the grieving couple. Why the evil, maniacal laughter? Ask the director.

On the final report I was writing things like 'twists and turns the audience so many different ways', 'pulsating' and 'return of the classic horror film'.To be honest the film did lack some direction in the middle with no definite plot, no definite thing to grab hold of. It seemed to sail along like one of those boats on the Venice canal without exciting me or without, to be honest, SERIOUSLY boring me. I sat in hope of the next scene blasting into life but carried on disappointed.The ending certainly did blast into life, but for the sake of avoiding a spoiler, I'll just say it took me two or three minutes after thinking it over to get my head round what had happened and why.Only when you look back on this film do u realise how good and clever it is, the editing being a HUGE factor into making it what it is.

The new released copy will be soon at the cinemas.,10,2 July 2011,"I was lucky enough to be at the Curzon Soho for the world premier (what a big word) of the new copy of this British masterpiece. I don't want to say much about the story. The ones in the know haven't forgotten it since its first release, and the others will find enough information on the net. I saw the film for the first time in the late 70's, I think. Some of the pictures from the scenes in Venice are still in my mind today. That says a lot for me about the great cinematography, the locations, the brilliant directing, the excellent screenplay, and, last but not least, the wonderful acting of all the actors involved. One can't imagine anymore that somebody else than Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland could have played the couple who had lost their daughter. Both made one of the very best films of their career. This is also thanks to Roeg, of course, who has, as he told us, his own way to include the spur of the moment and whatever will happen on and off the set in a creative way. Thus the movie, a piece of art in this case, can take on its own life. This reminds me a lot of musical improvisers, certain painters and other artists, especially the really good ones, I have to add. When I found out that Nicolas Roeg and his writer Allan Scott would attend the new release screening I had immediately to get a ticket. When does one have the chance to see Nic Roeg in public and even to ask him questions? In the early days of his career he worked, for example, with David Lean. Since then he has become one of the great masters himself, with a number of masterpieces under his belt. The film critic who shared the discussion mentioned six masterpieces Roeg has done in a row. Don't Look Now being one of them. According to the critic this is unparalleled in film history, and they are all very much worth seeing. Apart from the hairstyles, as Allan Scott said, the film still looks surprisingly fresh. And I have to agree with him.

This film is certainly a good example, and, to its credit, it does actually manage to create an eerie mood. Their enjoyment is largely based on an intellectual appreciation of it.

In other words they love the drama.The other team, The Frustrated, have had their expectations of this film thwarted. They have most likely seen the high IMDb score or have heard good things about it. They watch and are frustrated by its lack of a driving narrative and the lack of a rounded payoff, especially considering it's nearly 2 hours long. Further infuriated is felt because of their opposition the Art Rebels, who are responsible for bigging it up and directly to blame for the boredom felt. The Frustrated too love the drama of battle and will rate the film lower than they actually feel about it.I have given it a rating of 5/10, which was actually only to give the impression that I'm impartial. My real rating is 3/10. This film lacked crucial direction. It does create a mood, it does have bits of engaging scenes and dialogue, and it does create something of a buildup at the start, but my goodness, the hopeful setup turns into a plot less, confused fog and any momentum already created soon plummets into a painful, painful boredom.

Nicholas Roeg's inimitable style of editing disjointed flash forwards and flashbacks to tell a story are employed here to tell a tale of the effects of grief and the rebirth of hope on a couple after the tragic loss of a child. The viewer is not subtly bludgeoned with recurring motifs of water, the color red, falling, and claustrophobic scenes, many of which are overly stylized and pointless. The decay and rot of Venice are used to good effect. The plot revolves around psychic foreshadowing of events, until the ""shocking"" reveal at the end. The movie has been described variously as a thriller, a suspense, a psychological study, and a horror film, but doesn't really deliver any of this very well. I found it to be shallow and unconvincing. In one scene that involves a fall, and subsequently an object falling in slow motion towards Donald Sutherland's character, I kept hoping that he would end up like the unfortunate Father Brennan in the 1976 version of ""The Omen"" where the priest gets impaled by a lightning rod falling from the top of a church, but unfortunately he lives, and the film goes on. If you look up the etymology of the exclamation ""meh"", you'll likely find that it began as a description of this movie. And despite some clever uses of the color red as a repetitive motif, it has the absolute worse use of theatrical blood I've ever seen, kind of cotton candy pink.

Like the novella of the same name, the film demands multiple viewings to fully comprehend. The themes are vast and touch most with sentiment and appreciation of art. I myself do not have a biased opinion about the superiority of film over the written word as I appreciate both and view both mediums as homage-like compliments to each other. Without literature film could not exist. Still, when I recollect experiencing both art forms of Don't Look Now, it is somewhat easy for me to conclude that the film touches a nerve in my being that the novella did not strike. This is not a condemnation of the novella, but this film is one of a rare kind as it has such power in its complexity and attention to detail that viewing it is a intensely involving quest for the psyche, that questions grief, the afterlife, Christianity, romance and the unanswered questions about extrasensory perception. That perception is shown by a man, the director Sir Nicolas Roeg, with unrivaled clarity of vision, while capturing the essence of the story. As I sit here writing and listening to the hauntingly beautiful soundtrack of this film it brings back the startling and incomparable images of the film that never leave one after they have seen the thrilling Gothic film. I remember the night I first saw it on a big theater screen for my editing class and I'd never heard of the movie or director, but chills were sent down my spine and I was afraid to walk alone to my car through the dark, looming parking lot of unknown terror. I believe the movie has much more redeeming value and it is no shock that it is the more acclaimed and popular of the two versions. This is a fitting task for me to expose the fallacy that novels are always better than the film version because I am passionate about literature and film. I long to be involved in the film industry some day, but for now I am using the case of Don't Look Now to expose this fallacy using my sources pertaining to the novella, film and film adaptation theory. 
At first, when choosing my topic I thought Film Adaptation would be a daunting task because the sources I had been intending to use were in depth, dense, and I thought back to an optional paper I could have done on Don't Look Now back in my days at Pasadena City College, which was after the first time I viewed the film and immediately it resonated with me as a unforgettable film of such depth that it just went right over my head. I could not write on the lone topic of the uses of the color red in the film at that time, but now as I look at that task it would be far too easy. The effect was so profound on me, that I immediately ordered the film on VHS as it was not yet on DVD at the time and even though it is now, it is in the barebones format with no special features, which is a mockery to a film of such greatness that warrants a much more prestigious offering that presents the work of art in a respectable package. The paper I was assigned was optional which was to explore the motif of the color red in the film, I felt I was not quite ready for as the meaning of it was elusive to me, but now I am ready to explore most of the prominent themes in the novella and the film as I have had the time to absorb both and I have the vehemence to do both of these works of art the justice and well-deserved analysis they both warrant.
Adapting films is a difficult task especially when dealing with lengthy novels or when the primary source is convoluted, complex, and ambivalent and open to many interpretations. Films are a cooperative effort by a collection of minds, but in some cases like mine, an auteur (French term for author) is in control of the vision of the complete film including aspects like casting, editing, cinematography, and input on the screenplay. Nicolas Roeg the director of the film I am examining is a former cinematographer, and editor. Thus, Don't Look Now, is Nicolas Roeg's interpretation of Daphne Du Maurier's novella of the same name. The medium of novella is ideal for film as Stuart McDougal states in opposition to a source from a play, because ""Film shares more methods of storytelling with the novel and short story"" (4).
The main problem with adapting a literary source is deciding what to leave in and what to leave out. Words cannot always describe what is to be shown on the screen and what is on the screen does not, in essence, automatically reflect those exact words. This reminds me so much of the difference between the sign and signifier in that both need each other to explain what that concept is as a whole. A symbol does not contain an essence, but is assigned a word by an arbitrary convention or the ruling ideology. Through practice the symbol stands for what it signifies which are what such theorist as Ferdinand de Saussure outlined. But, used alongside one another they can express the same mood, tone, characterizations, themes, and even expand on them or imply other symbols. Everyone's interpretation is different of a novel as it is with a film, but a film manipulates and dictates exact visions and reflects one person's view of a story. In the case of Nic Roeg's work he is a perfectionist auteur who takes advantage of the tools of film to use its limitless spatial and temporal possibilities to expand a drama. Roeg also takes full advantage of his power to manipulate an audience as McDougal states that nowadays ""a director has the means to focus our attention on minute details (through close-ups, zooms), suggest relationships (through editing), and present thoughts (through editing, point-of-view shots, composition, and the use of color) (4). 
Every art form has distinctive properties, so when making a film decisions have to be made on what to include in the interpretation. What works in a novel does not necessarily work in a film, but in my case study many of the techniques in the novella work in the film, as the novella is the closest to a perfect written medium for transformation into film. Still, many changes were made in my film examination and most of them for the better. Stuart McDougal aptly defines these decisions as contraction. He explains the usual process of contraction stating that ""novels are contracted when filmed through the deletion of characters and incidents"" (4).
There are many other decisions a director makes in preproduction that can influence the viewer's interpretation or expectations in a film. Casting is important because an audience may have a preconceived notion of certain actors and actresses. Don't Look Now, almost collapsed immediately as a project because Donald Sutherland was not available at the time and Nic Roeg was close to shelving the film until he was available, but by fate, he was freed from his prior obligations. Both Julie Christie and Donald Sutherland are both well-respected actors, but not movie stars like Jack Nicholson or another star who always seems to just play themselves. They transform into the characters they play, the grieving, bickering, but yet romantic couple of John and Laura Baxter. It is also important to point out that Nicolas Roeg chose someone without an English accent to play John Baxter, which differs from the short story and I feel adds a further effect making him seem like an outsider who would be even less capable at speaking Italian than an Englishman.
Literature and film have a binary relationship and rely on each other, not in the typical theoretical way as they are not opposites at all, but film is the progression of all arts. Film is a relatively new art form and so has a negative connotation as being unproven as a true respectable art form. Literature has the opposite connotation and is one of the oldest art forms, and without it film could not exist. Film is deeply indebted to Literature as it exists in the written form of a screenplay and uses text in the credits and as symbolic motifs like books that are lying around in the frame and the scene in the beginning where Laura Baxter uses an encyclopedia to answer a question her daughter asks how a lake can freeze and be flat if the world is round? John Baxter says a line in response, which is a theme of the film ""Nothing is what it seems"". The book in the opening scene on the nightstand is titled ""Beyond the Geometry of Space"" and it is no coincidence that it is glimpsed in the frame as Nicolas Roeg distorts and manipulates our view of space and time with elaborate editing techniques and cinematography. The book I believe is not a 'real' book, but there are many that exist with similar titles and discuss the same concepts like quantum physics, time travel, and the structure of space. Just like this book while watching the film , we jump back and forth through time and journey through Venice's eerie crevices of space. Literature contributes so much to film as it provides ""models of plot, character, and ways of presenting thought processes"" (McDougal 3).
This point about Literature being complimentary to film brings my mind back to a film teacher I had at Pasadena City College who was the direct opposite of me. He was a tool and my film friend in the class agreed. I liked Nicolas Roeg, and he liked Michael Bay. He had a dorky flat-top and I had long hair. These differences between us resonated when I turned in a short film which everyone in the class thought was intense and powerful, but he picked on me for flashing images of Philosophy books for symbolism and called the use of the written word, weak and not visual. Now I grin with content as I see many of my favorite film directors use this same technique to a great effect and I used the same technique without being full aware that it was modeled for me byfor me..",Don't Look Now

To start the magnificent beauty of Venice, and secondly to complement it, the presence and elegance of Julie Christie, in my point one of the best movie stars of all times.At the same level, we can say, the performance of D.

Good scenes, good cinematography and good acting were all to be appreciated. Even though Venice is one of the safest cities in the world, the crimes shown in the movie did not seem artificial at all. The decadence of the city was surprisingly natural and in fact totally fit into the old-""to-be-restored"" atmosphere of Venice. However, in the end, thanks to the dwarf, everything was spoiled and thrown to the garbage. I could not help but laughing looking at the fake blood going out of the neck of the guy and meaninglessly shaking head of the dwarf. Such a delusion.",Don't Look Now

I also thought the cinematography was well-done. Not too many downsides to the film. LOL Even the Blair Witch type ending would have worked if only the character had been revealed as less grotesque, which was just too much. It seemed sort of anti-semitic, how that role was cast. But that's certainly arguable. Great film, nonetheless, especially considering that it is a film from the 70's, and many films from that era have dated badly, whereas this one hasn't hardly at all.

For another thing, the plot itself makes no sense. It basically concerns two people whose daughter drowns; they move to Venice for no apparent reason, and then scary stuff starts to happen. Oh, wait. No it doesn't. This movie isn't scary at all. The only scene worth mentioning is the sex scene, which contains enough nudity to offend anyone with a sense of decency, but not enough to impress people who want to see that sort of thing.I'm not going to spoil the ending for you, but after the movie dragged along for 2 hours, let's just say I was EXTREMELY disappointed.This movie should have been called Don't Watch Now.

I cant imaging that 30 years ago, and in the big screen it could really take your breath. The decision to choose Venice as the background, is super. The characters move in this dark and small streets like in an enhanced town with lot of strange, fascinating and disturbing elements.

However there is a creepy and ominous theme as the film progresses and a sense of not being able to trust any of the people that the main character meets.With all of this build up you expect something to happen that's going to flip this film on its head and really make you think but no such luck with the ending of the film being just as pointless and mediocre as the rest of it.I will point out that the film is over 40 years old and maybe it worked when it was released in that time period but for me it was a waste of time and i would honestly not recommend it to anyone.",Don't Look Now
250,God_Guns_and_Country,Don't Look Now (1973)- a beautifully shattering film,10,17 February 2006,"N.B. I Post the spoiler alert, because I discuss general details of the ending, and it is hard to talk about it without describing it. I will try to be general, for anyone reading this for research purposes, without giving away too much. A beautiful, picturesque film. I just about think this film is faultless. Each frame of the 105 minutes has perfect attention to detail. If you've been unaware of this film up to now, stop reading this review and see it - nothing will prepare you for the ending, and you'll get much more enjoyment if you have no idea of what's coming next. There are three main scenes, which critics usually pull out from the film. The opening scene, certainly is well made, and conveys a very British approach, in the house and its architecture. British audiences should find very much that this will relate to them. And then when Christine dies, Donald Sutherland's performance is incredible! The second notable scene is the Love scene - and it is a love scene and not a sex scene. The couple capture an intimate relationship, which conveys more passion than most sex scenes. The realism in which it is filmed also makes audience feel like a voyeur to the extent that it is such an intimate scene. Its also so important as it is the first time Laura Baxter was able to touch her husband since Christine's death. The characters are played brilliantly by their respective stars. Donald Sutherland becomes the English architect in a foreign city perfectly, and Julie Christie deserves an Oscar for her performance. Many didn't like the film on its release, because they associated Christie with the more mainstream 'Dr Zhivago', but in my opinion, the role here is far more complex and intricate, and therefore the better film. The ending is truly one of the greatest in film history. You'll want to watch it over and over, to see all the levels of meaning. Even those realists who believe the dwarf woman is only the serial killer who'se victims have been in the backdrop throughout the film, will find it intriguing, because serial killers are usually tall dominating males. The thought of being killed by an old dwarf lady in a red coat challenges our schema, and that is what conveys wider meanings. My own interpretation is that the woman represents death. In Folklore death wears a hood after all, and although I'm not great on historical contexts, I believe that there was a plague on Venice in the 16th Century or there abouts, which religious society called the red death. The Red Colour schemes define this film as art, and the piano music will haunt you. If you enjoyed this it might be worth seeing:1) The Human Stain- Anthony Hopkins et al,- a very similar tone, and very repressed characters.2)Masque of the Red Death- Vincent Price et al, - Not as complex as DLN, but a good use of historical contextualisation and the representation of death3) The Life Of David Gale - Okay, this is a little different, but the slowish pace, and wider messages are likely to appeal to a similar audience. Thanks for reading this review. I hope it was useful, in helping you make up your own interpretation of this masterpiece.",Don't Look Now
251,hamecrit97,The setting was beautiful,4,15 July 2005,"The leads were both very skinny, very young, and very rosy. The love scene was very explicit and beautifully done. However the movie is dated. There was no depth. I never could figure how many children they did have and why these children were left behind? We know that a very young boy was in boarding school but what happened to the older sister. They were like backdrops. The filming was wonderful, Venice was magnificent but the plot was lacking and very much a shallow Henry James. The plot was not knitted together. At one point, Sutherland says, "" I've been here before."" I guess that actually was a premonition but it was never addressed again. That happened frequently in the movie.

Which can be totally ok, but not when the main story is so unclear as in this case or when the motivation of the characters can not be connected to their actions. You are constantly wondering why the people do what they are doing. And then at the end, you have a surprise. Ok, fine, but why like this? Why did it happen and why the dwarf? Did not see it before, no one mentioned it earlier. Is this a punishment? Is it random?The movie does leave you wondering, but not in a good way.O, and it wasn't scary at any level at all.

256,philster,Oi! Big Nose!,1,29 December 2004,"Don’t Look Now is horrifically dull. The dialogue is tortuous, with long, drawn out scenes between the two leads that seem to have little point or direction. Whilst the quality of the film is greatly enhanced by the digital remastering, the soundtrack fares rather poorly in comparison and so to make matters worse, the piece is filled with a screeching score and shrill dialogue that is rather akin to listening to somebody running a metal glove down a blackboard. Emotionally, I could make no attachment to the film’s characters, whatsoever. The initial tragedy of Christine’s death occurs and is then swept aside as the action shifts to Venice almost without feeling or note. We have no concept of how much time has transpired, so we have no real indication of how much time has passed that might have healed the mental wounds. Both John and Laura seem unaffected, despite the fact that Laura’s mood subsequently lifts when some supernatural contact appears to have been made with her dead daughter. John seems detached and, frankly, rather disinterested and this is a state of emotion that quickly rubs off on the audience.The trouble with the long scenes of dialogue is that you find yourself looking for a hidden meaning that ultimately doesn’t exist. One of the film’s most famous (or should that be infamous?) scenes is a sex scene between the two leads, Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie. Film history tells us that the film was allegedly after an initial version had been made because the director felt that the couple were spending too much time on screen arguing. You can certainly tell that the film was something of an afterthought. I have certainly never seen a clumsier, and less sexy sex scene in my life, despite its rather explicit content. As Sutherland and Christie writhed and pumped I could only really liken the whole experience to that moment when Ken and Dierdre had a bit of a snog on Coronation Street. Gross.It’s worth noting that not an awful lot happens in this film. It’s a film based on suggestion and imagery. The director is intent on injecting the colour red throughout the film. Initially, John knocks over a bottle of bright red ink onto a camera slide that seems to signify the death of his daughter who drowns in a bright red rain coat. From there on in, the red is everywhere – in the crowds, in the cafes, and in virtually every scene involving Sutherland or Christie. Its significance is either utterly obvious or fiendishly subtle, but in either case dreadfully uninteresting. Even the apparent beauty of Venice is lost upon the dull script that wends its way through the drawn out film like a dead body floating along the canals.Sutherland looks extremely odd in this film as he has done in every other film he has ever made, to be perfectly honest. This certainly helps. His glaring eyes and frightened expressions certainly do their best to draw the audience in, even if they have already either nodded off or left the room. Julie Christie is frightfully frightful and tries just as hard, but points never were awarded for effort and her input is soon lost. The only rather interesting character is that of the blind sister, who looks and sounds rather sinister throughout and will certainly provide opportunity for cataract-inspired nightmares in young and old alike.Don’t Look Now strikes me as a film that has aged rather poorly. Interestingly enough, there were many things in this film that reminded me of The Exorcist, a film that was also released in 1973. Both films have the same dark, lifeless tone. Both films contain priests that seem to know more than they’re letting on and both films feature lots of religious imagery. In some ways, the conclusion to both films also feels rather similar. As a horror film, The Exorcist is infinitely more successful. Even now, the film is terrifying to the core and holds its own against modern-day counterparts. Indeed, if you’re looking for scares, then I would suggest you look elsewhere – Don’t Look Now’s 15-certificate is more likely to have been awarded based on its sexual content than any real horror.There are many who will disagree with me, but Don’t Look Now bored the pants off me. This is not what I call a classic film. It’s what I call boring old dirge. Don’t Look Now? Don’t Look Ever, would be my advice.",Don't Look Now

262,Torcello1,A great film from one of the greatest periods of American film-making,10,16 December 2008,"It is sad to read some of the derogatory reviews on here of this film. You may not like it, but it is hard to deny its brilliance. I saw this movie upon its original release in 1973, and many times since. The elegant beauty of the cinematography, the intense but sometimes unnoticed soundtrack, and the entire mood of the film is extraordinary. Perhaps to a young viewer 35 years later, it may not have enough action or violence to sustain viewing, but then that is assuming that this is a 'horror' film, and ignoring the poetic mystery which pervades every scene. There was a lot of violence in films from this time period, but it more often than not was secondary to the larger story. No easy explanations, no resolutions. The stupid (to me) comments about a seeing a red dwarf in Venice makes me wonder if the writer has ever been to Venice - lost at night in the dark. I doubt it. The love scene between Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie is amazing and was a big deal at the time. It definitely was groundbreaking in its backward/forward time depiction, which only added to the perceived truth of it. It seems the criticisms on here concerning that are that it was too long or too intense! Is that what contemporary film-goers are reduced to? Puritanical abhorrence of a natural, casual, yet intense and real moment? It was the crux of the film, entwining the past and the present and future - a bridge between the first half and the ending - and such a truthful sort of depiction of how passions can be reignited on a journey to such a place as Venice.

Believe me, I wanted to love the film for its impressive style and atmosphere, but unfortunately, that alone can't compensate for the ineptitude of its plot that started out as enigmatic but ended up as pure horse sheet. John and Laura lost their daughter in a drowning accident. Some time later, they went to Venice for a job that John is contracted with. While eating at a restaurant, Laura met two old sisters (one is psychic but blind) who claimed that they can see the ghost of their daughter. Laura believed them. John did not. (INSERT : LENGTHY SEX SCENE)Meanwhile, John is being troubled by apparitions. The two old sisters warned Laura that John's life is in danger. He kept on seeing a red caped girl who resembles the image of her daughter at a dark alley. Later on, Laura flies back to England to check on his other kid. The same day, John thought he saw Laura with the two sisters riding an adorned boat. He was worried. Apparently, there's a killer on the loose. He then consulted the police. The two old sisters were brought in for questioning. They were released briefly after John confirmed that Laura is where she's supposed to be. Laura returns to Venice. John, after taking the other blind sister home, saw the red caped girl and followed her at a deserted building. It turns out that she's not their dead daughter. She's an ugly dwarf who's on a murder spree. Upon confrontation, she slits John's throat. They had a procession by the river. The end. I read somewhere that the movie is filled with symbols and subtexts, and that it's about dealing with grief and premonitions, but the problem for me is the story as a whole is not powerful nor interesting enough to be given two sheets about. The worst part of it all is that it didn't even scare me once! It's a goddarn horror movie! While I do appreciate the oftentimes eerie mood and the enigmatic Venice setting, it didn't amount to anything that's gonna cut through the bone. And let's not talk about that ending. That might be the most atrocious joke that I have ever seen in my entire life. I'm sorry, but I'm just not gonna get scared by an old ugly dwarf, even one who has a butcher knife in its hand.",Don't Look Now
265,erikrichterstrand,Simply magical,10,6 August 2004,"The power and beauty of ""Don't Look Now"" still baffles me after countless viewings. The film's legendary opening sequence alone signals a work of extraordinary quality. The performances by Sutherland and Christie are both puzzling in their ""something-is-very-wrong"" ambiguity and, at the same time, haunting in their simplistic honesty. The film's sex-scene shows which moving results may come from actors who trust each other and their inspired director, all at the peaks of their talents. The film is also an interesting document of the seventies' styles and film-making techniques. ""Don't Look Now"" is a modern masterpiece, truly different and more intelligent than any other horror film you're likely to see. It inspired me to become a filmmaker when I saw it at fifteen. Don't miss it.",Don't Look Now
266,SeverynKain,"Beautiful Venice, Awful Horror Movie.",2,28 July 2012,"I am incredibly shocked that this movie received a 7.5 rating!!I'm sure I've seen over 2,000 films in my lifetime and just about every horror movie ever made. If people have given this film a high rating simply for the fact that it is torture just to sit and watch I'd be pleased to follow suit and give it a 10 rating. I would not give this film more than a 2-star rating(and I'm being generous). This is 1 hour and 45 minutes I'll never get back.I also believe that this movie should be moved into the drama category and not horror, or even thriller for that matter. If you are interested in viewing this film prepare yourself for a very slow-moving drama in which you find yourself starting to look at the clock around the 30 minute mark and saying to yourself 'hmmm...I wonder when the movie will begin', then at the 45-minute point, and again after an hour while scratching your head and saying: 'this is a horror movie? In my opinion this movie got entered into the horror genre simply due to the end sequence (which lasts only a few minutes). Don't expect too many jumps, creepy atmosphere, gore or psychological terror.Good points about the movie: - Very beautiful scenery of Venice, Italy.",Don't Look Now
267,mirkatty,one of the most beautiful and terrifying films of all time,9,2 July 2006,"The city of Venice is the 3rd co-star of this gorgeous thriller. You can almost smell the nasty canal water and the mildewed bottoms of the buildings. Sutherland plays an architect helping to restore an ancient church. There are so many crumbling antiquities in Italy, restoration is always going on, and this church is very Gothic and suggestive of weirdness. The bishop is an enigmatic figure. Most scary movies feature lots of gore but not this one, its subtle. One is constantly being kept off balance, slightly suggestive of Hitchcock. The cinematography is exquisite and erotic as are Sutherland and Christie. Roeg started his film career as a cinematographer and I think this is a great example. Daphne DuMaurier has scared a lot of people and i'm one. Don't watch this alone!",Don't Look Now
268,Stuntrocker,the seventies ruled,10,20 December 2004,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS What more would you want from a film, you've got Donald Sutherland, the immaculate Julie Christie, ESP, Venice, a red dwarf?, old blind eroticism, the most sensual love scene ever filmed,and wonderful sound editing creating a haunting, visceral horror film! I saw this movie at the Paramount theater in Austin with a double feature of Night Of The Hunter and I was blown away by the look and feel of both films.Nicholas Roeg is a genius who is vastly underrated and unfortunately underworked. Maybe someday people will regard him in the same breath as a Kubrick or Lynch when they look back at his films of the seventies including Walkabout and The Man Who Fell To Earth.God Bless Nicholas Roeg!",Don't Look Now
269,webvideo-858-636084,A 1970's supernatural thriller / Art film,8,30 November 2013,"Nic Roeg's evocative thriller still stands up pretty well after all these years. Released in 1973 it was amongst a number of films that broke new ground in dragging 'horror' away from the camp clichés of Hammer etc.The subtle performances of Christie and Sutherland and the delicious lingering direction of the misty winter'd city, which makes Venice the other leading character, set the film above the common thriller and into the realms of 'the art film'. Now this can obviously put off viewers who are looking for a more 'straight ahead' movie experience, but for those who are looking for a more sophisticated experience, 'Don't look now' delivers.Definitely a film from a European tradition rather than Hollywood, the movie uses a filmic language beautifully to express and explore the characters and the situation (providing us with clues, emotions and puzzles to keep us guessing), rather than dialogue to fully explain and tell the audience what to think.The events are taking place some months after the death of their child and Christie and Southerland excellently portray a couple teetering between crisis and denial; hanging on to each other desperately one moment, sinking into their work for distraction the next, arguing the next, taking medication, not taking medication, jumping at hopes of 'life after death' and so on.There are beautifully crafted 'red-herrings' along the way to keep you guessing and the supporting characters (such as the priest) are not spoon-fed to the audience as either good or bad but as elements of the mystery that we may or may not be seeing through the lens of the Baxter's eyes.The final scenes explores the many threads and (especially for a first time viewer) have a superb conclusion which successfully avoids sliding into a trite b-movie ending that simply 'wraps everything up'.In short, this a 1973 movie and as such is obviously a product of its time but if you like a more European style of cinema and would like to see an early supernatural thriller deftly handled by cast and crew, this is it.Oh yes - I forgot to say, it's got what I still consider to be one of the best love scenes in any movie before or since.",Don't Look Now
270,jsperrott1,Means to an End,8,25 January 2014,"If your looking for an accessible, decently paced film, one that will keep you engaged with a constantly flowing eventful narrative then stay away. If your in a more open-minded mood and appreciative of the art of horror/suspense cinema give this one a go and it just may be that rare gem you stumble upon and cant get off your mind for the next few weeks.Nothing particularly interesting, thrilling or scary happens for the majority of the film. In fact on the surface it is just a portrayal of two parents in grief over their dead daughter, trying to get to grips with it and slowly move on with their lives. However what becomes apparent once they arrive in Venice is an eerie foreboding presence that seems to follow the protagonists (in particular Sutherland) around the city. The tone of repressed grief, and the atmosphere of an impending doom of ""something"" steadily grows until you can almost see it in the air. Id really prefer not to talk about the climax as the less you expect, the better. But i will say that the rather uneventful, but unsettingly atmospheric first part of the film affects the impact of the ending in a way that no conventional, steadily paced horror film could ever achieve. Very much a ""means to an end"" experience, in a way I've never experienced on film, and why this a must-watch for any real fans of horror, suspense or mystery, in my opinion.Watch in a dark room at night, its one of those.",Don't Look Now

272,e5capeveloc1ty,I wish I'd followed the title's advice.,1,24 March 2015,"Over the years The Criterion Collection has restored and presented many of cinema's greatest treasures. Thanks to their meticulous care, thousands of the film world's greatest achievements have gotten the care and attention they so richly deserve. On the other hand, they've also reissued stuff like Don't Look Now.This movie is almost universally beloved by critics and Serious Film Viewers. When I was a film student, if they'd showed this to us I'm sure I would have gone right along with the party line and proclaimed this to be a masterpiece. But I was so much older then; I'm younger than that now. I don't have to call something profound because it's slow. I can call it yawn-inducing and poorly paced.The basic plot here is that John and Laura lost their little girl Christine to a drowning and now they're in Venice while John helps with a church restoration. One day Laura meets two sisters, one of whom - - a blind woman with second sight -- says she can see Christine sitting with John and Laura, and that the daughter is happy. She also says Christine bears a warning for her parents: leave Venice at once. John doesn't believe it and he stays, much to his detriment.Now, I could attempt to expand on that synopsis but there would be no point because there is no further plot, unless you count John's endless meandering through foggy alleyways. Does cinematographer Anthony Richmond make empty Venice look great in the film? Absolutely. Does the occasional splash of the color red on Christine's raincoat and blood on a photographic slide have a striking effect when it appears? Sure it does. Is there a famous sex scene between Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie? Apparently, but unless you're into watching two bony skeletons clack together, it's not going to do much for you.Roger Ebert once said, ""It is the film's visual style, acting, and mood that evoke its uncanny power"" and his sentiment is echoed by a lot of other reviews I've read about this movie. But without a decent script, it's simply style over substance. This film has a reputation for being terrifying, or at the very least chilling. I adore films with those descriptors but this never even came close. As always, I can only speak for my own personal experience and would never discount anyone else's opinions on art. Aside from the decent cinematography and a tremendous performance by Donald Sutherland's mustache, this film really failed for me on every other level.",Don't Look Now
273,BLacqWyng,An absolute masterpiece in suspense,10,12 June 2005,"DLN is in my humble opinion one of the best horror/suspense movies ever, the eerie gloomy atmosphere of the almost desolated city of Venice in wintertime reminds me somewhat of the atmosphere one feels in the Shining's empty halls and corridors of the Outlook hotel (the latter then being a very weak copy of the original, I even suspect King wrote the book after he saw DLN, Kubrick sure must have). The couple Sutherland and Christie are still struggling with their recent loss and are slowly drawn into disaster like moths to a flame. Christie almost seems to be hypnotized by the two strange sisters and Sutherland slowly slides into a twilight zone between reality and nightmare, hope and despair. The often spoken of love/sex scene only adds to the chilling sad and foreboding atmosphere as a counterpoint to the tension between the couple in most other scenes.",Don't Look Now
274,selinda123,I'm at a loss...,2,18 July 2018,"This movie makes no sense. There is no story. No explanation. No plot. It's 2 hours of nothing and then a cheesy ending. Other than an unneeded sex scene, there is no contact or emotional tie between any of the characters. Very cold and disjointed.

275,flaherty-51812,Yuck,1,18 April 2015,"I was in the mood for a solid psychological thriller. I love a good scare, minus the blood and guts. I looked at different lists of recommended scary movies and came across this. I gave it a try. Really really ewwwwww. I hated this movie but clearly ""intellectuals"" loved it. The handsome priest could have had Satan himself exploding from all of his orifices, but it would have been the secondary plot. Early on in this movie (which I did not know) is a supposedly well known, very long sex scene. Wish I had know that before I downloaded this. I wanted scary, not gross out. I have never been a huge fan of Donald Sutherland, so to be repeatedly exposed to this naked, skinny, disturbingly tall, permed, pale guy was more than uncomfortable. This is a thriller??!! He's got this fro/perm thing so he looks eight feel tall then he's naked all over the place. We see all of Donald Sutherland, over and over. Yuck. It was so uncomfortable. I wanted to get to the ""scary"" part of this movie but finally gave up with 45 minutes left. Nothing but naked Donald had been presented (and did I say WAAAY to much presented)and no matter what happened I just could not scrub that image. Just gross. Hardly the thriller I had hoped. I can not say how high up on the yuck factor this movie reached. Was there a plot or story here? I have no idea. I need to go sterilize my eyes.",Don't Look Now
276,misosoric,Very superficial,6,3 January 2016,"I can see why this film may be a hit among fans but personally I found it very superficial. Why is that? Because the film has a very good atmosphere, especially in the first third of the movie but that atmosphere turns out to be it's own purpose. Director creates a diversion by trying to persuade us that the stories within the film are closely related yet they turn out to be very much unrelated.I love the cinematography and the style in which the movie was shot but it fails with dramaturgy. It seems as if the movie was composed of many psychologically tense moments without anything that composes and connects them into a one solid structure. The red thread of the movie is non existent. The director wanted to make their dead daughter the red thread. He wanted to make it something to bind all the parts of the movie and to lead us to believe that everything will fall into place at the end but the end is completely disappointing and fails in that attempt. I don't know if ""fails"" is the right term to describe it considering it was never his intention to make relation from the beginning of the movie with it's ending in the first place. And that make me felt like I was cheated. Donald Sutherland as the main character was very good but I wasn't too thrilled by his partner Julie Christie. I just didn't trust her completely. Overall, the movie has it's moments but I felt they could have done a better job with dramaturgy and script.",Don't Look Now
277,Wyluli,Very disappointed.,2,11 February 2006,"I was hoping this movie would be suspenseful, an edge of your seat thriller, or at least hold my interest through the entire story. It was neither. Most of the movie is spent in the watery streets of Venice with absolutely nothing going on (whoops, guess that was a spoiler huh?). I mean I expected some bit of suspense from a movie boasting to be a ""psychic"" thriller. The only remotely interesting parts of the movie are the very beginning and the very ending (as that is the only time anything actually happens) and even the ending made me laugh (I think it was supposed to be horrifying or something). If you like boring movies with a lot of pointless talking etc.. than this is for you. If you like movies that are suspenseful, have an excellent plot, and are fun to watch, then pass on this one. This is one for the artsy, interpretive, ""it was boring and pointless so I liked it"" bunch.",Don't Look Now
