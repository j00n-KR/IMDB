0,MartinHafer,"Sort of like if you took most of the plot out of ""The Hunger Games"" and just focused on the bloodshed",5,26 June 2012,"I wanted to see ""Battle Royale"" for two reasons: it's plot sounded amazingly similar to ""The Hunger Games"" (which I am sure it inspired, as ""The Hunger Games"" debuted after ""Battle Royale"") and it's supposedly one of Quentin Tarantino's favorite films. However, I was a bit hesitant because Takeshi Kitano stars in it--and many of his films are just too violent for my taste. I should also point out that I have never read the books for either of these films nor the manga for ""Battle Royale""--so I can't compare them to the movies.Here is the plot for ""Battle Royale"". Apparently in the near future, unemployment is high, society is in chaos and students begin boycotting school. So, to teach the kids a lesson they (who 'they' are is never explained) randomly choose a class full of kids and have them battle to the death on an island. The lone survivor is allowed to go free. It sure sounds a lot like ""The Hunger Games"", but there are a few exceptions. It doesn't seem like this contest is televised and it's run by a sadistic ex-teacher (Kitano) who taught this same class many years ago. There also is practically no other back story--none. And so, there really isn't a lot of plot--just lots of teens murdering each other, choosing to kill themselves instead of competing or Kitano gratuitously murdering a couple at the outset--just to let them know who's boss! As a result, the film seems much more shallow than ""The Hunger Games"" and you don't really connect with the characters--it's just one blood-splattered death after another. And, speaking of blood, this film has buckets and buckets and buckets. It's clearly among the bloodiest and violent films you can find. Ironically, the film had a rating in Japan that actually would have prevented kids the age of the participants from watching the movie!! The bottom line is that this film has hardly any plot and is just one violent scene after another. It is not a terrible film but it is a bit depraved and not something I'd highly recommend. It did, however, make a butt-load of money is Japan and is among their ten highest grossing (no pun intended) films ever.",Battle Royale
1,Leofwine_draca,All-time Japanese classic,10,23 October 2015,"These days Japan is pretty much seen as the only country to really carry on the tradition of making really important balls-to-the-wall horror: either slow, subtle ghost-burners like DARK WATER, or all-out gore-fests, like BATTLE ROYALE. Yet this latter movie is by no means a straightforward, plot less exercise in violence: in fact it is a dark, dark movie with dark, dark morals. It involves a class of typical school kids butchering each other in increasingly excessive ways; yes, these are real kids playing the kids, and yes, the violence is in your face throughout and doesn't let up. It isn't all doom and gloom, however, as an undercurrent of humour runs throughout the movie, stopping things from becoming too horrible.The casting of Japanese icon ""Beat"" Takeshi as the class teacher, who eats a bag of cookies, sleeps, and occasionally kills kids, is inspired. I've heard a lot about Takeshi and I had been itching to see him in action; he doesn't disappoint with his ultra-weird, warm-hearted character here, dangerous yet vulnerable, a sadistic killer yet also a man with a broken family.This is far from brain-dead entertainment such as the similarly-themed RUNNING MAN, however (not that I'm prejudiced against brain-dead entertainment; far from it, I actually love it to bits). The violent backdrop is actually an excuse to explore the human condition and to see what makes people tick, just like in reality TV series like BIG BROTHER. Some kids vow non-violence and band together as friends or in an attempt to destroy those in charge; doomed lovers kill themselves instead of fighting to the death; some become psychopaths, killing anyone in their path; others fall foul of misunderstandings and end up dying in agony. Watching as each character undergoes a unique arc is what makes this extremely fast paced movie so entertaining.Alternatively, BATTLE ROYALE works just as well as an action movie as a satire, or political statement, or whatever. The kids each have a different weapon, ranging from a tin lid (!) to a machine-gun, and there are tons of shoot-outs, showdowns and bloody murders throughout, you'll never get bored. The script is genuinely unpredictable as in who lives and who dies, and it's very interesting to see the natural winners (such as the pretty girl) becoming increasingly ruthless as they slaughter their way through their classmates as the game progresses. Tatsuya Fujiwara later capitalised on his captivating turn here with a similar one in the DEATH NOTE films. This truly is a unique, imaginative film which rises above its exploitation roots to become a classic piece of entertainment.",Battle Royale
2,Prismark10,Last one standing,8,24 June 2018,"Battle Royale is Japanese horror satire set in a Dystopian Japan that has entered economic decline, where unruly school kids are taught a survivalist lesson. Beat Kitano plays a school teacher stabbed by a pupil who gets revenge on the school kids he once taught.Just before they are about to leave school the adolescents think they are going on a outing, they end up in a small island. They are told that due to the Millennium Educational Reform Act. society now expects them to take part in a survival competition where they will kill each other and they have to do it in three days. The kids have a neck brace which tracks their movements. If they attempt to take it off it will explode, if more than one person is standing by the end of the third day it will explode. The winner gets to leave the island.They are randomly given supplies and weapons and told to set off on the island. They have to avoid certain zones at certain times or they will explode.Some of the kids immediately go on a killing spree, others commit suicide, some join together to figure out a way to escape. A few of the clever kids try to beat the system.The film does not depict many of the kids as evil, they seem to be just normal teenagers. It does have some graphic ways of getting rid off them and some of it is a bit silly.Battle Royale inspired films such as The Hunger Games. It combines the horror of teenagers slaughtering each other, the state sanctioning such killings and a few trying to beat the system. It is an eerie, disturbing film yet curiously enjoyable. I rather cheered when one of them managed to hack the system and had a plan to teach the adults a lesson.",Battle Royale
3,claudio_carvalho,Pointless,6,12 July 2007,"In the beginning of the Twentieth-First Century, the economy of Japan is near a total collapse, with high rates of unemployment and students boycotting their classes. The government approves the Battle Royale Act, where one class is randomly selected and the students are sent to an island wearing necklaces with few supplies and one weapon. After three days, they have to kill each other and the survivor wins his or her own life as a prize. The forty-two students of a ninth grade class are selected to participate in the survival game and abducted in their bus. Under the command of their former teacher Kitano (Takeshi Kitano), they have to eliminate each other following the rules of the sadistic game where only one wins.The screenplay of ""Batoru Rowaiaru"" is badly developed regarding the explanation and advantages of such stupid act. It seems that the writer and the director were only interested in the action of the movie, which is great by the way, and forgot to justify how this survival game could improve a shattered economy or the control of masses, more specifically the students. The way this pointless story is disclosed, most of the students seem to be normal youths, while the government and their teacher seem to be the sadistic villain. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Batalha Real"" (""Royal Battle"")",Battle Royale
4,gavin6942,Best Asian Fighting Movie You'll Ever See,10,26 September 2007,"In the future of Japan, there is a crisis in the world of education. To see who may continue on, the government passes the Battle Royale Act. Forty-two students are kidnapped and brought to a remote island, given random weapons and forced to kill each other. The one remaining kid is able to go home alive. If more than one is alive at the end of the time on the island, everyone is executed and there is no winner.For those of us in America who don't catch a lot of Asian films, perhaps the only face you'll recognize is that of Chiaki Kuriyama, who plays Takako Chigusa (Girl #13). You may recall her from ""Kill Bill"" as Go-Go Yubari, the girl with the mace working with the Crazy 88. The others, apart from Takeshi, are likely completely unrecognizable. But, there's something about this that adds to the whole scenario -- it's hard to pick favorites when the actors are unknown.I watched this as a horror film, but it's not purely a horror film. Sure, it has gore and kids getting hunted down by other kids. It has some connections to ""survival horror"", but it's more of an action-thriller. However, this doesn't take away from the film at all -- it adds to it. The first time I saw the movie, I was in bed and constantly kept jumping up, swinging my fist and yelling ""(expletive) yeah!"" Maybe that's a little silly, but I couldn't contain my excitement for this non-stop action piece.Heads explode, kids get shot, there's jumps to the death. When you have 42 kids and only one can survive, you get a lot of guns, knives and other weapons (even poison) to get the action moving. So much more interesting than your average action film with nothing more than guns blazing (sorry, Bruce Willis).And there's some wild cards. A guy who has survived a previous Battle Royale is thrown in the mix. Another man who is obviously unhinged (a ""transfer student"") dresses like an Asian Heath Ledger and just goes balls out with whole sale slaughter. I didn't want to cheer him on -- he's the villain -- but I couldn't help myself.I can't recall everything right now because I've been drinking heavily. But I will tell you this is the most excited I've been during a film in as long as I can remember. The last time I was excited about anything (movie or not) was in December 2003 during a bad episode of Conan O'Brien where they compared Saddam Hussein to Santa Claus. Seriously, if you see only one foreign action/horror film this year, make it ""Battle Royale"". This blows ""Ju-On"" and ""Pulse"" and ""Ringu"" out of the water for sheer intensity. Possibly the best Asian film ever made.",Battle Royale
5,jboothmillard,Battle Royale,7,9 April 2008,"I recognised the title of this film, but I didn't really know much else, e.g. that it was a Japanese film, or how violent it would be, but I'm glad I gave it a chance. Basically in a not too distant future in Japan is a game show (approved by the government!?) where a class of delinquent unruly school students are taken to a deserted island. They are tagged by necklaces measuring their pulse rate, hearing their every word, and if they try to destroy it killing them by explosion. All students have three days on the island, and in this time they all have to kill each other until there is only one student remaining, the prize is life, if they do not and time is up, they die anyway. They have all been given a variety of weapons and tools to help them in their ""mission"", and there are danger areas on the island, which could kill them if they don't move. Starring Takeshi Kitano as Kitano, Taro Yamamoto as Shougo Kawada - Boys #5, Masanobu Ando as Kazuo Kiriyama - Boys #6, Sousuke Takaoka as Hiroki Sugimura - Boys #11, Tatsuya Fujiwara as Shuya Nanahara - Boys #15, Hirohito Honda as Kazushi Niida Yoriyuki - Boys #16, Eri Ishikawa as Yukie Utsumi - Girls #2, Aki Maeda as Noriko Nakagawa - Girls #15 and Kill Bill's Chiaki Kuriyama as Takako Chigusa - Girls #13. The deaths are obviously all pretty bloody and fun to watch, a good thriller film with a story of survival. Very good!",Battle Royale
6,Woodyanders,Astounding,9,17 December 2012,"Forty-two junior high school students are rounded up and forced to participate in a savage bloodsport that takes place on a remote island over the course of three days. Director Kinju Fukasaku and writer Kenta Fukasaku ingeniously use the gripping premise to turn the themes of trust, friendship, loyalty, betrayal, and competitiveness on their collective ears in the most startling and twisted manner imaginable. While the frequent outbursts of gory and ugly violence pack a ferocious punch, it's the way that old rivalries, petty jealousies, and even schoolyard crushes are brought to the often nasty fore by the participants in the game that gives this picture an extra potent poignancy and resonance. Moreover, the narrative unfolds at a constant swift pace, there's a strong bleak mood of dread and despair throughout, the inspired touches of black humor provide an extra sick sidesplitting kick (the cheery educational video is a total hoot!), and the action scenes are staged with real skill and brio in a realistically clumsy fashion (the sequence with several schoolgirls bumping each other off in a lighthouse in particular is an absolute corker). Tatsuya Fujiwara as the likable Shuya and Aki Maeda as the sweet Noriko make for appealing protagonists. In addition, there's notably chilling work from Masanobu Ando as mute psychotic Kiriyama and Ko Shibasaki as the lethal Mitsuko. Takeshi Kitano also registers strongly as sadistic instructor Kitano. Katsumi Yanagijima's sharp cinematography offers plenty of striking visuals. Masamichi Amano's spirited score makes neat use of familiar classical music cues. Essential viewing.",Battle Royale
7,Tweekums,Shocking yet brilliant,10,12 May 2009,"Set in the the near future Battle Royale depicts a Japan where the youth are out of control and the government takes drastic measures. One of these it the Battle Royale Act; each year a school class are taken to a deserted island where they are forced to fight until only one of them is left alive.We first meet this years class as they are on a bus thinking they are going on an end of year trip, as they go through a tunnel gas is released into the bus rendering them unconscious. When they awake they are in a school room and their former teacher enters to explain the rules to them. The children are fitted with explosive collars and given a kit bag which contains a weapon. These vary from fairly useless items like a pot lid and a pair of binoculars to axes and sub-machine guns. Added to the group are two older boys who's motives for being there are undisclosed at this point.Once outside they act in a variety of ways, some try to kill as many of the others as they can, some try to stay with friends and find away of beating the game and some decide they won't play and take their own lives. Not surprisingly there is quite a lot of violence which seems even more shocking as the children are played by actors in their teens rather than people in their mid-twenties as would expect from a Hollywood film. The acting seemed very good to me although I had to rely on the subtitles as I can't speak Japanese. The action set pieces are exciting, especially the events that take place amongst a group of girls in a lighthouse. If you like gripping action and an interesting story this is a film you need to see.",Battle Royale
8,ma-cortes,Ultra-violent film about adolescents fitted with explosive necklace and abandoned in a desert island,6,2 July 2007,"A future Japanese fascist government has forged a new program for dangerous students,broadcasting live like a reality television movie .In this fictional universe,a class of junior-high school of 42 students is randomly selected and sent a bleak island during three days.There a former professor(Takeshi Kitano)rules a revolutionary survival game called Battle Royale.The abducted class are given a bag with different arms,a map and a few rations of food and tied a collar explodes when they break the rules.They're dispatched to the inhospitable island and sent off to murder each other into a survival game .Someone decide to play the game to death like the psycho assassin teen,while others commit suicide themselves and another are attempting to encounter a way out to get off the empty island where exist a special danger zones.The violent death match game originating an authentic body count to be continued until solely one single winner remain.The film contains action,thrills,rare black humour,blood and is plenty of graphical violence.Excellent action sequences with bloody attacks and violent and blistering fights.The movie displays strong exploitation elements with realistic battles and some characters aren't well defined or one-dimensional but the grisly violence is continuous .It turn out to be a blending about a teens group on abandoned island such as¨Lord of flies¨,the game to death from ¨Running man¨and the tyrannical control by the government of ¨1984¨.Takeshi Kitano or Beat Takeshi is an appropriate villainous teacher in a powerful performance,he's splendid as actor(Gohetto)as director or both(Hanna-Bi,Sonatine,Kikujiro,Brother,Zaitochi).Little known actors ,exception of Chaki Kuriyama(Azumi 2,Ju-on),she's especially famous for his role the teenager killer in ¨Kill Bill vol. I¨.The motion picture is rightly directed by Kinji Fukasaku, an expert Sci-fi and action movies(The green slime,ToraToraTora,Virus).It's followed in 2003 by the second part,an inferior sequel, concerning a new class is sent an island with one aim,the killing of international terrorists.But the director died during the shooting and went on his son,Kenta Fukasaku.",Battle Royale
9,BA_Harrison,"It's not often a film deserves a 'Wow!', but 'Wow!'.",10,21 June 2012,"Kinji Fukusaku's Battle Royale is the cinematic equivalent of being caught in the crossfire of an ambush, its outbursts of darkly humorous yet undeniably brutal violence erupting so suddenly from all directions that it catches the viewer completely by surprise; even on a second viewing, the film's first few deaths still hit like a hail of bullets to the gut.It is this gloriously graphic ultra violence (all the more shocking given that the victims are schoolchildren), combined with moments of biting satire, that makes this film one of the most powerful movies in the history of Japanese cinema. Fukusaku's directorial approach is impeccable, the action scenes suitably adrenaline packed, and the emotional moments truly affecting; the cast is brilliant, with particularly outstanding performances from living legend Takeshi Kitano as Kitano, and Ko Shibasaki as Mitsuko, serious contender for the most callous killer ever; and the soundtrack is wonderful, the rousing classical music perfectly complementing the bloody on-screen mayhem.The fight for survival at all costs is a movie theme almost as old as cinema itself, and one that still resonates in the contemporary film, but rarely is it done as brilliantly as in Battle Royale, a film more than worthy of the maximum rating. 10/10.",Battle Royale
10,Quinoa1984,Royale with not-much cheese,9,4 April 2008,"Battle Royale is the real deal - a truly grim, ultra-violent, just-enough-stylish action movie where the nihilism is completely present from start to finish. It's harrowingly nihilistic even; if there was one message to the picture, aside from perhaps what one could suggest as ""you've got to do anything to survive"" (which is an obvious and even smug message), is that there is no hope in a contest of life and death. Where are Lincoln's ""better angels of our nature""? There aren't any. No way. Not on this island. You better have your gun or knife or lid or paper cup ready, cause the stakes in this f***ed up society are raised up to the point of no return.At its best, and it's often quite amazing, it's something akin to the likes of Peckinpah where I've seen human beings put to a real test of will and fragility. Not to go and sound to precious about it, but this is the kind of work that makes Japan look like it's got a pair when it comes to its graphic works of film, not simply for the violence but for its implications on everybody. What would you do on the island? Another interesting thing that Kinji Fukasaku does (surprisingly spry for a man that hit 70 making the film, it has the feel of someone just starting out) is to not make it very much an indictment of the society at large (not that that isn't part of it- got to keep those population numbers down, what with the bad economy and all). There is some of it underlying the picture, don't get me wrong. But, in fact, aside from the opening scene with the news crew around the previous BR winner, there's almost an indifference among those in charge of the game, including Kitano (played by the one and only Takeshi 'Beat' Kitano), who's outpouring of emotion is for one of the members only. What Fukasaku does do, however, is slightly skate the line of satire and balls-to-the-wall action flick. When the kids are instructed by the video about Battle Royale, the instructor (Yuko Miyamura, masterful for a one-note performance), it's like a bit on South Park. But things start to get extra intense with the constant threat of Kiriyama (Masanobu Ando), who has decided to come *back* to another BR after being declared the winner. His is the prime force of pure animal instinct and savagery, but there's almost something weirdly comic to his manic violence.This line that Fukasaku walks makes it just a tinge more disturbing. Adding to this, there's also a level of human involvement that's absorbing. Going into the film, I almost expected something random to the killings, that we'd follow just the randomness of the murders without a solid central character. This isn't the case, as Nanahara and Nakagawa (15 and 15) are the ones who seem to be leading the front of the plot, souls who have been whittled down already and go on the field trip only to find themselves fending for their lives. There's also a strange entertainment to all of this, not so much in the expected reality-TV-survivor element (Fukasaku's too talented for that) but in just the deconstruction of all humility in the face of certain death.Only the nerds who hack into the system, and up to a point some of the girls, can stay together for too long before wiping themselves out over childhood gripes from before and amplified ten fold (i.e. ""are you still a virgin?"" BANG!) And damn, make no mistake, it's violent, blood red stuff, with just enough outrageousness to make it worthwhile for the genre fans, and with only hints of camp (while not entirely campy, I had a laugh at a scene from the 'special edition' where a flashback shows a girl killing her pedophile father). But the violence, however seemingly it may be to some, isn't senseless. It's all in step with the atmosphere, where dread, inevitability, and a sinking sense of derangement is a marker of most scenes in the film.The only drawback comes as the story starts to 'peter-out' if you will, as the twist comes around after the 'end' of the game, and Kitano has his final scene and then more repeat endings than Return of the Kind. Maybe it's hard to resolve a story like this properly, and there needed to be some sense of a ""happy ending"" (yet, thankfully, still tinged with the nihilism and horror-that-awaits that preceded it). I'm just not sure if it emotionally clicks though, especially with the off-beat 'gotcha' moment involving Kitano and his cell phone, however brilliantly played by Takeshi. That being said as a gripe besides, this is the stuff of cult-movie legend. It's the kind of work overall that gets talked about big-time by those who've seen it to those who haven't. It's built a reputation very quickly as one of the early 21st century's craziest, most fearless science-fiction thrillers, and it's deserved.",Battle Royale
11,BandSAboutMovies,"""You can sneak in, and I encourage you to do so.""",10,26 August 2018,"The director of Battle Royale, Kinji Fukasaku (Tora! Tora! Tora!, Battles Without Honor and Humanity) spent his childhood working in a munitions factory during World War 2. One day, it came under fire and the children were caught in the explosion. Those that survived, like Fukasaku, had to dispose of the bodies of their friends. This is when he realized that adults were lying about the war and he developed a hatred for them that lasted most of his life.Based on the novel by Koushun Takami, the actual Battle Royale is an annual event where one Japanese class is selected to fight. Only one can survive (see The Hunger Games, which while its own work, had to have been inspired by this story). And the rest of the country watches the event live on TV. It's also population control as Japan faces an economic recession (see The Purge).Class 3-B is gassed on a field trip, fitted with collars that can read their vitals (and blow their heads off) and sent to a briefing room where they encounter their former teacher, Kitano (Takeshi ""Beat"" Kitano, a cultural force in his own right). There's a crazy scene here where a cheerful girl explains the rules of Battle Royale in the same way you'd explain how to play a video game. But after Kitano kills two students - including the one who wounded him and caused his retirement from teaching - for horseplay, everyone knows that this is no game.Within six hours, 12 of the 42 students are dead, mostly at the hands of Mitsuko Souma and Kazuo Kiriyama, two girls who take the Mean Girls and Heathers archetype to its logically homicidal endgame.The two main characters, Shuya Nanahara and Noriko Nakagawa, are determined to survive together. Along the way, there are twists, turns, double crosses and over the top amounts of violence. They're assisted by Kawada, who has already won a past Battle Royale at the cost of his girlfriend's life.By the end, only Kiriyama is trying to win the game. Everyone else is trying to beat the system and escape the island. After a large battle, it seems at the end only Kawada survives, as he kills our heroes. But it's all a ruse - he knew that Kitano can hear everything on the microphones they wear. Kitano then sends everyone else home, as he wants to kill Kawada himself.As the three enter Kitano's base they find an unhinged painting of the entire class, all foretelling how they would die, with only Noriko as the sainted survivor, painted as if she has ascended to godhood.
Beat Takeshi painted this himself for the movie.
He tells them that she was the only one worthwhile and he wants her to kill him. His daughter had rejected him, as we learn when he tries to reconnect with her throughout the film. He threatens her with his gun and Shuya shoots him. It turns out that his gun was just a water pistol and before he dies, his daughter calls one last time to argue with him.As they leave the island, Kawada dies from his wounds, happy that he has finally found true friendship. Our heroes are now on the fun, branded as murderers, but are determined to never stop running.The casting for this film was just wild - 6,000 hopefuls tried out with 800 being trained and of those, 42 made it into the movie.When released, the film was R15, a rating in Japan that keeps those 15 and under away from the film. Fukasaku complained that this audience needed to see the film most of all, but the government condemned the movie. This led Fukasaku to say to teenagers, ""you can sneak in, and I encourage you to do so."" And while it's played in the US at some limited engagements, it's never been formally released in the wake of Columbine.A film this visually intense, action-packed and boundary pushing? Of course, it's influenced Western culture. And you need look no further than Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill, where Chiaki Kuriyama, the actress who played Takako Chigusa, was cast as Gogo Yubari. And the Marvel Comic Avengers Arena took young superheroes and pretty much ripped off this film, even using a variation of the logo.There's been talk of an American remake and even a TV show on the CW, but luckily, this has never happened. Why remake what is pretty much a perfect film, filled with cultural winks, ultraviolence and an actual message and transform it into a Westernized mess?",Battle Royale
12,Coventry,It is SICK !! ... I love it,7,20 October 2003,"SPOILERS AHOY !!!Battle Royale is one of those few films that totally lives up to its reputation. It's pretty simple : if you're able to come up with a story like this...you either belong in a mental institution or at the top list of controversial cinema. Both categories are pretty much the same, though. Battle Royale is a creative and very violent film that doesn't care too much about human emotions and relations. Disturbing and sick cinema as pure as it gets and I like this kind of films. Battle Royale is a very apocalyptic view on society but I don't think it's as realistic as some people claim. Disturbing and fascinating, yes but not really something to worry about in the near future ( I hope )I doubt organisations like Amnesty International will allow this to happen but Battle Royale is the name of a new law introduced in Japan since the new Millenium. Because most teenagers boycot school and start riots everywhere, the government thought up a little project. Entire classes of both sexes are sent to a deserted island and there ... they have to wipe out each other until only one person is left. How do you like that as a shooltrip ? They each receive one weapon and furthermore, there are no rules. Start slashing !! Battle Royale is by far the best movie coming from Japan I've ever seen. I'm not the biggest fan of that nation's cinema but I can't deny there are a few great minds active there. Especially the last few years. Battle Royal is brutal, raw, intense and very original and dared. There are a few aspects that really contribute to making this film so good. The element of surprise is by far the most important aspect. Compared to most American films, you have absolutely no idea who'll get killed first and you feel that everybody is likely to die. The violence is shown in a very expressive way and they don't leave much to the imagination. Some scenes are really sick and very gore. The fact that the victims are young people ( most of them only look like they're 15 years old or something ) makes this movie almost hard to watch from time to time.The whole hunting game is very fascinating to follow since it's so creative. Some kids are giving fire-weapons or knives but some others only have a transmitter or a bulletproof vest to survive. Surprises are there to detect constantly. Not one boring moment. The sentiment is kept low in this film and I thank the makers for that. Also, there's a great use of classical music and that always helps to create a unique atmosphere. I even liked the acting in this one and normally, I think most Japanese actors look like wooded puppets. Highly recommended, though not for everyone. If you're easily offended or shocked it may be better to skip this one. Favorite ""rewind""-scene : The teacher immediately shows that the trip isn't a joke and punishes a girl who whispers during his explanation in a very rough way... It's up to you to find out what this way is. Enjoy !",Battle Royale

14,Theo Robertson,Half Baked,4,11 May 2004,"BATTLE ROYALE as it`s known in Britain is a movie crawling with ideas . Alas the producers don`t really have a clue to script a movie . "" At the end of the millenuim crime rockets with 10 million people unemployed and 800,000 schoolchildren playing truant "" screams the opening caption . May I just point a couple of things out1 ) Seeing as this movie was released in the year 2000 it seems ridiculous that the collapse in Japanese society takes place the same year the movie was released . Much better to have set BATTLE ROYALE in the mid 21st century
2 ) "" Show . Don`t tell "" is the mantra of every screen writing course I`ve attended . Captions setting up the action is lazy writing
Oh and how does 800,000 children skipping school signify the collapse of civilization ? In fact if Japanese schools are half as bad as British inner city schools you have to admire the kids intelligence for not wanting to attendSo as the plot moves on 42 schoolkids find themselves being sent to an island where they have to face mortal danger , but just as we`re introduced to someone we think will be the main character they get killed off so the screenplay lacks character focus , and as several people have already pointed out what is this movie trying to be . Is it violent satire ? Is it black comedy ? Is it a straight forward action adventure story like THE RUNNING MAN ?I have been quite impressed with the handful of Japanese horror movies that I`ve seen .

15,Hey_Sweden,"Smart, gut-wrenching survival thriller.",10,10 September 2014,"The premise for this stylish and intense film is certainly one that reels you in: in a Japan of the future, society is breaking down. The youth are rebelling and refusing to attend school. In an attempt to put them in their place, the adults create a Battle Royale Act as well as a ""game"". A grade 9 class is chosen at random and taken to an abandoned island and forced to kill each other; only one person is allowed to walk away when it's all over. Characters are provided with props, some lethal and therefore useful,others rather useless.Director Kinji Fukasaku has crafted here a compelling, intelligent, and very daring tale. He proves to be up to the task of combining a lot of over the top violence (some characters take an awful lot of bullets before they go down) with a generous array of emotionally affecting character moments. We get to know many of these participants and see their back stories. The two people we follow the most are good friends Shuya (Tatsuya Fujiwara) and Noriko (Aki Maeda). They're both very likable, as is Taro Yamamoto as the helpful Kawada. Chiaki Kuriyama of the ""Kill Bill"" films and Japanese icon Takeshi Kitano are also well worth watching.While it's known that it took ""Batoru Rowaiaru"" a while to be widely seen in North America because of sensitivity to the issue of violence in schools, Fukasaku never once glorifies this bloodshed. In fact, what makes it so damn upsetting and memorable is because we can really sympathize with these kids. Most of them, one VERY bad apple aside, are not the hellions we're led to believe from the exposition provided. The best moments tend to be the serious ones.The concept does force a viewer to ponder that horrible question: would any of us have the nerve to kill a friend in order to save our own skin? Who would ever want to have to answer that question?Once seen, this is not a film that's easily forgotten.10 out of 10.",Battle Royale
16,poolandrews,"""Looks like someone was here all night, I found a tampon in the toilet."" Overrated but still pretty good Japanese horror/action thing.",7,2 June 2006,"Batoru Rowaiaru, or Battle Royale as it's commonly known amongst English speaking audiences, starts by informing us that at the dawn of the millennium Japan as a nation collapsed. Japan suffered from 15% unemployment & 10 million people out of work while 80,000 student boycotted school, apparently adults started to fear the young & so passed a law called the 'BR Act'. The 42 classmates of the 9th Grade class from Zenjutsi high school are on a field trip when they are gassed out on the bus, when they come round they are told by one of their ex teacher's named Kitano (Takeshi Kitano & Beat Takeshi) that they have been chosen to take part in Battle Royale the ultimate game of life & death, they are on an isolated island where the target is to be the last living person by any means necessary, if at the end of 72 hours there is more than one person left alive everyone dies, there are no rules as it's kill or be killed. Friends turn on friends while some stick together but all have the same problem, to survive & get back home safely...This Japanese production was written, co-produced & directed by Kinji Fukasaku & is in my opinion a wildly overrated film, that's not to say it's a bad film as I thought it was a pretty good one but I don't see why it's so highly regarded. According to the IMDb's 'Alternate Versions' section there are two different cuts of Batoru Rowaiaru, a shorter one & a longer director's cut which is the one I will be basing my comment on. The script by Fukasaku is apparently based on a novel by Koushun Takami & is hard to categorise, is it a horror? A thriller? An action film? Batoru Rowarariu starts off really well, the opening 60 odd minutes fly by & it is both gripping & entertaining but then it settles into a somewhat repetitive routine which I found became very dull. In my opinion Batoru Rowaiaru goes on for too long (obviously the shorter version rectifies this to some extent) & I started to lose interest well before the end. There are also things that bugged me about the story, why did the Japanese Government think sending 40 odd kids out to kill each other would solve all of Japan's problems? It just doesn't make any logical sense. Are the events on the island being broadcast on TV? The reason I ask this is there are never any cameras to film what's happening & even the soldiers use sensors attached to the pupils collars to keep track of them & if it was broadcast on TV why did the kids not know what to do? Why were they so surprised by the whole thing? If it isn't broadcast on TV then I again ask the question what's the point since no one else knows anything about it? Those so-called Danger Zones, what was meant to happen if someone strayed into one? Was it ever mentioned? Then there's the end which is full of embarrassing sentiment & a moment which falls into total comedy when someone supposedly dead answers the phone then dies after he has hung up! Having said that it's still a good watch, the story is cool, the character's are decent & the one's that get screen time are well fleshed out & it's one of those films where you have fun by keep thinking to yourself what you would do in the same situation. If you want to look deeper into the film I suppose it's main message is about trust but moral messages aside Batoru Rowaiaru has a decent story to it.Director Fukasaku was 70 years old when he made this & he does an OK job, there are some nice scenes here & some cool violence. Personally after hearing how violent it was I was disappointed to discover that there are a lot of gunshot wounds, an exploding head, a slit throat, some stabbings, someone coughs up some blood & someone has their throat blown to pieces. Overall I'd say Batoru Rowariaru wasn't that graphic neither was it that disturbing or effective, I've seen much gorier films than this.With a supposed budget of about $4,500,000 the film is well made throughout. The film is subtitled in English with the original Japanese performances seeming OK.Batoru Rowaiaru is a good film, I'm not that much of a fan of Asian horror but this this ain't half bad but at the same time I didn't love it like so many people seem to. Definitely worth a watch but don't expect the best thing since sliced bread because it's not.",Battle Royale
17,dbborroughs,Wicked Satire on (Japanese) Society,8,16 July 2004,"This is the story of a Japan so out of control that in order to regain control (I think) they stage a survival game that makes TV's Survivor look like a walk in the park. One class of kids is dumped on an island and told that the last one alive wins. This is a very very funny movie in a black comedy sort of way. Its very violent and bloody and makes you wonder about why you're laughing since its not all that far off from the way society operates, especially Japanese society, where kids regularly kill themselves for not getting into the right school.Its not for all tastes. Some people will find the idea offensive, a fact that has kept the film from having an official US release. If you can take your comedy black as night, then see this movie.8 out of 10",Battle Royale

20,Boba_Fett1138,A brilliant and unique treat.,10,21 March 2009,"All you need for a great movie is a good and original concept. At least that is what this movie suggests. It's daring and unique concept makes this an original movie for sure but it handles its concept also with lots of class and depth, making this simply a brilliant Japanese movie from the late Kinji Fukasaku.Out of all Japanese movies I've seen so far, this is also the one that is the most Americanized. Normally this isn't a very good sign when a 'foreign' movie gets made in Hollywood-style but this movie is truly an exception to this. The fact that this movie feels Hollywood like is also a reason why this movie is perfectly watchable and accessible, even for those who aren't at custom with movies from outside of the United States.But however this really doesn't mean that this movie is your average typical Hollywood work. Quite on the contrary. The movie has a quite daring concept, that perhaps also sounds silly and unlikely at first but in the movie gets delivered as a real realistic and effective one.The movie can be seen as a protest against modern (Japanese) society and perhaps also the media. It gives ""Batoru rowaiaru"" also some more depth with its story and themes. It's not just its concept that makes this a great and original movie but also truly the handling of it all.The main concept is very simple but at the same time very intriguing. It raises some real moral questions about what you would do when you get into a situation like this. The story is about an average Japanese ninth-grade school class who are being forced to kill each other on a remote island in a freaky death-match, in which the only survivor after 3 days gets to get back home. If more than 1 person is still alive after 3 days, everyone dies. This all due to the Battle Royale Act, that is called to life due to the highly increasing insubordination of the Japanese youth, that causes the Japanese economy to decrease rapidly.The movie has lots of different characters in it, of which some have less problems with killing their friends than others. Some play the game really fanatically, while others team up, in order to survive longer and also to try and find a way to end the game without having to kill their friends. Everyone plays their own game and no matter what their intentions and morals are, all are being forced to do something against their own nature, due to the very unusual circumstance they find themselves in.The diversity of characters also ensures that the movie never gets boring or 'more of the same' all of the time. The movie has some real great characters in it that are big movie stereotypes but really work out well for this type of movie. It gives lots of different characters room but never without loosing focus on its two main characters. The fact that most youngsters are being played by real teenagers also helps. It increases the credibility and also makes it easier to identify with characters.Of course the movie is also filled with violence, done Japanese-style. The movie is pretty straight-forward with its violence, from pretty early on already into the movie. Again, this also really adds to the realism and overall credibility of the movie. For Japanese standards its also a pretty expensive and big looking movie with its action, even though the movie only cost a mere $4,500,000 to make. Due to its nature the movie never became a big success outside of Japan, since no distributors dared to buy the movie and release it in different countries. In Japan the movie remains one of the most successful box office successes and the movie has also really founds its way outside of the Japanese boundaries and the movie now days is known in most countries and considered to be a cult-classic already.One of the most daring and original movies I've seen in a while.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Battle Royale
21,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Jaw-dropping from start to finish,10,18 January 2010,"I haven't read the novel, but I certainly am considering it. This is also the only thing by Fukasaku that I've watched, which I most definitely intend to change. And finally, this will not be the last Japanese film that I take in. This is immensely shocking, tragic, funny, sad, frenetic and enjoyable. I couldn't tell you how many times this yanked the carpet out from under me, and yet, as paradoxical as it may sound, I had no trouble following it. Somehow this manages to not overstimulate the viewer to the point where it becomes unpleasant, and yet create an atmosphere of constant threat and danger, and compelling drama. It seems utterly *unreal* how well this builds and maintains tension. The characters are all credible and the psychology is all spot-on; the only negative I can truly say about this, and it is a minor complaint, is that I could honestly not keep track of everyone, and tell them all apart from one another. This has perfect pacing, it is amazing how much energy there is in it, and yet it doesn't lose the audience at any point. The action is outstanding and exciting. This is engaging, absurd, beautiful, with moments of creepiness... I could go on. The music is impeccable, the score and classical pieces alike. There is a lot of bloody, at times gory and/or brutal, violence and disturbing content in this. The DVD comes with a 34 minutes long behind the scenes featurette and two trailers, however, for some reason, on the Scandinavian released disc, none of those three(unlike the movie itself), are subtitled. I recommend this to everyone who can handle it. 10/10",Battle Royale
22,view_and_review,Before There was The Hunger Games,5,10 July 2021,"The best and only comparison for ""Battle Royale"" is ""The Hunger Games."" Though released before ""The Hunger Games,"" I'd call this a rated R Japanese version of ""The Hunger Games.""Forty high school students get kidnapped and taken to a remote island to battle it out until only one remains alive. The rules are very simple: last one living wins; if more than one teen survives then they all die. The teens are outfitted with neck collars that can be detonated remotely. Obviously, they can't be removed. If they are tampered with they will detonate.They have three days to kill each other. They are all given random weapons, from a fully automatic rifle down to binoculars (if you can call that a weapon). The island they're on is divided into zones that the ""game"" supervisors make into danger zones to force the action.Like I said, this was just like the movie ""The Hunger Games"" except worse. ""The Hunger Games"" was a bigger, better quality production, so the effects, picture, sound, and acting were all better. The acting in ""Battle Royale"" was deplorable. It was bad enough hearing the English dub which will make a mockery of the best foreign movie, but in addition to that the acting was downright awful. With better acting, even in spite of the low budget, this movie could've rivaled ""The Hunger Games."" As it was though, ""Battle Royale"" was pretty entertaining.",Battle Royale
23,movieman_kev,"who wouldn't want to off some shallow, narcissistic teens?",8,2 March 2005,"42 high school students most from a randomly selected class ,thanks to a newly passed law, are drugged and sent to an island, where they are outfitted with explosive collars and ordered to participate in a game of killing each other off to be the last person standing. This foreign film was good for the most part.Sort of like an exaggerated ""Lord of the Flies"" for a new generation. Not that original plot-wise. But enjoyable all the same, especially for exploitation fans. I feel that the Director st rived for a tad more then to be exploitative, but on that point he failed. Also the ending didn't quite jibe for me and there's a little too many plot-holes to make this one an outright classic, but if you just take it for what it is, you'll enjoy the ride. Followed by a horrid sequel that only taints the greatness of the original.My Grade: B+",Battle Royale
24,safenoe,Made more than a decade before The Hunger Games,10,5 November 2016,"If you like politically correct, family friendly fare, then please move and watch The Hunger Games. Otherwise, brace yourself for Battle Royale, a top Japanese movie from 2000 that has to be one of the best movies in modern history.It's a roller coaster ride and quite moving in many respects. Yes it's violent and it's not for everyone, but you wonder how we would react if such a scheme really was in place.The production values are impressive, and the story is fast-paced. All credit to the talented director and of course the producers: Kenta Fukasaku, Kinji Fukasaku, Kimio Kataoka, Chie Kobayashi, Toshio Nabeshima, and Masumi Okada.",Battle Royale
25,The_Void,Could you kill your best friend?,8,21 October 2003,"Is the question put before 42 Japanese school children, minutes after waking up from being put to sleep and minutes before they will fight in a bloody battle to the death. Seconds after the children learn their probable fate, they are greeted with a video. An upbeat video, the sort of video you would expect at a McDonalds induction day, but this video explains the rules of the 'game'. ""No whispering"" the sadistic teacher exclaims, before launching a flick knife into the forehead of one unlucky girl. As you would expect, the class react with shock, one child saying in surprise ""It's really real"", another child finds out first hand the use for the dog collars around their necks. After the video and the weapons are given out, there are many different reactions to the situation, as you might expect. Some of the youngsters try to become revolutionaries and stop the violence, others refuse to fight, choosing suicide over murder and some accept the situation and fight for their survival.From here on out, the adrenaline fuelled violence is thick and fast, within the first minute of the game starting, one girl approaches the screen with an arrow through her neck, asking her former friend ""What is this?"" seconds after, her crossbow wielding attacker screams his way out of the bushes, only to be taken down less than a minute later by another class mate.The build up to the Battle Royale is some of the best I've ever seen. The story is put up on the screen against a backdrop of computer animation and then it switches to a journalist reporting on a previous Battle Royale, ""The winner is a girl"" she exclaims, ""She's smiling, she smiling"" She continues as the girl in the back of the truck gives a sick smile, reminiscent of what she just went through. By this point I was wondering if the rest of the film would stand up to the intro, it sure did.The plot, as you might expect is a little silly. The economy in Japan has gone down the pan, 15% of people are unemployed and many schoolchildren are boycotting their schools, as the message on the board reads ""Not coming cos we don't feel like it"". So what do Japan do to thwart this economic depression? Lower interest rates! No. Create more jobs! No. Make truancy against the law! no, no, no. This is Japan. Those crazy Japs decide to pass the new 'Battle Royale act'. An act in which a class of children, chosen by an impartial lottery is put on an island, to fight to the death. Of course, this is unrealistic but what it does do is show the authorities will to create law and order, and the younger generation's compulsion to rebel against it, which also brings in the philosophical argument of the alienation between older and younger people. It is this whole deepness to the film that a lot of people will unfortunately miss due to the large amounts of violence.But, the main aspect of Battle Royale is the will to survive, and also the will for the survival of your loved ones, which is personified through the character of one of the 'exchange' students (cant remember his name...the good one). A person who is on the island, after surviving a previous Battle Royale, and also being forced to kill his girlfriend, for his own survival (one of the rules - only one survivor). This character talks about the way his girlfriend smiled, and thanked him after he shot her, and how he thought they could both survive.This film has lots of characters, 43 of them in fact. So, obviously not all of them are given a chance to develop, but the ones that are develop beautifully. The film uses flash backs for various characters, which helps the audience to see why certain characters act how they do. Such as the 'exchange' student who spares the life of our hero's, Nanahara and his girlfriend. At first this may seem silly, as anyone in the game can kill you, but it comes into perspective when we learn he himself survived a Battle Royale and the two reminded him of himself and his girlfriend.This film only really has one other film which it can be compared to, and that film would be Stanley Rubric's, A Clockwork Orange. The most notable thing that has been borrowed from that film is the ultra violence which is set to a beautiful classical soundtrack. And secondly the whole moral debate which surrounds each one, the free will argument in Clockwork Orange and the will to survive in this film.The ending is one of only two things that I would criticise this film on, the little twist at the end was nice and it showed where the characters went next, but the way they tacked on the 'requiem' sequences, I felt was unnecessary as they could have been put in the film elsewhere, or even better, not at all. The other criticism would be the way that some of the film was over dramatic, such as the part where the teacher showed the survivors the (sick) picture he drew of the Battle Royale.Anyway, despite its minor imperfections this film receives top marks from me. There isn't many films that will over step the mark and go a little further, but Battle Royale does just that. A masterpiece",Battle Royale
26,HumanoidOfFlesh,Incredible masterpiece made by Kinji Fukasaku.,10,10 February 2004,"""Battle Royale"" is one of the most controversial and challenging movies ever made.The film is very gory and violent,but it's also witty,satirical and thought provoking.The concept of ""Battle Royale"" is pretty simple.The act of Battle Royale decrees that once a year a class of 9th graders is chosen at random,stranded on a small island,and armed with random weapons.The kids are also outfitted with strange necklaces that monitor their locations and life functions,and explode if more than one student is alive at the end of 72 hours.The kids are forced to become savage killers,and the movie provides them with interesting personalities and human reactions to the horrible situation in which they find themselves.The acting is brilliant and the violence is horrific and merciless.The film is very exciting and well-photographed.A masterpiece that needs to be seen by every fan of wonderful Japanese cinema!",Battle Royale
27,StevePulaski,A brilliant picture I probably can't sit through twice,10,29 April 2012,"All your friends have become your opponents. All your alliances and friendships you've worked so hard to form have quickly decimated into nothing. Every shred of moral-upbringing and integrity you occupied has now been eliminated. Kinji Fukasaku's Battle Royale is a grim picture, one that has been brought back into mainstream conversation with the release of the film The Hunger Games. Many have cited that it was a ripoff, a mere act of plagerism on the author's part. I went into Battle Royale with that in mind, and came out with this thought; one is a haunting picture, visually graphic and darkly captured. The other is the ideas reduced gradually and taken with a mainstream focus, diluted unconditionally for teenagers. They occupy similar premises, but they are by no means synonymous in terms of commentary. This is one of the most violent pictures I have yet to see.The story goes like this; a ninth grade class boards a bus, and when they wake up, they are entering a cold and bleak room. In that room is where their last act of true communication with each other will take place, before they become savage, desperate, and utterly fearful. Due to an increasingly dismal economy and the lack of employment, a lot of the blame has been put on school-children, who are dubbed incompetent and disrespectful by the Japanese government. As punishment, every year a ninth grade class, selected at random, will be placed on an isolated island, where they will be forced to murder each other up until one person remains. If three days pass, and more than one person remains, everyone will die.Upon their arrival, they are shown a video and realize that indestructible bracelets have been placed around their neck that will be triggered to explode if any intolerable behavior occurs. They are given a duffel bag with food rations, water, a map, a compass, a flashlight, and a random weapon to help them survive. The weapons range from a pot lid to a heavy-duty, rapid fire machine gun. Is it fair? Absolutely not. Is it justifiable? Not at all. It is an unlawful, disgusting game these children are forced to play and are forced to answer this question without any contemplation; would they kill their best friend? Impulse takes over before an answer can be given.Our lead character is Shuya Nanahara (Fujiwara), a naive, yet idealistic soul who alines early with a young girl (Maeda) and a transfer student (Yamamoto) to hopefully come out victorious. But only one can win, so the inevitable is always looming over their heads. Each kids' goal is the same; to thrive as long as possible on what little you have. Within the first few minutes of the game various kids are killed. Captions stating the child's number pop up frequently so a body count is always kept in place.I almost forgot to mention the ""danger zones."" The map you are given has a grid on it, and four times a day an intercom announcement is made by the teacher to state who is dead and what the danger zones are. If you are caught in one of these danger zones and do not get out in time, your neck bracelet is activated and decimation will not be far in your future.I believe why I stated the film is one of the most violent I have ever seen is because we actually see young children get killed; something that never happens in American cinema. Japanese cinema is a whole different ballgame, and before you dismiss this as a Japanese shock picture along the lines of the Guinea Pig series, let me say that this film is deeper and more substantially constructed than a slew of other action/torture epics.For one, there is a great deal of characterization and depression in this film, but it never comes off as gratuitously placed or indecent and inept. Occasional instances of dark humor pop up, but the persistent feeling of sadness will soon catch up with you. The film plays like William Golding's novel Lord of the Flies, only with more graphic savagery and tormenting monologues. At times the film becomes even more versatile, having scenes that depict a brewing teenage melodrama.Some of the saddest scenes come from not the violent aspects, but the human discussions between the students. They are poignant and gritty, as these children are faced with the inevitable feeling of dying and the convoluted conglomerate of emotions that currently plague them. They are so confused and consumed with remorse we wonder why they were thought to be savages delinquents in the first place. We see them try to cope with what has been unfairly placed on them, as well as the tragic loss of innocence they are currently enduring.This is a brilliantly executed film, one so upsetting, violent, relentless, and depressing I doubt I'll be able to sit through it again. Reiterating my point about The Hunger Games, I find that film to be a shallower take on a subject with potential. The film wasn't bad, but it lacked any formal commentary on the society the children endured, was vastly limited by its rating, and was void of any emotional impact. Battle Royale occupies all of that and, despite a strong whirlwind of controversy and a hefty rating, it is one teenagers (think about sixteen and up) should definitely seek out. It serves and holds up better than a greatly neutered trendy film.Starring: Tatsuya Fujiwara, Aki Maeda, Taro Yamamoto, Chiaki Kuriyama, Kou Shibasaki, Masanobu Ando, and Takeshi Kitano.

28,KineticSeoul,Survival/horror at it's best...A brilliant Japanese film,9,22 March 2012,"This is hands down one of the best Japanese movie ever made. It's a character driven movie that is done really well. Although the characters is basically the whole students in a class room. Which totals about 42 students. This movie does a real good job of building those characters, even by slightly which is impressive considering this movie is less than 2 hours long. This is also Quentin Tarantino's favorite movie from the 90's and for good reason and isn't really a shock. Since it has just about all the elements that Tarantino gets inspired from. I don't think he is a bit of a overrated director by his work but still...For him to rank this movie as number one shows how good it is. The build up is really quick as well, since the students get put in Battle Royale just 5 minutes in. If you want a more detailed development I recommend the novel this movie is based on or even the manga. This is simply a gripping and enthralling flick, that will get you immersed from the beginning to end. If your one of those audience that don't like things that are grotesque or very violent, than this won't be the movie for you. To the rest if you miss this movie, you will be missing out, especially for people that really enjoy films. There just isn't any boring moment in this movie, just about every part is thrilling to the point it hardly gives a breather. So the premise is about a class room full of students getting put on a island to kill each other because of a game called Battle Royale and each one gets a bag either filled with weapons or something useless. This is because the students became too rebellious and the adults became afraid of them, thus they allowed this horrendous program to go on. Sure this premise has been done before but this is probably the first one to do it in a manner that is super effective. It's simply a survival/horror film at it's best and even has creepy psychological aspects to it as well. Like how far would you go to survive? The script isn't something that is perfect but it's still very effective and the acting is believable as well, although slightly over the top. The special effects is passable especially since this came out in the early 2000. I usually don't go by what critics say but this movie deserves the positive feedback it's been getting. I am not sure if this flick did well in japan, I assume it did but it isn't a shock that it's become a cult film although a lot of film lovers watched this. There will be a lot of movies in the future that will have elements that came from this movie because it will inspire either the directors or the writers. If you enjoy watching movies or any cult films than do not pass on this one. This one deserves a 9.3/10. This came out in the year 2000 but still holds up today and even beats some movies of this genre in the present. Just don't bother watching the sequel even out of curiosity, unless you really have to. But it's going to ruin the experience with this one, it just lacked just about everything that made this one great.9.3/10",Battle Royale
29,bensonmum2,"""Here's your list of friends in the order they died.""",8,23 August 2006,"I finally got the chance to see what all the fuss is about. For the most part, Battle Royale lives up to the hype. The violence is as over-the-top as I had been led to believe. What I wasn't expecting, however, was such a well made, engrossing film that's full of some of the blackest humor I've seen in a while. For those uninitiated, Battle Royale is the story of one class of young teens in Japan that are chosen at random to participate in the government's new ""game"" designed to put order back into society. The class is taken to a deserted island and each member of the class is given a weapon. At the end of three days, the one class member left alive is the winner. If more than one person is alive, everyone dies. The plot may seem completely ridiculous and outlandish, but it works. It's difficult not to be drawn into the film from the very beginning. The action comes fast and furious as classmates kill each other in a variety of inventive ways. Friendships are put to the test, trust becomes something foreign, and love means nothing when it's kill or be killed. Director Kinji Fukasaku does a masterful job of making the characters seem real and sympathetic in Battle Royale  even those with limited time on screen. The acting is good, the special effects are believable, and the cinematography and lighting are well done. Overall, Battle Royale is a nice combination of compelling story and technical know-how.Battle Royale could have been a near perfect film if it weren't for two faults that I can't look past. First, there are too many unnecessary love stories. While I understand the need to present the relationship between the two main characters, is it necessary to hear every teenager's deathbed confession of love? Maybe this was part of Fukasaku's sense of humor, but it quickly became tiresome. Second, the ending is a let-down. I was expecting and hoping for an ending as gratuitous as the rest of the film. Instead, Battle Royale limps to a finale that's uncharacteristically bland given everything that came before. Regardless of these two criticisms, Battle Royale is a film that's well worth seeking out. It's a one of a kind experience and new favorite of mine.",Battle Royale
30,theowinthrop,A Look at Paranoia Shattering Trust,9,20 July 2008,"I finally was able to see this entire film today. Based on a modern best seller from Japan it has been seen as a critique of Japanese society, the modern U.S. ""empire"", and fascism. One can see the military hardware and trained soldiers around remind one of the modern American Army, but that's about it (as far as I can see). The treatment of the high schoolers and the burned out depressed state of Japan (with the militarism) can be a commentary on the collapse of capitalism or the rise of dictatorships, but the use of the name ""the East Asian Republic"" seems a dig at the old Imperialist Japanese dream of a ""Greater East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere"" in the 1920s-1940s. But it is more modern - note the Japan after the economic crash is a Republic.BATORU ROWAIARU (better known abroad as BATTLE ROYALE) is about a future Japan that is a dictatorship, and is deadly afraid of the threat of youth. A law has been passed to run a yearly contest where a high school class is chosen by lottery. It's students are put on an island, and ordered (by threat of death) to fight each other to the death until either one or none are left. The threat of death is a real one. When their former teacher is telling them that this is serious, he has trouble with a female and a male student. He throws a knife into the female students skull, and demonstrates on the male student that the metal collars put on the students' necks happens to be rigged to explode if they tamper with them or try to remove them. What happens, of course, is that the students soon are at each other's throats (with a few notable exceptions). It somewhat reminiscent here of LORD OF THE FLIES, with warfare breaking out between two groups, but here it is everyone for themselves. Occasionally we see the teacher and the military at the high school headquarters on the island, but most of the time we don't see the adults (with one exception). The three students who cooperate are Noriko, Shuya, and Kawada. Shuya was a friend of the student who was used to demonstrate the explosive qualities of those collars, and he feels guilty that he could not help his friend when he was screaming for assistance. Noriko was the girlfriend of the same fellow. The two end up promising to protect each other, and are eventually allied with Kawada, a survival expert who was one of two transfer students to their class. While other students try to cooperate, they meet with various degrees of fortune (mostly bad). As for the adults, the only one we get to know is their teacher, who is an unsuccessful parent and a hateful teacher Kitano (one of the male students stabs him at the start of the film, prior to the scene shifting to the island). The teacher happens to like Noriko, who is a sweet girl and reminds the teacher of the kind of child he would have liked to have had rather than what he does (his own daughter tells him over the phone that his breath stinks even over the phone).To many people viewing the film it seems like a war between age groups (vigorous, hopeful, democratic youth vs. fearful grown-ups). It is, but to see it only that way misses some points. The game or test is to purposely shatter the unanimity of the students, and it is not as hard as one would think. It has been said that the cruelest of human beings are children, and this film shows that is true. The girls have social cliques, and they constantly turn against outsiders. These frictions pop up in one-on-one confrontations, and also in a massive massacre sequence in a lighthouse, supposedly between girls who were friends. In the latter situation, when one of the more sensible girls tries to calm things down, one of her supposed friends tells her to knock off the leadership crap. As for the boys, a trio do work together to save as many as possible by some computer hacking and weapons building, but their work is smashed by the most frightening figure in the film, a second transfer student who enjoys killing people.The results are a thoughtful film, and a basically sad one. Unlike the rescue of the boys in LORD OF THE FLIES the bulk of the students die here. I won't say if any survive. But the same result of this film was done in a TWILIGHT ZONE episode dealing with a power failure in a neighborhood - it only took Rod Serling 30 minutes rather than two hours to do that. I actually like BATTLE ROYALE (the acting and directing is good, and the scenery fine). But the message could have been given to us in a faster manner.",Battle Royale

32,lost-in-limbo,Kill for survival or be killed!,9,30 January 2005,"40 Ninth grade students and two transfer students have 3 days on a island to wipe each other out, only one can survive and if not they shall all die.This controversial Japanese film is a real favourite of mine, a fascinating tale of human instinct for survival by any type of means. It has a really macabre atmosphere, where the tension and suspense never faults from the beginning to the end. While the pace of the film never lets up... well maybe there is two or three slow scenes of mushy melodrama- but that's when we learn what's going on in their heads and it doesn't disrupt the flow of sheer adrenaline that the film generates or even the sombre mood. At times the dialogue is a bit corny and lame- but it didn't seem to bother me. The violence throughout is brutally shocking and adds in some funny black humour. You might enjoy the violence- but when you get to know the characters we then feel sorrow for the students as friendships are stretched, some going mad, some taking their own lives, some bonding & scheming and others out to kill- but nothing can stop the paranoia creeping into this game of survival.Excellent performances from Tatsuya Fujiwara and Aki Maeda as the two young lovers Shuya and Nuriko that stick together, Masanobu Ando the quiet cold blooded killer Kiriyama and Taro Yamamoto as the helpful but mysterious transfer student Kawada and there is Takeshi Kitanoas as Beat Takeshi their year 7 ex-school teacher that looks over them on the island.The music played throughout the film is basically classical, so it gives it a disturbing vibe- as if it's in the spirit of the game.This film could be classed as a bitter satire on today's Japanese society, but it's not to be taken too seriously, though there is more to it then students killing each other... could you kill your best friend?5/5",Battle Royale
33,MOscarbradley,A dubious 'entertainment',6,25 September 2008,"Think, ""The Lord of the Flies"", think ""The Most Dangerous Game"" and you are still not a fraction of the way there. This Japanese horror movie puts a fairly large class of overgrown school kids on a deserted island and 'the game' is that they have to kill each other. There can only be one survivor or the adults, presided over by a somewhat stone-faced Takeshi (Beat) Kitano, acting as if it's all some kind of in-joke, will kill them all.It isn't a very novel sci-fi premise but it is very gripping, if often very unpleasant, and always extremely violent. However, I watched it on a day when there was yet another school massacre, this time in Finland, and while I oppose censorship I did wonder if perhaps films like this aren't actually promoting violence? (I still don't believe any film will make anyone go out and kill who isn't already predisposed to do so but sometimes the glorification of violence on-screen might just be the catalyst that might tip someone over the edge).Since there is no real artistic merit in ""Battle Royale"" it can hardly be argued that the film's morale is that violence is 'bad' and can only lead to bad things. Kinji Fukasaku's film is 'an entertainment' and a very dubious one, clever certainly and directed with some skill, but also very, very nasty.",Battle Royale
34,Pjtaylor-96-138044,They're not hungry and this definitely isn't a game.,7,26 August 2019,"Perhaps remembered mostly for its controversial worldwide release (or lack thereof), this turn-of-the-century dystopian thriller can't be wholly classified by its shocking violence. Though the bloodshed in 'Battle Royale (2000)' is indeed startling (not least because it's given and received by high-school students), it's always in service of the picture's story. This story is often overlooked - though, clearly not by 'Hunger Games' writer Suzanne Collins - and, even, dismissed in an attempt to label the piece 'dangerous' or 'violent for the sake of it'. In actual fact, the film simply allows its dark premise to play-out properly, never shying away from its palpable and saddening consequences. It's not supposed to be nice; in fact, it often feels like a horror. Besides, it never feels as though it's relishing in the violence it portrays, usually coming across as rather empathetic for its focal teens. The diegetic central conceit and those enforcing it are constantly considered antagonistic. The movie is a surprisingly nuanced affair, though. Even the despicable 'bad guy' gets some decent, and quite enigmatic, development. Much of its value comes from the in-the-moment suspense inherent with good survival fare. Placing two, sometimes three, cooperating teens together in a single 'winners' spot is an interesting way of maintaining tension. The pacing sometimes lags a little but there's not much wasted time, with the almost ensemble-like structure doing a great job of conveying the entire situation. It helps that, essentially, all the actors are fantastic in their various, well-rounded roles. Usually, the flick is rather entertaining. It can be a quite tough watch, in a way, but it still provides several more 'fun', albeit somewhat melancholic, action sequences. 7/10",Battle Royale

As for the film, kids killing kids is a pretty tough story line to admire, but I admit I liked it for its tension and gleeful audacity. One moment that stands out early on is when the two girls on the hill use a megaphone to try to get everyone to make a peace pact, and then get machine-gunned from behind. There may be a statement in this, or the idea of the adults putting kids through this barbarism, but the film is more about relentless violence than deeper meaning I think. I thought the flashbacks were effective in making us understand the various characters, and the casting, from the cruel teacher (Takeshi Kitano) to the fierce girl named Takako (Chiaki Kuriyama) is excellent. Quite entertaining, albeit in a conflicting way.",Battle Royale

37,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,8,13 August 2012,"Battle RoyaleTypically, not having a seat belt on the school bus is the most dangerous part of a field trip.But having no restraint during a collision pales in comparison to the brutality that the classmates in this sci-fi film experience.While on a school excursion, a group of Japanese students are unknowingly drugged.When they gain consciousness, the students (Tatsuya Fujiwara, Aki Maeda, Taro Yamamoto) discover collars around their necks that will detonate if they are unruly or try to escape.Given provisions that include a lethal weapon, the children are released on to an island where only one of them will emerge the victor.As controversial as it is fascinating, this adaptation of the notorious novel explores humanity's animalistic tendencies through the means of children, garnering disturbing results.Despite all of the carnage, however, this blood sport isn't as grisly as the battle to get into a decent college.

38,ironhorse_iv,"Battle Royale is one of the most disturbing film, I ever saw. A bleak commentary on the dark side of humanity and society. Worth checking out.",8,21 November 2013,"This movie is one chilling controversial movie when it came out in 2000 in Japan. I first saw it in 2002. While, the movie is set in a dystopia alternate modern day timeline, somewhat mirrors pre-World War 2 Imperialism Japan. It's speaks a lot about modern society, and the dangers of authoritarianism. What, Director Kini Fukasaku and writer Koushun Takami couldn't predict is how much the movie and book of the same name (1999) would end up, gaining up a huge following over the years, as its controversial source material, become more tamed as modern society's trials and tribulations of youth become more complex and dangerous. While the movie's savage, sharp, satirical nature seem more over the top, then realist. Real life youth tragedies has since pop out more frequently after this film released, allow viewers to question and metaphoric interpretation, why is movies about kids killing kids appealing? In my opinion, it's just that brutal fact. School shootings has become more and more common, as adult hood has become more stressful and multifarious. Films such as Battle Royale, and 2012's Hunger Games are popular, because they are society commentary on how dark our society has somewhat become when violent has become more appealing in nature. Films like this when it first came out, wouldn't even get much screening. For 11 years, the film was never officially released in the Americas, as America in the early 2000s were going through the 1999 Columbine High School massacre syndrome. Since school shootings are more common, more people are willing to see a film like this. I would have to disagree with some critics of this film, as they say that this is a mindless gratuitous violence film, as I see it as allegorically brilliant as a satire film. Not only does the film lampoon how badly the modern education systems is run and how badly parenting has become to the point, that young children are raise into competitive and exploitative employment markets to the point that your fellow man doesn't matter. It's symbolism in nature of how the film government force children to kill each other. The movie is smart as it deals with the consequences of nationalistic socio-political policies. The movie is brutal, yes, but the film does show a story of humanity put into the stress of a life and death struggle as it core. Throughout the film, we get flashbacks of the characters who are forced in these dire straight, as we find out that each one of them has gone through somewhat emotional trauma event that allow them to survive for so long. Not only that, but the film shows that the reason why some of these characters live so long, isn't because of hatred, but love. Love for the one they care about. People do cry when their friends are kill. People do suffer from mental breakdown to the point that they are willing to kill or willing to kill their selves. Emotionally do come out, both in the positive and negative extreme edges. The film doesn't get too depressing, as it leaves off more humanity than we came into the film. While, the film somewhat follows the book, the film's story could need a little more explaining. The film feels like the book in a blender, as there were some big changes made in admitting it. Most of it, was change for the better. The film tells the story of Shuya Nanahara (Tatsuya Fujiwara) a high-school student whom class was forced in this death tournament by their ex-teacher, Katano (Takeshi Kitano) and the BR Act, which was passed after 800,000 students walked out of school as a sign of society rebellion and also due to the increasing rate of violence and delinquency being perpetrated by the youth of Japan. With his class mate/ love interest, Noriko Nakagawa (Aki Maeda) he seeks a way out of this mess by taking the game head on with the help of volunteer Shogo Kawada (Tara Yamamoto). One could argue that the character of Noriko and Shuya are the model students who manages to uphold their high morals and ethics throughout the film thus illustrate the audience's deeply held cultural clichés concerning Japanese youth. Brazen, mute transfer student Kazuo Kiriyama (Masanobu Ando) and sadistic classmate Mitsuko Souma (Kou Shibasaki) are antithesis of that same thought. I think they made Takako Chigusa (Chiaki Kuriyama) more brutal than Mitsuko. All the acting is pretty good, but due to the language barrier is seems over the top acting, which probably was a little bit. It's hard to detect tone in their voices. Most original copies are not dubbed in English, but they do have sub-titles. The music speaks better than the language. I love the use of classical European music, even if it's doesn't add anything to the Japanese theme. Giuseppe Verdi's Requiem 'Dies Iraes 1"" as the opening score is amazing. The effects are somewhat mediocre. The blood splattering is little too fake cheesy to be real. Did Battle Royale influence Hunger Games or did Hunger Games rip off Battle Royale? Yes, but the same can be say about Battle Royale being a rip off or influence by Running Man, Lord of the Flies or The Most Dangerous Game. Battle Royale is follow by 2003's Battle Royale II: Requiem that follows somewhat near the same formula. The movie is still banned in some countries due to its violence. You can find this movie, a lot easier now on the internet and a DVD was release in the America, after the fame of the Hunger Games films. A special edition of the film was released after the original which has eight extra minutes of running time with more metaphors requiem scenes. There is also a 3D version that came out in 2010, worth checking out.",Battle Royale
39,sol-,The Hunt,6,8 September 2017,"Subjected to a government sanctioned program in which they have to hunt and kill each other, a group of high school students reevaluate their lives in this controversial thriller from Japan. Sometimes cited as a horror movie, 'Battle Royale' is actually more of a black comedy with an insanely peppy instructional video plus a demented deadpan performance by Takeshi Kitano as a former teacher who takes discipline to a whole new level while running the program. This black comedy edge is, however, not always present with the film taking some unwise dips into melodrama as teens recall crushes and friendships. With over forty students in the class, very few are fleshed out in depth either, which makes it difficult to get emotionally invested, and while the killing methods vary, there remains something repetitive in just watching countless teenagers die. The film additionally concludes with too many loose threads for its own good. For all its shortcomings though, the film still resonates in the mind long after it is over and with the way the teens are cheered on and encouraged to kill one another, it is easy to see the film as a metaphor for a society that encourages young people to be ruthless in pursuit of their dreams. Kitano also has one surefire memorable final scene and his energetic acting keeps the film chugging along even if he only appears sporadically.",Battle Royale
40,Dr_Coulardeau,Amazing extreme violence pedagogy,10,22 February 2007,"Only the Japanese could have dreamt of producing a film in the line of Richard Bachman's Long Walk. To imagine a world in which young people are submitted to an extermination game in real terms is absolutely insane but absolutely cathartic. Insane because the game does not work. A survivor from a previous game does not make the game more interesting but injects someone into the game who knows how to cheat, and he does. Then there will not be one survivor but three and in fact the survivor from the previous game will in the end die on the way to the final escape and there will only be two survivors wanted and hunted by all police agencies in the whole country. They will survive, what's more a couple able to produce some born survivors, in a world in which survival is the rule. Only the Japanese can imagine a world that is reduced to this basic animal instinct, survival. This instinct has nothing to do with humanity. It is the animal side of human beings and nothing else. But the world imagined in this film reduces everyone to this basic need. The film also shows how this impulse becomes all-governing and all-possessing in such conditions. You have to kill first if you do not want to be killed. But you also have the conscientious objectors who will evade the game by committing suicide, and the real criminals who will make the game work properly because they will kill and force even the most reluctant into defending themselves hence killing. What's the real lesson of this film is that such a project can only come from the mind of a frustrated teacher who has been humiliated by the students. For him it is a vengeance that will in no way bring him any satisfaction : he will even lose everything in that game, his wife, his children, his family, his self-respect, etc. And the surviving couple will run away into the social jungle, hide away. And this has to be seen as a rewriting of the basic religious myth that we can find in so many civilizations, among others the Nordic with its Ragnarok, and the Semitic with the garden of Eden and Adam and Eve. They are ready to produce Abel and Cain and the eternal feud Cain will invest into humanity by killing his elder brother.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",Battle Royale

42,howard.schumann,A requiem for the end of dreams,9,29 August 2005,"In a futuristic Japan, millions are without work. Teenagers no longer regularly attend school and the educational system is near collapse. Students still dress in their neat beige uniforms but discipline no longer exists. To combat this situation, the government passes The Millennium Education Reform Act designating a class of ninth-grade students to be chosen each year by lottery and sent to a deserted island to fight each other until only one person survives. Based on a novel by Koushin Takami, Battle Royale, a film by the late Yakuza director Kinji Fukasaku, is a requiem for the end of dreams and a metaphor for the loss of innocence in a world that has forgotten what it means to be human.Though there are moments of black humor, the film is playing for keeps and the insanity of violence is shown in such uncompromising detail that it vividly reminds us that death is not a spectator sport, but a shocking and horrifying reality. The latest contest reunites 44 selected students with their teacher (Takeshi Kitano), a detached and ruthless resentful of the dwindling attendance in his classes. Each student is given food, a different weapon, a map, and a collar affixed to their neck that will explode if they try to remove it. They have three days in which to survive or perish. The children, forced by society to engage in a bloodletting ritual, all react differently.Some refuse to participate and plan to escape, some join with other groups for protection, some use it as an opportunity to settle old scores, a few commit suicide, and still others take it as a challenge to survive at all costs. Fukasaku captures what it means to be an adolescent with its sadness, bravado, and joy. Before she is killed, a teenage girl tells Shuya that she has always had a crush on him. Another boy facing death asks a girl if she will help him lose his virginity. Children are forced to live in an atmosphere of fear and distrust, having to look at their best friend as a potential killer. In this nightmare scenario, every morning they listen to the loudspeaker announcement by their teacher, about who is dead and how many are left alive. The actors cast are all around the age of fifteen and all are excellent.A blur at the beginning, we gradually get to know the main characters. Shuya Nanahara (Tatsuya Fujiwara) is a boy whose father hung himself and decides he will do anything to protect Noriko (Aki Maeda), the girl he loves. Kawada is a survivor of a previous contest, who Shuya and Noriko trust to provide them with a means of escape. In Battle Royale, the violence is overwhelming and the film raised a storm of controversy in Japan when it was first released. It is, however, not shown to numb our senses but to make us feel. Like All About Lily Chou Chou, a 2002 film about the effects of bullying in Japanese Junior High Schools, Battle Royale captures the effects of a social order that has lost its bearing.It is a fable but one that makes a coherent statement about the world we live in. In a world where 14 and 15 year-olds are forced into combat in African and South American guerrilla wars, where the proportion of childhood deaths in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is greater than adults by a ratio of 5-1, and where hundreds of children are killed each day in Iraq in the name of democracy, it is only logical to ask why our children should be overly concerned with the inherent value of life when apparently no one cares. In the words of Bill Marshall, ""It is only through the realization thatkilling is an abomination, no matter what form it takes or how it is described, that we can instill a conscience in all of our children."" Hopefully that lesson can be taken from Battle Royale.",Battle Royale
43,Tweetienator,Mediocre & Over-hyped for Many Reasons,4,7 August 2017,"After so much praise I watched Battle Royal - and well, I am one of the ones who just don't get it: cheap production, ueber-theatrical soundtrack, at top mediocre acting, and well, a not so clever and inventive idea as many people claim.Many viewers claim that Hunger Games is a kind of copycat of Battle Royal but let us get this straight:The movie originates on the novel Battle Royale by Japanese writer Koushun Takami - written in 1996. But I can remember two stories (!) of almighty Stephen King - The Long Walk from 1979 and The Running Man from 1982 (dystopian societies, ppl fighting for their lives in a game). Or what about movies like The Blood of Heroes (1989), Rollerball (1979) or Deathsport (1978) and and and. You want teens!? What about Solarbabies from 1986!? It is easy to see that the material of Takami isn't that original at all. Also, if I remember my history lessons right, there is something like gladiators in the times of the Roman Empire... If someone claims that Hunger Games is a copy-cat of Battle Royal every vampire movie after Nosferatu from 1922 is a copy-cat too;)Battle Royal is imo in no way (a) original as many claim and (b) all in all a poor to mediocre executed movie. A movie like Fight Club or Clockwork Orange is rightfully considered as a masterpiece or cult - original stories, excellent acting, excellent directing, excellent camera- work and setting and and and, but Battle Royal!? Objective and subjective it got none of that - it production and execution is non better than all those Italian horror productions of the 70s - the cheesy and sleazy ones. Battle Royal a masterpiece!? Nah. If you wanna watch some original sci-fi I recommend you to watch Zardoz (Sean Connery) from 1974. Last but not least, Hunger Games is in every way the better movie (or let's say version) of the theme ""dystopian society and gladiators"". Alone the performance of Jennifer Lawrence beats everything in Battle Royal - the acting of most actors in Battle Royal is just terrible bad. And to the gore level, well if I wanna see gory stuff there are lots of flicks which are way more gory as Battle Royal is. I guess Battle Royal is imo mainly overpraised by juvenile Manga-fans and Cosplayers and fanboys of Asian pop-culture-Kitsch (that kind of folks who think these Asian cos-or-whatever-they-are-called bands really play rock'n'roll - and no, they don't). And one day, after growing up, I guess they all will not understand, why at one point in their life, they thought Battle Royal is a good or brilliant movie.Last note: in a certain kind of way the movie is ""clever"" constructed as many men in Japan have certain fantasies about schoolgirls in short skirts - many Mangas are prove of this ""notion"" ;)",Battle Royale

46,Vartiainen,Brutal viewing pleasure,8,27 December 2013,"A movie that demands a second viewing for all the characters, details and nuances to really sink in. Battle Royale takes place in the near future where a authoritarian government has taken over and is trying to establish its hold over the nation by sacrificing its youths to bloody war games. Bread and circuses applied to modern society. It's chilling to watch young people give into bloodrage when they are met with unrelenting circumstances and the only way to survive is to become a cold-blooded killer, a monster.Battle Royale shines as a gore/action/horror film because of its vision. All of the teenagers are unique in how they look, how they act and how they operate. We travel across the island following different groups and individuals as they try to survive, kill and maim. All of them are interesting and the pacing is excellent, giving us small amounts of relaxation and quiet to reflect upon the horrors before the violence yet again surges.It's a well directed and acted film that look and sounds great. Pretty much the only nitpick I have is that the adult characters aren't that interesting. They are there to represent the real enemy, the government, but especially the ringleader, Kitano-sensei (Takeshi Kitano), is a bit bland. He has his moments, but compared to the dynamic designs of the students he doesn't exactly shine.Nevertheless, this is a great film if you like bleak and brutal action films filled with gore and violence.

Everyone is given food, water, a compass and one weapon, such as a gun or a knife. Various cliques form and the kids kill each other in every way possible. Bombs, Uzi's, shotguns and anything available is used in bloody sequences which becomes tiresome after a while. Controversy surrounded the release of Battle Royale, due to the use of children in an extremely violent movie. I need to care about the people I'm watching, and I never did, so no reason to sit through this slaughterhouse flick.",Battle Royale
49,freemantle_uk,The Japanese A Clockwork Orange,9,21 March 2008,"I personally love this film. The plot is simple but raises a number of moral issues, such as could someone kill their best friends and people they would have known they whole life.Japan had fallen into an economic crisis in the near future which resulted in mass unemployment and the schoolchildren become violence and uncontrollable and boycotting school. The Japan government take dramatic action and create the Battle Royale Act which resulted in one class being picked every year to battle each other to the death. The students all react in different ways, some accept the challenge and go on and kill they follow classmates, some kill themselves, others try to co-operate and break out of the Battle Royale and some just continue life as nothing happened. As the title of the review suggest this film has A Clockwork Orange feel to it, showing a dyspotic society and how horrible life could be. It shows the government loosing control of Japan's youth and the drastic action they take. The film is well acted, which a young cast, and a brilliant plot. It was very violence as expected with some fun ways of killing people. It also has some humour in it. I admit the ending is a little strangle, but it is still an excellent film.In my opinion Japanese and Korean cinema is some of the best in the world. They have good ideas and then to go for stories and themes that Hollywood films wouldn't touch.I know that Battle Royale isn't to everyone taste, but most people I know tend to like this film.",Battle Royale

The country is in a state of chaos, violence by rebellious teenagers in schools is completely out of control. The government hits back with a new law: every year a school class picked at random will be cast away on a desert island to fight it out among themselves. The rules are simple: it lasts three days, everyone gets water, food and a weapon and only one may survive. Then a class on a school trip is kidnapped. When they wake up, angry teacher Kitano tells them that the collar around their necks monitors their position and can be caused to explode remotely at any moment. This movie is action packed from start to end, never get boring, there something, new every second of the film.There so many memorable scenes, it had great acting from the whole cast.There was one scenes that did bother me, someone get shot 10 times and they get up with not struggle and phones and eat something and then pass out. I did have that scene a bit over the top and really silly.That is only bad thing I can say about this movie. it a must see movie before the remake comes out (if the remake dose get made, I really hope it dose not)I give this movie 8 out 10",Battle Royale

For me, it has the mentality of any slasher movie without the tension. Add to that the effort of reading subtitles and I think the hype about it being a cult movie is just a tad overplayed. Basic plot - schoolkids in Japan, in the near future, are more and more uncontrolled. The government, in desperation, passes the ""BR"" act that plumps a whole class, chosen at random by national lottery, on an island. Only one can get off and only if they manage to kill all the others. Duh . ..",Battle Royale
53,kluseba,Not as good as its reputation,8,24 October 2012,"As I am a big fan of contemporary Eastern Asian cinema, this film was introduced to me as a classic and when it finally saw its North American uncut release, I didn't hesitate to try this film out just to realize that this movie isn't as good as its reputation.The general idea of an isolated island that becomes the exotic location of a killing spree is nothing new but the competition factor between the students could have been rather gripping with a few intriguing characters. Sadly, most of the characters happen to be as thin and exchangeable as the simple story line turns out to be. Only the exchange students and the pitiless female student as well as the weird teacher happen to be intriguing enough to carry this film on. The persons that have been chosen as main characters are though not very profound and one isn't really concerned about their fate in the end.The movie starts with a lot of tension and explains an interesting short background story. In fact, this flick is filled with a few flashbacks but it would have needed more of this to gain some depth. After a while, the story gets predictable and redundant. One surely gets a few spectacular but also introspective killing scenes but the characters all die quite quickly and in rather similar conditions after the introduction phase. It would have been more interesting to include less characters in this film, to focus on their character development and to invent more diversified killing scenes.Another letdown is the end of the movie. It has a little twist that isn't that exciting but what disturbs me the most is that one of the evil characters that is shot to death suddenly gets up again, speaks a few senseless lines and finally dies in peace. In fact, many scenes in this movie feel somewhat exaggerated and surreal and keep this movie from being brutally intense. These moments simply lack of credibility and don't fit with the rest of the movie that desperately tries to appear as realistic as possible.Nevertheless, the film is entertaining despite its flaws and it clearly has inspired books and flicks such as ""The Hunger Games"" recently. For die hard fans of Japanese flicks as I am, this movie is worth out a try but apart of that there are way better contemporary Japanese movies than this one here.",Battle Royale
54,EVOL666,Do Not Miss This Film!!!,9,9 September 2005,"BATTLE ROYALE is one of the all-time great classics of the Asian action/horror genre. If you haven't seen this yet, stop reading reviews, go to your nearest underground video store and buy this immediately. This is a beautifully filmed and acted movie (Takeshi Kitano is brilliant, as always), with plenty of violence and action, as well as a truly intriguing storyline. Basically, a bunch of school kids are put on an island and forced to kill each other until there is only one student left. Of course the story is a lot deeper than that, but that's all you really need to know going in to it. I was shocked and amazed the first time I watched BATTLE ROYALE and it remains one of my all-time favorites. I love to show this film to people who have never seen any of the ""extreme"" Asian cinema - it turns them into instant fans. I haven't met a person yet who doesn't love this film. My only gripe is the ending, which I won't give away, but I will say could have been more dark and dramatic - but it wasn't bad enough to do any real damage to this otherwise perfect film.

57,drystyx,some grace in what could have been sick,9,18 August 2012,"In case you don't know the plot, it's about a survival game, where everyone in a ninth grade is forced to kill each other until only one survives.The choice of using girls in the game is very sick, but that's modernism. There is some grace to this film, however.It doesn't sell out to a large faction of IMDb, that of the beavis and butthead crowd.That's because the characters are pretty believable. They don't just charge in and start murdering each other, the way an American bubble boy would write this movie. Most of the characters do what they can to help each other.There is a ""comraderie"" in this Japanese culture that one could see in American science fiction of the fifties. It's too bad that ""comraderie"" hasn't existed in American since the late sixties.And that's what makes the film here work better than most such films. Most of the ""kills"" come through misadventrues and fear. The characters act very believable.There are two horribly evil people in this movie, one a participant in the game, and one complete sicko adult. Both are very one dimensional clichés of movie making. But it works, because they are a minority, and both deliberately put themselves into the situation. The situation is an invitation to sickos like these two.The other characters are much more three dimensional, and they are what keep this story going.This is much better than most movies of this sort. The two stereotypes are well explained, with one being an addition special to the group, and the other the local raving lunatic.Not so well explained is the ""motivation"" for the ""game"".Overall, it is the functional desire to beat the devil that these kids all have which makes this a top notch film. When one of the normal kids crack and goes kill crazy, there is a logical explanation of events that break down tragically. There is sadness here, but overall, for a normal person watching, there is mostly the anger at the maniac who plays God with these kids.",Battle Royale
58,TOMNEL,Horrific.,7,31 July 2006,"This is such a disturbing film. Because of school boycotting in Japan, they make an example of why not to do that by kidnapping ninth grade kids and making them kill each other and the last one standing lives. It is such a horrible premise, and it is done well, but it's just so horrible. I would give the movie an 8 out of 10, but the story is one that gets quite repetitive until the end. I like this movie and it managed to keep my interest even though it's in subtitles. With some movies the violence overshadows the story, but lucky for this one, the violence is the story.My rating: *** out of ****. 11 mins. Rated R for violence.",Battle Royale
59,Agent10,Stunning in its implications,8,20 August 2006,"Battle Royale may seem like some serial killers favorite dream, the plausibility of such an event is not too far-fetched. While the film took a rather extreme stance on what to do with nagging problems of discipline and apathy, the very idea of using violence to solve these problems seems rather realistic.It's amazing the book this film was based off of wasn't made by an American. Frankly, I'm ashamed as an American that we couldn't come up with something so feral and nihilistic. Are all of the daily dosages of violence and havoc not helping us? Have we lost our edge? Well, on a more serious note, BR was certainly something that opened my eyes. While the budget could have been better in order to add some more realism to the violence, the underlying message leads one to wonder just how far off these assumptions are. While we tend to believe that mankind could never do this to anyone, one needs to look no further than the wars, genocide and evil we partake in every day.But what really makes Battle Royale a disturbing film is the rather candid nature of the characters. While the shell shocked people were quite realistic, it didn't seem too implausible that adrenaline junkies like Kiriyama would enter in these contests just to experience the thrill of killing someone. Either way, I regard this as a piece of fiction, but like all texts that deal with the decay of society, this feels vaguely familiar.",Battle Royale

I expected it to be extremely gory but it really isn't at all. In fact I'm amazed it's rated an 18.The premise of the film is good . Forty kids forced into trying to win a game where the last one surviving wins but in practical terms it doesn't really work .Forty is far too many. People are bumped off in regular intervals but there isn't enough time to get to know them , so the audience doesn't get time to draw breath and to care . Despite it being two hours long it feels rushed and that's because of the numbers of deaths they are trying to fit in .I really wanted to like this film as much as other people but I have to be true to what I saw and that was a film that did very little for me which is a shame.",Battle Royale
61,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Haunting Look at Possible Future,9,6 November 2019,"This was a film that I got turned on to by a buddy of mine of isn't even into horror films. He said someone he knew who saw this and really dug it so he got a copy to lend to me. I was shocked by what I saw as I had seen some of the mainstream ghost films from Japan, but never anything like this. It was one that I ended up really digging, but it had been a decade since that first viewing. I had the chance to catch it on the big screen at the theater I'm member at as part of their horror 101 series, so I jumped at the chance. The synopsis is in the future, the Japanese government captures a class of ninth-grade students and forces them to kill each other under the revolutionary 'Battle Royale' act.We start this off getting up to speed with the fate of the world. The youths have gotten unruly and society is crumbling. It is decided that this new act would go in where they randomly select a class of students, put them on a deserted island with food, water and weapons. Their goal is to kill each other until there's only one left. That is where we pick up. A reporter is trying to get close as we're at the end of the most recent 'game'. There's a little girl with braces who smiles and she's covered in blood.It then takes us a class where Kitano (Takeshi Kitano) is the teacher. There's no one there when Noriko Nakagawa (Aki Maeda) shows up. On the board is written that they decided to not come to class today. Things take a turn when Kitano is attacked outside of the classroom by Yôshitoki Kuninobu (Yukihiro Kotani) with a knife. The teacher can't do anything and just leaves. Noriko picks up the knife though.Our main character is Shuya Nanahara (Tatsuya Fujiwara), who has had a lot of bad things happen to him. His mother left when he was young and one day he came home to find his father hung himself. Despite this, he's probably the only one who regularly attends class and is respectful.Kuninobu comes back to class when asked by Noriko for a class trip. The whole group is on a bus and we see that Noriko seems to have a crush on Shuya. Things take a turn though when he wakes up and the whole bus is asleep. The driver and a woman have gas masks on. Shuya is knocked back out. They all wake up in a classroom to find their former teacher with soldiers. It is revealed that they've been selected to participant in the next Battle Royale. Kitano hits and scolds his former students to get them to pay attention to the video that outlines the rules. This involves him killing two of them for not doing as they're told.With the introduction out of the way, they learn there are two transfer students joining them. One of Shôgo Kawada (Tarô Yamamoto) and the other Kazuo Kiriiyama (Masanobu Andô), both look quite dangerous and we learn that they're actually volunteers who have survived previously to make this more interesting.This game really plays on high school to the extreme level. You have couples and friends who ban together while you have those that are terrified so they're doing what they can survive. We also see that past traumas cause people to hunt each other and this also is an interesting outlet for students that have some deep seeded issues that they're now allowed to act upon without consequence. We also get the real life idea that some cannot handle it as well and take their own lives.With the recap out of the way, the first thing I need to say is that I don't mean to disarrange The Hunger Games, because I found the subject matter and the overall product to be solid. For Suzanne Collins to claim that she had no idea about this when writing that though is preposterous. If anything, she probably had no idea that the world would come to the point that it did where we could clearly see the truth of the matter as she definitely borrowed heavily from here. This actually is scarier though, as it is much more realistic in its possibilities.What I mean here is that the way the politics of my country, the United States, are currently going, I wouldn't be surprised if The Purge or something like this is enacted. Now I will say the common myth is that the current youths are outspoken, but they also seem less violent currently. It is more about getting their words online, at least according to those that oppose them. The society is in a place where if we keep going down the path, things like this would be possible.Something that impresses me here though is the giant list of characters we have. The class totals to something like 42 with the two transfers. Not everyone really has a defined character but if I'm honest, most of them do or they have a crew so you can distinctly tell who they are. Examples are like Shinji Mimura (Takashi Tsukamoto) who is into computers and is trying to end this game. Mitsuko Sôma (Ko Shibasaki) who is actually a dark horse favorite character of mine. There's an interesting back-story that is sad about her and this allows her to be viscous because of it.There are some issues to this though. An example is that we lose a bit of realism in that Kazuo barely seems like he needs to reload his gun. It also seems to have a bit of comedy mixed in as well. I don't want to go as far to say that it's actually funny, just some things that relieve tension. With a runtime just shy of 2 hours, it doesn't really feel like it though. It does build tension and actually makes me wonder if all of these kids, aside from one are going to kill each other or not. The ending is interesting and actually leaves it open for a sequel that can delve even more into the society of Japan as well as its effects of this 'game'.As for the acting, I've kind of already alluded to this, but it's good for the most part. I think some of the comedy comes from these characters if I'm honest. Fujiwara is really good as the lead. I like that despite all of the bad things that've happened to him, he's trying to make the best of the situation. I kind of see a bit of myself in the character and it makes me wonder what I would do if I was in this situation. Kitano is solid as the teacher. I actually feel bad that he wants to help these students, but they're just too unruly and he's given up. Maeda is also solid in support to the lead. Yamamoto and Andô add an extra layer here and I really like the creepy performance of Shibasaki. The rest of the cast definitely round out the film for what is needed as well as being distinct.That takes me to the last thing to cover which would be the effects. I think for the most part, they look pretty real. I've seen a couple of films from Japan, where they tend to make it like their anima or manga, where it is over the top. This one does have some blood sprays that you can tell aren't real, but it didn't really bother me. Overall I'd definitely say they look good and there's not much bad CGI to take me out of this. I do think we get some creative deaths and weapons as well. The film is also shot well in my opinion.Now with that said, this film is actually better for me on this second watch. This has a terrifying concept that could possible happen if we get the right leadership in place. On top of that, we have older generations who think that the youths are ruining things, despite not looking at themselves with some of the ways things were done. I do think that the acting really helps bring these characters to life and making them seem distinct enough despite how large of a cast we have. The pacing is pretty solid overall and I actually worry if despite the partnerships, they could kill until there's one. It is interesting as well to see the high school bullies and cliques coming into play with people being killed as well. The effects look real enough to add to the realism. The soundtrack didn't necessarily stand out, but it did fit for what was needed. I would say that overall this is a good film and I did definitely enjoy it even more.",Battle Royale

I just learned today that all the actors did their own stunts. Maybe that helped to play a role in creating this cinematic magic to life. Unfortunately most people know about those stupid Hunger Games copycat films but not this gem. Try as they may, Hollywood will never get close to replicating Battle Royale. Yeah, this film has tons of action and blood but it isn't about any of those things. It is about raw humanity. An unthinkable situation revivals the true natures hidden deep down in the darkest etc, etc, etc, blah, blah, blah this film is one of the greatest films ever made.

63,RainDogJr,Three long days,9,4 February 2008,"The film starts with this prologue: ""At the dawn of the millennium, the nation collapsed. At fifteen percent unemployment, ten million were out of work. 800,000 students boycotted school. The adults lost confidence, and fearing the youth, eventually passed the Millennium Educational Reform Act - AKA: The BR Act..."" The Battle Royale Act is a kind of challenge, where a complete class of students are kidnapped and put together into a desert island. The rules of the challenge are to kill all your partners if you want to be alive, because if there are more than one survivor, everybody will explode because of some collars.The script of this unique and disturbing film was based upon a 1999 novel by Koushun Takami that i haven't read but i want to because the story is so original as disturbing and always a film can't have all the essence of a novel. But anyway, i really like this film and the way the characters are. I mean, in the first meting with professor Kitano (Takeshi Kitano) when he explain the rules, you can see how different are from each other and in consequence they are going to play the game in many different ways. And i really like that part of the film, how everybody have their own interpretation of the game and the different type of personalities. I mean Nanahara (Tatsuya Fujiwara) is the classic hero protecting Noriko (Aki Maeda) and Kawada (Taro Yamamoto) is the veteran who knows everything about the game. The others secondary characters are unique too and i like how they create different environments to deal with this game. That part of the film, in the island, is very interesting and really great, the other involving a disturbing plan is very strange. For me the only thing that is missed is the story of Kitano, to know why he accept this job because we know that he was suffering the abuse of the students but for me he must have a dark past or be completely insane to accept a job like that.Anyway, the cast of the film is great with all the young actors and actresses playing difficult characters in a great way. But Takeshi Kitano steals the film with an excellent performance, surprisingly funny in some parts. ""Beat"" Takeshi is just the master. And this is the first film that i have seen of Kinji Fukasaku and i have a lot of desires to watch most of his filmography and also to watch the second part of this film.Conclusion: this film is great but definitely is not for all the audiences because contains some disturbing scenes and a very disturbing plot. I'm not surprised that this film was almost banned in Japan; i really recommend this film to anyone who loves Japanese extreme films because it is a fact that a film like this one could only come from Asia. 9 out of 10Region 4 DVD: is excellent that this film is released in Mexico and in a very good price ($3). No extras, just the trailer but in this case the film is the only thing that matters. I wish more of this kind of films were released in my country, specially the first films of Takeshi Kitano.",Battle Royale
64,Sandcooler,Ultra-violent Japanese gem,8,30 June 2011,"Japanese genre movies have the quality that they leave nobody indifferent. Whether it's positive or negative, they all leave a certain impression. ""Battle Royale"" is no different, it's a controversial movie but even the people who hate it can't deny that it has a beautiful, unbridled directness. This movie doesn't screw around, it's very raw and violent. It doesn't lose itself in redundant sub-plots or misguided attempts at being anything it's not, it's just a very straight-forward actioner with social comments brought in at exactly the right times. The protagonists are pretty bland, but that's not really an issue when the villains are so delightfully evil. Kiriyama gunning down unarmed girls just for the heck of it, not a lot of scenes that can compete with that. Mitsuko could be even better though, or maybe her scythe is just a way cooler weapon. Overall this movie fully deserves it's cult status. It also comes with a sequel, which I'm sad to say kinda blows.",Battle Royale

At 15% unemployment, 10 million were out of work, 800,000 students boycotted school. The adults lost confidence, and fearing the youth, eventually passed the 'Millenium Educational Reform Act'...AKA: The BR Act."" 42 ninth grade students are taken to a small isolated island with a map, food and various arms. They have to fight each other until only one is left, and they only have 3 days to do this. Each student is locked with an explosive collar that will go off if messed with, when the three days are up, or if they are in a danger zone.Where do I begin, this is one of very few movies that makes you feel like you are actually there. I've never had so much fun watching a movie like this. It grabs you by the throat in it's first ten minutes and doesn't let go till the very end.Early on in the movie, you get the jist of things and pick your favourites to win, regardless of the main characters. This movie is so extreme that it makes you think from the very beginning that even the two main characters, Boy #15 and Girl #15, may die at any point in this film.Each character in this movie is given a bag, that contains food, water, a map, some female supplies (for the ladies of course) and a random weapon, and when I say random, I mean RANDOM. The weapons range from an Uzi, to a pot lid, and everything in between (paper fan, tracking device, coat hanger, these are their weapons). One poor kid was stuck with boxing gloves. The tag line for this film is ""Can you kill your best friend?"" Honestly, I don't know if I could. But here teams are formed early, your computer hackers, you're female cooks and your ""gang"" and you can bet your ass that they are all friends.After each death, there is a countdown on the screen. ""Boys # 7 #8 are dead, 35 to go"". Even the teacher, who is mostly the comic relief in this intense film, reads off the death list and the order they died in, just before telling each student what part of the island is a danger zone. The danger zones in the film, add to the suspense, the thrills, the excitement and overall carnage that takes place on screen. Because of these danger zones, you know that the students must always be moving somewhere, or else the collar will explode, ripping their throat open and gushing blood. Which happens early on in the film, just to show you what you're in for.The music is beautiful, the opera sound and opening are perfect for this film, it blends so well with it's tone and the atmosphere surrounding the students.It's always great to be sitting there cheering for characters, wanting others to die and crying for ones who do. Having this kind of fun in a movie is once in a lifetime. One part I do not get, but had me laughing saying WTF...When the Teacher was shot, then his phone rings and he all of a sudden gets up to answer it.It's easy to see where Kill Bill got lots of it's scenes from. This movie will stay in the history of film as one that will shock viewers upon first viewings. If you go into this movie to have fun, you will not be disappointed, if you look deep enough, you will see the politics within it, but for now I will leave that chapter closed, and just leave you with the fact that this film is a must see.",Battle Royale
66,lewiskendell,An incredibly pleasant surprise.,8,4 November 2010,"""What idiots. We might have all survived.""How to even begin to describe this? It's like Lord of the Flies meets Hard-Boiled meets any of the countless anime about high school kids battling each other. Very violent, very un-PC, very entertaining, and very Japanese.The story is simple. A group of disrespectful Japanese ninth graders are chosen by the government to be drugged while on a trip and sent off to an island for a kill or be killed battle royale. The only way to survive is to be the only living student by the third day. Some of the kids try to resist and band together to find a way out of this deadly game, while others immediately take to all the killing and mayhem. Either way, the results are usually the same: a lot of violence and dead bodies. And some genuinely sad moments, as well.Battle Royale is easily one of the best action flicks I've seen this year. All the shooting, explosions, and double-crosses, mixed with frequent talk about crushes and other normal teenager stuff, is just surreally awesome. I'm seen this kind of stuff in anime tons of times, but to see it in live-action takes it to an entirely new level. The pacing is excellent, there's nary a dull moment to be seen, and the carnage is frequent. This was one of the rare movies that I didn't want to see end.

Picture a Japanese John Hughes 80s teen melodrama directed by a drunken Stanley Kubrick adapting Lord of the Flies as a pulpy spaghetti western, and you've got a more accurate gage of what you're in for with Battle Royale. The passion project of (70 year old!) Kinji Fukasaku, Battle Royale is the kind of film that can be read into with as much depth as you like – analyzed as a scathing socio-political critique, or just enjoyed as a pitch black comedy, with all of the hyperviolence and meticulous score-keeping of a video game. Either way, for those willing to stomach its excesses and (largely willful) swathes of stupidity, it's a bonkers and surprisingly worthwhile ride. It is a bit tricky to get a gage on how trashy or sophisticated Fukasaku is trying to shoot for, as the film blends both in a curiously messy, but usually surprisingly functional fashion. The premise of this dystopic Japanese government wrangling its rebellious youth (here depicted as country full of a conservative's hyperbolic nightmare of juvenile delinquents) into a sadistic death game is at once flamboyantly ridiculous and inefficient, and yet a sparkling parody of the convoluted machinations of government (and, do I detect a wink at the Chinese ""one child"" policy in the rumblings justifying the BR Protocol as assisting with overpopulation? Hmmm!). This is no The Running Man, though, as the teenaged bloodbath is not televised, but isolated to a deserted island (a slick ""out of sight, out of mind"" jab at a culture glorifying violence yet loathe to face up to the grisly actuality of it). Here, Fukasaku has a ball paradoxically juxtaposing the beauty of his island scenery with the grotesque mayhem that ensues upon it, as the teenaged angst and melodrama soar as the body count escalates. Just as unstable as everything else in the film is Fukasaku's treatment of violence itself. It's over-the-top, but not excessively fetishized - think a more dispassionate Kill Bill - making it difficult to determine whether to gleefully cheer the combat on or cringe. Sure, there are crowdpleasing moments (naturally the film's two psycho-killers have a showdown, and there's a bit where a kitchen full of eerily cheery girls tear each other to pieces which is oddly cathartic in its actualization of unspoken tension), but each massacre is always slightly too gory to not provoke some reflection in even the most insatiable of gore-hounds. Meanwhile, the immediate nonchalant readiness with which the majority of the students throw themselves into the ruthless murder game is really all the media violence commentary you need. At one point, a few of the students band together, advocating for pacifism, only to be massacred for revealing the position. Fukasaku's response? Their teacher (Takeshi Kitano), who provides wry running commentary throughout (roughly functioning as Fukusaku's mouthpiece within the diegesis), issues an airy ""too bad"" as epitaph. Enough said. Either way, it's perfectly provocative and uncomfortable - probably precisely what Fukusako intended. The cast are all well on Fukasaku's paradoxical wavelength, melodramatically alternating between silly and sombre, and keeping the audience on their toes. Tatsuya Fujiwara grounds the proceedings well as pathos-riddled protagonist Shuya, and Aki Maeda is precociously amiable as the indignantly pacifist object of his affections. Kitano wins some of the driest laughs (as well as some moments of curious, unexpected tenderness, covering a student mourning her slain friend with an umbrella in the rain) as their grumpily world-weary teacher, while Tarô Yamamoto is stoically fun as hard-edged survivor Kawada. Savagely clever or vacantly tasteless? Tactfully silly or clumsily melodramatic? It's still up for debate, but regardless, Battle Royale is a curious spectacle. It doesn't quite warrant its morbid hype, but it's darkly amusing and has more going on than its blood-spattered, school uniformed exterior would suggest. If nothing else, Fukasaku has unleashed, in many ways, the definitive film encapsulating the high school experience in all its histrionic, violent melodrama. If you thought Mean Girls could have used more grenades and samurai swords (and, let's face it, who would disagree), Battle Royale is the film for you. Just don't mention Katniss, lest you find an axe indignantly hurtling through the air towards your head. -8/10",Battle Royale

69,Prashast_Singh,Welcome to Asian action cinema.,10,28 July 2020,"Battle Royale is an outstanding, original, impressive Japanese action film that manages to convey a number of strong messages without compromising a bit of the action/violence. There are movies that skip action and emphasize on dialogue to deliver a subtle message, and then there is Battle Royale which conveys so many subtle messages in spite of being filled to the brim with action: not something every filmmaker does, and that's its biggest achievement, in my honest opinion.If you never heard of it before, it's never too late. Welcome to Asian action cinema.The film is gripping from the very beginning, i.e, the R-15 disclaimer making it clear that the film isn't meant for young viewers. It's true that it isn't, but by today's standards, the level of shock is a bit lower. So, most of the violent action didn't seem excessively disturbing at all. BR is very fast-paced and not a single second is wasted. Every bit of it is rewarding, and it manages to be intriguing without even relying on heavy CGI. The whole film is one big action sequence with several conversations and flashbacks as well, and through this pattern we're given a story where we get to know each and every prominent character well.This is the film that led to creation of the battle royale game genre. It has to hold a special place for gamers, but even as a non-gamer, I found myself enjoying its intense action, fast-moving screenplay and realistic performances. I wish I could buy a copy of this movie, and add it to my collection. It's the most refreshing action film I've seen this year, and that alone should confirm the film has passed the test of time and still holds up pretty well.",Battle Royale
70,baumer,A frightening look at how society is deteriorating,9,30 April 2007,"Michael Douglas was a massive star in the 1990's. He had won an Oscar for Wall Street 1987 and he was the maverick and unpragmatic cop having kinky sex with Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct. He was on top of the world and could pretty much choose whatever script he wanted to. But in 1993, he chose a small film directed by Joel Schumacher about the decay of society called Falling Down. In it, he played a man who had lost pretty much everything from his wife, his job, his family and his dignity. One day while driving home in Los Angeles traffic, he just snaps and decides to walk home. Along the way he encounters racism, xenophobic, anti-Semetics and just plain jerks. He ends up starting a private war against society and those that exhibited these kind of traits. And so the line was drawn and then the question had to be asked. Who was the bad guy here? D-Fens (the Douglas character) or those that went about their business but practiced all kinds of malicious and sometimes Draconian behavior. Peccadilloes can start out harmlessly enough but soon they can turn into pernicious transgressions that have ramifications on everyone. Take away enough from one person, how can they not ""fall down?"" Falling Down is one of the most precocious films to come out and it is certainly a film that is timeless and can be shown now just as well as it could back in 1993.Why am I talking about Falling Down in a review about one of Japan's all time grossing films? Quite simply, they have a lot in common. Both films are scary in the sense that they see things that perhaps the rest of us don't. Society is built on anarchy. We aren't told that of course. We are led to believe that laws and morality are there to make this a better place to live in. But apparently in Japan, there is such a problem with their youth that many parents and law officials have complained very publicly about this impediment. And this impediment is growing exponentially. Laws are now created so that you cannot discipline your own kids. Lift a finger at a 10 year old and they'll threaten to call the police on you. Try to take something away from them and they throw tantrums. This may be a Japanese film but it speaks to all of us. And to 30 something guys like me who grew up when not only could your parents spank you, but so could teachers, although this film is clearly a purely fantasy type film where nothing like this could ever condoned in real life, this puritanical form of recourse must have come from someone who simply had enough. Enough of being told that you can't discipline your own kids anymore. Enough of being told where to go and how to get there from unruly kids who know too much of what the law can do to parents who step over the line.Battle Royale takes place in Japan where the government has decided that the kids are so much a problem now that once a year, they basically kidnap 40 or so school kids, ranging in age from 10 to 18, and then stick them on a deserted island and have them fight to the death. For those who choose not to fight, the incentive to do so is a collar made of explosives. Take it off, it explodes. Fiddle with it and you have no head. Not be the last one standing after the allotted time? Well, you die as well. There is to be one person standing at the end of the ""game."" If there is not, everyone dies.During the ""competition"" the young students still display emotions of teenage angst, young love and fear of the unknown. It is one of the strangest dichotomy of emotions as the students must kill one another but still have no control over their teen aged fears and concerns. Besides the violence in the film, this is where it excels the most. You get to know many of the students in the film and when they many of them inevitably die, its tough to watch.Battle Royale generated some very undeserved controversy. It's not so much the violence in the film, it's the ideas behind them. To imagine a government actually instituting such a law that punishes kids whose only real crime is adolescence, is quite disturbing. But as mentioned before, this is clearly fantasy and not a real idea. But I'm sure that the novelist, Koushun Takami must of had difficulty with his kids or seen others that did and this is his rebellion against them. No one is advocating or condoning this dystopian, tyrannical and intemperate solution the government has deemed acceptable. But if you get past all of the embellishment this film imbues, then what you are left with is a piece of art about the dysfunctional state that our world seems to be in. I guess it doesn't matter if it's North America or El Salvador and Japan. People have problems with their kids. This is not a solution. It's not even a band aid. If this were allowed to take place then you would have more problems than you started with. But at the same token, it is a plea. It will probably lost on today's youth, especially here in North America as many of them are too truculent to grasp what the film is trying to say.Battle Royale is highly impossible, wholly unrealistic but in terms of the idea behind it, it will be one that stirs the emotions and gives you plenty to talk about at the water cooler, or even better yet, with your kids.9/10",Battle Royale

75,carbuff,It's a Japanese thing.,9,25 November 2018,"""Battle Royale"" is a borderline horror flick that every serious film buff should see as long as they're comfortable with realistic extreme violence. I'm not a religious person, but when people say stuff like ""we all worship the same god"", they really don't get how different some cultures are from ours. It's hard to see this movie coming out of anywhere except Japan-it's simply a cultural thing. (I've watched a lot of excellent Asian films, and they seem to come in some pretty distinct flavors, such as Chinese and South Korean. Frankly, I think that nowadays Asian films are often far superior to Hollywood productions. For anyone who actually thought ""The Departed"" was a good movie, watch the original ""Infernal Affairs"" and see how it's really done.) In my experience, nearly everyone who has grown up with the Abrahamic religions (Jewish, Christian, Muslim) really don't get how differently people think in other parts of the world. For instance, the Shinto religion in Japan is to me completely non-Western and their fundamental outlook on life is hugely different, even though they are, obviously, still human beings and their behavior is ultimately due the same basic biological drives. I watched the first installment of ""The Hunger Games"" (I'm not a teenage girl and will never bother with the others) before seeing this movie, although I knew about this movie and that ""The Hunger Games"" was basically fan fiction derived from it. This film is just thoroughly harsh stuff right up until the very end, at which point it lightens up a little bit and tries to deliver some kind of message (although I'm not exactly sure what it is). To be honest, this film is just so ""Japanese"" it's hard to relate to, but it made for a film experience that I and a friend of mine really enjoyed having as a one-off, pretty much exactly how I feel after a good horror movie.

76,juliankennedy23,Like Schoolhouse Rock Meets Dawn of the Dead,10,8 April 2005,"Battle Royale: 10/10: Another classic is born. A fantastic combination of classical music and ultra-violence like a Japanese Clockwork Orange. Here is one Japanese film the major studios will not be remaking anytime soon. The plot consists of a junior high school class sent to a deserted island, given weapons that vary in usefulness, and are ordered to kill each other. Oh and they have those exploding collars that are ubiquitous in sci-fi films today so if they don't kill all their classmates everyone dies. The actors are actual kids and the film turns the bloody up to eleven. Add in child suicide, child prostitution, patricide, and worst of all basketball and you have yourself a winner.Battle Royale falls solidly in the category of Dawn of the Dead or Kill Bill where it transcends its obvious pulp and horror appeal and says larger things about life as a whole.But who am I kidding non-stop action, hot chicks in schoolgirl outfits, very dark humor and a great classical music score. Kind of like She's All That if Freddy Prinze Jr. killed a classmate every two minutes then had his head blown off by remote control. Throw in Anna Paquin dismembering Rachael Leigh Cooke with a fondue fork and that should give you the picture. Man that movie would rule Sorry went all fan boy there for a minute.

77,cchase,"Having A ""Grade-School Crush"" Never Killed Anybody...Until NOW!",9,5 December 2008,"It's to the credit of the amazing late filmmaker Kinji Fukasaku, that even though the quality of the DVD I watched it on really sucked butt-pucker, BATTLE ROYALE still turned to be one of the most unsettling and riveting experiences I've had watching any foreign film, horror or otherwise. And that's even counting CITY OF GOD and PAN'S LABYRINTH!The bracing, shocking result of what you'd get if you crossed a Japanese version of BEVERLY HILLS 90210 with LORD OF THE FLIES and THE RUNNING MAN, BATTLE is set in a bleak near-future Japan, where unemployment is at an all-time high, and close to a million students are running wild, boycotting classes and generally telling their elders to 'piss off'. In a jaw-dropping attempt to restore order, the government has created the ""Battle Royale Act"", passing it into law. This law calls for the random selection of 40 ninth-grade school students who are drugged, whisked away to a deserted island off the Japanese coast, then given an array of weapons with which they must kill each other in order to survive. Every student is fitted with an exploding neck bracelet that will detonate if they ""misbehave"" or wander into any designated ""danger zones"" which will set them off. After three days of carnage, if more than one student is left, the collars will still be detonated, killing the remaining survivors, so they have no choice but to fight to the death. You'd think from the sound of it that this film is far too derivative of other films to be good or even mildly interesting, but that's where you'd be wrong. As much as it's about bloodshed on a massive scale, BR is also irresistible for two reasons: the featured cast is not made up of twenty-somethings trying hard to pass for grade school students, but are actors who actually are the ages of the characters they're portraying.The other reason is because where other films of this kind might have the students wiping each other out indiscriminately, here the development of the characters has carefully been integrated into the scenario. Realistically, everyone reacts to the situation in a different manner, and most surprisingly of all, they do so in the same way they would if they were still in school, more or less. Certain cliques stick together, while others fall apart; some couples remain together, even in death. Some unexpected alliances are formed, while some classroom rivalries take on a deadly new dimension.Plus an emotional and heartbreaking layer is added; as each student dies, either by suicide, accident or at the hand of someone who might have even been a friend once upon a time, the BR number and name is shown like a gruesome scorecard, along with a flashback of some event in their lives that led them to their fates, whether what happened to them was happy or not. Also shown is their epitaph, which usually fits the person who said it.It's pretty long at just over two hours, but it moves with an amazing speed, as you root for some characters and hope that others die first. Front and center is the alliance/romance between Shuya Nanahara (Tatsuya Fujiwara) and the girl he's had an unrequited crush on, Noriko Nakagawa (Aki Maeda), who was also admired from afar by his best friend. Unknown to anyone until it's far too late, a crazed 'ringer' contestant, Kazuo Kiriyama (Masanobu Ando in a chilling performance) has been thrown into the mix - a kid who enjoys murder just for the sheer pleasure of the kill. And the responsibility for putting this maniac in the game falls squarely on the shoulders of the students' mostly unsympathetic teacher, played with gusto by top Japanese writer, director and action star Takeshi 'Beat' Kitano, (who starred in a hit remake of ZATOICHI).Also worth noting is a striking turn by Chiaki Kuriyama as Takako Chigusa, who treats the murderous contest like she would a school election, mowing down the competition while barely ruffling a hair on her pretty head. Is it any wonder that Quentin Tarantino selected her to play Go-Go Yubari in KILL BILL? It's deeply affecting to see how these kids, who were wasting their lives as rowdy delinquents, now won't even have the chance to turn themselves around. Their lack of experiences are usually only revealed at the moment of their deaths - boys and girls who never had their first kiss, their first date or even the chance to tell someone how they really felt about them...and now many of them never will.It isn't very often you get an emo-teen drama mixed in with what's very nearly a pubescent snuff film, and the fact that it can mix the two genres without missing a beat is amazing. All the while, the stunning photography and the use of classical music in contrast to the mind-bending violence gives it a very ""Kubrickian"" flavor, which is probably just what director Fukasaku intended. Now I just need to get hold of a copy that had a more even sound mix than this one had, (where the music nearly completely drowned out the dialogue), and subtitles that led me to believe they were added in Japan, since apparently the translator's second (or even third) language wasn't English.Having said that, I strongly suggest that anyone who thinks they've seen the best sci- fi/horror/thrillers that Japan has to offer, needs to check out BATTLE ROYALE, and I mean YESTERDAY!",Battle Royale
78,ajs-10,"Notorious, but surprisingly good...",8,15 May 2011,"I had never heard of this film until I got more seriously into films a few years ago. It's a film that has gained some notoriety since it was released and, having finally seen it, I can see why. Not only is it very violent, but the violence is being performed on, and by, teenagers. I liked it a lot, it has some great ideas, if controversial, and it's a really well made film.In the near future society in Japan has broken down. Teenagers are out of control and to combat this the government brings in the controversial 'Battle Royale' act. A class is selected and they must go to a remote island where they are forced to kill each other off until there is only one left. They have three days to do this or they will all be killed. So they don't just run and hide, they have been fitted with a special collar that not only gives the people running the project their location, but can be used to kill anyone in a changing 'danger zone'. With all this explained, they are released one by one with a pack that contains a random weapon, this might be a gun if they're lucky, or maybe a fan or a pair of binoculars if they are not. To spice things up, a couple of 'ringers' are also participating, these are particularly dangerous individuals. As the 'game' unfolds, some go it alone while others band together and some even just give up and commit suicide. But there must be a winner and as the numbers diminish it gets more desperate for the survivors.The film mainly concentrates on two individuals, Shuya Nanahara and Noriko Nakagawa, who don't want to get involved in any killing, but can they keep to it? They are later joined by Shôgo Kawada who has his own reasons for being there. The proceedings are overseen by their teacher, Kitano, who is not a man to be trifled with in this situation.Although there is quite a lot of violence, I was surprised at how all of the deaths were handled. It's certainly different to the way a Hollywood studio would have done it. very good performances from all of the major players; Tatsuya Fujiwara as Shuya Nanahara, Aki Maeda as Noriko Nakagawa, Tarô Yamamoto as Shôgo Kawada and Takeshi Kitano as Kitano.I loved the use of western classical music throughout this film, it fitted the images really well and gave it a bit of a quality that I really enjoyed. As each death occurs graphics on the screen tell the audience who is gone and how many are left, another touch that I really liked. It is a film I would definitely see again and one, for those that like this sort of thing, I can highly recommend.My Score: 8.2/10",Battle Royale
79,FilmOtaku,Lord of the Flies with an arsenal!,6,6 April 2005,"Kinji Fukasaku's film ""Batoru Rowaiaru"" (Battle Royale) is based on Koushun Takami's novel and features a pretty frightening premise. It is the new millennium and Japan is in a state of near-anarchy. Students in particular are running wild; making their teachers' lives hell or skipping students entirely. In response, the government enacts a new law called the Battle Royale Act in which randomly chosen classes of students are drugged and taken to an evacuated island. When they wake up, they have electronic collars around their necks and are told by their teacher that they must spend the next three days hunting and killing one another. The last one standing survives and is able to return home; if there is more than one student left, they will all die when the collars around their necks explode. The students are all given random bags with food, water and one ""weapon"" enclosed. The weapon can be anything from a pot lid to a machine gun. In this particular ""game"", of the 42 classmates, the two students we see the most of are Noriko (Maeda) and Shuya (Fujiwara), a girl and boy who have obvious feelings for one another and don't want to kill anyone, they just want to figure out a way to get off the island alive, and together. Alternatively, the other students are all subscribing to Darwin's theory and doing what they have to in order to survive and make it off the island alive; this means forgetting friendships, even love affairs. Most are reluctant, but there are a few who immediately adapt to the circumstances.I can't believe I'm about to say this, but I was actually surprised the film wasn't more shocking or violent. Obviously, seeing (mostly) innocent teenagers being killed is shocking, and the deaths were definitely violent (I'm not sure how an ax to the head couldn't be) but I think I was expecting just a little bit ""more"" I think. That's not to say that the film wasn't good; I thought that the premise was very interesting, and it definitely is an interesting social commentary in the same vein as William Golding's ""Lord of the Flies"". The film also had a satisfying ending, though it wasn't what I expected out of a foreign, particularly Japanese film.""Battle Royale"" is definitely violent, but it's not so over the top that the average viewer is going to get turned off or sick over it (I don't think). The story alone is interesting enough to look it up; I just honestly think that I had the unfortunate occasion to hear some preliminary reviews from people I know that said it was just intensely violent and shocking, and when it wasn't, I was a little let down. Truth be told, that is probably a good thing, and I'm the psycho for being disappointed with a mere above average level of violence in film.

81,Libretio,"A masterpiece, not to be missed",9,24 December 2004,"BATTLE ROYALE (Batoru Rowaiaru) Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound format: Dolby DigitalHelmed at the age of 70 by veteran director Kinji Fukasaku (MESSAGE FROM SPACE, VIRUS), this astonishing film posits a future world in which youthful rebellion has descended into violent anarchy, leading to social meltdown. Under new laws designed to deter Japan's wayward youth, a class of high school students is chosen at random and dumped on an uninhabited island where they're forced to kill each other until only one remains. Based on a novel by Koushun Takami, the screenplay (by Kenta Fukasaku, the director's son) focuses on one of the participants (teen idol Tatsuya Fujiwara) as he struggles to come to terms with the savagery and betrayal of his former classmates.This ultra-commercial shocker - a huge success in Japan, and a cause célèbre on the international festival circuit - literally explodes with vitality and action, establishing the characters within moments of their on-screen appearance and then stripping their emotions down to the core. Some of the participants resist their mission and die horribly, while others take to it with a fiendish lack of inhibition, and Fujiwara struggles to survive the onslaught with only a few trusted allies for comfort. Death lurks around every corner for these hapless teens, as old allegiances are tested to breaking point and former friends are torn apart by long-standing jealousies and resentments, leading to outbreaks of hideous bloodshed. As you might expect, the film's action and violence is vividly realized by a director at the peak of his powers (the editing and cinematography are razor sharp), but Fukasaku allows his cast of disaffected youngsters ample opportunity to reveal the human impulses which make them what they are; for all its scenes of horror, this is *not* a film which treats death lightly. Fellow director and TV personality 'Beat' Takeshi Kitano (BOILING POINT, VIOLENT COP) takes top billing as a former teacher assigned to oversee the 'Battle Royale', but it's Fujiwara who dominates the film, struggling desperately to retain his sense of moral justice at a time when a *lack* of integrity could mean the difference between life and death.

Without this movie, there wouldn't be Fortnite, Hunger Games, Alice in Borderland, or Squid Game.If you think the millennials and Gen Z are going to ruin the future, chances are you are just like the Japanese government in this movie that wanted to reform the young adolescents by having them brutally murdering each other.

It got me excited because I expected myself to be entertained by all the gore and violence.For the most part, that was what I got. Kids just died left and right. Sometimes it was pointless to remember the characters' names because I knew that they were going to be toasted. However, my major problem was the cast that played the high school students were so overdramatic that it's kinda cringe at times. The ways some characters died were laughable. What's blatantly exaggerated was how characters got shot, but still moved like they were normal.Interlaced with all the killing was the themes of courage, loyalty, and defiance. The main characters were loyal to each other and had the courage to fight back. When the government became too strict and expected people to blindly follow it, you know there will be defiance and those that would fight back. These themes and others were explored pretty okay in the movie. I don't think they were deep enough to make a high impact.Overall, still an entertaining flick that many consider as a major influence. 7/10.",Battle Royale
84,Superunknovvn,"Just plain fun... but with a ""message""",8,22 April 2002,"Some will watch this movie seeing it as some kind of critizism on the cruelty of modern world or whatever (there are a thousand possible ""meaningful"" interpretations), others will just watch it for fun to see the high number of brutal deaths - and of course there'll be a third group who'll just watch this movie to complain about its brutality. Me myself, I think that this was a very interesting variation to the ""Lord Of The Flies"" Theme. And one thing has to be said: despite its high body count ""Battle Royale"" never seems like some kind of gory ""Friday The 13th on Elm Street"" splatter-movie but is very well done and thrilling 'till the very end. I enjoyed the film very much and I can't wait to see more by its director.",Battle Royale
85,Movie-Misfit,"Brutal And Haunting, Yet Highly Entertaining!!",8,4 June 2020,"Still as dark, violent and entertaining as the day it was released, Battle Royale needs no introduction as it took the world by storm, inspiring a number of rip-off's (with one being, The Hunger Games) and was banned for some time in certain countries. Legendary director Kinji Fukasaku was definitely the right choice for this brutal tale of society gone wrong, and a country in turmoil, with classrooms of teenagers pitted against each other on an island in a fight for survival - kill or be killed!Fukasaku delivered so many amazing movies over the years, and I felt his style really worked with the story and darkness of Battle Royale. Had this been in the hands of a younger, more modern director, I think we would have had something completely different though not in a positive way. If ever there was to be a remake, I can only imagine that the amazing Takashi Miike would be the right man for the job...With unapologetic violence, intrusive cinematography, and lots of screaming melodrama, Battle Royale stands its ground today as one of the most talked about, and fantastic films from the turn-of-the-century. With a fresh faced cast, including the highly successful Tatsuya Fujiwara (Death Note 1& 2), the twisted Chiaki Kuriyama (Kill Bill) and the handsome Sosuke Takaoka (13 Assassins), and of course, the wonderful actor and director that is Takeshi 'Best' Kitano as their no-nonsense teacher.While the film offers an amazing amount of violence, there is worse out there. I think the fact that it is innocent school kids dishing it out, is the main reason for many people bashing its content. The same kids carry each role beautifully, caught up in a deadly moment in their life that must seem so surreal to each of them, forced to kill friends in order to live. Some even go as far to partner up in suicide to avoid having to hurt each other. It's haunting, realistic in its performances, and shocking!Compelling and brilliant, yet simple in execution, Battle Royale is a show stopper and Kinji Fukasaku's last full film...Overall: Brutal yet entertaining, Battle Royale is a must-see film from Japanese cinema!",Battle Royale

Brutal, cruel and hard to handle, but brilliant, visionary, influential and necessarily violent. Yes, I love adjectives.

88,Blue-Grotto,20th Anniversary!,7,24 December 2020,"Battle Royale (Japan, Kinji Fukasaku, 2000) - ""When someone is talking,"" says the middle school teacher ""shut up and listen."" Thwack! The unruly student gets a knife to the head for whispering out of turn. Many more students will die like this.Chaos grips the nation and authorities are done with the havoc in schools and disrespectful students. One class awakens after being drugged to discover they are on a deserted island with the teacher that one of them had stabbed months before. The students wear indestructible collars programed to explode if tampered with or rules are disobeyed, and they are surrounded by soldiers. The orders are that the students must kill each other until there is only one of them left. They have three days to do it or all die at once. Two young gangsters (""yakuza"" in Japanese) smile confidently in the back and are introduced as new transfers to the class. Each person is given random objects or weapons including pistols, bow and arrows, axes, grenades, binoculars, poison and machine guns. Welcome to class!The more you understand about Japan the more you will enjoy Battle Royale. One thing that might seem strange to an outsider is the loudspeakers. Loudspeakers are all over the place in Japan and whether you are in the country or the city you will be subjected to irritating ditties such as Edelweiss and taps blared at high volume at 6 am every morning. The teacher taunts his former students via the loudspeakers and if I were him I'd just play Edelweiss nonstop.Battle Royale is a wacky, fun and riotous cult classic. It is character driven so the acts of violence differ according to personalities as well as weapons. Battle Royale is more brutal and visceral than the similar themed Hunger Games. It is also considerably cheaper to make than Hunger Games and so the acting, special effects, and translation suffer. Takeshi Kitano, the star of many yakuza films, makes for an imposing middle school teacher. One of his students supposedly had the guts to stab him. I'd sooner stab Dwayne ""the rock"" Johnson. Despite all the slashing, Battle Royale has some depth to it and one theme is the importance of friendship and love. Three and a half of five stars.",Battle Royale
89,Darkside-Reviewer,"""Why not kill? Everyone has their issues""",8,17 August 2020,"The first time I saw Battle Royale was in 2012 after I started watching more Japanese movies mainly in the J-Horror genre especially movies by Hideo Nakata. One thing that caught my interest about the movie is that it stars a young (Tatsuya Fujiwara) who is one my all time favourite Japanese actors and I was very interested in seeing him in an over the top Japanese action movie like Battle Royale and I wasn't disappointed.The story takes place on an abandoned island where an unlucky class of 42 students have been selected to take part in a free for all Battle Royale against each other until only one survivor is left standing. The students are each fitted with a collar around their neck which will explode if they attempt to remove or tamper with it in anyway or if they try to flee the island. Each student is given a bag at random which contains a map of the island, a compass, basic food and water and a random weapon which could be anything from a pot lid to a fully automatic machine gun. Their are no rules only a time limit of three days if a winner has not been declared by the end of day three all the collars around the students necks will explode killing them all. Only one student can survive friends will turn on each other and innocent high school crushes become deadly in this game of Battle Royale.Battle Royale became a very controversial movie upon release due to the pure amount of violence throughout the movie which included scenes of high school students killing each other in various over the top ways like cutting off a young boys head with a Katana then stuffing the dismembered head with a grenade and throwing it through a window. The movie was banned from theatre's in certain countries like the UK but it's popularity only increased with the movies release on DVD which even with certain scenes cut from the movie it is still a very violent and bloody movie.The practical effects for the deaths are actually very well done especially by early 2000s standards as most movies at that time were starting to include more and more CGI scenes that haven't aged well at all. There are a wide variety of deaths in the movie although admittedly most of the deaths are via gun shots every death still looks amazing and is unique in style.(Tatsuya Fujiwara) performance in Battle Royale is definitely one of the best and most memorable performances of his career and was also one of the only actors to return for the movies sequel Battle Royale II: Requiem released in (2003).I highly recommend Battle Royale to any fan of Japanese action movies especially if you enjoy over the top violence with lots of blood and gore.",Battle Royale
90,TalesfromTheCryptfan,A modern classic!,10,15 May 2006,"In the near future, high school students are protesting against the school system as the adults begin to worry, thus creating a special program called ""The Battle Royale Program"" in which students who are selected at random must go on a island armed with weapons as they must be separate to hunt and kill each other until one remains to become the winner.One of the most controversial movies in recent memory is a wild and ultra-violent Japanese Sci-fi action thriller inspired from a infamous novel from it's native country has broke Japanese box-office records and stirred up some trouble over there on the subject matter and on the politics over there. The story is very intriguing with futuristic ideas and some social issues thrown into it with graphic violence and gore with it to keep the viewer entertained, the company who made this movie called ""Toei Studios"" refuses to have this theatrically distributed in the U.S. but is in many countries and the only way to view this movie for U.S. viewers is to get a import DVD mainly a R0 one.The movie is a powerful, unique and disturbing epic beyond anything you have seen before and is a must see movie.",Battle Royale
91,LoneWolfAndCub,A powerful and disturbing movie,8,23 October 2006,"This film carries one of the most extreme taglines I have ever heard of: ""Could you kill your best friend?"" This poses an extremely confronting and daunting question for many, including myself. I personally could never, ever do such a thing, but are do my friends feel that way?? That's one of the many themes and situations that are brought up in this outstanding Japanese horror/black comedy. Kinji Fukasaku has made one of the best films of the 21st century. This movie is easily one of, if not THE most, daunting, confronting, disturbing and controversial movies made.The Japanese society is becoming increasingly violent. Students are dropping out of school and becoming criminals. To put a stop to this, the government put a new Act into place, the Battle Royale Act. A Year 9 class are selected to participate. Basically, these bunch of students are pitted against each other in a battle to death. They have three days to kill each other, the last person standing gets to leave the island alive.This, for me, is a very uncomfortable movie to watch because of the subject matter. To think that these 9th graders are actually put through this hell is quite horrific. It makes the movie that much more involving. The violence is harsh and in your face. It's rough to watch, but dealt with professionally so it isn't a joke. It's all the more disturbing because the characters are so likable and well-written that we don't want them to die (well, most anyway). Some of the deaths are quite tragic. The actors really put all their efforts into their roles to make them that much more interesting.Many will think this is straight out horror, but there are definitely some comic elements to it that are really quite funny. That may seem disgusting but it is relevant to the message the director is making. How does the government solve violence.....with more violence. (That's not the message, but I think it's a great thing the movie has going for it).I recommend this to everyone except people with weak stomachs or someone who hates horror/black comedy movies.4/5.",Battle Royale

I see more and more every time I watch it, spotting different things I hadn't seen before.1stly don't think of this as a foreign language film with English Subtitles. It surpasses the fact that you have subtitles to read to follow the plot. That becomes a natural part of your movie experience.I think some of the English translations are a little weird so the characters end up saying some slightly unusual sentences where things don't always make sense.The film is about a world in the near future where school children have decided anarchy is their weapon against the world of adults. the adults pass a law that allows them to choose 1 class every year to fight against each other until 1 child stands alive.The winner is allowed to live, if there is no winner within the 3 day time limit then the players are killed by the necklaces they wear which are filled with explosives.With no stars in this film there are no egos and everyone works to the best of their ability.

93,asda-man,run!,10,1 July 2011,"""Battle Royale"" may seem on the surface to be just mindless killing of older children, however the genius of Kinji Fukasaku's masterpiece is the hidden message and impressive writing that lies their. In a similar way to Kubrik's ""A Clockwork Orange"" (as it's often compared to) it is a comment on a future society that's deteriorating, with youth's disrupting the world. From here the society props us a survival programme called ""Battle Royale"" in which students must kill themselves until only one survives.""Battle Royale"" is written to perfection. Why? Because one of the greatest things about this film is the way it explores the lives of students we don't even know that well and makes us care about them! This is the source to why the film is so utterly gripping (like the book I suppose). We have three main characters, but throughout this violent journey we're introduced to people who we haven't even seen before in the film and are made to care about them. It's pure genius writing that goes along with the spectacular visuals.Kinji Fukasaku's directing is brilliant. He follows the same Japanese formula for directing which mimics Tarantino's directing in the spectacular ""Kill Bill"". It really is very nice to look at right down to the lighting and effects. It is pretty gory, but could've afforded to be a little more bloodier but that doesn't really matter. Kinji Fukasaku takes us through the darkest side of human nature to thought provoking effect! he even manages to splash jet black humour in there which does actually work really well and sometimes to a metaphorical effect.Another thing I really adore about this film is the melodramatic music. It uses it in a similar way to Stanley's masterpiece ""A Clockwork Orange"" it's over the top and works to near-perfection.In the end this is a stunningly original film with a heart-felt message to give. All the aspects work to create a near perfect film with the spectacular screenplay, impressive directing and stunning cinematography. I sit here writing with a ""Battle Royale"" T-Shirt. Yeah, it's really that good.",Battle Royale
94,suspiria10,S10 Reviews: Battle Royale (2000),9,27 March 2005,"In the not too distant future the whole of Japan is on the verge of collapse. With their society in tatters and the economy hitting the skids as a last ditch effort they enact the ""BR Act"". The BR act is a tool by which the government reels in the unruly youth that are the downfall for society. The aim of the BR act or Battle Royale is to take a class of students, in this case 41 Ninth graders and set them on a deserted island with a map, rations and a randomly packed weapon to duke it out to the death. One can only remain after the 3 day tournamentor none at all. This wicked dark comedy has its tongue so firmly planted in cheek that it draws some serious blood. All the 90210-esqe cliques are here: the loners, the populars, the geeks and so on, they align themselves and try their best to stay alive or thwart the system. This movie rocks, plain and simple. It moves fast and there are plenty of evil laughs and grins to be had by all the violent happenings. It's a real pity that a distributor for the US couldn't be found. But I guess that's why man invented the all-region DVD player.",Battle Royale
95,ridi-arahan,So how much is not too much in our fight for survival,7,28 February 2021,"What worked:
The concept of the movie is very interesting so it made me curious to watch the movie. So, before hunger games or saw or any movies of this theme, this one seems to be an original idea at least for my viewing. This might have been practiced before in the movie but I had not watched one. So, the movie deserves the praise for the very unique and thrilling idea, and the movie with many death sequences.What did not work:
I think the movie might have worked for the time it was released but the movie as a whole did not engage and entertain me that much. One of the reasons being a weak character development and portrayal as a result we could not vouch for any particular character or his or her reasoning. This made it unidentifiable and we could not relate much with the characters. Also, the movie feels repetitive and monotonous after a point because of many killing scenes but without a cathartic value added to it. I would have wanted the movie to keep few death scenes and rather focus on the characters so that the overall impact during the action become enjoyable. That does not mean that the movie should be predictable or focus on few characters and leave others. The movie used many action scenes but without a believable reasoning or our command over the characters it felt flat.
Final verdict: recommended for the idea at least but not a great movie overall",Battle Royale
96,The_Light_Triton,Worst day at school ever,10,14 October 2019,"Imagine yourself at 14, maybe 15. You're with your 9th grade class on a field trip. Everyone's having fun, but then in a split second you faint and wake up in a room surrounded by armed gunmen, and you learn that you and your classmates have been chosen to partake in a game of life & multiple deaths.
Guess what? you just entered Battle Royale.
Set in an alternate version of the year 2000, Japan's government is facing a crisis of unemployment and recession. To motivate future students to behave, the government sets up a yearly event, known as the Battle Royale, where a class of students are chosen at random to participate in a battle to the death, pitting friends against friends, lovers against lovers, and forcing timid students to either submit to death or fight to it first.
To be honest, i spent the first 20-25 minutes of this film thinking it was going to be cheesy and i would laugh at the ridiculously exaggerated effects. Soon as Kitano pulled that knife from the girl's head (BTW this is a very messy film, but the mess is nothing compared to the story, which in itself, is absolutely terrifying.) it was like that scene from Jaws where Hooper laughs at Quint's tattoo and suddenly his laughter fades when he realizes what it's from. Everyone in that room either started screaming or crying. As soon as the kids were being called by the cute, bubbly lady from the videotape, that's when i really began to feel uncomfortable watching, and it did not let up until the end.
The acting in this film is superb, Director Kinji fukasaku knew exactly what he wanted. The students express feelings of fear, anger, sadness and insanity almost to a fault. Takeshi Kitano, who westerners know best as Takeshi from Takeshi's Castle AKA MXC from the former spike network, is superb. You can feel his apathy as he speaks to the students before sending them into the game, as a reflection of their apathy towards him.
What is strange however, is his relationship with Noriko, the only student to attend his class on a daily basis. The 2 seem to be closer than friends but not exactly lovers. It might be something a Gaijin (a foreigner) wouldn't understand because i'm not Japanese.
You will either enjoy this film by not enjoying it. It's a terrifying situation that no one would want to be in. It makes you question yourself as a person in modern, civilized times. If you were suddenly thrown into a game of life & death, how would it end for you?

97,loganx-2,"Modern Japanese ""Lord Of The Flies """,9,11 June 2008,"This is considered the apex of Japanese ""shock"" cinema, but this benefits from being based on a novel, and directed by an experienced and talented director Kinji Fukasaku. Fukasaku was old and near death when he decided to direct this, what inspired the decision was that Kinji was in a boarding school during the breakout of World War 2, and said he related to the book because he remembered, being abandoned by the adult staff, hiding in ruins beneath the corpses of other children. I'm adding this because a story which seems so fantastic to a lot of people, can be poignant and real to those with different experiences. That being said...holy s*&t! Holy s*&t was my first thought as I watched this movie, it was Lord Of The Flies, with arbitrary weapons and explosive collars. Between all the action is an immensely dark sense of humor (look out of the Godardesque in-titles), expressed through the children's immaturity and inability to comprehend the seriousness of their situation. Between the bullets there still 14 year olds, interested in crushes and clicks, which adds helpful drama and comedy to the constant mayhem.The shock of the premise gives way pretty early on to one well developed scene after the next, as the body count rises. Takeshi Kitano, plays the teacher master-minding the project, and plays one of the best casual villains to ever grace a screen.Not a movie for everyone, talks of the American remake were put on hold after the Virginia Tech shootings, and it's unlikely the mainstream of the states would accept a movie like this anyway. Highly competitive schools and high suicide rate, make movies like this and ""Suicide Club"" major hits in Japan and over seas, where the context makes more sense I guess. Anyway, believe the hype, if you get a chance see it.",Battle Royale
98,moviemanMA,Battle Predictable and Boring,4,7 July 2009,"What a disappointment this was. Right from the start I knew this wouldn't be quite what I thought it would be, but there was potential for a good film to come out of it. For starters, there is really no need for any of the back story since none of it comes into play. At least with the movie Running Man there was something else going on other than killing. Here there is just regular violence with some screaming and the occasional tender moment/flashback/tender flashback. The subtitles were embarrassing to read. You shouldn't find typos in them! Even if they were spelled correctly, it was still cheesy and predictable. There were also a lot of loose ends and unnecessary story lines. Nothing was shocking, nothing was intense, it was just senseless violence that led to a predictable and terrible ending.",Battle Royale

100,david-meldrum,"Undeniably Effective, Influential And Important",8,23 July 2021,"It's unfair on both films, but coming to this years after I saw the Hunger Games films it's almost impossible not to see them in light of each other. The influence of this film on so many others is clear, but it felt slightly more distanced for me than the American film - probably as result of both being so much films of their parent cultures, and my own cultural language being far closer to America than it is Japan. Battle Royale feels both slightly more heightened and a little more alien, perhaps dulling the emotional impact for me.But it still works well as a comment on the adolescent experience and the way adults view it as much as how the children live through it. The performances are good, and the direction allows the film to work whereas in lesser hands it might really be the moral threat to society some of the more hysterical say it is. Ironically, of course, this film is both truthful and important in a way those who'd decry it want it banned can't see, which probably only goes to make it more important.",Battle Royale
101,Gafke,Amazing & Inspiring,10,13 June 2004,"I usually only review horror films as a rule. I've been a horror fan since the age of 3, and not much else interests me. However, ""Battle Royale,"" usually classified as a ""drama/action/thriller"" is a huge exception. I saw this film for the first time just two months ago. I'd never read the book or the graphic novels. I didn't have the slightest idea what the plot concerned itself with. So it was without expectations or preconceived ideas that I sat down to watch ""Battle Royale"" for the first time. I was blown away.Battle Royale is the story of a not-so futuristic Japan, where the government has collapsed and order has become chaos. The youth is uncontrollable, boycotting school and running wild, defying authority. Fearing the children and desperate to keep some semblance of order, the remaining adults in power pass the Millennium Educational Reform Act, also known as Battle Royale. Once a year, a ninth grade class is chosen at random, drugged and brought to a deserted island off the mainland coast. Once there, they are forced to kill each other off. There can only be one survivor, otherwise everyone dies. The subject of this film is young Nanahara and his friend Noriko, a girl who likes him very much. They think they are on their way to a class trip, but they, along with their 40 classmates, are this year's unwilling contestants. Beat Takeshi is the embittered, sadistic and ultimately pathetic instructor in charge of the program. Thrown in with the 13 and 14 year old boys and girls are two slightly older boys: Kawada, a cold and guilt-ridden survivor from 3 years earlier, and Kiriyama, a sadistic and psychopathic (and good looking) punk, who enjoys killing and seems to have volunteered for the fun of it. The game begins (after an incredibly disturbing instructional video is shown to the children - save us from perky girls in camouflage) and the children are forced to make impossible decisions. The ones who don't commit suicide band together and plan a hopeless escape, or become cold blooded killers, desperate to survive. Mitsuko, the girl everyone picked on, quickly becomes the most feared next to Kiriyama, mercilessly slaughtering her victims with a scythe and barely a blink. A small group of boys with a laptop computer hatch a clever plan to escape with the help of a computer virus. And Nanahara and Noriko make an unlikely alliance with the dangerous Kawada, determined to survive together no matter what.The teenage angst is all too real here; death pales in comparison next to unrequited crushes and vicious rumors. Suspicion and paranoia kill more of the characters than any instinct to survive does, and only Kiriyama and Mitsuko seem to enjoy the killing...and one of the best scenes in the movie is the scene in which they have to battle each other. Only Kawada, Nanahara and Noriko stick together out of compassion and regret. Mature beyond their years, having been forced to grow up, these three are scarred adults long before their childhoods, and the film itself, are over. Caring more about each other than themselves seems to be enough to help them survive...even when they are faced with Kiriyama and Takeshi. This is a film about the death of childhood, and all of the innocence that goes along with it. In these days of youth gangs and desensitized kids, perhaps this isn't as shocking as it should be - not as shocking as the original ""Lord Of The Flies"" was - but it still makes a powerful statement. Kill or be killed..but what then? In a world populated by Kiriyama's, Nanahara and Noriko are the hope for the future, but they are few and far between. They are the Reasonable Ralph's pitted against the savage Jack (Kiriyama) and whoever wins will decide the future for an already sick and dying world.This is, simply put, an amazing film. The performances turned in by the young cast are flawless and believable and, though we cannot focus on every single character during a two hour time period, you still learn to care for them in the short time you are given to get to know them. You want them to survive and triumph and are devastated when they fall. This is not only the best Japanese film I've seen in a long time, it's just one of the best films I've seen in a long time PERIOD. There is nothing cool or glamorous in the various bloody and graphic deaths portrayed here; it is ugly, violent and cruel and often difficult to watch...but death isn't pretty, and this film never tries to pretend otherwise. This is a brutal, powerful and realistic story which never glorifies violence but instead shows the painful, nasty truth and the devastating aftermath as the kids weep over the dead bodies of their fallen classmates. Only by avoiding violence at all costs can our heroes triumph, and it is their compassion for every living thing, even their enemies, that inspires the viewer throughout.I can't say enough good things about this incredible film. Ten stars out of ten for this modern day masterpiece.",Battle Royale
102,Bogey Man,Very remarkable and challenging cinema,10,4 July 2002,"Kinji Fukasaku's Battle Royale is among the most controversial films of last years. It is based on Japanese novel that also was very provoking and ""shocked the nation."" The plot is simple: at the dawn of new millennium (the film is set in near future) nation collapsed and all kind of social menaces were born as students started to boycott their schools and act very violently towards teachers and adults in general. Unemployment number was alarmingly huge and everything was going to fall apart. Battle Royale act was created and it meant that every year, one ninth grade class was chosen by random to play ""Battle Royale"" which turns out to be savage hunting game in order to stay alive. The game is played in deserted island in the middle of the sea. The rule is that only one of the 40+ students is allowed to survive and the winner is the one who is last alive. They have 3 days time to fight and if there are more than one person alive after three days, everyone will be killed. They can't escape as they have deadly necklaces that explode if they try to rip them off or try to escape etc. do something that is against the ""rules."" The chosen ninth grade's teacher is played by Takeshi Kitano with his usual charisma and sense of very dark and wry humor. It is no necessary to tell anything more about the story since this is all that can be told without spoiling anything. In few words: a human hunting/killing game in which only one can be a winner. You may need to kill your closest friend or girlfriend if you want to stay alive..Well what a premise for a film we got here, and I must say the film is definitely as great and interesting - and very disturbing - as it sounds. I have seen this two times now, and it was even more powerful now that I viewed it again. The film says as many things about society as Clockwork Orange and both films have been hugely criticized by their violent nature and often off putting imagery, but that's also because of they show things most people don't want and dare to admit. Takeshi Kitano's teacher sums it all up pretty wisely at the end of Battle Royale as he says ""if you hate someone you take the consequences."" It is horrific to see how some of the youngsters are immediately ready to kill a friend and all others in order to survive the game and return to society/home. Others commit suicide because they don't want to get killed violently or, more importantly, they don't want to kill. And then there are those who only try to invent a way to get out of that island and get rid of the deadly necklaces.
This film depicts once again the darkest sides of humanity and what kind of things we are capable to do. These films are very important but due to their hard elements, they are often misunderstood and unaccepted, and so not understood. Violent scenes are usually the things that provoke certain people, and despite Battle Royale is very bloody, violent and horrific film it is never gratuitous, just merciless. And the world it depicts is also very merciless, so do you dare to watch to mirror? That is almost as appropriate ""slogan"" of the film as the present ""Could you kill your best friend?"" The film is full of totally gorgeous cinematography and camera use and the editing is also fantastic and smooth and never too fast, which is very irritating if used without talent. The film is pretty blue and dark for most of the time, and that is also great element to add to the depravity of the subject matter. The mostly young actors are very talented and never act irritatingly, and most importantly, their characters are deep and not shallow as in many films. These characters are all very personal and the viewer really cares what happens to them. For example the three protagonists are especially charismatic and natural, and Takeshi Kitano does his role once again with his usual talent and mastery of his face. The film would definitely not be this great if the script by Kenta Fukasaku (director's son) were more shallow and cliche oriented. The killing becomes far more disturbing as the script concentrates so much on these characters and the sorrow when someone loses his/her friend is hand touchingly effective.The soundtrack combines classic music to modern pop/rock and that is also another reason why this has been compared to Clockwork Orange which also used classic music to make the film stronger experience with the power of music. In fact, I've listened the song played during end credits several times, because it is very great song from some Japanese artist/group. I thought very much before this review that what NEGATIVE points I found in this film, but I have to say that since the photography is stunning, the characters are very deep (at least the main characters) and the subject matter is very important and handled with the magic of cinema, I cannot say any negative things about this, but if I get something in mind, I'll write them here with new review. I always think that if a film has many positive things and is cinematically stunning, the few possible ""flaws"" are easy to forgive, but in this case I really can't mention any flaws or negative things about this piece of Japanese art. Battle Royale is among the most important films of last decades and it is not a surprise it comes from Japan; from the land of masters like Takeshi Kitano, Akira Kurosawa and many genre directors specialized in unique horror and fantasy films. I give this Kinji Fukasaku's masterpiece a 10/10 rating and I am very pleased it was even more stunning experience with my second viewing.",Battle Royale
103,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,10,4 March 2005,"Without sounding like a fan boy the following is Fact. Battle Royale is undoubtedly the most important film of the new century, and quite simply, the best film of the last ten years. All those Oscar winners, modern classics etc are put to shame when placed beside this. Fukasaku's last film, banned in the US, Battle Royale, based on Takami Koushun's novel, inspired by others such as the Running Man, A Clockwork Orange and Lord of the Flies, is an intense experience and is the One film Everyone should see. The story is infamous now, 42 school students are placed on an island and forced to kill each other until one remains. If there is more than 1 survivor at the end, they are all killed. It is the Government's way of controlling the rebellious nature of Japanese kids. Each year one class is chosen at random, and taken off to an unknown destination. The winner returns. Not only a satire on TV, entertainment, education, politics, Japan, America, morality, mortality, it is more importantly a story about trust, loss of innocence, love and growing up. The final line of the movie? 'What would your parents say now?' The film begins with chaotic flashes of the new regime, of the BR act. We see the media frenzy it causes, the manic smile of a previous winner, a young girl holding a bloody doll's head. We get a flashback of a school, the pupils do not come, the teacher played by the great Takeshi Kitano waits. He leaves and is stabbed by a pupil, Nobu. Another pupil Noriko helps Kitano, but also hides the knife. Then we flash forward. The class is on a bus, going on a school trip. The pupils get up to usual antics, shouting, laughing, taking photos, sharing cookies, and generally having a good time. They are 14. Soon they sleep. When they wake they are on the floor of a room. They have metal bracelets around their necks. Scared, they are shocked as Kitano appears. There are soldiers everywhere. The kids try to be tough, but their new teacher has been killed- he was against the Act. Kitano explains what is happening, showing that he is the boss by killing two pupils. 40 left. An absurd video tells the kids the rules, and the game begins. The pupils leave individually, each getting a bag with food, water, map, compass and a weapon. Weapons range from guns to bombs to bin lids. There are cameras everywhere, if any rules are broken the bracelets are activated and the kid's head explodes. As each kid leaves, they begin to plan what to do-play the game, wait for their friends, hide, say their goodbyes and run. It becomes clear that the only way off the island is too win. They all leave, and the game begins.The range of characters here is awesome, never before have we had such a real sense of teenage school relationships. They are horny, some mistrusting, some too trusting, some clever, some reluctant to play, some bloodthirsty. Every performance is breathtaking, considering the actors are 14 or 15, and that this was for many their first role. Kitano is sinister, but we can see things from his point of view, his daughter constantly calling, showing him no respect, his relationship with Noriko. Noriko is the kind girl, quiet but strong. Shuya Nanahara vows to protect her as his best friend Nobu loved her, but is not here to do it himself. Mitsuko is an outsider, with a tragic and tormented past she plays the game. Chigusa is an athlete, in love with Hiroki, who is in love with Kayoko, but none of them have told each other their feelings. Shinji Mimura is a hacker whose uncle was a freedom fighter. Throw into the mix two wild-cards, exchange students Kazuo and Kawada and the game takes many twists. We see the choices they make-some could never play the game and kill themselves, often in heartbreakingly real circumstances. Others wait, hoping that everyone else will be killed, others gleefully join in, but we can understand each of their reasons and soon feel hatred towards the system which has forced this upon them.The violence and content caused the ban, but the truth is that the film is not very bloody or exploitative. The deaths vary, some are darkly funny, some very moving, others we believe are deserving. We grow to know the main characters, hoping they can find a way out, but know this is unlikely. The ending of the game is a shock, but there are still a few funny moments afterwards. Certain scenes will wrench your heart, as we watch best friends killing each other, and we are forced into thinking what we would do. After Columbine this may seem sick, but the film is anything but, placing the blame squarely on the older generation. The kids have their faults, but these are not worth being killed for. The lighthouse scene is one of the most tragic ever filmed, and it all seems so inevitable. The final scene involving Hiroki and Kayoko is moving and will make you understand that as life is short we should not let fear get in our way. Perhaps the most moving part is the basketball victory scene, we see Mitsuko begin to cheer, but slowly moves away, looking back, as she knows she doesn't fit in. The music adds immensely to the film, orchestra blaring, and the reference to Springsteen, about not giving up will stay with you even if you don't know the song. Filmed beautifully, and the island looks perfect, even though it is where they die. Thematically it has great depth, but it would take another 1000 words to cover the basics. This should be mentioned alongside Seven Samurai, Vertigo, Star Wars and The Godfather, as one of the best films of all time.",Battle Royale
104,InzyWimzy,Stunning cinema,10,12 June 2002,"This film had me from start to finish.I must admit that this movie grabbed my attention span by the jugular.  As it unfolds, I found myself following the progress of the game, almost like a someone watching a game show.  Besides the graphic violence, the human aspect was there and each child shows emotion ranging from anger, fear & paranoia, to regret, denial, & extreme malicious intent.  There are many characters and certain ones stuck out like Kawada, Mitsuko (one cute, but CRAZY chick!!).Overall, it's  a very thought provoking film.  Although not for the squeamish, Battle Royale is like nothing you'd find in mainstream American cinema....and that's a good thing.",Battle Royale
105,EthanBJones_03,The acclaim for this movie is unfathomable for me.,2,25 July 2017,"'BATTLE ROYALE' was directed by Kinji Fukashaku and stars Tatsuya Fujiwara, Aki Maeda and Taro Yamomato. ​42 9th graders are sent to a deserted island. They are given a map, food, and various weapons. An explosive collar is fitted around their neck. If they break a rule, the collar explodes. Their mission: kill each other and be the last one standing. The last survivor is allowed to leave the island. If there is more than one survivor, the collars explode and kill them all.I don't dislike this movie because I had to read subtitles. I'm not that childish. I just don't understand the acclaim this movie has received. Perhaps three solid performances and definitely a solid premise but, aside from that, I see little else to praise in this movie. Non of the characters are particularly interesting or likable and the plot is nonsensical and stupid.Expanding on that point, don't tell me I dislike this movie because I didn't understand the plot. It may have some Japanese cultural relevance that I am unaware of but until I find that out, I'm pretty damn sure I got the plot. And it is a stupid plot at that. I conceded the fact that the premise is interesting but the ridiculous plot and relationships between that characters they built around that is awful. The entire film hinges on the romance between Shuya(Fujiwara)and Noriko(Maeda) but I just didn't buy their romance. The simple fact I didn't like or empathise with either character did not help this movie either. Both Fujiwara and Maeda gave mediocre performances at best and where outshone both in performance and character by their co-stars.Taro Yamamoto gives one of the only good performances as Kawada, an ally to the two leads. Masanobu Ando gives the other decent performance as the antagonist in the arena. Arguments could be made for Takeshi Kitano also giving a solid performance but you see so little from him and get so little of his character that, at least for me, the jury is still out on him. These THREE people are the only thing that even remotely saves this movie for me. You may argue that I am being way too harsh on the movie considering I like both the premise and up to three of the performances were good and I would usually be inclined to agree. That said, when a movie fails to deliver on what it set out to do, I cannot give it pity points. This movie is supposed to be a sci-fi, but I would say nothing in it is particularly amazing or spectacular. It is also a thriller but I was never on the edge of my seat. It's not supposed to be an action movie but even that aspect of it was terrible. Attempts at comedy backfired. I cannot in good conscience recommend this movie. Mild entertainment at certain points saves it from complete disaster. And violence is not my concern. I was fine with it. It is everything else this movie offers up.I don't recommend you see this movie. I'll rate it a very disappointing(for me) 2 Efficient Dog Collars out of 10!",Battle Royale
106,kdnor2011,"Gory, enjoyable, well executed.",8,23 January 2013,"After ""The Hunger Games"" came out, it seemed that quite a few people were saying the same thing. ""It's just a rip off of Battle Royale."" OK, first off, other than a similar plot, they aren't that similar. But all that slander started pissing me off, so I finally saw Battle Royale on Netflix, ready to Nipick it to death. And while I did find a few issues with it, I couldn't deny that I really, really liked the movie.Big problem with this movie, the main character, Shuyna I believe his name is, is an incredibly boring lead. His girlfriend isn't much better, they are just bland, they aren't that memorable, and they don't really do anything. They tried to basically give every single kid in the entire competition at least one moment, each of them even got a name. Unfortunately I personally couldn't remember about 80 perecent of them. They try so hard to make every character memorable that not only does it make the main characters that much more uninteresting, but it makes most of the supporting characters forgettable. Also the backstory is really confusing, despite being simple. Why do parents decide to do this, I mean I know that Japan isn't the best place to live if you're a kid, but I don't see how parents would let this happen.But the reason this movie works is just incredibly well done action. This movie is a bloodbath, and a fun one at that. Most of the characters rely on the ""it's a kid, so you have to feel sad for them,"" but it still works, I felt sorry for most of these kids. The shock value is really high, but the gore never goes too over the top that it becomes comical. Like I said, most of the supporting characters are forgettable, but at least there are a some that I really liked, including the villains. I was actually terrified of the kid in the arena, he felt looked like he enjoyed doing this. The violence is uncut, non shaky cam, well executed, and thus the movie become enjoyable, a weird instance where you want the kids to live, yet still enjoy it when they die.Battle Royale is not the best film of the last decade, hell it isn't even my favorite foreign language movie, but it's a gory, well executed action movie that I recommend to anyone.",Battle Royale
107,in1984,Japan makes a 1970s Sci-fi B-movie 25 years late,3,25 January 2014,"3.25 of 10. Equivalent of a 1970s B-movie by Japanese filmmakers and actors. It could be called science fiction if it had been made even 10 years earlier. Now, it's simple an alternate reality, which is what a lot of films can claim.I watched this because of the massive amount of hype someone is putting into promoting this as the original Hunger Games. It's not. There's 1 similar element, the survive and kill or lose game, but the rest is a melodramatic piece of ""pro"" wrestling style action film with lots of teens in school uniforms.At best, you can say it's an interesting idea. Beyond that, superficial characters, acting, and an underdeveloped plot simply don't make the idea feel real at any point.",Battle Royale

Cringe.Yeah I don't know, I can see how this inspired the much, much worse and cringe-educing Hunger games too.Maybe a modern remake could make this cool concept justice, but this movie doesn't hold up.

Its full of immature content and childish soap opera in terms of reactance in romance and action. But nevertheless, a work to admire with spectacular violence, screenplay and individuality.",Battle Royale
110,Meven_Stoffat,"The scary thing is, this may be what our future could be in 20 years",10,19 March 2009,"Back in 2006 I found a bootleg DVD of this in a store in Chinatown at West Edmonton Mall. I had heard many good things about it, so I bought it and decided to give it a first viewing.After I had finished viewing it, I had been blown away completely by what an amazingly complex film it was. It took a disturbing idea that could really happen in some years from now and put it on screen. It had a disturbing and intense storyline, but also mixed it with lots of action too.In Battle Royale, Shuya Nanahara is a 15 year old kid in Grade 9, who plays basketball and the girls just dig him. His friend Kuninobu, who took him in after his father's suicide, hangs out with him on a daily basis. He goes on a trip with the school, which seems like a nice school retreat in the beginning, but finds out they're really deceiving the whole school.After being knocked out on the bus, he wakes up with 41 other students and finds himself in a Battle Royale, a game which lasts 3 days. The rule? Kill each other off until there's only one left! The students are given bags with sandwiches, water, maps, and a different weapon each. As soon as the game starts, everyone kills to stay alive, and Nanahara finds himself bonding with Noriko, a young girl, to stay alive. After a small incident, a survivor of a previous Battle Royale joins the pack and the three all fight to get off the island.Let's face it- Battle Royale is where it's all at. I'm sure every ninth grade (even those who hate reading subtitles) will love this movie. This movie is incredibly controversial as well, and has been rejected by every studio for getting an official release in North America. This will shock and disturb some, but yet I thought it was one of the most amazing movies ever made.This is NOT for everyone- people will think it's ""Cool"", others will think it's ""a brilliant social commentary"", and others will call it ""A pointless gore fest exploitation flick"".

111,Dockelektro,A bit of a letdown,8,23 August 2002,"Okay, the idea is interesting, and when you hear it you think ""maybe it can make a hell of a movie"". The score starts roaring and when you see Takeshi Kitano you know you're in a cool spot. Then the movie starts evolving in a little grotesque way, and the slaughter starts. This isn't really a bad movie, it has some clever ideas, although the main premise is a little too much fabricated to justify the on-screen violence. It keeps our interest flowing until the end, which is probably the greatest letdown of all with the usual minor plot twist. Altogether, it's an interesting experience, and has a sort of cult movie potential among gore fans. As I said, it innovates, but the result comes a little too confusing and sadly we don't have too much time to attach emotionally to these characters, because almost all of them die, some of them in a way that is simply too much. It succeeds in being a violence-fest, too bad they didn't have the sensibility to make it a little more than that. And that notion of linking terminal murder situations with love declarations comes as merely laughable. Watchable, but somewhat forgettable. It depends of your own tastes.",Battle Royale

113,Jacques98,Pretty typical. Nothing the US could make? You're joking.,3,30 August 2008,"I think from now on when someone asks me what a decent movies is, not one that will blow their minds, but one that will at least keep them awake, I think this is what I'll point to. It's not intense or emotional or all that original, but it's pretty solid. I only got bored a couple times.To this day I've yet to understand why people are so offended by teenagers/kids dying in movies. I'm 18, going into collage this upcoming semester, and the idea of me having to kill off my classmates 4 years ago doesn't strike me as any sicker than me having to kill off my coworkers in 20 years from now. Kids, adults: I see little difference in movies like this. Maybe it just simply boils down to the fact people are pansies.Which brings me to the argument of whether or not this film is meant/is cartoony. First, I already made the point the subject matter didn't disturb me anymore than watching SpongeBob Squarepants. The violence was not excessive or insanely graphicit was pretty much a gory action movie. The violence was certainly enough to earn an R-rating, but it was not pushing the limits by any means. When the ending scene comes it IS something out of a cartoon. Likewise, the opening scene with the video tape and the ""you don't respect grown-ups"" speech were both as cartoony as can humanly be. I think the over-the-top of the plot was enough to suggest that this is a bloody cartoon, and the scenes I just mentioned it conclude that argument.5/10Overall, if you look at it from a Saturday morning cartoon perspective, this is rather entertaining and fun. But if you're disturbed and set-off and are looking for some sort of deep social commentary and plot line, you're not going to find anything here.",Battle Royale

116,geminiredblue,High School Can Be Murder!!!,10,21 August 2012,"With the popularity of THE HUNGER GAMES (both the movie and the book series), many have looked to this Japanese film. And wondered ""Did they rip off BATTLE ROYALE?"" Having seen both recently, I can honestly say I see quite a few similarities between the two movies. However was Suzanne Collins, the author, inspired by BATTLE ROYALE? The debate may continue to go on. So, in light of this burning question, I'll review BATTLE ROYALE based on its own merits. Both movies have the same basic story: Once a year, young people are brought together and put into a fight to the death. The game ends when only one person is left alive. In BATTLE ROYALE, once a year a rebellious high school class is enrolled in a government enforced program called Battle Royale. Under the illusion of going on a field trip, the students are knocked out and wake up to find themselves on a deserted island. Each student has an explosive collar around their neck. They have 3 days to survive and kill each other. Only one student can be left alive at the end. However, if no winner is determined by Day 3, all the collars will explode. Each student is kitted out with a backpack that contains food, water, a map, a first-aid kit and a random weapon, then sent out into the wilderness. From that point on, we watch some of the most grueling, brutal and beautifully eye-opening death scenes ever filmed. The special effects are top-notch. Each character is completely fleshed out and we are allowed to sympathize. Overall, the film deftly combines elements of comedy, action,and horror films while also providing insightful reflections on the meanings of life, death and where each of us fits into it. I think one of the characters says it best near the end, ""While killing is easy, the choice to kill is never an easy one to make."" So, there you have it: a stellar cast, wonderful special effects and a gripping story. These same three qualities also best describe THE HUNGER GAMES. Did the one lead to the other? Who knows for certain? And why should it matter? In my opinion, get out there and watch both!",Battle Royale
117,Claptrap_Reigns,The times of Toei's awful exploitation movies in the 70's are back in full force in this atrocity,1,11 May 2021,"I have not seen something as badly acted, directed and plotted as this piece of utter poo since trying to watch Female Yakuza Tale and Terrifying Girls' High School a month ago. The characters are all equally boring and uninteresting, the acting is atrocious, several scenes are completely useless/cringeworthy and the premises not only don't make any sense whatsoever but they recycle other movies like the Running Man (again with the explosive collars?) and Rollerball, just with a cosmetic skin concerning youth. And, unlike the hilarity and over-the-top nature of the former, this one takes itself EXTREMELY seriously, which is just pathetic.Avoid this utter mess with no remorse, trust me.And If you want to know more about Japan's obsession with youth, watch any of the main mecha series by Yoshiyuki Tomino and you'll find far more value.

For me, this is where i started to watch them, and i'm sure anyone that watches Battle Royal today, will soon be watching more, not just 'the ring' or 'the grudge', but 'Audition', and 'a tale of two sisters'.There's no point in trying to explain this film, the film does that far better than anyone could put down in words, just watch it, and after, watch the sequel, which, although not as good as this, is also a great film.As the title states, i believe everyone, at some point in their life, should watch this film.",Battle Royale

121,mistoppi,"A lot of violence, a lot of depth",9,29 January 2016,"I've been meaning to watch Battle Royale for years. One of the reasons was strongly The Hunger Games -trilogy has been affected by Battle Royale, and for its cult status, and just for the sake of watching more Japanese movies.Battle Royale has several important themes it explores. There's the sort of selfishness, suicide, killing and survival - and if those things are good or bad in certain situations. And of course there's the big question on trust. If you are basically all out to kill each other, who can you trust? Can you trust a total stranger, or your best friend?The character's aren't introduced right in the beginning like this character is called Blah Blah and they do this and this. The audience learns what they need to know when they need to know it - which is one thing that makes me like the movie even more. Useless explaining is just boring, when important stuff can be revealed otherwise. The only character we learn more immediately is Shuya Nanahara, played by Tatsuya Fujiwara. And knowing about one character from early on is good, because that way we have someone we can at least somehow root for.The characters in Battle Royale are interesting. They are young, they have the kind of problems young people usually have. And then they should kill each other. It's interesting to see how some are ready to embrace that, while some are ready to do anything to avoid killing. Some are ready to kill only to defend themselves. It's good to see all different kind of reactions to their situation.The young cast of this film is incredibly talented. Tatsuya Fujiwara is amazing. I've liked him ever since he played Kira in those Death Note movies. And of course I'm in love with Chiaki Kuriyama. Her character Chigusa didn't have a lot of screen time, but every time I see Kuriyama in a film, she's astonishing.I love how music is used in this film. There are calm classical songs that are now ""tainted"" by the mindless violence in the film. Battle Royale is an amazing film. It's incredibly violent, yet it definitely has some depth, and it's not just mindless, useless action. If violence in films doesn't bother you, then you should definitely see Battle Royale - it's worth it.",Battle Royale
122,dcldan,Good movie,8,10 January 2007,"Some years in future, Japan lives a great breakdown: lots of people without work, the students don't respect the adults, riots everywhere. To solve the problem, government promotes the BR law: once a week a random class will fight with each other until only one student lives. This will not only be useful as a population control but also as a natural selection, as only the strongest lives. The movie is about one of the class that take part in the ""championship"". Many people has claimed that the movie has lots of nonsense violence and it makes funny about people killing each other. Well, it is true that the movie is violent, but not more than most Hollywood films (Bond, Seagal, etc), I expected more blood indeed. In fact, most of the students seem totally frightened about the situation and behaves in a very logical way: they make alliances to survive, they protect each other and some commit suicides as they don't want to play the game. Of course there are some that become sadistic and kill everyone the see but this is not the usual. In the deep side there's a reflexion about the society and the relation between parents and children and their lack of communication, but most people tend to ignore it at watching all the deaths of the film. Actors are quite good and the behaviour of all the characters is very well done. Every student reacts different and logical and the dialogues are typical of a 16-year-old teenager and a bit silly, though. One of the best things is the cast: it is not usual that the actors have the age their characters have (we are used to see 24-year-old actor trying to be a boy of 18), this makes the film more touching, due to the youth of the characters. In fact, a very good movie, but not for all tastes due to its violence and plot. In the extended version (1h more), most of the aspects and topics of the film are perfectly told, but it results too long for most of people.",Battle Royale
123,rparham,Controversial film that is neither disaster nor masterpiece,7,21 November 2012,"Released in Japan more than a decade ago, Battle Royale unsurprisingly developed a rather notorious reputation. Based on a manga of the same name, Battle Royale tells a tale of a near future in which juvenile crime is growing out of control, so as a deterrent, the Japanese government passes a law that one middle school class each year will be sequestered on an uninhabited island and the class members will have to fight one another to the death until only one is left. Battle Royale touches upon a number of social issues satirically, from modern youth culture that no longer respects its elders and society in general, to the idea that violence prevents more violence, but, while Battle Royale isn't without it's strong points, the film is a bit overrated by those who worship at it's altar, from my point of view.Battle Royale introduces us to Class B, students who are released onto the island with a bag of supplies, a weapon, and have an explosive collar affixed to their neck. Throughout the three days of the contest, various locations on the island are identified as danger zones, and if you are in a zone during a particular time, the collar will explode. If more than one person is left alive at the end of the three days, all the remaining collars will explode, killing all surviving students. The narrative eventually focuses on four main characters, Shuya (Tatsuya Fujiwara), Noriko (Aki Maeda), the girl whom Shuya has feelings for, Shogo (Taro Yamamoto),a ""transfer"" student who has survived Battle Royale once before at a grave personal cost, and Kitano (Takeshi Kitano) their former teacher who is now overseeing the game. Shuya, Noriko and Shogo form an alliance to try and escape the island, while other classmates alternate between forming similar partnerships or engaging in the bloodthirsty slaughter of everyone who stands between them and victory. Of particular threat is another ""transfer"", Kazuo Kiriyama (Masanobu Ando), who had volunteered to participate due to his predilection for murder, which he carries out with reckless abandon on any who cross his path.Whatever you may or may not think of the quality of the production, Battle Royale is sure to cause some significant debate as to its moral and ethical qualities. The very premise, schoolchildren forced to brutally kill one another until only one is left standing, certainly will raise emotions in some viewers, without a doubt. Whenever violence involving children is dealt with, the stakes of a film are raised automatically, and much of the controversy over Battle Royale in the last decade is due to this basic idea. While the twist of focusing on children is a new direction for this type of material, the basic concept is hardly original. In literature, from The Most Dangerous Game to The Running Man, in film from Rollerball to Death Race 2000 and beyond, humans pitted against one another for reasons of sport and entertainment to social control, as in this film, has been addressed before. By involving children, Battle Royale does put a different spin on it. These adolescents are dealing with not only the shock that their guardians, adults, would put them in this position, but also their changing emotions, dealing with the emergence of romantic love and standard torment of childhood bullying, which plays a significant role in the story. Some of these characters are transferring their normal reactions to the events of their teen years to a battleground in which the stakes no longer are hurt feelings or scorned lovers, but the end of a human life.While the ideas of Battle Royale's premise are intriguing, the film is hampered by its style at times. Director Kinji Fukasaku stages much of the film like a live action version of a Japanese anime. The various characters often overact to the hilt, and the over-the-top, hyper- melodramatic nature of anime is constantly on display. The various actors gasp, giggle, and react to violence with bug-eyed stares. It is difficult to believe that these choices weren't intentional, I wonder if Fukasaku elected to approach such horrific material this way to take a degree of edge off the proceedings. The film also suffers from the fact that with in excess of 40 students at the start, most of the them will not be given much development at all. The early deaths lack emotional punch because the people being killed don't mean anything to us. The film's primary villain, Kazuo, is also all style and visual menace. While he has a palpable threat to him, he represents death largely from a symbolic nature, not one of character identification. Kazuo exists to serve as a plot device, an effective one at times, but a plot device nonetheless.As the film moves along, the core group of Shuya, Noriko and Shogo come to the forefront, and as the story balances between them and a few key antagonists, the emotional resonance of the film becomes stronger. Kitano also is revealed to be less of a villain than a man who still holds out some degree of hope for a few of his former students, torn between his affection for them and his seeming belief that the Battle Royale act is a necessary one. While no one will mistake Battle Royale for a character drama, as the character count reduces and we can focus in on the main players, the film is stronger.Battle Royale is certainly worthy of it's notorious place in recent film history, you can't play with these kind of ideas without pushing some buttons, and while I would hardly describe it as a despicable piece of cinematic filth, I don't think I would side with those who have proclaimed it a masterpiece. The reality, as so often, is somewhere in between, but nevertheless, as with anything, the buyer must beware when it comes to entering into the world of Battle Royale. You might get more than you bargained for.",Battle Royale
124,kooleshwar,Battle Royale....................in the Mind.,7,29 January 2007,"I didn't really want to watch this movie, I was desperate to watch some Japanese stylised action, but in India, I might as well hope for world peace.So I checked out the foreign section of the DVD library (the most expensive one but definitely not the best, the best ones are where the film industry of India lives which explains all the ""Inspired"" films I've actually seen the master pirater Sanjay Gupta walk out of one) and after going through the huge selection of films 40 movies no less, I just about found 4-5 Japenese films, this one sounded the most interesting and also the most disturbing, even though this was not what I wanted, I ended up hiring it anyway.What seemed hard to digest on the back of the DVD got even more hard to digest when the movie started, the actors looked anything but 14 the age they were supposed to be, normally I like it when the movie offers just passing info about the events that preceded the film (STARWAR got me hooked to this), but I couldn't think of anything that would lead up-to this film.Im not the kind that likes to apply Freudian logic to everything about the film, but the events that shape the film are just impossible to comprehend.Anyway the movie starts and the first thing you realise is that this film is not a typical action movie, no stylised display of action here, this movie is extremely brutal, on purpose I suspect.Again this movie will fluctuate through extremes of how much the human body can take sometimes people will die if the easiest manner possible, while others will take forever to die.This movie has taken the extra effort to be arty and the effort shows, the music is classical, the action is brutal and bloody, the actors are underage, the themes are all based on the requirement that most normal moviegoers will not come within 20 feet of this movie, ON THEIR OWN WILL.And therein lies the brilliance, make a movie with SOLID PRODUCTION VALUES, GOOD BACKGROUND MUSIC, GOOD ACTING, GREAT CINEMATOGRAPHY AND MAKE SURE THAT 90% OF THE THE PEOPLE ARE REPULSED BY IT AND THE CRITICS WILL LAP IT UP.They will give it ratings that will go through the roof, and soon the people who didn't want to watch the movie in the first place will also end up watching it and then give it similar ratings.Im in the middle, I wanted to watch an arty Japanese film, and even though I didn't want this I still found this movie entertaining and thats my NO1 CRITERIA WHILE RATING A FILM. I like virtual violence and this movie will satisfy that urge like no other.This movie does however also suffer from some really corny dialogues and extremely clichéd scenes even by Hindi movie standards.The movie is luckily not that long and before the movie can get on your nerves its over.The kill or be killed scenario is this movie gives us some really interesting scenes and characters, such as the poisoning scene, the rebels, the guy who enjoys it, those who go with the flow.The movie also has an interesting way to show why the people behaved the way they did, the arty disjointed flashbacks have been done before but are still a treat to watch.The movie has a morbid atmosphere and that has been created brilliantly, the music the islands, the light, you can literally feel the wet cold, the fear and frustration.There are a couple of humorous dialogues which were much needed and much appreciated.So many factors are at play here that there's a royal battle in the mind, which finally boils to the main point, deciding if you love it or hate it, you wont find many in the bracket between 3 and 7 like me.In all we have a decent foreign language film that will basically satisfy only a narrow audience but be rated highly by all, possible types are LOVERS OF VIOLENCE, LOVERS OF ART HOUSE FILMS, THOSE WHO APPLY FREUDIAN LOGIC TO FILM ETC.Rent only if your in the mood for such entertainment though as this is Definitely NOT EASY VIEWING, keep in mind what your getting into and the fact that this is not as good as the critics want you believe.-s very hard to digest, not easy viewing, over-hyped,extra effort to do things differently shows, even then there are loads of clichéd scenes.+/-s no explanations for lots of events including those that lead to the film.+s excellent production values including soundtrack, cinematography etc, good acting,hard hitting violence, some brilliant scenes, good humour too.total 7-7.5/10 (factoring in expectations on absolute terms this movie is not as good for a lover of R rated commercial cinema like me)",Battle Royale
125,Atavisten,Shocking or not?,5,23 May 2005,"This created a big fuzz some years ago and thats because the mainstream is very easily offended. Its premises are very unrealistic, but as a movie taking its creative liberties its not much different from any other action movie where people get killed a dime a dozen for no logical reason (most action movies), its not so much more shocking either.It does provide a reason and some social commentary, this is best to not think too much of and instead enjoy the movie. The best commentary it induces is the fuzz created around it.I see the director is considered a grand old man in Japanese cinema, if I were to judge by 'Battle Royale' I would laugh at that. The interaction between the characters are not so well, the suspense are lacking and the flashbacks and some of the things people do on that island (like go jogging) is laughable. Its entertaining still. The story is not so bad and could do very well if it was reworked a bit.Oh.. the music is so obvious that its almost surprising. 'Air on G-string' for example is fine music, but a cheap way to make a film-score.",Battle Royale
126,topitimo-829-270459,Passable action film. Very good satire. Fascinating documentary.,7,16 February 2020,"Fukasaku Kinji's ""Battle Royale"" (2000) is one of the most widely seen live-action features of modern Japanese cinema. It is a film that has legions of fans, but like, say, ""Fight Club"" (1999), many of those fans aren't looking for deeper meanings within the narrative, or maybe aren't even aware that there are such to be found. And indeed, for some young people - and even fellow reviewers - this film might be interesting merely because of all the shocking violence, and girls in sexy school uniforms.Long before ""The Hunger Games"", ""Battle Royale"" painted a narrative about a dystopian future where teenagers are forced to fight to the death. 42 class-mates are taken to a remote island, where they have three days time to kill each other. Everything is allowed, and only the winner gets out alive. We see the teenagers' efforts of surviving this gory reality, as the clock starts ticking.Now, a narrative like this will absolutely worry some parents, even prompting some to fear for copycat -behavior in real life. After all, it's a film were the deaths of innocent schoolchildren are shown to be entertaining. But this is not a film that should be shown to audiences, who read it literally. ""Battle Royale"" as an action film is passable at best, but its true merits are to be seen by viewing it as a satire, or even a documentary (if not a literal one).The film is clearly a product of its time and shows much of the mentalities, that haunted Japan of year 2000. After the bursting of the economic bubble, the hopes of Japanese people for the country's future started to turn more pessimistic. No longer a future superpower, Japanese culture started to feel stale and downward. The culture - including cinema - was no longer booming, birth rates dropped, and the general atmosphere was plagued by different worries about the state of the modernized society. Children were viewed as lazy as well as lacking ambition and respect for their elderly. In a society like this, it is easy to see a dystopian work like ""Battle Royale"" becoming popular.The film documents the national state of mind in a fascinating way, but even if you aren't into all that sociology behind the scenes, you might enjoy the satirical edge of the film. It makes fun of Japanese popular culture, and reality television. Its shock value comes with an absolute desire to agitate, and as it proceeds, it becomes more and more amused by its own existence. It is not a film that takes itself seriously, and neither should you. My favorite part of the film was Kitano Takeshi's hammy performance as the former teacher turned project leader. He is having so much fun in this film, and absolutely chews the scenery.Though it might at first appear a young and energetic work, the director Fukasaku had actually directed films for 40 years. He died shortly after directing the sequel to this film. I have seen many Fukasaku films, and while all aren't as interesting, or don't have the time capsule-ish value of this film, it is not among the director's best works. It is interesting partly, because it has become so popular, but it is really not representative of his whole filmography, which also includes serious and more prestigious works, as well as pure exposition. ""Battle Royale"" also goes on for much too long, and the satirical edge of the film would be more easy to spot, were this film considerably tighter. It would have been so easy to edit this, too, simply by having fewer students in the original premise. Say, 30 instead of 40?This will definitely provoke different reactions. Myself I did not love it, but laughed every once in awhile, especially due to Kitano's presence.",Battle Royale
127,faraaj-1,Japanese 7th graders survival of the fittest,8,17 November 2006,"Batoru rowaiaru is one of cult director Fukasaku's last, and in a long-lasting career most famous film. It obviously pays homage to Stanley Kubrick - especially A Clockwork Orange. The film is set in a post-millennium Japan on the brink of collapse. Unemployment stands at 15% and kids are running riot. The govt. passes the B.R. Act and a group of 42 7th grade students and put on a deserted island for three days. Their mission is surviving and being the last left alive. If at the end of three days, more than one is left alive, all die. Each student is given some survival essentials and a weapon according to their pot-luck. A weapon can be dangerous an axe, a machine fun, a rifle or something as innocuous as a big lid for a pot.Very quickly, the 42 students, or whats left of them when mayhem and a few deaths ensue in the briefing, quickly disperse. Typical behavior patterns form quickly: boy and girl in love, mad killer, computer geeks trying to find a technical glitch, girl groups and the group trying to find a way to escape the island. The great thing about the movie is that despite a very large cast, you quickly get an idea of each character or group and towards the last half hour, know which people must still be alive. It requires considerable mastery to involve the audience like this.Battle Royale is a great actioner and may pass itself off as an intellectual Darwinian battle or Kubrick like. It isn't. There is no greater message or theme and its just a well paced and VERY violent actioner thriller. Of course, given the territory you will see all manner of decapitation, but and while I personally found it palatable, not all people would. The acting was manic and too over the top at times. However, this film will appeal to quite a few people and I personally enjoyed watching it once.",Battle Royale

Is this not done in every horror flick since the beginning of time?All of a sudden b/c you put them as an entire class people are in an uproar. This movie pushes things to the limit and then takes you beyond.  It is fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat in a movie where you don't even trust anyone.If you can get a hold of a copy of this movie buy it.  It is definitely worth the watch.PS  Next time you are going to get angry at watching a high school student get killed by their friend stay away from movies like Scream (put someone in a costume and it's okay to knife your buddies).,Battle Royale
129,MickeyTheConstant,A must see movie,9,7 August 2019,"I have always rated this movie and have watched it numerous times. I had not see it for a good few years though and so gave it another watch. The plot itself is quite simple but at the same time was really original at the time and quite shocking. It's just a movie I really associated with when I first watched it and still do. A movie about love, friendship and loyalty in extreme circumstances. It's quite relevant today with certain youth groups falling into trouble and anti social behaviour/crime for numerous reasons, mainly circumstance and dissatisfaction and how governments try and solve these issues, in this case in a very extreme and brutal way. Yes, I do think Hunger Games ripped it off, although must stress I did enjoy the HG series also and these days many films borrow elements off others. A must watch. Truly original and innovative storytelling. Read the book it's based on also.",Battle Royale
130,fredschaefer-406-623204,A true pulp fiction classic.,8,4 April 2014,"BATTLE ROYALE is a knockout of a movie, a true pulp fiction classic. Based upon the novel by Koushoun Takami, it has a real cult following based upon its simple and compelling plot-42 Japanese 9th graders are kidnapped and released on a deserted island by their government, given weapons and commanded to kill each other within three days until there is only one survivor; if more than one is still alive at the end of the three days, than all will be killed. Another reason why the movie has so many fans is the quite graphic violence as there are many scenes of shootings and stabbings, not to mention an ax to the head.The fact that all this mayhem and gore is being meted out by kids is what gives the story its bite; teenagers are immature and emotional under the best of conditions, so BATTLE ROYALE puts them under maximum stress and and extreme danger and lets all hell break loose. The bonds of old school cliques and gangs are quickly frayed as everyone is forced to reveal who they really are under that adolescent bravado. Some of the ""nice"" kids, like the jock Shuya, and the shy Noriko, simply try to survive and not kill their friends, while others like the ruthless Kiriyama, and the sly and selfish Mitsuko, throw themselves into the game with gusto, killing their fellow classmates without a second thought. Two sweethearts decide to die together rather than one live without the other in a poignant scene. There are a few changes from the novel, the main one being the introduction of a new character, the Sensi, who replaces Sakamochi, the government honcho overseeing the battle in the book. The movie also concentrates on Shuya, Noriko, and Shogo at the expense of others who were fully developed in the novel, especially the character of Yutaka, the nerd. But for the most part, the live action version of BATTLE ROYALE,follows the action of the book pretty well.The casting of age appropriate actors was absolutely necessary to make the movie work, when we see these kids die on screen, we are well aware that all their hopes, dreams and potential are dying with them; that is the true horror of the story. Tatsuya Fujiwara, who plays Shuya, later played Light Yagami in a live action version of DEATH NOTE; Noriko's Chiaki Kuriyama was Gogo Yubari in KILL BILL. Takeshi Kitano's face looked familiar and a quick check of IMDb revealed that I'd seen him in MERRY Christmas, MR. LAWRENCE and JOHNNY MNEMONIC. Special praise to director Kinji Fukasaru, who made a great movie that was true to the book. I think one of the big reasons why BATTLE ROYALE has such a following is because of how politically incorrect the whole thing is in the post Columbine era; we are not supposed to find any enjoyment in the sight of teenagers slaughtering each other in a movie in a time when school shootings have become too commonplace. Yet here we are. The fact that there is no apparent higher agenda in BATTLE ROYALE lets anyone find their own meaning in it all.I also think BATTLE ROYALE connects with so many now is because American movies have watered down their violence so much in the past few decades, just compare THE MATRIX and THE DARK KNIGHT RISES to THE WILD BUNCH and THE GODFATHER. There was talk a few years back about a Hollywood remake of BATTLE ROYALE, but I hope it never happens now. They would tone down the gore and cast a bunch of twenty-somethings in all the parts, utterly ruining it.",Battle Royale
131,headly66,Who's giving this mess 10 stars?,3,5 December 2013,"It seems a lot of people are comparing the Hunger Games to this Japanese B movie about a group of teens who are forced to fight each other to the death. I agree THG is a rip off of this film but that doesn't change my rating for it.The plot comes on so quick with no real background, one day they are in class the next being forced to fight and they never really give a reason why.The acting is over done and hammy, the plot is dull and the violence is so over the top to the point where it became tedious.

132,Semisonic,A song of the youth,7,29 June 2015,"It was the winter of 2001/2002 when i saw Battle Royale for the first time in a local art-house cinema theater. I was two months before turning 18 back then. Now, almost 15 years later, i got a chance to re-watch it, and i took it.You know, back in time BR seemed like a true revelation, a piece of something i have never seen before, a life-turning event. Seriously, for days after that visit to the movie theater i was in a semi-trance state, still brooding about what i had seen. This film felt like a quintessence of my own vision of the world, of my hopes and dreams, my fears and regrets, naked and devoid of any shame and shyness all the young people inevitably have towards themselves, their new-found wishes and their perception of the world around.When BR got a home media release, I tried to show it to my parents, hoping they would feel the same revelation as i did. To my surprise, they never went beyond that typical stern look when you realize you screwed up again, and the faked appreciation like ""hmmm, that was a really unusual film"". I was obviously not ready to such reaction, but back then i didn't give it much thought. After all, to each their own......until i watched this film again now, in 2015. Now, instead of that huge epiphany of sorts, the main emotion i could feel was a moderate degree of irritation and frustration. About the premise that actually defies any reasonable logic. About the characters' behavior that would fit a sick slasher anime flick where everyone is over-the-top and mentally unstable, rather than a feature film with real actors. The weird flashbacks/cutscenes that made you wonder if the writer or the director were on drugs when making this film. And the finale, with the message so unlikely that you can't help thinking ""if this is it, then what's the point altogether?!"".In other words, the movie makes no sense. There's no other way of saying it. And although i can only speculate whether it was the reason behind my parents' not liking it, at least i have one viable assumption about it now. Yet, if you take a second look, there is something about Battle Royale, something that not only redeems it as a worthy piece of cinema but also lets it stay its ground as a potential source of enlightenment.Like i said, the movie made no sense. But the youth itself hardly makes more sense either. It definitely makes no sense for the young, since they have no idea what they are doing, why they are doing it and what lies ahead. We all used to think we're the chosen ones, those who finally view the world as it is, without all that decrepit residue that our parents' heads are stuffed with which makes them so blind and insensitive. But we were nothing but the blind pups ourselves, with just our arrogance, stupidity and naivety to lead the way.I used to like BR. Now, upon a re-watch, i can't say that much. It's a film one could describe with words like ""unsettling"", ""distasteful"" and even ""preposterous"". But the same epithets i could address towards the today's young people. Those goddamn ingrates, they have no respect for the experience, no second thought about anything, and, above all, no slightest doubt about their ways. In other words, they are just what we used to be in their age. And that's the most infuriating.This is a rather unique experience. To observe your perception of something slide from one end of the gauge to the other. The most important thing here is to realize that the film itself has nothing to do with it. It's just a piece of celluloid (and its analog and digital derivatives) that stayed the same for all these years. It's you who has changed. Just like those high frequency sounds you allegedly stop being able to hear when you reach a certain age, so the kids in a classroom can use them to communicate to each other without the teacher overhearing it, this film simply stops being able to hit through your skull and reach for that tender responsive spot you used to be able to sense it with. Did it simply get blunt from all these years? Or maybe it's your skull that got too thick, and that sensitive spot that used to be inside just withered away?I'm sure that each of us will give a different answer to this question, one that fits their own sense of self-comfort the most. But it doesn't change anything, Because no matter what we see maturity for, a bliss or a misery, it is still something that just happens - and changes your perception of things forever. If that means that Battle Royale doesn't hit me anymore - then so be it. After all, it's a hymn for the young, and it's their battle now. As for us, there's still plenty of fights going to keep ourselves engaged till the very end. To each their own indeed.",Battle Royale
133,pontram,A Frustrated Teacher's Daydream,4,20 June 2011,"Everyone who thinks this is a good movie has to switch off the inner teen and begin to use his or her brain for a short moment, if that's possible.There would not be any problem with the premise, if the premise alone would not exclude itself from its own premise to be such one. In other words: If one would would agree to such a law, he would support the survival of the fittest, and that's exactly the only person who shouldn't survive the battle, it would be the most ruthless and most brutal of all candidates, one of the most unwanted children of all in the first place.So, a real sociopath would have the best chances to win. Every other children dying during such a game would be simply wasted potential. Besides, putting together the worst with the best, in all senses, would not make any sense at all.If such a law should generate any impact with its execution on the revolting and seemingly useless youth, you have to broadcast every death and every fight like a reality show, otherwise no one would notice what's going on. In the movie the drama happens somewhere on Japanese backyard, and the public notices only the remaining winner.If you can overcome these holes like the often idiotic premises of Vampire or Zombie movies, you have to struggle with overacting, which is understandable with a mostly teen cast, with a Takeshi who seems to be completely misplaced, and with nearly 40 killings which are mostly executed ridiculous. Maybe You have to struggle with some sympathy feelings for some actors, which you will lose soon because you realize that it is senseless.Some people claim that this is the Japanese Clockwork Orange. Well, that fulfills neither Japanese Movie-Art nor Kubrick's work. You can only say that both movies are dystopic, but that's all. The only scene worth to mention is the nice introduction and information video, a really humorous performance that could give you a chill through its happy sexy mercilessness.'Batoru rowaiaru' is a speculative mistake by all means, poor crafted and only produced to gain maximum profit. There is nothing revealed in the movie, nothing new, except showing a big number of teens killing each other in order to survive. Yes, if you give them weapons, most of them will do.

In this tale, a randomly selected high school class is transported to an uninhabited island, given electronic tracking collars and weapons, and told that they have 3 days to kill each other off, with only the last survivor being given the opportunity to return home.

136,Torgo_Approves,Every 15-year old should see this movie at least once!,10,21 October 2006,"(r#86)(When you're reading this review, keep in mind that I'm a rabid fan of this film and I might get carried away from time to time. Anyway, I hope I can make this review as coherent and fair as possible, despite my strong feelings towards the masterpiece that is Battle Royale.)Battle Royale is one of those rare movies that blow you away, stick with you. It's a masterful combination of superb visuals and music, ranging from Japanese pop to classical Western pieces. The performances are solid all around, which is impressive considering the huge cast (there are 42 teenage actors and actresses here who all need to provide a good performance for the movie to work!). The acting is highlighted by two positively brilliant and remarkable performances, from newcomer Kou Shibasaki, who plays Mitsuko, by far the most interesting student in the school class, and Japanese cult actor ""Beat"" Takeshi Kitano as a bitter teacher who got fed up with students stabbing him in the rear. Masanobu Ando is also quite impressive, in a silently menacing way, as the bloody psychotic exchange student Kiriyama. This guy owns each and every one of his scenes with his sweet tuxedo and his unnerving fascination with violence.At first viewing, Battle Royale is an absolutely mind-blowing thrill ride, and it has enough depth and complexity to improve, rather than coagulate, on repeated viewings, unlike other action movies. Although I don't think I could really describe why I love Battle Royale so much in simple words, I guess I'll have to try: Battle Royale is a masterpiece because it so successfully combines dark humour, superb action, tension, style, substance, characters, top class performances, and even a slice of romance to boot. The plot and the execution of it is absolutely original and nothing quite like it has ever been made before. As a 15-year old, I can relate to the characters and even recognize many of them, they're high school archetypes without being clichés, and definitely not the cardboard cut-outs you'd find in an American teen movie: the dumb jock, the Asian nerd, the hot cheerleader, etc.The film moves at a breakneck speed but never feels rushed. The pacing is just wonderful, with the right moments of peaceful silence followed by another exhilarating thunderstorm of music or a cascade of bullets.This is, of course, a very brutal movie, and the violence was at times hard to watch. That's not to say I'm queasy, I gladly watch bloodshed and torture without flinching, but when the violence is aimed towards teens or children, well, it's just not as easy to laugh at. A brilliant thing about this film is how easily it can make you change between emotions. Take the scene in which the kids' teacher, Kitano, explains how a game of Battle Royale is played. One minute you're gasping at the violence, the next you're laughing your buttocks off at the completely off-the-wall training video. You'll know what I mean when you see it.Unfortunately, no one can be told what Battle Royale is. You have to see it for yourself. I hope this review doesn't make me sound like some raving fanboy. If you don't watch this movie you are a no good adult. Just run down to the video store and rent it right now. RUN!",Battle Royale

The fact that tyranny plays a role here is not a factor that determines a priori that this is an artistic masterpiece of democratic criticism. As with the more recent program ""Squid Games"", this type of setting is used instead, for a staging of violence that seems to be made exclusively for people who indulge in that affinity for violence, without being one of so many to recognize speculated criticism of the system in this film.

Enter Fukasaku's latest endeavor BATTLE ROYALE, a bloody and violent story about a future Japan that sacrifices its youth in the name of stability and peace.  The outrageous premise of the story involves a government sponsored lottery that randomly selects a class of Junior High School/High School students to enter a contest called BATTLE ROYALE.  BATTLE ROYALE is basically a gladiatorial style event where students must kill each other to win their freedom.  The catch however is that only one student can be allowed to live and if any others survive, then all the contestants will be eliminated via explosive collars around their necks.  This makes for continual conflict as friends, rivals and lovers kill each other in order to survive.  BATTLE ROYALE has received much criticism and interest due to its no-holds-barred portrayal of teens killing indiscriminately and its vicious tone.  In retrospect, the hype is somewhat overblown as the violence depicted is no more-or-less explicit or different from films such as Sam Peckinpah's WILD BUNCH, Quentin Terrantino's RESORVOIR DOGS or John Woo's HARD BOILED.  What is more shocking however is the heavy-handed and sometime ludicrous dialogue that surrounds the film. While I wasn't expecting Shakespeare, the dialogue was so melodramatic, and so overly hammy that I can only wonder if this was intentional on the part of Fukasaku.  Perhaps, Fukusaku wanted the film to play as a satire on violence and teen melodrama or maybe it was just the English subtitles themselves that made this impression, albeit the Japanese dialogue itself seemed to belong to standard TV drama fair.   What also was disappointing was the fact that we never really were made to sympathize with the BATTLE ROYALE students.  Granted, it's hard to really focus on any one or two students in great detail when you have 41 kids running around killing each other left and right.   Thus when students die, there is no real empathy or remorse.  It is as if the students are merely there to be killed and act as cannon fodder for the camera.  Of course we see their names prominently displayed as they are killed but to the audience these are just names on the screen with no really meaning or identity behind them.  `Beat'  Takeshi Kitano is the standout by far as the teacher turned war room organizer of the mayhem.  Similar to his other roles in HANA-BI and VIOLENT COP, he can be funny one moment and mercilessly cruel the next.  The other standout is pretty boy Masanobu Ando who is the near silent but lethal Kiriyama who makes Crispin Glover's Thin Man in CHARLIE'S ANGELS look  like a patsy in comparison.  Tatsuya Fujiwara and Aki Maeda are okay as the cute high school sweethearts trying to find a way out of the games and Taro Yamamoto is engaging as the Transfer student from Kobe who can't seem to make up his mind on the occupation of his father.  BATTLE ROYALE will probably never see mass market American Distribution due to its subject matter in light of all the recent high school shooting incidents.  Perhaps this is not that bad of thing.  I think we see enough real life `battle royales' in the news anyway.",Battle Royale
139,extravaluejotter,"Not Your Usual ""Teens In Peril"" film.",7,17 September 2006,"I have to stand up and say that usually I hate this sort of film. The basic premise of rounding up a bunch of Pretty Young Things and subjecting them to pointless violence has been a staple of cinema horror for many years. To give you some idea of how much I hate this sub-genre, check out my review of the Australian outback slash-flick ""Wolf Creek"".What got me to watch was the idea that someone had taken Reality/Survivor TV to its illogical conclusion and forced the contestants to kill each other in order to win. To be honest, this premise is hardly used in ""Battle Royale"" as the only monitoring of the contestants seems to be through microphones built into their collars.However, once I'd started watching, I couldn't stop. Despite all the violence and cruelty on display, ""Battle Royale"" is full of tender, human moments. There is also a sprinkling of black humour as well. Takeshi Kitano is at his impassive best as the high school teacher-turned-murderous game show host, easily upstaging the younger members of the cast. Some of their performances are a little overwrought by western standards but this is a minor criticism.The idea of a yearly government-sanctioned cull of youngsters to try and keep a country's rebellious youth in line is pretty preposterous. For me, the film would have worked better if the event had been televised and we could have seen the reactions of viewers (maybe even the contestants' parents) at home. You could shoot holes in the plot and the cheap production values all day long, but for me it's worth watching for the sometimes poignant personal stories of the contestants and their former teacher. Director Kinji Fukasaku creates some well-realised vignettes of teen angst and adult disillusion in ""Battle Royale"". These lift the film high above anything else in the ""Stalk and Slash"" genre.Recommended.",Battle Royale
140,ThreeGuysOneMovie,what the Hunger Games should have been,8,27 July 2012,"It has been suggested that the recent Hunger Games is a rip-off of this film. While the Hunger Games featured a bit more back story, and character development than Battle Royale, in many ways this is a superior film. Where the Hunger Games glossed over the reality of what was going on, this film fully embraces the murder and mayhem that would take place in such a situation. If the premise of your film is children killing each other, it's to the films detriment not to show that taking place. In a way skipping over the killing, actually serves to glamorize the horror, of what is being shown on the screen.To see our full review head on over to 3guys1movie.com",Battle Royale

It's action packed, with a great story, great acting, great follow throughs. Towards the ending it becomes a little too melodramatic but the film has a lot too say and a film like this would do well to be soon more in this country. It's about a new gov't program that makes jr. h.s kill eachother on an island for survival.

142,jaxbubba,"If you are a fan on the Hunger Games Trilogy, you will enjoy Battle Royale",7,9 April 2012,"Almost nine years prior to Suzanne Collins publishing Volume One of ""The Hunger Games"" in 2008, Koushun Takami published ""Batoru Rowaiaru"" (Battle Royale) a Japanese novel completed in 1996 and published in 1999. The Japanese film followed in 2000, and can be downloaded with English sub-titles from thepiratebay.org.Both novels center on youths in a fight-to-the-death at the demand of the local government in charge in order to repress the spirit/fight of the populace.In Battle Royale, the government chooses a specific class of students at random to compete against one another. In the 2001 iteration of ""The Games"" it was a Ninth Grade of 42 students. While on their way en route to school, the bus in which the class is on gets gassed and is abducted. When the class regains their consciousness, they are greeted by a former teacher (Mr Kitano), who explains that their class has been selected to fight to their death. The class has been brought to an isolated island, and has exactly three (3) days to complete the task at hand. If a winner is not produced after three (3) days, then all remaining survivors will be executed (the whole class has been equipped with radio-activated death collars around their necks). In addition, the playing field will be whittled away as the game proceeds; if players remain in an area deemed ""no longer in play"" their collar will be activated, and the player killed. Each player upon entering the game is given a random bag of supplies which includes food, water, a map, compass, and some random weapon. Also thrown in the mix are three (3) additional ""professional"" killer-students to assist in reducing the playing field, much like the professional tributes in the Hungers Game.While the tributes in the Hunger Games are fighting for the betterment of their districts, the youths in Battle Royale are only fighting for personal survival. However, there are definitely similarities of the two novels / films. I actually recommend seeing Battle Royale; I enjoyed it immensely. I believe if you are a fan on the Hunger Games Trilogy, you will enjoy Battle Royale as well! Happy Hunting!!! SEE MORE OF MY REVIEWS AT THE FARIS REEL ON FACEBOOK!!!!",Battle Royale
143,Sankari_Suomi,Fun and filth on a deserted island,7,22 July 2018,"If you're old enough to remember this movie, you'll recall the wild thrill we all felt when it exploded onto cinema screens in a riotous burst of muted tones, squirting blood, and cute Japanese schoolgirls in short-skirted uniforms.The year is 2xxx. The Japanese government is fed up with young people and their bullshit. A new policy is implemented to address the problems exacerbated by these irresponsible little scrotes, and it receives universal public support. The rules are simple: 42 kids enter, only one kid leaves. Some social commentators have argued that the same policy could be used to address the plague of parasitic, self-entitled millennials that currently blights Western society. I, for one, would strongly favour such a proposal.This entire film is carried on the broad shoulders of Takeshi Kitano, a hardboiled movie veteran who needs no introduction here. If you enjoy him in Battle Royale, you'll love him even more in the Autoreiji trilogy (go and watch it right now!)I rate Battle Royale: Extended Version at 23.31 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a blood-soaked 7/10 (with just a hint of sexy schoolgirl thighs) on IMDB.",Battle Royale
144,Kubris,Harrowing and violent,8,21 October 2011,"Battle Royale tells the disturbing story of a class of grade 9's who have to kill each other on an island. Similar to the classic Lord of the Flies, and clearly inspiring The Hunger Games, the concept is upsetting and interesting.The film opens up with a really unnerving news broadcast that sets the tone: ""She's smiling! She's smiling!"" That's a face that is burned in my mind now. Like the content, the tone of BR is dark completely, and that benefits the film. Also beneficial is the juxtaposition with classical music playing, which is really cool.The plot is simple past the premise, but the action is great. It's realistic, and some of the deaths are quite disturbing, intentionally. BR has great scenes, like the opening, the lighthouse and the shack. It really captures the fear of the concept.So BR has an original concept, nails the tone and style and has brutal violence. Unfortunately the acting isn't quite up-to-snuff. There is some cheesy dialogue and hammy death speeches, and quite a few ""I've always loved you."" These silly bits take away from the consistency. Only Kiwada stands out among the actors, and the two psychopathic students are quite scary.Then everything wraps up well, but I would've preferred a darker ending. The good in Battle Royale far outweighs the negative, and you should see this great Japanese film if you can handle it. An original treat. 8.3/10",Battle Royale
145,neenahhh,A very daring movie that falls short when compared to the book,5,17 June 2011,"While watching this movie, I couldn't help but compare it to the book. Hey! It's natural instinct! And having said that, I must also add that the movie is a very poor remake of the book.""Battle Royale"" is about a class of teenagers who have to kill their classmates in order to survive. That is as deep as the movie goes. It's practically a gore-fest with a few love confessions drawn here and there. It's sad to say that this movie doesn't have the same emotional impact that the book carried.Then again, I must give this movie props. I couldn't really expect the full 600-paged book to fit into one movie. And I'm sure that there are people who have never read the book, but still loved the movie. If I forgot the book for a minute, I would have had to agree. The movie is very straightforward.I think that the movie appeals to a lot of people because of the daring idea and concept. While watching this, I had to look away a lot of times. It is very gory, yes. But it isn't anything too bad to make you throw up.I was disappointed with the ending. If the book was followed down to the last detail, it could have been better. The ending wasn't the only disappointment for me. There were many characters who were too underdeveloped so I found that I didn't really feel anything for their movie selves. Examples are Shinji and Mitsuko. There was really a disappointing lack of emotional pull that the movie had. If you liked the movie, you should try reading the book, then. It is a lot better.Viewed on: June 18, 2011",Battle Royale
146,NateManD,"Brilliant, Violent, Horrifying, Gutwrenching, Humorous and Sad!",10,10 August 2005,"Many people watch ""Battle Royale"" to see teen actors kill each other and for it's splatter violence. I enjoyed ""Battle Royale"" for its powerful story and satirical wit. Director Kinji Fukasaku's goal was to show how war effects children, also to show the generation gap in Japan between adults and teens. In the future, Japan has a problem with the rate of teen crime, so the government passes the battle royale act. In a ""Survivor"" like fashion 42 teens are chosen at random and put on an island. They have to kill one another until one person is left. This includes shooting, stabbing, decapitating or whatever means necessary. To make matters worse, they all are forced to wear tracking device collars that will explode if they refuse to cooperate. Our main character Shuya comes home and finds that his father has killed himself. Takeshi Kitano plays Mr. Kitano the teacher. After getting stabbed by a juvenile student, Kitano submits the names of his whole class for Battle Royale. All the students think that they are going on a field trip, little do they know that it's their turn for ""Battle Royale""! What makes the film horrifying, is to put yourself in the situation. Imagine being forced to kill people who are your friends and that you have known all your life. The two protagonists Shuya and Noriko form a bond and fight to survive. (together if possible) Also there's the killing crazed femme fatal, Mitsuko. She seems to be a loner who kills for fun. Also, director Quinten Tarantino loved ""Battle Royale"" so much that he even casted one of the actresses Chiaki Kuriyama in ""Kill Bill: Volume 1"". Tarentino also appeared in the Battle Royale: Special Edition movie trailer. I highly recommend the Special Edition director's cut since it has flashbacks and extra character development. It makes the film sad and emotional, because you really get to know the students. Even Metsuko has her reason for acting the way she does. So if you like violent action films that also have a hidden message, you should definitely see ""Battle Royale"". Be warned, it may be too disturbing for some viewers.",Battle Royale
147,au_law2001,"No matter how disturbing, watch it for it is worth it.",10,10 March 2005,"I just watched it recently, after reading and hearing about it, and how the schoolgirl of Kill Bill Go Go Yubari was in it, I decided to take a chance at it to see if it is as gruesome as they say it is. And I watched and guess what, I loved it! Though some murders weren't that disturbing the others and the way they got killed really shocked me. Like the way Mitsuko killed Megumi, or how Kuninobu gets his collar blown up. That bothered me a lot. From what I see, I guess it's no the violence that is disturbing, it's the theme of it. Students killing other students, reluctantly, not intentionally. I've seen a lot of slasher films where teens get killed gruesomely by maniacs, but never students, but wait, I think there are a few, but not in the manner just like this one. In Carrie, it's the psychokinetic powers that kill the students, but that's it. I must say, this is probably the reason why Toei decided not to license it to the U.S. One is that they wanted it to have the same respect Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon had, but it can't because of the content, they might not meet the standards of the MPAA. It did cause a controversy in Japan though, I think, I heard that a few politicians wanted to ban this, but some how, the movie still went and got passed them. It probably was hard work that they got through them, but to get through the MPAA and American parents, preachers and politicians, would be like suicide, because perhaps parents all over the US would protest against it, and they would be the center of controversy, or would get sued by parents, if another school shooting occurs. And also they might criticize it saying it has Columbine undertones, for it had two kids who were dangerous, in the persons of Kawada and Kiriyama. And they used sub machine guns and shotguns right? That's what the kids in Columbine used right? And the scene of poor Kusaka and Yukiko getting shot sadistically by Kiriyama, if seen by American parents, they will begin to remember the horrible murders that the Columbine kids did. And the part with Mimura saying near the end that he will bomb the school, also sounds like an act of terrorism, that would cause another controversy. But overall, I enjoyed this all, though it had a few references, like the scene after Nakagawa got poisoned by Sakaki unintentionally, she wanted to do it to Nanahara, because she thinks he killed Oki, they all went crazy and shot each other, it's just like the old Dead Trilogy movies, where everyone's fear and suspicions get them killed. And the ones with Kitano, the last one reminded me of Falling Down, when he asked Noriko to kill him or he will kill them, just like what Douglas tells Duvall, but when Shuya does shoot him, it is revealed he had a water pistol, and not a gun, just like what Douglas had at the end. And not to mention the one with Chigusa, played by the girl form Kill Bill Chiaki Kuriyama, her death scene was sad. And the ones with Mitsuko and Kiriyama. And the last battle with Kawada and Kiriyama, it was cool, and guess what, anime seiyuu Yuko Miymura is in it too as the video training girl, and the soundtrack is also great. Watch it, it is great, and one of the final films Kinji Fukasaku made, thank you, may God rest your soul. Shizukana Hibi No Kaidan Wo.",Battle Royale

149,frankgaipa,Avenging Angels,7,7 March 2005,"Sorry, but here comes what I often hate--one of those ""I read the book and the film didn't get it right"" reviews. For my original impressions of Battle Royale, based on a years-past theatrical screening and a more recent reading of the Koushun Takami's novel, click on my name to get my BR2 comment. Writing with no reference except memory about films years gone is a peculiar exercise, sometimes nearly bogus, other times rewarding either about the film or oneself. Moving images and memory surely have things in common.To check my memories of BR1 against the novel, I've just rewatched it, this time on DVD. One thing struck me immediately as unfortunate. One massive shift renders an aspect of the film weaker than the novel. Kazuo, the most dangerous student in the film, slams onto screen taller than perhaps anyone else. While the others wear school uniforms, he dresses, slouches, and struts like a rock star. Every move says punk, rebel, wild, and so maybe even wasted romantic since rebellion entails a vision of an alternate status quo. In the camera's eye, he's a known entity, a cliché movie tough who has to fall eventually because they always do.Takami's prose Kazuo ""wasn't too big"" (page 91 of the paperback translation). He's extremely smart, good-looking, and has, if not quite friends, hangers-on. I'm sure he never slouches or struts. Such things would be irrelevant to him. The key to his character, though known to none save the narrator, the reader, and conceivably himself, is a brain abnormality that deprives him of a conscience. All his decisions, even those that look friendly, are gain/loss calculations. Early in the game, he calculates (different from ""decides"") that, though both options may be doable, winning the game offers a greater possibility of success, a greater reward for effort, than defeating its administrators. This makes him a diminutive monster. Though he's not a killer in the sense of having killed, though he's not a veteran of the game, killing's simply a calculation, so he's a dedicated assassin among frightened amateurs. That, unlike in the film, he looks so much like everyone else, makes him doubly dangerous. The single scariest thing about the vigilantes and other killers in the otherwise awful ""All Night Long"" series is how ordinary they are. Not just how or whether anyone will defeat Kazuo, but whether anyone will even realize before it's too late the danger within him, is so unclear that the terror level rises way higher flipping Takami's pages than watching Fukasaku's film.Other than that, except for the fortunate interpolation of Takashi Kitano's teacher, the film's remarkably faithful to the novel. Virtually every filmable image or plot turn pops up. Every detail of Kitano's performance, even to the stroll on the beach, the umbrella, and the painting, feels so ""Kitano"" (the character's even renamed Kitano) that I wonder whether he isn't directing or even ""writing"" his character himself.Despite all that, on a first viewing for anyone unaware of the book the film explodes on the screen.One last thing: For a great counterpoint to the Kazuo-who-should-have-been-filmed, consider Haruki Murakami's brain-damaged avenging-angel-like Nakata in his recently translated ""Kafka on the Shore."" Nakata is so opposite in so many ways to Kazuo, yet so absolutely like him.",Battle Royale

When a friend let me borrow this movie I had no clue what I was in for. I normally will never watch foreign films much less ones that are not dubbed but this one swayed me a little as I had heard about the book and thought the premise was unique especially since I live in a post Columbine, post 9-11 America. I don't know how this film ever got over here and obtained the popularity it has garnered but it is awesome and deserves it. I love seeing the students fight and love the added on idea that if they do not fight they will die anyway, great entertainment. The island scenery is quite awesome as well. It looks lush and is a great back drop foil for the blood bath that ensues. People need to see this and don't mean the forth coming U.S remake which I am sure will have to tone down the violence as it is directed toward teens and not adults like SAW it's sequel and Hostele. i will still see the remake but am sure it will not live up to it's high octane original.",Battle Royale

In the end, watching ninth graders slaughter each other in various ways without a better reason for the legislation that forced them to do so is not an activity on which I prefer to spend my timealthough it could work for a video game. Also, the strange infusion of various school crushes and flirting was awkwardly scattered throughout the film. Knowing that The Hunger Games is out there, and that William Golding's book Lord of the Flies has been sitting around for decades prior, this movie just seems like a weird exploitation of fetishesor one that I may have enjoyed much more in high school.

For the most part, I was not disappointed. The story, a class of 42 ninth graders forced by law to play the ""most dangerous game"" against each other, was intriguing and the mix of dark humor and graphic violence worked very well. The instructional video scene was a highlight of the movie! Takeshi Kitano was great, as usual, and the rest of the actors did a fine job as well.

155,thomvic,It was better than I was expecting!,9,29 October 2010,"I had only heard about this movie after hearing that Quentin Tarantino loved it, and cast Chiaki Kuriyama in her role as Gogo in Kill Bill Volume 1. So of course, I was expecting some horrific violence that most likely was going to be torturous to watch, especially since Japanese films know how to handle this subject matter with horrific realism.The story is simply this: a bunch of school students who have finished their compulsory education are taken on a bus to a field trip, only to be kidnapped, gassed and have these collars put on them. They awaken to find that they have been selected to participate in a game that is backed by the government. The objective: they have three days to battle against one another: there must be one survivor, and if there isn't a clear winner, all of them will die. Hence, this keeps the motivation to destroy each other one by one.However, I was very surprised when I watched this movie. Sure, it was violent, but not to the extent where it was horrific. What really surprised me most was that I actually cared about these characters. What I was expecting was senseless violence, but the characters are human. You see the struggle they go through to stay together, to not become murderers and also they discover more about themselves along the way. IT also explores what people will become when faced in a life or death situation, and also how some will fight the whole way not to become something that others can so easily become.Yes, I was surprised at how much I cared about the characters. While a lot of them get the 'game over' fairly soon, it is this sense of being trapped and not knowing what to do that creates the whole terror of being stuck in a hopeless situation. The characters are also likable and it is interesting to see how a lot of them learn things quickly and how to adapt, but also on how they form bonds, squabble over little quarrels such as boyfriends and school crushes, and how a lot of them simply want that sense of being loved in what could be their last moments alive.And it really wasn't that violent in my opinion. I think the reason it got an R rating in Australia, is due to the fact that it promotes violence as a game. I didn't particularly find the violence gruesome that I had to turn my eyes away from the screen, but I see that it is definitely a film that shows that violence can be apart of any human being - it only whether we choose to act on it, or are forced to that it becomes a tool we use.I am still astonished that I really got into this movie, considering that I thought this was going to be disturbing and gruesome, and I got something a bit more meaningful instead.",Battle Royale

157,heyimmyx,Immy's review : Fascinating and fun,9,30 July 2020,"Battle Royale is an accomplishment in modern cinema, delivering some truly horrifying terror mixed with complicated teenage feelings, first love, and betrayal. It's accomplishment lies in the fact it portrayed something so gruesome and shocking, and yet so beautiful and emotionally complex at the same time. I thought the film gave an excellent social commentary on the nature of not only teenagers, but human kind in general, as shown by the horrifying moments when friends would turn on friends out of fear. The film takes the emotional turmoil and relationships of young teenagers, and puts them in a setting of the lingering uncertainty of death, making this extremely intriguing and gripping to watch. It wouldn't have been so interesting had it been adults, as the naivety and recklessness of their actions wouldn't have been there. Despite not creating much background to all of the characters, the film is genius in subtly introducing their personality's and relationships through their actions and how they react to the battle, and this alone is enough to make you root for them or completely hate them. I also love how different the teens were, presenting them as real people with their own different hopes, dreams and feelings, thus influencing how they act in battle e.g. the 2 friends who try to make peace and stop the brutal killings, the manic psychopath who kills anyone in his way etc. You get a strong sense of who these people are without even getting a glimpse of their backgrounds, which is what's so astounding. Kitano was absolutely fantastic as the dark and unsettling teacher, who genuinely frightens you with his uncertain and sudden changes in personality. He was a strange but extremely intriguing character, revealing his mentally troubled mind and personal feelings throughout the movie, including his hazy relationship with Noriko. He still remains a mystery, which is why he's so intriguing. The three main characters were of course fabulous and had a beautiful dynamic together, shown by them looking out for each other and the sacrifices they made, conveying a true friendship. It's amazing how such a horrifying setting is placed in contrast with some moving and heart wrenching moments of love and friendship. The classical music often playing in contrast to the scenes of brutal murder was truly nerving and created a tense yet thrilling experience. As much as I loved the hunger games, this movie is much better in terms of horror, mayhem and overall enjoyment. Highly recommend!",Battle Royale

The direction and the writing were all brilliant and the script was done very well. A movie like this was bound to cause controversy but the movie was brilliantly done. The cast and crew should be proud of this! I saw the movie before reading the book and again after and the book is better than the movie, which was to be expected. However, the movie does capture what it is supposed to capture. The acting was brilliant as they captured the emotions of their characters perfectly and you could feel their emotions: Fright, panic, stress, love, hate, delight, etc, and that's what I love in a movie because it makes you feel connected. The violence and blood shed in the movie is very high and yet it didn't really feel unnecessary for the movie. The book was violent so I expected as much from the movie. The book makes you feel more attached to the characters than the movie does but you still feel attached to them in the movie as well. Overall, I would seriously recommend this to anybody who loves a good thriller and don't mind subtitles or violence but if you do mind subtitles and you don't like gory violence, give this a miss. I really recommend you watch this subbed though, dubbed usually isn't very good in a foreign movie.To read more reviews, please visit: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",Battle Royale
161,GuyCC,Survivor: The Nightmare Edition.,9,15 January 2002,"I had just finished seeing ""Battle Royale"" (import version, naturally), and it is by far one of the more intellectually stimulating films I've seen lately.A class is kidnapped and taken to a remote island in order to do battle to the death in an attempt to claim something more valuable than money: their lives.  Truthfully, it's been a long time since I've seen something like this: compelling, disturbing, dark, frightening, powerful....  The island itself is beautiful, which is a sharp contrast to the doomed seventh graders fighting for survival.  While many choose to seek some sort of rationality out of their hopeless scenario, others take delight in unleashing their dark side.  An amazing musical score.  Talented acting.  Sharp visuals.  And yes, while this film is gory, that takes a backseat to the message it gives about man's desire for survival, no matter the age, or how close a friendship seems to be.  I'd have to agree from another reviewer's comment that is does have the survival feel of ""Lord of the Flies"" and the twisted game show mentality of ""Running Man"".  It comes across as some sort of surreal video game, and quite possibly could have been if it were not for the subject matter.It's a shame that we live in a society where students really have killed each other in the past.  Perhaps this film is making a statement about that as well.  But I think its intent goes far beyond that parallel.  It's an amazing film.  Very intelligent, and despite its shocking presentation, it does offer a glimmer of hope in some of these characters that not everyone is easily corruptible.  There's a very fine line between self-defense and outright malicious murder.  Even the heroes of this film are pushed to that limit.  And the ending confrontation of this film does have its moment of truly clever dark humor.I hope American audiences and distributors can come to their senses enough to let this film have at least a DVD release.  If you are able to find a copy of this, by all means see this film.  I've seen very few films that have left me guessing like this or even impressed me on the level that this has.  It's not a slasher flick.  See it for yourself and make your own call. Definitely recommended.",Battle Royale
162,thomas-hardcastle-2,This movie made me into a fan of cinema...,9,19 April 2008,"I don't think I had ever been affected by a film as much as I was the first time I saw this one. It can be seen as a film full of senseless violence, or it can be seen as a statement on the resolve of humankind, and the reactions of humans when placed in an inescapable, nightmarish situation. Could you kill your best friend? Some of the kids in this movie can't act, and that's quite obvious, even for someone watching it in subtitles. The players who CAN act, however, really CAN act.As usual, Takeshi Kitano plays a very understated character, but with three dimensions. He is superb as the teacher who introduces the class to Battle Royale.Some scenes in this film are ridiculous, to such an extent that you might laugh out loud, when you shouldn't. Some might call this a black comedy. I think it's a terrific horror story, essentially, as well as a critique on human nature.This is a terrific film, and a personal favourite of mine. The only person I know who doesn't like this film is my father, who thought it was just violence for the sake of violence. He likes Steel Magnolias, though, so his opinion is certainly questionable, to say the least.A word of warning: If you're going to get this movie, get the original cut, and not the Special Edition. The SE of Battle Royale is spoilt by a number of factors. For one, there was no need to add new scenes, like the basketball match. I felt these extras additions detracted from the overall dark feel of the piece, and I consider them to be completely unnecessary. They also make the film drag slightly. As well as this, there is the fact that the grey/dark blue filter used in the original cut of the film has been removed in the Special Edition, making the whole film appear more like a made-for-TV movie rather than a cinematic masterpiece.",Battle Royale

We could never make a film like this because of our prudish film industry. This movie had so much all out blood and violence that it made the whole viewing anxious.  In light of the tragedies at our public schools this would never be made in this country. But, give it to the Japanese for not hiding the bull****. If you want to see a really different movie find, if you can, Battle Royale. Best bet, use Ebay, like I did.  There are some lull moments but this is worth getting a hold of. BR Act.",Battle Royale
164,chribren,Japanese survival game at it's best,10,11 October 2013,"""Battle Royale"" is an 2000 Action/Thriller movie directed by known director Kinji Fukasaku (1930-2003), and produced/distributed by Toei Company. This film is based on the 1999 novel by Koushun Takami.Basic plot: A group of school people are taken to a remote island, where they all get forced to take part in a deadly game called Battle Royale lead by the Japanese government. And they all get each of their random items for use in the game. The game consists of some simple rules: Hunt down and kill each other until one survives. If more than one survive after three days, all of their neck collars explode. The same goes for anybody who refuses to take part in it. Among the school people are Shuya Nanahara (Tatsuya Fujiwara) and Noriko Nakagawa (Aki Maeda), close friends who don't want to kill each other. ""Beat"" Takeshi Kitano makes a notable appearance in this film as the teacher for the class chosen to take part in this game.Throughout the movie there are lots of graphic violence which often get bloody result. Sure, this film might not be everybody's cup of tea because of the violent and controversial content (speaking about the theme about high school students hunting down and killing each other), but if you really love watching such movies like I do, then I highly recommend this for you.This film has been released on DVD two times in Norway, the first time from Scanbox, and the second time by Star Media Entertainment. Both releases include both the theatrical cut and the extended cut, and are rated 18. The version I have on a French DVD copy only include the extended cut, which was the right version I was looking for. This is the version I wanna recommend you if you are gonna watch this.So actually, if you are into brutal and gory movies coming from Japan, then I recommend you to hunt this film down and buy it... ;-) Several other brutal movies from the same country include ""Ichi the Killer"", ""Izo"" and ""Tetsuo: The Iron Man"".",Battle Royale
165,Ben-Hibburd,Battle Royale Review.,8,11 January 2016,"Battle Royale is directed by Kinji Fukasaku. It's a film that tells the story of Japan in the near future, where the adults have become fearful of increasing violence from the youth of today. In a desperate attempt to curb rising crime, the Japanese government enact a new law, the Battle Royale act. In which a random class of school children are picked to participate. The rules, they have just three days on a remote island in which to kill each other, until the last person is standing. Otherwise they will all die. The film primarily follows Shuya Nanahara(Tatsuya Fujiwara) whose mother abandoned him and father recently committed suicide. He tries to find a peaceful solution too getting off the Island, but is faced with violence every time he comes across a fellow classmate.He is accompanied by Noriko Nakagawa(Aki Maeda) his girlfriend that he's vowed to protect at any cost. Along with another fellow survivor Shôgo Kawada(Tarô Yamamoto), our main trio have to navigate hostile terrain, also know as danger zones. That could instantly kill anyone that's present in them, and former friends who are trying to kill them.Battle Royale is a film that deals with subject matter that has both style and substance. It's also filled with fleshed out characters, they are all trying survive in the most hostile of environments. Unable to trust the people they once regarded as their best friends. It makes the viewer feel uneasy as to what a characters motivation is, at any given moment, whenever they inevitably stumble upon another character, although It usually brings about a grizzly end.Underneath the bloody surface of the film it also deals with the fear between adults and a generation of un-controllable youth, and the cultural divide that has grown between generations. The children don't wan't to grow up and become like their parents. Especially with the titular character Nanahara who doesn't want to become the failure that his father was. Whilst the adults can't seem find an effective response to the high levels of youth violence. This is highlighted with the main antagonist of the film Kitano-sensei(Takeshi Kitano) who in the opening scene is slashed by a pupil with a knife, and remains bitter all the way through the film, and feels as though the games are the only way to get through to the children. Despite himself regularly turning to violence.The film opens with 100's of journalist/TV crews trying to get a glimpse of the previous winner, whilst the game is never shown of TV, we are never given outside reactions other then from the characters inside the game. Which gives the film a mythical, tribal sensibility.",Battle Royale
166,joncheskin,Unfathomable Nightmare,5,30 September 2014,"Battle Royale is definitely either a love-it or hate-it proposition. The Japanese drama about a high-school class selected to be stranded on an island to kill each other in a game of last-man-standing is something like modern art of the 50s. You look at the painting and you think--gee this is a fascinating innovation OR oh my goodness, what a scam.Which is why I am going to buck the trend and give it five out of ten stars. I can honestly say that I have no idea whether it is any good. I can say, however, that it is interesting, for some reasons that I think others have not addressed.First of all, I think Battle Royale captures the quality of a genuine nightmare perhaps better than any film I have seen in a while. Clips come out of sequence and often in only tangential relation to reality. However, if you have ever been in a full blown nightmare, that is exactly how it is. For example, could you imagine being gassed on a bus on a field trip in high school, and then subjected to a lecture by your gym teacher in which several students are brutally killed BY THE TEACHER? This is bizarre nightmarishness at its best.People often talk about the dystopian aspect of the film, but unlike the Hunger Games, this is not the main point. Rather, the movie attempts to catalog the varied possible reactions of the participants to their unfathomable situation. In this, again the film does a really good job, because the reactions are varied and interesting, and even realistic (that is, when the film is not being blatantly satirical). The scenes always seem to reveal something interesting about teenagers, although you have to sit through remarkable blood and gore to find out what it is.Finally, this movie is really unfathomable in an endearing way. You simply don't understand it. The characters say as much. After lying on a bunk and semi-witnessing a scene in which five teenage girls gun each other down in a lighthouse, the main character screams, ""I don't --- --- understand this!!!"" Here perhaps is the main point of the film, and in both its story and its execution, the film is utterly consistent.Thus, I give it 5 out of 10, because it is unfathomable. However, I concede that, if that was the filmmaker's intention, 10 out of 10 would have been more appropriate.",Battle Royale
167,Sanou_san,"Chillingly riveting, unusual but very creative work piece",10,28 March 2010,"It's been a while since I saw ""Super Heroic Trio"" that made me numb and squirm (well I saw it when I was only 10 or 11) and this movie is another chance that made me feel that way, well a little lesser than the previous one. At first I thought the storyline and plot of Battle Royale was cheap, unconvincing and simply a product of bad casting, but I sit back, relaxed and watch the movie and attempt for a review myself. It turned pretty cool! I never thought this movie was full of story, misery, coolness and chilling creativeness. Imagine your country rankled by cruel, ironclad law passed forth for disciplinary cause. The Japanese actors were surreal their acting, well sometimes I judge it myself a little too rancid, but they've pulled of well the play and their role budge in coolly. This is the second time I saw Tatsuya Fujiwara on screen and I was even surprised that the strong, fierce, independent girl named Takako Chigusa was actually Chiaki Kuriyama, whom I first saw in Quentin's renowned Kill Bill. The dimension of each characters were fine, streamlined shortly, and even though their characters in the story were only short-lived I must say they've effectively strut their character well on screen. They've conveyed well the situation if one is faced with eminent dilemma that will surely shock your senses and spirit. They were just high school students, here comes the vindictive law enforcing strictly its mechanics and system, and they have no choice but to fight for their lives. One thing or another, they've really portrayed well their reactions though still stormed by their childhood memories and struggles. I loved the drama and action. Speaking of action it was, how do I put it, innocently superb! For their young age role they know how to wield convincingly weapons given to them, and it's a plus point for this movie on how they've successfully pulled that stunt. The message was fine, live and move forward, all in all they've wrapped everything brilliantly.",Battle Royale
168,Andres24,The worst movie I've ever seen,1,15 December 2002,"I went to the cinema three months ago to see a movie. And what did I see? Nothing.  Just Garbage.  OK.  Kitano. Why?, Goddam' money? Unbelievable. There isn't any script.  It says:  ""Life is a game.  So we have to kill each other."" So they went to an island and the massacre started till the end of the movie.  A lot of students monitored by Kitano. First, life is not a game.  Who can consider life a game?  Life is responsibility and other things but knot a game. Second, I can justify free random violence because everyone in this world, at least the worst creature hates violence. And I can justify violence due to the fact that life is not a game.  So the relation life-game-violence is wrong.  Look, I am not a doctor or whatever.  I am just a regular guy who went to see something and found nothing. Conclusion, it sucks.",Battle Royale
169,Mike Astill,"A good film, if you can stomach the content",8,8 September 2001,"In the near future, Japanese society is crumbling, and the blame lands on the shoulders of rebellious schoolchildren. To combat this menace, the Government create Battle Royale, selecting a class of children each year who are drugged, then dumped on an island where they must fight each other to the last boy or girl. Only one can walk away when the game is over.As the neatly suited boys and prim, loose-socked girls go about their grim slaughter the viewer is spared very little, and after a deluge of stabbings, shootings, decapitations and groin-stabbings only the sick-minded will remain unmoved. This is a film that will be impossible to forget. It's clearly a satire, although my meagre understanding of Japanese culture means that this aspect was lost on me for the most part. It's also been hailed as a black comedy, but that would be difficult to justify.Beat' Takeshi Kitano stars as the dispassionate schoolteacher watching over the slaughter of his students, and his air of calm menace is as unsettling as ever. The students themselves are a mixture of vulnerable innocents and desperate would-be killers, and it's to their credit that their noble and pathetic gestures add a real poignancy to the violence. As the fall, their names are displayed in subtitles, together with a grim reminder of how many more must die before the game is done.Having seen this on import VCD, convinced that there would be no chance of a theatrical release in the UK, I'm surprised to hear of its release. If you're planning to see it (and it IS a good film, if you can stomach the content), you might think about skipping the popcorn.",Battle Royale
170,RileyOnFilm,Better than the Hunger Games but a Similar concept,8,15 December 2018,"A bunch of prep school kids left to kill each other on a deserted Island. Hunger Games anyone? I have read that Quentin Tarantino wanted the lead from this show to star in ""Kill Bill"" because he loved this film so much. I wouldn't call it a ""Gore Fest"" as some have. After all, gore is when what's in the body is taken out and shown. This is a blood fest for sure though. The director is also very good at building suspense through music and sound effects.Action killing is something we like in America. That's probably why this scores so high on the democratic user score at IMDB. I found it exciting and cathartic. There will be those who will be turned off by the violence but it's a deeper message they miss. The ""teacher"" seems to have no compassion in him. One might compare him to Stanley Tucci's character in ""The Hunger Games."" It's not as much about the government but more about the risk of losing ones compassion for others. I think the teacher character may have done that. This is a fun watch but a bloody mess so be forewarned. I quite enjoyed it, 8/10.",Battle Royale
171,NDbportmanfan,"The Hunger Games, but With Violence",8,3 June 2016,"Battle Royale takes place in a near fictional future of Japan and is seen as a police state called the Republic of Greater East Asia. The population but most notably the younger population is not for this brand of governing and frequently rebels against authority. After enough instances the government devised a law that would force a junior high class (randomly selected out of 50) to participate in a fight to the death. This would be aired on television to scare the masses into obeying.Unlike the Hunger Games who primarily focuses on one member we see the stories of multiple players unfold, as well as their backstories. The plot is still focused on Shuya Nanahara more than not, as we see him trying to protect his friend from harm and find a way off the island without dying. This is extra tough as each player has a bomb strapped to his or her neck to make sure they don't do anything smart. You really do start to feel for the characters as the movie progresses as it does feel like junior high students were just put on an island to die (character development was really good).The story paces nicely as there is no feel of a rush to get to the conclusion and we understand the motivations of most of the 42 survivors. As well as their relationships with fellow classmates. Action sequences are pretty intense at times, which makes the N-15 rating all that more necessary. If you are a fan of bloody action films or just someone who saw Hunger Games and walked away feeling that they focused too much on the inter workings and the spectacle of the games then give this a try.",Battle Royale
172,varundelpiero,A surprisingly intelligent film; a reflection on Japanese culture...,8,26 January 2009,"Many have been quick to dismiss BATORU ROWAIARU as a tasteless gore-fest with little or no class or intelligence to speak of. The fact that the violence involves mostly teens adds to the sensitive/controversial nature of the film. Those who understand the position of Japanese society at the turn of the century will understand the deep-lying social implications of this film, and will revel in its ultimate brilliance. At the turn of the century, many Japanese adults were fast becoming afraid of the youth, who were becoming more and more uncontrollable and rebellious. This Motion Picture is a fantastic extension of the concept of Japanese teen violence.The movie is an altogether superb one, and is not as tasteless as many make it out to be. There is a reason why film great Quentin Tarantino lists this as one of his favourite films of all time.The acting, especially by relative newcomers Aki Maeda and Tatsuya Fuliwara is quite excellent, as is the story, direction by Kinji Fukasaku, and the overall atmosphere of the film.Thankfully, I saw the subtitled version, and not the dubbed one (if there is such a thing). Overall, a quite visceral and cerebral feast. 8/10. 3 stars (out of 4). Should enter my Top 150 at 145. Highly recommended.",Battle Royale
173,Healing_Process,"One of those, ""have to get it"" kind of movies.",7,15 February 2014,"Battle Royal was not necessarily bad in a sense it just had a very Japanese gore like mentality to it. Put Japanese culture, mixed with young kids, mixed with people dying and you get a super melodramatic gore fest. There are people out there that enjoy movies like this and I can never fully understand it. This movie wasn't bad per se, but its not something to watch repetitively or put any higher than a 7. You will enjoy this movie if you like shoot em up movies, Japanese culture, character infatuation, or melodramatic emotional scenes. But considering all the other corners of movies making and storyline he falls short. Its meant to be what it is and nothing more. You will either like it from what I have stated or you will not.

There are bits in this movie which to be honest, i felt like throwing up about, it is sick, it is violent and it is also a bloody good movie.*WARNING!!* *THERE ARE SPOILERS AHEAD!* *WARNING*Ok, now that THATS out of the way, i couldn't really believe what i was watching when i saw this movie, it was fast paced, it was soo dark humored and many a time did this movie make me want to just get up and walk out of it but i didn't and i watched this movie till the end.Several of the sections in this movie were just unbelievable, and what made it ten times worse was the fact that all the people taking part in this were children of around 15 years old, if they were around 10 years older then perhaps it would have been more in ""context"" but this movie...One of the scenes which really sickened me beyond all belief was the lighthouse scene, the 4/5 girls are all friends and they all think that they will make it out together, and one stupid girl decides to get revenge on the main character leads to a bloody massacre and you can see several of these girls minds just flipping out during this scene, i couldn't watch most of this yet i did and GOD i wished that i didn't.Another scene which i personally thought was really bad was the scene in which the girl with the taser and the ""beautiful"" girl meets. I don't know why this would upset me soo much but it did, it was nothing on the magnitude of which the kitchen scene upset me but it did :(This movie was made in Japan and i'm glad that it was made there, i don't honestly see how it could have been made anywhere else with such an impact and i think that it was banned in the US because it was so disgusting. I don't think that this movie was something for everyone, but it was something that people should watch and also think about, it makes u think that in the situations in which these children were in could u do what they were doing? I'm not sure if i could kill myself or bring myself to kill other people but in this movie these children don't really have a choice, it is the most simple law of the jungle ""survival of the fittest"" and also ""kill or be killed"" Personally, i'm not sure what i could do and i'm not sure if i would want to do it.When i walked out of the cinema after seeing this i realized that this movie does make u think about things in a different aspect, u can't walk away from this movie and NOT think differently about things, most importantly, u have to think about urself and whether or not you could survive in the situation in which these children are in. I'm not sure if i could.This movie is absolutely great, i would recommend it to any of my friends with a strong stomach and also those who have a brain, this isn't a typical slasher flick, it is NOT full of bimbos with big tits and muscle men, the deaths in this are not clean cut and they are also not short and sweet, they are prolonged and show you how death is, ugly. Plain and simple ugly. See this movie and consider your own reaction to it, but please see it.",Battle Royale
177,freydis-e,Total waste of a brilliant idea. Read Golding's 'Lord of the Flies' instead.,3,13 June 2015,"I looked forward to this movie, praised by some critics and based around a brilliant core idea. In fact it's incoherent nonsense from start to finish. This review contains MAJOR SPOILERS – if you haven't seen it, this is intended to stop you wasting your time.Japanese psychological horror leads the world, with brilliantly original and superbly realised and acted films like 'Ring' and 'Audition'. The basic idea here – confining a class of high-school kids on an island and forcing them to kill each other till only one remains – is good enough to produce a worthy addition to the genre. But even the idea itself isn't used sensibly. The movie is set in a future Japan where violence is rife and respect for authority has broken down, especially in the young. Why these Battle Royales should help reverse this trend is anyone's guess. Indeed it's hard to see how they can affect anything at all since the classes seem to be chosen at random to take part, the contest isn't, as might be expected, shown on TV, all contestants but one end up dead, and even that one seems to get shipped back in to be killed off in some later battle. In terms of a plot there's not much more than that.There are about fifty kids on the island, but there's hardly any back-story, and none of the friendships, enmities, rivalries or hero-worship which every school class has and even the shallowest teen-flick delivers to some extent. Apart from boys having crushes on girls and vice versa, there's no real attempt at characterisation as most of the fifty are given brief, usually immediately-pre-death cameos, and it's hard to care about any of them. The only ones who get any screen-time are a stereotype brave hero boy and a stereotype super-feeble girl with a line in homespun philosophy straight out of the Hollywood book of clichés. Most of the (near-constant) violence is taken care of by two irrelevant outsiders, older boys. One of these is a characterless and thoroughly pointless villain, who wanders round ignoring all the bullets and other weapons that hit him and firing, almost continuously, an inexhaustible machine gun. The clever tag-line 'could you kill your best friend' becomes irrelevant because, in fact, this guy kills almost everyone. The other outsider is another stereotyped hero, who, in a major cop-out ending, rescues our innocent couple from the island so that they never need to think about killing anyone, or facing up to the fascinating moral issues involved in this situation.The kids and B-list Japanese TV-actors involved here are mostly unconvincing, but one or two of the young actors do pretty well in the circumstances: the boy blown away by a frightened girl because he's never had the nerve to tell her he fancies her; the girl athlete threatened with rape, who's soon in hot pursuit of her terrified assailant; the class bitch who decides to go out and win the game and gives it a pretty reasonable shot. Unfortunately these don't include any of the leads. Even the action isn't done that well. The psycho villain approaches every fight in the same silly way, while a group of schoolgirls, who can never have seen a gun before, dive around spectacularly, firing off volleys of shots like trained Navy SEALS drafted into a Tarantino movie.Plenty of people have enjoyed this film – just look at these reviews and the ridiculously high rating – but why? Is it all the young Japanese women wearing mini-skirted school uniforms? (The fact that only one of them manages to change into more suitable clothing has nothing whatever to do with the plot.) Or is it the endless stream of graphic violence? I guess if coverage of real schoolgirls fighting to the death were screened on TV, there'd be people who'd want to see it. By all means enjoy this if it's what turns you on, but please don't try to pretend it's anything more than mindless exploitation.Is there nothing good about this film? Actually just one thing. The hypnotic Chiaki Kuriyama, her considerable talents wasted in one of those tiny cameos, nonetheless did the job well enough to get noticed and get herself drafted into a real Tarantino movie, giving us, as mace-wielding Gogo, the highest of high-points in 'Kill Bill'.William Golding's 'Lord of the Flies', a book based on a similar concept, is one of the great novels in English and has been translated into Japanese and every other major language. The makers of this film should have read it before they wasted this brilliant idea. Please give it a try before (or hopefully instead of) wasting your time on this garbage.",Battle Royale
178,bulleetz37235,Relentless,9,18 April 2006,"Japanese cinema at it's best.Battle Royale is amazing. A relentless film about the falling school system in Japan, and the murderous BR act designed to solve the woes of society.It follows a bus full of students who are gassed and then taken to an island. They wake up in a building all dazed and confused wondering where they are, and to find two new people who are obviously students, but don't belong to their school.Then in comes the military, and an old school teacher to inform them of todays lesson. Battle Royale.They are told the rules: *There are collars around their neck, if they try and remove them by any means, they will explode and kill them. *They are set to go out into the island with bags of kit they need, and then they are to kill each other, until only one remains. *If everyone has not been killed within 3 days, the game will end and all collars will explode. Meaning no winners. *During play danger zones will be activated. If in one for too long, the collars will explode - designed to make them enter the same zones, so they get opportunity to kill. *They will have random weapons.---After the very 'classroom' like introduction from the teacher, they are sent out into the island with their bags. All 42 of them.Some take to the battle straight away, killing to survive, but often becoming victims themselves. Other commit suicide, refusing to fight. One trio (our main group of protagonist students) take off together with the idea of staying alive, without killing. There are also two psychopathic individuals, hunting for kills - for thrills.---The theme of the film is easy to understand, and the killing is a lot of fun to watch, in a sick sort of way. The plot is intriguing, as you are always wondering how it will end.I'm not gonna spoil that though. It's a pretty weird ending though. The final point about the film is, that I like how it moves on reverting back and forth from specific character's requiems of the past. It not only gives more depth to the players, but also helps establish who we like and want to survive. and who we hate and want to die.It's amazing, provoking and imaginative. Highly recommended.",Battle Royale

The novel upon which it was based (which i read after hearing about the movie) had it's share of problems (the characters were almost absurdly one-dimensional, for one thing), but it still would have served the film well to have stuck much more closely to the source material. Some of the things that were changed were just outright awful, and the film certainly didn't improve upon any of the weaknesses of the book (weak characterization on the page = weaker characterization on screen). But still, the premise of the story practically guarantees a certain level of watch-ability, so it wasn't a complete waste. I just wish they had kept it closer to the book...",Battle Royale

181,Nigel St. Buggering,Proof that the truly gutsy films are being made elsewhere,9,18 October 2001,"When I see a film like this, it throws the entire American filmmaking engine into sharp focus for me; just how gutless, bottom-line-driven and lowest-common-denominator-based it has become.""Battle Royale"" presents us with an incredibly ugly concept, and has the courage to follow through with it.  It probably takes multiple viewings to fully appreciate it, and hopefully I'll have the chance to see it in a format other than the low-quality video CD that presented my first experience with it.  But despite the pixelated picture, mediocre sound, and jerky motion, I was deeply affected, which I suppose is a testament to its power.While we here in America could easily see this as a statement on school violence and reality television (as I thought it was going in), I think that it is more accurately an allegory on teen angst; how romantic and social dynamics seem so overwhelming and important to the young and inexperienced that they feel like life-and-death dilemmas.  And here, they literally are.The killings are extraordinary in their brutality; scenes we've watched a hundred times before become brand new when the subjects are ninth-grade schoolchildren.  What's really scary is that they're very believable in their incredible situation.  Even while pointing deadly weapons at one another, they're still strangely concerned with their crushes and their social dynamics, sometimes making them the justifications for their acts. At no point does the story go soft on its messages of trust and loyalty, and it can be pretty horrifying to behold.I suppose that those who remember their teen years as idyllic and carefree may find themselves failing to understand this film; But anyone who remembers the social meat grinder of early adolescence will recognize the underlying truths found here.  Not since ""Carrie"" have I seen a film-maker so successfully use fantastic allegory to explore universal truths about school culture.  It's a pity that this film's contraversy prevented it from wider distribution, as I think that it's messages are not unique to Japanese culture.

If you are able to get passed that then you'll be treated to a very violent and entertaining film. You get to watch as the ticker counts down 41 students as the die one by one. There are a bunch of flash backs and a little bit of a introduction that gives us a bit of an idea who these kids are and what their personalities are before we have to watch them all die. Its quite brutal and relentless in its violence(especially the scene where everything is being explained to the class and some of the students are used as demonstrations to how things work) but also has a very small amount of cheesiness to it. Some of the people get shot a bunch of times and then hop back to their feet to fight some more.

It shows us a Japan torn between the older generation's obsession with order and obedience, and the younger generation's ideas of personal freedom and expression.

Why is their old school teacher in charge of the army (what do they do for other classes in other years, do they find their old school teachers too?)

189,nickthegun,gutsy and original (couldnt be hollywood),8,20 February 2003,"Battle Royale is one of those rare films that grabs you from the get go.Set in a Day after tomorrow' type future, Japan has gone to the dogs. In a theme familiar to a lot of Japanese films, the kids just aint right. They skip school and (shock) talk back to teachers. The government must do something, so they come up with the Battle Royale bill. Its not made too clear what the point of it is, but I assume its to make naughty kids straighten up and fly right for fear they will be next. Either that or its just a good way of keeping the bad boy population down.Anyhow, what it all means is that a class gets trapped on an island and have to use any means to trim their population down to one. If there is more than one survivor left at the end of 3 day game' then their running man style head bands explode (unlike the running man, they don't blow the head off, they pack just enough punch to sever the throat and shower everyone with blood). After waking up from being drugged, the starring class find themselves in a classroom (floors ominously covered in plastic) and are told the rules of the game by a hilarious  info video. After much gnashing and wailing they are sent on their way with a survival pack and a weapon. Some of the weapons suck (lid from a pan) some don't (hand grenades).As the children get about their business, we see their personalities develop. The bitch, the good girl, the brain and the good guy are all there, with their stories to tell. After their stories are told, they are usually dispatched with and we are then given a running total of the casualties.One thing that works in BRs favour is that it is constantly inventive. New ways to die, graphics, story telling devices and such.  Its never boring.BR tells a good story. Admittedly there are a few plot holes (what happens in the danger zones'?), but all in all it keeps you going to the end. Beat' is very good too. As deadpan as you would expect, but emitting a strange empathy. Its not quite the visceral attack on the senses we are lead to believe it is, however it is genuinely entertaining and it does make a lot of good ideological points.",Battle Royale
190,Eradan,Impossible To Take Seriously On Any Level.,1,27 April 2016,"Battle Royale is crude violence-porn masquerading as clumsy satire. The satiric aspect of BR (which an amazing number of fanboys take seriously) is ridiculous. This movie is set in the near-future in modern Japan. Only a complete fool could think anything like this is remotely possible. The heavy-handedness of BR's satire is bizarre in the context of the absurd premise.With three exceptions, the characters are effeminate boys and brittle, fluffy females who are utterly unbelievable as juvenile offenders. These silly little poseurs wouldn't stand out in any suburban high school in the US and would be eaten alive in any inner-city school. The exceptions are a clichéd ""thrill killer"" type named Kiriyama, an angsty stereotype named Kawada, and Mitsuko who as written is a somewhat believable female psychopath. Frankly, she seems to have come from a completely different movie.So much for the themes and the characters, as for the plot, Battle Royale is the kind of bad action movie that features stupid people doing stupid things over and over and being (sometimes) saved from the consequences by ridiculous plot twists. Characters are shot repeatedly and then immediately get up and start moving around again or, in the case of femme boytoy, Shuya Nanahara, survive after getting a sucking chest wound bandaged by a pretty girl. It's all impossible to take seriously on any level.",Battle Royale
191,MercurioKnight,Survival and Death becomes all there is... How would you escape it?,9,4 October 2002,"An expressive film, with some harrowingly disturbing images and ideas put together, well shot, and well acted... It makes one wonder, if I was in that situation, how would I react to it? It also goes over many of those reactions, bringing humanity to the characters and horror to the situation.
The intro brings up one of the most disturbing images in the film (which I'll let you experience for yourself), and is a sign of what's to come; a gritty struggle for survival, as some band together to find a solution, others are brutal in their ploys to be the last one standing. What unfolds is a gripping, harsh story about the youth of today and where it might one day head if someone gets the wrong idea on how to 'deal' with them. The scariest part, I don't think it's very farfetched in its approach.With the past containing the cruel touch of the Holocaust, Slavery, as well as American Indian mass genocide (bringing in clothing and cloths purposely wrought with diseases, and much worse)... Governments formed along the lines of corrupted communism, while others hold tight to their ruthless secret agencies. Is it hard to imagine some deluded person in charge somewhere being responsible for such an act to bring forth this madness and travesty?It reminded me a bit of Lord of the Flies taken to the Nth Power... especially towards the end of LOTF, where the boys have lost control, and one of them is being hunted down, fearful for his life. Battle Royale has it's own depressing undertone with a resounding hope, it's brutal and powerful filmmaking. I was there, with them, sharing their horrors, questioning my own ability to survive under such circumstances... and in 7th and 9th grades? I couldn't even fathom it. One note, I'm glad they didn't slick it up with the 'press' angle, flashy graphics and the like making it silly and undermining the point of the film by displaying the 'game' as some sort of sport (the video talking about the nature of the game is enough, trying to unrest the children even more as it sends them on their way).. They kept it for the most part real from the students' viewpoints, expressing their horror (and with them, ours). Other films that attempted going overboard with the press ultimately destroys much of the effect of the brutality (Natural Born Killers, Series 7, even to a minor extent the Rollerball films), which makes me hate those films that much more for treating life like a piece of candy, to be eaten and thrown away.  No, not so with BR. I didn't read any reviews on it, I'd heard of it through friends, but just enough to wet my curiosity. It's best to go in fresh, and let it effect you. Too many people in this modern age are too afraid to let a film really grab hold of them, so they wall it up inside and end up losing the point and ultimately what makes the film work. Be receptive, find a copy online and buy it. Don't look back, and when you feel you're in a state of mind ready to loosen up, pop it in and faze out everything else.
There is so much to go into, yet I don't want to ruin any of it... so, if you've seen it, e-mail me with your thoughts and we'll discuss it further.",Battle Royale

I will just say that this film is brilliant in story, well acted (yes even though it's in Japanese), and visually stunning.  This is an extremely violent film, which is why it is not easy to come by in America.

193,Unicorn-9,Lord of the Flies with machineguns and a touch of Monty Python,10,6 October 2002,"""Good morning! Time for sleepy heads to wake up! Heres the list of your dead friends in the order they died...""Excellent movie, particularly in the extended 'Special Edition' version which explains the character motivations much better; but, at the same time, with extra blood and a revised soundtrack, makes the violence rather more brutal than in the original version. What really made the movie for me though was that it wasn't just another excuse for a violent teen death spree, but was filled throughout with a strong undercurrent of black humor. In particular, while my girlfriend thinks I'm a freak, I find Kitano's painting absolutely hilarious; the idea that he'd sit there through all these events painting something like that reaches practically Pythonesque levels of surrealism, and the educational video, Kitano's body-count comments on the speakers, the sequences with the soldiers lined up outside his headquarters and the umbrella sequence aren't far behind.Another interesting aspect is that it's never as black and white as a typical American movie; only the 'nutter' is a cardboard character you never feel anything for... at one point I even felt myself rooting for Mitsuko, although she'd killed off several sympathetic characters beforehand, and Kitano himself is more screwed up than evil. I may not like all the characters, but I can understand most of them... and it does a fair job in fleshing out 42 characters even though most of them only get a few minutes on-screen and much of their dialog is as banal as you'd expect in a teenage melodrama.On the downside, as others have pointed out, there are a lot of holes: not much once the kids are on the island, but explaining why they're there, why they don't know why they're there, and why they're left alone rather than followed reality-TV fashion; I found it easier to just ignore that fact and accept that they were there for whatever reason they were there. Also, of course, there's the, um, virginity angle that people have mentioned... like most guys, I think if I was a teenager in that situation I'd be more than little interested in having a good time before I died. And the ending seems to drag on a little; I don't think the movie really needs the final scene at the end unless it's a setup for a sequel. However, that said, I thought the extended post-ending sequence of flashbacks in the 'Special Edition' added to the movie even though they seemed to be shots that were left on the cutting room floor in the original version: in particular, Kitano's final words in that version of the movie summed up much of what the movie was about. Aside from the points about friendship, trust and sacrifice, it's about a future -- or perhaps a present -- where adults and kids have grown so apart that parents kill their kids because they just don't know how to talk to them anymore.Otherwise good idea, good cinematography, good soundtrack, some kind of message, and Japanese schoolgirls in shootouts with machineguns (Satomi is just the cutest :))... what more could you want in a movie?",Battle Royale

195,kingtanichi,Unleash the fury,8,16 October 2003,"<<Possible Spoilers>>Battle Royale, as everybody has already said, is a movie that would NEVER get made in Hollywood. Actually I think it's not so much the point of kids having to kill each other that would never go through (it could be marketed as ""Lord of the Flies for the new millennium""), but the incredibly realistic approach it takes to the material. Hollywood's attempt at profundity would be to have all the kids succumb to the bestial, primal urge to kill, and then offset this with some sex scenes. In other words, they would rob the material of its power by trying to make it seem ""fun.""Kinji Fukusaku is infinitely more subtle. While some of the kids indeed do embrace the carnage, others seek desperately for a way to escape (mostly boys), others simply group together as friends and hide (mostly girls), and others simply commit suicide right away as the best way out. Come to think of it, maybe we should stop damning American cowardice. Perhaps Japan is the ONLY country in the world that could make this movie.As I write this, I am six days away from my eighteenth birthday -- barely older than the protagonists of this film. I saw the movie with my university film society a few weeks ago. The part that threw me most was that I always identified with the people on the screen; the ones who ran, the ones who hid, the ones who died, and (with one exception who you'll know when you see) those who killed.

197,cat-that-goes-by-himself,"Cool down everyone, this movie is a joke",7,7 September 2006,"Don't get me wrong: I rather like this movie. By 'joke' I mean it must not be taken seriously. Reading both enthusiastic and spiteful reviews on this site, I think both reveling in the first degree bloodbath or expressing contempt or disgust for the extreme violence displayed are far too literal interpretations.This movie is like a giant prank, like ""what about a killer party with real weapons?"". Granted, the idea may seem a bit sick, but even though I'm no Japan expert, I think one should bear in mind the difference in representation of violence between different cultures. After all, from John Wayne to Mel Gibson we are sort of used to the sight of a hero slaughtering pretty dumb German/Japanese/Vietnamese soldiers by the dozen, and as far as respect for human life is concerned I reckon the fact that they are faceless ennemies makes a very thin difference. Only the judeo-Christian culture does not welcome killing when it's up close and personal, contrary to the Japanese one.So if we put the fictional killing aside, I think this movie explores some other aspects of perfectly real violence in Japanese society: difficult family life, pressure on kids to get the best degrees, heavy social hierarchy, restriction of individual initiative. I think the extreme and completely artificial situation the kids are facing is simply a way to sketch some caricatures of typical Japanese social behaviors.Look for instance at one of the first scenes: a kid comes home to find the dead body of his father. The man hung himself while wearing a huge banner encouraging his son to pass his national exam. That pretty much sets the tone of the movie. Nothing to write home about as far as subtlety is concerned, but still not simply a meaningless collection of killings.Some of the students will cling to rigid social behaviors, while other will break the rules with more or less enjoyment. That is just a convenient mean to illustrate these social stereotypes. The trick is not new, being the base of about every single plane crash, ship wreck or faulty tower movie ;) (and of the good war movies, but these are unfortunately not so numerous as one could think).This being said, I do not consider this movie a masterpiece. It is pretty well filmed, has some interesting points about Japan recurrent problems, the acting is not bad at all and it *does* contain a good dose of humor, although very dark and slightly perverted at times. I am sure some bits remain out of my reach due to cultural distance, which may explain why I found the movie a tad bit heavy and repetitive at times.An also please stop splitting hairs about any moral content: IMHO there simply is none. No lessons in the end. Neither glorification nor condemnation of violence. Just over the top caricatures of human interactions in the very specific context of Japanese culture. Did I say this movie was a joke already?Even though I totally respect people who were disgusted by the 1st degree of violence in this movie, I think viewing it from a distance may be a more rewarding experience.

Beautifully shot and acted, with characters you actually care about and don't want to see killed off. That was something that I hadn't seen in quite some time. Many recent films feature characters that are bland, boring and forgettable. You don't care whether they get filled off or survive. It has even become a trend in recent years to ""root for the killer"". Not in this film – the entire 'game' is so absurd and the 'contestants' so young and looking forward to life ahead of them. You root for them. At least for those sane ones.This film is bloody and gory like no other. But compared to stupid torture porn flicks, the violence is not meaningless.

200,peterlane5,Pretty bloody and at times disturbing but also beautiful,8,27 February 2011,"A brutal and at times disturbing Drama/Thriller. I wouldn't call it an action movie because it's so much more than that. As violent as it is, it is also beautiful in a way. Plot: In the near future society is on the verge of collapse. School children boycott schools and begin rioting. Out of fear and desperation to regain control, the Japanese government passes an act that as punishment the chosen students must fight to the death on a deserted island in a reality show type game until there is only one left alive. This chronicles a chosen 9th grade class. Some give up immediately by suicide, others band together and try to find a way off the island, while some just enjoy the killing. Be warned this is a very violent and bloody film(but it isn't really any more bloody than Kill Bill: Vol 1). The whole concept of teenagers being pitted against each other to fight to the death is disturbing but it raises the questions; ""How far would you go to survive? Would you kill your best friend or sacrifice yourself to save them?"" Despite it's violence, this is a pretty good movie. This movie shows that even in the worst of situations a bond can be formed that will never be broken. Most of the characters are well developed and it's sad to see most of them meet a violent end. While watching the movie, I got a ""Lord of the Flies"" vibe from it and anyone who has read the book has to check this out. I really enjoyed the ending, it's touching and I don't want to spoil anything but it ends on a sort of happy note. and I will say this I shed a tear.

201,kane_1371-117-231060,Not a masterpiece but indeed worth a watch,6,30 January 2017,"So I finally watched BR after all this time and I feel that the hipsters are really at it with this one. This movie hardly is a masterpiece 10 out of 10 title, it is above average at best. The best thing with BR is not its over the top cheesy action scenes but the very story it portrays about the younger generation lost and an aging nation that as I am writing this review is having a higher mortality rates than birth rates. Japan is a polite country, with a culture based on politeness and this culture is constantly at clash with the western values and the influence it has on its youth. This has led to a gap that is separating the youth of the past two decades from the older people of the nation, to add to this Japan has also turned into the land of virgins with many young people skipping the whole procreation act and the relationship etc altogether. So you can imagine that the actual story the movie is telling you is not about the disrespectful teens towards their elders but this divide in place that is sending the Japanese society towards some really dangerous spirals. No this movie is not about how teenagers would act if they got their hands on guns as some reviews claim. This isn't either some knock on the kind of entertainment the Japanese people enjoy (comics, games, anime, baseball etc) as yet some other reviews claim. This is pointing the finger at both sides. This is why this movie is important in some sense. However as mentioned before this is not a masterpiece and there are some reasons behind it. For example the acting is pretty shoddy and just weird. The story seems to actually skip the realities of such a situation. I was honestly very surprised that rape was barely a part of story. The fact that there are that many teenagers without any boundaries gives any of these teens with their crazy hormones the complete power and reason to do commit rape. While I don't say all of them would commit such a heinous act but there would be an inevitable incident. Something that I enjoyed was all the weird moments when a waltz was played throughout the movie. It was just completely weird and yet good enough to make me laugh.

205,DanStarkey,sick and twisted but compelling,8,4 April 2004,"Battle Royale is a sick and twisted film full of gratuitous gore that provides a voyeuristic view into the world of the sadist. One views from a safe position behind the lens as children brutally murder each other. Technically, the movie is extremely well made, which creates a strong compulsion to keep watching. The plot makes no sense at all - the whole point of the ""BR act"" is to somehow act as instruction to children, yet, despite being in force for several years - all but two of the 42 children have never heard of it. But the plot really doesn't matter, as the film is really just a series of vignettes of each bloody killing. Battle Royale provides a window into the darker side of Japanese culture and institutions that has produced such memorable moments as the Rape of Nanking and the Bataan Death March. Given the success in Japan of this movie and the novel on which it is based, this evil tendency would appear to be still lurking in the Japanese psyche.",Battle Royale

A class of kids thinks they are going on a field trip only to be taken to a military controlled island. They are told that they have three days to kill everyone. Only one may survive and go home. They are each given a pack with some provisions,a weapon,and a map. The weapons vary and some of the kids get the shaft. For instance, one kid may get an axe while another gets a pot lid. Also there are periodic announcements issuing danger zones so the kids have to keep moving. Another plus to this film is it features the lovely Chiaki Kuriyama who you may know as the actress who was known as Go Go Yubari on ""Kill Bill Vol.1"". This movie has it all.

207,jonny_mcclatch,My personal favourite film.,10,30 May 2019,"I've always wanted to review films so I feel the best place to start is with my own favourite. I've watched countless films in my lifetime, including a lot of classics and cult classics. So many might think, well of all the films you've ever watched why is this your favourite one?I'm not going to say it's the perfect movie, like all movies it does have it's flaws and in Battle Royale's case it does have oddities which you may or may not enjoy. But for me it has the perfect mix of what I look for in a film/story and in my opinion it's done in the right way. The film is based off of a book which was later turned into a manga and eventually lead to this film. One of the few flaws about it is that the source contains a vast amount of individual characters and trying to condense all of them down to fit into a film that is under two hours long. It does mean that some character deaths seem to be placed into the film and you don't feel connections to those characters. But it's important to think back to the context that the film lines up.Essentially we find out that a class is chosen for the BR act and they are kidnapped and instructed to kill their classmates until they're the last man standing or alternatively everyone will be killed via an exploding neck collar. The question the movie always poses is what would someone do in that situation and we are given several ideas. Some students refuse to play the game and don't wish to kill their friends or the person they love so instead take their own lives, others decided they're very much willing to win to save themselves and have reasons for their thinking. Kazuo is a psychopath who volunteered and presumably enjoys killing on that basis. Whereas someone like Mitsuko is part of the class but she feels that she has been a victim her entire life it's hinted that she has been abused throughout her life and in the end she has had enough. We only find out as she is killed by Kazuo that this is the case which is a twist that really makes you feel sorry for her after she has been made out to be one of the main villains to that point of the film. The final group of people are those who don't want to kill their friends and instead try to win the game with their friends or just survive as long as possible with each other.We see different outcomes of this as well, some run into either Mitsuko or Kazuo and don't make it. Another group get suspicious of each other and in the end turn on each other, and we have our main characters who care for each other and keep their promise to survive together. The film covers a lot of or scenarios and possibilities and I could easily write a book on everything about it. That is one of the reasons it is my favourite, there is a lot of story and background for a lot of the characters. It has a lot of action and with most things in the film it makes you think about something. Even the ending isn't a plain happy ending, you feel good about it for a few reasons but you also feel bad for other reasons and that's down to getting to know some of the characters so well. On top of that the film is well cast, Tatsuya Fujiwara was in the live action version of Deathnote, Takeshi Kitano is probably the most famous cast member within Japan. But i'd say Chiaki Kuriyama is the most recognisable to general movie fans around the world thanks to her contribution in Kill Bill as Gogo Yubari.It's impossible not to draw parallels between this and The Hunger Games although in saying that I feel Battle Royale is the far superior film, I understand that being in Japanese and subtitled makes it less desirable to the english speaking world but it is worth it. For years I put off foreign cinema, but looking back it restricts you from seeing a lot of great movies especially with Hollywood now backtracking and simply recycling old ideas and old movies.",Battle Royale
208,Horror-88,Book was heaps better,8,16 October 2017,"""You just have to fight for yourself; no one's going to save you. That's just life, right?""The original novel of 'Battle Royale' is amongst my favourite books, so I obviously had high expectations for the movie. Like anyone who's read a book before watching its adaptation, I was disappointed. The movie is entirely different to its source material - 90% of scenes were left out, and some additional plot points were added. The deep look into every character's life and personality - which was the reason why the book was so good - was almost entirely absent in the movie. Where in the book you could sympathise and become emotionally attached to all characters (including the villains), the movie was so rushed I could barely keep track of what was happening. The novel explored deep themes about humanity, violence and fear. This was pretty much absent in the film. It's fair to say this is like any adaptation ever, so I tried to review the movie as if I'd never read it before, thus the 8/10 star rating. The movie might not be too great, but the book is a masterpiece.",Battle Royale
209,Tubular_Bell,"Like a live action anime. A very, very bad anime.",3,7 October 2012,"A lesson learned: be VERY careful with Japanese films with English titles. No, ""Battle Royale"" is not a translated title: apparently the Japanese think that English titles are very clever.Indeed, the film is the product of someone who thinks he's a lot, lot more clever than he actually is. Nothing about the film's premise, the plot, the character, is inspiring or interesting at all. This is the ""bloodshed"" equivalent of Avatar: you've seen it all before, yet you're supposed to take it at face value.I can understand bloody action films when they're meant to entertain. Really, I do. I'm not offended by ""dumb entertainment"". The problem with Battle Royale is that it is the most shallow, most air-headed, most pretentious and dumb kind of ""smart film"" out there. You're supposed to take it as a serious social commentary, but there is no commentary at all. There's no real point to the movie. Yet, it's impossible to enjoy it as a ""pointless fun"" film, because it is simply not fun. It's made not to be fun. It is designed to be gritty, serious and terrifying. Worse: it feels like a live action anime, with a bombastic, over-the-top soundtrack, overly gory death scenes, annoying (and sometimes random) title cards and so on. It doesn't even feel like actual cinema. It's devoid of any artistic merit.In other words, this is pure, unadulterated Mystery Science Theater 3000 material. If you like staging your own ""RiffTrax"" sessions, pick this one. Trust me: it's every bit as stupid as the premise makes it look like. But on the positive side, you'll probably give another thought about all the filmmakers you considered ""hacks"" in the past. If you thought Kill Bill was a pile of garbage, watch this one, and you'll probably enjoy that one a lot more.",Battle Royale
210,GDovW,Really not as good as i remembered from my teenage years,3,4 May 2020,"In my memories, the movie was full of action, and a background story just enough to explain why the BR Act was on (and the reason to get those kids kill each other); and i often liked Takeshi Kitano's movies (i haven't watched any from him since 2005). It was a cult movie!
After just watching it again (5 min later i'm writing this review) Wow ! What a bad movie, with really bad actors (i know there is the Asian style of acting - but honestly, quite a lot of them are really bad at acting), a really bad editing, and ridiculous special effects (mostly just red paint on clothes - reminds me of the 1980s movies) ... And the end story? Oh my ...... so pointless!The background stories (to try and make us connect with the characters) are just useless ... after the 2nd one, i just skipped them ... as well as the end that i fast forwarded.Sure, watch it to know what it is about; but don't have high expectations. And if you think you could pass on this one, do it. You will find more drama and better acting in BR-style video games :D",Battle Royale
211,K-nightt,We were all children one day,5,11 December 2009,"Sorry.. didn't work for me... I certainly get the point though. This life is nothing if not predictable in it's utterly cruel way of recurring behavioral patterns. The key-words nowadays are ""cool"" and ""hip"" forms of parenting, in a ridiculous attempt to identify with the up and coming generations of alienated youths. Boundaries are blurred. Parents abandon their stoic posture and yield to hedonism, refuting egregiously their years of experience. When purposeful regression takes center stage, all hell will break loose. So, when haughty, hormone-driven adolescents see that they have their affection-deprived parents on their knees, a greater sense of already-gargantuan entitlement takes over. And this extends into the every sphere of life, especially in social gatherings, and even more in the classroom, where hiding under the surface of blatant infantile behavior lies intensely insecure thought processes. Anyway, the fabric of school tries to institute a neo-superego, but since the primordial one has been vanquished, why should this one be allowed to prevail??? It shouldn't, that's why students just don't care, and their parents are too afraid of losing their children completely (a cataclysmic death of self as well, since children are the redefinition of their rebirth) and simply don't choose to emphasize the importance of education. The movie tried to take the side of the kids, giving everyone a brief background that tries to be inspiring... it vilifies some of them as well so we know who to cheer against (there is an ineffectual attempt to humanize the girl with the scythe by showing her brush with a potential child molester). Now, the solution in this case is pure fascism, and it is a very moronic way of looking at life. The reason we have so many school shootings and whatnot in the US is because the culture causes a spiritual suffocation and death, there is no room for negotiation, there are no shades of gray, so extreme behaviors are adopted to get the point across. Here, it's the same thing, adopting radical dogmas for a much deeper-seeded behavioral issue that derives from the adults' lack of insight into self and how to raise their kids... bah... I usually try to stick with the story in my reviews, not focusing on technical aspects. Unfortunately, I must comment, the acting was very poor.. I love to be drawn into the realm of the film, but I simply couldn't because none of it rang true or believable. Anyway, in essence, an unnecessary statement which echoes the dumb way the world perceives its problems, and the primitive way it intends to resolve them.",Battle Royale
212,Snownoise,A rip-off that claims others rip-offs,1,6 March 2021,"Given store is 1, but the actual score I would give is 7.This movie is certainly well made and entertaining. Typical Manga or anime styles of characters and actions are very well edited into the survival game genre and that makes it very interesting. While I was watching the movie, I could notice some similarities of other movies too. Hey, this looks like Lord of the flies. Oh, this looks like Running man. This is definitely from one of the Stephen King's novels, and etc. The movie ended and the time well spent. It's a nice survival game movie. I probably won't watch it again though, and the life goes on... But then ever since this movie released, every time another survival game movies have released, people claim, Oh, it's a Battle Royale rip-off. That's blatant rip-off from Battle Royale. No, and no. They are not rip-off from Battle Royale. They are survival game genre movies and If you want to call them as rip-off, it goes way back. The earliest one I can think of is, The Most Dangerous Game (1932). There's also short story Arena by Fredric Brown in 1944 which was made into the episodes on both TV shows, The outer limits and Star Trek in mid 60s - well, actually Star Trek employed the similar scheme in more than one episode. The main plots are all the same they were all placed in a unknown ""arena"" unwillingly and they have to kill each other to survive. I'm not an expert of the movies and TV shows, so there probably are more movies or TV episodes employing the same survival game plot before Battle Royale.

Battle Royale is a bleeding heart critics worst nightmare, and a political leeches greatest lust since it would be nothing more than fodder for some jackass cause who cant get enough of bellyaching about current tragedies or issues. Takeshi Kitano turns in yet another brilliant performance as the vindictive former 7th grade teacher from hell, and unlike movies we have to endure here in the USA the Kids are all very good, and very believable (albeit in a semi tongue in cheek anime/manga/comic book way.) giving you the impression that they are scared s***less over the impending challenge. This is an absolute must for anyone who like films that are uncompromising, provoking & VIOLENT! Yes, this film has it all in spades, and it is done masterfully in a very comicbook way which some folks just don't quite get... but hey, most peoples idea of great films are usually marred by the current super PC, bland ideas that major studios are churning out left and right.

219,doodah367,A film challenging human mentality or just an no-brainer action movie?,8,11 December 2001,"Kinji Fukasaku is treading a very, very fine line with 'Battle Royale'.  It can be read as a masterpiece, challenging human mentality when placed in extreme conditions.  Or it can be read as a no-brainer action flick with duff social implications, no better than the action tripe which is pulled off the Hollywood production line.  The sense of comedy, which even moves into slapstick comedy in places, seems to pull the film into the latter category.Yet, I left the cinema thinking about what I'd do in the same situation. And I think that was what Fukasaku wanted to achieve with his work, he wanted his audience to leave questioning their own nature.The directors main mode of attack on the audience is the sight of young teenagers viciously murdering each other, and in some cases, the glee in which they take in it.  The sight of Kitano murdering a young girl for whispering before the game has even begun is very powerful, and would surely ridicule any notion that this is simply a no-brainer. 
I think the main flaw of the film is the quantity of characters are featured.  Instead of having 20 odd characters who the audience knows, and would therefore be more shocked at the deaths of, we are given 45 students, each who die in various 'sketches' showing the backgrounds preceding their arrival on the island.  Although some of these sketches are very powerful (the Lighthouse scene remains fresh in my memory), I believe that other ways could have been discovered to run the film's narrative.  This is probably what kept the film from being a masterpiece.I also believe that the English translation has done the original Japanese dialogue little justice.  In some places, the audience are suspicious of whether Fukasaku is trying to emulate the naivety of the characters in their speech, or whether the line has just been subtitled poorly.As it stands, 'Battle Royale' will become a cult classic.  It's notorious status, due to it's banned status in the U.S, will make it a must-see and I think audiences will find a lot here to make them think about.  The action just makes it a very powerful piece of work, used to hammer home the ideology.8/10",Battle Royale

221,kwongers,EXCELLENT  a mind-blowing exposition of teenage angst,10,19 July 2004,"This is, hands down, the BEST MOVIE COMING OUT OF JAPAN IN YEARS. As a reviewer who read the book first and loved it, I had high expectations for this movie and it did not let me down. Here's a quick plot summary: the Japanese government is in chaos. The adults are afraid the youth, who are apparently uncontrollable and boycott school. Therefore, the government institutes 'Battle Royale', a program designed to rein in the youth. A ninth-grade class is randomly selected each year, sent to a deserted island, supplied with weapons, and forced to kill each other until there is one survivor. I would have thought it difficult for a movie to track all 42 kids. In the book, this is fine since the book is 600+ pages. But this also works very well in the movie since the director somehow gives almost all the characters substantial screen time and v. memorable scenes. He doesn't cut any character short. And even the short scenes have real poignancy. Therefore, we remember almost all the characters, what they did, and how they died. THE ACTING IS SUPERB. The kids in this movie are played by actors between 15-20 years old. With the exception of one or two, the actors were v. believable and conveyed all the teenage angst, suspicion, hatred, rage, love, goodness, and all the other goodies in the book. Just to mention a few standouts: ERI ISHIKAWA (Yukie Utsumi) is the best actress, best-looking girl, and my favorite in this entire movie. She's perfect as the class representative who tries to calm everyone down but ends up feeling the same suspicion that is doing her classmates in. Her lighthouse scene is the most memorable scene in the film, and in my opinion, one of the best scenes in the history of cinema; just watch her faceaahhhh, that is perfect acting TAKESHI ""BEAT"" KITANO (Kitano) is the perfect combination of menace and sympathy as the teacher who sends the kids to their deaths and reads out the names of the dead with phrases like, 'Here is your list of goners! Only 3 dead. You're slacking off, I'm disappointed with you!' I love how emotions can flicker on and off his face; at one point, he can be scary and mean and terrible as hell; at other times, we feel sorry for him! TATSUYA FUJIWARA (Shuya Nanahara) and AKI MAEDA (Noriko Nakagawa) are fantastic as the couple we root for. Aki Maeda, especially, looks adorable in the movie and conveys innocence and purity so well. TARO YAMAMOTO (Shogo Kawada) is one of my fave characters in this movie and is the best bad-ass I've seen in movies for a while. He looks simultaneously tough and soft, which gives him an interesting complex. MASANOBU ANDO (Kazuo Kiriyama) and KOU SHIBASAKI (Mitsuko Souma) are deliciously wicked as the class's two crazy/wild ones, the two that are consciously going out to kill their classmates without remorse. And, on a vain note, SOUSUKE TAKAOKA, who plays the sweet and caring Hiroki Sugimura, is a major hottie. The DIALOGUE in this movie, like the book, is sometimes cringe-worthy (you know, like, 'Damn! I survived, thanks to my excellent bulletproof vest!!'). However, because it is usually delivered perfectly and on target, I hardly noticed it. (It may also be because the actors were speaking Japanese and I was only reading subtitles because I can't understand Japanese.) Although I did like the book better than the movie (tells you how good the book was since I think the movie is FANTASTIC), there are some moments in the movie that outshine even the book because of the acting and the way the dialogue is delivered. For example, Yukie's LIGHTHOUSE SCENE is much better in the movie than it is in the book. I love the way their voices become delirious and the way their anger escalates (it's nearly palpable!). Also, the setting is well-done, too. There are a lot of neutral and cool colors like whites, grays, and cool blues that set the mood and provide a contrast for all the bright red blood. That reminds me: this movie has, like the book, been criticized as VIOLENT EXPLOITATION. That is understandable since the movie shows young classmates killing each other in messy, realistic ways, some willfully and some out of fear. The movie is v. bloody and v. violent and sometimes gratuitous. I normally don't like violence, I don't like blood and guts and gore flying everywhere. I really hate those 'Halloween' and 'Freddy' and 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' type movies because blood spills needlessly and in an excessive/stupid way. But 'Battle Royale' is different. The violence will sometimes make your stomach turn, but you'll think, that's the only way it could have been done. And lastly, I have to praise the way CLASSICAL MUSIC is used in this movie. It's done in a v. artsy way that makes you think about the horrible things you've seen and make sense out of it, and I loved it. The use of Mozart and Giuseppe Verdi's 'DIES IRAE (REQUIEM MASS)' in the opening sequence is especially incredible. It practically lets you know that you're in for a wild, thought-provoking, horrific, unique, and exciting ride. Also, MASAMICHI AMANO (the composer) did a great job on the original music in 'Battle Royale.' I've listened to most of the soundtrack and think every one I've listened to has real poignancy and feeling. The way it is used in the film is even better; it brings even more meaning to what the kids are feeling and what they are doing. This is an INCREDIBLE movie - a mind-blowing exposition of the minds of teenagers and a fantastic exercise of style. I LOVED this movie. After watching it, you will be thinking about it for days; all the scenes of teenage angst will not leave your mind too easily. I give it my highest recommendation...go watch it right now!!",Battle Royale

Still there is some things that I might not get, because it's lost in translation and I am not that familiar with Japanese culture, yet this is definitely the best Japanese film I've ever seen.If you have seen The Hunger Games, but not this you should be ashamed, this is many times better than those and one of the reason The Hunger Games was made for the 'murican people.",Battle Royale
223,supergye,Battle Royale is not compelling to watch,3,30 November 2013,"This movie has all the violence one could hope for, but if your an actual adult, you will want more than that. The premise for the movie is weak. spoiler...The Japanese govt passes a BR (Battle Royale) law due to 15% unemployment, and distrust of the youth. This simply means they now have the right to force kids to kill each other. Not much of set up there. Forget the fact that Japan has been a Parliamentary Democracy since WW2. OK, if you accept this setup, then the story is basically 40 kids trying to kill each other. At least Hunger Games had a layer of political power aka Capitol. They were derived from winning a war following a near apocalyptic event. Thereby making demands on the losing side of people now held in poor Districts to hold a Hunger Games to remind them of the Capitol's control. The BR is extremely boring to watch in comparison since there are no common character(s) to root for. No real team or person to care about. Its just random kids getting violently killed. Somehow critics think this is exciting, and says something about how a metaphorical imperialistic Japanese govt treats the youth. This would be true if there was but a hint of any rebellion rather we see a disjointed effort to exercise different death counts. There is not one person that represents the govt of Japan. In fact the leader on the island is the class teacher ironically and he has little to say about politics.The acting is jarring as characters seem as if they need to shake excessively when they are excited, and overly calm when not. It reminds me of the acting in the old Godzilla movies. If you can make it thru the 114 min movie without falling asleep you should consider yourself lucky.",Battle Royale
224,kastenmeier-andreas,The Real Hunger Games,9,22 July 2017,"Do you like to see how the hunger games would really look and feel like, then watch the origin of the idea of young kids fighting to death while being watched on television. If you have problems with the basic concept of the movie, which simply is that a school class is sent to an island to kill each other off, then avoid this movie. If you're interested now than what are you waiting for? Some kids are persuaded by the price of life for the sole survivor and some try to form a union. One of the most interesting things to see in this movie are the different ways the kids cope with their situation. Also you never know which person might betray the other or who is having an advantage in a confrontation.Simply an interesting concept and watch. A Japanese classic from the early 2000's.",Battle Royale
225,arabesuku,And I thought the teens of 'All About Lily Chou-Chou' were messed up!,10,14 October 2006,"When I saw 'All About Lily Chou-Chou' (aka 'Riri ShuShu No Subete', by Shunji Iwai, 2001), I thought this was as messed up as teens could get in these movies.However, after seeing 'Battle Royale' (aka 'Batoru Rowaiaru'), I realised I was clearly wrong in my presumption.I am not going to spoil it for those who have not seen this movie yet, but all I will say is that 'Battle Royale' is dark, gory and sinister. This movie has a constant love/hate, trust/mistrust relationship about the teenagers and a dark ending around every corner.The acting is absolutely outstanding and the film itself stunning.A must-see, but definitely NOT for the faint at heart.",Battle Royale
226,Iguanatic,One of the best movies ever made...,10,16 September 2003,"Sci-fi opus from cult director Kinji Fukasaku which sees the Japanese Government launch an extreme counter measure against unruly teenagers who have the entire country living in fear. The Battle Royale Act, led by a former schoolteacher, dictates that one class of high school kids be chosen at random and taken to a deserted island where they will forced to kill each other off until only one remains - he/she being allowed to return home as the ultimate proof of how far the lawmakers are willing to go to curb the tide of juvenile disobedience.BATTLE ROYALE's a movie I'm relieved I didn't let slip by unnoticed. It's not the sort of film I usually go for, either, but my love of other Asian gems like RINGU and THE EYE compelled me to see whatever else Far Eastern filmmakers had to offer and this came highly recommended from many sources.
It's essentially a tale of survival and focuses primarily on two close friends - Nanahara and Noriko - who initially refuse point blank to harm their classmates before coming to the horrifying realisation that they have little choice. It's interesting for a movie with such a high bodycount to spend time developing the characters but we do get to know all the main protagonists and the at-times heartbreaking choices they have to make in order to survive. Not all the children have the same feelings, though - some of the bullied and more unpopular kids relish the chance of being allowed to take their tormentors lives legally - and it's fun to see such drastic transformations in a few of the characters from virginal 16 year olds to cold blooded killers.Violence can never be applauded - and if the British Government ever tried a similar thing I'd imagine there'd be a few complaints! - but director Kinji Fukasaku handles proceedings with a steady hand and resists the temptation to turn this into an excessive bloodbath. The atrocities of the battle are counted with some snappy one-liners and flashbacks to happier times.Movies don't earn cult followings for no reason and BATTLE ROYALE certainly justifies its enormous worldwide following. It's refreshing, it's highly entertaining and I loved every minute. Highly recommended!  ***** / *****",Battle Royale
227,Manji,SiMpLy DeLiCiOuS,10,16 July 2001,"It's been a while since I saw a film that hit me so deep. So long, in fact, that I can't even remember a movie that hit me like Battle Royale. For almost eight months, I was genuinely over-hyped on this fantastic film. I patiently waited for my opportunity to witness this film. Only a few weeks ago, the anticipation was quelled with the acquirement of the juice!I've heard alot of negative reviews about the film, mainly because of the ""exploitive violence"". But another dislike of the film, stems from the melodramatic attitudes and deaths of certain characters in the film. Many of the critics who are up in arms against the portrayal of the children in the film shouldn't be so critical. They haven't recently been around the young students of today. They are living with an outdated concept of how a teenager is supposed to act. In this day and age, teens are anything but typical and often have much difficulty concealing their emotions in school let alone an island where they have to kill eachother.The characters were right on, the actors did a fantastic job. And of course the directing was ultra-incredible! The less you hear about this movie, the better you are. It's horrific, it's real, it's a scary reality.",Battle Royale
228,Manji,It's been two years since I saw this flick. What do I think?,10,15 January 2003,"Kinji Fukasaku made a film called Battle Royale back in 2000. He's made plenty of films in the past. I've seen very few of them, apart from Battle Royale but I'm always searching for more.Battle Royale is a film that has affected many, many people. There are rabid fans of Battle Royale and there are even more people that hate it. Let me tell you why. Battle Royale is a film that exercises its right to explore an idea. Many films have great ideas but most are poorly realized. Battle Royale is simply an awesome movie about one of the most hypothetically traumatic things that could ever happen to teenagers. For those that don't know, the film focuses on what happens when a group of high school students are sent to an abandoned island to kill each other. What brings such a bizarre idea to fruition includes civil unrest, teenage anxiety, and a nation literally terrorized by their youth. It's set in Japan and though it is just a movie it still hit pretty close to reality due to current problems with Japanese youth. In fact, the film was poorly received by the government who feared that the release of the film would incite riots and other such acts of mayhem by the same youth which it focused on. The problem is the same the world around. Young people are much more volatile than they ever were say 20-30 years ago and Battle Royale captures the essence of the horror that today's youth would face going into such a circumstance. Friends kill other friends and bullies all to survive. At the same time they get to live out those videogames that they loved to play at home.
[SIDE NOTE: Counter-Strike, a Half-Life (popular videogame) mod for example, easily prepares young people for the reality of weapons. How many bullets are in a clip of an MP5? What does an assault rifle sound like? Questions like these are easily answered by the videogames of today. Sure, these weapons are also on the streets and in some parts of the world they are even in the hands of children as young as five years-old but the videogame set up creates a comfortable experience with such weapons. It's not that videogames necessarily make people want to get guns rather it gives familiarity to guns. I should mention that I love to play Counter-Strike myself and will continue to play it in the future. I don't hate the game, I'm just pointing out that it does present a fairly realistic portrayal of weapons.]
The problem is that there can be only one survivor of this island massacre, this only adds extra pressure to the already unprepared children who have to fight for their lives. What is truly shocking is that the actors and actresses who have been selected to portray these teens are around the same ages of their characters. They aren't the aging 20-30 somethings that just happen to look young; they are literally teenagers. This flick has some serious bite! It's such a great comment on how we are living in the 21st century in a time when frequently the fear for a country comes from within rather than outside forces.Certainly, terrorism is at the forefront of the average North American's mind due to the World Trade Center attacks and CNN's endless coverage of the horrors of said event have easily made the problem an international event. But before that the biggest headline grabbers focused on young people, filled with `rage', unleashing their anger on their helpless peers using an array of weapons (mainly guns). School shootings shocked the world when children started killing their peers.Battle Royale is not meant to trivialize school shootings and youth violence. Rather, it's an examination of the lengths which a government will go in order to discipline the youth. It's such a ludicrous idea. But the characters stay true to form as they profess long held crushes with their dying breath all the way down to naively trusting others who they've always admired as the popular kids. It's sick. Strange. Beautiful. Familiar. Different. And completely engaging. Most people are against the film because they feel that the plot is simply silly or because the dialogue is too hammy or some such nonsense. At the same time, those naysayers will praise films like Braveheart for its honest portrayal of Scotland's only historical hero. I loved Braveheart. I thought it was great too but it's bogus, for the most part. Certain battles and events really did happen. But William Wallace was no man to look up to. He raped and killed women and small children but none of that made it into the film because it was not that kind of ""feel good"" thing that would sell Wallace as a hero. Battle Royale, since it draws on fictitious characters and plot is far more interesting because it really makes you think about your own life. Could you kill your best friend from high school if the two of you are stuck on an island of death? To this day I refuse to answer that question. It sickens me to think of such a thing and so I felt disturbed by what those 42 kids had to do in Battle Royale. What's even worse is that they were picked by lottery to end up on the island. In the Japan that exists in Battle Royale, each year a random high school class is picked for the event. We are led to believe that all youth in Japan are bad seeds in this film but that really doesn't seem to apply to the class which the film follows. For all intents and purposes, they were innocent. The dialogue between characters is poignant, real, and totally innocent. You can literally see how limited their vocabulary and understanding of the world around them is. Furthermore, as I mentioned earlier, some of the characters even profess love for their classmates without even knowing what love is all about. High school is a weird time for anybody. It's an awkward time that is all about experience and misunderstandings. So many people AFTER high school really learn the truth about who liked them and what people really thought of them. During high school there's always some social wall that stops any REAL open communication between two people. Being on the island forces unchecked emotions and feelings to flow out of the characters because death is on the horizon. Can you really label the dialogue as lousy in those circumstances?Obviously, there are intelligent and well-organized people in the world. Some exist in high school but for the most part teenagers are brash, foolish, and irresponsibly reckless because they've yet to learn from experience. They rarely have any experience. Teenagers put on an island to kill themselves will certainly not learn anything new and if they do it won't matter considering that they'll soon be dead.Naturally, some go insane and mutter those math equations that their teachers promised them would be valuable in the real world. Others feel the need to fulfill their sexual desires, who wants to die as a virgin, right? Still others try to make the best of the situation by spending their last few hours alive as civilized as possible. But the purpose of the game affects all of these teenagers. They have to hurry. If the battle isn't finished in 3 days they all must die which is easy for the people in charge who have low-jacked each teenager with collars that explode. Not enough to take the head clean off, by default, but rather just enough of an explosion to open up the jugular. They bleed out until they die.their hopes and dreams for the future go with them. This is a grisly film that doesn't specifically cater to gore hounds. Certainly there are some really disturbing death scenes and moments but nothing TOO over the top. The idea is shocking enough, there's no need to be excessive. At first this fact upset me. I wanted this film to be a bloody parade of carnage because I reasoned that it's just a movie. Just some form of entertainment that existed to please me. But the whole idea is sickening and compelling enough to satisfy on more layers than just the visual.In the end, this is not a film for just anyone off the street. There are so many sceptics and people who are unable to maturely grasp the concept of the film. These are the people that really hate it and you can't really blame them. For too long, Hollywood has been the dominant authority on filmmaking in the world. What was once a greatly expressive and thought-provoking medium has now simply become a trite and boring thing. Everything is recycled over and over. It's repackaged, re-sold, re-distributed to the point that people can hardly accept something new and radical and different. If it's not safe, generic, or commercial than the reason for a film's existence appears to be highly questionable. Battle Royale isn't going to change the world. I wish it could but the damage has already been done and now there is no place for a film that challenges socio-political norms or has subtitles. But that's alright. Films that matter are still being made even if they don't get the same amount of press or attention that the next Leonardo DiCaprio movie will get. If you enjoy Battle Royale then Kinji Fukasaku, who directed and adapted the film for the screen along with his son Kenta, will be able to rest in peace. The man died on January 12th, 2003. He was 72 years-old and all he wanted to do was make movies until he died. He got his wish.

229,The3Extremes,"A terrific, brutal action film!",10,8 October 2005,"This movie has to be seen to be believed! It is an action film but seems to have an element of atmosphere that is unmatchable even by hardcore horror films! The film's music is really melodramatic and morbid and is played at just the right times. The level of violence in this movie is absurd, and boy#6 (kiriyama) is superb as the lunatic-joker-of-the-pack killing anyone he sees without mercy or remorse. The film's plot is a very controversial subject, the kids in Japan are out of control, they bunk classes, physically assault teachers and just do as they please. Time for that to change thanks to 'Battle Royale', the new reality t.v. show(like supernanny but with older kids and sadistic violence).Unruly kids made to fight on a deserted island until there is one student left, all the rest must be dead.With a necklace round their neck that tracks the kids and is also a bomb, if they attempt to leave the island, it simply explodes, in 3 days time, if there is no winner, it explodes, if they take it off it explodes. Each kid given a different weapon(lucky ones get grenades, unlucky ones get dustbin lids!)The ending is a big let down as it is a muddle that doesn't make much sense. Overall, a brilliant must-see for ultra-violence lovers like me. 10 out of 10",Battle Royale
230,tcdarkness,"""Bloody"" good, but...",7,22 July 2004,"After reading most of the manga adaptation before viewing this, the pacing of the movie left something to be desired.  Two hours is long for some movies, but not this one.  I think it easily should have run at least another half an hour.  There are 42 (more or less) characters to kill off and most o their backstories are not even touched.  But for those that do, they did a good job.Besides that somewhat irking flaw, the acting, direction, etc. were all good in this, even if you need subtitles to understand Japanese.  Most of the differences between the film and written formats of the film are fine except for the humanization of the teacher.  It didn't seem like that kept it true to the theme of the original story.The blood and guts flying, well, that is superb.  7/10",Battle Royale
231,manalone923,"Way more serious, dramatic, and emotional than I ever expected. The most mature handling of the subject that I can imagine.",10,8 February 2005,"To begin with, yes, I rented this video because I'd heard that it was a very controversial film- a bloody tale in which a class of high school kids are forced to play cat and mouse and kill each other until only one remains.And yes, I received that. But I was completely shocked that I also got a very serious, character-driven, emotional drama. If you're into this movie because of the violence, don't worry, you'll be happy. But for those quick to turn away because they think this will be another crazy, senseless, far-out Japanese trash film? I have to tell you- you're very wrong. I went into this film wanting to see just how flashy and violent it would be, and walked away from it with a much higher opinion. This movie didn't insult my intelligence with two hours of nonsense. Instead, it captivated me with emotional tales of life, loss, love, and friendship. These kids aren't just disposable fodder. The movie makes sure we understand that they all had lives and dreams.The film's premise is explained quickly but paced expertly: In a future Asia, things are horrible and some adults have rebelled against the youth that spites them. One man in particular, a high school teacher, goes with his unruly class on a field trip. They're shocked to find themselves being hustled into a room under supervision of armed militants and told that their lives are at an end. Each of the 40 kids are given a bag of rations and a random weapon, and shoved out onto an isolated island where they must kill each other, or be killed themselves.As strange as this may sound, I was surprised at how well these scenes played out. These kids are fine actors. Extreme disbelief, shock, rage, confusion, terror- it's all on their faces as they slowly take this message in. Some rebel and are quickly disposed of. Others fly into rage at what they see. Most others however shrink into the corners of the small room and try their best to accept the impossible fate before them. Soon though, the music goes low and the faces get stark as the kids are rushed, one by one, out into the wilderness. They look at their friends and hastily embrace for what they know will probably be the last time.As I said, there is of course a lot of violence in the film. It's comparable to the first Kill Bill, or perhaps the original Robocop. But the controversy following this film is due simply to its theme of high schoolers killing high schoolers, and also due to the film's dark tone. I reiterate: This isn't a rocking, stylistic gun glamorization. Some of these kids fall backwards in fear, not wanting to fire upon their friends. Others recoil in shock when they do what's required. Others simply attempt suicide to free themselves of the burden. The subject of this movie is not taken lightly. The mood is dark, the situation desperate.Driving things home are vignettes of the kids. Often, we're given glimpses of these people's lives. We see exuberance of youth- a shy boy trying to find a way to let a girl know he likes her. A girl who's happy to bring cookies to her friends for the field trip. Another boy who just lost his father and is trying to cope. The basketball game where these kids last shared their lives together. This film is about loss, primarily evidenced by the loss of innocence and youth that these kids experience when they know they have to kill their best friends. Heightening the film is a gorgeous, poetic soundtrack of classical music that is expertly juxtaposed against the agony and misery that these people have to go through.The film makes sense, has a well-paced, intelligent narrative, and interesting circumstances. Some kids can't handle what's happening, others glory in it. Some are experts, some are terrified. Something important is constantly going on, and by the end, it's a sad, moving piece of human drama regardless of who wins- if anyone. Well acted, well scored, with raw and realistic dialog, and fantastic direction. Yes, if you strip away all narrative, this is a movie about kids killing each other. But to my pleasant shock, it was also one of the most moving, emotional dramas about life and loss that I've ever seen. And not just life, but what it means to live.",Battle Royale
232,Chris_Silver,SilverRating,6,9 April 2014,"Battle Royale (バトル・ロワイアル)-Japan 2000Battle Royale... Is this where Suzanne Collins got the idea of Hunger Games?This movie, is just, great but abrupt. This movie could've been so much longer than it is. I usually say ""Movies progress to slowly,"" but this movie, could've been made so much longer. It's just so short! The story is great. But just how it progresses abruptly, it starts abruptly.The film is great due to it's lack of character development. That stood out to me like a soar thumb, you don't even make any connections with the characters. You look at all of these people, the 40-something kids of Class B and you are told nothing about them, then the plot begins. The only subtle hints you get at the story are those that are stated by the characters. Adding to that, the beauty of the lack of character development in the beginning is all of these kids, each has a different story, but we aren't told ANY of their stories till just before the plot begins. These kids could be anyone, just like the ingredients in your kitchen, they are completely 100% themselves. But these kids are like ingredients, thrown into a cauldron and stirred. Blank ingredients, with no name. Just as the kids have are anonymous at first (to us,... I mean they have names but we know nothing of them). We begin getting to know the characters, as they are killers or victims, not the normal Asian kids they are.This movie is one, one great trademark of Asian teenage-ism. I presume just as ""The Hunger Games"" is an attraction for teen movie goers, this movie Battle Royale is an attraction for the Japanese teenage movie goers. And I can tell why. The production is sub-par, fantastically cliché and just great. The production efforts were alright, some plot holes, but other than that, the bad production and such only amplify the great great GREAT cliché-ness of the movie. Especially the ending, which I can't comment on, because I am not a spoiler. But these are some great teen movie angles. The movie takes some well needed twists and turn but when it comes back on track everything makes sense. I am actually beginning to hate IMDb's online pictures of this movie because just the pictures give away the plot. Love it, or at least the concept, but not a favorite. I really want to give it more than a 7/10 but, nope. SilverRating: 7/10 but 4.5 stars and Two Thumbs Up for ultra cool idea and originality.",Battle Royale
233,Alenbalz,total rubbish,1,4 May 2014,"40 odd students forced to kill each other, or else, they die anyway, A stupid story, with lousy acting, and unbelievably poor special effects. Amazes me how anyone could rate this more than 1. They are supposed to be 9th graders, that's about 15 yrs olds: instead they all looked more like they were 18-23 year olds. As an aside distraction/story-line, almost all of the students had a secret crush on somebody that was invariably revealed just before they were killed, often by the object of their admiration. 42 characters are just too many to deal with in any real depth in this 2hrs slow paced movie, so they are dropped off like unknown flies with no real character development; and of course it makes for boringly repetitive death scenes. 13 yrs later the Hollywood copy 'the Hunger Games' wasn't any better.

Battle Royale: A game to eliminate almost 40 disturbing students(leaving only one as the survivor). They are drugged, dropped off on an island, given a explosive collar around their neck(like in ""Wedlock""), are shown an instruction video(how to play BR) and given a bag with a map and a weapon. The weird thing is that their teacher(played by famous Takeshi Kitano) is the leader of the game.Two of the students are Shuya and Noriko. Shya is an orphan, since his looser father hanged himself and Noriko is the most bullied girl in the class (they call her ""tiny ugly shrimp!"").Together they and the ""veteran"" fight on the island. Every day their teacher tells them who died and where they should not be(they add danger zones to the map which triggers the collar if someone is in them).Of course this movie has some bad guys too. Mitsuko is the meanest of them all. She is a sneaky, evil coldblooded murderer. Their Teacher, has his own obedient child who hates him (which makes him hate his students even more). He kills the kids who refuse to play BR.This movie has it all. Explosions, poison, shootouts, neck-shots, cruel executions, groin-stabbings, stunguns, decapitations, lovestory etc...It's one of the best movies I've ever seen.

Well thats what the kids int this film are told and its rather scary how suddenly some of them can turn on their friends but when it comes to survival i suppose we would all kill..wouldn't we? This is a foreign masterpiece that has no equal. Not only is the story absolutely out of control and completely crazy it is also really compelling and mind boggling. I can guarantee you will be thinking about your own lives and friends and wondering what you'd would do if you had to kill one of them to save yourself after watching this film.But don't get me wrong i think this film is absolutely brilliant and deserves all of the credit it deserves, anyone not sure whether they want to sit through two hours of sub titles then take my advice and do.

237,VincentBauer,"A Movie about Trust, Betrayal, Friendship, and Violence",10,4 February 2007,"Like most people my age, I have grown up with the Asian Cinema. I've always liked how they have had something that American Movies didn't. This movie that I just watched a couple of minutes ago has all the elements of a great film.Somewhere in the new future, 15% of the population is unemployed and students begin to boycott and not go to school. For all of this an act has been passed known as the BR Act (battle royale act) in which each year 42 students are chosen from one class to fight on an island. They have no choice but to fight and kill the other students. Their friends. If they try and run away their collar that has been placed on their neck will explode. While all of this is told to the students, two of them resist and are killed in front of the entire group showing them that they mean business. Along with the students are two ""transfer"" students. One who is the survivor of a previous BR, the other there just to have fun. The students are told that the collar on their neck also reveals their pulse and location on the island which allows the people running the whole show to know who and when is dead. To prevent someone from staying in the same place the whole time, there are danger zones in which if one happens to be in that zone, their collar explodes. Each person is given food and water, and a weapon. However not every weapon received can be deadly, but all is of use.From there the students leave and immediately fighting starts. Some wish not to fight while others kill only to get out alive. In this process, many of them run into each other where they'll try to use their friendship to get out of the situation alive. Some couples, admit their love to one another before dying. This is the emotional part of it. There are also others who kill just for the heck of it. Some people team up which then fails and others commit suicide. Only one will come out alive.This movie was well written and directed. I felt that it showed how friendships and love can end if their own life is at stake. It is also a movie that if remade, could cause some controversy, yet it is a great movie nonetheless.Battle Royale 10/10",Battle Royale
238,ravenwood80,Asian excellence??,8,12 August 2005,"For starters Battle royale is different, and original. I have never seen a film which pits teenagers against each other to the death, with extreme brutality. I personally like the idea and the premise. The island in which the film is based is also a good location and looks menacing in its own right. the things that let the film down though stop it from being a personal favourite and classic are for one, the script itself, conversation wise, is poor. Everybody is in love with each other, and people kill themselves before even attempting to survive. If it was my old class from school ages ago we all would of tried to kill one another no doubt about it. Another thing, the acting, it is awful, and you don't care who dies and who doesn't, you know for sure 5 mins into the film that nanahara will survive. The girl out of kill bill is gorgeous, as is the girl from the video. I did enjoy the movie though, but can't help but think that if the Americans remade this with the cream of young talent and a director of David Finchers calibre it would not only be an improvement but maybe push the premise into that cult status.",Battle Royale

The story of BR is about 42 students trapped inside an island in 3 days and force to kill each other until only one survives. Shocking isn't it? Well, it certainly is. The storyline is very interesting, classic and easy to follow. The acting is also superb, the main casts and great, and the supporting cast was good. The violence, which was one of the main themes of the movie, was pretty ""hard to swallow"". It's obviously hard to swallow cause I can't take a look on uniformed cute girls and guys killing each other, but in the end I realize that the whole movie is brutally beautiful.Battle Royale is an Asian classic, a classic that was made by the late Kinji Fukasaku.

The story centre's around an island, where a school class are kidnapped and sent too, their they are each given a weapon and supplies with the sole instruction to KILL THEIR CLASS MATES in order to be released in 3 days time, if they refuse to participate they will be KILLED, if more then one classmate survives after 3 days they will be all KILLED, if they walk into any ""danger"" area within the island they will be KILLED, a hell of a lot of killing mixed in with explosive collars, knifes, guns, bombs, bows & arrows you name it this film has got it in abundance As a fan of the comics as well as the books I have to say the film lived up to all my expectations and then some. The central character Shuya Nanahara is developed slowly but surely throughout the film, and his plight and struggle with the ""BR Act"" is extraordinary told. The viewer can never know who is going to be killed or who is going to survive something to Kinji Fukasaku's credit. Kitano ""Beat"" Takashi plays a crazed teacher with finesse, and the movie goes through to explain why the government has been forced to pass the Battle Royale Act, due to out of control teenagers, supposedly in the not too distant future.........sounds a bit surreal! While your girlfriend/mum/sister/friend may be put of from the sound of the brutal non-stop violence I swear that this film only carries out violence for the sake of graphical entertainment, and the shock horror of it all is to get your emotions all out of shape and take you on a journey with the class, through the island to see just one stand & survive and be allowed to walk away free Who will it be?",Battle Royale

242,ThEAnOrExOrCiSt,"Do What Must Be Done, Lord Vader",9,6 September 2006,"Wow, what a flick. Watched it with some college buds and the missus. Talk about psychologically intense. Kudos for the makers of this film, as they explore the quick deterioration of superficial high school relationships when it comes down to who is going to die. We coldn't help but talk about what kind of strategies we'd have deployed had we been forced into similar situations. We agreed the best strategy (since we all hated high school and the majority of our classmates treated us badly) would have been to pick people off as they exited the encampment, take good weapons, find a high vantage point, and pick off any and everyone who came past, marking a point to go ""hunting"" at night, when the fools would be sleeping. Regardless, the movie makes several points, including the exposure of true friendships vs. phonies, and it was quite entertaining. The thing with the teacher, I didn't get, though. What was up with the cell phone, eh? Also, the flashbacks didn't really add much to the story. Someone should remake this in America without sappy-ing up the story or turning it into a gorefest. A true ""survivor"" game.",Battle Royale

244,johnnycage10,great movie,9,24 February 2005,"This is a great film throughout. But regardless, I'll try to include things that other viewers didn't include in their praises, at least as far as I can tell. The plot's surprising, as I didn't know what it involved when I watched it with the person who bought the film. It did remind me of another film, Tokyo 11, which had the same style and especially the same instructions on how to play the game given on tape by the same kind of overly cheerful adolescent girl. But unlike Tokyo 11, the story here is also scary, as the characters are placed on an island to kill each other, and aren't running around society overall (where you could obviously call the Police or loved ones for help if you found yourself in that situation). But this is also scary because it's believable. No supernatural monsters with razor-sharp teeth or multiple limbs (not that there's anything wrong with that), but humans being a danger to each other. The one student who woke up in the bus and saw the rest of his classmates to be out cold, only to see a teacher dressed in a gas mask who hit him over the head must've seen the stuff that nightmares are made of. ******SPOILERS******* The characters were interesting, starting with the villain of a head teacher (Kitano), who was bogged down with domestic issues at home. Even if his death was a bit too comical, no doubt that he gave the movie's best and most serious performance, and that's not surprising considering the actor is a veteran while everyone else in the cast is literally a kid. Shuya and Noriko were cookie-cutter nice (if not too memorable) kids, so it was bearable to see the majority of the events through their eyes. Kawada was better and more memorable as the loner tough guy who protected them regardless of his desire to be alone (reminded me of a teenaged Dirty Harry, from the first DH film, not the lousy sequels), as there was no way that Shuya/Noriko would've survived without his support. Such a shame he died of his injuries at the end. I would've loved to see him in the sequel. In addition, it was cool how the movie gave the two villain students a touch of sympathy, like the end statement that Misuko got to utter upon her death, which made her not be so hated. And psychotic Kirayama (signed up for fun!!) crying blood before he died himself, almost as if he was being driven to kill by mental demons and didn't like being so bloodthirsty, and was thus crying over this force that had such a terrible hold over him. The smaller characters also made an impression, especially the group of students who were organized together to avoid killing others, and armed to the teeth since they pooled their weapons, which Kirayama wiped out by stealing their most advanced firearm. That group left a mark since its members achieved a sense of discipline and trust very quickly, getting together to serve a goal of safety and non-aggression. It's too bad we didn't see what their long-term plans would've been after the 3 days were finished  would they have attacked the military stronghold where their former teacher and soldiers were located in an effort to get rid of their collars? But we didn't find out since Kirayama crashed their figurative party by pretending to be harmless and/or lost, armed only with a fan, even though the group did seem ready to accept him into their ranks, though first acting in a condescending fashion for a little while. The second set of small characters were the two girls who were trying to spread a message of peace, and were rewarded with getting shot repeatedly for their effort, in a show of violence via the use of a loudspeaker that was about as dark as it gets. So there's a lesson in both those cases  it's great to be idealistic and brave, but never let your guard down while extending an olive branch since the act of being nice can get you hurt if you're not wary of people who'll take advantage of your generosity. Overall, great, great movie - 9/10. Ideally, it'd be ace if Hollywood could make a GOOD version of this film, with actors that Western audiences can recognize. But realistically, any remake from Hollywood would be bogged down with gravity-defying invisible wire stuntwork (good in controlled doses, but gets annoying when everyone can fly) and of course annoying sex scenes. So to play it safe, I hope the Hollywood that is 95% garbage and 5% quality stays away from this unique story.",Battle Royale
245,nbutcher-69458,Only the intelligent viewer may grasp it's subtle themes,9,6 March 2018,"It's easy to dismiss this film as some kind of glorified school student snuff film, but look under the surface and the movie is rich in it's themes.Much like ""Lord of the Flies"", Battle Royale is a coming of age film where the veneer of civilized society is brushed away to reveal the dark heart of human nature. Where it differs is that the school students are taken away from the comfort and protection of their school and thrown by their adult teachers into a last-man-standing fight to the death. This premise sets a symbolic metaphor for Battle Royale as the students' adult life - beyond the safety, protection and confines of school, and into the no-holds-barred world of adults.Without giving too much away, thematically Battle Royale covers the many ways in which the students attempt to deal with the stark reality of life - where friendships and trusts have been erased away, and where it is easier to kill and steal to get ahead than it is to work together against all odds.
Yet predictably, and without spoiling too much, it is only through pure love for others that the remaining students manage to survive against all the other ones who have lost their soul.It's probably hard for western audiences to grasp the film, but seen in the native country and in the native language it is a powerful film. Japanese society is highly civilized and exceedingly polite. The idea of schoolchildren killing each other is about as polar opposite that Japanese culture can go.",Battle Royale
246,*(CableGuy)*,A flawed but very brave work,8,22 August 2001,"Having gone all to the trouble of finding an import VCD of this flick, I'm glad I put in all the effort.  The younger and elder Fukusakus both exhibit pretty big stones producing a work like this, one which could never be duplicated in the states.  Even though such a brutal situation would be far more likely in the US, recent escalating school violence would prevent such a film from ever being made stateside.  Some teenage sappiness does seep in, and the motivations for some of the characters, particularly Sickle Girl and the red-haired boy ""there just for fun,"" are shallow or dubious.  Also, the media could have been used for greater effect, adding more absurdity by spinning the contest as some kind of reality TV event.  The movie keeps a ""score"" of sorts, but imagine slick graphics portraying the killrates and deaths, with a play-by-play from the same adorable gal who gave the students their instructions.  Knowing how hard Japanese students are worked, I can see the motivations behind portraying such a draconian test of worth of mere schoolkids, absurd as it may be.  Still, even if you can't relate the cultural background of this film, you can't help but wonder just what you'd do in the place of one of these frightened students.",Battle Royale
247,silentmallrat,Best of the Best. That ain't no lie,10,24 July 2001,"When i first heard about Battle Royal, i was facinated by the concept;  42 kids on an island having to kill each other in order to go home.  Though the movie is some what violent (ie, necks being blown out, guy getting stabed in a place that all men cherish, ect) it's not focused on the violence like many american and eruopean horror and trash flicks are.  Insted the violence is very real.  They show things that really can happen.  If you have a bomb around your neck, and it explodes, it's going to do some damage there. The violence in this film strengthens it.  The actions are real.  Think to your self, if you were a teenager thrown into a situation were you were forced to kill your friends for 1) The prize of returning home, 2) saving your own life, 3) Punishment for a over conservitive goverment who is trying to teach kids a lesson in behavior, what would you do?

249,bibleboyiam,Incredible..........Disappointment (**Warning** This Film is Not for Fans of the Manga) ***SPOILERS***,4,10 September 2004,"Let me start by stating that I absolutely love Battle Royale, not the movie, but the characters, universe, and events that occur therein. Let me also note that I had very high expectations going into the film due to the fact that I had read the novel and the manga (both of which are excellent; the manga more so) prior to viewing the film. These unrealistically high expectations have lead me to label the film a disaster, yet if a potential viewer has no prior knowledge of the manga or novel, the movie will seem much better solely for the uniqueness of the plot. Yet if a viewer were to look at the details concerning the quality of the movie overall, he would likely agree with me in that the film in fact IS a disaster. The casting, acting, intentional melodrama, editing, and even the gory effects (which consist of nothing more than spurting, splatting, and spraying blood: no frayed flesh, intestines, or brain matter, all of which would realistically be visible in the event of such violent deaths(the manga does not disappoint in this area)) are all low grade compared to that of the typical modern Hollywood film. In addition, considering that there were 42 kids to kill off in a 90 minute time frame, no time was spared for character development or background; in fact, the film merely IMPLIED several of the most interesting death sequences!!! The manga portrays every death in grim detail as well as leaving no back story uncovered (there is no way that a fan of the manga or novel could enjoy this version!). Furthermore, the most interesting factors included in the manga and novel e.g. Kiriyama's terminator-like determination and godlike physical abilities (in the movie he was clumsy at best and resembled a petty 15 year old playing a video game), Mitsuko's succubus-like sex appeal (here she was played by a rather average looking no-name teen actress), Shogo's mature buff/chiseled look and uncanny knack for survival (here played by a scrawny nobody with the ability to roll around on the ground like a lobotomized puppy yet somehow avoided being shot to pieces at point blank with an Uzi), Hiroki's inhuman agility and mastery of Kung Fu (in the movie he fell over and died like a three legged dog), and finally Shinji's amazing athletic abilities (here he does a somersault....... into...... a blaze......... of bullets.....and dies). I do realize that the movie was created before the manga, but like I said before, this is what I was thinking after familiarizing myself with the manga. Now I have read several reviews that note the inability of Americans to understand the essence of Japanese culture; this in regards to the seemingly ridiculously unrealistic plot, and I find it interesting that many non-Americans underestimate the intelligence of many Americans in assuming that we cannot see past our own noses. The idea that the Japanese idolize youth is apparent in all manga and anime, this is not a difficult concept to grasp, yet even with the knowledge and understanding of this cultural norm in Japan, this movie sucks. Understanding does not always yield acceptance. Hell, as stated before, I love the plot, the execution was just far below par. 4/10 (If you liked the movie GO GET THE MANGA)",Battle Royale

254,Reiko_95,man's true nature and the extent of his capabilities FLAWLESSLY REVEALED !,10,14 June 2008,"Among other things, if this were to be for real, GOD HAVE MERCY ON US ALL !! for we would truly be worthy of extinction and the only way for mankind to realise just how fierce, evil and sadistic it has become would be to have it taught a lesson far more cruel than what anyone of us is capable of. this movie shows the evil nature the animal instinct that lies within everyone of us just waiting for the right ""opportunity"" to surface, at times hybernating at other times unleashed and this movie proves the latter in a unique way that brings out the darkness inside the human mind. how can adults take revenge on children just because they were, shall we say, out of line ? no matter how bad juveniles can be, nothing justifies what happens here...NOTHING ! think about it...i don't know under what circumstances the parents of those students were notified...maybe they were notified or maybe they were ""notified"" but if they really were notified of what the sick meaning of the BR Act was, what parent in his right mind would willingly accept to have his child put to death in order to justify or willingly give into some adult sick minds' conception of the gravely misinterpreted and mocked in this case, Darwinian theory of the strong shall survive ? If this were to be for real, and thank God it isn't, but just supppose it were, i would be ashamed to call myself not only a parent but an adult as well. Darwin's theory is part of everyday life in one way or another, but to adapt it to such an evil, grotesque way is just too unnatural, too inhuman. even animals fight for survival but for a good cause: they hunt for food unlike man who fights for supremacy, territorial expansion, greed, or even sport. the feeling of greed and evil is absent from animals but sadly not from man, which is a shame because we can think and implicitly distinguish right from wrong far better than animals can not just by making use of our nature-blessed instincts but on a larger, more complex scale. it's a shame that we have become what this movie is outlining.... savages...killing each other for sport. you don't see animals screwing each other over for a goddamn percentage, unlike us. the message of the movie is really sad, and not only that but sounds the alarm on a possible future outbreak of one of man's darkest, yet ""unexplored"" side. shame on us as a human race for such atrocities now taken to the next level: willingly accepting the demise of OUR OWN FLESH AND BLOOD on a yearly basis! (is pretty obvious the parents of those students were notified, which makes it even more outrageous)which no longer involves grown-ups but even worst. As bad as it may seem on screen the movie is excellent and i mean one of a kind in depicting a possible subliminal message to all those who can ""dig"" it. The story is absolutely unique, original at its very core, something Hollywood could never muster due to a number of reasons some obvious some not. Highly recommended ! Also watch Battle Royale 2 as well even though i don't recommend it and you will see why in my comment regarding it! Peace and god helps us all !",Battle Royale
255,thediggens,"A gritty, dystopian slaughter-fest",8,10 July 2014,"A blockbuster in Japan and a cult classic in the rest of the world ever since, Battle Royale is a dark, brutal satire bathed in high-concept excess. A class of 42 school-children left on an island with 3 days to kill each other explores relationships, competition and morality.The film is directed by Kenji Fukasaku, who bravely casts teenagers of the same age (15) to play the violent roles, all of whom do incredibly well at breathing life into the mostly two-dimensional roles given to them. Unlike other, similar films, the school children's' past is always at the forefront, affecting their decisions and actions (references abound to school cliques, past relationships and transgressions). Thrown into the scenario suddenly, the seriousness of the situation doesn't change how they perceive and interact with each other. They all do a marvelous job, which helps mitigate characters blending in to one another.The violence the characters face is never shied away from; rather, it is extreme and excessive. This does not mean the film itself is overly serious or straight-faced. Indeed, it is precisely this somewhat over the top display that makes the film perversely and darkly comedic. This succeeds in keeping the film from becoming depressing, deftly mixing in absurdity and playfulness (see the instruction video at the beginning).The music ranges from appropriate to melodramatic, but the cinematography does a much better job at conveying the attitude. It's a very dark palate, sometimes too drab, but is nicely intermingled with contrasting shots, such as the lighthouse. But the film is at its most successful in claustrophobic night settings, where the tension ratchets up and the characters thrive.The narrative follows Shuya and Noriko, the former being the most developed character in the film and certainly the protagonist. Regrettably, in a film with numerous strong and diverse female characters, Noriko never develops significantly being object of desire, and occasionally damsel. They later team up with Kawada, another well-developed male, and one of the most likable characters. Other characters come and go, some faring better than others from this tight adaption of a somewhat obtuse book. Kiriyami and Mitsuko, the two 'antagonists' of the film have less developed back-stories than their novel counterparts, but that may be a blessing as they were absurd and over-the-top, respectively. The antagonists perform well, as do others who interact. The pettiness of teenagers is highlighted with the group of girls at the lighthouse.Yet others fall flat. Hacker Shinji and his group unsuccessfully try and straddle the line between important and irrelevant, and some characters are never given a chance to break out of thin caricatures- the 'fat kid' and the formula-spouting 'nerd kid' come to mind. This, and the aforementioned absurdity sometimes is too much to bear for an audience. Every person in the class seems to be in a relationship or, in 'love' with people (that they've never spoken too). The heightened melodrama is pulled off well enough, but it gets excessive repeatedly. The melodrama and the violence, mixed with the intentionally odd tone, give the film a sheen of trashiness.Battle Royale is one of the definitive cult films. Some films are cult because of bad timing, being ahead of their time, or simply too quirky to appeal to a mainstream audience. This one may have spatters of many reasons, but the main one may simply be its not a good enough movie to be widely successful. Its sometimes roaring fun, its occasionally thoughtful, but often appears simply trashy, like a bloody 70s B-movie. One will often see (well founded) comparisons to The Hunger Games in discussions of this movie. And while The Hunger Games is slicker, and certainly more ambitious (though it falls short of its own ambitions more than once), Battle Royale is simply the funner film. And for all its flaws, it remains a fantastic action piece.",Battle Royale
256,gangerolf-1,"Lord of the Flies, the modern version",7,16 January 2010,"The first thing I was thinking when watching this movie was that it was pretty close to the 1963 Lord of the Flies. That is not necessarily a bad thing...OK, the script is quite different, in regards that it is set in a modern world and the reason for the combat (the main content of the movie). Still, everyone who have seen Lord of the Flies, will recognize how similar it is.I like this version, even though the storyline could be better. Most of the acting is great, and even though these actors are young, they really give a good performance. ...and that's not easy, since this is a quite violent movie. To act being hunted, being the next one to be killed, to be the killer (as the only option), is refreshingly good.As I mentioned, the storyline could have been better, or, hasn't been used to it's full potential (in my opinion). The start is OK, the explanation of ""the game"" is very good, the game itself is weak at best (many ""stupid"" turns), and the end a bit ""typical"".The ""gore"" is great if you like that kind of stuff (like I do), and if you like a merciless killing-medley.Wish more could have the guts and/or get the funding to create movies like this.

I always like to read/see the source material first so I bought the book over amazon and I have to say I loved it. It was a good story, with great characters and great writing that gave a lot of psychological insight on the characters.Based on how popular and loved this movie is, I was expecting it to be a great adaptation but after watching it, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed with it all. They take the concept, some characters and some major events from the book but there are A LOT of changes and, IMO, most of them didn't do the story any favor. It all feels a bit underdeveloped and the acting wasn't very strong either. There are also several changes in the motivation of some characters and the whole concept of battle royale shifts from an oppressive government to some sort of ""adult vs kids"" thing which, despite the fact that I'm aware of the problems japan has with the youth, doesen't make a whole lot of sense-Anyway, not a bad movie.

258,davegering,10 Rules for Survival,3,12 April 2005,"Having just seen the movie Battle Royale, I have come up with a few rules for survival that 9th grade Japanese students might find useful: 1. If your class goes on a field trip requiring a bus ride, carry a gas mask. If there is room in you pack, you might also bring along some extra blood plasma, which will come in handy if you can't get off the bus using the gas mask.2. Don't shout at your teacher. Remember that all 9th grade teachers are able to hit a moving student between the eyes at 20 paces with a throwing knife.3. If you wind up on the Island, pick the heavy survival bag. One of the bags will have an automatic submachine gun, along with about 2000 rounds of ammunition. Figuring 1.5 ounces per round, the ammunition will weigh 187 pounds. Along with the extra clips, gun and food, the bag will weigh about 210 pounds. Just watch for the bag it takes three soldiers to carry in, and claim it as yours.4. If you don't wind up with the submachine gun, keep whatever weapon they issue you. Even if it is nothing more than an ebony swizzle stick, there will come a point during the campaign where nothing but an ebony swizzle stick can save your life.5. If you manage to overcome someone with a gun, pick up the gun before you leave. Duh.6. If you get shot, play dead. It takes at least 20 direct hits to kill anyone, so if you lie still, your attacker may move on and look for new conquests. Just make sure he or she has left before you get up and start shouting about your brilliance.7. If your weapon is nail clippers, and you see the person with the submachine gun, don't charge. Look for a deep hole.8. Avoid even inconspicuous buildings such as lighthouses. For some reason, people seem to congregate in them just before going berserk.9. As soon as possible, take a course in computer hacking, so you can turn off your death necklace and crash the adults' monitoring system. Don't worry, despite its having been evacuated, there will be computers with internet capability readily available on the island.10. Take a course in maritime navigation so you will know how to pilot the yacht, unattended but fully provisioned, which you will find waiting for you on the island. When you get on the yacht, set your course to Hawaii, not back to Japan where you will be wanted for murder.",Battle Royale

This movie has humour , irony violence, tons of blood , it's shocking and super entertaining no wonder why it's Tarantino's favorite movie, it can be considered even as a satire. the biggest flaw of the movie in my opinion is that it never really go deep into the society problems that created this Battle Royale thing . Director decided to mostly focus on teenagers killing each other i must admit it works well . and tho i can see the idea behind all this it just doesn't make sense how playing Battle Royale is gonna help to solve the problem of the society in the movie, i think they could come up with some more logical reason . though to be honest plot in this type of movies hardly ever make sense acting from students is maximum mediocre but Takeshi Kitano is good Fukasaku choose to use a classic music here and it works great. i enjoyed this movie much more than hunger games which was to soft compare to BR .I highly recommend this film to any Tarantino fan",Battle Royale

That isn't really the film's fault, though. Kinju Fukasaki's kill thriller has modest ambitions and, within their constraints, it succeeds marvelously. The filmmaking is efficient and slickly kinetic; the screenplay delivers a nicely balanced mix of suspense, action, comedy and horror; and the whole is enlivened by a welcome dose of satirical social commentaryBattle Royale takes place in an only slightly futuristic Japan that seems to have degenerated into apathy and decay. The old order is collapsing, with youth in open revolt. While we never see much of this fallen world, a doomy bit of introductory exposition lets us know that things have gone from bad to worse. In response, and for reasons that remain unclear, the Japanese government has instituted the ""Battle Royale Act"". This law stipulates that each year a single high school class will be chosen to participate in a bloody fight to the single- victor finish. And so we follow one such group of unsuspecting lambs down to the killing floor.Whil the filmmakers whip us through this high-concept variation on The Lord of the Flies with verve and aplomb, Battle Royale is not what I'd call a ""character-driven"" film. Fukasaki's style is one of detached observation, and the emphasis on open-throttle intensity tends to flatten character development to a functional shorthand. This student is sadistic, while that one is kindhearted. As it turns out, this strategy works quite well. The attractive young cast portrays a simple but engaging set of high school types, and their desperate fight for survival is rendered both gut wrenching and blackly comedic, often at the same time. Certain characters do remain central from start to finish, but the film generally takes a broad and rather clinical view of the nearly constant carnage that ensues once the fight gets under way.I was somewhat bothered by the flimsiness and irrationality of the backstory. Early in the film, we see footage of a BR survivor meeting the press and fans as she returns victorious to society. The tone suggests public excitement and celebration, comparable to what might greet the winner of a reality program like ""Survivor"". Therefore, we might assume that the BR Act simply provides a decadent society with a bit of bloodthirsty diversion. But, as we later learn, the contest itself isn't broadcast, and the film intimates that the battle serves some higher purpose. This makes little sense, and the few vague clues we receive all issue from a clearly insane ex-schoolteacher, portrayed by Takeshi Kitano.Kitano's presence contributes a jolt of unstable energy to an otherwise somewhat predictable film. His performance, while unsurprising within the context of his career (the character is stoic, deadpan and quizzical, but given to outbursts of perfectly controlled violence), destabilizes the proceedings and transmits a loopy, surreal buzz. While I enjoyed the film overall, I did find myself wishing for a more sustained dose of the intelligence and bleak, elliptical humor Kitano brings his scenes.The story doesn't always make sense. The BR Act is supposed to be extremely important to the society as a whole, but the kids we see in the film hardly seem to know what it is. Realistically, every high- school class in the nation should have been dreading the call, but these kids fail to recognize even the most obvious clues. They're abducted and whisked away to a top-secret military compound where the BR Act in general and their situation in particular are explained to them in laborious detail. They STILL don't understand what's going on. Ultimately, though, realism and logic aren't crucial here. To worry about the world-building is to miss the point. All Battle Royale asks of us is that we care what happens to a bunch of good kids stuck in a terrible situation, and that's easy enough to do. The story works best when taken as a metaphorical exaggeration of current society, where children are trained to coexist peacefully with and love their neighbors, then sent out into a brutal hell where only darwinian success is rewarded. If Battle Royale fails as a reasonable ""what if"" scenario, it succeeds as an examination of the malice with which embittered age views innocent youth.",Battle Royale

The 2 main reasons why I watched this film is the story plot and the fact that Chiaki Kuriyama was staring in it being a big fan i had to give this a look. I was blown away i knew from what i heard that this film had a great story i never knew how powerful it could be. not only did give us a shocking and nerve pounding story with very interesting circumstances, but it also gave us some brilliant characters that are actually pushed to their limits in this film. the score in this film i felt personally was OK nothing special but it still gave the film that constant unnerving edge and was appropriate in heart breaking moments. I do feel the first part of the film could of been longer so we could get to know the characters better before they are transported onto the island. but overall i feel this was a brilliant film with tons of gruesome thrilling moments.",Battle Royale

The movie is just that good it is about as perfect film that i could imagine, and the performance's are superb Takeshi Kitano gives his character the perfect mix of comedy and really f**ked up dude to the role, a superb movie that everyone should see at least once.

270,Halfwaytoheaven,"Fukasaku's late, great masterpiece",7,25 February 2005,"Here is a film with the horror of Clockwork Orange and the adolescent insight to put John Hughes to shame. In Battle Royale, Director Kinji Fukasaku takes the time to love each of his characters before coldly dispatching them that many of his earlier films omitted; most of the corpses in the Yakuza Papers barely had names. Battle Royale is what science fiction was meant to be: a story in which technology is the means to the story, not the story itself. Humans, faced with the unthinkable situations that they place themselves in, struggle against themselves and each other. Of course, most sci-fi never quite reaches such extremes of nihilism, but that's kids these days, I guess. And these kids are no ordinary school children. At least three of them have murdered before, and most of them are murderers by the end. They once participated in a massive boycott of the schools, so you figure they either they are possessed of preternatural social conscious, or they're a bunch of punks who put internet chat rooms to good use. I expected them to attempt some sort of passive resistance, but some initial executions and a couple of ringers thrown into the mix squashed that notion. The episodes of varying survival strategies work well; they illuminate the reaction of different individuals while serving to relentlessly advance the plot. I loved the way a pack of girls set up an ostensibly serene and domestic clan, and then at the drop of a hat killed each other without hesitation. The tension of knowing that they had to die was underlying not only that scene, but the entire film. The students also avoid excessive reflection on their brief lives. This is natural, as a group of teenagers probably wouldn't be capable of pondering the meaning of their own existence when faced with the end, as in Ikiru, but there was enough honesty in their actions to spark many an existential conversation.",Battle Royale
271,londonscot2003,Amazing,10,17 January 2014,"I was excited when I heard about this film, apprehensive as to whether it would hold up to the good press it has received or just degenerate into another violence for kicks gore show. I was in for a shock. The film opens with a powerful introduction, dark, menacing and setting the tone of the film throughout. With teenagers behaviour crossing the line for the authorities action is taken in the form of a winner takes all competition. What initially appears to be a vague and outlandish plot with school children fighting for their lives, pitted against each other in a frantic tale of survival becomes a gripping and frightening tale of normal people pushed to far. The films action sequences are many and varied, never loosing their originality or their power. The director produces an insightful cinematic production and a host of skilled young actors take challenging roles, which could have easily become farcical, and produce harrowing and realistic characters, each as engrossing as the others. The introduction of two unidentified characters (both outstanding performances) feel a little out of place early in the story but settle well as their backgrounds are developed.Overall this is a violent and bloody story, it plot remains a step beyond the believable but this doesn't hamper the shocking and insightful nature of the piece. It will appeal to those who are looking simply for a fight flick with plenty of gore on show, but on another level it can become frightening, engrossing and truly original. To say any more about the plot would be to take away from the film; but if you can accept the violence necessary to the story line and like your pictures dark and sinister then this film is a must see. I look forwards to future works from the production team and actors alike. Excellent!",Battle Royale

Teens killing each other in an ultimate death match with all sorts of weaponry 2)Takeshi Kitano, he is awesome.3)The action. It has pretty good special effects.Now for my favourite part, the negatives.1)It was so unrealistic it isn't even funny. Nobody would ever let such ridiculous legislation pass. I swear, if you can get past the big ""no way!"" that will be plaguing your brain for the duration of the movie then you will probably enjoy yourself.2) The corny dialogue between the students or what my friends and I have labeled the ""Battle ROyale Love Fest"". Every several minutes the movie stops so two people can tell each other how much they love each other. ""You are my best friend""...""remember that time"" (cuts to some flashback)......but don't fear, those students are usually brutally murdered after this form of warp-speed character development.3) Kitano's motivations...OK we get it, teens suck. I have a feeling it was sociopath tendencies that led him to commit these heinous acts...not just being fed up with teenage behavior problems like we are led to believe. Nobody goes that bonkers...except for the nut job villain in Battle Royale 2.....which I will comment on later.4) The cliquing. OK, teens clique but when faced with ultimate demise wouldn't it be more efficient to work together instead of remembering the fact that girl number one called girl number 2 a skunk a few weeks earlier in gym class.

I wish so badly that this was released in theaters over here so it could get pummeled by the critics. Akin to most Asian ""schockers"" and horror, its all premise and absolutely nothing else. The first ten minutes is kind of cool and does a decent job (or rather not) of setting up what unfortunately turns into the most baffling mess of a movie I've possibly ever seen.A bunch of annoying brats with 30 second characters (theres like 100 of em) let loose and run around babbling about nothing while acting scared. The writing is pathetic, the acting even worse, then a tally goes up every couple of minutes in the corner of the screen signifying somebody died. How brutal. How shocking. How stylish! Lets over-analyze and get philosophical about it because its an allegory or wait, a metaphor, um, its ironic, yeah thats it.Too bad not an iota of time is given to develop anything so you could care less who's getting killed. I mean I couldn't even finish this crap. Some annoying girls started screeching about some abandoned outhouse or some crap they were trying to hide in and its like what the hell are you girls even talking about. I just had a bail on it and try again the next day. Beyond annoying. Of course this film could never be made in North America, it would be laughed out of the multiplex by everyone other than the local mallrats.A really bad movie thats been heralded as something otherworldly but is about as smart, fun, important, and digestible as the turkey sandwich I'm now eating.

In the book you get backstories for each side character, no matter how unimportant, and spend with them at least one chapter. Here they had to run through them as if they were racing to the finish line.So, the conclusion? A great film, definitely give it a try.

278,Saaska P,"Eat your heart out, Hollywood",9,4 January 2003,"Battle Royale can get very gruesome at times, but seldom, if ever, has gore been so badly needed to communicate the message. Forget painless 3-figure casualties, these deaths make themselves felt. Once you absorb the film's initial premise, you believe everything that is happening on the screen. You believe it down to your bone and your stomach. It IS happening out there to this boys and girls. You start believing like there's no tomorrow. To be sure, there is no tomorrow for many of those kids. And some of them accept it quite readily. I for one was terrified of how easily I accepted the terms of the game. How quickly I started to sympathise with some the characters enough that I wished they killed others. One even suspects that some adults might find it hard to suppress hot ready surges of a certain feeling generally manifested in the words ""serves 'em right"". And it's frightening. One keeps asking oneself questions, and those are difficult questions.Beyond the plot, this film is about how we are made what to do what they call 'grow up' and how we are made to kill each other, if not as immediately as in Battle Royale, and how we come to get used to it.
Acting is superb. I wish teens in some blockbusters (cough..cough.. Potter and the Over-the-top Acting) took a leaf out of these guys' books. Kitano was a bit of enigma to me in this one. I almost hoped he would explode with emotion towards the end, but Kitano never does that, does he?
I don't expect a Gaijin could fully appreciate the references that Battle Royale makes to Japanese political situation and school system, but their implications for a native viewer must be profound. Definitely deserves a second viewing. May not be a classic, but quite close. 9/10",Battle Royale

280,wheatdog,Fantastic,9,22 March 2005,"'Battle Royale' is unlike anything I've ever seen before. It grabs you from the start and never lets go as the startling premise reveals itself and unravels with devastating effect. A class of 9th grade school children are kidnapped and taken to a remote, windswept island and released into the wild where the sole objective is to kill each other off until only one of them remains. There are a few variables such as the explosive collars with which they have been fitted and the introduction of 'danger zones' to force them closer together but the meat of the picture details the ensuing mayhem as the children react to their situation in different ways. Some commit suicide, others panic and suffer an early fate whilst several 'alliances' form, determined to overcome their ghastly position in some way. The central underlying theme in the film is one of trust: between adults and children, friends and also family members. It's an unsettling take on how the fragile bond of human friendship copes when faced with the base human instinct of survival. What would you do, could you kill your best friend? This is the question the picture asks and it addresses it in a brutal, uncompromising fashion. The lighting is dark and sombre, a real strong point and while I don't feel the film is particularly tense the action is relentless and, at times, horrific (more so when you consider the age of the various protagonists). This is cinema at it's very best: entertaining, explosive, deep and thought-provoking, deserving of multiple viewings to fully appreciate the message it conveys.

281,atari-3,manipulative and juvenile film,1,8 September 2007,"Easily the worst film I've seen this year, possibly the worst film of all time. A Japanese twist on American reality shows, only with lots of blood. It has a high school mentality that just drags the film down to a juvenile level. One dying teenager says to another, ""you look cool"", the other dying teenager replies, ""you are the coolest girl in the world."" And so it continues...teens admitting hidden crushes and unrequited loves, then dying violently. I found myself laughing hysterically at times that were probably intended to be profound and moving. I thought maybe the director was being satirical and the whole thing was a spoof...but I think not. The ending with Kitano was ridiculous. Finally, the multiple ""requiems"" at the end was just melodrama at its absolute worst.

Lets' say that some of it's phrases have become my mottos and Battle Royale is almost a Holy Bible for me.Still, I can't understand why such an revolutionary film was made in a such rich country as Japan, because all these anti-american communist motives,which are clearly visible in this one, are more suitable to ex-USSR rather than to so-called democratic countries.Some guy in this movie says that his father was a terrorist trying to overthrow the government, then he shows him on photo where he's standing under a red flag.I thought that would be enough for MPAA to ban this film in USA, still I see a reviews of americans on this site.These reviews are mostly favourable, I can't understand that too. Since when Che was a hero in USA and Japan?I admit that acting may not be perfect here, actually only Takeshi shows us a supreme perfomance, as always. I can say that teen actors are mostly talentless but very beautiful (especially Megumi character), that fact adds a lot when you see them dying. However, it has a major screenplay.The dialogues are exceptionally perfect, it's a pity that I watched BR dubbed in Russian, while dubbing was quite good I hope to watch it again when I learn Japanese.

283,cinnamonbrandy,America's next top.... assassin.,9,23 November 2007,"Cool film. Spent since it came out until 21/11/07 avoiding it, then one person too many that I actually like, put it in their top 100, and I settled down to watch it. Bought the thing outright, too, because, for some reason, renting it would have felt skanky.I guess it's the difference between Butch & Sundance leaping off a cliff, and Bill and Ted tying on some bungee ropes. Not that eternal-sunshining it out of my brain would be an option either way - but there's something subconscious there that wants scary stuff to come without elastic on it.I had a weird sense of deja vu during a lot of the scenes. I went back afterwards to watch them again, so I could track it down.Basically the 'this is life and death/ and yet we're putting on make-up now' dichotomy is very 'America/ Australia/ continue the alphabetic listing/'s next top model'. Although I guess in that case, the dichotomy is more 'we're putting on make-up now/ but pouting like it's life or death'.'be my best friend so I can cosy up and stab you in the back!' 'i didn't mean to do that - it was all your fault, you just kinda made me cross, and then i *had* to do it, but it wasn't my fault, it wasn't anything to do with me, it just kinda happened, and i'd say sorry, but really it wasn't me, you just kinda backed onto my knife, there...so *you* apologise, bitch!' The dumb, unconvincing-yet-utterly-in-character dialogue some of the characters swap made me really uncomfortable about my old habit of tuning to Wherever's Next Top Model whenever I'm looking for a bunch of people I feel entitled to superiority over.Lawksalawdy, look at that! Hidden shallows....Good film. Life-changing - and, who knows? Maybe even for the better... too soon to tell yet, methinks.Helen",Battle Royale
284,thedarksteps,"Troubling and somewhat illogical, depending on how you interpret it",5,31 May 2011,"I think the biggest problem I had with the film is the fact that they were recruiting students that were in school instead of the 800k students that were skipping school. Unless they were possibly counting on the concept that seems evident today not only in the world's youth, but also in society, where almost everyone wants to be on some reality TV show in order to gain an almost infinite amount of fame, if for only 15 fleeting minutes.If that had been implied or more clear then I could have better gotten on board with it, however, these students had no idea what the BR act was nor did they know what the hell was going on. Unless the above was true, it would seem like the BR act would increase the dropout rate, simply because no one would want to make it to the 9th grade and possibly be part of this 'game'.Also, I think a problem with the English translation, may create some degree of disturbia, to borrow a term that doesn't really exist, for Western viewers. In the version I was watching and possibly the only version, the subtitles used the word 'mock', in reference to what the children were doing to adults. Perhaps the translation should have been 'dishonored'. In traditional Japan, honor was regarded above everything else, as such, if children were to dishonor their families, the family would demand they commit Seppuku, ritual suicide, in order for the family to regain its honor. I don't know if Modern Japan holds honor in the same regard or not, but that would make a little more sense to me than the word, 'mock'.And perhaps it would have been a little more compelling if I knew from the story that these students were the bad students from what some Americans would call Alternative School, where the reprobates go. But it almost seems that some of the students were at the top of the class in Japan. But maybe that was to also show that no matter how intelligent or civilized that one may be, given a life AND death situation, some may resort to uncivilized acts of cowardice just to survive.Also, in many of the reviews, people say that the gore in this movie is excessive. When I read that I was thinking of pretty much all of the American 'horror' movies that have been made since the 70's. But in reality, I think the gore was really on par with current American television. It was neither excessive nor overplayed, in my opinion. As an example of excessive gore, since I could really do without it in most movies, the movie High Tension was excessive or pretty much any movie made by Rob Zombie.I don't really get into movies like this anymore, a friend from work recommended this to me, having talked to him about another film that I revere as a great B movie; and along this same genre possibly the best that was ever made, Death Race 2000, the original Roger Corman film not that crappy Jason Statham remake. The great thing about DR2000 was it was intended to be a comedic commentary about basically the same thing that was implied here, an alternate path that the human race has taken.All of this said, if you're into the weird movies that employ the idea that it is okay to view teenagers getting killed by some unknown character wearing a mask, i.e. hockey mask, Halloween mask, Ghostface, etc., then you may actually like this film. Or at the same time, since it does have more of a storyline than what would be considered in 'normal' American horror movies, you may not, since it does require you to think a little more than watching Ghostface running around killing teenagers.If you were in this situation, what would you do? I would like to say that I would either kill myself or abstain from killing and let someone kill me, but since the circumstances depicted are extreme and I cannot actually put myself into such circumstances on a hypothetical basis perhaps I cannot say that I would do the above.If certain things in the movie had been clearer, then I may have given it a better rating and review, but as it was made, somewhat vague in all its details, I would say watch it first and think about it later.From most of the reviews, I expected it to be total garbage, but it was actually entertaining at face value.Maybe I should read the book.",Battle Royale

This is not my first Japanese movie (and not the first Japanese action movie either), and this acting would definitely be considered bad, but equally hilarious and even sometimes engaging and entertaining. The only actor I can think of that is not too bad is Takeshi Kitano, in his role as the teacher.The characters are not very strong, there are some weird plot holes it seems, there is A LOT of screaming of dialogue. It does portray briefly Japan's obsession with ""cute"" things (like the Info Video Girl), which I think in this context really shows how creepy and weird that can be. It also can bring some of the thoughts to Japan's problem with the increasing senior population and problems with keeping its students in school.I don't think this movie should be taken too seriously, but just enjoyed for the fun of movie watching. I don't know if the director took it seriously, but this is definitely worth a watch and you should be able to laugh about it. Take drinking games every time somebody starts screaming dialogue, don't hit their targets (although it should've been VERY easy), somebody says some weird/sentimental last words before dying, The Bad Guy is being very typical Bad Guy, a character reveals something about themselves without anyone asking or when there's a very dramatic close-up of the actor's face and their expression of terror/sentimentality/incredible sadness.",Battle Royale

Unfortunately it is the only good thing with this movie. And it is presented in the beginning.1) It is not a horror movie - I never got scared a bit - it's an action movie. And I don't know if it deserves to be called ""movie"" either. It is more like a bad TV-series. It resembles McGyver, only that McGyver is far better...2) It is very predictable. After 15 min you can guess the rest.In fact, after the Battle Royale concept has been presented, the whole film is just a long series of killings and screen updates like ""6 AM 2 dead - 34 to go"" 3) The acting is not convincing. OK, the actors are young, but it is no excuse.4) The film is full of clichés and stereotypes. The use of famous classical pieces to compensate, makes it even worse.",Battle Royale

In other words, if everyone is love with everyone else then there is actually zero meaningful romance in the movie.Interesting characters die quickly while boring characters survive. Interesting characters never fight against interesting characters, its always Boring vs Interesting. Imagine if Sickle Girl had to confront the heroes, or if Bleach Haired Guy had any characterization other than deadly guy who teleports around the island. You never think to yourself, ""Oh no, two characters I'm rooting for are fighting each other!""Just pick two or three relationships with backstories! There's no point in squeezing an entire backstory between two characters in 90 seconds before they kill each other! Forget half of these stories! Take Track Suit Girl, build up the story -- ending with her stabbing her attempted rapist in the dick -- and make it bigger!The acting is awful. Every time a character does their death soliloquy and pantomimes dying it was laughable, especially Beat Takeshi!

These two details give the work enough meaning to push it past the threshold from ""exploitation film"" to ""John Carpenter-level commentary"")As an exploitation film there are no memorable heroes or villains, just a couple of cool deaths, no stand out special FX, a lame-duck twist (Beat Takeshi was stabbed in the butt and that's when he decided to become... a lame dude...). IIRC the book's climatic battle is with characters lobbing grenades at each other while in a car chase. Probably outside this movie's budget :(",Battle Royale

292,astronic,An average realiziation of a good idea,7,22 July 2002,"In general I like the idea of this film and it hasn't been too long since I was a student myself, so I had no problems identifying with the characters.But unfortunately the full potential of the idea hasn't been realized in the movie.1) The background of the BR Act itselfs hasn't been revealed clearly enough, for me it seems rather useless for the government to choose a class *randomly* to fight each other to death. Either it's hard to believe that the existence of the BR Act has been a surprise for the students, when (at the beginning of the film) a TV report undoubtable shows what it's all about (and I'd avoid any voluntarily class activities if I only had a clue about the BR act).2) For a 10 square-km island with such a lot of trees, mountains and hiding places the ""players"" met to often by random.3) The ""I'm a virgin and want to have sex before I die""-aspect has been ignored (except for one very short scene) in the same way as the ""I'm not a virgin but want to have sex before death""-aspect. In a violent environment like this I also expected some more serious raping-attempts (not that I'm a big fan of raping-scenes but I'd increase the ""thrill"" of this movie).4) Some elements repeated too oftenly in nearly the same way, especially the ""I have a crush on x and want to 'tell her/him'/'protect her/him'"" followed by a ""oh no, he/her is dead""-cry. That sometimes really bored me.5) I'd liked to see more of 'The Teacher' (IMO one of the most interesting characters) and maybe his personel.6) I didn't like the ending, it was just inconsequent. It's a dark film which doesn't deserve such a (relatively) happy one.Besides (if you're not too sensitive) BR is worth to see and I really liked the very cynically presentation from the organziers (for example the introduction on the island, the 6h gamenews and the score as well). And maybe my criticism only relates to the subtitles which seems to be roughly done (maybe some Japanese native speaker can help out at this point).6.5 out of 10 (so I voted 7).",Battle Royale
293,PaJRJ,Ridiculous,2,11 May 2013,"OK, let me get this straight. People are all gushy over how great this movie is because of it's originality. This is the groundbreaking movie that influenced the pitiful Hunger Games with it's own skeleton filled closet of things that don't make any sense.Artistic license only goes so far for defying the laws of physics. If it's not a fantasy film where magic can explain away things that don't make sense you really should be more careful. My low rating is based on ordering a steak dinner and being served Ramen noodles.Let's start off with the random bags that have different weapons. Naturally the guy with the pot lid has been cheated and is doomed. Except naturally there is a scene where it conveniently comes in handy as a shield. But the real kicker is the crossbow and shotgun that wouldn't fit in these bags without showing them bulging at the ends because the weapon wouldn't fit.Poison the food to knock off one of your opponents. Not a bad idea. Especially when it's magic poison that kills almost instantly. And it doesn't just kill instantly, but makes the victim spew gallons of blood. Terrorists are lining up at Unsafeco to find this.Some lucky guy's random weapon is an Uzi or some other automatic weapon. It's cool to fire that weapon. The two year olds that love this movie crave the carnage. And in a scene where one single bullet would finish off a wounded opponent he pumps a clip into her. Obviously because as later scenes prove this is an unacknowledged magic gun that has an unlimted supply of ammo.I'm supposed to think that the evil people who evacuated the island have monitoring capabilities so the reports of the deaths (in exact order) can be made. OK, could be from the collars. Some idiot left a computer behind that is not monitored. Because if it was the impressive array of soldiers making sure the kids won't get away without playing by the fight to the death rules would have instantly latched on to the bomb ingredients he typed in (gotta type, there are microphones in the explosive head collars) would have swooped in and stopped that.Maybe that's because this impressive array of military play by our rules force is obviously plastic toy soldiers with a plastic toy helicopter at their disposal.I've been shot! Energy...draining...dying...cough...ugh...must climb...onto...sofa. Oh look a cookie! Let me eat that and with my dying breath declare what a great cookie it was. It must have had a variation of the blood spewing instant poison where he expires immediately after scarfing it down.",Battle Royale
294,retasulover,Truly A Future Masterpiece,10,21 February 2009,"Battle Royale is an amazing piece of authentic Japanese cinema, plain and simple.although all the performers were older than their specified characters, their performances are highly praised in my opinion, especially the way they panic when they are shown the consequences of if there is no winner. That was some of the most realistic looking panic I had ever seen.In a dystopian future at the dawn of the new millennium where poverty and unemployment in Japan is at an all time high, the adults begin to fear the children who boycott school, and thus, they pass the BR Act of the new Japanese government, in which the military rounds up an entire 9th grade class of students once a year through Impartial Lottery, and they are sent to an isolated island, where they are then strapped with explosive collars, and are forced into a game of survival, where they all must kill each other in a 3 day time limit, or they ALL die.Battle Royale is truly a masterpiece that displays the true darkness of mankind's basic instinct: survival of the fittest. What this sick game the students are drawn into is supposed to teach, is how far these students, once best friends, and even lovers, will go to save each other, or if they will just kill those important to them, in order to save their own hides.The pure, raw emotion felt by the students, from sadness, to fury, to fear, can be felt in the hearts of the audience itself, as they are pitted in a true fight for survival, where the one rule is literally ""kill or be killed"". Trust no one, for they may turn on you and you will die. Tatsuya Fujiwara delivers a phenomenal performance as the frightened and desperate schoolboy Shuya, who desperately tries his best to protect his female classmate Noriko Nakagawa, who is played very well by Aki Maeda.However, while Noriko and Shuya are trying their best to stay alive whilst their fellow classmates and best friends turn into savages, killing each other, and even themselves left and right, they must fear as they are not only hunted by their classmates, but by the sadistic and psychotic mute teenage murderer Kiriyama, who delivers a frightening presence by the performance of Masanobu Ando.another incredibly strong point of Battle Royale, is the powerful, operatic soundtrack. The orchestra work for this film is very powerful and theatrical, even for a Japanese film. This is no exaggeration, but the power of the Battle Royale soundtrack, would even make the maestro John Williams stand and applaud.For all those who are willing to see a true series of thrills and shocks, to see just how people will react when facing certain death, to truly see how human nature exists in others, give Battle Royale a very open minded attempt, for it is all worth it.",Battle Royale
295,dctcool,Slaughtering-ly Excellent,10,15 August 2004,"I can't put the film away it's just pure brilliant, the best Japanese file I've ever watched, one watch and you'll want to watch it again.The Prelude Is unusual and kinda far-fetched, apparently the Japanese Government is on the brink of collapse due to school boycotting, high unemployment rate, and over population. so the Japanese government Introduces the Battle Royale program, where each year the Japanese Government selects one unlucky school class, kidnaps them and forces them to kill each other, just a few rules:The Program lasts 3 days - Each Student has a randomly selected weapon (could be a knife, or a pan, or a gun) -They have collars around their necks that can explode, at simple command -If more than one student is still alive after 3 days, everybody diesWhat more could you want? This movie has many unexpected twists and cool fight sequences, A must see movie, This movie has many fans worldwide I'm sure of it (the most popular fan being Quentin Tarantino it was because of this film that he casted Chiaki Kuriyama in Kill Bill, thats how much he loved this film)If you haven't watched this movie you have no idea what your are missing out on,And finally if your in a high school class thats about to go on an unexpected three day field trip, you may want to thing again about going.",Battle Royale
296,ccow4140,not without its flaws but overall a great movie,8,5 February 2005,"Wow. My first Fukasaku, and what a ride it was. Despite being well prepared for it, having heard and read so much about Battle Royale, it still managed to strike a powerful chord in me. Even though the premise is beyond stupid and completely illogical the fact is the game is a fascinating one with many different options available to its contestants. Suicide, hiding, building alliances, going on murderous rampages, making a plea for peace, even overthrowing the system and trying to work out how to get the necklaces off: all these options are explored by the divergent personalities which make up the class.I think the greatest thing about BR is the fact that it forces the viewer to think about what they would do in such a macabre, insane situation (despite the fact that such a ludicrous act would never be passed in any country). The scariest and most disturbing aspect for me personally, was that i could not decide what i would do in this situation. Immediately i thought i would do the noble thing and refuse to kill anyone, but then as the movie progressed i was forced to reconsider: being honest with myself, i had to admit i probably quite easily (if put in such a situation) kill some of the a$$holes who gave me hell back in high school. In the end i realised that one cannot possibly know their reactions and the decisions they would make until they are placed in such a situation. Now to its flaws. The biggest one would have to be the ludicrous premise. How getting one randomly selected class of junior-high students to kill each other in a game of last man standing could POSSIBLY alleviate unemployment or youth rebellion is totally beyond me! The winner is supposed to then go back to normal society and become a productive member of society??!! They could only become two things: either they get a taste for killing and go onto become f&**ed up psychos, or they are so emotionally scarred by the experience they become just as f&^%ed up and have a nervous breakdown or something. I think fukasaku should have thought of a different premise for the game, something more logical and believable. Also, its just a little hard to believe the parents of Japan are fine and dandy about the fact that their kids could be picked at random to undergo this experience (a horrible grisly death at the hands of their classmates) as part of the government's brilliant plan to curb youth rebellion and kids skipping school. I've heard of suspension of disbelief but this is ridiculous!!! These flaws stop BR from being a brilliant movie and relegate it it to simply a very good movie. I think its still essential viewing for lovers of Japanese cinema though.",Battle Royale

300,stoopidmac,"shocking, violent, twisted and sick but truly astonishing.",10,6 February 2002,"I first heard of this movie from a friend. He told me about this japanese film that was coming out, how it supposedly was the most violent film ""ever made"", and he told me its name, B A T T L E   R O Y A L E Now, when i heard it was being shown at a local arts cinema, i had to go along and see it. i had heard some other rumours of its brutallity so was expecting that, but what i was not expecting is how good the film would actually be. i was actually going in thinking it would probably not be that good. A lot of films that are hugely violent are usually not that good. Usually because its too much to have to watch, along with a terrible storyline. Thats what i was expecting. Basically, BATTLE ROYALE blew me away. Some scenes sickened me, some scenes shocked me, but every scene i adored. The film is fast, stylish, violent, shocking, funny, and just sick and twisted. But all of this is for a reason. And thats what makes it so good. The violence is not just there to offend. It is there to shock you, but for a reason. i saw this film one night with a friend, and she loved it. I couldnt stop thinking about it, and a few nights later i went to see THE LORD OF THE RINGS, and it really did nothing for me. it was quite disappointing actually. But the thing is i couldnt really blame the film, as i had just seen the best film i have seen for many many years. BATTLE ROYALE is amazing. Shocking, violent, twisted and sick but truly astonishing.",Battle Royale
301,gunzar,Quite brilliant,9,4 January 2008,"There have been contrasting cries of ""greatest film ever made"" and ""pointless gore fest"" made about BR, and neither are accurate in my opinion. What it is, is a commentary about ""perceived"" (real or otherwise) problems among Japanese teens in the late 90's.In one review, someone basically likened it to a movie involving young Japanese girls running around in school uniforms acting violent....DUH, thats the whole point. A lot of peoples only knowledge of Japan is Manga and Hentai.If people bothered to watch the news once in awhile, they may know that the establishment in Japan were VERY worried about young people getting out of control, and BR portrays all this perfectly.Its NOT ultra violent, although the fact that they are supposed to be teens makes it disturbing. Battle Royale is no worse than Lord of the flies, but for some reason that has been deified as a work of art, and BR is classed as trash. I'd say its more about cultural snobbery than actual appreciation of a truly magnificent film.",Battle Royale
302,arigel,Awesome!,10,20 February 2004,"One might have to be a little deranged to enjoy this film in which a class of Japanese 9th graders are pitted against each other to kill each other. Its almost like a modern day Lord of the Flies as politics also play into the mix of the movie (9th grade politics that are often amusing).  The movie also has this over the top, rediculous feel to it which makes it very funny at times(I hope this film is not meant to be a totally serious drama). Knowing some Japanese added to the experience so I was able to better know what they were saying compared to my version with subtitles.This film is a little crazy, but all-in-all fun, definitely worth a veiwing. 8/10.",Battle Royale
303,Colmo2k4,Suspension of disbelief...and logic,5,26 January 2007,"The principle problem with this film happened early in the film. When the kidnapped kids demand an explanation of the disaffected former teacher why they are there, he explains ""they passed a law...Battle Royale!"" as if that could perfectly explain why a struggling government would attempt to curb the excesses of their adolescents by pitting them violently against one another in an elaborate game with no audience, resulting in one remaining hardened and traumatised individual. How this would actually improve society escapes me, aside from trimming the numbers slightly; human history is littered with far more effective examples of how to cull a population. Frankly, there are less flimsy premises propping up the average adult movie.From then on, I spent more time cracking jokes about the absurd premise than getting sucked in by the fear and tension of the participants, which is sad, because it could have been different. As others have mentioned, the film suffered for lacking an actual point to all the violence - nobody actually gained from it.",Battle Royale

What else can I say?If you come into this movie expecting a very thorough and logical explanation of why there is a need for an event like the Battle Royale, you'd be disappointed. The whole movie takes place on the island where the event is held. I liked the fact that the director actually included the number of survivors as each of them fall. It gives the movie an extra oomph and hypes up the tension for the final battle.Overall, a fun movie not for the faint hearted.",Battle Royale

It's unique and thought provoking! And it covered everything. Through out the whole movie I would come up with ways i would ""play"" the game thinking that I was smart but then we'd remember a rule of the game and realized that in the end we'd have to kill if we played. For example I said I'd just hide in the brushes the entire game- however you couldn't because the danger zones keep you moving.I think this has to be a great date movie! There's action for the boys, a little romance (that's a little stretch) and gives ya tons of things to talk about! I do wonder if the movie could be re-made with a little more serious tone. I liked the almost b-rated horror gore feel but part of me would've liked to see it a little more serious.................OF COURSE this could ruin the movie. Maybe it's better that it wasn't completely realistic, it would be a very dark film if that was the case.",Battle Royale
306,t-ferdy,Ignorance is bliss,6,10 January 2012,"If you think Japanese things are cool then you'll like this film. You'll probably enjoy the black and white acting, the ridiculous premise and the joke-like special effects.If you've never encountered Japanese films before, then start elsewhere. Try ""Departures"". What is interesting about this film is what it says about Japanese society. There is an underlying fear of the younger generation that this film cleverly exploits, tapping into the anxiety of the older generations. And there is the creepy love of high school students, as shown by our high school teacher and his unfounded love of one of his students. It features in Manga and Anime across the culture so it would have been nice if writer Koushun Takami came up with something a little more original.Many readers may think such criticisms are unfair, regarding Japanese culture to be too different for us to be able to judge. But there are basic principles in film-making which are broken at almost every stage here, and a general misunderstanding with Japanese culture across the world that allows a film like this to get an inexplicable 8/10 rating on the IMDb.The spraying blood and comical death scenes are not intended to be comical. Director Kinji Fukasaku experienced atrocities himself as a child, not dissimilar from some of the violence on display in Battle Royale, so it would be bizarre if he were to then parody such violence. When Japanese people watch this film (that is people who have been educated in the system and have not left the country), they experience something very different than that of most Westerners. To them, the acting-by-numbers is something they encounter in most TV dramas and movies.The misunderstandings of Japanese culture that renders this film to get an 8/10 score can be summed-up with the teacher exercising to the radio scene. To most Western viewers, this is a quirky, slightly surreal scene, which blends in with the surrealness of the whole film. But such a thing was (and getting less so now) common place in Japanese cities - morning exercise for the salarymen in their financial collectives. But there is a depth here; stabbings, suicides (of which Japan has one of the highest rates in the developed world) and the all-encumbering importance of high school are real elements of Japanese society.But there are one too many ridiculous notions in the film that ruin this depth: the internet access on the island, the cheap use of classical music to paint scenes, the one-dimensional characters and the way almost everyone gunned down, regardless of how many bullet wounds they receive, has enough energy for another bout of fury, or even to calmly make a phone call. So you'll like this if you don't understand much about Japanese society.But hey! It's just entertainment!",Battle Royale
307,Martijn,Survivor with machineguns is instant cult-classic,9,28 January 2001,"This is insanity on celluloid. The story is set in a future in which adults have grown so sick of rebellious teenagers one class is send to an abandoned island each year where they have three days to kill each other until there is only one survivor. If after three days more than one kid is alive, they'll be blown up all. This all under the 'Battle Royale' law. It's SURVIVOR, including the romances and gossip, with machineguns. Paul Verhoeven's dark future satires like 'Robocop' and 'Starship Troopers' are the best comparisons (although 'Dawn of the Dead' comes to mind too) but BR is even more violent and, if you like your humour very black, funnier. The best jokes involve Japanese superstar Takeshi Kitano as the bullied teacher who strikes back as the referee.",Battle Royale
308,dxgarten-2,A good social commentary on human conditions,9,28 December 2003,"This is one amazing film that unfortunately will simply be passed off as a shock/slasher flick by some people.  The truth is, there are some philosophical commentaries in the film.  About the failure of the education system, the generation gaps between the younger people and the adults, human's mentality of survival of the fittest. The film also shows what happens when paranoia and suspicion wins over logic and common sense and when selfishness takes over basic human compassion.I really like the fact that this film, unlike many other film that are created these days, made me think about life, about the friends that I have, as well as about humanity in general.  These days, most films are all about big action scenes with little to no meaningful story behind it.  Battle Royale, OTOH, use the action scenes to actually support the story it wants to tell. The violence in this film is used to illustrate the madness and destructive nature that humans can unleash upon one another if they let paranoia and fear of others overwhelm them.Those of you who haven't seen this film before better off not reading too many of other people's opinion of the film.  Go watch the movie, think about it, and see what you get out of it.  Don't let the hype or the cynicism over this film influence your judgment prior to seeing this film.",Battle Royale
309,Jimbeeer,Brutally captivating,9,24 January 2002,"Battle Royale is the story of a not-so-distant future, one where schoolkids have completely lost their respect for authority and believe that they rule the schools. Because of this the BR act is passed by the government. This basically means that they take a random bunch of kids every year, dump them on a remote island and force them to kill each other within 3 days until one is left.  If they disobey, try to escape or there is more than one left by the end, the collars they are fitted with will explode.The entire act is played out like a game show, with reporters eager to talk to the winner and even a display on-screen twice a day of who has died and how many are left.  Just to throw an extra measure of unnevenness to it, each 'contestant' is given a sack with provisions and a random weapon. This weapon might be an crossbow or a sub-machine gun if you're lucky or it could be a pair of opera glasses or a pot lid if you're unlucky.The thing that makes a movie like this so believable is the high emotion that runs throughout.  All the schoolkids feel exactly as we, the viewers, would. They're terrified, paranoid of each other, the meek suddenly turn in absolute psychos, some of them try to reason with others whilst others simply take their own lives.Imagine 'The Running Man' but take out the glamour and snappy one-liners of Hollywood and put in it's place 15 year olds who are very scared and very human.Remember the cold feeling you had when watching Alex beating a couple while singing 'Singing in the Rain', you didn't want to watch it but you couldn't look away, that's what this entire film is like.This film cannot be recommended highly enough and once you watch the first ten minutes you will not want to be disturbed for the full 2 hours.  Once you have seen it you'll be wanting to tell everyone about it.  I warn you though, you are in for an uncomfortable ride!",Battle Royale

Yes, the situation is horrific; yes, it is disturbing watching teens kill each other, watching friendships die as quickly as the students themselves.

I can't tell too much as it would give away some of the storyline and I was glad that they pretty much followed the book as best they could.

However, when my friend lent me the video I realised that it wasn't just good. It was the best film ever and instantly became my all time favourite. I watched it at the age of 15 (woo, naughty me), the same age as all the characters so I really related to them and the story. I thought the acting was amazing and the kids really did pull off an incredible feat, to make fantasy seem like reality. The story itself is possibly the most thought provoking of any film, because it asks the question, ""would you ever kill your best friend?"" The film answers this question with style and fluidity, diving into the depths of human psychology. Some things are very well thought out, such as how the social rejects all go completely mad and fight all out for survival, and how even best friends turn on each other after just losing the slightest little bit of trust. The tension and the atmosphere created leaves you sitting there feeling incredibly sad and leaving you thinking ""what would I do in that situation?"" I found that I could really relate to the characters, such as the fat people no-one likes and the circles of friends. Another impressive thing is how they made the love and the friendship parts of the story non-cheesy, which is quite rare in films with teenagers in. The ending is unpredictable and leaves you wanting more. And more.",Battle Royale

The young actors give a very good performance.  The tempo is very high and is greatly helped by a super imposed score board keeping the viewer up to date how the kids are doing.  One disappointment is that the really bad kids are killed off to easily.  They get through the best part of the movie slautering almost everyone between them and then they are just killed in a very lame manner.  What about a stand-off between the two? Also everything is not really made clear, but that is perhaps because I didn't pay attention.  Hope I don't end up in the next Battle Royale because of this.",Battle Royale

This is part of a government program to decrease the criminal rate as well as setting examples for the unruly teens.The acting is typical teenager type. But not as exaggerated as most western movies. It has a more 'off-camera' sense rather than 'in-the-spotlight' acting. The story is very interesting and it keeps you wanting more just to see who the new victims are in this game. You also get to see some (not much) character development with the protagonists since their inception into the Battle Royale program.The death scenes are mediocre, not all that creative, yet maybe it is their boringness that keeps you watching. The unconventional scythe to the oh-so-common crossbow are some of the weapons employed.A decent movie, -2 points because it doesn't leave you wanting more by the end. And -1 point because it is easily forgettable and doesn't have anything truly breathtaking or unique.",Battle Royale
317,consciousgeometry,Ridiculous (II),1,24 August 2013,"Literally- I burst into laughter about five times or more while watching this pathos-laden farce.I had already expected it to be a bit trashy, given its premise, but also having had a peek at its visual style etc., but assumed that there would be some facets to it that could compensate for that.There were none, of course, it turned out to be just a really, unbelievably bad and more than that, monumentally overrated movie. I don't understand how someone with an iota of intelligence and good taste (dangerous notion, I know) could find any second of this clownish, insipid construct thought-provoking or worth to be taken seriously. And I really tried, but just found myself confronted with a continuous stream of badness.I realize there's not much substance to my criticism, but I just don't know were to start, so I rather won't altogether. This is just a warning, I won't expound all the idiocy to be found in this movie.Just one little thing: Being curious about what people could possibly see in this embarrassing monument to incompetence, I looked up its wiki-article. There was one part about it being a ""maximalist satire of the modern education system"" and other allegories and metaphors, that could maybe be hidden within the stupidity that permeates every infinitesimal interval of this film--well, there are no ""metaphors"" in any conventional sense. People can associate many things with many other things: I for example associate ""Battle Royale"" with a blind man feeling around his rectum and converting the bumps he's sensing into a screenplay. That doesn't mean, that ""Battle Royale"" can take the credit for this ingenious association. It is just a meaningless heap of ridiculously unbelievable and inconsequential pathos and irrationality (and bad craftsmanship as well as acting).If it's supposed to have any deeper meaning -which would be ever so sad- it got diluted and ultimately destroyed -got its head chopped of and then blown up by a grenade, actually- by its own unfathomable badness.PS: If anyone wonders: I'm not offended or grossed out by the violence or whatever. It's just a seriously bad movie.",Battle Royale
318,megaphilip,The. Best. Movie.,6,16 May 2004,"This movie is very brutal, sad and, just great. This is the best movie I have ever seen, Kinji Fukusaku is a very talented film director. This movie reminded me of the book Lord of the Flies by William Golding. Except better. It was also originally a book. But the director then made it to a film. I find this film is very important and you must see it, in Japan it is almost your duty to see this film. Nanahara Shuya's dream is to protect Nakagawa Noriko. (SPOILER) and he is successful. Noriko becomes like a princess, because she is being protected by Nanahara Shuya and Shougu Kawada. This movie is interesting, and it shows the attitude of 42 students who are left on the island for 3 days. People kill each other, and later say that they even forgot that the people who they killed were actually their friends. This movie is very touching and sad. When you get the chance watch it. It is an important film. The teacher of these students (Kitano a.k.a Beat Takeshi) is a very lonely man, who has no respect from anyone. His wife and daughter even hate him. All the students hate him except Noriko. He was cut on his leg by a Nobu (known for the students who boycotts the school the most). Battle Royale is a survival 'game' where students are sent too. They send the students there because the students have no respect for any teachers or adults especially for teachers, teachers are human too (motto from GTO).This film was banned from the movie theatres because the parents were so against this movie, because they thought it was against their goody bright little children. In Japan it is usual to have students like this because Japan is known for having the strictest rules for schools in any developed country.",Battle Royale
319,thefiresidechronicles,Japanese Black and White Rom,9,22 January 2013,"We were asked to review this film for our show, and took it upon ourselves to do so with great gusto. Our conclusion? Sub par (not great) Aki Maeda, a personal friend of mine from our time at Hosei University, was without doubt, the highlight of this film for me. For such an inexperienced actor, she really shone through, although with this cast of obvious children (whats that about?!) that wasn't hard. In addition to this, we feel it necessary to mark it down for its release date (14th September) as this is the day after my close personal friends Mr Po Bear's birthday. Why they would choose to dampen the birthday celebrations with such a violent and gratuitous film I have no idea. Continuing on, we were shocked to find that none of the cast chose to speak English throughout production, and I have no idea how this would or could have passed through the BBFC's very strict policies about this I would assume. In place of English, we were given subtitles, which are made for the deaf. To assume that we are deaf is disgusting and downright offensive. I am shocked at this film, shocked at the content of this film and shocked that this film continues to receive such high praise. As an after thought, here are two other points, 1) They quite blatantly stole from the Hunger Games and presumably The Matrix and point b) this was film on a movie set, which implies this was not filmed for real, thus also implying dishonesty and fakery. In conclusion, 2 thumbs up, not quite 10/10, but close. Would probably watch it again, but without such high hopes.",Battle Royale
320,Giovanni_Corleone,Almost the Coolest Movie Ever,8,15 February 2006,"""Could you kill your best friend?"", goes the tagline. Well, you'd have to in order to survive this game. In the near future in Japan, the youth are unruly. They boycott school, rebel against the government, everything that cannot be tolerated in a good society. The government strikes back by picking a high school and making them play ""Battle Royale."" The students are gassed and wake up in a strange room. The army and one of their old teachers enter. Chaos ensues. After everyone calms down a little, the rules are explained by an overly-enthusiastic video, and the students are sent out into the uninhabited jungle of the island to kill each other off. The rules are as follows. 1. Each student has an unbreakable, irremovable collar that can be detonated by remote control. 2. Each student is issued food, water, and a utensil of varying usefulness (for example, a pot lid or a shotgun). 3. If there is any more than one survivor at the end of three days, all the collars explode. 4. The island is divided into section, and every day more and more sections become ""danger zones."" If you're in these pre-announced danger zones, your collar explodes. 5. If you are the last survivor, you may live and return home. 6. There are no more rules. Battle Royale is awesome. It's basically two hours of watching Japanese schoolchildren shoot, stab, cut, and axe each other to a bloody demise. Friendships are broken down as a once tight group becomes too suspicious of the others, and killing ensues. Grudges are carried out, and killing ensues. Revenge happens, and killing ensues. This is a great, realistic image of human nature to survive. Every second of the movie is fast-paced, but can still show character development, plot, good acting, etc. Go get this if possible. You will not regret it.",Battle Royale
321,SJ_1,Interesting premise but it could have been better.,4,30 September 2005,"Battle Royale's premise is very interesting and already gives it a good head-start. Imagine if a class of teenagers from a school was sent to an island, where only the last one left alive survives. It's far-fetched and ridiculous, certainly the idea that a ""transfer student"" would willingly enter themselves into the game for fun is stretching it a bit, but it's something everyone can relate to. A new spin on the countless reality TV game-shows and also, everyone's been in school, so you could imagine your school class in this position and how strange a situation it would be.However, the premise also brings problems along with it, with a class of 42, as is shown in the film, how do you present it? There's always the danger of it becoming just a couple of hours of continuous killing and violence, and how do you flesh out the characters? With a premise as disturbing as this one, any of the students being killed is shocking, but how do you decide which characters to develop and which ones to kill off straight away. Certainly the filmmakers would have had a difficult job with this concept and trying to make it into a decent film.There are, as you would expect, characters that die who we really don't know anything about except their name, but by the end all the key characters have been developed and we can now recognise them. The aforementioned ""transfer student"" is a sadistic teenage killer who we always expect to be lurking in the background, and we're cheering on anyone who's anyone to just finish him off.There are twists and turns along the way and it's suspenseful all the way through. Who can our main characters trust? Can anyone really be trusted? By the end however, it needs to come to a conclusion, and it's here where I wasn't really satisfied. It's very difficult to come up with an ending to this concept, if one is left alive as the game's rules suggest, then it's an anti-climax, if a few of them escape, it's an anti-climax. It needed something really new and original to finish it all off, and let's just say I maybe expected more from the ending.Overall, the film is intriguing and worth a watch, but it fails to deliver a really great conclusion which would have made it into a great film.",Battle Royale
322,benefaction-80731,Searching for relation with Hunger Games,3,19 July 2015,"After Hunger Games first movie came out, there were people referencing Battle Royale as possible and even better predecessor of HG movie. That surely intrigued me to watch it, and to make my own assumption. First thing to know - it is Japanese cinema, be aware of that as it differs from typical Hollywood movie you may be expecting. All along the movie I was disturbed by awful acting and unrealistic scenes - teenagers still walk after getting eight bullets in the chest and manage to speak out one passage of text, shoot someone and only then in very unconvincing manner drop down dead. This may work in Japanese cinema, but it was repulsive and hard to watch or even consider that this might be real. At some scenes it is truly ridiculous. Also there are way too many characters to create some emotional bond with the viewer. Many characters are overplayed.I would not link this movie with HG only because of the idea that there are teenagers forced to kill each other. Each has own purpose and setting, yet I would say that HG provide more believable reasoning for all killing game than BR.",Battle Royale

This movie if I could call it a movie is absolutely crap and timewasting. Very bad acting. it doesn't deserve more than 3 stars.. and 3 stars only for the idea of this film.",Battle Royale
324,Pmust-3,Disturbing,8,28 December 2000,"Battle Royale is based on the shockwave novel by Koushun Takami, which is a bestseller in Japan, and which has become very controversial in a very short time (and it is really easy to understand why). The plot is relatively simple (a class of junior high school students are forced to kill each other on a desert island, the last survivor wins and can go back home), but it is this simplicity that makes its strength. No need for a very long prologue before we enter the main act. Each of the 42 pupils involved in this ""game"" are not volunteers (no one would be..,), and of course they are forced to kill their best friends /girlfriends in order to survive this horror. The personalities and characteristics of each of the participants are of course very contrasted and even if there are some cliches, well, the worst has been avoided. There are even quite ""realistic"" (even if it is very difficult to judge what can be realistic with such a plot) moments. The transcription of the inner thoughts of the characters, which is one of the strengths of the book, is averagely well retranscripted. Takeshi Kitano plays a ""teacher"" (whose name is ...Kitano), leading the operation of surveilliance of this ""game"". It is very difficult to give an objective comment on this movie. Violent. Ultra-Violent. And bloody. This is for sure. The book has to be read for a more complete description of the hesitations and fears, but the movie restranscripts very well the book is the sense that it is all ""absurd"". There is no real meaning to this violence. The students know this, but it can not be avoided.  It is quite sad that the movie dropped an essential background element of the book (the story in the book takes place in an imaginery Japan which would have not lost WWII, and the movie takes place in a slightly modified modern Japan), but I guess that making this happen in the ""real-world"" shows that there is no need to go to an imaginary world to see to what extreme behaviors humans are capable of.Highly disturbing. Rated R-15 (forbidden to under 15), very, very violent, but nonetheless interesting.",Battle Royale
325,Tenant_Uen,"A stunning film, but with minor flaws",8,11 December 2001,"I have to own up that I only viewed two films made by Beat Takeshi, Kikujiro and Hana-bi (Fireworks as its English title), and I became a fan of his cold, speechless films. I also had the chance to view Kinji Fukasaku's 1982 blockbuster (sorry I didn't know its English Title). I see many positive reviews on this board and find many viewers bear positive attitudes toward the way the old director pictures violence among teenage kids. As a Taiwanese I have more chances than most IMDB users to see Japanese films as well as animations. Our country is awash with Japanese pop idols and we have three major cable channels dedicated to broadcasting Japanese TV shows. So actually the ""excessive"" blood-shedding scenes in Battle Royale gave me no surprise. That's the way many Japanese dramas, even TV shows, present violent events. However the tension and cinematography are still capable of shocking us. The gravity of this film also goes further than most Hollywood flicks. But from another point of view, this film is a cocktail which owes so many to previous movies. The first of course is ""Lord of the Fly,"" which constitutes the backbone of this film. ""Lord of the Fly"" has inspired a much respected comic artist (sorry, don't know how to put his name in English) to astound the Japanese readers with his masterpiece, the title may be translated as ""The Abandoned Island."" Maybe the director got more ideas from this comic, which is common in Japanese showbiz. The explosive necklace really reminds me of the 1991 ""Deadlock"" starring Rutger Hauer who plays a prisoner escapes from a hi-tech prison which contains its inmates by connecting two random prisoners through radio frequency emitted from the sophisticated electronic necklace fixed to each person. In that film, any criminal who tries to leave the prison will trigger the explosive on their neck when he/she is away from the other inmate a defined distance. The final showdown when the hero and his love shoot Takeshi only to find out he is only holding a water pistol associates the final scene of ""Falling Down"" starring Michael Douglas. Despite all the heritage the director may inherit, the key tone in this film is quite ""Japan."" I don't know how many users are familiar with Japanese comic books or animation, but awe to teenage power by the collective adults seems to be typical of Japanese. In the milestone animation ""Akira"" by Katsuhiro Ôtomo, I feel that adults, especially middle-aged males, envy young adults' energy with a sense of fear. ""Akira"" to me is a perfect example in which an ignored kid has the potential of destroying the earth, while politicians can actually do little to contain the impending  disaster. In this film I find the director is quite ambivalent toward teenagers. Most of them are appalling, while some still show a grain of good occasionally. Therefore I think the director is too ambiguous about his attitude, and this movie is too evasive. But some scenes will never escape from your mind, and idea is really cool.",Battle Royale
326,sossalemaire,Starship Troopers from Japan!,9,1 October 2002,"Having lived in Japan recently, I'm not astonished at all by this movie; you have to understand that kids are like gods there, and the ones we see in the movie lived during the bubble economy period, when japanese people could at last get some reward for working so hard for 40 years. Thus, children or young people ranging 0-30 years old in Japan have only known prosperity and easy money, are impregnated with occidental culture of selfishness, and they no more understand the values of working your soul out and giving everything to the group their parents so dearly cherished.And though I'm aware it's of course exagerated, ironic and cynical, I think Fukusaku makes a statement with this movie. ""You want to be individualists, work on your own, forget the teaching and suffering of your parents? Let's roll! But I'm not sure you're gonna like it..."". He does it in a provocative way, because he likes violence (he says it himself) and because it helps him to be heard. If I had to compare it to an american movie, I would compare it to Starship Troopers; great fighting and slaughtering scenes used to convey a message. The two movies had exactly the same effect on viewers and journalists, maybe it was even more violent with BR: some people said that it was nazi film-making, some said it was genius (I rank in the second category of course). Actors are also very good (Kitano is just his perfect self, the guy coming from previous battle is great, the two youngsters in love are such a good caricature of japanese teen TV series stars). One thing you have to understand is that only the situation is exagerated in this movie: the rest, the way japanese kids behave today, is the exact truth, no more, no less.Let's hope it can be a part of a wakeup call for this generation in Japan, or they will be in great trouble.",Battle Royale
327,binmaze,Way overestimated.,6,16 September 2002,"Gods, 7.8 rating score for this movie?You all are deceived by the stereotypic japanese style - pretending something important here.
1. The starting concept is a bit bold, but not that new if you've read any jap ani or manga.2. The gore scenes are not impressive but hilarious sometimes with some awful writings and actings.3. Some important meaning hidden behind gores? No. Absolutely not. Actually, by pretending as if there were some important meaning behind, it is masking your conscience so letting the director nor watchers not feeling guilt for such meaningless killing spree.
Conclusion: This movie is just for fun. That's all. And it's a bit wicked and shameless in the meaning that it's pretending as a serious movie and hiding its true intent. Don't let this movie ridicule you.But still, i must admit it's not a boring movie.

329,rage_k,An excellent interpretation of Koushun Takami's novel.,9,2 September 2008,"This movie is Kinji Fukasaku's legacy. With this visual interpretation of Koushun Takami's novel of the same name, Fukasaku managed to not only portray the horror described in the novel, but also keep its social commentary intact. 'Battle Royale' is set in a future where Japan's baby-boom generation have succumbed to their deepest fears and anxieties regarding the ever-widening social gap between the older adults and teenagers. The adults not only fear the 'confused' teenagers, but marginalise and punish them, as unemployment levels reach an all-time high, and the economy begins to suffer. Because of this hysteria, teenagers frequently boycott school and turn to crime as an outlet for their frustrations and the media and government frequently prey on this for their own gains, hyperbolising every case and creating hysteria and a teenage-baiting frenzy amongst the older generations. Eventually the government instigates the BR act; an act which creates an impartial lottery forcing a random high school class to take part in an all-or-nothing game of survivalism. The winner is the sole survivor. The prize for victory is life. The movie is quite often breathtaking. Not in a way which suggests facing something of beauty, but more in a way which suggests staring into the face of horror, and feeling it stare back. When I first saw this movie, I was in my last year of high school. No other movie has shocked and disgusted me as much as 'Battle Royale' did when I first watched it.'Battle Royale' is directed in an energetic, yet sombre way. The opening sequences are confused and sporadic, yet they convey a lot of information regarding the setting and the mood of the movie. The camera at times shows frenzied, close-ups of violence, and at other times remains cold, distant and detached from it. All the while during the violence, a number scrolls along the bottom of the screen, showing statistics about the violence that ensues upon the island; it really adds to the grotesque nature of the horror you are made to witness. The island which the movie portrays is shown as having been abandoned to nature, allowing the viewer to really feel the loneliness and fear that all the students face, even within the cliques some have chosen to stay in. Throughout the movie, you are given small flashbacks or clues given by other characters about their fellow classmates, the teacher and the government. Each character, regardless of how minor, adds to the horror of the film. The teenage actors in this film do an excellent job in portraying their fears, anxieties, frustrations and terror at having to outwit or kill their fellow classmates. Even when things are merely alluded to, they are often portrayed in such a way as to make it obvious to the viewer. There are many scenes from the book that simply could not be shown in the movie, but are still described by other characters or shown after the fact. The subtlety of the movie is one of its strong points. The score, utilising a beautiful set of classical European compositions, really helps to add to the juxtapositions of the innocuous and mundane with the deadly and the extreme, which are apparent throughout the movie. One recurring composition in particular effortlessly conveys the feeling of tragedy with such gravitas that it's difficult not to feel moved by some scenes. There are various actors whom you should look out for in the movie. ""Beat"" Takeshi as the jaded and amusingly deranged teacher/br game leader, Masanobu Ando as the Holden Caulfield-esquire protagonist Shuya Nanahara, Tatsuya Fujiwara as the deranged and homicidal Kiriyama, and Kou Shibasaki as the stunning, but murderous sociopath Mitsuko. They were all scene stealing actors who give staggering performances throughout.In conclusion, ""Battle Royale"" is the kind of movie that is bound to leave an impression on you, regardless of the kind of movies you normally like to watch. It's brutal, it's tense and it's tragic. Well worth a watch, especially if you can get a hold of the extended version.",Battle Royale
330,Alef442,Not a regular movie,6,6 October 2011,"Battle Royale sure is a good movie, but it could be much better.The acting isn't the best of this movie and it has some rather non-sense scenes (I don't know if this was intended or what, but I didn't like it) like the guy takes 20 shots and looks just fine, talking and everything, then suddenly he dies. Or that old ""talk to the guy you're going to kill long enough so he can grab his gun from the floor and kill you"" scene. The alternative history and the ludicrous situations on the other hand are what make this picture a good one.The movie history gives space to widely explore the conflicts between the characters, which, in my humble opinion, wasn't well done by the producers - perhaps because since it is based on a novel everything was supposed to be kept as true to the book as close as possible. Anyway, although the whole movie is about those said conflicts, it could more elaborated, more chocking, or even funnier if intended.",Battle Royale

I rate my movies with these 4 categories; Cintemography, Film making, Acting and the Overall experience.Cintemography: This movie is covered with a dark overtone to show the terror and horror that these students are feeling. When there are horrible things happening, such as brutal murders and the loss of a character that the movie has been attached to, the movie is in dark, or shadowed if in daylight, and if things are going well, everything is bright. I like this technique quite a lot because it allows me to adjust to the things taking place in the movie. 25/25Filmmaking: It's hard to comment on the film making, nothing is wrong with it, but I haven't seen any special techniques they used to make anything more dramatic, none the less, he has timed camera angles right and the editing is superb. 25/25Acting: For 15-16 year old actors, this movie has amazing acting. It makes it more so that they are in the middle of a sado-masochistic game of killing your own friends for survival, and they play out the parts well. The movie has different characters that show different emotions; the male protagonist isn't bent on killing anyone and is trying to get a way off the island, where as the male antagonist is a psychopathic murder and is enjoying this game. Amazing acting. 25/25Overall experience: This movie has an amazing story for an Action movie, and kept me on my toes wondering who is next on the death list, and how the movie will end. It is a very entertaining movie, and has a very deep hidden meaning that could connect with younger audiences, although this movie is extremely graphic and is not for anyone under 15. 25/25Overall score: 100/100",Battle Royale

335,franck-25,A disturbing marvel,10,18 September 2006,"I think this is the strangest film I ever saw : I liked it so much and it's difficult to describe why. Yet, I must pay deep respect to Kinji Fukasaku for such a masterpiece.A masterpiece ? But this is all overacted ? Yes it's true ! The photography is not really nice ? It's true ! The plot is somewhat strange like the mobile phone scene in the end ! It's also true ! But all these defects tend to create a mood going from very serious (the movie can be very disturbing at times) to quite stupid (especially those romance scenes) and it's the contrast between the two which is the message of the movie.In fact, you have to read the novel to see how Fukasaku's made a marvel here. If I had read the novel before, I wouldn't even have tried to watch the movie. Because it seems impossible to adapt it to the cinema without loosing it all. Yet Fukasaku's made it. And it really seems that all the defects in this movie like the overacting and the stupid romantic scenes are here to put the spectator in such a mood that he will understand by himself what was the essence of the novel and what seemed to be unexplainable with pictures rather than words.It's a movie about the transition from the innocence of childhood to adulthood. You have to see the battle with all it's harshness as a metaphor when young adults discover the bad sides of life. When you see all the romance scenes, just remember when you were a teenager and try to get in such a mood only to be disturbed by the next violent scene. A few minutes after the fight officially begin, the movie will start to capt all your attention. And sure, you'll remember when you were young and start to identify with the characters.In the end, the movie has a hopeful message for all youth discovering the world of today. It tells them not to refuse fight but to accept it. But to still trust the selected few who will become your true friends.

Anyhow, this film is set when society is just gone wrong, and the Battle Royale law is passed. The part that's hard to believe is that any society with parents could let a law pass that would allow a group of children to be picked at random to go to an island and be expected to kill each other off until only one is left. If you can look beyond that, which isn't too difficult as the drama of it all is so gripping you can get past that (until its over and you're telling your friends about it, and they look at you with that look...).Men will want to see this film just to see the young Japanese girls rolling around shooting each other with machine guns with their petticoats showing under their short skirts, and some girls too!!Its kill or be killed, and it shows how anyone might try to survive when thrown into this situation.",Battle Royale
337,deadlypen,A Haunting Film That Demands Repeated Viewing,10,15 March 2006,"The Place: Japan. The Time: The not-so-distant-future. Faced with the prospect of losing control over the nation's young people, a totalitarian government decides upon a ruthless demonstration of power. The Battle Royale Act annually sends a randomly-selected class of high school students to an uninhabited island where they are compelled to kill each other until only one of their number survives.The reasoning behind this bizarre piece of legislation is perhaps the weakest part of the plot - but the Director deftly causes us to suspend disbelief by drawing us surely and touchingly into the feelings of the young cast. Unlike many western movies which trot out a body count of simplistic characters who are only there to die horribly for our entertainment, Battle Royale somehow manages to rapidly introduce us to the story's potential victims and make us care about them.You will read reviews that describe this film as excessively violent. I believe that this is a gross overstatement. Though there are many deaths and not a little blood, the main emphasis is upon simple human values - issues such as trust, friendship, love and hate - which the competition tests to their very limits. Children who have little genuine experience of living are forced to evaluate their relationships with each other if they want to stay alive. Alliances are formed and broken; long suppressed crushes and barely buried antagonisms influence their decisions.There are no easy or mindless deaths in Battle Royale. The violent scenes make the point that violence and death are not cool or funny. This is not Kill Bill; every character in Battle Royale has value as a living, breathing human being. It may sound corny to say that the movie is an emotional roller-coaster ride, but it truly is - having dared to give us three dimensional people who bleed when they are cut, the Director sometimes further dares to cruelly follow scenes of tragedy with jarring moments of biting, dark and sarcastic wit.If this was an American movie, the class would be played by people in their twenties and thirties. Two or three of the students would be given a lot of screen time and the rest would be faceless cannon fodder. Five seconds after the opening titles, you would know who was going to survive. Despite its odd premise, Battle Royale seems closer to reality because its teenagers really are teenagers and it allows no comforting certainties about who lives or dies.The true genius of Battle Royale lies in the talented playing of the entire cast. Although young, not one of them strikes a dud note and the script gives almost all of the students a chance to shine at some point. The fight scenes are not staged in the style of 'Enter The Dragon' - the kids are not weapons experts or Karate champions. We see them kill each other but we are not invited to hate them - they are, after all, children and they are scared and desperate. Even a student who takes to killing with apparent relish deserves our sympathy.Some reviewers have criticised aspects of the dialogue as unrealistic. There are certainly times when the script seems stagy - but it is important to remember that these Japanese children are products of a national culture which often finds the expression of passionate emotions problematical. If anything, the formal phrasing and awkwardness of their most heartfelt expressions only serves to make them more meaningful.The Special Edition ends (quite literally) with a question. You will find yourself going back to this movie time and time again to answer it. Each viewing is rewarded with details that you probably missed previously - the depth of characterisation and the layers of hidden-in-plain-sight clues continually allow you to understand the story from fresh perspectives.",Battle Royale
338,zakthomasnz,This Film Echoes Brilliance,10,24 December 2018,"A majority, of the other reviews share a note of displeasement with this movie. Understandably so, but the complaints are centred around the acting and B-movie quality stuff, this is not true at all. From the context of modern Japan this film makes perfect sense, through not wasting time on morals etc. this film is able to delve into some areas that are very true to contemporary Japan. Japan as a culture is all around its youth and respect, however, the millennial generations of youths globally (not exclusive to Japan but certainly inclusive) are voiding respect. This film is truly genius in the way it comments on this through its darkly comedic tone and excessive violence because this excess is based around minor dilemmas in the youth. This essentially demonstrates the growing rudeness of our youths, in a not so obvious way. This film boasts subtlety and truly is worth your time.",Battle Royale
339,stoned_bunnies,A compelling & haunting masterpiece.,8,10 June 2006,"Based on a Japanese novel by Koushun Takami, ""Battle Royale"" is the story of a group of ninth graders who are transported to a small isolated island with a map, food and different arms. They are told to fight each other for three consecutive days until there remains but one student, who will then be named the 'winner'. All students are forced to wear a metal collar with a radar so that their teacher is aware when a rule is being broken.The film is set in Japan and is in Japanese (and if you do come across a dubbed version, dispose of it immediately because it's only worth it to watch the original). It's hard to classify this film, as despite the extreme violence in it, it isn't action and despite its nightmarish feel, it isn't horror. It's just in between. There are many themes to this story; from to trust to complete selfishness (killing your best friend to save your own life) to suicide to disloyalty, and the list goes on.The actors in Battle Royale were amazing. It is rare to find young talents like these, for instance, in Hollywood. These actors were by far the best young actors I have seen in all my life (though most of them weren't as young as their characters were). Tatsuya Fujiwara plays the main character, Shuya, a young man who is struck by tragedy when he becomes an orphan. All he has now is his best friend and the girl with whom he is madly in love. Fujiwara did a great job of transmitting the feel of despair that one would probably feel if he/she were to see his best friend die before their eyes, or to have to see classmates killing each other and then to portray that never-ending trust that two lovers share. The other actors all did a generally good job as well.The first actor I'd like to criticize is Taro Yamamoto, who played the compassionate Shougo Kawada, who helps the protagonist and his girlfriend as the game of Battle Royale goes on. I thought that Yamamoto overplayed the character's casualty and I didn't feel as attached to him watching the movie as I did reading the comic book. The other actor I thought did a terrible job relative to the other actors was Masanobu Ando, who played the haunting character Kazuo Kiriyama, who basically seemed immune to everything. While reading the book, that guy really creeped the sh*t out of me. But in the movie, he just basically did the ""undercover"" thing and sort of leaped from place to place and tortured and killed people and that was it. You didn't feel anything, and in my opinion, that character was one of the most important so it was pretty disappointing. But putting those two aside, the acting WAS splendid, just as the directing of (sci-fi/Japanese gangster movie director) Kinji Fukasaku was.I thought that the story was very haunting and compelling, and that you should read the novel or the comic book before watching the movie because just the use of your imagination and attachment to the characters while reading the books is so much more real. I really enjoyed the movie too, though, and would recommend it to anyone who has the stomach for constant shootings, hangings, blowing-up, abandoned corpses and a lot of blood squirting everywhere.And so if it fits the shoe, rent it out. You probably won't regret it.",Battle Royale

With the score reminding me of A Clockwork Orange it too has a view on lost values in our time. Set on an island where 42 students are send to kill one another off to win. But not only do they concern themselves with surviving but also normal teenage troubles of who is in love with who, sexual debut and popularity. Takeshi Kitano is the antagonist, and he does this with the usual believable reserved play, constantly showing a conflict lurking within him too. See it, it is a most!",Battle Royale

Then they are on a school bus on their way to school when suddenly they all pass out for the exception of Kanahara, some mean lady knocks him over the head. Finally the kids that are on the one school bus is brought to a class room where it is explained to them that for three days they all stand on their own and must kill one another to win the game of Battle Royal. They are given Bread, water and a weapon. The weapons are suppose to be random and everyone for the most part receives something different. They must fight for their lives against all students but there are a few that choose to team up and fight the corrupt adults.It does rank high on the Originality meter as well as the boldness meter. However, this movie is definitely not for your average movie watcher or movie fanatic. The film is full of disturbing content. The film contains very strong violence and gore all involving teenage kids. Some kill out of desperation but there are a few that seem to genuinely enjoy decapitating or killing a fellow student with a machine gun. The way in which the kills are done could be considered a little humorous in a deranged dark way. Another way to describe the movie is a teen-aged social satire.For you big film fans out there make sure you watch this movie if it is ever available to you.

I also liked Kitano (i still don't believe that i didn't know much about Takeshi Kitano until i saw Brother some weeks back!)character: cold, sadistic, a disturbed teacher that i really didn't wanted to have in my classes...hmmm, something tells me that if more teachers liked that existed, the ""bad"" students attitude would disapear from schools.Of coursy, there is some things that could be explained better (maybe the book from which is based explains better?) but those are minor.Many congrats and thanks to all people involved in the differents areas and aspects of the making of this masterpiece!!!

But I guess the horror in this movie is not on monsters and ghosts and etc... but on teenagers! It could be a really disturbing for those politically correct.. I just found few flaws in this movie.. *SPOILER* I think the actors could just be less exaggerated when dying.. It looked like they had time to say whatever they want, and just in a click, they die! I mean, that looked pretty funny to me.. Also that scene at the lighthouse, when the girls start shooting themselves.. The fact that led to that scene was pretty interesting, but I think that the acting there was pretty artificial.. I don't know if it was that the Japanese's way to act is pretty dynamic. But IMO it happened very fast.. That didn't happen only in that scene, but in some others too. In a movie like this, you have to explore more the emotion, and the drama.. The director didn't too much, in scenes like that. A powerful movie, if you watch not-caring-at-all, you won't care at all for the characters.. I'll look like an adventure movies and all that fantasy stuff.. But the rest, it's really good. Believable characters, and nice dramas as well.. Worth a watch, with attention.. I mean..

348,theolonius,"Disappointing, if you know the source",3,27 April 2015,"If you enjoyed this movie and you were OK with the violence I strongly suggest you should read the novel and/or the manga (both far more violent and more suspenseful).Even though the manga also isn't completely true to the novel, it is still very close for the most part and keeps the characters intact, at least enough, and it gives an real insight on the characters backgrounds and their motivation.The movie is just a very dull attempt bringing it on the big screen. Of course, it was a stupid idea to begin with. The runtime of a movie can only handle a limited amount of content.It is for good reason many critics remarked the characters remained shallow. Just like his younger western counterpart, Tarantino, Fukasaku makes movies based on a somewhat intriguing setting and fills it with action, but can not develop a character or bring any actual psychological drama to it. So effectively, the Fukusaku-family really disgraced Takami and his original story for bringing it to a format it can not fit in and for trying to turn it into an action blockbuster.I still rate this movie 3/10 for a) the remains of Takamis book b) some of the actors did a solid job and c) the acceptable production value.",Battle Royale
349,django822,Brilliant,10,17 January 2014,"Forget Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. This is the best film to ever come from the Far East. Ever. It's been banned in 4 countries, but it's not the sort of film that deserves that. No sexually explicit scenes, just extreme violence. Violence is seen in most modern films. Like so many good films, it can be viewed at two levels. The meaningful one, which delivers a hard-hitting harsh portrayal of how society can degenerate in the hands of a poor economy and inept government. This is an admirable and shocking film in that respect. I have to admit I was genuinely shocked when I first saw this film. If this doesn't appeal to you, it can be taken at token value as a hackfest of a film in which children kill each other in increasingly gory ways. The truly great thing about this film is the way the children are portrayed. You see how they react differently and shockingly to the contest, by laughing it off until they cop a bullet in the ribs, or taking their own lives because they cannot face killing their friends, or forming gangs built on fragile trust that can be broken in a heartbeat. Truly shocking, yet riveting in a way that makes you unable to stop watching. It's acted by real children - not famous children bred on success. That really really adds to the films effect.As I said, this film can be taken on two levels. I seriously suggest seeing it firstly as a shocking and realistic film. The emotive power of this film beats anything I have seen before.Excellent. Get it.",Battle Royale
350,cwd9000,The Best Japanese film I have laid my eyes on,10,13 July 2005,"I couldn't believe my eyes. Out of all of the horror/survival films I have ever seen, this is definitely on top of the list. I don't just mean that in terms of foreign films, I mean in terms of film. I was immersed into this crazy scenario that may seem absolutely ridiculous at first, but once you look at it, it almost turns into a not so outlandish thought.The story is laid out like this: Japan has is going down the proverbial crapper. Unemployment is at an all time high and kids everywhere are boycotting school. The country is in chaos. The government decides to pass a law that is basically aimed at scaring the country into order. The Law is called the BR Act. Heres the crazy part. A class is selected by impartial lottery (and the grades seem totally random, as indicated by the shot of the 1st or 2nd grader in the opening sequence) and sent to an undisclosed, evacuated location. The classmates then have 3 days to kill each other off until there is only one student left. This year, it is a class of 9th graders (keep in mind that Japanese kids go to school year round. in our school years, these kids would be seniors). They are sent to an island, given weapons, and fight to survive.The cast in this film is chock full of Japanese Stars. Kitano Takeshi (Kitano) plays the teacher that basically plays the ringleader. If you have watched spike TV, you have seen him before. This is the actor that plays as ""Vic Ramono"" on MXC. The rest of the cast is comprised of Japanese teen pop idols. Most notably, the gorgeous Chiaki Kuriyama (Chigusa). You probably know her too. She was Gogo Yubari in Kill Bill Vol 1. Ando Masanobu (Kiriyama) plays the most menacing villain I have ever seen.Asside from the classic Japanese blood sprays and the amount of ammo some of the guns put out, there is great attention to detail in this film. From what I have read, since the author (Kinji Fukasaku) of the original book directed the film, everything is kept true to the book as close as possible. Every time a student dies, their names appear on the screen in the order they died. Inside the main building, there is huge system of screens that show who is dead and what not. Anyway, that screen is exact on the names as well as the 'danger zone' map. I had to look twice to realize that. That is damn good editing right there.The characters in the film, though Japanese, can be related right back to the kids you knew in high school. I joke around with my friends all of the time saying, ""Oh thats so and so"" and, ""oh man, that is definitely so and so."" This brings so much depth into the film. It is simply amazing to watch how everything plays out. This is like Darwinism in the 21st century. I watch this film just saying, ""this is what would happen."" That is what the entire film is based on, the crazy idea of 'this could happen.' The whole tag line of the movie is, ""could you kill your best friend?"" The question is so spooky, I don't even know if I could answer it. It taps into something so deep that you really have to think about it.This film does have some comical moments. It is just too damn funny to watch Takeshi Kitano sit on a couch and eat cookies while at the same time watching his former pupils kill each other. There is just everything in this movie. There are those love stories that you saw all too often in school as well as those feuds between certain cliques and egos.If you want a superb psychological thriller, this is the movie. This film sent shock waves across Japan when it burst onto the scene. Intelligent writing, great acting, beautiful locations, and decent effects bring this film together. Its Lord of the Flies with High School Kids. Its just great.10 out of 10",Battle Royale
351,bumfromkorea,Intriguing Social Commentary Tainted By Awkward Execution and Plot Elements,5,29 July 2006,"Battle Royale... When I watched this film, it was right before I was planning to go to sleep. Bad choice, I realized, at the end.Battle Royale starts off quite vividly, albeit rather awkwardly. The little girl ('winner' of this year's Battle Royale) smiles, and right there is one of the most haunting scenes I've seen in movies. It starts off very strong (though I say awkward because the movie goes straight to the island without properly introducing to the audience of the dystopian future), and keeps that strong tone to the scene where they are briefed. The 'instructional' video seems to be a strong commentary on the modern Japanese culture (talking about killing each other as if it's a game)...The brutal killings among students are simultaneously the movie's strongest and weakest point. The first official death among students (crossbow through the neck) comes as a systemic shock, and works very well to demonstrate the absurdity and the horror of the situation.This is where I will stop my praise and start my criticism.Perhaps its because the movie uses many young actors, but every single death scene in the movie seems almost comical in its awkwardness. The cliché 'gasp-and-die' acting is constantly repeated, and most wounds inflicted on each other are pretty unconvincing (especially the wounds inflicted by the SMG).In addition, the movie fails to keep its tone consistently by inserting unnecessary romance. The relationship between Shu and Nakagawa is understandable, and even serves a meaningful purpose. However, the auxiliary characters' romantic scenes seems awkward, out of place, and serves absolutely no purpose in the story.The single greatest fault I find in this movie is the purpose each death serves. In this movie, deaths are violent and horrific NOT for the sake of the main message of the film, but for the sake of shocking the audience. At the end of the movie, most deaths that occur seem almost pointless - an orgy-like death-fest similar to that of the torture scenes in Hostel. This is further proved (at least to me) by the fact that the ending on the boat seems completely fragmented from the rest of the movie. We feel no desperation, no sense that we have just witnessed the death of 40+ people in the most brutal manner - and this is not reflected on either Shu or Nakagawa either.In the end, Battle Royale is destroyed by what could have made it a great film. Instead of being a sharp social commentary on modern society using horrific situations, it becomes a repetitive sequence of terror scenes that forgets its purpose and collapses on itself. Not for the faint of heart.5/10",Battle Royale

It came highly recommended from one or two of the guys as a lesser-known but good Japanese film.After about 20 minutes I started checking my watch and by the end had already volunteered to do the washing up. If this movie has a point, then clearly I need someone to explain it for me. There is no discernible plot line, it suffers from clichéd direction, the acting is awful and the effects are as cheap looking as early-eighties straight to video horrors.The whole film is an excuse to show Japanese girls in really small skirts with the added bonus of having high-school children shoot at and kill each other. It borders on pedophillic (working on the presumption the cast were all over 18, if not then it would be pedophillic), uses over-the-top, bad effects and serves absolutely no purpose as a social commentary or even has one iota of entertainment value.It is just plain sick.",Battle Royale
353,thetragicfigure,"Nothing sublime, but worth viewing",8,23 March 2004,"What's most amazing about this film to me is the sort of unconscious hype that it seems to generate on its own. The idea is so compelling that it sort of makes the film better than it actually is.A friend -- not having seen the film yet herself -- told me about this film after reading a plot summary: ""9th graders forced to battle to the death over 3 days!"" I was certainly intrigued beyond myself, and I put it on my to-watch list. Surprisingly though, after watching the film two months later, I found that all the hype exhausted itself rather quickly. It was all very entertaining to watch, but I found that my only sincere reaction was to imagine myself in the same circumstances as these 9th graders and to wonder how I might approach the game. And the answer came immediately: I'd simply be a suicide and refuse to play (I'm not one for murder). Having made that decision immediately, the film became merely an exciting kind of action flick. And that's not to be discounted (I love Bergman, Welles, and Lynch, but DIE HARD is also one of my favorite flicks); for me, the next hour and a half was merely just fun to watch. But in the end, t'was nothing too deep, no mining of the depths to which to modern society has sunken in its idolatry of the individual and his personal survival at the cost of his peers, blah blah blah....But it IS a pretty good action flick with a valuably untouched idea -- and that's worth something, I think.Just barely 8 out of 10.",Battle Royale

Usually movies that are extremely violent have no good plot to it but this movie not only has a good plot, but everything that follows is all solid. The students in the film stand out the most, no matter how small their roles are, because they really do look like 7th graders. The 7th graders are thrown into a situation where they have to kill each other in three days or everyone dies. Not only that, two transfer students (A former winner of the contest and a crazy mo-fo who signed up for fun) are put in the mix as well. It's amazing to see how everyone reacts cause every type of reaction to this kind of situation is shown. Some commit suicide, some form alliances but suspicion tears them apart, one girl goes around getting back at those who hurt her and some try to say their goodbyes to the ones that they loved. It's just an amazing film, something that you can't see here in America since good movies isn't really a trend here.

In this game non-participation, through suicide for example, really does seem the easy way out.
There are a few clinches, the subtitles seem to have been written by someone with a slightly shaky grasp of English and in this world of Big Brother and micro TV cameras it seems strange that the game takes place with no media coverage beyond the announcement of the winner.Despite this and the violence which is sustained and graphic I found it a gripping and thought provoking film which I would thoroughly recommend.",Battle Royale
359,opium_nick,Very pleasantly surprised... in awe! Watch this film!,10,25 February 2002,"The basic premise is that in the very near future youth violence is getting out of control so the government introduces the Education Reform Act, under which a randomly selected school class is forced to fight to the death as a deterence! This is a pretty far fetched storyline and I thought the film would just be a comedy live-action manga-type gore fest but the film was actually really good.It has a great mix of subtle black humour and really good acting and characterisation so that you actually feel sorry for the kids instead of laughing as their blood sprays across the screen! My main worry was that it would be pretty pointless and dull after the novelty of watching the kids get splattered wore off but the plot was really well balanced and constantly interesting without getting stupid. The other thing which made it great (and surprised me) was that the violence is NOT comedy gore but actually really graphic and nasty - I flinched quite a lot and I love gore flicks. Despite a huge cast (41 classmates) the film manages to give them all at least a bit of real character. Most arent particularly developed but that doesnt really seem to be the goal of the film. You just get enough of a snapshot to feel sorry for them before they get butchered.The best thing about the film is the way it balances between realism and a slightly surreal stylised approach.On the negative side, the basic premise of the film is rather far-fetched. The class seem generally quite innocent rather than violent delinquents (there is one out of place incident which tries a bit awkwardly to imply this). The film doesnt portray a society in which the tournament would be acceptable and the kids dont seem to know that it exists until they become part of it(!). There is also no TV coverage of the fight so whats the point apart from for the teachers sick pleasure?! Why not just kill them or select a bad class rather than a random one? I am guessing that the book explains this better.Once the film gets going however, its so good that you forget about the unrealistic setup and it becomes quite believable. The intro is dispensed of quickly with some black humour and plenty of style to make way for the main film. Another great part is the use of little voiceovers and flashbacks for surprisingly effective characterisation. There are some parts where the screen goes black with just some text which seem odd but dont detract in anyway (though I would have thought dubbed versions of these would seem tacky - dubbing sucks!). The teacher character is played particularly well, balancing between comic book violent comedy character and a real emotional person.There are errors than I have seen other reviewers point out. For example, someone asked where the computer hacker guy got a laptop from... well the students did all get to keep their personal stuff and he obviously already had it. However, there are other inconsistencies, especially at the end. The finale is a bit over twisting but is surprisingly good.In conclusion, this film is an excellent mix of stylised violence, fairly subtle black humour and good acting. Its is not at all a really deep philosophical film as some have suggested and if you approach it expecting this or for deep characterisation you will be disappointed. What it is is an excellent over-the-top action flick, but one that actually has good acting, an exciting premise, a very balanced plot and manages to get a surprising amount of depth in for the type of film it is. The best description I can come up with for how I felt after seeing it was like having just watched The Cube, The Shawshank Redemption and Dawn of the Dead at the same time!A great film for fans of action & gore flicks and pop culture who also like some depth and good old human spirit :DOn a little extra note. I bought it on the PAL region 0 DVD and the quality and presentation is excellent. The version I saw was also the Japanese version with English subtitles. Japanese films like this are ALWAYS better subtitled rather than dubbed because the voice actors for dubbed versions are usually poor at best and make it into a joke so I would recommend you dont watch a dubbed version!",Battle Royale
360,kookytree,Every teen movie you've ever seen....on acid and with a dirty great gun,8,10 October 2003,"Contains Spoilers! Battle Royale"" is undoubtedly the most notorious and controversial of the handful of millenial Japanese films which have managed to crossover into the West- this group includes the original ""Ring(u)""; ""Audition""; and ""The Eye"", and- to a lesser extent, ""Ichi the Killer""; ""Dark Water""; ""Suicide Circle""; and ""Lily Chou Chou"". The concept is as audacious as it preposterous, the best one-line pitch ever made: 40 nattily outfitted Japanese schoolkids are given a menagerie of weapons and forced to kill each other. A lot.
However, the film never really lives up to such a brutal and frankly exhilarating concept. For one thing, it's not as shocking as one would expect. You will wince two times during the film- when a girl is shot at close range in the stomach with a machine gun, after already being fatally injured by the designated psychotic (the inexplicably afroed Kiriyama); and when a boy is stabbed repeatedly in the groin with a flick-knife by the petulant Chigusa, (played by Chiaki Kuriyama, who is currently riding high as Lucy Lui's henchwoman Go-Go Yubari in Tarantino's ""Kill Bill""). There is undeniably a veritable geyser of blood and gore spouting from every frame of the film: heads are severed; mouths are stuffed with grenades; collars explode against windpipes; sickles are scraped against necks and torsos; axes are thrust into heads...but the violence itself is oddly unaffecting. Or perhaps I'm just scarily desensitised.It is also notable that the violence itself is not glorified or used to excite- it's gritty, difficult, and unchoreographed. When the black widow Mitsuko struggles with the cutesy Megumi (who is clearly doomed from the moment the former shines her flashlight onto her own pallid, pretty face, grinning like evil in pop socks), the sense of struggle and sweat is palatable. This isn't pretty, stylised, ""Charlie's Angels"" style girl-on-girl action, designed to titilate. It's two fifteen year old girls battling desperately and awkwardly for their very lives. And for this realism at least, the film should be commended.One of the best things about the ingenuous concept of the film is the sense of a gameshow, of having to guess who will win and how they will do so. However, in ""Battle"" it is clear as soon as Shuya Nanahara, in a flashback commencing the film, drops to his knees in shock at the sight of his own father hanging from the ceiling, that Shuya is a shoe in. The actor playing him looks scarily like an anime character, as does his companion, the watery eyed, impossibly cute Noriko. By championing these two innocents, the film both tries to give a moral compass and centre to itself, and detracts from it's most fascinating element. This element? In a word: Mitsuko. The ""bad girl"" of the class, she steals every scene she is in. She acts like an utter beyotch throughout the span of the movie, and yet, in her death scene, director Fukasaku turns the character completely on her head and makes her the most sympathetic member of the class. In what is perhaps the best scene in the film -infinitely more disturbing than the happily sprayed blood that coats the surrounding scenes- we see Mitsuko as a child come home to an alcoholic mother who accepts money from a paedophile for some quality time with her daughter. The man takes the utterly contemptuous child Mitsuko to her room and produces a Barbie-like doll from his hands. ""See this little girl!? She's called Mitsuko too! Isn't she fun!"" The camera then lingers on still images of the carefully removed, tiny clothing of the doll spread on the bed. ""The doll Mitsuko has taken off her clothes! Now it's time for the real Mitsuko to..."" He leans in on the girl, and she screams, then pushes him down the stairs to his likely death. While this feat of strength is almost comedic in it's unfeasibility (indeed, this is a film that laughs in the face of logic- then stabs it), it makes us understand the teenage Mitsuko infinitely better. This is a girl who has always been alone, who has always had to fight to survive. When, just a few minutes later, her voice drawls ""I just didn't want to be a loser anymore"" over the sight of her sodden dead body, it's genuinely affecting. And herein lies the strength of ""Battle Royale"".This is quite possibly the closest the film industry will ever come to portraying schizophrenia on celluloid, for I've never seen a film that so adroitly and quickly changes the mood of a scene, or the audience's perception of a character. It does it with Mitsuko (played wonderfully by the delectable Kou Shibasaki), and it does so with Chigusa. We first meet her when she, again inexplicably, (a word that can often be invoked when discussing this film) is training for her running in a yellow tracksuit (which is obviously the first thing one would do when thrust on an island to be killed by friends). We delve into a daydream sequence in which she imagines engaging in warm banter with her crush as she runs. The lilting music and wonderfully expressive face of Chiaki Kuriyama mean we instantly like Chigusa. However, when she sits down, muttering her crush's name longingly, another boy comes onto the scene, and out comes Chigusa: Picture of Teen Petulance. She rolls her eyes, she snakes her neck, she flicks her hair and she spits sardonic insults at the boy like a hungover snake. And the audience immediately draws itself away from Chigusa. Then, when the boy accidentally shoots her, she chases and kills him in the most savage example of brutality seen in the entire film. She screams and wails and stabs stabs stabs, and it can't even be justified as self defence. You get the feeling this Chigusa chick isn't quite all there. Then who should appear on the scene but Mitsuko, grinning like an angel, gun poised. Chigusa runs but is shot, and we see her drop down a ravine. She breathes heavily and, just as we think she will die, her crush appears. She thinks it's a dream, but it isn't, and what follows is a wonderfully accurate portrayal of teen affection, and the inadequacy teens have in articulating how they feel about each other. While I myself am a teen, I personally rarely invoke words of over three syllables when in 'the real world', with the exception of 'alcohol', 'cigarettes', and 'ketamine'. So when Chigusa trembles her last words, silently wishing (as we are told through subtitles) that she can sum up her love for this boy in one sentence, it's the funniest, most poignant use of bathos I've come across. ""You're really, cool, Hiroki"". Chigusa has gone from Sweetie to B!tch to Psycho to Tragic Hero in the audience's mind in barely ten minutes, and though she is hardly in the film, her role defines the madness and ultra-melodramatic twists and turns that characterise ""Battle"" in a way none of the other characters do. And it doesn't hurt that Kuriyama puts in the best performance of the film.
This theme of changing audience perception in an instant is carried on into what is without a doubt the best and most infamous scene in the film: the lighthouse scene. We meet a seemingly happy and optimistic group of girls hanging out in the island light-house, discussing their chances of survival and possible ways of getting off the island. However, one member of the group -the diminutive, glossily-haired Yuko- is silently unhappy. Shuya was brought in to the light-house overnight after washing up by the lighthouse, and Yuko witnessed him accidentally killing a student with his own axe- only she doesn't know it was an accident. She puts poison into Shuya's meal, and when one of her more excitable friends takes a bite from the dish, there is a delicious twenty seconds of near unbearable tension, as the girls continue conversing breezily as Yuko stares transfixed at her now doomed friend, shaking like a palm tree in the face of a hurricane. When the girl's mouth explodes in bloody vomit, what follows is a searingly brutal orgy of bullets and cries of anguish. Like Chigusa's screentime it is all over incredibly fast, and the explosions of jealousies hidden beneath the apparently cheery facade of the girl's clique are just as damaging as the bullets that pepper their bodies. It's so perfectly realised that you want to jump up and clap.
However, the rest of the film fails to live up these moments of brilliance. For one, the chosen protagonist -Nanahara- is a horribly uncharismatic, dull one. One never sympathises with Shuya's struggle to comprehend how his classmates can kill each other because there are more interesting characters to see and stories to tell. Also, the massive plot holes are too much to take- none of the kids have heard of the Battle Royale program, yet it opens in a (great) prologue of the last battle, in which the media scramble to transmit images of the latest winner -a tiny little girl, browned blood stuck stubbornly to her hair and face, still clutching a teddy bear like the tattered shreds of her innocence- to the public. Indeed, the film is clearly uninterested in how and why the Battle Royale law came about, leaving it to lazy subtitles at the beginning and a deeply unsatisfactory lecture from class teacher Kitano (played by the Japanese Tarantino, Takeshi Kitano, whose character is one note and whose screen presence is due solely to his bizarrely asymmetrical face). The ending is also not explained adequately and is deeply unsatisfactory. Also, the tagline of the film -""Could You Kill Your Best Friend?""- is never really considered, with the exception of pleasingly sparse subplot. At the beginning of the film, two girls cling to each other, wailing that they are best friends and will never harm each other. Later, when coquettish light-house girl Utsumi informs Shuya of the deaths that have occured while he has slept (as told to the students by speakers posted around the island), the camera trails solemnly over the bodies of two girls at the edge of the sea, both impaled with weapons, both clinging to a lifering. The audience is left to work out the rest.
Also, the film doesn't live up to it's 'blackly comic' reputation. The only satirical or deliberately comic element of the film is the instruction video shown to the kids before they are given their weapons. In it, a ridiculously hyper Japanese cutie with a nose piercing, dyed hair and body glitter, gurns into the camera and gleefully tells the kids the rules of how they must kill each other as if she is giving them casual fashion advice. You will laugh out loud when she pulls an axe from a bag, and gives it a double take, as if she has no idea how it got into her hands. ""Aaaaaaaaaah!"" she cries, ""This one is SUPER lucky!!!!""It's not just Shuya who disappoints as a main character. The afore-mentioned Kiriyama is by far the most popular character among the cultish ""Battle Royale"" fanbase- and yet it's hard to see why. He says not one word during the entire film, which is an utter action/B movie cliche, and feels like an excuse not to have to bother with more pesky characterisation in a film of forty plus key characters. All too often the character -who is not part of the class and has apparently ""signed up for fun"" is used to add momentum to the story when there is no obvious way of pushing it forward. We need to get a character somewhere? Have Kiriyama chase them! Equally, the other ""exchange student"", Kawada, has a hugely tedious subplot concerning his previous entry into a Battle Royale.But despite the inherent flaws of this concept -most notably occasionally shallow characterisation and a barrage of melodrama (which personally I don't feel in this case is a flaw)- ""Battle Royale"" is a vital film experience. Despite the dull, uninvolving angst of it's protagonist and weak ending, it's great moments are great enough to make it a must-see. However, ultimately, despite some thrilling aspects of genius, the film fails to live up to it's concept.",Battle Royale
361,kurai_hisui,"Bloody, yes, but far from mindless",9,24 November 2002,"Make no mistake; it is a gory film.  I'm not squeamish, and there were a few scenes that made me go 'ewwww!'.  On the other hand, it's _not_ a slasher flick, and it's definitely not mindless.  Given the number of characters, many of them are well developed, and the acting is top notch (They must have cast, and killed off, nearly every decent teen-actor in the country.  And the  scythe-wielding Kou Shibasaki was brilliant).  The pacing was perfect, I thought, matching the theme of the movie.  Things often turn violent suddenly, sometimes unexpectedly, but it doesn't feel totally random (and doesn't resort to that annoying 'shake the camera until the audience is nauseous' technique so popular in action films lately).  And considering the on-screen-death/screen-time ratio is about 1 per 3 minutes, it's amazing that they manage to pack in more character development than some dramas. The music and cinematography were very good, too, even if a couple of sets do look 'budget' (less so than in many Japanese films, though).It's no psychological drama, and far from subtle, visually or thematically, but defiantly thought provoking (as long as you're willing to stop and think about what's going on behind the violence).  It comes across as a heavy-handed ""Lord of the Flies,""... with uzis. As long as you don't get hung up on the (big) gouts of blood and hatchets to the head, there's a lot to get out of this film.  To be fair, if you have any experience with Japanese schools, you'll probably 'get' a lot more (like the importance of those cookies, or Kitano-sensei doing calisthenics alone), and I think one of the major points of BR is to criticize the Japanese education system (I _know_ teachers like that.  And students, for that matter...)  Still, considering the slightly perverse popularity of ""Survivor,"" I think there are a lot of interesting implications in BR. And in its own twisted way, it's a lot of fun, too.",Battle Royale
362,Conniption,"Insane, inspired gorefest",10,18 June 2003,"Set in the not-too-distant future, a class of 14 and 15 year olds get randomly selected to take part in the sadistic 'Battle Royale' game. Simply put, they have three days to butcher their classmates and be the last one standing. If there's more than one teenager standing after three days, the electronic collar that have been strapped around their necks will explode. Just to make things interesting, a couple of 'transfer students' are added to the class, one of whom has won a past winner of the tournament, while the other is a sadist who joined for fun. The kids each get a weapon - an Uzi if you're lucky, a pot lid if not.What makes this movie remarkable is the way it is played deadpan as an action drama, and make no mistake, this is action at its finest - pulsating, chaotic and gripping. However, the ludicrousness of the premise shines through to give the film a surreal vein of dark humour, which makes the vicious orgy of bloodletting on display bearable. The debriefing scene where the rules are explained to the students in particular is a fantastic piece of pitch-black comedy, as their teacher indulges in a bit of wish-fulfillment, murdering kids who whisper in class or talk back to him.This is a one-of-a-kind movie, which you'll either love or just not get. If you've got the stomach for dark humour and gore, it's well worth watching to find out if you're part of the first group.",Battle Royale
363,mauvais,The Soul of Japan (^o^)/,6,20 April 2004,"Most of the overseas criticism, as well as praise of this movie revolve around its merits as an action film, which I think is the wrong angle. This is not a great action film in spite of the low standards of the genre. That's not so much the point. In suggesting that this film is exceptional and endearing as a Japan- specific parody, I think I am supported by the fact that it has not had a significant international release (at least not in the US) in spite of its huge popularity at home, the provocative subject matter, and the presence of an international star.This movie is about school uniforms, club, homeroom teachers, school trips, perms (male and female), cute, cute boys and girls...and all of this is destroying itself against its will, forced to do so by the society that created it, punished for being too cute... It uses the language of the ultraviolent Asian action cinema, but it often feels more like hyperactive primetime Japanese television. The humor would certainly be right at home on Fuji TV, if they had a few more characters screaming passionately about tasty ramen amidst the slaughter.Then there is Beat Takeshi, perfectly cast as Everyone's homeroom teacher, the man whose resume includes 5 simultaneous regular television variety shows at any one time, juice commercials, car commercials, and films ranging from The Summer of Kikujiro to Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence or Taboo. This is what can be said about the film-making, if anything: that it effectively uses the pacing of television and constellations of popular culture to eliminate sympathy and attribute the abundant perversity. All the better for a film about Japan, where the media, including film, cross-fertilize more than anywhere else.",Battle Royale
364,PtownB5,"Great book, great movie",8,12 April 2005,"I usually have significant trouble with the adaptation of a great book into a movie- they miss elements that the reader may have found to be key- the emotional propulsion is lost, the motives are blurry, the poignance is compromised. Movies have a time limit, a book does not. However, given these constraints, I think Kinji Fukasaku did a really good job at maintaining the integral elements that make Battle Royale so fascinating. I think reading the book is pretty instrumental at fully grasping the concept that is delivered in this film. One one level, it is pretty basic- 42 classmates have 48 hours ( I think it is 3 days in the movie) to kill one another . They are dumped on an evacuated island, given a random supply of weaponry (could be a fork, could be a machine gun) and maps of the island which marks the rotation of the ""forbidden zones""- forcing movement, which forces interaction between the students. Only one can survive, or the metal collars they are equipped with will explode at the expiration date of the game. One another level, it raises a lot of philosophical questions about life and death, societies and politics - humanity in general. It is definitely a violent movie, and it is definitely absurd in some ways- but I don't see how we could see it any other way, the concept is so extreme. A government regime that forces 14 year old kids kill each other. However, it is the tension area between the violence and absurdity that is most compelling- Do we cease to see something as dark, ominous, wrong- because of our familiarity with it? Are questionable ethics or values cloaked in rules, hidden in smiles, lost in our inability to change it? What does our compliance mean, ultimately?I think the book deserves the kudos to raise these questions, and I think the movie does a great job at delivering these concepts with visual punch. The cast was great, they were all quite young- and they were phenomenal at capturing the fear, the hysteria, the calculations of these kids, and it is always cool to see Beat Takeshi in a film.",Battle Royale
365,filmtodeath,Captivating,9,31 May 2005,"This film is incredibly crafted. I've never seen something with such shocking material. The black humor, violence, music, the codes of honor and friendship, it's just hard to look away from the screen. Kinji Fukasaku was truly gifted and I am so happy he made this film before he died, it's a great way to end a career. I won't try to analyze the film or anything, but if you can stomach the gore etc., then you should definitely try to find a copy. If you like the film then go on and check out his earlier stuff, like the Yakuza Papers. It almost appears that he's been practicing his whole life and then went out with a bang making a film which broke every Japanese Box office record.",Battle Royale
366,Alex_Is_Legend,Modern classic finally receives proper U.S. release,8,21 March 2012,"Cultural differences can be astounding. As with most first world countries, the depiction of a child's death is widely considered taboo here in America. It's interesting, then, that Kinji Fukasaku's Battle Royale is celebrated as a major achievement in Japanese cinema. After all, it depicts dozens of teenagers brutally murdering one another. Not only did the movie receive critical acclaim, but it also became one of the 10 highest grossing films in Japan and went on to receive multiple awards at the 2001 Japanese Academy Awards.Battle Royale is not without its controversies, however. Its native Japan attempted to ban Koushun Takami's novel of the same name on which the movie is based when it came out in 1999 and tried to do the same to the film upon its release the following year. Neither attempt was successful, but other counties prevailed in blocking the release. Thanks to the Streisand effect, all of the contention merely gave the film free press.Contrary to popular belief, Battle Royale was never banned in the United States. However, a distribution agreement had never been reached. Various DVD incarnations of the film have been available in the past, the legality of which is questionable at best. Anchor Bay's new version, therefore, marks the first official North American release of the title.The release is well-timed. With the film adaptation of Suzanne Collins' similarly themed The Hunger Games hitting theaters just a few days later, the DVDs will be on new release endcaps while the subject matter is fresh on everyone's mind. And the comparison is not hidden; there is a quote atop the back cover from Entertainment Weekly that equates the two.Anchor Bay has provided viewers with a few options from which to chose. First, there is a bare-bones DVD or Blu-ray with the film and nothing else. More noteworthy, however, is the Battle Royale: The Complete Collection four-disc set, which features both the theatrical and extended cuts of the film, the 2003 sequel Battle Royale II and a disc of bonus material.The film presented on the standalone disc is dubbed the director's cut, although that's not exactly accurate. The extended cut features eight additional minutes of footage, including three ""requiems"" at the end, as well as various minor changes throughout the picture. Fukasaku reportedly preferred the original cut, but the alterations don't change the overall narrative experience too much (although many fans will argue this point).After experiencing the tragedies of September 11th and countless school shootings in the years following the film's release, Battle Royale is less shocking for its depiction of kids being slaughtered and more terrifying that such heinous acts could actually be committed. The film is not all melancholy, though; it is elegantly spun with dark humor and great action. And it's not just mindless violence for the sake of it; the film is an allegory for the cutthroat world of adulthood that awaits students after their schooling.In an alternate reality, the nation of Japan collapsed from unemployment in the year 2000. Amidst the chaos, hundreds of thousands of students boycotted school. As a result, the adults feared the youth and, in an attempt to quell them, passed the Millennium Educational Reform Act, also known as the Battle Royale Act.A class of 42 ninth graders who believe that they're going on field trip find themselves as the randomly chosen participants in the Battle Royale. As their teacher, Kitano (Takeshi Kitano), explains, it is a three-day battle to the death. Only the last student standing is allowed to go home. Everyone is equipped with a bag of survival items, including a random weapon - which can range from a submachine gun to a saucepan lid.At first, the students think it's a joke - but reality quickly sets in when the first teen is killed without hesitation. From there, it becomes and all-out war. One of the film's strengths is that it develops a large number of characters in a short amount of time. Given that they are high school students, many of the plot points are based on relationships and cliques. The viewer wants to see a number of them succeed, but the rules clearly dictate that there can only be one survivor.Battle Royale is a modern classic, not simply only for for the controversy that it caused, but because it is a great film. It's nice to see that the artistic merit has superseded the reputation. If you haven't given in and purchased an imported copy already, the movie is a must-own for any film fan.",Battle Royale
367,dylan-ransom,Yowsah!,8,27 January 2006,"This movie was cheesy and exploitative, with ridiculous logic and little character development. The laughable subtitled dialogue may have been lost in the translation, so that's excusable. Characters' motivations were paper thin, and there was simply not enough time to lay it out properly, leading to ridiculous interactions between almost everybody.Okay, now that is out of the way, I have to say I LOVED this film. The premise is courageous and exceedingly captivating. The young actors pull off their roles tremendously well, especially the principle characters.Highlights for me: The frightened and spastic ways that the children handled the weapons, i.e. missing 'easy' shots that scared kids would probably miss, too.The lighting/scenery. It set the mood perfectly. I'm no cinematographer, but I love movies like this that look beautiful and don't draw the mind away from the plot. Music was appropriate.I believed the relationship between the male/female leads. That sounds simple, but is very hard to achieve in this context.Several moments of subtle black humor that were not 'comic relief' as in most American suspense films.Did I mention the premise? It took balls to make this movie, period.As for the issue of a remake. Let Tarantino have a go at this one. But please, God, not Oliver Stone. I think an independently financed, reasonably-budgeted movie could happen. Who has the courage? Yeah, it will probably never happen.If I ran the circus........I suggest not doing a strict remake. I would cut down on the number of characters, probably in half, to enhance the characters. I would make it a long film, perhaps 2.5 hours, and do something the Japanese filmmaker didn't: Make it believable. Show these poor children as they descend into madness. Show the inner conflict more. Keep the ages of the kids the same, but find a couple very young-looking adults so that seduction can be used to it's full extent (you know which character I mean). It's an exploitation film, no doubt, so go ahead and show some skin, and throw in lots of stuff to make people cringe. And don't go overboard trying to make a social or political statement. It works just fine as a ""what if"" experiment.I don't condone remakes in most cases, but there are filmmakers who could do MUCH better that the awesome original.",Battle Royale
368,bronzeskye,A very dark comedy,8,19 September 2001,"I'll be honest - during the first 20 minutes of this movie I didn't have a clue what I was watching.  Upon watching the entire film I came to the conclusion that it takes about this long to get used to the film's horrific, dark sense of humour.  The elements of comedy are there from the start, with the ridiculous opening, introducing the 'Battle Royale' with film footage of the last battle and shots of the sole survivor, a little girl.In fact, by the time you've settled down you'll be having a ball.  This is an incredibly unique experience and it's great fun too.  Beat Takeshi manages to steal the show with a performance as wry as you would usually expect, despite not getting much screen time.The plot has some neat subplots and mini-twists with character backgrounds giving hints and red herrings on who is trustable in the group and who is willing to go all the way and kill the remaining children.If you don't have the stomach for violence and gore, then this certainly isn't for you, but if you can pick up on when the film is trying to be funny and over the top, you'll have a great time.",Battle Royale

The first half is like David Fincher's NATURAL BORN KILLERS, the second half is John Woo's THE THIN RED LINE.I do recommend the movie, the 2nd half isn't a total loss by any stretch and some of the film's best scenes occur there.  But the first half just flowed like great films do.  It wasn't just a bunch of great scenes, each great scene clicked right into the next one.  The second half is a collection of isolated moments of interest.  In fact, by that time the film's fantastic premise (of setting violent teens against each other) didn't feel the least bit shocking.

This, however, is not gore for gore's sake, but an emotional study of the real human beings subjected to this by the society they inhabit. It is by this society that the barriers each has built up are forced down. People are forced to kill or be killed. Some, cannot take this and take their own lives, others revel in it.On another level, Battle Royale is a poignant study of societies facination with violence and corruption of innocence. The students, in their flawless uniforms, are a perfect reputation of innocence - or at least, perceived innocence. The speed at which they are corrupted and forced to violence is dramatic, showing, as 'Lord Of The Flies' did, that society's boundaries aren't as high as we think they are.The film, for the most part, follows Nanahara Shuya's journey through this madness, in his battle to stay innocent, but to avoid dying. The fact that the end, he seems almost incorruptable, is a way for him to snub his nose at the organisation that put him in that situation and continue his life as he sees fit.Overall, an excellent film, extremely well acted. Dramatically directed. A must see.",Battle Royale
381,sanjes,This movie ROCKED!,8,13 February 2002,"For the most part, the film made me feel like I was watching all the best parts of Clockwork Orange, Robocop and Lord of the Flies at once with Dawn of the Dead kicked in to spice things up.  It starts to drag a bit at the end, but I highly recommend this as long as you aren't overtly sensitive to violence.  I don't know that it was all that thoughtful as others seem to think, but man oh man was it entertaining!  Plenty of other reviewers have covered the plot details.  Suffice to say, I don't see any standard American distributors picking this one up for quite some time.  I tracked down a Region 3 print of this, and was really glad I did!",Battle Royale
382,Bmoviescanbefun,A true masterpiece,10,23 June 2003,"I have now  watched this film 2 times and each time i was amazed. It is not often that I have friends who watch a film with me that has subtitles but this one breaks that mold. I first heard of the film in a gaming magazine, I felt I had to see it, my only complaint is i'm sure some things our lost in the translation, I do hope that an dubbed copy will be available. I doubt that it will be ripped off here in the states and if it is im sure they will water it down and have it be a college student movie. I give this film my highest recommendation",Battle Royale
383,RastaPiggy,"Amusing, crazy, brilliant",8,1 May 2003,"A class of 42 students were picked out of all 3rd grade classes in Japan to fight till death  till only 1 survives. The class itself thinks they are going for school trip... guess again.  The kids have to kill each other until 1 survives. If there is more than 1 left after 3  days.. everyone will die. This movie is quite unique. I have never seen anything like it. It is obvious no-one would  ever think of making this in Hollywood, because the violence is extreme and graphic.  The entire movie is was pondering about who would finally survive all of this. I give this movie a 8/10",Battle Royale
384,souldog,Superior Film,10,17 June 2003,"""Battle Royale"" is one of the most violent and disturbing movies ever made, and oddly enough, it is alo one of the best.  Playing as part-reality parody and part-social commentary, the film is never anything less than involing and gripping from the first frame.A group of students are taken to a remote island to play a game of Battle Royale, in which they are forced to turn on one another, hunt and kill each other... until only one is left.Known worldwide for its high level of violence among young teen characters (and not officially released in the United States for this very reason), ""Battle Royale"" is like no other film.  It is at times suspenseful, action-packed, heartwarming, cold-blooded and sympathetic.
Is it the perfect movie -- no.  It does have some slow spots and some trouble areas.  But this is gutsy filmmaking, and a movie that you can both stare in awe at the violence while applaud the motives behind the film.
""Battle Royale II"" is due out in the summer of 2003.",Battle Royale
385,Lilithia,GENIUS!,10,16 December 2004,"This movie is freakin' genius! This is coming from a crazy-obsessed fan!What a better way to spark an interest in such things by using teenagers? The movie has a combination of your typical teenage/student relationships - rivals, jealous, love BUT also throws in the parts of the game, & death of the people you grew up with - your classmates.I personally believe Battle Royale is the BEST movie in the world. Just... some people don't realise this yet.Great acting, great plot line, great story line...hey & it even inspired Kill Bill! How could you NOT like it? I love it.",Battle Royale
386,patrickcantstop,A must see!!!,10,31 March 2013,"Wow. Battle Royale really is a film worth watching. Every aspect of this film is just breathtaking. I've read the novel, and I don't really mind the deviations because both the novel and the book are just splendid. Despite the fact that most actors in the movie were young (and it was probably their first time acting), all of them did great. The pacing was also just right; it was fast enough for a thriller and there were little or no boring segments; at the same, most of the characters were given enough screen time so you could get a glimpse of their lives and not just see them as plainly as a protagonist or an antagonist, or a main character or an extra .Could you kill your own best friend? Will you take or will you be taken? These were just some of the questions that ran through my mind while I was watching the film. Just the thought of doing all those things these kids did in the movie really is terrifying. However, at the same time, we are forced to reflect and re-evaluate our own selves and our society. Beyond all the violence and gore lies a deeper meaning. In our own way, aren't we all participating in a Battle Royale as we live our lives each day? Aren't we all forced to live in a dog-eat-dog world?I can understand why this hasn't enjoyed much mainstream success. Much of the world isn't ready for an eye-opener as brutal and as violent as this movie. However, it must be pointed out that the violence and the gore were not done just tastelessly to entertain; it was meant to get us thinking. This film is not just about generating controversies; it really has substance and I can even consider it as a work of art. I really am grateful for having an opportunity to watch a masterpiece of Japanese Cinema. 10/10 it is!",Battle Royale
387,chirpyfeminist,Average legalized snuff featuring teenage corpses and chimp-porn,1,27 March 2014,"Meaningless fantasy island slash, blood splatter on uniforms, run, chilling screams, splatter, blood, young corpses piling up. Miraculous survival of the divinely chosen few also equally meaningless...The Japanese must be laughing at the Americans who take this run-of-the-mill juvenile slasher snuff SO seriously. The intellectual spin and deification of BR here is SO earnest. So cute...This cartoon teen snuff material should appeal to those who get high on:Very scared children in school uniform being prey upon, hiding and running for their lives Blood shooting from freshly dismembered body parts, blood-soak school uniforms Horrifying cries of helpless teenage girls in cute school uniform skirtsHysterical teenage male hormone explosion - sudden high energy psychopathic outburst which ends in gruesome murdering of fellow classmatesKids betraying kids even their love interests, the cheapness of loveDead disfigured children corpses lying motionless in blood pond Personally, I'd rather watch people swallow snake alive. It's far less nauseating, and has some edutaining value.Agreed - the Japanese are less hypocritical when it comes to 'who gets to die or live', unlike in The Hunger Games. The BR story god is seemingly ""democratic"" in his hate for all. But make no mistake, he too had a favorite ""type"", his Katniss. BR has a lesson for young female viewers on 'how to behave with boys if you want to live in this evil violent world'. Yawn...is my response to his deafening hint.Snuff films like this could be a bore, or insulting, or cathartic, or appetite-whetting. But high-minded, it is not. At best this resonates with the hyper-competitive, unforgiving Darwinian school exams and winner-takes-all employment market. Nothing romantic or complicated.The passion shown here is far more interesting. Apparently this movie 'makes them think deeply' of such 'exciting' things, like 'what if their love interest is told to kill them or die'. It reflects a contemporary reality in which many human beings still harbor chimp-like aggression and blood-lust, who would jump at any excuse for hunting and murdering anyone, in the next cubicle, in bed next to them, or in a school yard nearby.Watching children including girls kill one another, would of course make the inner chimp feel better. If cute girls or young little brothers behave violent and evil too, then it's free game for all, as the physically-smaller always lose. Yeepee... Who would do such a thing, taking it out on weaker smaller school kids anyway? Bully-murders don't happen in real life, right?By all means lust on. Snuff On Minors is the new political correctness. But just face up to one's inner chimp already and stop trying to elevate it to some intellectual pedestal. It's annoying, and really, really stupid. Or is it chimp-ish.",Battle Royale

It is definitely worth watching and it will make you keep watching because each time you will notice some thing knew and make you look at it in a different way and it may take you some time to work out the ending which is quite fun (although i cheated and looked on the internet :P).

390,la_fleur,A tribalization of death and youth. What an alternative reality film must not look like.,4,10 May 2009,"I have to say that alternative reality films are definitely my favorite film genre. Blindness (2008) and Children of Men (2006) are without any doubt two genre masterpieces, including also elements of science fiction.The whole idea surrounding the film was arousing: The government has failed to control increasing violence and indiscipline in schools, combined with a growing economic crisis, pretty much like nowadays. Even the idea of making and island (just like ""Blindness"") to perform this extreme measure of control of adolescents is immoral but told as a story is respectable. The film starts really good, but the whole thing sadly changed when the first school boy killed one of his classmates.People tend to show this film as a deformation of Japanese culture, or even a critic of Japanese double moral. Well, I'm pretty sure that this has nothing to do with Japanese youth, I know for certain this because I traveled several times there.I have to reject this absurd line of argument showing teens as potential assassins whose biggest problems are crushes and gossips between them, becoming even more unreal when you are facing such a disturbing situation like encountering the death of your fellow classmates.In every alternative reality film there is a thin line: the plot has to be always plausible. If you cross this line, like happened here the moment the boy killed the other, an alternate reality becomes a comedy, like Monty Python.But the problem here is that there is no satire or comedy, it's just a bunch of teens killing each other without any logical reason. I'm pretty annoyed because the idea or the background was great. The only problem was the thing of killing each other. You can explore other possibilities like a group trying to build a boat or a refugee camp (like ""Lost""), even if they risk their life's with the collar bomb (like ""Saw"", a group of teens killing the military and disguising as them; the serial killer / predator idea: you know who has died but you never know the one that is killing each other (""Identity""); a group confident suicide while they discuss a form of protest against this law, fighting the inevitable death (""Cube""). Blindness again is a really good example of how this film should have been. The possibilities are endless.The extremist idea of killing each other is absolutely surreal. A lot of films explore this idea: when other humans kill other humans the person has to disrupt his own human nature. Specially when these humans are teenagers.In concussion, the trivialization of death, youth and coming of age that this film does is disgusting. 4 out of 10",Battle Royale
391,MinionWench,Like Marmite. Love it. Hate it. But realise there's more to this than gore.,10,1 February 2006,"I've tried to look into both sides of the argument. Those on IMDb who loved it, and those who hated it and feel they are doing people a favour by warning them away.Do yourself a favour and just see it. Stomach the gore, the bore if you feel that, and just see someones interpretation of the dark side of human nature.I am the same age now (01/06) as the students are in this film, and I can imagine no more horrific scenario than the one they find themselves in. In a nutshell, 40 students (a whole class) are chosen by a 'lottery' to participate in Battle Royale (which even appears to be treated with the same media attention as Big Brother). Told they're going on a school trip they get on a coach, get gassed en route, and wake up on an island to come face to face with their old teacher (who they harassed, and even stabbed) who cheerfully welcomes them to Battle Royale and a waking nightmare.Could you kill your best friend? Even if you'd all die if one person wasn't left standing after three days? Some people question the believability of the 'BR Act'. Quite frankly, how can you not believe in it? Even not knowing the state of children in Japan I know that in England we have such yobs it's a wonder no one has suggested our own BR Act yet.As for the acting, OK, there are wooden moments (maybe it's even due to poor subtitles... i always feel sorry that I haven't grasped Japanese when i see these films) and the number of 'deathbed confessions' as i called them is enough to make it worthy of a drinking game. The teacher Kitano is a joy to watch (even if my favourite character has to be the 'benki-girl presenter' on the Battle Royale introduction video) Another criticism i saw was the use of classical music at certain points. What's the point? People ask. Here's the point, i say.It's unnerving. Here's a class of hysterical, terrified, teenagers being faced with a) the demand to kill each other and b)a teacher who is, quite frankly, nuts. There is no hope in hell of reasoning with him. I feel the music fits with this. What else suggests insanity but giving off the list of the mornings dead to some Chopin number, or a waltz? The kids are forced to show their true colours, political statements aside this is all about humans. We get paranoid. We turn on each other, every man for himself. Some fight, some hide. Friends turn on each other. Cliques fall apart. It makes for both gripping, exciting, enjoyable and horrifying watching. You question why you want to watch it but you can't stop. And you can't help but think...What would I do? And then after I went into school and looked at the students around me.Perhaps it was more frightening to dwell on what would they do...",Battle Royale
392,geniusshikamaru,Why it's considered to be so great,10,27 February 2006,"I've asked around in person, at school, on forums, on chats, and to my personal friends: Have you seen or heard of Battle Royale? The majority say the have heard of it. But what makes this so popular? It's not that it is a satire. Or that it's a Japanese movie and they are fans of Japanese culture(anime and stuff). It is because of the basic idea: a class of 9th graders taken and forced to kill each other in an evacuated island.In other comments it describes it as not fulfilling the satire end of the plot. That is because this movies main plot is drastically different than the original book. The movie has the basis being out of control wild teenagers and children. The adults are mad so they pass an act to make them kill each other and scare them straight. This pretty much destroys the reason why it's a satire of growing up, like how it is in the book. In the book it is a Japan in which there is a Dictatorship similar to that of a communist or Nazi country. And for the sake of instilling good survival tactics for their military they have the BR program. In the book each student has their own small sub plot of the troubles or leisures of their lives and how it's hard being a youth in japan's society.Besides those differences the movie does a fairly well job of keeping the story in place. Plenty of action all through out the movie. Fans of action movies will be happy with this movie very much. Although the ending is quite odd and different than the book it fits in order for the sequel.Not comparing it to the book. And as a stand alone movie. It has fairly interesting plot and with enough action you wont be bored. I suggest both reading it and watching Battle Royale.",Battle Royale
393,Cormorant,Avoid this film if you have cared for a Japanese,1,24 February 2006,"I strongly recommend that if you have ever cared for a Japanese person or had a close Japanese friend, that you do NOT watch this film.Everyone knows that Japanese society has youth problems, so does the U.S. , Australia, Germany etc. But this film could best be described as ""Let's see the Columbine Massacre up close and personal for 110 minutes! More MORE. Yay!"" Ugh. ;( ;( ;( The blurb on the DVD back talks of ""a parody on 'Survivor Island' type shows"" etc. That is IMO garbage.The short background story and logical framework for setting up the death island by law ""where c42 go in and only 1 comes out alive"" just don't hold water, let alone buckets of blood. It achieves nothing useful. Perhaps this adds a surrealist element. Possibly too much was lost from the book - but it adds nothing to the film. I'm personally sorry I watched Battle Royale at all, and I have watched ""Men Behind the Sun"" - with sadness at the worst atrocities war has ever known - but that was a very important documentary about something very few know much about.The reduction of modern society to a ""King Rat Rules"" social Darwinism MAY be seen as a some redeeming commentary on this film, but the forced abuse of c14 year old school children in this film just made me feel sick and severely depressed.I've also read and seen Lord of the Flies, but the comparison in terms of feeling is like one bee sting vs being covered with killer bees.",Battle Royale

Sadly, the second one was true.Battle Royale was a brilliant concept, only so poorly written it hurt. People who give this a good rating clearly don't care about good cinema, but only cool action and violence. This had some extremely intense, violent, but always predictable scenes in it, which was extremely disappointing.My advice for you is to definitely watch this movie, because it does have some extremely great moments, but also to not judge it on its ""sweetness,"" but on it's merit as a movie. It is entertaining, but not at all good.-H",Battle Royale

It has plenty of youthful violence and it is even with the gruesomeness towards the females as males. Did you ever notice, women in horror/action never seem to get is as bad as the males. Good stuff!",Battle Royale
396,Stupid-7,"A film that the US, would never, could never make...",9,15 September 2001,"This film is film that I believed had to be made, and it was only a matter of time before it was.  Yet it was a film that the US mainstream could never have conceived making.Firstly to get it out of the way I will say that I loved this movie, although at no point did I feel comfortable while watching it.  It had the power and emotional content, that while not necessarily apparent in the dialogue was visible on screen at all times.I am truly glad that this film has come out of mainstream Japanese cinema. It would have only been made in the US by independent film-makers who would have basked in the glory of its controversy and felt oh-so-smug that they had created it, while shoving a moral in your face.  While I actually have no problem with US Indie film I do feel that a Western background would have comprised on visceral content, and upped the content of cheap moral points.For those who say the violence was ""cartoon-style"" and laughable must have been watching a different film.  Whilst this film is heavy in black humour I can clearly say that the deaths are shocking in the extreme, and there is no relenting from the beginning to the end.  Only occasionally does the camera pan away from the final deed.  The only deaths that have a dark humour content to them, are those involving Kitano (Beat Takeshi) and the ""lone"" vigilante (those who have seen the film will know what I am talking about). Other sections, such as the ""Training Video"" are equally comedic, and absurd.  Yet other deaths are shocking in the extreme, and show how the slightest suspicion can have disastrous consequences for groups that only have trust to keep them together, a truly shocking scene in the Lighthouse reinforces this.The fact that this film employs Children as the main protagonists of the story is the key to the whole impact of the film.  We have all seen films like The Running Man where adults fight adults for survival and it seems that much less shocking, albeit that film was handled in a completely different manner.  Children have the innocence that makes the brutality of this film that much more shocking, adults in the same situation would have had the reaction from audiences of cheering at the screen as the hero dispatches yet another victim.  This could never and would never have been the case with this film.To another commentator who felt that this film sticks with you less than Scream, I simply fail to find this to be anywhere close to the truth.  The deaths in Scream although bloody are nothing but pastiche of those films that Scream is mimicking, ultimately throwaway deaths that up in brutality in order to out-do the last one that have one or two psychotic perpetrators, who eventually get their comeuppance.  In this film their are no victims and besides one exception there are no villains amongst the children.  They simply HAVE to play the game or die.Well I encourage all those who feel they can stomach it to go and see this film or find it available somewhere (as I believe it has been banned in the US).  It is not truly a film denouncing the evils of Reality TV or showing us the future of that trend of Broadcasting, that is merely a plot device to place the children in this situation.  The nature of the film lies in its deconstruction of Friendships, Trust and our views on Innocence.  Go and see it not as a spectator of this BR spectacle but as one of the participants and remember what was important to you when you were at school, and whether any of those rivalries, hatreds and friendships would have been enough for you to decide who deserves to die and who deserves to live.",Battle Royale
397,Frin,The Book versus The Film,7,6 May 2004,"The first time I saw Battle Royale I watched it in two sittings and it didn't immediately grab me; I watched it again with a friend, she loved it right away and on second viewing so did I.The reason the film works is because it's very funny and lighthearted along with the shock factor and making some good points.  The score is perfectly selected/composed, and the choral theme playing a few times is beautiful and melancholy. There *are* a few moments that go ""too far"", but it all adds together to make a delicious darkly-comic treat.The hilariously peppy video presenter is a definite highlight.Something that doesn't really hit home in the film (as it's not the case) but does in the book is the frequency in which the BR Act is carried out - week-in, week-out. The government is murdering approximately 2,132 kids a year, and their parents/guardians if they resist - the winner might not have a family to go back home to.It's ironic that the BR Act is designed to control wayward youth - but it's only those who are well-behaved enough to drag themselves to school who are subject to it!  Goodness knows how truants behave!I'm pretending this is *it* though, I'm pretending the sequel didn't happen; but that doesn't stop me from recommending the original: 9/10",Battle Royale

Do not get me wrong. This movie has its moments. It has a rawness that is very rare these days. However, I really failed to see how this films warrants the rating it has on this site. The acting, for the most part, is acceptable. The actors did not appear to me to be as young as we were lead to believe by the grade they are in. The gore is fairly benign and does nothing to advance the genre. This film is not a gross out shocker, like Cannibal Holocaust. It felt like a ""wanna-be grade school"" Session 7 without the black humor.Overall, it rates a 6/10. I would see it, but there are way more important films to see than this.",Battle Royale
399,kfd,An impressive film.,8,26 September 2001,"***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** The advance publicity (in the UK at least) led me to think that `Battle Royale' was going to be very dark, very bloody satire, but not much more. I also thought that the premise was that the ""game"" is some sort of `Survivor'-type Reality show pushed to the Nth degree.Neither of these things are really true, I'm glad to say. That's not to say that the film is NOT very dark (it is!) or that it is NOT a very bloody satire (it's that as well, at times) but it becomes much more than that.It struck me that the ""Battle"" is invented and enacted not as a sick, `Rollerball'-style TV-game but as a device to try and scare the younger generation into behaving `properly'. Things have broken down, both economically and generationally, so the ""Battle"" serves as a warning to kids who won't `toe the line'. Respect your elders and parents or risk the consequences!I shan't rehash the plot at length - it's simple enough. A class of 15 (?) year-olds is selected at random, dropped on an island, told that they have to kill each other until one survives or all die after 3 days.
Yes, it does start out as a slash-fest with dollops of black humour (the `initiation' video is very funny) but gradually develops a much more sombre and thoughtful tone. Some kids refuse to `play' choosing either suicide or to gang together. Others seek escape. Some do try and `win'. All the fears, the embarassment, the awkwardness of that age are beautifully handled. The various fates of the participants become less `amusing' (in that flip modern Tarantino-esque way) and more moving (cf. the boy who seeks to protect a girl he's never had the courage to talk to in school). The acting's uniformly excellent.If you do get the chance check it out. It's deeper and better than most critics and commentators would have you believe.

400,smith_sj,How would you deal with escalating teenage violence..?,10,23 March 2002,With real life violence escalating to unacceptable levels how would you deal with the problem. Well the Japanese have foreseen the future and it is called Battle Royale. To teach each generation a lesson one class of schoolchildren are whisked away to a desert island and forced to fight to the last person standing. The concept is a bit like Running Man but in this instance all the participants kill each other. The game lasts for 3 days and if there is more than 1 contestant left alive at the end then everyone dies!! The film skips along nicely with a counter which tells you how many are killed and how many to go.Of course if we ever go down this route it would be better have a selection of convicts put on an island to fight to the death....oh and yes we need to televise it!!,Battle Royale
401,anandserpi,metaphor,9,8 November 2004,"Most of my friend dislikes the movie because there's too much violence and there's no way in million years that any government would do such a thing to their kids. It's just too gory and illogical, they say. Well, if you look at it that way, then I don't blame you. But if you look at it in a different way, like I do and many of you who really likes the movie, then I'll bet you would think that this is an excellent, groundbreaking movie.The whole movie is a metaphor. That's it. A metaphor of what? Well, it can be anything, depends on your backgrounds. And that's why the movie is very intelligent. Anybody ever read ""The Long Walk"" by Stephen King? It's about a bunch of teenage kids who have to walk until there's only one winner, or, like Battle Royale, one survivor. Somehow there are similarities between the novel and the movie. Both of them do not make any sense unless you look at it as a metaphor. Battle Royale is banned in several countries because of the graphic violence by children. But to me, Battle Royale is one of the most anti-violence movie there is. It's a movie that ""slaps"" people on the face. And I like to be ""slapped"" by a movie. Don't anyone?",Battle Royale
402,cyberjunglist,a metaphor for the immoral sacrifice of a nations youth in wartime?,10,8 July 2006,"the real beauty of this film is that it has so many parallels with our own personal experiences. Anyone who has suffered the loss of a loved one could associate with 'shuya' who loses both parents before having to watch his best friend killed in front of him (in my opinion one of the most nerve-racking and emotive scenes in the film). Any one who has felt outcast from society at some point could empathise with Norioko who was bullied and tormented at school by the very people now trying to kill her.There are also very complex questions being asked and answered amongst the supporting cast, how would you cope with being forced to murder someone to survive? some noble characters commit suicide near the start, others attempt to make peace or fight those in control. Yet some characters use the island as an excuse to live out fantasies or exact revenge, all the while the two main characters are going to desperate lengths merely to stay alive. The similarities with 'lord of the flies' should not be dismissed lightly (written after the second world war, a group of stranded children eventually form two rival communities, intended to suggest that war was human nature), although in 'battle royal' it is the adults who have created an accelerated situation which forces the confrontation. Beat Takeshi's character,from my perspective, portrays the sage-like king of Japan (in his mind, maybe even god), sacrificing a few kids to save the nation from chaos. An undertaking comparable to the sacrifice of soldiers abroad to gain peace at home.I view Battle Royal as a metaphor for the sacrifice of a nations youth in wartime, hence the military exercises Takeshi performs near the end.",Battle Royale

While the aforementioned maroon assassins and criminals on the island, Battle Royale sees school children unwillingly thrust into a situation of betrayal, fear and imminent doom. It is only through the medium of innocence that the audience can fully realise the horror of BR.I guarantee you at least one hunter flashback (a revision of playground tag). Who's in (the game as players) and who can you trust? My only advice is to pay attention to names, (it makes the movie that much more poignant) my only qualm is that BR is at times melodramatic and my only strategy for hunter: grab your best mate; run from anyone else.",Battle Royale

The government, from an act of sheer desperation, passes the Battle Royale Act - where a select class of students is moved to a desert island, given weapons and certain survival necessities, and ordered to kill each other before three days are up or be killed.Unrealistic maybe, but the idea alone is enough to make even the most sceptical of critics pay closer attention. And as another user commented, one of the most gripping factors is that this involves children and teenagers. Through this, this movie serves two potential roles - a bonus for those who don't necessarily like children or teens and sees the massacre of them as being an instant box office hit, or a shocking blow to the stomach when you realise that this isn't the average man vs. man movie.The acting was superb. There were some familiar faces - one being Chiaki Kuriyama, who plays Girl #13 Chigusa but is more well-known for her role as Gogo Yubari in ""Kill Bill"". The lead, Shuya Nanahara, started out as almost being the typical ""strong, quiet loner with a painful background"" but when thrust into the Battle Royale act, quickly became a more emotionally deep and likable character.Characters who stood out remained strongly present throughout the movie. Kuninobu, although he died fairly quickly, died in such a way and lived on in Shuya's eyes that his memory stays with you even after seeing the film. I was so pulled in by his death scene I almost felt as though I were standing amongst the students, watching his friends shove him away because of the inevitable explosion from his 'collar'. While you want to hate his friends for behaving in such a way, you realise that if they didn't, there would be no movie, because what this movie is really about is base human nature at its best (or should I say, worst?). The whole point of the Battle Royale act is that people are so scared for their own lives and the collars they wear that they are willing to kill even their best friends for a chance at survival.The character who made the movie for me, however, was Kiriyama. Perhaps it was because he looked mysterious or his hair reminded me a bit of Drop Dead Fred, either way it went, whenever he was in a scene my eyes were glued to him. Not because he was attractive either (though he is). Masanobu Ando plays a very charismatic psychotic villain.Through Shuya, Kinji Fukasaku has created a Frodo Baggins - someone unusually pure among all the rest despite everything. Shuya, while no saint, has the strength of mind to be repulsed by the Act, by the thought of killing his fellow classmates, and has the strength to push on in hope of finding a way to escape. Similarly, Sugimura is portrayed with a more heroic light than most - risking himself so that he can find his lady friends and in the end, even when a classmate shot him just to save herself, he doesn't mind because he wanted to save her - because he loved her.In the grey scale, there are characters like Mimura and Utsumi, who are trying to make lemonade out of lemons. While both meet unfortunate ends, they - along with other peace-calling characters - represent a hope that balances out the sheer brute force of the other kids and their wills to survive. Even their teacher, Kitano, is in the grey scale. You want to hate him for all he is doing, but he unfolds to be a lonely, defeated man whose bitterness got the best of him.Mitsuko and Kiriyama are the dark side of the spectrum. They caused some of the best action scenes (you should tally up Kiriyama's kills - I think he pretty much took out a large quantity of the kids on the island on his own, and his scene versus Mitsuko - while short - was climactic and satisfying).All of these characters bring together a story that is by no means perfect, but also by no means un-enjoyable. My only criticisms of this film lie in the beginning and the end. At the beginning, it shows a previous Battle Royale winner. Be it my misunderstanding or not, I didn't realise this was a previous winner and expected some mixed-around Pulp Fiction time-line where we start at the end and then proceed through the girl's time on the island. But hers was a separate story altogether, which confused me right until the end of the film! And as for the ending - Shuya and Noriko's fate was truly...disappointing. I haven't seen Battle Royale 2 and maybe it will make up for it. But their return to populated land as criminals and having to hide after everything left me with a sour taste in my mouth.These are the only reasons I haven't given this movie 10 stars. Some moments which others have considered absurd aren't so absurd when you think about it. For example, the annoying training video girl. Comedic, maybe, but doesn't she remind anyone else of an exaggerated caricature of the face politicians and leaders put up? She represents the government when it comes to the Battle Royale Act and to them, it is basically a game with an annoying game show host-like presenter.I would definitely recommend this movie, though perhaps not to the faint hearted. While I have heard criticism over the action scenes, some are extreme and a bit shocking (Kuninobu, for example). 9/10",Battle Royale
405,bd13imdb,Pleasant surprise,9,21 June 2002,"After hearing quite a lot about this movie I was very curious when it got out on video (last Tuesday) and generally intrigued by the concept. After watching the first half hour of the movie I really, really, really HATED it. I thought it was needlessly sadistic and the characters where all cardboard. After that first half an hour (when there were fewer characters to worry about) the plot thickened and the characters were more evolved than in the first half hour. Seeing the movie made me wonder  What would I do? I'm sure that if you finish the movie you will start to wonder yourself...",Battle Royale
406,the hedgehog from hell,It's probably not possible to watch this film without your mouth hanging open,8,22 January 2002,"The story of 42 students set loose on an island, with a variety of weapons and equipment (ranging from the lethal to the useless), with the sole purpose of killing each other is not going to be considered by anyone an easy ride.It may seem impossible to have this number of characters and make them distinctive, and indeed many of them are despatched before they can make an impression.  This is perhaps why the device of their names (and numbers) flashing up on the screen as they're killed is so disturbing - on one hand, it reminds you that each one is a life that has just been ended.  On the other hand, it resembles nothing so much as a shoot-em-up video game.The different attitudes taken by the students is well-thought out.  Many are reluctant to suddenly start killing - indeed, some kill themselves (""I'm not going to play this game"") before they have to face the basic choice of kill or be killed.  Some are pragmatic (and incompetent) and launch themselves into the slaughter, mostly to meet early deaths themselves.  Some form fragile alliances based on their cliques and friendships.  A few effortlessly switch to maniacal killing mode as if it was nothing.All the characters, although many of them are very lightly sketched, are well-known types - you'll watch this film and recognise some people you yourself were at school with.  This is perhaps the most horrifying aspect of the film.The violence and the gore are strong, but no worse than your average Hollywood flick.  Sometimes it seems almost as though the audience is being invited to revel in the carnage, but the truly brave aspect of this film is that it will suck in the violence-happy no-brainer audience with the prospect of schoolkids killing each other, and damn well make them use their brains for once.  How would you cope?  Would you kill or be killed?Battle Royale is well worth seeing, though, because it will disgust you, horrify you, repulse you, involve you, and even make you laugh in places. But it will also make you think.Lastly, I have to wonder if the fact that there were 42 students to start with was a sly nod to Douglas Adams' Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy?  I hope not, because if this is the meaning of Life, the Universe and Everything, then we're all doomed.",Battle Royale

409,ovidemeertens,astonishing,10,2 September 2002,"This movie is really astonishing. It's really unbelievably different, extremely violent and above all surrealistic. This is not a movie for viewers that are easily disturbed by violent movies. If you like new and different movies and if you can put surrealistic violent scripts in perspective, than this a must see movie.

410,north_star22,Awesome,10,13 January 2002,"A new law has been passed in the not too distant future of Japan that allows groups of delinquent high school children to be kidnapped and forced to compete in a Battle Royale where the last person alive is allowed to leave and rejoin society.  They put on a deserted island and all given random weapons.  Also they have tracking devices around their necks that, if a competitor walks into the wrong area, will explode.  This film boasts a most interesting concept that has had Japan and the whole world up in arms. Its been banned in 12 countries and tagged with a strong category III rating in Japan.  But the film is FAR from all gore as the concepts, thoughts and ideals of the characters are brought out in a very artistic manner thanks to great directing from Fukasaku Kinji.[9.5\10]",Battle Royale
411,mrandocalrissian,Almost perfect yet so often misunderstood,9,21 March 2012,"A lot of the criticism Battle Royale receives, specifically about its premise and the violence of some scenes, is entirely justified. One cannot get around this fact. However, for the viewer who is willing to throw a discerning eye over the film and consider WHY the story exists as it does, Battle Royale offers a surprisingly deep experience with morals that are strongly pertinent to modern-day society (and I don't just mean Japanese society).This film is not just about killing or blood-lust, as the common flashback scenes and epitaph screens prove; it is about an increasingly disenfranchised and disillusioned youth struggling to find their place in a world designed by and for the generations of their parents. It is about these older generations responding with fear to change, about them obsessing with the more negative stigma of youth; of failing to address WHY their children are acting as they are, and instead trying to ease their fears by imposing draconian laws and systems in order to fortify the status quo.It cannot be ignored that, though the film centres around a classroom of children murdering each other, the villain is the adult of the piece, played admirably (as one always expects) by Beat Kitano. The victim of a (somewhat accidental) assault, his reaction is over-the-top and callous. We should then not be surprised how, once empowered and armed, literally, the more dissident or angry or scared pupils act out violently (e.g. Mitsuko's death, followed by on-screen dialogue of what may be taken for her last words: ""I just didn't want to be a loser anymore""). Other characters just give-up, analogous perhaps of those youth - we all know some - who are so ill-prepared and outrun by life that they lose all motivation.The only exception is Kuriyama, the mysterious and bloodthirsty villain of the children. His motives are not established...but he is just one, and as in real life, an entire generation should not be judged based on the actions of one person.Of course, most people will choose not to think so deeply on the moral of the story. That is fine. There is a lot to enjoy at a more shallow level; the acting is generally flawless, the soundtrack is excellent (especially if you like classical music), and there is plenty of story to keep anyone engaged. I would suppose that if you had any strong objections to on-screen violence then you'd probably avoid it anyway.",Battle Royale
412,Witty_Kibitzer,Watch it!!! Unless you are sensitive.,8,11 March 2008,"Battle Royale was easily one of the more unique plots for a movie that I have ever watched unfold. It takes place in a time where unemployment is at an all-time high, Japan is chaotic, and the young and old are at odds with each other. In an attempt to regain some power over the youth, the adult population implements the BR Act, which allows them to randomly choose a class of students (in the film's case, a grade nine class) and take them to an island where they are forced to kill off all the other children, or be killed themselves at the end of the 3 days allotted. While this was not my usual sort of pick for a film, I found it to be pretty amazing. It was raw and (surprisingly) full of convincing acting. There were gorgeous shots of the land and very effective shots of the children experiencing the anguish that comes when they start to panic and fight for their lives. I was sure that a plot like this would be upsetting to me as it developed, but I felt like it was just personable enough that you care slightly about these people, but it didn't evoke the kind of emotion that tugs at your heart every time a character dies. I think this may have been intentional, the point was to look at the big picture and the social commentary involved. There were, however, a few scenes meant to illuminate the more personal sides of some of the students, but they fell short of captivating and didn't do much to move me.In the end, this film made me think. Usually this is what satiates me in my movie watching endeavors, so I can say I really enjoyed this film. I'm sure some would watch it purely for the gore, others for the fight scenes or purely for the chaos. I watch movies because they make me feel something and make me ponder their meaning long after I watch them. Whatever the reason, I'd recommend people give it a watch.",Battle Royale

415,Dccarter123,I liked it.,7,1 May 2014,"I really enjoyed this film. I found it suspenseful, and I found the characters interesting (at least the ones that the film focused on). However, the two film assassins, or the students who were actually enjoying it, were the characters that made the film. The main characters were also interesting. Especially a young man named Kowada, who actually won the Battle Royale in the past. I also particularly enjoyed the last ten minutes of the film. I also really liked the heavy violence throughout the film. In a film that is mainly about people being killed, the violence allows the film to have a unique style, and, without the violence, the film would have felt fairly bland. Despite my praise, I do have one issue with the film, and this is the fact that the film, in my opinion, tries to become more than just a film about killing people but ends up falling short. There are several scenes in the film that dive into what the characters are thinking, as well as many flashbacks. I thought towards the beginning that this film was going to be a social commentary of sorts about the human condition. However, it simply continued to be a film about survival. Now let me say that I would have been fine with a film about survival, if that was all that the film presented. However, I feel like the film was attempting to be more, and it fell short. With that being said, I still enjoyed the film. I found it to be exciting and simply a fun time watching a movie. If violence isn't your cup of tea, then I would avoid this film. However, if you have no issue with violence, then you will have a great time with this movie, especially if you enjoy Quentin Tarantino films.",Battle Royale

My respect for the film grew, as it became apparant that it was not going to be a mere teenage thriller-- when some of the kids tried to cooperate and help each other. While the film was too short for an in depth analysis of the characters, each one seemed to be real as opposed to being actors doing lines. However, I also understand why it is unlikely that this film will be shown in the US.  Even if the characters had all been adults, the violence was extremely graphic.  With children, even the ""R"" rating was impossible.",Battle Royale

I really hated the two random students who were added - Mr. evil crazy hair and Mr. goody goody. Basically they did all the killing, they looked about 25 years old. The stat lines at the bottom are absolutely hilarious. The Teacher was just ridiculous. Not to mention that the government was paying 20some soldiers for 3 days just to kill a few middle schoolers.

422,nikolaischillersdeathnot,This is how you make a death game movie,10,30 March 2012,"One of the greatest things about Asian cinema is that they are not afraid to go all the way. This is a film, unlike most American mimics, that you can actually see the brutal kills. ""The Hunger Games"" was a movie that chickened out in detailing the brutality that their characters were actually going through. Thus sucking all the tension away. This film, on the other hand, got straight to the point and developed its characters while the game was in action. ""The Hunger Games"" attempted to do this with its flashbacks, but failed, as the information it gave us felt rather irrelevant to anything that was happening during the battle. In this film, however, it shows us why certain characters act the way they do, and why certain characters are willing to kill certain people. We get an insight on the relationships; a girl who doesn't like another girl for disliking her clique will probably get killed. A girl who knows his boyfriend cheated on her with another girl will probably kill the boyfriend and the mistress. Plus, there was a larger sense of urgency with this film since they had collars on their necks. I do, however, wish they had gone a little more into the terrible consequences of the danger zones, which kept switching, but you can't have everything. Another thing that the film did really well, with such fine sedulity is the basketball game. These flashes to the game were necessary to entitle that all these kids who are killing each other are all friends. The film had many great set pieces, most of which involved the question, 'can you even trust your best friend?' Would you? I wouldn't. This film has a rather cryptic ending, but a simple message. Based on the novel, which turned manga, this film does feel a little amateur at the beginning, but once it kicks into gear, it is great. The violence by the way is very fun, but not as gory as I suspected. 10/10",Battle Royale
423,ZombiesIntheSnow,A look at true human behavior mixed with drama and action.....,9,28 August 2006,"Battle Royale is in no way a subtle movie, in fact it's the opposite of modest. Up and front here is the plot: a class of 42 students are put on a remote island by their school teacher and the Japanese government to fight to the death. Yeah yeah, it sounds a little lame and sort of over the top but the movie conveys a deeper message then you may think. As the movie progresses, more and more of the students resort to murdering their best friends and classmates in order to survive for themselves, and sometimes just out of pure violent rage. Battle Royale illustrates the compelling nature of hate and violence that lives inside of every human alive; the chilling rage that you and me both possess. Not only that, but a political message is also present in a vague sort of way; in the beginning scene of the movie you are shown a crowd of reporters and people rushing to see the winner of the battle Royal, all eager to see who survived the 3 day long bloodshed; i thought that this showed the thirst for blood modern man has, the urge to witness violence.The director did a great job at keeping the violence low key (there's not a lot of major gore) but nonetheless capturing it in high intensity; most of the deaths in the movie are very emotional and some of them lightly disturbing. Although some people may laugh or dislike the love stories that are sketched into the film, i thought they were actually touching in a lame Japanese sort of way (no offense to anybody that is Japanese, i simply meant that the vocabulary and choice of words made by the characters are not all entirely American sounding.) Another good aspect of the movie is that the acting is mostly genuine in my opinion, and plus all or most of the actors were actually high schoolers (give or take a couple of students and teachers/soldiers.) On a final note, i urge anybody who is interested in this movie to just WATCH IT and stop hating on it about it's plot, the plot is original, a tad bit over the top (which in my opinion is interesting when it comes to films), and influential. GO WATCH IT!",Battle Royale

The movie is taken from a book so maybe it's better if I read the book now. There are a lot of original ideas which are very good and make the movie enjoyable, but there are also a lot of scenes and conversation without sense. For example the girl at the beginning enter in the classroom saying ""I didn't know"" but nobody knows what she didn't know, and nobody know why the other guy stabs the professor. Why a lot of guys waste their time talking to the opponent so he is able to turn the situation at his favor!!! Why the girl who has the opportunity to shot to the professor runs away!

425,dreaminspira,"A Enthralling Film, Yet Lacking Something...",8,11 January 2013,"Battle Royale is possibly one of the most radical films I have ever watched. I must admit, I heard about this movie through one of my friends and on a whim, decided to check out what it was all about. To my surprise, it was very similar to The Huger Games but caused many controversies around the world for its ""violence"". This intrigued me and being the rebel I am, I watched it. The movie itself was bloody but not very graphic and nothing that would cause a heart attack. It mainly consisted of gun wounds. The entire film is very hypocritical, consisting of a social satire. The government tries to do the ""right"" thing and the right thing ends up throwing ninth graders onto an abandoned island to kill each other until one remains. The consistent playing of eminent classical music only serves to add to the irony of it all. The real beauty of the film comes from the ways each student deals with their incredible situation. Obviously, for such extreme situation to occur in our world would be extremely unlikely but to bring that type of situation up and illustrate how high school students would deal with it, the film definitely hit the mark. Some panic right away, clumsily indecisive, kills by accident or timid resolve. Others decide they don't want to play the ""game"" and commit suicide. Some are insane, incite up a killing streak similar to that of a serial killer. Inevitably, sexual tensions arises, given Japan's obsession with hentai, what do you expect? Yet others try to rally others to form a ""peaceful"" group that ends up killing itself through misunderstanding while the most brilliant, hacks into the government's computers and planning to send a bomb into the heart of the government and escaping. While the different methods each student uses to cope is diverse, interesting, and relatable, there's something integral that's missing. The characters, through their actions, seem interesting and relatable but through dialogue and background, very, very hollow. At times, some of the characters seemed fake. But what more can you expect from a one hundred minutes movie involving 42 characters? All in all, Battle Royale was an interesting, unconventional movie that takes a bold move in the midst of generic comedies and action thrillers.",Battle Royale
426,Coyotewinters,Modern Day Bread and Circuses,10,23 March 2014,"If I was asked the following: ""What movie would you heavily recommend?"" Battle Royale would be the first one in mind as the novel-to-film adaptation is a powerful, profound and controversial creation I have ever stumbled upon. Often times when it comes to foreign movies, I cannot stand to bother with reading the subtitles as I consider them a major annoyance. However, since this one piqued my interest I didn't particularly care for them. Relieved is a huge understatement because if I hadn't decide upon testing the waters with Battle Royale, I would have missed out on the greatest opportunity by far. The acting is believable and consistent, which is offhandedly rare these days. I actually became attached to quite a few characters and even felt for them when they died; even though their fate was inevitable from the beginning. One possible plot-hole I want to point out is the warning of multiple danger zones. I don't believe either one of them accidentally stayed or came across a danger zone. Lest I missed that, then the mention of danger zones was pointless and didn't add to or hinder the plot in any shape, way or form. Otherwise, my review doesn't do this film justice and I suggest everyone, whether you're a fan of foreign movies or not, should watch it at least once in their lifetime.",Battle Royale
427,kierstynle,A Great Film That Is Under-appreciated,10,22 February 2014,"Battle Royale is one of those movies that leaves you kind of shocked. While controversial in its native Japan, I was honestly glad it wasn't an American- made movie. They probably would've turned it into a melodramatic gore fest. Yes, the film was violent and gory, but it focused on emotional and psychological aspects more, and that is what made it fantastic.In a alternate present day, the government has issued an act, called the ""Battle Royale Act"", which is an event where randomly selected teenagers are placed on an abandoned island and forced to fight each other to the death. However, they only have three days to be the last one standing. If more than one person is left alive at the end of the three days, a collar placed on their neck will explode, killing them. Yes, there are many similarities to The Hunger Games. However, the novel in which Battle Royale was based on was written more than ten years before Hunger Games was published. This film is intense, thrilling, exciting, and actually well acted for a cast of mainly inexperienced teenage actors. Far better than it is given credit for.",Battle Royale
428,thriftshopninja,"Not the strongest Modern Japanese movie, But still great!",10,27 November 2006,"Battle Royale is not only one of the best money making movies in Japan, but originates from an equally successful book and resulting manga series of the same name. It has become a cult hit in alternative movie rental stores and the internet for many years now, with people mainly owning a copy through EBay auctions. It wasn't until recently that the DVD release of this movie was available to America, complete with the sequel for the first time with subtitles, and a behind the scenes in Japanese with no subtitles. I hope this review will help anybody who might have heard of it, or not, be introduced to this superb movie which takes a stark look at all the different archetypes of human personality.At first glance, the synopsis of this movie makes it sound like yet another action blood fest, and many critics in America will quick to label it as such. In a chaotic near future, the Japanese government is fed up with the rise in student disobedience and violence against teachers. So, every year, they ship a random ninth grade class to a deserted island, and are forced to wear collars. They are to play a game: Last one to live wins, if nobody wins after three days, the necklaces will detonate. The viewer naturally assumes the movie will be not unlike the Saw series or any number of rehashed action gun-slinging movies. However, the skill of the director is his reluctance to fall into this pattern. Instead, the movie studies how differing personalities evolve when faced with this danger. The viewer wonders what they would do in such a situation. Could you turn on your friends? Try to stop the violence? The film takes all of the differing viewpoints into account. What you end up with is a beautifully shot, and also wonderfully scored, movie reaching into the core of each character, and every viewer can relate to at least one students plight.While there are scenes of gore, they are done much differently in other Japanese movies such as Suicide Club or Ichi: The Killer. They are more unrealistic, holding more true to the manga than real life, more comparable to old samurai movies or Kill Bill (which in my opinion was much more gruesome). The blood that is in this movie, in my opinion, should hardly deter the viewer from the deeper story, and never seems out of place or over-the-top.The directors also choose a strong respected cast to back up his story, including the great actor/director/comedian/writer Takeshi Kitano, as the students' old teacher. While this is not Kitano's best performance, he brings believability to the character that makes you feel for him as much as you despise him. The rest of the large cast is just as strong, with only a couple bad apples. The only main issues are some things lost in translations. In one scene, A subtitle reads ""This Demm Actual Situation"". But it shouldn't take away from the film. The acting is powerful throughout, as you see both the ugly and good side of each character, which only makes the losses more tragic and the victories more inspiring.I would recommend this movie to anybody interested in psychology, especially in younger teens, just as soon as I would recommend it to Japanese movie fans, drama fans and action fans alike. When the credits roll, which I imagine you will sit through for more of the superb musical score led by Masamichi Amano you will be left with an experience not soon forgotten. However, I would just as soon advice against the sequel, headed under a different writer, where it is a fine movie it never comes near matching the greatness of the original.Also, there is an American remake coming out in 2008, which many will fear will skip the emotional content of the movie to favor the violence. It will be released by New Line Cinema, and part of the anxiety is the producer, Neal Moritz, who was also behind Torque and XxX 2. Many feel Moritz will merely make a violence flick, playing up the guns and toning down the real feeling of the original, adding on to the growing pile of Japanese ""rip-off"" movies in the last two years. My advice is seeing this movie before the greater public forgets it for the remake.",Battle Royale
429,mybrainhurts84,blown away....,10,27 February 2015,"Battle Royale is not only a great film but also my favourite film of all time !!! I first watched this when it came out and i must of been about 17 maybe and i was blown away by it. When i first heard of Battle Royale i knew i wanted to watch it but not being a fan of subtitles was the only thing putting me off, if i wanted to read something i'll read a book was my attitude. But when i read somewhere that someone said it was like Lord Of The flies on acid i knew i had to see it. From the off set and i saw the scene of the previous winner i was hooked, seeing that face with the creepy smile sent my mind into overdrive !! If your reading this review you'll already know the plot so i won't bother repeating it. I'll like to thank Battle Royale for not being crap because if it wasn't for this film i wouldn't of bothered watching another subtitled film but my love for world cinema is huge thanks to this one film , i also kinda prefer foreign films to Hollywood nowadays. If a film about school children killing school children isn't your cup of tea , this film isn't for you, but if you can get passed that this film is well worth watching !!",Battle Royale
430,dpeterson-83696,Perhaps the inspiration for 'The Hunger Games',5,12 July 2016,"I happened to stumble across this movie on Netflix. When I read the summary I thought it would be a Japanese rip off of the Hunger Games until I saw the copyright date.This movie frustrated the hell out of me. The premise is workable, the cinematography is well done and the acting is very good, but the script ranges from confusing to downright nonsense.Here come the spoilers: 1) When the kids wake up, they have no idea what's happening to them, as if they've never heard of this ""Battle Royale"" thing. Yet the movie opens with a shot of a news reporter announcing the winner to what is presumably a national audience. And it obviously isn't the first time this event has happened, because they include TWO previous winners in the group. It makes no sense that the group of students are ignorant of what's about to happen.2) What is with the group of girls that think they're going to ride it out together in the old lighthouse (I think it was a lighthouse). They were warned that everyone would be killed at the end of 72 hours if there was more than one of them left alive. During ""orientation"", they saw one of their classmates stabbed in the head and killed, they didn't take that seriously? 3) There is a scene where one of the girls goes out jogging on the trails (unarmed) and a boy rides his bike next to her (also unarmed), teasing and making veiled sexual comments. This after both of them have already witnessed at least one murder, and possibly committing one or more themselves. Just another day at the park, nobody's going to try to kill me while I'm working out... la la la 4) The premise itself is just silly. The government is forcing 14 year olds to murder each other because the younger generation doesn't show enough respect for its elders. Really? That's the best idea you can come up with? I could go on, but I think you get the idea.",Battle Royale
431,yoshida82,"Great movie, greater book.",8,14 September 2005,"Battle Royale is a great movie, I kinda live by it. I don't know if the movie was ever published in America. I live in Holland and over here it's rated 16+ (mature content). It's based on a Japanese book that very often is compared with Lord of the Flies. This book is made into a manga that contains over 13 volumes, eight episodes each. I'd highly recommend reading both the book and the manga.Forty-two students of a randomly selected class are kidnapped by the Japanese government, moved to an uninhabited island and equipped with randomly selected weapons. The students carry explosive collars around their neck in order to force them to participate in 'The Program'. The Program requires the students to kill each other within a time limit of three days until only one remains. The game is led by the sadistic Kitano, who tells them 'It's kill or be killed.' Thus causing fear and mistrust amongst the students.SPOILER The lead character is Nanahara Shuya, who refuses to participate in the game. His best friend, Nobu, was killed by Kitano. Nobu had a crush on Noriko, who was a very shy girl. Shuya intends to protect Noriko, eventho there can be only one survivor. They hook up with Kawada, a transfer kid who was last year's 'winner'. He says he knows a way off the island. Meanwhile, the ice cold psychotic kid named Kiriyama and the sex obsessed Mitsuko play to win.This movie is mainly about trust, relations and how people deal with it. For example: when the wounded Shuya is nursed by a few girls who hide in a lighthouse, one of the girls who is afraid of Shuya tries to poison his food. One of the other girls eats it by accident and dies. That's when the remaining four girls get paranoid and kill each other. The girl who poisoned the food survives but jumps off the lighthouse. Shuya knew a few of them had a crush on him and he feels guilty over the girls killing each other. /SPOILERThe film is packed with this kind of sequences. Lovers commit suicide, but the number one killer (except for those who play to win) is confusion about some of the relationships amongst the students. The message the movie seems to convey is 'leave nothing unsaid, you might not get another chance'. The biggest plus of the movie is the diversity of the students: there's always someone to identify with. The moralism of the way the story is told is almost as strong as the explicit violence it contains.Japanese movies have a very good way of keeping you in suspense and Battle Royale is a very good example. Anyone who decides to give Asian cinema (Japan, South Korea) a shot might consider obtaining this movie any way possible. Those persons also might consider avoiding it's sequel, Battle Royale II: Requiem, like the nine plagues of hell.",Battle Royale
432,ervin-jarvlepp,If you're interested in thought-provoking psychological horror movie...,9,7 December 2006,"In the end of 1999, people in Japan started suddenly criticizing and discussing a very shocking and controversial novel that was written by Koushun Takami. The following year a talented director and producer, Kinji Fukasaku, took the responsibility of making a film that would base on the novel. The film was called Battle Royale (Batoru Rowaiaru in Japanese).The 2-hour movie has affected many people. There are rabid fans of Battle Royale as well as abominators of this film. Let me explain you how one movie can create so discordant opinion. The film tells about a group of high school students who are sent to an abandoned island to kill each other. Although the idea seems very bizarre, it was developed from common social problems that were also in Japan at the dawn of the millennium. These included unemployment, teenage anxiety, civil unrest, and a nation terrorized by their youth. Young people are much more volatile nowadays than they were a few decades ago and that is what Battle Royale focuses on.As the movie was supposed to carry on an important message, it had to be made more interesting than the novel was. The screenplay was written by Kenta Fukasaku who made some noticeable changes in the storyline. The movie begins with the government passing the act of BR  Battle Royale. It is a survival program, where the worst class of the country is selected to participate in a game. The rules state that the participants will be sent to a deserted island where they will have 3 days to kill each other. There can be only 1 survivor. If there is more than one student alive after 72 hours, everyone would die.The role of the class teacher, named Kitano, is played by Takeshi Kitano. At the beginning of the movie he is stabbed by one of his students, after what he resigns from school. A year later he is already leading the BR program and his former class is forced participate in the slaughtering. Kitano played his heavy role as best as he could. Throughout the whole movie he was very strict and serious. Even in the scenes where Kitano shows out his fondness for his student Noriko, who resembles to his daughter that doesn't love him, we cannot see any change of emotions. Other leading roles were performed by Chiaki Kuriyama (Kill Bill: Vol. 1) as Chigusa, Taro Yamamoto as Kawada, Aki Maeda as Noriko and Tatsuya Fujiwara as Shuya. It is remarkable that all the roles of 43 students were given to young actors aged about 16. It makes the movie more realistic and shocking when to see real children covered in blood and kill each other than 25-year-old actors who just have an appearance of 9th formers.After being kidnapped on a class trip, the students are taken to Kitano. Everyone receive a necklace that must be worn. It is for monitoring the location of the contestants and in case the battle is not over in 3 days, they will be blown up together with the participants' necks. After that every children gets some kind of special thing, most of what are pistols, knives, crossbows. There were also unlucky students who got only a headband or something like that. After that, the battle begun. Death of every student was bloody and seemed very lifelike. Even though there were not used many special effects, they seemed superfluous in some parts. The background music was perfect in my mind. It helped to change the mood quickly and the exciting scenes would be quite dull without these sounds.As to the acting, it was poor with some actors. But it is excusable considering their young age. Besides, the plot is so thrilling that there is not enough time to pay attention to acting skills, technical part or other smaller details. The scenery was genuine. Even the minor details on the island led to the conclusion that it was abandoned. The costumes fitted well to the storyline and weapons worked the same way as they do in real life. A small negative aspect is that the movie is in Japanese, which makes the beingness of subtitles important. In the film, there were some mistakes between scenes where the position of a dead body mysteriously changed and words sounded from people whose mouths were shut.All the violence in Battle Royale led the movie firstly to be rated R and than even banned in some countries. In fact, despite the popularity of Takami's novel and the film that based on it, the movie was shown only in 23 countries. For example in the USA the government doesn't control movie industry but, there was not any studio that would like to be related to Battle Royale. The second reason why the film has not become so popular is that it was shot in Japanese and the actors were of that nation as well. People tend to prefer pointless English-speaking movies with Arnold Schwarzenegger in the leading role to much better foreign films that have a brilliant idea. The fear of uprising youngsters is also a reason why the movie is hated by some viewers. Battle Royale is not meant to trivialise school shootings and youth violence. In fact, it is an examination of how far will the government go in disciplining the youth. Many people are against the film because they consider the idea silly.Battle Royale is different, even radical. It cannot change the world because films challenging social norms have no place in our society. The movie was a great success and it has at least changed the views of some people, who should move on to modifying the world. Despite public opinion, films that matter, are still being made.""We may not be responsible for all the things that happen to us, but we are responsible for the ways we react when they do happen."" (unknown)",Battle Royale
433,kos_tsan,"While main story idea is good, the film is bad",6,20 March 2018,"I think this movie is overrated at 7.7/10.Despite the fact that the original idea has no total logic (send kids to kill each other to evaluate life and ethics etc??), all the remaining issues have no sense as well.1) Why their school principal (their sensei) has so important role and even the military guys obey him? He is just a school principal after all.
2) Why on earth, the military left without checking for the last 2 bodies, in order to determine the winner. They got scare of the principal?? It makes no sense.I could count down for ever but lets stop here. 
The only good about this film is its main purpose, throw a bunch of people in an island and tell them to kill each other until is only one survivor. They could make a better film much easier.P.S. The sequel (BR2) is even worse",Battle Royale

435,euanmacd,forget the slick hype: this film sucked,3,11 November 2001,"The obvious film to compare this to is the excellent, wacky, well realized american film Series 7: The Contenders. In that film there was intelligent social analysis and alongside the dark humour a keen understanding of human emotions and indeed motivations. Battle Royale, by comparison, is just bad and wrong. Granted the first twenty-five minutes are reasonably entertaining and original, after that it descended into gunfire (with only the memorable grenade instant to alleviate the boredom) and cheap, obvious sentimentality. The ending was appalling (and when thought about doesn't make sense: I take it the 'good' transfer student fired blanks or into the air but how could he have known that the systems would be down and therefore the noise of gunfire would be enough to convince the authorities that the other two were dead) and the acting, apart from Beat, was ropey to say the least. There was no sincere or believable character development: the central romance was amazingly corny. So many things in that film just had no point and were badly thought out, e.g. hardly anything was made of the danger zones. The photography in the film was obvious and repetitive: this may come as a shock to some but to make landscapes look nice is probably the easiest job on earth for a cinematographer- its the landscape of the face that matters and that was completely lacking. The flashbacks were glossy in the extreme: glimpses of just how bad and run-of-the-mill this guy really is as a director. My penultimate point will probably irritate (I'm hoping no one else had made it- I haven't read all the comments): in the aftermath of sept 11 (which I think all art, especially film due to the nature of the media coverage of the event, has to be held up against) anyone who finds the double suicides (for an obvious parallel) or just general chaos of the film moving must be an emotional cripple. I have absolutely no problem with films portraying violence- watch a genuine slasher or horror movie they're far more entertaining. However, if a film sets out with the lofty intentions of combining violence with intelligence and emotion they must do it well; if not, life imitates art imitates cheap, false emotions. Finally, I can hardly put into words the disgust I have for the person who dared to call this film the 'greatest film Kubrick never made': beyond incredibly superficial, banal nods to Kubrick (especially soundtrack wise)this film had nothing of his in terms of intelligence, consistency, and above all beauty. Lets all hope the master rests in peace.",Battle Royale

Most actors here play at high school level, not more, trying really hard to convey whatever they want to show, nothing seems authentic here. Just as bad is the plot. We are thrown right into some kind of hell where the teacher takes revenge on the kids because they have all been very bad kids with no buildup to this at all, so nothing you see will actually be earned. All over a pain to watch. Seeing the high ratings from so many users and even renowned magazines makes me doubt the sanity of my fellow cineasts.

Not a gore film yet. But as you can see childish violence and story when the army got hacked unreal.

440,nwilhelm31,"In one line, a B-class film with a brilliant new concept on the 'opiate for the masses'.",8,13 July 2006,"This film follows in the great tradition of every empire (real and fictional) that seeks to intimidate or distract its populace with sport and bloodshed. Such tactics began with throwing Christians to lions during the Roman Empire days and has been seen in more modern years with such classics as Rollerball (the 1975 classic), Deathrace 2000 (another 1975 product, 'hit and run driving is no longer a felony'), and The Running Man (who knew hockey with Arnold could be so dangerous?). Plus Points: Loyalty test: Who do you trust when you are in a fight to the death? Truly tests their relationships.The perky announcer. The cute teen shown in the Battle Royal introduction tape (aka 'How to make friends and kill your classmates') was probably the funniest part of the film. Inter-student combat. Well done. There is a stereotype for every viewer to identity with. Different weapons and tactics. Concept was also well done. You didn't know what surprise each of them had. Also liked the 'danger zones' forcing them to move instead of just hiding, and the teacher's encouragement when announcing the list of dead students. And they say you can't get good teacher role models these days! (Ooops! Sarcasm slipped in there)Psychological suspense. Who would kill who? The paranoia and violence of the lighthouse was quite a surprise! Excellent portrayal of a variety of characters types.Lack of Predictability. There was no way you could predict what was going to happen next. Any filmmaker who can end the film with the viewer saying 'hey, I didn't know that was going to happen' (unless they cheated and read the manga or internet guide) deserves a round of applause in this day and age of serial imitation and stereotyped mediocrity. Minus Points: Language was a killer. Now, my Japanese extends to about 12 words, good enough for greetings and ordering sake, so I had to do with the English subtitles. I certainly hope that was not an exact translation. Some of the lines did not make sense, were inappropriate, or even seriously confusing ('your parents have been informed, so go for it!'what the heck was that supposed to mean?). Many plot holes could have been filled with a minute of verbal text in the appropriate places. Character acting. I haven't seen so many overused display actions since the early Godzilla movies where that one guy always runs out and says 'Godzilla!!' There were so many shakes of rage I thought they were having epileptic fits. I was surprised that with all the red-faced eye-bulging no-one popped an eye out. I can appreciate method acting, but more natural reactions of horror and agony would have been appropriate. And what's with the dropping to their knees and clasping their arms over their heads every time they experienced doubt or anguish? I had flashbacks to the village peasants in the original Seven Samurai film (the black and white film, not the anime), wailing and bemoaning their future pain and death. Poor marksmanship. Geez, these kids are untrained in weapons but hasn't anybody ever heard of a headshot? Several of them shot Kuriyama in the chest and he just grinned and kept coming. Youth reactionaries. Excellent work with the Mimura group doing some hacking and home-style bomb-making, but was very disappointed that all the work went for nothing. An attack on the soldiers around the school headquarters would have been a win-win event for viewers; a boost for those supporting the students against the system AND a confirmation for those who think that the students were 'dangerous'. Plot holes. Every story has them, but this one had several major blunders that made you wonder how they could have been missed. 1  If the media covers every BR event, why did these kids act like they hadn't ever heard of the BR before? You'd think they would have at least heard it as a threat from their parents (""the next time you stay out past midnight you're getting put into the next BR!""). 2  If this is an opiate for the masses, and the media is clamoring for coverage (as indicated at the start of the film) why isn't the event televised? The event does not satisfy the bloodlust of the masses, nor does it intimidate the youth into proper behavior. If neither is being done, what's the point of the BR? 3  This one I can only confirm through transcripts, but apparently the senior military officer was a 'Second-Lieutenant'? This only demonstrates that the screenwriter knows little or nothing about the military (wait for the BR2 review for the same writer to get a real slagging). This BR operation has at least 50 soldiers, a helicopter detachment, GPS tracking system operators, a slew of technicians, and the usual assortment of 'evil henchmen'/ 'death-robot' types. This type of operation is run by, at the very least, a Major, more likely a Lieutenant-Colonel. Considering that it is a 'national' event, an annual hi-profile media event, and that the BR staff will report directly to a government department (the BR Committee) when it ends, it is even believable that the senior man would be a one-star general. Help lend the audience some credibility here.",Battle Royale
441,yeahhyeahyeah,Intense movie,10,3 September 2007,"This movie was really intense. At first when I heard about it, I thought it'd be violent and stuff, but certainly not to the extent it was. For some reason its a lot more disturbing to see high school students my own age getting killed/killing each other in brutal ways in this Japanese film than it is to see the same (or worse) brutality in the action films the US puts out today.This movie takes place in future Japan where the chaotic condition of Japans population leads the govt to institute an act called Battle Royale, where a random class of high school students has to kill each other off. Obviously this background story is a very bad excuse just so they could have a reason to focus the movie about teens killing each other off.From the beginning, the movie is intense. You see a man who has hung himself, a student knife his teacher. Once the students are taken to the island, their teacher makes it clear how real it is. It was extremely intense seeing how the kids reacted to their situation. You find yourself studying them to see whether they will be the ones who try to win, or who try to save their friends.Every time someone got killed, you feel extremely bad for them, because they are just a kid. Every time someone kills another kid you think ""Why did you kill them, it was your classmate!"". The film develops almost every students character at least a little, telling you their pure, honest, deepest thought/desire/motive, making you love the character for who he/she is right before they are brutally killed. And even for the students who kill others, you end up feeling bad for them.Interestingly, most of the students do not try to save themselves. Three boys set up a way to beat the system, hack into the 'school' and escape. Two girls earnestly call for everyone to stop fighting and help each other, right before they are killed by the 'transfer' student. A bunch of girls hide out in a lighthouse. Some kids commit suicide. Some wander looking for their secret crushes and best friends. Trust, friendship, and betrayal are all intensely packed into each second. The transfer students are very interesting too.Almost every character has a 'crush' on another character, or is best friends with another character. Its strategically childish and innocent, making you feel all the worse when they innocently and desperately declare their love for another student in their last dying words.",Battle Royale

Exceptions are apparently made to this rule, exemplified by the the unfortunate survivor of a previous BR who gets drugged and sent back as a ringer. But the rule itself - one which rewards the one who is standing last - that is dangerous. Laugh if you want, but it's not such a far cry from sending prisoners (or juvenile deliquents) on a 'Survivor' type contest like this. Hell, the networks are preparing us for this type of thing now (see Big Brother 2; not a big stretch from playing at slicing someones throat to actually doing it on-camera). What I got from the film is: what will we allow? I think those who ask these kind of questions ought to see the film, if not the general public. Be outraged, but not at the director. At those who find the pain of others enjoyable when packaged properly, and we who do our children a disservice by creating an environment where violence is a viable option.Nyah.",Battle Royale
446,jprc-3,"Great concept, but could've been better",8,1 February 2007,"This review kind of spoils the film a little bit but not enough that I think it would ruin it for you.I saw Battle Royale with some friends and absolutely loved it. It's a truly inspired concept in a movie that targets intellectual content as much as gore, so that it's great for mainstream audiences. There are several scenes in the film which I rank as some of the most incredibly produced in all film, such as the Reservoir Dogs-esquire lighthouse scene, and the entire introduction.However, there are several issues on which I believe this movie could've been improved upon and become one of the greatest films in cinema history. I personally would've cared for more strategy and build-up in the film. Most of the characters you simply meet and they die. I would've preferred for the killing to have started a bit later in the film with several scenes to build up the suspense in a style similar to ""Treasures of the Sierra Madre"". Also, I absolutely hate the ending. For those of you who have seen the film they should've ended after the competition had a winner and Kitano was doing his exercises. Instead, they wanted to add a somewhat happy outcome, while at the same time adding a bunch of unnecessary subplots at the last second including Kawada's story, Kitano's story, and the final one which leads to the terrible concept behind the sequel.Because of these flaws, I'm somewhat looking forward to the America version as current American films enjoy analyzing high school cliques and I feel this might help further develop the analysis on relationships this movie portrayed. However, at the same time, I know that the remake is probably going to simply be a Hollywood gore-fest with no depth and I should stop lying to myself about the possibilities.A must-see for anyone. The best part about the movie is probably discussing strategy with friends afterwards. My English class voted that they would all kill me first because we were realists about the hopes of survival and they all know I'm an eagle boy scout and would set all sorts of traps and stealthily hunt them down. Though, I don't believe I'd be able to kill anyone and would probably just hang out with friends until we all died. Also, my choice weapon would be the tracking device. Guns are nice, but, like I said, I'm a survival kind of guy and I'd much rather have the tracking device than someone else with a gun did. Great weapon for offense, defense and simply enjoying the time you have left on earth.",Battle Royale
447,dustin_karner,"Not a bad watch, yet overrated",4,6 December 2006,"Considering from the voting, I think its hyped WAY too much, maybe from people who never saw Asian or controversial films before. This may sound arrogant, but my review is directed for those people who seek for controversial/gory/disturbing films.Controversial..well, the plot/story is quite sick, no doubt here; but it has too many ""Hollywood like"" scenes and all in all it just feels like that....a ""semi shocking"" experience, most of the violence is unfortunately just like that, just doesn't feel ""real"".Gory...Bad news for all those gore-hounds out there; if you looking for a rain of blood/guts/brain, you definitely will be disappointed. Look above, most of the violence is unfortunately Hollywood like machine gun take downs. Yes, you'll see lots of bloody dead bodies, but nothing you haven't seen before like a trillion times in random action movies. The film has the occasionally blood gushing cut throat, but really nothing that will make a true gore-fan happy.Disturbing...If you ever saw another truly depressing movie before, this wont shock you in any way. YES, (again), the story and the whole idea behind it is sickening; but the film as whole just doesn't deliver the ""hammer to the head"" feeling.The characters that are killed are mostly nameless and faceless persons, you wont feel sorry for them at all.So enough of the bad talk, the movie definitely has its strong moments as well. Like pointed out before by some other comments, the beginning is strong, very strong. It keeps you interested, disturbed and confused (well, if you haven't been spoiled).********MINOR SPOILER WARNING********The ""video game"" like intro to ""the game"" is particularly hilarious (possibly an ironic sidekick of how violent games maybe influence minors to killing other people), as well as the *occosially* killing of two the students by the teacher in charge, followed by ""harmless game"" like applause immediately afterwords.So the movie has some really nice scenes of dark humor. In the end it also delivers a nice yet overdrawn message of that life is hard and painful and to make the best of it, which I like a lot. On the other hand the cheesy ending deeply disappointed me.******************Overview.....If you like random, rapid killing without too much tension but with a decent message, this is perfect for you.If you looking for gore, there is better films for you out there. If you looking for tension, well, see above If you want to be disturbed, see one or two lines above.Overall I'd give it a 6 outta 10, because I really like violent movies, but I felt that the ""8-rating"" on this site give the film a little too much credit. By all means watch it if you have the chance, but don't order it for 10 bucks if you looking for gore or to be disturbed.",Battle Royale

450,rusty_james,A Metaphor of the Japanese Education system....,10,9 April 2007,"Many comments on here have gone into depth about the author's own thoughts on the film ""Battle Royal"" from a Western, cultural point of view. This goes to show that there is a message here that transcends the cultural barrier. Truly, the film's imagery and interpersonal conflicts can be related to on many levels and it speaks to people of many nations. For the moment, please leave those comments behind and try to understand what the film is saying towards the culture that it comes from; that is to say, audience for which it is truly intended for: The Japanese in order to add another dimension of understanding. More of less this film is about the Japanese Educational system. It's a metaphor- an extreme, gory, shocking and sometimes humorous metaphor, but a visage of a system in Japan nonetheless. Let me explain: First, the Japanese school system is extremely competitive in the pre-high school and high school years. There are tests that actually place you in college and furthermore your ""rank"" in the education system. This literally determines your place in society. Needless to say, the competition for placement in a good school and the tests they give are high-pressure. The angst that a child new teenager feels is strung throughout this movie, silly ""I love you- you must help me"" themes, the click theme, the young lovebird theme, the ""devil may-care"" theme, and yes, the suicide theme. Each of these steps point to a part of the Japanese school system and outlines the way children feel when they are reaching puberty within the school system here, and truly it reflects the broad range of extreme feelings they have. The pressure, the hatred, the rivalry, the distrust- it's all there. Second, it shows how the school system provides failure where there should be success and success where there should be failure. The rampant, uncaring students that ruin everything for a few good students, the way that sub ordinance is more important than speaking your mind, and how the ability to stab another in the back in order to survive is marked out in no uncertain terms. All of these things are truly stemming from the no-fail school system where uncaring students are moved along the lines, pushed into factories in later life while screwing it up for everyone else in the process. Third, the character that Kitano ""Beat"" Takeshi plays is bitter-sweet, one that is borderline insane and erratic, truly speaking for the teachers locked into the system that will not change for its own good. The pressure and sadness that Kitano portrays, along with extreme humor in announcements and act of violence approved of by the system, creates a dark metaphor for a system that is not only failing the students, but dashes the hopes and dreams of teachers to bits. Hopefully when one looks at this film, they get the humor in it and see it for what it really is: a social commentary not meant to offend, but to entertain and shock one into thinking. This film is worth owning. It has a very potent message, but is enjoyable enough to watch over and over. It truly has a large cult following here in Japan and is a source of release for teens feeling the angst of school.",Battle Royale

Actually, this movie is the ANTI-Lord of the Flies...instead of kids going bad, Battle Royale shows how this horrible situation brings out the best in many of the kids. In fact, only a small handful of the kids actually obey the kidnappers' orders to fight and kill; many of the rest seek to save their friends, band together, and find a way out of their terrible situation.I'm still not really sure how the movie does it, but Battle Royale manages to create nearly 40 distinct and interesting characters in just 100 minutes. The range of human emotion and audience identification with the characters surpasses ANY movie I have ever seen. Battle Royale is an epic in every sense of the word. Every time I show my pirated DVD copy of Battle Royale to my film-buff friends, they expect it to be gratuitous, shocking, and disturbing...instead, they find it to be triumphant, beautiful, touching, and even philosophically deep.It's SO worth it.

458,biora,A satirical mess...,1,1 April 2003,"Just some quick notes to add another perspective. This film is incredibly violent, but it is more the background that makes it disturbing. But upon taking another look, the film is clearly flawed and comes off more as the Director showing how he hates teenagers. All of the students are extremely stupid, and had they not been stupid, nearly all of them would have lived. The adults aren't likeable either. Above all, the film is missing several things, and most importantly, it lacks a purpose. The Battle Royale system of the film accomplishes nothing rather than knock off one class of many, rewarding potentially, the most violent of all the children. Clearly, last year's smiling winner hasn't learned a lesson about not being a delinquent. The director of this film is a paradox - he is stuck in the past of thinking that adults control children and in the future of pushing films to be more violent. The film, overall, is flawed and ends up being just a slasher to me.",Battle Royale
459,DonnyCornelius,"Visually mesmerizing, stunningly crafted, a true classic",10,23 June 2003,"I first became aware of this film from some website that had a trailer for BWII.  Thanks to the modern marvel of Ebay, anyone and everyone could (should, er, MUST) see this film.  Granted, watching a film with subtitles automatically causes most of the movie-going public to tune out immediately, there is still so much that is visually visceral about this film that even without subtitles or a knowledge of the japanese language, one may still be enthralled and drawn in by the sheer aura of this film.In terms of plot development, the fine line between trust and betrayal is never more abscure than in this film.  It turns what could easily have been a campy, horror film into a study of human psychology that seduces the viewer with it's complexity, then drops the heavy end of the hammer on them with it's gory visuals and violent nature.  If any advice should be given to a prospective viewer, it's to stick with the flick to it's conclusion. Much of the transitions in the beginning that deal with flashbacks were poorly handled, but ultimately, after a bit of thinking, these scenes become more evident, especially upon a repeat viewing. To further stir the pot, after seeing the film, read Koushun Takami's novel, ""Battle Royale,"" from which the film gets it's plot.  The film is very true to the original story, though as is the case in any adaptation, sacrifices were made to cut time and make the film more presentable to the public.  At 600+ pages, the novel certainly expands upon the relationships presented in the film, and delves further into the nature of the society which would allow such an event to occur. Simply put, this is the greatest film I have ever seen.  It has become the template against which all other films I will ever see from this point on are judged.  I show it to everyone I can (or at least anyone with a dvd player that can play dvd9 discs).  Make the effort to see this film, the reward is well worth the cost.",Battle Royale

While its messages are very serious and powerful, I think it is a fun film in the sense that you can choose your favourite characters and see what fate has handed to them through their weapons and consequences of their actions. It is also one of those 'What would you do in that situation?' films, which is always an interesting topic although nobody can truly answer unless they have experienced the 'game'.

The book does an amazing job of forming strong relationships between the classmates, and showing how those relationships can be broken under extreme circumstances.  Each death is painful to read, because you know that these aren't the same kids who just weeks before had been finishing up their classes, and it's hard to watch someone who you know is really just a nice person die in a painful and horrible fashion.  However, watching the film version is just painful and horrible.  Basically, the movie just throws you right smack dab in the middle of all of this, without knowing about any of the characters beyond Shuuya (the lead), or how they know each other.  It feels more like 40 strangers were dropped on an island for the sole purpose of putting as much gore as possible on film.

467,zephrelial,Battle Royale:Winner of the Battle Royale of movies..,10,6 March 2004,"Either I behave objectively or subjectivelt my feelings and my experience urges me to label battle royale as the best movie that is shot.This might seem a little exaggerated comment nevertheless it is based on certain observations upon the film.The kanjis at the start of the movie,the ferocious waves bouldering over the rocks of the island that the Battle Royale takes place,and the epic music equals to an impressive and energetic beginning which is quite important.And the colors red and black are chosen while describing and summarizing the situation to the audience.There is great harmony in the pace of the beginning of the movie.It is managed and edited quite skillfully.The scene where we hear the voice of Shuya,a stunning quote ""When I was at the 4 th grade mom left,and in my first day of the 7 th grade my father hung himself.."" I believe many people that have loved the movie will remember this quote for a long time.Until all class members are gathered together and the plot is revealed the pace of the movie is incredible.And it never fails to slow down until it reaches the climax and finally the ending.Until the scene that sensei Kitano appears and the incidents begin to occur the people might wonder what is the plot of the movie and that is a nice surprise.There is a dark humour that we can smell all over the movie.The scene that when Kitano murders Fujiyoushi his comments about the people that died such as ""Here is the list of goners,here is the list of your dead friends.."" Besides he doesnt lack the more personal comments other than addressing people.When yumiko and kitano calls out for help with the megaphone he comments over it by saying ""calling for a peace was a good idea but you can't win them all!"" Also the mood of the movie is supported by a few ironies such as Hiroki spending all his energy and risks his life to find and save the girl he loves,yet he is to be killed by her hand.(Kotohigi) and yuko causing all the trouble in the lighthouse by accidentally poisoning yuka and she is the only one that is not seen guilt by the maddened Satomi she quotes""You can't be the one.. You are not from their group."" Besides all these,the performances of the young actors and actresses are great(on contrary to what many people think).Their mimics the way they express their grief and horror,anger is remarkable.The flashbacks and the backgrounds of certain characters enriches the depth of the movie and puts a better meaning to it.The way that these juveniles perish,their hopeless desires for clinging to life even for a short 3 days is exquisite. The soundtrack of the movie and the musics that takes place in it are marvellous and absolutely fits the movie.The screenplay is wonderful I can say that there is nearly no unnecessary scene in this movie.There are lots of things in the movie that happens that we expect not to..(Nobus early death the main character's best friend.)or in the scene while Chigusa dies and she asks Hiroki whether she is the one that he loved or not,it is sad and surprising that even in her last breath Hiroki is unable to lie to her. There is every aspect in Battle Royale that makes a great movie great.While you watch it you are absorbed by it and you see how the concepts of friendship,love and trust are fragile and they will be easily impaired by the malicious and darker desires of human nature and how the urge of survival ensures this.Moreover,it is a beautiful adaptation of the book of Koushin Takami.The only part that I didn't like in the movie is the end.I am quite disturbed that the end of such a great movie should have been in the part when Kawada dies on the ship and in his mind he thinks:""I am glad I found true friends""and the screen goes dark there like ending however unfortunately It does not end.If it ended here the movie could have a direct message to give.But it ends with a lousy running scene Noriko and Nanahara holding hands together it makes an impact that none of it was real and hard. Apart from this Battle Royale is the movie that has won the ""Battle Royale"" of the all movies ..",Battle Royale
468,badnewsjones,"Over-Hyped, Pretentious, And Riddled With Clichés",4,8 October 2006,"Having nearly exhausted the catalog of ""good"" horror movies, I've turned to explore more ""shock"" cinema, of which Japan is currently forefront, mostly because of Takashi Miike's twisted brilliance. I've heard much about Battle Royale since its release in 2000, particularly in regard towards its shocking premise and excessive gore. I was excited to see this movie, but was sorely disappointed with the actual experience.Obviously inspired by Richard Connell's short story ""The Most Dangerous Game"" and Golding's novel Lord of the Flies, Battle Royale puts a class of forty-some students on an island. Tracked with explosive collars, they must kill each other until only one survives; if they refuse, the collars explode and they all die.This premise, however, is poorly executed. As a substitute for effective storytelling, the movie uses clichéd characters. They are cardboard cutouts easily recognizable by anyone who has ever seen/read any anime/manga. There's the ""mysterious and dangerous transfer student"" right beside the ""crazy/psychotic student"" that are sitting behind the ""couple who hasn't confessed their love for each other."" The real interesting characters are, of course, the ones that fall outside of these stereotypes. Those characters, however, have very little screen timejust a scene or twobefore they are killed. The possible exception is Chiaki Kuriyama, who inspired Tarantino's Gogo in Kill Bill.This brings me to the movie's fatal flaw. The movie shows every single student die. That's 42 deaths crammed into a 2 hour film, actually, more like an hour and a half considering the class isn't on the island for the first part of the movie. This creates many problems, cinematically. Half of the time, the movie basically follows the story of the four, rather uninteresting stereotypes, for most of the movie. The other half, you're introduced to a dozen other plot lines that are never fleshed-out. The main storyline is constantly interrupted by sequences of subplots. This ruins the movie's pacingyou can't help but notice that they're trying to cram too much into the movie. Since these subplots are glossed over instead of explored, they come off as basically excuses to show more students die. Now being a horror movie and shock movie fan, I don't have a problem with a lot of people dying, but when there are only 4 or 5 memorable deaths out of the 40-some, it's not a good sign.Which brings me to another let-down of the film. I kept hearing that the movie was incredibly gory and violent. However, I'd be willing to say that the violence in this movie is on-par with US prime-time TV, say some of the CSIs or Nip/Tuck. There's a good amount of cheap looking CG as well, you know, the kind you get from crappy straight to video movies that Sci-Fi shows on Saturday nights: Killer Rats, or perhaps Python. Overall, this movie is no gorier or violent than the mid-Friday the 13th movies, it simply has a higher body count.The movie fails to redeem itself with its ending as well. You'll be able to see the ""twist"" ending a mile away.This over-the-top movie makes its social analysis hard to miss, but all of these problems simply work to undermine any kind of commentary the movie makes on contemporary Japan and its youth.Although I've never read the novel or the manga, I'd say that this would have made a much better miniseries or TV show. That way, the clichéd, main characters' story would be somewhat marginalized, giving voice to the more unique characters and room to explore some of the more complicated social dynamics that were only glanced at in the movie.As it stands, howeverlike many ambitious horror/shock filmsBattle Royale has only a few notable elements buried in a mess of problems.",Battle Royale
469,amygirl-319-383662,Worth your time to check out the DVD!,7,19 March 2012,"The DIALOGUE in this movie, like the book, is sometimes cringe-worthy (you know, like, 'Damn! I survived, thanks to my excellent bulletproof vest!!'). However, because it is usually delivered perfectly and on target, I hardly noticed it. (It may also be because the actors were speaking Japanese and I was only reading subtitles because I can't understand Japanese.) Although I did like the book better than the movie (tells you how good the book was since I think the movie is FANTASTIC), there are some moments in the movie that outshine even the book because of the acting and the way the dialogue is delivered. For example, Yukie's LIGHTHOUSE SCENE is much better in the movie than it is in the book. I love the way their voices become delirious and the way their anger escalates (it's nearly palpable!).Also, the setting is well-done, too. There are a lot of neutral and cool colors like whites, grays, and cool blues that set the mood and provide a contrast for all the bright red blood. That reminds me: this movie has, like the book, been criticized as VIOLENT EXPLOITATION. That is understandable since the movie shows young classmates killing each other in messy, realistic ways, some willfully and some out of fear. The movie is v. bloody and v. violent and sometimes gratuitous. I normally don't like violence, I don't like blood and guts and gore flying everywhere. I really hate those 'Halloween' and 'Freddy' and 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' type movies because blood spills needlessly and in an excessive/stupid way. But 'Battle Royale' is different.

And its certainly a pleasure to see the horror and realization as the students watch a promotional video explaining the rules of the Battle Royale law. Priceless! Kinji Fukasaku was 70 years old when he directed this film. This is an old man still in touch with problems in japans society. The distances of thought and mentality obviously on Fukasaku's mind but so to must the ability of the fickle young to turn so quickly into murderers. But he is on the pulse too with the visual aspect of the film. Blood and guts aplenty. Tension builds through the formation and decay of bonds between characters.

472,latigre,One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made,10,7 December 2004,"Firstly, how this film has not made it into the top 250 films ever is frankly beyond me, it seems from the voter breakdown that it is foolish users of the 45+ age range who are pulling the rating down. Fools. Personally, this film would be in my all time top 50 easily. That's not something I say too often, but Battle Royale is not the kind of film you might see too often.Using a premise that could only be born in the East (Western films just don't have the imagination) if this film ever gets an American remake heads shall roll.The intro to the film sets the scene well, showing a vision of Japan where schools are not seen as important by children and gang rule reigns over the country. To control the school children the government sets up an act which places one school class every year upon a designated island. Once upon the island the children are given various different weapons and have three days to kill each other. The last man standing lives. If more than one is left at the end they all die. Although this is obviously a fictional scenario it does seem pretty premonitory, as if you ask me, it seems as though school kids are going that way. However a film such as this could only be made in Japan as in a market like the mainstream American market, much of the audience would pass it off as either too controversial or ungodly, some rubbish like that.Now I'm not saying that I'm better than anyone because I like this film, I'm simply saying that the film addresses issues in the world in a completely different way to any other film. The film should be first rewarded for its originality but then should be seen to be an ultimate classic because like so many other films it promises so very much but unlike so many other ideas this one actually delivers. The film is so well made and the parts are excellently portrayed. Considering half of the actors were just teenagers, the skill and precision of their acting is astounding. Another point to mention is the music within the film, especially at the beginning, music is used to great effect and really kept the film moving well, the drama of many scenes was greatly intensified by the powerful classical soundtrack.The ending to the film is a little strange but after repeat viewings it all makes sense. This film took me through it all, I was scared, sad, happy, I laughed, I worried and above all I was gripped throughout. This was a film I could not tear myself away from had I tried. To top it all off, if you still don't like it, it has Takeshi Kitano in it. What's not to like!So get onto it all you +45ers and rate this film more highly. Give it the rating it deserves and then maybe more people will be introduced to its glory.Oh by the way, forget the poor poor sequel. A film this good should never have had a sequel because it couldn't be topped, it's like making Citizen Kane 2 (which they'd probably market as Ci2zen Kane, but I digress) Anyway, just cause Jaws 2 was like watching paint dry, whilst being relentlessly beaten over the head with a pointy club, that doesn't make the original Jaws any less of an all-time classic.**********/********** - I'd give more stars if I could but I don't make the scale so I guess I'll just have to live with the ten.",Battle Royale

The blood and graphics are a little corny but funny yet cool to see. I really enjoyed this. Anyone who is anyone would see this movie. The way the people die and the whole idea on how they have to kill each other is awesome. I wanted to see more explosions and better deaths but when you look at the way people died in this movie and the way people died in any movie in America, you will definitely say that the deaths were interesting and unique enough.

From the comments I've read, it seems that reviewers were completely focused on the characters themselves, and not on the interactions between characters, which allow the film to develop. When watching, it is important to note the connections between the film's key players. Note the interactions and attitudes between Noriko and Kitano, Kitano and Kawada, Kawada and Keiko, Kawada and Noriko, and of course Shuya and Noriko. Several reviewers seem to think that characters like Kiriyama and Mitsuko are worthless actors thrown into the mix to add some violence. Maybe they are. But if you spend your time looking at the individual characters and the violence they spawn, you're missing the story.Also, this film will be much much easier to understand (especially the ending) if you read the novel by Koshun Takami with the same name.",Battle Royale

What you have to do is look behind the violence, the storyline is prettydam cool, and Battle Royale 2 is also good but not as good. You guys should definatelly watch this and see what you think. The best idea is to buy the special edition because that has the requims on which give a deeper story to the characters such as Misuko (a girl who was basically raped as a kid and stuff).

The movie is NOTHING compared to its explosive trailer. Within the first fifteen minutes: a suicide, two killings, and a girl, clutching to a blood soaked doll. Given its R-15 rating, or NC-17 in the US, you would expect sex, nudity, and violence. In most all DVD or VHS versions of BR, it is rated NC-17 for violence, edited to contain the minimal amount of nudity (Mitsuko's sex attack by cutting off two guy's....things)....nonetheless, Battle Royale is a brilliant movie, filled with violence, blood, action, romance, scandal, and more.

477,rnb_instrumentals,my review,10,19 January 2005,"I'll start off by saying that this film rocks! And here's why: The storyline has a reality-show premise: 42 students are kidnapped from a field trip, and end up on an island where they are forced to kill each other within 3 days, or everyone dies.That's just the story; it gets deeper: Some opt for suicide rather than kill their classmates. Friendships fall apart. Some even get a slice of revenge on the ones that picked on them (in school)! There are plenty of twists and turns in the flick, especially in the ending, which I won't reveal (so you'll actually go and buy the DVD). ;-) As far as whether America should bastardize this film, I say NO. They already did a crappy version of Ringu and recently: Ju-On (the Grudge). Eastern and Western culture are vastly different (humor, for example). You can't just take a movie that is built on Asian virtues and throw say, Ashton Kutcher or the Olsen twins in it and boom! a hit. B.R. has some things only Asians can relate culture wise (e.g. the pressure to study for the National exam so that they won't disgrace their families), but its message is clear-cut IF you're willing to read the subtitles.

Try to imagine all of that angst and emotion and confusion in the most extreme circumstance: dumped on a deserted island with a map, food, water and a weapon, where you have 3 days to kill your classmates, or be killed yourself.When I first read a brief description for this movie, I knew this was one I had to see. Deemed a horror movie in America, this film is NOT your typical American slasher flick. It has been compared to ""Lord of the Flies,"" a great comparison, I might add. It pits young teenagers against one another on a deserted island, and survival instincts take over, and void out almost all traces of humanity in some. Something I have not yet seen it compared to is the Richard Bachman's (aka: Stephen King) short story ""The Long Walk,"" where teenage boys signed up for a contest where they basically walk until death. There is only one winner of the long walk, as is the case of ""Battle Royale."" I watched the dubbed version, but the story, atmosphere, and acting were so amazing that anyone could easily see past the mediocre subtitles. The young actors were awesome and easily believable.

479,night_crawler_01,Avoid it like the plague,5,24 July 2009,"Awful movie... but what did I expect from a teenagers movie? To tell the truth, the title and the IMDb rating made me think it was much better than what it turned out to be, at least for me. The idea isn't totally original, there have been many movies where people are forced to kill each other to survive. Any gladiator-type fight will be based on it. And we have seen plenty of gladiator fights, from roman circuses to futuristic prisons. But what totally ruined it was the acting. None of those kids seemed to have any acting experience, so why did they try to play like karate superstars? Overacted. Unrealistic. It could have been *slightly* better if they had just moved a bit more naturally. So do yourself a favor, stay away from this, avoid it like a leper, and spread the word.

480,redemmeed,A dangerous masterpiece,7,27 May 2005,"One masterpiece with 1 flaw. Battle royale has a very interesting concept and question asked to anyone, can you kill your best friends to survive? It takes us through a 3 days journey of a group of year 12 high school students, drugged and ended up in an isolated island in Japan. Unaware of the horror to be unleashed among themselves, they initially starting off with positive attitudes, innocently thinking that they could somehow manage to get out the big mess without having to kill anyone or themselves. Until, some twisted classmates starting on a killing spree. The casting is great, one the best casts ever assembled. Everyone seems to be into their characters, not to forget that they are still in their teens and early 20s. A special mention to Tatsuya Fujiwara who plays Nanahara Shuya, the main character. Tatsuya blends into the character well and he is definitely a rare gem in Japanese cinema. Interestingly, Nanahara becomes the unlikely hero, a weak yet determined to stay alive and he did. The score and classical music used in the movie also work well to create the illusion and atmosphere. And yet, like a true Japanese movie, this one also cursed with some stupid flaws, like the villain still kicking and shooting well right after he has been shot many times, and on the ending, where after the pyschophat teacher has been shot, he then wakes up, walking and talking to his daughter on the phone before he dies. It just does not make any sense, but this is a Japanese movie we're talking about, land of cinematic weird and violent.",Battle Royale

It's great at telling how all of the characters, most of which are just innocent school kids and friends, can be turned against each other, all in a attempt to save themselves. Saying that though there are some of the characters that refuse to betray their friends and stay loyal to each other.

Sadly boring is the best adjective I have to describe this movie.There are also several scenes that were changed.

483,ceccleston,the best film I have ever seen,10,25 July 2005,"Battle Royale is a film by Japanese director Kinji Fukasaku, based on the novel by Koushun Takami. Both are controversial, because both are very violent, featuring young students killing each other in a no-holds-barred contest to the death. A fight for survival against their peers. In short: this film is not the for faint hearted, and no doubt thats where it gets its criticism.For those willing to sit down and watch Battle Royale, you are rewarded. This film shocks, scares, amazes and dumbfounds at every new scene. I can't watch this film without feeling distinctly uncomfortable - but I like it.Look at the film technically: The directing is near perfect - Kinji Fukasaku really was a master; the soundtrack is amazing and fits perfectly with every step made, every bullet fired, every death, every dramatic line by the actors and every heart-stopping moment; the script is exceedingly well written, with numerous memorable lines (some of which on IMDb's quote bank); the acting is remarkable for a bunch of teenagers, while the only real adult character - ""Kitano"" - is played by the always-brilliant Takeshi Kitano.Everything fits together, and everything works. I honestly cannot fault Battle Royale in any way - except perhaps for the omission of the car chase from the novel.The only drawback stated by some, which I don't agree with, is the violence, which is often and is incredibly bloody.I give this film 10 out of 10, but only because 10 is the highest allowed on IMDb.",Battle Royale
484,jaakkosaaristo,A sleep-inducing soap built on a surreal manga setting,3,22 April 2018,"There is one point which makes this movie valuable, which is that it first puts on screen the Battle Royale idea from the novel that has since reached huge popularity in both movies (Hunger Games) and computer games. The current world top selling on-line multiplayer game (PUBG) is a Battle Royale derivative. Point is, the points will go to the author of the novel, not the movie.I managed to finish this movie without calling it quits in the middle, which happens with many bad movies. But there was nothing there worth seeing. All the ideas are completely unrealistic, badly acted and badly directed soap opera cliches. The utter lack of realism is nauseating, which of course might satisfy a manga fan who would likely ""artistically"" appreciate the images and so on, but for me that sort of stuff is unreadable and pretentious waste of time and penny. I mean, if you are mentally 4 years old, you'd likely like this kind of stuff; it is a children's story but just in a violent setting. The other nauseating thing is the borrowing of every single cliche of a classical piece in movie history (like Bach's Air) and playing it loudly and constantly in the background. Yes, if you are hit with a stick long enough to lose any concept of sense of style or artistic taste, what will probably be left is like a first time experience of hearing these pieces that have been endlessly overused in every single exploitation piece of crap movie in the West for decades and decades.Then again, the movie eeriely reminded of Verhoeven's Starship Troopers, which is a similar unrealistic ""commercial-like"" depiction of a fascist reality where young men are drafted to a completely unrealistically violent war. This movie happens to be made 2 years before the publication of the novel. I recently tried to rewatch Starship Troopers but I couldn't, it is simply a nauseating, not because of the violence but because of it is trying to justify the lack of realism with an out-of-this-world story of a dystopian society that bears no realism to it. I dig so many dystopian movies, just not a dystopia where the government ""punishes"" random kids with random violence utilizing techniques from concentration camps. If there's something wrong in the Japanese society and this depiction hits on some contemporary social issue, I am sure this sort of unrealistic fantasy makes no effort to intellectually address it, and I believe exactly that is the point of indulging yourself into a fantasy instead of trying to actually be critical of your society.",Battle Royale
485,AnewId48,Wouldn't say it's a 7-8.,5,13 December 2017,"I watched this because someone had mentioned Hunger Games not being original (and nothing is really) and it peaked my interest as I was curious. I went into this thinking it must be good if someone made the connection, but note I still knew it was IT'S OWN THING. So none of this has anything to do with H.G. it's just how I found the movie. 
Just to start, I saw this was a book and surely the book is better than the movie because surely the movie was like this because of the typical book to movie problem of not enough time to tell the story.
The plot is alright, though they didn't go too much into it. Kids are little turds, adults don't like it, let's have them kill each other; in laymen's terms. It started off strong and while overall it was a decent movie I wouldn't recommend spending 2 hours on watching it. It ends pretty much how you think it will, the people you think will win do, and the fights you think will happen do. It's predictable but most movies are. 
My main problem with the movie is there are just too many characters. I get it's an entire class, but they try to fit too many back stories in. I get that some of them are problems in Japan, but trying to make me feel bad that someone is dying because he never told his crush how he felt? When I did start to feel bad for a character and genuinely felt bad for them, the scene is ruined by the worst death acting I've seen. More than twice, maybe even more than thrice, they'll have a touching moment and then just let their head fall. I got a good laugh each time. I get your head will fall but some of it is unnecessary and out of place. Some of the way people acted out dying was so ridiculous and I couldn't help but laugh. Even in the touching ones, I'd feel and then they'd do the absurd head drop, even if it's not needed (one girl had her head resting on a guy's shoulder but made a point to throw her head forward to emphasize her dying). Aside from the absurd death scenes, they have no respect for realism. SO many characters take at least a dozen if not more machine gun shots and still get back up like they just got punched instead. They'll have two dozen rounds in them but stand back up to try and run or make some plea and it just got to the point where I couldn't take any of it seriously. The blood and effects don't bother me. They're used (mostly) properly and make sense, people are dying of course there's blood. 
Overall, I couldn't take it too seriously. It's a good movie for some laughs. It's an okay movie otherwise. 
TLDR, bad acting, too many characters, funny death scenes, okay but predictable.
 SpoilsAlso the only time someone reloads is the 'bad' guy and it's after you've wondered for the 5th time if he'll run out of bullets. Is he really the only one to get extra ammo? There's only one other uzi we see and I get they'd maybe give him a lot of ammo but if they're going to give a bunch of kids pistols to kill each other, I'm sure they'd give them ammo. So many people but that dude (except the one time because plot convenience) ran out of ammo. I get it'd get boring but if you're going to have them reload at all give some other people a chance. Not really a spoiler but I guess somewhat.

The description showed good potential, reminding me of works like 'Das Experiment' and 'Lord of the flies'.Sadly, the film turned out to be utterly disappointing: the violence is there just to shock as many people, the 'scenario' is almost non-existent and shows some impossibilities (the IMDB guidelines advise me not to say which, but it won't be hard to find out yourself) and the acting is totally over the top - Takeshi Kitano being one of the very few exceptions.For me, most of the time, giving opinions on the IMDB stops at rating the film. But after having read so many cheerful reviews and a score of (on the 15th of February) 8.1/10, I felt it was my duty as a decent citizen to inform you of the emptiness of this total crapmovie. However, if you want to see more than 30 ways of killing an opponent, this one is highly advised!2/10.",Battle Royale
487,germanpp,"Masterpiece? I found it simply a violent, bad movie.",2,6 February 2002,"I am amazed by all the praising reviews I have read since I watched this movie. I respect all opinions, but all got for my money were two hours of cheesy, violent entertainment.I personally did not find it specially sick or shocking. It was simply too bad to be unsettling.The plot does not make any sense in the first place. I do not have a deep knowledge about Japanese culture, but a law like Battle Royale sounds totally unrealistic. Someone please explain to me the positive effects it would have. And virtually all other details are borrowed from previous films; there is nothing original about the explosive necklaces, the fight to death until only one stands alive, the random distribution of different weapons, and so on.Most of the characters were cliché, and many of their reactions were not credible. Add to this the generally very poor performances, and you get a very laughable lot. The hero smoking his cigarette thoughtfully while drinking from his flask and the hot evil girl are especially hilarious.The version I watched was dubbed into French, and I accept that the dialogues are probably better in the original version. But I just cannot believe that a good script can be translated into all those stupid lines. Most the talk about love, fear, trust and desperation just made me laugh.I hope that the classical music sound track, and tricks like the screen turning to black to highlight some key lines of the characters were some kind of joke, and not a lame attempt to give some real profound atmosphere. In that shabby context, I found myself associating the classical scores with TV commercials of toilet paper, tomato sauce and the like.I enjoy being unsettled and sickened by movies. Good films with lots of physical or mental violence tend to leave me in a very good mood one or two hours after leaving the cinema, once the emotions wear out.
As for bad violent movies, like Battle Royale, I guess I have seen enough of them (hasn't everyone?) to be able to sit through two hours of teenage slaughter without being touched at all. Maybe it is that I do not find high school uniforms and Japanese young girls all that attractive. I was going to simply forget about this movie, when I heard all the hype about it, and felt compelled to write a bad review.On the bright side, I personally like Kitano, and he made me laugh a couple of times in this movie.",Battle Royale

The story is full of stereotypical characters and scenarios, but it was entertaining just for the sheer ridiculousness of it all.  Beat Takeshi isn't bad in his portrayal as the lonely-psycho high school teacher, and the kids deliver and honest and convincing performance.  It gets a bit confusing at the end, even though the outcome is trite and expected.  All in all I laughed a lot at the sheer brutality of it and wasn't disappointed.

489,bsa3,"Tasteless, unbelievable gorefest.",3,31 January 2001,"I'm not quite sure how to categorise this movie.  It's certainly not the worst movie of all time -- that dubious honour belongs to Battlefield Earth, and probably always will.  The acting is, for the most part, as good as the script is bad, so I can't flunk the movie outright.The main problem with BR is that it consists of a single idea (high-schoolers playing paintball with real weapons) surrounded by whatever self-consistent background the writers could pull out of their rectal orifices.  In this regard it bears a striking resemblance to Mission Impossible 2, a series of action scenes with a minimally developed plot constructed to fit.  If the ""New Century Educational Reform Act"" were ever to be considered by the Diet, let alone passed, it would bring down the government by second Restoration, military coup d'etat, or some other means, assuming the country hadn't already degenerated into total chaos.Then there's the usual cliches, including the bloodthirsty psychopath with a knack for picking opponents who give him every opportunity to escape in lieu of a severe case of lead poisoning, the usual computer bull, and the single-mindedly vain teenage girl.  The subtitle translation (in HK) is far below professional standards; it includes such linguistic joys as changing ""I'm scared of them"" to ""I don't trust them"", and several lines are dropped entirely, presumably due to an error in timing.  BR's only good point is the acting, although why Beat Takeshi took this job when there are so many better ones is a mystery that only Kudou Shinichi could solve.The interesting bit is that BR would be great if it were a comedy -- there was plenty of laughter in the audience at AMC Festival Walk, Kowloon Tong. Unfortunately, the audience was laughing in the same way as when Johnny Goodboy Tyler finds those still-working jets to use in his improbable revolt against Xenu.  My Sources(tm) indicate that the book was set in an alternate universe, so the plot may be somewhat more believable there, but the movie still isn't worth more than half of the Japanese JPY 1800 ticket price.

490,menrva,"It was more emotional than gory for me, I must say.",10,3 April 2006,"I must say, Battle Royale was as much heart-wrenching as violent. While the initial storyline may seem violent and unnecessarily brutal, this movie is not just a Hollywood-made bloodbath. The actors are all proficient at conveying the reluctance and paranoia which is prevalent in most -if not all- the students. The good majority want nothing to do with killing their peers, as can be seen through some of the hesitation. However, when driven by paranoia and fear of death, humans can commit heinous actions, as this portrays. I found that it was more of an emotional journey. Up then down then up again as the students have flashbacks of a sort to their happier lives back before the beginning of their involvement in the BR Act. This is one of only two movies at the end of which I actually cried. I can understand how this movie would be controversial as the plot is a group of 42 students killing each other off in the endeavor to survive, however, I believe that everyone needs to see it at least once, if not for personal satisfaction then for a deeper look at the more shady side of the human psyche. However, the scenes of a head being thrown through a window with a grenade stuffed in his mouth may be too much to handle for some, and thus, many should wait until they are emotionally mature enough to handle some of the feelings and some of the images that this movie will continually barrel you down with. Other than that, a perfect 10 on my scale for realism and an emotional trip!",Battle Royale

But as the movie goes you develop opinions and start siding with certain characters, whether it's a young couple or a bad ass.

The movie's pretty bare though, and this is coming from a person who has read both the entire manga series, the book, and has seen the film. I can tell you that the film is the worst of the three.

The story had deeper meaning and it made me think about human's morale. It was very close to that of The Lord of Flies. The mix between happenings and music was done really well; it reminded me of Stanley Kubrick's works. The shocking effect of violence was not very much due to the amount of gore and blood but more because of the young age of the ones being violent.

497,nick8199,One of the best movies I have ever seen.,10,17 July 2001,"To start off, this movie is sick and twisted.  That is what is so great about it.  The way the material was presented was the best part.  Anyone can make a slasher film, but this film focused on the psychological aspect. What would you do if you were in that situation?  Every student had a different way of trying to stay alive and this is what made the movie more effective.  The music was great, it was in great contrast to the content which was rather delightful. Overall, this is a masterpiece and everyone should see it.",Battle Royale

499,perezidential-1,Stunning,10,1 August 2001,"Wow, what can I say?! Well, I'd heard this movie described as ""Survivor"" on steroids, and I admit I was intrigued by the violence factor, but after watching it, I must say I enjoyed it more for the plot and underlying meaning than the ""eye-candy."" Despite some people's view that this was a commentary on Japanese 20th c. militarism or the education system (and perhaps that was the commentary espoused by the original novel), I saw this as more of a universal commentary on mankind, namely his (her) propensity to fall sway to raw emotions, such as love, hate, jealousy, cowardice, etc.
The pace and mood of the film is great, with the tone set by the orchestral beginning and the shot of the waves, seemingly mocking the ""war epics"" of the past. The cut to the scene of the previous year's ""winner"": the girl smiling clutching her teddy bear was bone-chilling, as you have a child-killer seemingly basking in the glory at seeing and most likely participating in her fellow classmates die (presumably) horrible deaths.I definitely don't agree with the ""shallowness"" of the characters in the film, as some people have mentioned. We must keep in mind that the characters are 9th graders, not exactly the most complex people on Earth. In my view, they did their part, they acted like 9th graders.  However, that is not to say I didn't feel for these characters. Though sappy and romantic, as MANY teenagers are, I did find Shuya and Noriko somewhat redeemable characters.  True, the rest of the characters aren't really ""developed"" but I don't think it was necessary, as it seemed each character or set of characters was but a device for portraying a fatal flaw of humankind.
True, I did find the film's emotions ""all over the place,"" gravitating from humor, to horror, to tragedy, but I think that was the point, to run the entire gamut of human emotions in a whirlwind, which is not unlike the ""life flashing before your eyes"" which, most likely, many of the students saw before their untimely demise. If you were disturbed, confused, puzzled, sickened by this film, then I think the director succeeded, in the respect that it made you sympathize with the characters' experience on the island.
This film is amazing. I encourage you all to see it.",Battle Royale
500,Dozendreams,"Truthfully, best movie I ever saw.",10,4 August 2001,"The movie ""Battle Royale"" is, in my opinion, a fantastic movie. The plot is 40 students get sent to a deserted island thinking they are going on a class trip, but really have to participate in Battle Royale, aka the BR Act. Battle Royale is a game. A game where the government randomly chooses a 9th grade class, sends that class to an island and makes them kill each other until there is only one left. The survivor will get to go home.Two other students, not from that class, sign up for the game. One of the two, named Kiriyama, played by Ando Masanobu, signed up for fun. He goes on a killing spree and kills about 12 of the students. The other, named Kawada, played by Taro Yamamoto, is the survivor of a previous game. He signed up because he wanted to avenge his girlfriend that he had no choice but to kill because of the game. He be-friends a couple, the boy, Narahara, played by Tatsuya Fujiwara, and the girl, Noriko, played by Aki Maeda. They help each other throughout the movie.Despite the fact that they all have to kill each other, they act like normal teenagers. They cry when their friends die, they have boyfriends and girlfriends, and the good friends stick together. Some of the students come together hoping there might be an ending with more than one survivor. Some of them go mad and kill anyone that gets in their way. There are some nasty parts. Such as a girl with a arrow through her neck, a girl getting her throat slit, and a boy getting stabbed repeatedly in his privates.The teacher that is running the operation, named Kitano, played by Takeshi Kitano, adds humor to the movie. Such as showing a extremly funny film, getting up to answer the phone after being shot a good number of times, and having his last words be ""Cookies sure were good"".Alot of people are saying it was very very violent, but I don't think it was extremly violent. If people just looked at the violence, then it would be just a movie where kids kill each other. But if you actually looked at them as teens then you would see it a different way. How would you like it if you were on an island and had to kill all your friends and classmates in order to live? Or if you were the class loser and you finally had a chance to take revenge on anyone who ever made fun of you?This movie actually made me think. It made me think about how I would act if I were in that situation. Alot of movies I have seen didn't have that effect on me. This movie is one of a kind and I recommend it to anyone. But under 12 should have a parent to watch it with them.",Battle Royale
501,afm13,Lord of the Flies meets Running Man,9,22 October 2001,"A brief plot summary: in a society where morals have collapsed and the ""adult"" world is threatened by discontented youth, each year a failing class of 14 and 15 year olds is forced to fight a televised battle to the death. Such a class is placed on a desert island - attempts to break the rules of the game result in death by means of an explosive which everyone is forced to wear. There can only be one winner - winning is the only way to get off the island. Or is it?The film's main focus are Noriko and Shuya, who refuse to participate in the killing frenzy around them, but must still endeavour to survive. Other plotlines involve different children's reactions to the situation, the banding together of groups, the two uncertain elements (the so-called ""transfer students"" - human killing machines placed on the island to make the game more exciting), the sadistic teacher's personal problems, the power relationships, the rebellious elements and the nascent sexualities of some of the kids involved. The ending is refreshingly un-Hollywood, as is the beginning - to kick off we are treated to the image of Shuya's father hanged corpse.The film, with its lush visuals, excellent cinematography and powerful score works on many levels. The exploration of the power relationships, the psychological introspective and the touching emotional scenes are just one side to it. The other aspect is the blood lust which it elicits in the viewer - one despises oneself for being excited whilst watching the ""game"" but one can't help but be curious as to who is going to win, how others will die, etc. The gore is pretty convincing, although much of the killing is handled with an edge of twisted comedy. This makes the film that tiny bit less uncomfortable to watch.The film makes several points, but essentially the concept of the ""noble savage"" lies at the crux of it. Children are cruel, but can the human spirit prevail?Certainly one of the best films this year. See it if you can.",Battle Royale

509,muljadani,Find the true message behind the violence!,10,23 April 2003,"Many people who have watched this movie failed to grasp the true message of ""Battle Royale"". Director Fukasaku Kinji used excessive violence as a powerful tool to deliver his message, but people often see the violence as the message itself, thus they found this movie as a mere pointless, slasher/splatter movie. What a pity! This movie is all about friendship under attack when placed in survival-of-the-fittest situation, as the movie's tagline clearly hinted, ""Could you kill your best friend?"". The lighthouse scene, for example, delivered this message in the most dramatical way. To appreciate the movie, you must see through the violence like seeing through thick, tinted glass. Mr. Fukasaki asked this at the lighthouse scene, ""Do you understand the meaning of this?"" What is your answer? If you can successfully see through the tinted glass of violence, what you'll find would be a mirror, where you can see yourself and contemplate: In a game of life where there could be only one winner and the rest are losers, which one is you and which one is your friend? What are you going to do?",Battle Royale
510,GCallus,"Horrifically enjoyable, in a terribly beautiful way.......",9,25 December 2001,"I went to see ""Battle Royale"" for two reasons. I was seeking an evening of well-deserved and mindless escapism, and was drawn by the comment on the advert, which described the film as a combination of ""Lord of the Flies"" and ""A Clockwork Orange"". Desperately wishing that such a frankenstein could exist, and yet cynically preparing to tear apart the hype, I felt compelled to attend. I was not disappointed.If the premise of the storyline was a little unbelievable, the rest of the movie was only just over the top, certainly within the realms of reality, however much you wished it not to be so. What was most horrific was not the brutal killings, or even that the characters were children, but the impotence of the schoolkids when they are first aware of their predicament. That realisation is shared by the audience, and is vomit-inducing.Yet beyond that was a remarkable humour: the ""training video"" was hilarious, and arrived in the midst of the aforementioned horror. The hormonal preoccupations of some of the girls is also a constant source of amusement. But what made this movie more than a gory-thriller with potential for the usual quasi-intellectual discussion as to its chances of ever happening, was the delicate application of the odd glint of genius. The touches of surrealism at the end were remarkable, the black comedy salvationist, and the juxta-positioning of brutal scenes with beautiful music gave this silver cloud a platinum lining. While the storyline was clearly reminiscent of ""Lord of the Flies"" (the black and white version, not its disappointing colour counterpart), it was the brilliant use of music that reminded me of ""A Clockwork Orange"". Obligatory criticisms: I found ""Battle Royale"" a little to eager to become a kids action movie, and maybe should have used a little more suspense than it did. But then it would have been unbearable! Maybe not quite in the same league as Alfred Hitchcock or Stanley Kubrick, but certainly a great evening of escapism.",Battle Royale

512,daekar2310,More than something to compare other movies to,10,4 September 2016,"""But tramps like us, baby, we were born to run."" -Bruce SprinsteenMany people throw comparisons around when talking about Battle Royale. The Hunger Games, Lord of the Flies, and The Running Man just to name a few. But to compare it to any of these is just not a fair comparison.Battle Royale is more than a film about 42 kids slaughtering one another under an oppressive government's hand or the slow turning of friends against one another. It is a story about two young people falling in love and desperately trying to survive despite overwhelming odds. In a world where adults have learned that they cannot trust young people, they create the Battle Royale Act in order to maintain control. The BR Act entails that a class of school age children are randomly selected to fight to the death until only one remains or else everyone dies. It would be the bad luck of the protagonists Shuya Nanahara and Noriko Nakagawa to be in the class selected for this year's Battle Royale. As their classmates systematically kill one another, Shuya and Noriko try to find a peaceful resolution without having to kill any of their friends. But, at every turn, their efforts turn out to be in vain as treachery and deceit work their way through their classmates hearts. Shuya and Noriko turn out being somewhat successful and survive the game with another contestant who volunteered for this years game, Shogo Kawada.Battle Royale is also a technical victory. From camera work, to lighting, to acting, to sfx. The most impressive part of the entire film, to me, is the spot on soundtrack, recorded by the wonderful Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra. The only issues I have with any technical aspects are that, at points, the acting can seem overdone and cheesy and that the sfx, at points, are very obviously cg'd in.I still gave the film a 10 star rating because I have a dog in this fight and I consider Battle Royale to be a classic. Especially since this is the film that introduced me to the weird, magical world of J-horror. And, just in case you were wondering, the Springsteen quote at the beginning is not random. The quote comes from the book where is it repeated periodically.Overall, I highly recommend this film. Especially if you are interested in J-horror or just looking to get into the genre.",Battle Royale

518,marluxia-1,Sickening Films Usually Make You Think...,9,14 June 2008,"One of the most brilliant films I've seen. The plot is so unique, yet so common. 42 High School students are sent to an outside island in Japan to compete in a ""game"". The first time I saw this film I couldn't believe my ears. Community has sowed a law to minimize terrorizement, mayhem amongst children. Each year a high school class would be picked on this game to kill each other until there was only one man standing. Sounds simple eh? Well, the plot dives more deeper than this. If you haven't noticed human beings have feelings. Even children though they're life's gaze might be brief. Can you value something more than your life? Could you kill your best friend? Some of the children are against their mission to kill others and try to live their last hours civil, while others go on mayhem with weaponry to deal with their problems briefly. Nothing in this film encourages towards violence. It's just a question of belief/principles of life. Are you willing to stand up and proof that your useful? is the BR motto/goal. Before the game even starts there's an unpleasant tone. The class' old teacher is more than willing to work for the game's goal. He kills two students and harms many others. He mocks the second victim for not being obedient and rivalry in the past. He is then killed by the teacher by the exploding collar. The event is held because of rage and mocking against the elders, which is needed to stop. The game is completely unbalanced. Each player is given a bag, which contains bottle of water, bread, a radio and a map to help you proceed to the non-dangerous areas. They are also given a weapon randomly (an uzi, crossbow, boiler, goggles). Would something like this be a perfect goal for the government to execute? Where is the rescuing angels of the frightened children? This keeps the viewer's mind hurling for pleasant answers. Rather the method is working I say it's proving what we are, humans can never be perfect from the eyes of others. Where are the good doers that save this films ending? There are none! This is the point of the film. If your looking for a good night's tale. I suggest you search for a Disney classic, since this film gives a rather realistic sight of the future, violence and love. Very usual sight of the world, though this version of the world is far from what I would tolerate. Youngsters are the future and should not be kept in the dark.

Looking at his filmography, I decided to get an older film of his, the one that caught my eye was Battle Royale. I fully enjoyed this film. Having read Lord of the Flies, I was a bit skeptical at the beginning (i.e. civilized kids going savage), but this movie was far from the book. Though one should not let the kids watch it, this movie had a very good plot and a good ending. Having only a basic knowledge of the Japanese language, I had to watch with subtitles. I still found the dialogue quite good and I particularly liked how the transfer students were there. The ending was great in that it showed that the 2 survivors could never go back to their normal lives.

521,rolando-villagomez,A great example of a survival thriller movie with substance.,7,21 December 2008,"Although I've never actually read the novel or manga (working on getting the manga now) version of this film, I could recommend that you watch the movie first based on the other user reviews, and since I'm a fan of manga myself. Being a fan, I've ran into this kind of thing with other intellectual properties like Akira. I sure am glad that I watched the anime first, then read the manga. And it looks like an American, live-action feature film is confirmed for 2010-11. I know I will be disappointed.Getting back to Battle Royale, this is a great movie! All the actors do a wonderful job, and you could tell that they had a good time making this movie. The only two things holding this back are the cinematography and the fact that the concept and plot aren't completely original.Cinematography- OK, so it's obvious when watching the film that it doesn't have the same flashy, big-budget production value of a Hollywood movie, which will turn off many ignorant people. But I believe that good Cinematography can overcome any sized budget. But unfortunately the film doesn't compensate in that department as much as it needed to. Movies like the Godfather, Amorres Perros, and Y Tu Mama Tambien are excellent examples of well done cinematography on a budget.If you have watched many thriller and horror movies, watching Battle Royale instantly makes you think of films like Lord of the Flies, No Escape, The Happening, and the like. It's about doing what it takes to survive, and learning what it means to have a relationship with another person. I feel that Battle Royale is a solid step above all those examples because the characters are more genuine and believable.As you have probably read from the other user reviews that people have mixed feelings over Battle Royale. It's just one of those movies that has a strong foundation of plot, setting,mood, and theme, but when you try to talk to one of your friends about it, you can't seem to think of a particular line,shot, or moment in the movie that stands out from the rest.

522,e-yurdakul06,Nothing special,6,5 April 2012,"I've heard a lot of praise about this film and decided to watch it recently. But I didn't understand the hype around this film. I must admit that the main concept was promising. And the beginning of the film is very thrilling but when the meaningless series of killings start, just everything goes down-hill.The main problem with this film is that you can't build an emotional connection to the characters, and you feel nothing about their deaths. The handling of the plot is just hilarious and the overly satirical tone doesn't fit to the theme of the film. Therefore the film looses it's seriousness, in contrast to that the director takes the film too seriously. Besides that there is really an anti-climax towards the end. I was really bored by the killings and they were not impressing at all when the amount is huge like that.Well, what's so great about this film? There are some thrilling moments and gore for the fans of teen-slashers. But the death scenes are very unrealistic and not impressing at all. I didn't like the way the characters died it wasn't that intense. And this was the basis of this film, because it's about this massacre game called 'BR'.All in all it's really overrated example of modern Japanese cinema, which gained a cult following without any reason except the originality of the main story. **1/2 out of *****",Battle Royale
523,missykuk,Question: Why Cant Hollywood make films like this?,10,24 July 2003,"Answer: Because it doesn't have the guts or the imaginationI have been a fan of Asian film for quite a while and find that Asian films are usually far superior to Hollywood films. I watched Battle Royal last year after my fiance recommended it but i really didn't want to watch it after he explained the story. I have to admit im really glad that i watched it because the film is a classic. If this classic had been left in the hands of a Hollywood director it would of been ruined because they would of been to afraid of the controversy and upsetting the studio bosses. After reading some of the reviews of this film i have to say that some people are missing the point of this film they can't see past the violence and the bloodshed.***Spoiler*** The film's main plot is a comment on the moral decline in Japanese society, and the sub plots deal with Teen angst, friendship and the instinct to survive whether it been in school on on the island.I don't want to go into much detail but i have to make a comment on the performance's  in this film. Takeshi Kitano is Brilliant in this film he brings his dry and often black sense of humor to the down trodden teacher to wonderful effect. The best performance of the film has to be Masanobu Ando, as a drama student i know how difficult it can be to act well and express what you need to when you have no lines and he shines as the no morals killer.I was saddened when i heard of the death of the director Kinji Fukasaku, but his films will always be a reminder of how great a man he was.

I knew that I would not be disappointed in this respect. However, I was enlightened after watching it (the directors cut to be exact) because it was well-executed and believable. The character development flows perfectly and keeps the viewer from straying to sympathize with the main characters. Every aspect seems balanced like a ying-yang and keeps you on your toes till the very end of the film. Free-for-all battle films are simply a lost art and hold a great deal of potential when executed right. Battle Royale is perfectly riveting.

Basically we meet up with a bunch of Japanese Grade 9ners who are on a study trip. One moment they are laughing it up, next they're drugged and end up in a classroom on a remote island. In comes they're former grade 7 teacher only know as Kitano (Played by Kitano 'Beat' Takeshi) who will instruct the game. He tells them the rules, kill your classmates until your the last one standing. We meet our two main characters Shuya Nanahara (Played by Tetsuya Fujiwara) and Noriko Nakagawa (Played by Aki Maeda). Then we also meet our other characters. Our sub-main-characters. The romantic kung-fu master Hiroki Sugimura (played by Sousuke Takaoka) who chooses to look for the one he loves instead of participate in the game, The brilliant basketball player Shinji Mimura (Played by Takashi Tsukamoto) who puts a plan to work to take out the school using a bomb and end the game, the hardend Battle Royale vet Shougo Kawada (Played by Taro Yamamoto) who helps out our main characters in the struggle through the game, the seductive girl-next-door Mitsuko Souma (Played by Kou Shibasaki) who uses her looks to lure in unexpecting classmates to their death (well sometimes), and the sadistic transfer student Kiriyama Kazuo (Played by Masanobu Ando) who mows down the students one by one and finds himself in some of the most memoriable fights of movie history. Then the other characters, the students. And so the game does on, day after day until one few students remain.This movie doesnt use flashy hollywood graphics to win over our hearts (well except for some explostions), its shear concept alone makes it a great movie, combined with great acting and this is why this movie is my personal favourite.",Battle Royale
526,medvesztick,The movie vs the book (NO spoilers),5,3 June 2014,"What I would like to mark here is the fact that this movie is based on Takami Kosun's novel. If you have watched the movie/are planning to watch it I strongly advise you to read the book. The movie lacks many elements from the novel that I find essential. They've changed a lot in the plot (not the main story line, but important plot elements non the less) and most importantly the film misses to grab the intensity of the book. The novel expresses very well the absurdity, intensity, horror and drama of the situation while the movie, compared to the book, falls way behind in expressing these. If you've watched the movie and think that you've been shocked, seen a great vision on what humans are capable of in life and death situations, how far dictatorship can go, the expression in extreme of Japanese and generally Asian culture's current dangers/problems then READ THE BOOK and you'll find that half of it is missed in the movie.",Battle Royale

I never remember feeling like I did after I watched Battle Royale. I felt touched. I felt several emotions I hadn't felt since ever, or in a long time. It's a movie that makes you think, about society and the world we live in. It has an amazing cast of actors and actresses, and the adaptation from book to screen has been done amazingly well.

It is the most touching one and makes viewer to think about many things in the movie and to some extent in life as a whole. Actually, films rarely touches me like this and if they do, I still stop thinking about them maybe 1 or 2 hours after they ends. Not so for Battle Royale - it didn't dropped out of my mind for at least 1 week, and I do remember it now quite clearly also. This is definitely the movie I'd like to discuss with my friends about. Most of them liked this movie too - despite of their general differences of tastes (e.g. some likes typical hollywood action flicks, others - dramas and soaps).I'd say it is a legendary film, and it is sad that because of it's not wide distribution relatively few people were able to see it. If it would be a Hollywood production (this is hypothetical), in my opinion it would have won several Oscars and would be very widely known by now, same as, for example, The Matrix.I'd searched for this movie for half a year since I first heard of it. Usually movies, games, audios I want to get so much later comes beyond my initial expectations. Not so with Battle Royale - it came way above my expectations. I thought this film would be more of a typical action film with quite a dull plot, however it doesn't seem so no. And I actually like plot... At least it is not a typical overexploited one (e.g. terrorists-attacks-country, a-maniac-kills-people-and-leaves-clues-for-police, etc.)...Classic. 10 out of 10.",Battle Royale

I prefer it because of the way each character is developed, and they each have their own backstory. However, this film is not to be passed up, so watch it as soon as you can. I loved seeing all the characters I'd read about and imagined put to film. I also actually liked the film's Kitano character over the original book's equivalent, Sakamochi. Kitano just had more personality, and was far more interesting. I didn't like, though, how they made Kiriyama a silent psychopath killing machine in this movie. In the book, Kiriyama actually had a deep, interesting explanation for why he was the way he was.",Battle Royale
535,SimonSondergaardChristia,"Battle Royale ""Batoru Rowaiaru""",8,12 May 2012,"""Battle Royale"" takes place in a futuristic Japan, where the Japanese government captures 9th grade students, and forces them to kill each other under the revolutionary Battle Royale act. The purpose of the Battle Royale act was to punish the classes that disrespected their elders. The storyline of the movie is about, the Japanese government capturing a 9th grade class, with 42 students in it. Their teacher Takeshi had had enough of being humiliated and disrespected, as the class teacher. Therefore he signed the class up for the Battle Royale act. Each pupil was given 2 bags, with a few rations of food, and a random weapon. The movie focuses on 3 pupils who cooperates through the competition: Shuya, Noriko, and Kawada. The 42 students ought to kill each other, until there is only 1 left alive. If there's more than 1 alive after 3 days, their explosive collars will trigger, and kill everyone wearing them. The student left alive will be rewarded with freedom.Overall, I Think this was a great movie, watching the students being forced to kill the ones they loved, was both sad and exciting. You were constantly hoping that the students would work together and escape from the island as a whole. But as the movie progresses you realize that some lost their hopes for freedom, while others killed for their freedom. But there were still a few that was hoping to escape the island as a group. Great movie, I give this 8 out of 10.",Battle Royale

I feel like that all the time."" This movie will give you that feeling for about one hour and forty-eight minutes.I urge any of you that may be dissuaded from watching this film by reviews that focus on its violence to ignore them. This is not to say you won't be appalled. You WILL be. This movie is heavy and explosive and it will hit you like a thunderbolt, but it is in the finest of all possible tastes.I'm not going to try review this movie. While saying things like ""It has a beautiful aesthetic"" and ""it is utterly brutal"" are true, to focus on any one aspect of the film would be to miss the mark. Sufficed to say that any flaws are incidental.Like most things in life, to really appreciate this one the price of admission is respect, openness, and intelligence. This is less a conceit on my part than a fact that is becoming increasingly depressing to me as I get older. Sadly, a lot of people just won't get it, or give themselves a chance to get it. If you do, it gives me pleasure to think that this is one of the benefits that all we who feel like Shuya a lot of the time can reap from life.The point isn't what WOULD you do. The point is what what ARE you doing?

537,stephenlacer,One of the few movies that actually live up to the novel of the same name.,9,23 October 2012,"I purchased my copy of Battle Royale on Blu-Ray, and immediately I was very excited to begin the movie. 42 kids, fighting to the death? I was sold, especially with the disappointment of the Hunger Games. -VISUALS-The movie is presented up to 1080P HD, which I viewed it in. It is clean and crisp, with few standout pieces that support or hurt the visuals. Effects are sometimes cheesy, but the film almost never shows it's age (filmed in 2000). -AUDIO- Presented in both original Japanese dub (7.1 Surround) and English dub (5.1), both versions bring a special element to the table. If you prefer not to read subtitles, then by all means pick the 5.1, which is sharp and well done. The American voice actors aren't always on par, but they are certainly tolerable. Sound effects are somewhat generic. As of the 7.1, they hit perfect highs and spectacular lows. An audio masterpiece, stereo surround would certainly bring this film to life.-OVERALL- The film pits teenagers fighting against one another in an enclosed island, and is filled to the brim with violence, action, and even the occasional ""Awwww"" love moment. The story twists and turns, almost never dragging. What the film does have, it also misses. In the novel, there were 50 students, vs. the 42 portrayed in the film. The film doesn't seem to put any emotion most of the characters, and their deaths are somewhat tossed aside as cannon fodder. In all, it is an excellent film, and instantly became one of my top ten films. It does contain a few cons, but taken as a whole, fully washes out any problems had. An easy 9/10.",Battle Royale
538,senorpelicula871,"""Cookies sure were good.""",9,8 January 2005,"Battle Royale is definitely one of the best films I have seen and I've seen many. After reading the equally fantastic novel, I made a decision to see the film and after a few weeks of waiting, the mailman outdid himself and delivered with gusto.The plot is rather simple. I'm sure you've found the outline dozens of times already, with all the kids on an island, killing each other and all that jazz. Upon reading, some might be turned off at the thought of ""innocent"" teens mangling each other with everything from swords to shotguns to grenades to axes, even poison, and of course sickos will be drooling over every drop of crimson on the screen, but in all honesty the violence isn't that heavy. With maybe one or two scenes that might make you wince, everything else is done with class, not resorting to gallons of blood and flesh flying around as if coming from an uncovered blender.The acting is fairly exceptional and believable coming from actors of such young ages. With only a few hammy scenes, performances flow realistically, ranging from subtle to over the top. ""Beat"" Takeshi proves to be the most outrageous as Teacher Kitano, keeping his laid back attitude throughout the entire movie, providing comic relief and disgust simultaneously (just watch him during the video scene).The only thing that might throw people off is the ending, but after repeated viewings it will all make sense. Pay attention and use your head and you'll get it on the first try. Despite that, everything is great. Battle Royale is worth finding in your town.Four 1/2 out of Five Stars",Battle Royale

The great thing about it is you don't have to follow the storyline if you don't want to, (it is much more enjoyable if you do follow the story) if you just want to watch people being shot or blown up or stabbed you can. It is the only film where you don't have to follow the story to enjoy yourself; I encourage anyone, anywhere to watch it. It is the best film i've seen in a long long time.

I could not have been more wrong. Poor acting, cheesy storyline as well as quite a few unbelievable scenarios made sitting through the entire movie a bit difficult. Now I will admit - the Japanese have made quite a few disturbing movies, and so about halfway through I continued to watch with the hope that something would give me a shock and perhaps give reason for the 7.9/10 rating that it currently has. Sadly, my hopes were in vain. Perhaps I am a bit desensitized thanks to all of the disturbing films that I have seen in my life, but in my opinion, shootings and stabbings do not constitute an extremely shocking movie. Granted - the killing were all done by children, but the movie was just not written in a way that focused on the loss of innocence. I give this flick a thumbs down.",Battle Royale

This movie appears to be more to me, the characterical depth of the different actors is refreshing and impressing at the same time.

543,fsurix14,Just plain brilliant,7,24 December 2004,"When my friend told me about this movie, and after he told me the basic plot line, I thought it would be somewhat of a B slasher movie from a while back. But when I saw it for myself, and saw it was made in 2000 I was astounded at the films amazing cinematography and look. As I continued to watch it I found I was hooked in after the first two kids were killed off. I soon found that it was not only a brilliant concept but a brilliantly scripted and thought out idea, pitting young kids who have grown up with each other, against each other, to a fight to the death. Some of the deaths are gruesome but nothing any major film fan can handle, especially a fan like me who loves horror movies, war movies and such, but what made it great is that the characters dealt with amazing inner conflict. The fear of betrayal, the act of suspicion and the struggle for survival. The acting is played brilliantly by all kids, and adult, but especially the Naharara and the adult teacher. I haven't memorized most of the names yet, since there are nearly 30 major names to really learn, the others are just minor characters who get killed off and are paid no attention too really. I'm disappointed that I don't get to see more movies like this one, since the America film industry hardly ever shows such great forgein films like this one, and I am already looking for the sequel. This movie still makes you think and wonder even days after you watch, making it even higher in film status.

Battle Royale delivered that high suspense bloody massacre that one might expect from any story with a similar plot. Despite the fact that it was in Japanese, I had no trouble following the story, connecting with and eventually rooting for the characters, and enjoying the film as a whole. At the beginning I had trouble remembering who was who and distinguishing between the names of the characters, but after so many characters were gone, there were distinct characters to follow.

546,Indigo_Moon,"42 Students, Three Days, One Survivor, Ro Rules.",9,25 April 2005,"Adapted from Koushun Takami's already controversial novel by the late Kinji Fukasaku, the film went on to make a ""killing"" at the box office, despite it's R15 rating, and has since become a cult favorite in many corners of the world.The premise is simple. In a fictitious Japan plagued with social ills and unrest, the government has passed the BR Act. Each year, a class of junior high school students is sent to a remote location, given weapons and provisions, fitted with explosive collars, and subsequently forced to kill each other off until only one remains. The lone survivor is then deemed worthy to join civilized society. Most think that such a concept for a movie that is so over the top and gratuitous it's insane, but that is not the case. Fukasaku wanted this movie to be viewed by all ages, but putting its gory depictions of death and blood into consideration the ratings would not allow it.But Battle Royale is not without its flaws. There are some plot holes, especially near the ending. Some of the dialogue is too melodramatic and ""cheesy"", but it did most certainly not bring down the film's brilliance. But what it was missing most of all was character development. Unlike the novel, the film had little to offer in terms of characterization for it's characters. In book format, Takami could have spent chapters characterizing each character with deep description. But the movie rendition of the story did not have the same freedom. Instead, it focused on three main characters: Shuya Nanahara (Tatsuya Fujiwara), Noriko Nakagawa (Aki Maeda) and Shougo Kawada (Taro Yamamoto). These three characters are actually given a back story, motivations, and their desires for surviving the Battle Royale. But the other 39 students are not complete strangers to the viewer. Supporting character Mitsuko Souma (Kou Shibasaki) is given an in depth biography of who she really is, rather than just a cunning huntress out for revenge. In the Special Edition DVD, there is an extra scene containing a flashback to her childhood, depicting of how horrible her childhood was, and what caused her to act the way she acted in the movie and the novel. The other cast members did a superb job on bringing their characters to life. Indeed the characters are such familiar types that we are able to learn a great deal about them, though we may only see them for five seconds, because we have all come across them before in our own lives. There are the popular girls, the outcasts, bullies, jocks, the nerd who had more gel in his hair than The Fonz, and that one promiscuous girl that your mother told you to stay away from. This quick characterization works perfectly in the film and is enhanced by the performances of the young actors and actresses who actually look and behave like a real class.Some scenes are memorable enough to last a lifetime. Others, you just seem to forget. One of the most loved scenes by viewers is the Lighthouse Scene. I personally thought it was the most dramatic scene in a movie in a long time. It was portrayed perfectly by actresses Eri Ishikawa (Yukie Utsumi), Sayaka Kamiya (Satomi Noda), Satomi Ishii (Haruka Tanizawa), Hitomi Huyga (Yuko Sakaki), Satomi Hanamura (Yuka Nakagawa) and Asami Kanai (Chisato Matsui). Another favorite scene loved by her fans is Chiaki Kuriyama's (Takako Chigusa) infamous stabbing scene. Chiaki, although she played a small role in a big cast, conveys a beautiful sense of confidence befitting her character and delivers her lines with the psychotic flare. The same act is replayed again in Quentin Tarantino's revenge flick ""Kill Bill, Vol. 1"" in which Chiaki starred as the schoolgirl assassin GoGo Yubari.Overall, Battle Royale is easily one of the finest films to come from Japan in a long time. The combination of a such a morbidly fascinating premise, expert directing, fast-paced action sequences, and a beautiful Classical score by Masamichi Amano make for a cinematic event that is worth watching again and again.",Battle Royale
547,critique-de-ACO,Absolutely fantastic!,10,19 April 2005,"This is my favourite film of all time. And why?

Thise Japs are an evil bunch, aren't they? And that's a good thing, in this case. I've seen so many horror films that have failed to impress me, and before watching this I thought 'God, another one of these mindless eye-gouging films'. But was I proved wrong! And that (again) is a good thing. I even think the acting was good, and I'm very tight about acting.

I cannot go into detail, as I do not want to give anything away. But, I will say that it is a sort of cross between Lord of the Flies and 1984. It gripped me from the start, and subsequently I have lost count of the amount of times I have watched it. Fukasaku kinji was one of the best film-makers to grace the planet with his presence. He is only surpassed by Miike Takashi (Visitor Q et al.). Overall the acting was good. Especially from Beat Takeshi (The Teacher Kitano), as always, though my favourites were Shibasaki Kou (Souma Mitsuko), Hyuga Hitomi (Sakaki Yuko) and Kamiya Sayaka (Noda Satomi), though the latter two did not really have that much screen-time.

550,khp1999,Extremely Disappointing,1,26 July 2015,"I fully understand and appreciate that films based off books have to make changes but why so many unnecessary ones? The plot of Battle Royale was so well planned and thorough that it was completely gripping and believable. The movie had so many plot-holes and was generally just plain confusing because of the random changes made, like Shogo Kawada and Kazuo Kiriyama transferring specifically for the game, just to name one. Truthfully there are so many differences I can't list them. It just added to the confusion and made the plot disappear. The movie itself probably needed to be longer due to the length and detail of the book but, taking into account that it was only 2 hours, the decisions for what should be cut and what should be kept were debatable to say the least. The final battle against Kazuo at the end of the book was utterly gripping so I don't quite see the need to cut this and put in the creepy relationship between the class' ex-teacher (put in instead of the much more sinister Sakamochi) and Noriko Nakagawa which had no impact on the plot. There was basically no character development leaving some of the best characters, like Shinji Mimura, with none of their original personality. For what it's worth most of the acting was good and I found that Mitsuko Souma was probably one of the only characters not completely ruined, although her encounter with Tadakatsu Hatagami and Yuichiro Takiguchi was completely skipped. While some moments in the book had me completely enthralled or devastated I felt absolutely no connection to anyone in the movie but I thought ""it's an action movie so I'm probably just supposed to be focusing on the violence instead"". The fight scenes bored me! They started and then ended. Someone would turn up, fight with the person and then kill them almost instantly. The scene in the lighthouse with the girls was probably one of the longest ones and most entertaining.I fail to see what people can possibly like about this movie besides the violence which is still more extreme in the book. The plot was confusing with little attention being paid to whether it actually made sense and how you could understand it without first reading the book is beyond me. I think I need to read the book again so that this movie doesn't ruin what was an incredibly good read.",Battle Royale

552,DeathsHand,Battle Royale: A minor Disappointment as compared to the novel,7,9 July 2006,"After watching the movie & then reading the book, the movie doesn't seem all that great for many reasons. We, the viewers, don't get much in the way of background story on the class & the politics of their country. The setting is an alternate time of Japan in 1997. The government, called the Republic of Greater East Asia, is lead by a cruel dictator, who may or may not exist. The Battle Royale was established in the 1940's as a way to root out all ""terrorists"" who wanted to bring down the fascist dictatorship or wanted to flee to the American Empire. The movie doesn't convey this, but it instead changes the theme to weeding out rowdy teens because the government is afraid of them because of their sex, drugs, & rock & roll. Another change is that their teacher, Kitano (played by Beat Takeshi), in the movie is only supposed to be a government program adviser for the Battle, as in the students first meet him on the island & his full name means ""blonde haired hill"" which is questioned to be a fake name. The deaths of most of the students are pretty accurate through out the movie, except for Nobu's death in the class room, the beheaded kid later on, & Kazushi (who's death is far more gruesome in the book). The main difference is that the movie plays mainly on the gore angle with very little to do with the characters & their backgrounds & motives, while the students it does exam a bit more closely they end up changing a lot of their stories. The book on the other hand plays upon the fear & paranoia governments have about their people & a possible revolt, while they in turn place that paranoia in each other in order to stop that sort of outcome. All & all the movie is good to watch & good for a violent watch & a decent laugh, but it pales in comparison to the book it is based on (loosly based on) My suggestion is to read the book & then watch the movie as a completely unrelated piece",Battle Royale
553,ma_ge_cu,Obviously made by a stupid and scared adult,1,6 May 2005,"The movie in line with the increasing troubled youth in Japan and teachers that don't know what to do with them is made after a manga. As I haven't read the manga just saw the movie I can just say that the author is just a stupid and scared adult afraid of the youth. He obviously thinks that more though ways of dealing with troubled youth is in place and that a more rigid discipline would just right all the wrongs. The movie is certainly an exaggeration of his ideas but you get the feeling that he is one of the guys approving the use of the stick in schools. If you don't watch the movie trying to get the point of the author then it's a cool and fairly predictable thriller full of action and impossible situations. The other problem is they don't give you a lot of back ground on the situation but as a mindless slaughter thriller it doesn't need it. Any way I hated it because is just a movie that instead of entertaining you or doing something useful for people it just give the idea that ""hard"" discipline will decrease the violence. So if you want to get angry and frustrated or are a weakling and afraid of the kids this is the movie for you. If you watch the movies without thinking then this is a nice gore thriller but then I suppose you won't be reading this any way.",Battle Royale

Lord of the Flies on crack!Like many other movies based on books, this one falls short of the emotional manipulation seen in the book. While the plot follows the book quite closely, the especially gripping parts of the book are just kind of laid out there without any back-story. While still gripping, it could be so much more gripping if you knew of the years of anguish the characters went through before tragedy struck. Still, it's a good movie overall, with some brilliant juxtaposition of unimaginably picturesque scenery with all that gruesome violence. It also does a Clockwork Orange-like number with a lot of beautiful classical pieces that play during the most gruesome scenes.All in all, a good movie.

The premise of this movie is that in a not so far away future Japan will have a serious unemployment issue and 800.000 students feeling that there is no future for them start to boycott school and authorities are afraid of rebellion.Sounds good so far? Wait for it  Teenage rebellion is a great topic, we only have to look around us to see lost and broken children, apply this to a crumbling society and there is potential havoc.Them what do the authorities decide to do? They will randomly choose a class of 40 9th graders put them in an island somewhere and make the fight it out until one remains. Yes, I said randomly, no matter if you are a great student, perfect attendance you can still be drafted to this island  you have to wonder why these teens are so upset. Go figure.Even if killing 40, random students out of 800.000, rewarding the most violent and traitorous of them could have some deterrent affect on the rest of the student population  first they had to know about it and every single student in that class seamed surprised to hear of this BRact (bet you next time they'll read the fine print in their registration form).Technically the film is not so bad, very good photography, competent music and sound track, good editing to. There is a mix of actors ranging from the very good to the ""thank God he died so I don't have to see his acting again).Despite the actors effort the characters are poor, with 1 or to exceptions we know nothing about them, what makes them run  or fight  or just scream scared.In short if you are looking for a gore/slash movie and you have nothing better to do go for it.

560,joeschmit,The social contract is null and void!,10,5 June 2005,"BR had me riveted from the first opening shots of a blood stained smiling girl right up to the end. Movies like this, for me, only come around once in 5+ years.While the premise of BR is weak (how in the world does randomly choosing kids to kill each other scare other kids straight? Choosing messed up kids to kill each other off yes, but randomly?) there is so much of everything else done right that it's very easily overlooked.There are some cheesy / over-dramatic moments in the movie. However, the concept of the BR and what happens to ordinary teens in this extraordinary situation is done brilliantly. Ordinarily harmless teen cliques / social annoyances, now become magnified to the point of life and death. What happens to friends when their choices are kill or be killed? What happens when the social contract is null and void? Spoiler Alert!!!! ------------- One of the most dramatic moments include the scene when a student's collar-bomb is triggered by the teacher Kitano. There is no compassion from his classmates just a mad scramble to keep away. Even his best friend pushes him away helplessly. But after that mad scramble we see humanity still there but pushed down helplessly by terrible circumstances. And my favorite moment: Shogo Kawada and his girlfriend are the only ones left alive with the BR running out of time. As they try to rest, the collar bombs starts to count down since there are still 2 contestants alive. They look at each other and hug. What follows next just blew my mind away as did many of the movie's very memorable moments.The ""Rules"" of BR are well thought out as is the choices of ""Weapons"" given to the teens. Not all the kids are armed to the teeth. Some get useless items or useful items but not as direct weapons.The music is enjoyable and very memorable but I hated the ending pop song which seemed all wrong and disjointed with the rest of the film. I would be surprised if it was chosen by Kinji san as opposed to a marketing vehicle. BTW i believe it is also used as the theme song for a Japanese curry (vermont?).While I was genuinely interested in what happened to the students I did not find much of the violence particularly disturbing or emotional. For that I refer you to any Quentin flick where torture is involved or City of God where Ze meets up with the Shorty gang. I find violence disturbing when it involves a defenseless victim. That only happens once or twice in this movie.It's not so much the violence that is shocking as it is the circumstances surrounding that violence like the collar bomb and Kawada and his girlfriend. This is certainly no, ""yawn... another person died"" in movies like well... BR2, the sequel to this film.However much you may enjoy BR, be warned about BR2 which is a load of crap. Seriously.",Battle Royale
561,bird2k,A Japanese non-SciFi Ender's Game? My favorite movie ever,10,4 May 2006,"First, do not see this movie if you are squeamish, it is filled with ultra-violence (though not as bad as Ichi the Killer or Beat Takeshi's remake of Zatoichi).The basic premise of the movie, is that as part of their compulsory school graduation a group of students is taken to an island and told that only one of them is allowed to survive.The concept, of course, seems ridiculous, even under the dystopian future of Japan the movie takes place in. But, it's lunacy actually helps to increase the movies value as a satire. Although there is plenty of ultra-violence to titillate any viewer, it is not simply shocking but also a method of Brechtian alienation.I saw this movie myself, right after graduating from high school, and it really hit close to home. Although it is often compared to Lord of the Flies, I didn't really see this. In Lord of the Flies, the children created the problems of society on their own. This feels more like Ender's Game where the adults try to fix the problems they themselves have created; and instead pass them onto the children as a result. This especially hits with ""the exchange students"" as it almost seems like something the school boards would do to help teenagers learn. (I must resist the urge to call them TA's.) Finally, the exercise of having ""a most dangerous game"" at the end of compulsory education seems to be very much like the way high school felt to me. The kids in the movie have no experience or knowledge of how to fight that they don't bring to the table on their own; much like how today's students are constantly having to go through independent studies and group work projects with no guidance; rather than a back to the basics teach and then test; then reteach what was not learned approach. The real schools will say that it helps prepare the student for college, but as I found out myself, we'd be better served in college by a better understanding of the basics.So, if your looking for an action adventure story akin to a large scale version of ""The Most Dangerous game"" you'll get that; if you're looking for an intellectual satire on how high school has become a system for weeding children out of society before they get to college instead of teaching them, you'll get that too.And as one note on the film making itself rather than it's content (which missing the point with this piece, but anyway), Beat Takeshi's acting is the best I have seen him. He combines his manic facial expressions and sudden mood swings from his comedy work with the raw talent and believability of his dramatic work. His talent is sufficient to make it seem like this could actually happen if he was your teacher.",Battle Royale
562,Kazuo_99,Immensely entertaining social satire. With a little bit of added ketchup.,10,10 August 2005,"Possibly one of the most original stories to come out in years, Battle Royale makes the transition from page to screen perfectly and is a must for anyone seeking an action-packed, thought-provoking thriller.Probably appreciated more by people round about the same age as the students in the film, this movie will hit a note with any schoolboy/girl. The question asked by the film's tag-line, ""Could you kill your best friend?"" is answered in a most brutal and exciting manner as the film introduces a wide range of interesting and...... appealing characters to whom The Program affects in different ways.Me, I found the most interesting character to be Mitsuko, played fantastically by a young Kou Shibasaki, who mixes innocence and a profound lethality to combine and make her a drop-dead gorgeous package.Beat Takeshi and Chiaki Kuriyama also play excellently, and although for the first it seems all in a days work, the latter manages to make the audience feel immense pity for her while she dies, despite the fact that a minute earlier she is seen to stab a fellow classmate multiple times in the groin (well he did try and rape her!).In short, the whole adolescent cast make their characters a joy to watch (even if it isn't long before they die), with Ando, Yamamoto, Maeda and Fujiwara being standouts amongst the main characters.The direction is also handled confidently and the energy of the action leaps off the screen like a Puma on a burning log. Mitsuko's Death Scene and the fate of the Lighthouse Girls should long standout as evidence of Fukasaku's masterful ability.All-in-all, an amazing experience which I would recommend to anyone between 10 and 110 - this really is one of those films you have to see before you die.",Battle Royale
563,super-mario-lover,Why doesn't Quentin Tarintino bring it to the U.S.?!?!?,10,6 July 2005,"Battle Royale is without a doubt, the best movie I have ever seen. The moment I saw this movie, I knew I had to spread it. In only 5 months I accomplished showing it single-handedly to over 85 people. But what really bothers me is when I have to tell people that they can only rent it from Netflix and that they can only buy it online because it has not been released in the United States. For those of you that don't know, Quentin Tarantino is a huge fan of Battle Royale. In fact, the character Gogo Yubari was inspired by Takako Chigusa, a character in Battle Royale. Last year Tarantino brought the movie Hero to the united States from China. And so what I don't understand is why doesn't he just bring Battle Royale to the U.S. like he did with Hero?",Battle Royale

Essentially the government forces a large class of students to fight to the death. They are put on an island wearing a collar with a time limit. If the time runs out before there is a winner, all of the remaining collars explode. If you try to escape, the collar explodes. It is much more graphic, the weapons given to you can be anything from a gun to a toilet set. It is much more unfair for the students fighting as compared to the American version we see all over these days. The movie is suspenseful and will keep you at the edge of your seat to the very end. Honestly, I'd pick Battle Royale over Hunger Games any day.",Battle Royale
565,donthedragon-1,"Japan's authority over their youths has diminished, and now the adults have found a new way to take control...",10,14 August 2005,"This Japanese made film is about how the adults of Japan had lost control, and feared the youthful in the near future. So, in retaliation,they form a law called the 'Battle Royale act', in which every year a class of students are taken to an island and are forced to kill each other until only one of them remains. This remaining student is given the right to go home.This film is without a doubt, one of the best films i have ever seen in my life.For starters, this film is Japanese, so you can be guaranteed an in depth story, with serious and yet sometimes even suspenseful atmosphere.This film mainly focuses on two characters, Shuya Nanahara and Noriko Nakagawa, and their story through the ordeal that they face.However, in this film you can expect to see morality, affection and humanity. For example, one friend will refuse to kill whereas others will willingly kill each other without hesitation. This also brings to light current state of mind, as we are now living in an age where adults sometimes fear the younger generations.I like this film as it is literally no holds barred, and while the gore may be up front and personal, the emotion and genuine shock that you feel when you see it diminishes the gore. Even though not every character is deeply analysed, just by a 2 minute appearance you can tell their state of mind, and how they react under pressure.I would strongly recommend seeing this film as soon as you can, as it is a genuine piece of art, with the in-depth story, the shock factors, the mixed emotion it makes you feel, and also the great soundtrack which at times kind of makes the film light hearted.a great film from an excellent director, Mr. Kinji Fukasaku",Battle Royale

Maybe at the time of release this could be regarded as ""quality media"" or maybe I've been spoilt but I wouldn't recommend anyone waste their time with this. Let's go through the list:The acting was bad
The cgi was bad

The ""hero"" somehow managed to do something ""hacker"" like in a complete Deus ex machina fashion

Pure excellence from the first shot; a crowd of reporters trying to squeeze information out of the winner of the game, a small girl covered in blood and bruises with a lingering smirk on her face. The plot of this film is simple; be the last student to survive. Each student is given a backpack full of food, water, a map, a compass and a randomly selected weapon. These weapons range from militia-type sniper rifles to everyday objects like a pot lid. Every single classmate had their own part in the making of this story. This film is shot in such a way that you end up sympathizing for more than just a select few main characters. It leaves you feeling an overall sense of loss for this ninth grade class. Overall, this film is a look at the different types of individuals and how they would respond to being put in this scenario. Among these, you have the resilient main heroes, the assassins out for themselves, the ones who choose to take their own lives instead of play the game, and the ones who are determined to live out the rest of their lives obvious to reality.

569,SebastianFaulkes,"One of my top five films, easily.",9,9 September 2005,"It may seem I am being over generous with this vote, yet something within this appeals to me on an almost sub-conscious level. As previously outlined, this is a very brave work on the part of the Fukasaku's. Not only does it physically depict children hunting and killing each other in a sadistic government sponsored game show, it makes a direct attack on Japanese culture as a whole, I believe. This can be seen by the use of Hara Hara Tokei, and actual anti-Japan movement magazine.Fans of the manga should also be pretty happy with this film adaptation, as Fukasaku has tried to keep as close to the original story as is possible on celluloid. Perhaps not as close as Miike's Ichi the Killer adaptation is, however. This aside, it is an immensely enjoyable film with plenty of storyline, political connotations and action to appease all manner of movie fans.Fukasaku's films are influenced by his childhood spent clearing bodies from the streets of Japan during the war. This perhaps justifies his use of graphic violence against children within the film, as what is depicted here can seem nothing but cartoonish in comparison to the horrors he faced as a youth. It could even be seen as a warning of getting children involved in adult affairs, as one of the most predominant themes running through the movie is youth challenging authority; the very reason the BR Act was commissioned. As Fukusaku lost his childhood to war, he warns that if children are given adult tasks too young, the Japan of tomorrow could be as seen within the film.",Battle Royale

Watching film has always been interesting for me, but a sharp turn from what is deemed "" the norm"" is what makes a film truly great. This film is the kind that you will think about when you are on the subway, or just walking through the mall like. "" Damn, that girl got messed up!"". I like the immediate psychological changes that the children are forced to undergo. In your mind, for the entire movie you must think to yourself, what would you do? Would you kill your best friend to survive the battle? Would you go crazy, lose a grip on reality, profess love to the one you had a crush on? This film reminds me of high school in that fond way, the school trips, the crushes, the groups and so forth. The way that Fukasaku makes this drop into a wild, animalistic scramble to be on top of the food chain is nothing but glorious in my mind. This is why film was made. This movie holds the essence of creative commentary on seemingly trivial things in life. Certain parts are very gory, some border on extreme, but the shock value of the imagery is what makes the film believable. Who wants to pay the ultimate price for being a friend? or a lack thereof?

I have lately been fed up with the same old American movie plots being recycled over and over. My solution has been to look into foreign films. As I speak English I started with some movies from England. I was able to enjoy many a great Brit movie, so I thought why not give some other foreign films a chance. I started mainstream, saw City of God and loved it. Then i began to look more into the Asian film genre. I really stumbled onto this movie when I was ordering some movies off ebay. I found this for a good price, read good reviews and gave it a chance. I was very pleased with my purchase. I came upon an original plot, good acting, good cinematography, great special effects and some unexpected comedy that was well timed and in good taste. The basic plot is that in a somewhat apocalyptic future children (all people under 20) have gone wild. The solution to all of these wild children, who refuse to obey the law and despise adults, is the Battle Royale act. This act states that one class of 42 children will be chosen via lottery to fight to the death on a deserted island. The last man (or woman) standing is allowed to leave if all the other students have been killed within 3 days. If they try to get smart and leave the island they are killed by explosive collars which are attached to their necks. This is an action filled flick that will keep your eyes glued to the screen throughout. The comedic part I thought was great was the teacher, be on the lookout for him and be prepared for some funny albeit sick jokes from him. I would definitely recommend that everyone who is an action fan should at least give this movie a shot. Some other foreign film recommendations I have for you are... Oldboy, Gangster No. 1, Layer Cake, The Ultimate Versus, Ong Bak, and Zatoichi.",Battle Royale

Now, I like Quentin Tarantino (for Jackie Brown & reservoir dogs) but I don't want him on a DVD that has nothing to do with him telling me how a good a movie it is when I already like it. It's like Lindsey Lohan telling me how good City of God is! I really don't care what kind of views QT has. This was the only black spot on a well packaged DVD.

As the title suggests, there will be blood. My advice: If you don't like blood, don't watch it. However, in the event that you DO like blood, Watch With Glee! You'll love this movie. There is enough blood for the term ""bloody movie"" without the blood being... too much, as it can be in some movies. In comparison to other foreign films I've seen, I like this one the best. It has a simple-to-follow plot without just pouring information into your skull all at once. It's perfect in every way.

It seems as if the screen writing has skimmed through the book and copied down the names of the characters and the concept of the book and boom! Out came the movie. The plot line in the film is not strong compared to the novel. Hardly ANY of film touched the essence and story of the original Battle Royale.The film's composition is in bad quality. In one second you are watching Mitsuko and Hirono (they do not actually fight each other in the novel)fight each other and in the next cut the picture turns into an Orange afternoon tinge, then the next cut preparing to look like a cut-on-action, the film's tint turns back to a nice clear white balance. It is understandable that mistakes are being made, but the possibility of fixing the extremely obvious mistake should have been taken cared of.The teacher, Kitano (there's no actual teacher named Kitano in the novel. There is a more menacing individual named, Sakamochi, who has SO much more character than the scratchy voiced Kitano) should not be casted. He should have just been killed in the beginning.6. Kazuo Kiriyama & 5. Shogo Kawada in the film are immediate transfer students. It would have made more sense if the two students are actually portrayed to be in the same class as 3B (it was IN THE NOVEL). Also the scene where Shuya Nanahara notices everyone is sleeping and tries to get Norika Nakagawa's cookies and then being knocked out by a woman is a complete waste of time and film feel. The bus ride would have been more convincing and stronger if they did the bus ride to the ""study trip"" as the novel, it would also convey Shogo Kawada's character and past of already playing in the game, stronger and more meaningful AND also more crazy. As Shuya starts to look around the bus, he notices Shogo trying to break open the window, Shogo falls asleep, and then Shuya drifts off as well. A short and strong clip. Instead of Shogo sitting down in a dinky medical clinic with Noriko and Shuya and babbles on about his past love and how he wants to remember her smile, it would be more interesting and connecting if Shuya asked him something similar to: ""Shogo, before everyone fell asleep, I saw you try to punch open the bus window."" THEN Shogo would tell Shuya and Noriko about how he knew it was coming and how he had already played the game. Just because flying someone in a helicopter does not convey the the special characteristics of Shogo and Kazuo. It probably would've worked with ""The Terminator"" with Arnold and the gooey-transformation-metal-morph, but NOT HERE.For those of you who are in-love with the movie, please, I am not sorry for writing this review. I am a film-maker and believe in following the novelists' storyline. I'm not Tim Burton.If you REALLY loved the movie, then pick up the Novel by Koushun Takami and read it. It is a page-turner and hahaha, trust me, you will not be bored-AT ALL!",Battle Royale
