0,MartinHafer,A perfect film.,10,30 December 2008,"Although I have so far reviewed over 5700 films, I haven't yet reviewed CASABLANCA--mostly because nothing I can say about the film can add to the many excellent and insightful reviews for this cinematic masterpiece. But, having seen it several times, I guess it's worth at least saying a few words out the film.Although Humphrey Bogart is one of the finest actors ever and he made many, many wonderful films, I think it's not much of a stretch to say this is his best performance and best film. He was perfect for the world-weary and cynical Rick. Sure, African QUEEN, THE CAINE MUTINY and several other of his films were brilliant, but none come close to CASABLANCA because in my opinion CASABLANCA is a perfect film--or about as close to one as you can find. If IMDb were not so heavily weighted in favor of newer films (just look at the top 250), it probably would be at the top of the list. For example, you can't seriously think that THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION and THE DARK KNIGHT are better films, though they both are ranked higher on the list. Now this isn't to say these are bad films--heck they are terrific,...just not in the same category as CASABLANCA.Aside from Bogart, the film also is directed perfectly by Michael Curtiz--with excellent pacing, atmosphere and charm. The supporting cast is amazing--one of the best you could find in a film. In addition to the great stock Warner Brothers character actors (such as Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Cuddles Sakall), Conrad Veidt is the perfect scary Nazi, Claude Rains is his usual wonderful self, Ingrid Bergman luminous and Paul Henreid, though a great actor, is somewhat lost among all the immense talent! Amazing music, a top script and all the style and quality that Warner Brothers could muster--this is my pick for top film ever. A fine romance and a fine film about people.",Casablanca
1,TheLittleSongbird,One of the best black and white films I have ever had the privilege of watching!,10,21 June 2009,"Casablanca is just an extraordinary film, if I had to describe it in one word, it would have to be perfection! I honestly don't care that it's an old film, I personally think that's not a convincing enough excuse for hating a film as wonderful as this , because you are seriously missing out, if you haven't seen it. The cinematography is just fantastic, with clever brooding camera-work. The music by Max Steiner is outstanding, from the sweeping haunting love theme As Time Goes By, to the excerpts of the french national anthem. The scene where everyone starts singing in the café was extraordinary and one of the many highlights of the film. The screenplay is unquestionably one of the finest in the history of cinema, right up there with Shawshank Redemption and All About Eve, containing great memorable lines such as ""seems as though Destiny is at hand"". The performances were superlative, Humphrey Bogart giving one of cinema's greatest lead performances as the ""cynical sentimentalist"" Rick Blain. Also superb are Ingrid Bergman who positively lights up the screen as Ilsa, the young woman who breaks his heart, Paul Henreid as the fugitive husband, and Claude Rains as Captain Renault. The plot is a little complicated, but I couldn't help being impressed with the performances and the screenplay. Not to mention a timeless love story that I don't think has ever been topped. Overall, a masterpiece, that quite rightly received an academy award for best picture. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Casablanca
2,bkoganbing,".....it's still the same old story, a fight for love and glory, a case of do or die, the world will always welcome lovers, As Time Goes By.""",10,8 March 2006,"It's one of the great Hollywood legends how George Raft helped make Humphrey Bogart a leading man by turning down in succession, High Sierra, The Maltese Falcon, and Casablanca. Maybe Raft showed some good sense in letting a better actor handle those roles. In any event we've got some proof in the case of Casablanca.Check out some time a film called Background to Danger that Warner Brothers did with George Raft that also featured Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet. Had Raft ever done Casablanca the film would have been a routine action/adventure story just like Background to Danger. Instead with Bogey we get that, but also one of the great love stories of the century. Humphrey Bogart set the standard for playing expatriate American soldiers of fortune in Casablanca. Right now he's between wars running Rick's Cafe Americain in Casablanca in Morocco, an area controlled for the moment by the Vicky French government. He's got his fingers in a whole lot of pies, but Bogey operates with his own code of ethics. He sticks his neck out for nobody.Nobody except the great love of his life Ingrid Bergman who left him mysteriously in Paris as he was fleeing the oncoming German occupation. She walks back into his life with a husband, Paul Henreid who is a well known anti-fascist leader.The rest of the film is a contest for Bogey's soul. Torn between his great love, his own anti-fascist beliefs, and certain practical necessities of operating a liquor and gaming establishment in a hostile environment. So many things combine to make Casablanca the great film it is. Ingrid Bergman's lovely incandescence melding and melting Bogey's cynical screen persona. The indelible characterizations of Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt and the whole rest of a 100% perfectly cast film. And the revival of a great ballad which serves as Casablanca's theme song.I say revival because As Time Goes By was introduced in 1931 in the George White Scandals on Broadway by Rudy Vallee. He made a record of it which sold quite a few disks back then. But by the merest of coincidences there was a strike that lasted two years that just began around the time Casablanca came out. The Musicians Union struck against the record companies. With no new records being made RCA Victor re-released Vallee's record and it became a monster hit on revival.Also when Casablanca came out as if the White House had a personal interest in the film FDR and Churchill had the first of their wartime conferences in----Casablanca of all places. Jack Warner must have said a prayer for that to happen.There are so many classic scenes and lines from Casablanca you can write a comment just by listing them. But my favorite has always been when the Germans have taken over Rick's place and are singing some of their songs, Paul Henreid goes to orchestra leader and asks him to lead La Marsellaise. With a nod from Bogey, the orchestra plays, Henreid leads them and the rest of the non-Germans in the cafe join in. Over 60 years later, one still gets a thrill from that act of defiance.Bogart and Rains were nominated for Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor. Any of the others could have been as well. As I said before Casablanca is perfectly cast right down to minor roles like Curt Bois as a pickpocket, John Qualen as a fellow resistance leader, and S.Z. Sakall as a waiter at Rick's. If there was an award for ensemble cast, Casablanca would have won it. As it was it did win for Best Picture of 1943 and best director for Michael Curtiz.Casablanca will be seen and loved by filmgoers for generations unto infinity, as time goes by.",Casablanca
3,SnoopyStyle,Movie romanticism at its best,9,4 October 2014,"Casablanca is a desperate place during WWII. Refugees escaping the Nazis travel a back route through Casablanca to Lisbon and then to the free world. Some can go no further than the French colony which is home to scoundrels, smugglers, double dealers, and freedom fighters. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is a world wearied expat American who runs a popular nightspot Rick's. He sticks his neck out for nobody. Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains) leads the local police. He's eager to catch the underground leader Victor Laszlo to please the Germans. Ugarte (Peter Lorre) is a sweaty people-smuggler who is selling 2 letters of transit stolen from 2 German couriers. He gives the valuable letters for Rick to hide. Much to Rick's surprise, Lazslo arrives with his old flame Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman).It's hard to quantify everything that is so great about this movie. Bogie as the Rick is one of those movie icons that transcends even the movie world. The desperation is well projected. This is melodrama of the highest order and the best of the genre. Sometimes movies come along at the right time. This is a propaganda film at the perfect time where the theme of sacrifice hit hardest. This is the standard bearer for movie romanticism as much as Romeo and Juliet for plays. Some can complain about Paul Henreid's stiffness as Laszlo but that's the point of his character. Some others can complain about the effects but that's missing the point of the movie entirely. Some can complain about all the clichés, and I agree that this movie is one big cliché. So what? In the end, this is a movie that deserves every bit of its iconic status.",Casablanca
4,Hitchcoc,One of our most quotable movies,10,9 March 2006,"Not only have countless responders talked about this film; geniuses of the film criticism have picked it apart. Like so many of my most highly rated films, it's all about character. Someone said that modern film audiences don't see it as a classic. I love all kinds of movies. I am disappointed much more with contemporary films than older ones because filmmakers were forced to us a lot more imagination. Granted, there are many bad films in every era as well as great ones. When I see every reviewer start with an evaluation of special effects. Why is it that so many films need to rely on special effects. This movie is a romance of the highest order. It asks so much of its stars. The incredible lighting that accentuates the faces of the characters makes it all work. Then you have real stars in Bogie and Bergmann. Todays actors are so bland and interchangeable for the most part. There was a reason for a star system. Even today, I want to see the less glamorous actors: Hackman, Eastwood, etc. When Bergmann is on the screen, there is no one who can show the passion and pain that she does. Also, consider the vignettes concerning war embattled Casablanca. There is a force at work to destroy all that is good and right. The singing of the French national anthem is antithetical to that scene in Cabaret where the young Nazis sing ""The World Belongs to Me."" See this if you never have.",Casablanca
5,Horst_In_Translation,"A pretty decent film that gets better towards the end, but hardly a classic",6,8 March 2020,"""Casablanca"" is an American black-and-white film from 1942, so this one is already almost 80 years old and it was directed by Michael Curtiz. He won an Oscar for his effort there and the movie also took home the big prize, namely Best Picture. Another win was for the screenplay and three writers received a trophy there, even if we have a total of 7 writers listed here on imdb because this movie is based on a play. The actors and a few other nominees managed ""only"" nominations, but no wins. The year was 1942 like I already said, so of course World War II was a huge issue and this was a truly contemporarily relevant movie. Maybe this is why many mistook it for a great movie. It is not bad by any definition, but it is also certainly not the classic many people say it is. The subject here is also fairly unusual for a war movie and I cannot really remember any other film that focused primarily on the issue of people getting visas in order to be able to leave Europe/Africa and get to the United States where war hadn't arrived yet. Maybe this uniqueness in terms of subject is another reason why many people like it. We don't get military action or Holocaust stories (obviously because the entire mess was not known at that point yet) here, but something else. As for the cast: The lead actor here was Humphrey Bogart. He was okay overall, but not good enough for an Oscar nomination I'd say. I am glad Ingrid Bergman did not get any because she really was mostly forgettable here and honestly her scenes with Bogart were not the best the film had to offer, but maybe the worst, so it is really bizarre how some talk about this being the biggest romance story ever. If it really was this big, she would not have left him behind (twice!) and he would not agree that it is the right thing to do towards the end. The only solid moment there was when he said that now they have Paris again because he knows her real motivation for letting him go. Actually, I like the idea of this motivation in the sense of a greater cause, even if it is of course debatable if it makes sense that the two split up although they have major feelings for each other, which clearly she does not have for the Hungarian fella. There were at least two occasions when he says he loves her, but she does not say the same back. As for the cast, the second Oscar nomination went to Claude Rains, one of the most influential supporting actors of his time. He was okay too I'd say, but again not good enough for an Oscar nomination. I guess many mistook his surprising twist at the end (when he helps Bogart's character after seeming more like an antagonist all the way before that) for a great performance. But surprising does not equal sublime. His nomination was probably more about the writing than really about the portrayal. And of course that he was a good guy eventually. I must also say something about him becoming good did not make sense entirely. I can see why he was not too angry at Bogart's character for the fact that he let him not have the Bulgarian girl (by the way how did he even know the roulette numbers?), but he says earlier that they have not decided yet if a prisoner committed suicide or was killed while trying to flee (implying murder), which shows that he is definitely one of the bad guys, even if he is not German. The one who is German here is actor Conrad Veidt and his character was pretty much the main antagonist, even if he did not have too much screen time. Really sad how Veidt died shortly after this film was made at a relatively young age. He could have head a great career in Hollywood ahead of him. I think he was sublimely talented. Another (somewhat) German actor here was Peter Lorre. Many people immediately think of ""M"" when they hear his name, but they do not remember he was in here too and he plays a victim once again. I think his character is a Spaniard? With the black hair it kinda works. Luckily he lives on for a while afterwards. The supporting players are all pretty good here, for example also Sydney Greenstreet, who was nominated for an Oscar too the year this came out, so a fairly impressive cast for sure. It surprises me that Rains is the one we are supposed to believe stood out.Well, I would not include Lebeau there. She was featured early on only, really early on, to basically show us how all the women love Bogart's character despite (or because of) his shenanigans, but she added nothing. And I already said that I did not like Bergman one bit here either, so this is not a film at all that shows us great character writing for females back then. Also kinda telling when we see how Bogart's character acts towards women and I am the last person who would say something like that if it wasn't entirely true. Snowflakes must melt. Anyway, what else can I say about this one here? I personally felt that it needed a little while to get going and draw me in with the action. I still was not too big on the overall plot, but preferred individual scenes and moments instead, even if some of these scenes also did not make a huge amount of sense. The best example is the shooting at the end. Are we really supposed to believe absolutely nobody saw who pulled the trigger? Oh well, still a good scene, one of the better. There are many other scenes. I liked the Ugarte/Lorre moments. The flashback scenes in Paris were fine too. The two epic quotes of course (""We'll always have Paris."" and the recurring ""Here's looking at you, kid."", which did not become remotely memorable before the second mention). The scenes with the Black musician were fine as well, even if I must say I am not too amazed by how they treated him, especially Bogart's character. Here and there, we also get an ounce of comedy in this otherwise pretty serious movie and that stems from a pickpocket doing his job. Then there is of course the lengthy sequence with the Bulgarian girl and her lover that was supposed to show us what a good guy Bogart's character really is. Annina is her name. And by the way, she is already living evidence of how the quote that there was never a more beautiful woman than Bergman's character coming to Casablanca is complete nonsense. Oh yeah, another scene I really adored was the big spectacular music scene. This clash between German traditional music and the French anthem was one of the most powerful moments of the movie and showed the resistance against the Nazis in a pretty interesting fashion. Speaking of the music, the film's soundtrack was also nominated for an Oscar and the one who came up with it (Max Steiner) won several Oscars in his career, already had 2 by then and many many more nominations and you can see from the title he was also German (well, Austrian to be exact), but it shows how many German-speaking people were a part of this film, from both cast and crew, and of course all of them are people who had turned their back on Hitler by then. Okay, I guess this should be all then. I enjoyed the watch overall after the film gained pace and the first rather weak 30 minutes were over. So I certainly recommend checking it out and I give it a thumbs-up. You can surely have a pretty decent time seeing this one. Just don't think you will be in for something truly extraordinary because otherwise your great expectations here could end up unfulfilled. Just enjoy it for what it is!",Casablanca
6,Prismark10,Casablanca,10,4 October 2020,"Writer and story consultant Robert McKee regards Casablanca as the perfect screenplay. Something he deconstructs in his famous 3 day film screenwriting seminars.In the late 1980s I saw McKee giving his insights on Casablanca on British television. He broke down the beats of a scene from Casablanca when Rick and Ilsa meet in the bazaar where she is looking at some lace. The dialogue is full of subtext and hidden meanings.McKee points out the costume both characters are wearing clothes that included stripes. The setting in the bazaar with some rods above the characters look like prison bars.It shows that both characters were soul mates, somehow bound together. The bars also implied that both of them were also destined to remain apart.It was the first time I realised that costumes and set design even in what initially looked like a mundane scene is not something random. The positioning of the actors on the screen to even shadows that fall on the characters can mean something.The weird thing about the screenplay for Casablanca was that the script was being rewritten as the movie was being made.I have seen Casablanca through the years. It has sizzling lines that are so quotable. it has been imitated so often and misquoted. It has been parodied for decades and the basic premise has been redone many times. Just look at Sydney Pollack's Havana from 1990 that shows what happens if you do not get the script or the chemistry between the actors right.I just watch movies for enjoyment purposes. In my latest viewing of Casablanca during the Covid pandemic of 2020. I found myself gaining more insights. At a time where some people were stranded abroad as flights suddenly got cancelled or had to quarantine and then look for ways to scramble back home. I sympathized with people in the movie who were stuck in Casablanca looking for exit visas to get to Lisbon and then onwards to America.As the film is set before the USA entered the second world war. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) the cynical, world weary bar owner and American ex pat is basically a metaphor for American isolationism. He cares for himself and his piano player Sam. Rick does not want to get involved with other people's problems. People can visit his bar, drink, gamble and conduct business but just do not ask him for any favours.Blaine gets possession of some stolen letters of transit. Soon two more people arrive in Casablanca looking for a way to escape Europe. Notorious underground resistance leader Victor Laszlo and his companion Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman). Ilsa was Rick's former love in Paris, the one that left him with a broken heart and his idealism in ruins.Rick has been warned by the local police chief Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains) not to aid Laszlo to escape. Renault wants to stay sweet with the Nazi officer Strasser.The movie is really a bittersweet love story between Rick and Ilsa. In a way her reappearance sees a thawing of Rick's cold heart. He makes a choice to be noble and make sacrifices. In 1942 this amounts to the USA entering the second world war.Apart from the cracking dialogue the movie has memorable but shady characters and lots of humour. Renault is the standout, the corrupt police chief who moves where the wind blows but secretly as his own side. Then there are two members of the cast who followed Bogart from The Maltese Falcon. Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet.The film might now look cliched because it has been done so many times. Just imagine for over 40 years every major film studio has booked McKee to do his 3 day course and deconstruct Casablanca. You must remember this, the movie still stands the test of time.",Casablanca
7,claudio_carvalho,The Most Beautiful Movie of the Cinema History Ever,10,21 December 2007,"In 1942, in World War II, Casablanca is the escape route to America for a few wealthy or influential people and limbo for many others that wait for a chance to raise money and get a visa. The expatriated American and former idealistic rebel Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) owns the Rick's Cafe Americain, the most famous nightclub and casino in the French Morocco's town. Rick is a bitter and cynical man that neither drinks with costumers nor involves with women, and does not stick his neck out for anyone, keeping a neutral political position in times of war. Rick has a good relationship with the corrupt French Chief of Police Captain Renault (Claude Rains), who is bribed to cover the existence of Rick's casino and protect the place. When two German messengers are killed and the valuable letters of transit in their possession are stolen, the Nazi Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt) arrives in Casablanca seeking the document and the Czechoslovakian leader of the European resistance Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). The Germans believe Viktor will try to buy the letters of transit and escape to America. Meanwhile Rick's acquaintance Ugarte (Peter Lorre) asks him to keep the letters of transit for a couple of hours, but is captured and killed by the police and the Germans. Later Victor arrives in the Rick's Cafe with his wife Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), and when she sees the piano player Sam (Dooley Wilson), she asks him to play and sing ""As Time Goes By"". When the upset Rick complains with Sam for playing the forbidden song, he sees Ilsa and recalls their romantic moments in Paris and the wound in his heart when Ilsa does not leave the town with him without any explanation.""Casablanca"" is the most beautiful movie of the cinema history ever and the number one of my preference. I do not know how many times I have watched ""Casablanca"", but since the first time I have fallen in love for Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart and they became my favorite actress and actor. Further, I feel myself emotionally affected every time that I see this film, maybe expecting Rick to stay with Ilsa in the end. But Rick's sacrifice for love is certainly one of the reasons that made ""Casablanca"" an unforgettable masterpiece, maybe the most romantic film ever made. The sequence in Rick's Cafe with the French costumers singing La Marseillaise causes goose flesh on me  imagine in French people! The wonderful romance is disclosed through a magnificent screenplay, with memorable and witty dialogs, perfect development of the characters and the geopolitical situation of Casablanca in 1942 in a dramatic environment of war and a stunning chemistry of the leading couple. The direction of Michael Curtiz is amazing, using closes, shadows and exploring the talent of the cast at their best with the support of an awesome black and white cinematography. The music-theme is among the most well-known in the world. In the end, ""Casablanca"" is the perfect movie, and Rick and Ilsa will live forever together in my heart. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Casablanca""",Casablanca
8,classicsoncall,"""Everybody comes to Rick's.""",10,5 October 2005,"""Casablanca"" has been my favorite movie for the past thirty years, and each annual viewing further cements that standing. For me, it's the perfect film, with perfect characters, locales, action, romance and dialog. In fact, it is the most quoted movie ever, including a line that was never even uttered (Play it again, Sam).It's hard to imagine that during the studio days of the 1940's, ""Casablanca"" was just one more movie being pumped out a week at a time by Warner Brothers. The story itself, based on a stage play ""Everybody Comes to Rick's"" went through continuous rewrites, even as filming was under way. Fortunately, the vision of a handful of gifted artists ultimately found it's way on screen, with a cast as colorful and star studded as any before or since. Even the music, composed for the film by Max Steiner is perfect, dominating the Paris flashback scenes of Rick and Ilsa's fleeting romance.Now picture if you will, the original contenders for the three acting leads in the film; Dennis Morgan for Victo Laszlo, Ann Sheridan for Ilsa Lund, and George Raft or Ronald Reagan for the part of Rick Blaine. If that had actually occurred, the result may well have wound up in obscurity, but instead, Warner Brothers went out of their way to hire on Ingrid Bergman, on loan from David Selznick in return for Olivia DeHaviland. For the part of Victor Laszlo, Warner signed up Paul Henreid who was under contract to RKO Pictures. Coming off a successful on screen collaboration in ""The Maltese Falcon"", Humphrey Bogart as Rick was once again supported by Peter Lorre as the scheming Ugarte, and Sydney Greenstreet as the conniving owner of the rival gambling joint, ""The Blue Parrot"". Rounding out the major film credits, Conrad Veidt successfully sneers his way into Rick's world as Nazi General Major Strasser; and for sheer delight in a characterization, there's none to equal Claude Rains' portrayal of Prefect of Police Captain Reinault. Rick and Ilsa may have always had Paris, but Rick and Reinault have always had Casablanca.The ultimate outcome of the film was not known during early film production in May of 1942. It was not until brothers Julius and Philip Epstein, brought in for their humorous wit, both got their inspiration in a single moment while driving down Sunset Boulevard - ""Round up the usual suspects"". Cleverly interjecting the elimination of the hated villain Strasser by the film's hero, the film successfully answers the question of who gets the girl. Ilsa, in love with one man but devoted to the cause of another, must resign herself to the fate entrusted to Rick the night before - ""You have to think for both of us, for all of us"".Even world events conspired to help ""Casablanca"" achieve it's unparalleled success. Originally to be released in June 1943, Warner Brothers' dedication to the war effort was matched by the Allied landing in North Africa in November 1942, in Casablanca. Shortly after on Thanksgiving Day 1942, the film opened in New York following a wildly enthusiastic pre-screening. And in a well timed follow up, the general release date of January 23, 1943 coincided with a conference between President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill in Casablanca.""Casablanca"" cemented Humphrey Bogart's reputation as a romantic leading man, and made Ingrid Bergman a very popular star. Though each would continue on in highly successful careers, they would not appear in another film together, and that's probably for the best. Both artists achieved their master work in ""Casablanca"", and how do you top a perfect?",Casablanca
9,gavin6942,Classic Film at Its Best,9,18 February 2010,"In Casablanca, Morocco, during World War II, there is a place called Rock's run by an American where fugitives can meet safely and enjoy a refreshing drink and soothing music. Think of it as a 1940s Mos Eisley Cantina, if you will. And at the center of it all? Rick, played by Humphrey Bogart.It really goes without saying that this film is a classic, and probably one of the most famous and highly acclaimed films ever, as well as being Humphrey Bogart's biggest role. It is quotable, the scenes have been emulated or parodied scores of times... what more can I say that hasn't been said over the last sixty-odd years? So, I will say two things: one, this film loses nothing to time. Despite being a clear period piece (filmed during WWII and taking place as a war film, sort of) it resonates just as strongly today with audiences as it did the first day. And also, it exceeded my expectations. Surely I thought it would be good. But often when films (or anything, really) have something of a legendary status, the hype is difficult to match. ""Casablanca"" matched the hype and at times went above and beyond. From the opening scene with the spinning globe, I knew this was going to be the next step in film history -- perhaps ""Casablanca"" is the first modern film?",Casablanca
10,lee_eisenberg,"Here's lookin' at you, film.",10,28 November 2005,"Overall, ""Casablanca"" went a little overboard on being pro-American, but certain traits make it worthwhile. The plot of course has American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) owning a Cafe Americain in WWII-era Casablanca and meeting ex-lover Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman).Much of the film's strength lies in its dialogue. Rick says ""I don't stick my neck out for nobody."" Alone, this helps the audience understand what kind of a person he is, but the movie also shows his other side. When Ilsa comes to the café, Sam (Dooley Wilson) tells her ""A lot of water been under the bridge."" This alone is enough to describe not only Rick and Ilsa's life, but also the events that had come to dominate the world during the past few years.As for the other characters, Paul Henreid plays Ilsa's husband Victor Laszlo. Even though he has been fighting the Nazis, one wonders how much value he has in life. Capt. Renault (Claude Rains) is amoral but we grow to respect him. Conrad Veidt, Peter Lorre, and Sydney Greenstreet also provide great characters. All in all, ""Casablanca"" remains the embodiment of the phrase: ""They don't make 'em like they used to.""",Casablanca
11,jboothmillard,Casablanca,8,11 July 2005,"I have seen this enough times to have the same opinion every time, it could be a little better, nevertheless I did see this film featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, from Oscar winning director Michael Curtiz (The Adventures of Robin Hood, Mildred Pierce). Basically, set in World War II, many Europeans are trying to get into America to escape the threat of the Germans, but to do that they have to go to Casablanca, Morocco and get a visa. A hot spot in the town is Rick's Cafem run by American exile Rick Blaine (Oscar nominated Humphrey Bogart), who is shocked to see his past lover Ilsa Lund (Ingrib Bergman) walk into his place. He has a flashback about what he and Ilsa used to get up to when they were in love, and now she is married after running away to Paris. He has other problems however, Ugarte (Peter Lorre) has given him important transit letters, Nazi officer Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt) is snooping around, and police Captain Renault (Claude Rains) tries to make the Nazi happy detaining Czech underground leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). In the end, to save her husband's life, Rick forces Ilsa to board a plane leaving the country, the letters are given to the right people, and when Rick looked like he was going to be in trouble he was saved by his new friend. Also starring Sydney Greenstreet as Signor Ferrari, S.Z. Sakall as Carl, Madeleine Lebeau as Yvonne and Dooley Wilson as Sam. I personally think that this film is a little overrated, Bogart is really good, Bergman is beautiful and the supporting cast all do good too, and the score is great. My concern is that the only thing I will ever remember are the memorable catchphrases and little love story in amongst everything else which I find a little confusing and too political, but it's not a bad film at all, it is a classic wartime romantic drama to see. It won the Oscars for Best Writing, Screenplay and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing and Best Music for Max Steiner. It was on 100 Years, 100 Quotes at number 67 (""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.""), number 43 (""We've always got Paris.""), number 32 (""Round up all the suspects.""), number 28 (""Play it, Sam.

It's too subjective but if I forced to cast a vote, I would give this the most serious consideration. I mean, what aspect of this film isn't top-notch?The dialog is superb, one of the best ever put on film. The acting is great, cinematography first-rate and the story offers an interesting mix of drama, action, romance, music...you name it. This film has everything but color, which might prohibit of a lot of younger folks from ever checking this classic out. That would be a shame because film- making doesn't get much better than ""Casablanca.""All of this doesn't mean it's my favorite film of all-time. It isn't even in my top ten but I always find it very, very enjoyable and the latest 2-disc DVD transfer makes it even better to view.Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, of course, are the stars but I always found Claude Raines' character the best to watch. His witty dialog as the police chief always makes me smile. He has many clever lines and isn't a guy you can figure out. He and Bogart's character are similar, essentially coming across as people who only care about themselves but deep inside are good-hearted people.The ending is much discussed and very famous and helps make the movie so revered. There has been so much written about this film that there I won't add more except to make one negative statement but that's about a line in the story and not a reflection on the quality of the film. I wasn't impressed that Bergman, despite being married, was willing to run off with Bogart, claiming she ""doesn't know"" what's right or wrong! Are you serious? Well, judging by the marriage records of Hollywood over the years, maybe they don't know adultery just might be wrong. Anyway, other than that, this is a great movie with many, many classic scenes. Bergman never looked prettier, albeit the aid of soft lens shots on her closeups, and Bogey was never more, well, Bogey, than in here. Add Paul Henreid, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and other fine actors and wow, what a cast!An added bonus is hearing ""As Time Goes By"" throughout the film, a haunting song. Actually, there are several songs played, mainly by pianist Dooley Wilson, and they're all fun to hear. As I said, one could go on and on about this movie. 'Nuff said.",Casablanca
13,rmax304823,"Wartime Drama, Intrigue, Romance in Exotica.",5,2 September 2009,"Since no one reading these comments knows the plot, I'll outline it. Loner Humphrey Bogart runs a shady saloon and gambling house in French Morocco in 1942. The Nazis are closing in. The region is under the government of the French puppet government and is represented by Claude Raines. Bogart is wary of relationships. ""I stick my neck out for nobody."" Into his gin joint walks an old girl friend, Ingrid Bergman, and her husband. They're still in love but Bergman is bonded to her idealistic husband, a resistance hero and concentration camp escapee. Bogart is distraught. A flashback reveals that they were lovers in Paris before it was occupied by the Germans. They kiss often on the screen and it's even suggested that they had premarital intercourse. Bergman finds out that her husband is still alive and deserts Bogart without explanation. The rebuff leaves him shocked -- shocked! Back in the present, in Rick's café in Casablanca, it's revealed that Bogart has two unimpeachable passes out of Casablanca, which Bergman attempts to get from him, for use by her and her hero husband, at the point of a gun. But she can't shoot Bogart. Instead, she collapses in his arms. The scene dissolves. When the next scene fades in they are standing apart and conversing. I suspect another illicit interlude has taken place.In the end, good prevails. Bogart and Bergman sacrifice their love for the greater good.It's practically an icon of 1940s Hollywood. It has a great cast -- Bogart, Bergman, Cuddles Sakal, Claude Raines, Greenstreet and Lorre from ""The Maltese Falcon,"" Paul Henreid, John Qualen, Leonid Kinsky, Conrad Veidt from Fritz Lang's ""The Cabinet of Doctor Caligari."" It was probably the high point of Michael Curtiz's career. And it's been applauded by fans from all over the world for almost seventy years.And it's not bad, either. It's just that, to the extent that it eludes my aesthetic apparatus, I guess it's because I find it no more than an interesting but strictly routine tale of the nasty Nazis, the ambiguous French, the heroic European resistance, and the cynical and embittered American who converts to the values of the Free World at the end. Bogart was to play similar roles for the rest of his career. (Cf., ""Key Largo."")The very features of the film that are so consistently pointed to as its greatest assets I find kind of corny. Everybody quotes tag lines. ""The problems of two people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world."" ""Round up the usual suspects."" ""Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" I remember every detail of Paris. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue."" Then there's the scene in which the Free French outsing the Germans. Is that cannon fire or is it myself I hear snoring? The movie is okay for what it purports to be, a strictly commercial, patriotic effort from Warner Brothers. There's nothing to indicate the slapdash quality of the shooting itself. (At one point, Bogart had a scene in which he stood on a balcony nodding at something below, without knowing what the something was supposed to be.) I watch it more out of a sense of duty than any magnetic attraction towards an irresistible film. The schmaltz is frankly irritating. I wince, watching the tears roll down Bergman's gorgeous face, hearing Bogart's repeated, ""Here's looking at you kid."" It would be nice to think that there was more going on than what we see and hear on the surface. Somewhere between the rainy train station in Paris and the colorful desert resorts of Casablanca, couldn't Bogart have come out of the closet? Maybe he and Claude Raines were jealous of one another? Couldn't Bogart have sent Bergman off with her husband because he was more in love with his collection of ladies' undergarments? He found the local goat herds more inspiring?Anything?",Casablanca
14,Tweekums,One of the greatest films ever,10,23 July 2009,"If ever a film deserved to be considered a classic then this is it, even if you haven't seen it before you'll recognise much of the dialogue; it is probably the most quoted, and misquoted, film of all time. Humphrey Bogart is excellent in this career defining role as bar owner Rick Blaine who has come into possession of two ""letters of transit"" which guarantee the holders unhindered passage out of Casablanca. He has these as Ugarte, the man who asked him to look after them, was captured by the Vichy French police before he could get them back. Ugarte had been planning to sell the documents to Victor Laszlo, a Czech nationalist who is fleeing from Nazi occupied Europe to the United States via neutral Portugal. Things are complicated by the fact that Laszlo's wife Ilsa had a relationship with Rick before the fall of Paris and he never really got over her.Right up until the end we don't know what Rick will do, perhaps he will let Victor and Ilsa have the letters, perhaps he will let Victor have them on condition that Ilsa stays with him or perhaps he will betray Victor and leave Casablanca himself with Ilsa. Bogart isn't the only great performance; Ingrid Bergman is fantastic as Ilsa, there is a real chemistry between her and Bogart, Claude Rains is great as the French policeman who's loyalty is likely to change depending on who he thinks is likely to be the most use to him and Paul Henreid's restrained performance as Victor Laszlo is faultless too.It is hard to say what genre this film is, it is one of the great romances, it is also a war film, a thriller and even has some subtle comedy moments. Don't be put off by the film's age, the fact that it is in black and white or that it has a U certificate, this film is a must see. Whatever your tastes you owe it to yourself to watch this at least once, although I suspect few people will only want to watch it just once.",Casablanca
15,ma-cortes,The most famed for many and one of the greatest movie ever realized,8,9 November 2005,"Casablanca is deemed by many to be the biggest picture ever made and one of most famous movies of all time . It's a masterpiece produced in 1942 that was thought as a run-of-the-mill studio production . It was only afterwards which it became clear that it would be a landmark cinema . Humphrey Bogart's forty ninth film , would transform the studio contract player into a superstar and to be the first in a whole string of Warner Brothers's classics in which he would play the leading role . Producer Jack Warner assigned the Rick's role for George Raft , however Hall B. Wallis wanted to Bogart who luckily obtained the important character , but he previously played only mobster roles and afterwards romantic protagonists , besides tough main lead. It's an extremely romantic film converted in cinema history with images (Rick and Ilsa embraced) , moving scenes (final farewell in the airport) and dialogs have been used or imitated in other films, spots and television programmes .Casablanca is homaged with fascination as in ¨One from the heart¨ (by Francis Ford Coppola) or from irony as ¨Play it again Sam¨(Herbert Ross). The movie has immortal images with memorable quotes and the best scenes ever written , such as the exciting final when Bogart bids Bergman farewell at the airport with ¨Here's looking at you kid¨still has audiences choking back a tear. All film originates unforgotten characters as makes with Wilson, the piano player to whom Ingrid Bergman says : ¨play it Sam¨. Bergman is enticing and wonderful , stunningly photographed by Arthur Edeson , she was fortunate to have Orry Kelly an hugely talented designer costume to dress her. His shone as radiantly as Bergman's luminous beauty who never looked lovelier. Along with a fabulous plethora of secondaries such as : Claude Rains , Paul Henreid , Conrad Veidt , Peter Lorre , S.Z.Sakal, Madeleine Lebeau , John Qualen , Dooley Wilson , among others . And a large number of extras , as in the famous scene where the ""Marseillaise"" is sung over the German song ""Watch on the Rhine"", many of them had real tears in their eyes ; they were actual refugees and Jews who had escaped from Nazi persecution in Germany and elsewhere in Europe and were overcome by the emotions the scene brought out . The motion picture with sensitive score by Max Steiner was very well directed by Michael Curtiz . Well worth seeing for everybody and specially to the classic cinema lovers.",Casablanca
16,moonspinner55,"Great characters, classic dialogue, teary-eyed romance...",6,11 September 2007,"Humphrey Bogart in his preeminent role, that of the marvelously tough nightclub owner Rick Blaine, living in Algiers and sheltering refugee ex-girlfriend Ingrid Bergman and her new husband from the invading Nazis. Bogart is so ideally cast, the minute you see him on-screen in his white tuxedo jacket is a welcome sight. Bergman is somehow less interesting, and director Michael Curtiz keeps her crying all the time (usually in close-up), which, although appropriately tender and moving, becomes repetitive. The screenplay, reportedly the victim of frequent change on the set, is loosely structured and is often handled indifferently by Curtiz, who nevertheless stages some classic sequences, particularly the finale at the airport. But what does Rick mean by his line, ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship""? Has Ilsa's emotional devotion sworn him off women for good? Beautiful cinematography by Arthur Edeson; Max Steiner's score is used to underline everything, but Herman Hupfeld's ""As Time Goes By"" makes up for the oversell. *** from ****",Casablanca
17,Quinoa1984,a classic that's known to people long before they actually see the movie,10,26 August 2006,"For years when I was younger I thought I had seen Casablanca, but it wasn't until I was 17 that I actually SAW the entire thing from start to finish. Before that, I had seen some of the most indelible scenes from the picture (I don't remember them all, but one had Peter Lorre, another was when Bogie is drunk in the bar after the bar is closed and Bergman's Isla goes to him and he tells her off, another was, of course, the last scene). It's when one sees all of the story put together and all of those really terrfic scenes in the club that it really does gell as being a classic. It might not be up there for me with the very great films ever like Citizen Kane or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but there's never a minute, a line, or a performance in Casablanca that turns out to be dull or un-watchable. It's by turns very funny in a few spurts even though it's a romantic drama of the highest Hollywood order. For some on the level of movies dealing with loves lost and found and lost again it's no wonder that this takes the cake. Even the last scene, the lines of which have been parodied God knows how many times now, still has that ring of emotion in the greatest escapist sense. It's a must-see-once kind of movie, even if you find that you don't like the movie.And the cast is probably one of the best reasons to see it. It's really got the best crop of stars and character actors from Warner brothers and beyond. Bogart and Bergman have their spotlight on them here at full blast and they each deliver impeccable performances in roles that aren't too unexpected, but never less than stylish and dramatic. Then there's Peter Lorre, Peter Greenstreet, and of course Claude Raines who probably gives if not his most memorable performance one of his most striking. It's rare that an actor is given such a part that really fits him and still keeps a hold on the viewer so many years later. From the story intrigue and deception and danger involving the Nazis, the heroism and sacrifice that gets involved, and at the core of it- after the club which Bogie owns- is the love triangle that gets resolved in a somber way that makes for a sensational ending. In fact, it's main goal is to be sensational, and for the most part it's truly successful, from its 'a kiss is just a kiss' song to the sweet one-liners.",Casablanca
18,JohnHowardReid,One of Hollywood's Greatest!,10,27 July 2017,"If ever a movie deserved the year's most prestigious award for Best Picture, Casablanca is it! The tragedy is that Bergman was not even nominated for Best Actress, and that Bogart and Claude Rains both lost! And that Arthur Edeson was passed over for Best Photography is equally incomprehensible! Time has robbed many of the other winners and nominees (Joan Fontaine in ""The Constant Nymph""? Mickey Rooney in ""The Human Comedy""? J. Carroll Naish in ""Sahara""?) of present-day relevance, but Casablanca — the first cult movie — has undoubtedly been seen and enjoyed by a far greater audience than all the other 1943 nominations put together.What is the reason for this amazing popularity? I'd like to put it down to the picture's excellence in all departments:— its stylish, pacey direction, the enormous variety and drama of its camera set-ups, its sharp film editing and artistic lighting — not to mention its superb performances and engrossing plot. In his fascinating book Cult Movies, Danny Peary feels that audiences respond because ""Casablanca"" contains every element of ideal entertainment — ""Action, adventure, bravery, danger, espionage, exotic locale, friendship, gun-play, humor, intrigue, a love triangle, a masculine hero, a mysterious heroine, patriotism, politics (without being too political), romance, sentimentality, a theme song, a time factor, a venomous villain, and war.""Yes, Peary is absolutely on the right track. ""Casablanca: provides all these ideal qualities — and more. Rick is not only a masculine hero — but a hero with a romantic past. This is the trait that appeals to women, while men admire Rick's resourcefulness and savage wit. And, as Peary points out, there's not just a simple friendship between the Bogart and Rains characters, but a tension, a respect, a latent guiltiness for abandoned ideals. These three- dimensional characterizations make the film seem so realistic despite its preposterous plot and laughable stage devices such as the irrevocable letters of transit.Tension is what ""Casablanca"" is all about. The war-time tension of the setting, the tension of the plot, and especially the tension between the characters — not just tension in the broad sense or even tension between the principal figures in the action, but tension between just about every character in the script — between Bogart and LeBeau for instance, between Rains and Veidt, between Curt Bois and Olaf Hytten, between Rains and Joy Page, between Veidt and Sakall, between Kinsky and LeBeau, between Lorre and Bogart, between the Italians and the Germans. This is just the beginning of a list. But then you have inner tension in the characters themselves, particularly Bogart and Bergman of course, but even in minor figures like John Qualen and Dooley Wilson. Only Henreid and Veidt, who both stand for what they see as ideals, are free of any guilt or self- doubts and can be relied upon to act decisively and predictably at any given moment. This is why the climax is so effective and Veidt's action is just what we would expect. Hard to believe isn't it that a script so perfectly constructed — such a fine meshing of so many disparate elements — was the work of many hands, often working independently and (especially in the latter half of the film) in considerable haste?That's the picture business. Curtiz's control, mastery and unification of all these elements cannot be over-estimated. And he gives them class, style, polish and atmosphere as well.",Casablanca
19,tavm,Casablanca is the definite all-time movie classic!,10,22 September 2020,"Since my mom once mentioned not ever watching this from beginning to end, I thought I'd rectify that now. She loved it and I once again did. How could one not when listening to the sparkling dialogue, or seeing the great images courtesy of director Michael Curtiz who won his only Oscar for this? And of course there are all those great players starting with Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman whose only teaming on film this was and who made such a great romantic couple here. Paul Henreid as Ingrid's other leading man wasn't so bad either especially during that ""dueling anthems"" scene. Then there's Claude Rains as the French prefect whose loyalties are constantly tested for him and us. And, finally, Dooley Wilson is aces especially when singing ""As Time Goes By"". Really, I'll just now say Mom and me definitely highly recommend Casablanca and leave it at that! P.S. Since my favorite movie is It's a Wonderful Life, I have to again cite someone from that movie that's also in another one I'm reviewing.

In those years, the academy nominated 10 films. That practice would end the following year when only 5 films would receive nominations. While my favorite for 1943 was ""For Whom the Bell Tolls, I have to admit that ""Casablanca"" is a film classic which will survive throughout time to come.Humphrey Bogart was phenomenal in the role of Rick, the casino owner who finds his love Elsa, so well portrayed by Ingrid Bergman. Problem is that Elsa has married Paul Henreid, who gives another excellent performance in the tradition of ""Now, Voyager,"" which was the year before.Claude Rains is just great as the police official who knows that Rick is right in a setting with a pro-Nazi government.Who can forget the lines- PLAY IT AGAIN SAM, HERE'S TO YOU KID, LOUIE, IT'S THE START OF A BEAUTIFUL FRIENDSHIP, ROUND UP THE USUAL SUSPECTS.Made during World War 11, the film evoked much sympathy from its audiences. An oddity in the Oscar voting was while the picture and director won, Bogart and Claude Rains, the latter in a supporting role, both lost the coveted Oscar to Paul Lukas and Charles Coburn respectively. Bergman was not nominated here but did snag a nomination that year for ""For Whom the Bell Tolls.""Casablanca has always been a sight for intrigue in motion pictures.

21,Coventry,"Here's looking at cinema-perfection, kid",10,16 February 2004,"Out of all the films that are considered classic milestones in cinemahow many fully deserve that status?? Not that many, let me tell youbut Casablanca absolutely does! Casablanca has become history itself, a legendary production that'll live on forever. And it should! This film is essential viewing for everyone who ever showed interest in cinema. Every sequence in Casablanca is brilliant, every character is intriguing and every setting is breath taking. Especially when you're watching it for the first timeyou'll be surprised how much you actually know about it already. Multiple ideas, lines and sequences were so influential and important to cinema, that they have been used numberless times afterwards. You might even say that cinema would have looked completely different if it wasn't for Casablanca. It's a brilliant love-story with irresistible film-noir and comedy aspects. The entire script - line by line - is pure nostalgic and some of the dialogues originally shown here grew out to become pure historical art. This intelligent movie also depends a lot on its superb cast, of course. Bogart portrays a terrific character herea performance that yet has to find its equal. His brute and heartless portrayal of Rick is fascinating, especially because you soon find out that he is in fact just a hurt romanticist, heart-broken by a girl who's about to show up again. This girl (the stunning Ingrid Bergman) is practically the most marvelous lady who ever appeared on the big screen. Thanks to her natural charm and beauty, Bergman makes the most out of Ilsa. Film-noir stars Claude Rains and Peter Lorre supply the film with terrific supporting characters and a right amount of humor and parody. It's amazing how this film combines so many different genres successfully. The cruelty and drama of the war and the rise of the 'Third Empire' is mixed with comedy and romance in a unique way. It cannot be deniedCasablanca is pure perfection and everyone should appreciate it. This film isn't to be missed by anyone, whether you're young, middle-aged or retiredthis film will move you.",Casablanca
22,sunwarrior13,One Of The Most Beloved Film,10,17 January 2012,"One of the most beloved American films, this captivating wartime adventure of romance and intrigue from director Michael Curtiz defies standard categorization. Simply put, it is the story of Rick Blaine, a world-weary ex-freedom fighter who runs a nightclub in Casablanca during the early part of World War II.Casablanca is a romantic drama film directed by Curtiz that features Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid, and featuring Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre and Dooley Wilson. Set during Second World War, it focuses on a man torn between, in the words of one character, love and virtue. He must choose between his love for a woman and helping her and her Czech Resistance leader husband escape from the Vichy-controlled Moroccan city of Casablanca to continue his fight against the Nazis.Despite pressure from the local authorities, notably the crafty Capt. Renault, Rick's cafe has become a haven for refugees looking to purchase illicit letters of transit which will allow them to escape to America. One day, to Rick's great surprise, he is approached by the famed rebel Victor Laszlo and his wife, Ilsa, Rick's true love who deserted him when the Nazis invaded Paris. She still wants Victor to escape to America, but now that she's renewed her love for Rick, she wants to stay behind in Casablanca. ""You must do the thinking for both of us,"" she says to Rick. He does, and his plan brings the story to its satisfyingly logical, if not entirely happy, conclusion. Despite a changing assortment of screenwriters frantically adapting an unstaged play and barely keeping ahead of production, and Bogart attempting his first romantic lead role, Casablanca won three Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Its characters, dialogue, and music have become iconic, and the film has grown in popularity to the point that it now consistently ranks near the top of lists of the greatest films of all time.An undisputed masterpiece and perhaps Hollywood's quintessential statement on love and romance, it has only improved with age, boasting career-defining performances from Bogart and Bergman. It has a peculiar magic to it, and it's in the richness of its details that mostly go unnoticed because of the film's pace.Despite of being released in 1942,the appeal of Casablanca shows no sign of diminishing as time goes by.",Casablanca

24,hitchcockthelegend,You must remember this...,10,19 September 2009,"Are my eyes really brown?Casablanca is one of those films that needs no introduction - or in truth - any more in-depth dissection as to its worth. Over the years it has become one of the most quoted ever pictures (sometimes wrongly), and in reality it's arguably more iconic than it is a work of art. Although a truly ""A"" list production for 1942, fact is nobody in and around the film expected it to be anything other than a good piece that will put bums on the seats in the theatres. Solidly received on release and riding in on the wave of the Allies inroads into North Africa, Casablanca steadily overcame the much discussed production troubles (the script was practically rewritten daily) to be where it is now, one of the most loved film's of all time.I wouldn't mention Paris, it's poor salesmanship!So what is it about Casablanca that makes it so cherished and adored by each and every generation?. I just know that each time I view it (yearly) it's like falling in love again, each viewing brings a new and emotionally driven fulfilment. Tears flow, sad ones and happy ones, an overriding feeling that romantic idealism isn't dead, to which Casablanca becomes my personal myth buster. Thematic redemption brings a joyous reward, even as our daydreams about lost chances and lost loves hangs heavy in and around Rick's Café Américain. Everything about Casablanca is right, from the flawless direction (Michael Curtiz) to the iconic music, and of course the magnificent characters that are brought to life by the incredibly tight and effective cast. It may not be the greatest film of all time, but to me, and those who let it into their lives, it's one of the best friends anyone could ever hope to have. 10/10",Casablanca
25,Theo Robertson,I'm A Cynic So What I Say Doesn't Matter,7,5 May 2014,"Once in a while you find yourself stumbling upon a film whose reputation precedes it . It doesn't matter what anyone on this site or out in the wider world says about it . CASABLANCA is a case in point . Anything I or anyone else writers here is entirely superfluous because any insight has already been said and anyone saying anything negative is instantly considered a contrition merely for the sake of it . CASABLANCA is cinematic legend . End of . It should be noted however that despite being broadcast on a relatively regular basis in the 1970s on British television it hasn't appeared very often in recent years . It might be wrong to point out that it was a mainstay in the top ten of the IMDb top 250 but nowadays it's sliding down the list as more people are exposed to it and perhaps think its legendary status isn't as deserved as it could have been . Perhaps I too belong to that camp The reputation means so many people have actually forgotten what the film is about . Slightly patriotic flag waver where the forces of democracy get one over on the vile Nazis , slightly romantic pot boiler , and very much redemption plot it's a film that does have a feelgood factor . The story revolves around Rick , an embittered cynic who is only interested in profiting from the war and as events turn out he's about to discover that there's somethings far more important than money . Everything could have been done a little bit better especially when you consider Michael Curtiz is very much a contender for best film director of the 20th Century who made a lot of differing genre films and was always very good at what he did . His problem was that his films weren't marketed for a bitterly cynical audience in the 21st Century and seem a little bit too old fashioned when seen today . That said the up side is you enjoy classic Hollywood with its emphasis on stardom , dialogue and feel good factor there's a lot to admire in CASABLANCA but you have go in to it with the certain knowledge that it's not quite the masterwork its legendary reputation suggests it is That is the main problem with Michael Curtiz in general and CASABLANCA in particular . A film like ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES doesn't contain one single scene or line of dialogue that can be classed as realistic in anyway and a film like that which has lines such as "" Okay fellas let's say a prayer for a kid who couldn't run as fast as me "" would see pop corn and drinks thrown at the screen in 2014 .

Michael Curtiz's film is a curious one. It enjoys presently perhaps more popularity than when it originally made its debut in 1942. As new generations discovered the picture, they made it a timeless film, and generations to come will also be charmed by it.The story of Rick and Ilsa and their impossible love affair will be something to be treasured by film lovers forever. Casablanca in the 40s was a hot bed of intrigue; lots of people tried to get there, but perhaps leaving the place was harder because the red tape of that era and the fact that the Nazis had a way to spoil a party. In a lot of ways, this is a dated film. By today standards it would be politically incorrect. But ultimately, we all fall under the spell that Michael Curtiz created and for almost two hours we are in Casablanca among the spies and would be travelers eavesdropping into their conversations and the different schemes going on.Humphrey Bogart was an actor without the looks of some of the handsome male stars of that era, yet, he is mesmerizing as Rick Blaine. It would be hard to imagine another actor playing Rick other that Bogart. Ingrid Bergman was at the height of her career when she made the film. Her chemistry with her co star is one of the best things going, since they made it believable.The rest of the cast is flawless. Paul Henreid, as Victor Lazlo, cuts quite a figure and it is hard to think Ilsa would prefer Rick to this suave and sophisticated man. Claude Rains is good as Capt. Renault. Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, S.K.

They need the letters to escape from the Nazis who are slowly getting in...but will Rick give them up? This movie is well made, beautifully directed and has some of the most quotable lines in movie history--""I stick my neck out for nobody""; ""Play it Sam"" (NOT play it again Sam); ""The Germans wore gray, you wore blue""; ""We'll always have Paris""; ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine""; ""Here's looking at you kid""; ""Round up the usual suspects"" and ""Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"". We also have Dooley Wilson playing and singing the haunting ""As Time Goes By"". The acting is superb across the board right down to the supporting performances-- Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet and Claude Rains are at their best.BUT I find the story somewhat confusing and there are some huge loopholes if you examine the movie closely.

28,CinemaSerf,Timeless classic,8,15 September 2020,"I've just seen this on a big screen for the first time in over thirty years - no enhancements, 4K, HD - just as Michael Curtiz saw it back in 1942 and it's a cracking piece of cinema. ""Rick Blaine"" (Humphrey Bogart) runs his Casablanca café as a literal oasis in the North African desert - a refuge for all sorts fleeing the oppression of the Nazis in nearby Europe. Enter ""Ilsa"" (Ingrid Bergman) and her husband, a Czech resistance leader ""Hector Lazlo"" (Paul Henried) and we discover that ""Rick"" and her have a past, and when the pursuing ""Maj. Strasser"" (Conrad Veidt) and local police chief Claude Rains (""Capt. Renault"") get involved in this cocktail of deceit and duplicity things gradually come to the boil in a wonderfully evocative, sophisticated fashion. Bogart and Bergman positively smoulder; the chemistry is electric - she, as usual, doesn't actually act - she is just herself, and that's all she needs to do. Rains is great as the conniving policeman as is Veidt delivering the rather sparse, but no less potent, dialogue perfectly. Like most of the best films, the key to this is it's (seemingly effortless) simplicity - and this one also has a wonderful musical score to complement the tensely directed, eerily shot, story augmented by an hugely talented supporting cast with the likes of Peter Lorre and the superbly sleazy Sydney Greenstreet. There was a great deal wrong and inhibiting with the ""studio system"" that prevailed at the time, but when it did work it could pull together an astonishing collection of people in front of, and behind the camera and create masterpieces like this.",Casablanca
29,writers_reign,As Time Goes By ...,10,22 February 2007,"... it totally fails to dim or tarnish this Golden movie which is, in its own way, as iconic as Citizen Kane it's near contemporary (they were released in subsequent years). Like any film fan worthy of the name I've seen it around a dozen times in re-runs and on TV and I have owned the DVD since it became available but it's a joy to see it once again - and digitally remastered with it - in its natural habitat, the big screen as it is re-released yet again and I'm particularly pleased that it marks my 800th Review on IMDb.When one just thinks about it what springs to mind is how it gives the lie to those muppets who keep insisting that Film is a 'Visual' medium because it's nothing if not a continuous string of quotable lines, arguably the most of any other movie in the English language but when one SEES it again it is, in fact, a combination of dialogue and visuals. The opening sequence alone is a Masterclass in screen writing and sets up virtually everything we need to know about the subsequent events. Equally accomplished is our introduction to Rick whose opening dialogue/action confirms what we have been told about him. Another telling visual is the way Claude Rains straightens his tie when informed that there is 'another visa problem' outside his office and his 'show her in' tells us everything we need to know about him making his line to Rick 'make it ten thousand francs, I'm only a poor corrupt official', superfluous. Note also the close ups of Bogie, Bergman and Paul Henreid in the penultimate scene at the airport, conveying more than words can about this bittersweet triangle. I could go on - indeed, I'm tempted to - but I have a feeling it's all been said before and almost certainly will be again and all I can do is envy anyone who has still to see it for the first time.",Casablanca
30,zardoz-13,"""Casablanca"" Deserves Cinematic Immortality!",10,15 June 2008,"What can anybody say about this classic film that hasn't been said? Okay, it isn't my favorite World War II Warner Brothers film, but it is a grand movie. Yes, ""Casablanca"" is worth watching, and I've lost track of the number of times that I have seen this splendidly made black & white film. Undoubtedly, the Warner Brothers film Casablanca ranks as one of the most famous and most written about commercial films that the studio produced during World War II. Aljean Harmetz dedicated an entire book to this classic romantic melodrama, ""Round Up the Usual Suspects: The Making of Casablanca."" Her work is the seminal account about the production of the film. Ironically, according to Harmetz, MGM producer Sam Marx wanted to buy the unproduced play ""Everybody Comes to Rick's"" by Murray Burnett and Joan Allison, which was the basis of the movie, but MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer ""didn't think it was worth the money.""Warner Brothers wound up buying the Burnett and Alison play for $20,000 on December 8, 1941. The studio assigned brothers Philip and Julius Epstein to write the script for this ""A"" budgeted picture, which they began on March 17, 1942. Howard Koch signed on later to rewrite their material.The American Film Institute noted that the studio hired Robert Aisner as technical adviser, because he had ""served on the Maginot Line and escaped from a concentration camp by way of Casablanca."" According to Harmetz, Koch--not the Epstein brothers--provided the protagonist, Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart of ""High Sierra""), with the controversial background of running guns to Ethiopia. ""Casablanca"" concerns a saloonkeeper in Casablanca and Ilsa, the wife of Czech resistance leader Victor Lazlo trying to escape to Lisbon. A flashback revealed that Rick and Ilsa had met in Paris and fallen in love. When Hitler's troops entered the city, Rick waited for Ilsa at the train depot, but she did not join him. Instead, Sam, Rick's piano-playing friend, brings a note from Ilsa to Rick. In the note, Ilsa says that she loves him but cannot go with him. Rick is devastated. He and Sam escape from the Nazis, and Rick opens ""Rick's Café Americain,"" a bar and restaurant in Casablanca. The establishment has illicit gambling tables in the back. He befriends the womanizing Prefect of Police, Captain Renault (Claude Rains of ""Now, Voyager""), and lets him win at his roulette wheel. Rick's refusal to leave Casablanca when he could easily arrange his own departure puzzles the inquisitive Renault. Rick minds his own business. A rival café owner, Ferrari, who dabbles in the black market, chides him about such a shortsighted attitude. ""My dear Rick,"" Ferrari observes, ""when will you realize that in this world, today, isolationism is no longer a practical policy?"" In another scene with Renault, Rick replies when Renault cautions him about warning a man Renault plans to arrest with Rick's by now signature line of dialogue, ""I stick my neck out for nobody."" Renault congratulates him for his stance and confides in him that he has never arrested him because Rick does mind his own business. Meanwhile, thousands of refugees from war-torn Europe stream into Casablanca searching for some way to reach neutral Lisbon. Before people can leave French-ruled Morocco, they must show an exit visa signed by a French authority. A smalltime thief named Ugarte (Peter Lorre of ""M"") has slain two German couriers and stolen two letters of transit signed by General de Gaulle. Actually, the letters of transit served as a plot device that the Epstein brothers contributed to the screenplay. No such letters of transit existed in real life. Anyway, Ugarte entrusted the exit visas to Rick for safekeeping. In search of the visas, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman of ""Spellbound"") and her husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid of ""Now, Voyager""), walk into Rick's bar. Ilsa recognizes Sam and persuades him to play an old tune ""As Time Goes By."" Reluctantly, Sam plays it, only to have an outraged Rick storm in and reprimand him for playing the song that he had ordered Sam never to play again. Ilsa intervenes, but Rick wants nothing to do with her, not after the way she deserted him in Paris. Rick is surprised when he learns from Ilsa that she had been married before they met, but she had believed at the time that her husband had died in a Nazi concentration camp. She explains that her spouse's surprise appearance prompted her to break her date with Rick. Ilsa tells Rick that Victor and she are desperate to reach Lisbon, but they lack exit visas. German Major Strasser threatens to arrest Victor. The resistance leader reminds him, ""You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France."" Ilsa suspects that Rick has the letters of transit. Desperately, she threatens him with a gun, but knowing she could not shoot him, he ignores the gun. Later, Rick forces Renault to come to the airport where Ilsa and Victor appear. Forcing Renault to cooperate, Rick gives the letters of transit to Victor and Ilsa. At the last minute, Strasser appears at the airport and tries to detain Ilsa and Victor. Rick shoots Strasser. ""Well, Rick,"" Renault observes, ""you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot."" He and Rick watch as the plane lifts off with Ilsa and Victor on board. The film ends as Renault and Rick walk off into the fog, and Rick says, ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" Director Michael Curtiz never lets the action slacken. He stages everything with this customary efficiency. His use of shadows is good. The only flaw in ""Casablanca"" is the treatment of Sam. Spike Lee could rattle some cages over Sam's treatment. Rick sells the club without a word with Sam.",Casablanca

It also is a movie that will never become outdated. I'm sure that I'll still watch this movie with just as much pleasure in 50 years from now.""Casablanca"" is a great mix of a love-story and a war movie. The danger, tension and feeling of WW II are notable throughout the entire movie. The love-story is beautifully portrayed in the midst of all the danger. The movie features several subplots and the movie has surprising many layers. The dialog is superb and the movie has some truly quotable lines. The movie and its story will surely constantly keep your attention. It's both tense and romantic and the ending is a real classic. It has got to be one of the best movie endings of all time! Absolutely wonderful!A wonderful addition to the atmosphere of the movie is the now classic song; 'As Time Goes By' by Herman Hupfeld. It fits beautifully in the movie and plays a quite important role in the story.Perhaps the reason why the story works so well is because of the fine cast. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are two splendid leading actors, with some great chemistry and are supported by strong supporting actors such as Claude Rains, Paul Henreid, Conrad Veidt and Peter Lorre.Really a both powerful and beautiful movie that will NEVER lose any of its strength, mark my words!

33,evanston_dad,It Took Me a While to come Around....,8,29 April 2005,"Ah, ""Casablanca."" Is there a line from the film that hasn't become a cliché? That's not a criticism of the movie. If anything it's the reverse. What greater compliment to a film screenplay can a film audience make than so completely absorbing every word of it into its common cultural consciousness? It took me a long time and multiple viewings before I warmed up to Michael Curtiz's 1943 film (by some accounts a 1942 release). I'm not particularly a fan of either Ingrid Bergman or Humphrey Bogart, and the film-making techniques didn't strike me as anything inventive or unique and they still don't. At best, ""Casablanca"" exists as an example of the classic Hollywood style of film-making working at its slickest and most polished.But then on about the fourth viewing, it struck me. The people who love this movie don't love it for the striking visuals or the daring narrative or any of the elements that make, say, ""Citizen Kane"" such continual fuel for film discussion. People still love ""Casablanca"" for coming out at exactly the right moment in our cultural history, and somehow it's retained that ""right place, right time"" allure. America had been involved in World War II for at least two years by the time of this film's wide release, and many women had seen their men leave to face uncertain futures. So no wonder a film with such an intense nostalgic glow about it would strike a universal chord. No wonder the forbidden romance between the Bergman and Bogart characters seemed so intensely poignant. And no wonder the patriotic, ""do whatever you must for the good of the cause"" propaganda (for let's call it what it is), seemed so stirring (and still does).Is ""Casablanca"" a great film? I won't attempt to answer that, though it's not one of my personal favorites. But any film that carries its legacy with it the way this one does can't be completely dismissed either.My grade: B+",Casablanca
34,AlsExGal,As time goes by Casablanca is timeless,10,23 September 2012,"Most films about WWII made during WWII are so rah-rah over the top that at midpoint you want to stand up and say ""OK, I get it already, the Nazis are eeeeeevil."" This one is different. There are bad guys - Conrad Veidt's Major Strasser who practically slithers on his belly and hisses like a snake he is so vile, guys that are so good that their teeth sparkle in the sunlight - Heinreid's Victor Lazlo, and a whole bunch of gray characters just trying to get by - the kind of guys who vote for who they think the winner is going to be in a Presidential election. Maybe these gray characters are truly out for themselves and see it as a game or a matter of survival - Claude Rains's Captain Renault, or maybe they were fighters for the good fight at one time and when karma dealt them a bad blow they became cynical - Bogart's Rick Blaine.You've got a great supporting cast - Greenstreet, Lorre, Sakall, and Dooley Wilson as Sam, a guy with a rare level head who looks out for Rick and seems to see Rick's cynicism as an illness he has to be nursed through while tickling those ivories - a rare humanizing role for an African American in 1942.Plus this thing defies all laws of synergy - it works on a grand scale as an entire work of art, but you can break out individual scenes and enjoy them divorced from the rest of the film, and there are great individual lines suitable for framing ""I stick my neck out for no man"" and "" I'm shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here"" says Captain Renault as he closes down Rick's and stuffs gambling winnings into his pocket - this last line has almost become a metaphor for American politics and politicians.Bottom line - Rick Blaine is Han Solo. Both characters were vital to the success of the films in which they starred. People always love a romance/adventure involving a talented cynical loner who ultimately joins or rejoins the good fight for the right reasons, a guy who is a bit too good to be true, and a woman who is torn between actually loving the first kind of man and feeling like she should really love the second kind of man. That is Casablanca and that is Star Wars, but Star Wars does not have Captain Renault and Casablanca does! Wow, I've always been afraid of reviewing Casablanca because I didn't know where to start, and it looks like I just did.",Casablanca
35,Uriah43,One of the Best Films Ever Made,10,15 September 2019,"With the Nazis having already occupied France and conquered much of Eastern Europe, a stream of refugees desperately attempt to get to America by embarking on a tortuous path which includes getting to the small city of Casablanca in French Morocco and from there to Lisbon. However, as difficult as it is for these refugees to actually get to Casablanca, their travel is further complicated by the fact that nobody is allowed to take the daily flight from there to Lisbon without the written permission of the corrupt Vichy French police commander by the name of ""Captain Louis Renault"" (Claude Rains). So quite often these refugees have to wait for quite a long time and this-in and of itself-creates even more of a financial and logistical hardship upon them. So in an effort to find a solution to their problem or temporarily forget about their troubles, many of them flock to the most popular nightclub there known as ""Rick's Café Americain"" which is owned by a tough and worldly American expatriate named ""Rick Blaine"" (Humphrey Bogart). Yet, even though he is quite successful in Casablanca, he finds it hard to find any great happiness due to a previous romance which devastated him a year and a half earlier. However, things take a sudden turn for the worse when a famous anti-German activist named ""Victor Laszlo"" (Paul Henreid) walks into his nightclub-and with him is the woman who broke his heart that bleak and rainy day in Paris. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this is not only my favorite movie of all time but is also considered to be one of the best films ever made with a number of movie stars possibly turning in the best performances of their careers. I especially liked the chemistry between Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman (as ""Ilsa Lund"") along with the performance of Dooley Wilson as Rick's loyal companion ""Sam"". Be that as it may, I believe that this is one of the very few films that each and every viewer ought to see at least once and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. A classic in every sense of the word.",Casablanca

It stars Humphrey Bogart as a no nonsense nightclub owner during the second world war who is haunted by past romance. Ingrid Bergman reenters his life and all the memories return. She is now married to a fighter-resistant man who wishes to shelter himself in Bogart's nightclub. He evaporates into alcohol reflecting upon the last time he saw her. A masterpiece that avoids the predictable and goes for the emotional struggle. Directed by Michael Curtiz who previously made The Adventures of Robin Hood. Bogart flawlessly portraying a man struggling with brokenness and a crossroad of right and wrong. Bergman is terrific as a woman emotionally entangled within the past and present. In supporting roles are Claude Rains as a police chief who delivers the cheerful and much quoted final line. Paul Henreid plays Bergman's underground husband who must rely on his wife's former lover's integrity to survive. Peter Lorre also appears briefly in one of his sinister roles that he plays so well. This time his luck runs out when Bogart exposes him. The question arises as to whether this film is as great as its reputation claims.

40,SimonJack,"A unique film that can't be repeated, perhaps the best film of all time",10,29 June 2021,"Among film critics, historians, and movie buffs, ""Casablanca"" is considered one of the best films ever made. Several aspects make it unique among films of all time. These include historical situations that won't ever be repeated and other aspects that aren't likely to occur again. Indeed, the very plot and screenplay, with multiple genres, sets it apart from the pack. It's a great wartime drama with intrigue and suspense in an historical setting. It's a deep love story and human drama of anger, corruption, fear, hurt, forgiveness, sacrifice and redemption. It's a picture of underground resistance and patriotism in the face of evil forces. And, throughout, it is sprinkled with light touches of humor in just the right places.Most film reviewers and fans comment on the plot and the performances of the actors. The cast is tremendous. Few films have such a large cast with so many roles that contribute to the meat of the story. And the matches of actors to roles is perfect, from Bogart, Bergman, Rains and Henreid in the leads, to Greenstreet, Sakall, Veidt, Lorre and Wilson heading up a huge supporting cast.The most unique aspect of this film is the makeup of that huge cast. Only four of the main roles - less than 10 percent of the speaking parts, were actors born in the U. S. (Bogart, Wilson, Page and Qualen). A few of the cast were from elsewhere in the Americas, Asia and Africa. But the vast majority were European-born. Several were from U. K. countries in the war -- England, Scotland, Ireland, Australia, Canada. Yet, most of them were Jewish or other refugees who had fled to the U. S. or U. K. when the Nazis came to power. Some already had film careers in other countries, and many would have long film careers in the years ahead.These included Conrad Veidt, Curt Bois, and Trudy Erline from Germany; Paul Henreid from Austria; Peter Lorre and S. Z. Sakall from Hungary; Madeleine Lebeau from France; Leonid Kinskey from Russia; and Leon Belasco from present-day Ukraine. There were many actors in uncredited roles - again most from countries torn by the war. Several were from France, England, Austria-Hungary, Italy, Greece and Syria. Others were from Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Belarus, Russia, Ukraine, India, Algeria, Argentina, Mexico and elsewhere.""Casablanca"" is also unique historically, just for its time, place, setting and activity. Before WW II, Casablanca was an exotic place for tourists . It was the largest seaport in North Africa on the Atlantic Coast. After France's surrender to Germany in June 1940, it became a key link in the flow of people fleeing the Nazis, especially Jewish refugees. The German Afrika Korps had moved into the Mediterranean in January 1941. It was to bolster the Italian forces in North Africa, while the French Vichy ruled in French Morocco. Casablanca was a major seaport and air link to the Americas. Those who could afford it traveled by air through Lisbon, Portugal.The time of this movie was December 1941. Nazi agents wee in the city. Allied spies were there. A French resistance underground flourished. So, while the plot and characters of the movie are fictional, this film portrays the real life of Casablanca at the time.The idea for the story that led to this movie came from an American high school teacher, Murray Burnett. He and his wife vacationed in Europe in 1938. They visited Jewish relatives in Vienna who were preparing to flee ahead of the Nazi takeover of their country. They dined one night on the Riviera where a mixed crowd of French, refugees and Nazi officers were entertained by a black piano player. Back in the States, Burnett and a friend, Joann Alison wrote a play in 1940, called ""Everybody Comes to Ricks."" It was never produced but Warner Brothers learned about it and in 1942 paid the astronomical fee of $20,000 for the movie rights.The movie was filmed at the Warner Brothers studios and locales in California and Arizona, from late May to early August. After the Allied invasion of North Africa in November, the movie was rushed into production. It premiered in New York in December and was released across the U. S. and U. K. in January 1943. So, when audiences saw the film, the U. S. Army had already captured Morocco from the Vichy French and freed Casablanca on Nov 13.One can't help but wonder why Hollywood was supposedly surprised at the success of ""Casablanca."" After all, the superb wartime drama, ""Mrs. Miniver"" had topped the box office in 1942, except for the animated ""Bambi."" ""Mrs. Miniver"" won six Oscars of twelve Academy Award nominations. The following year, ""Casablanca"" won three Oscars of eight nominations, including best picture, best director (Michael Curtiz) and best screenplay.Many other films about World War II would win Oscars in the years ahead. Perhaps the interest in wartime movies is more for the human stories and history, than for the violence and destruction. Surely, ""Casablanca"" and many other great wartime films attest to that. This is one of the first films that the Library of Congress in 1989 picked to preserve in the National Film Registry.Here' are some favorite lines from ""Casablanca.""Rick Blaine, ""I'm no good at being noble. But it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.""Signor Ferrari, ""It would take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca, and the Germans have outlawed miracles.""Rick, ""And remember, this gun is pointed right at your heart."" Captain Renault, ""That is my least vulnerable spot.""Captain Renault, ""Carl, see that Major Strasser gets a good table - one close to the ladies."" Carl, ""I have already given him the best, knowing that he is German and would taka it anyway.""",Casablanca

He must choose between his love for a woman and helping her and her Czech Resistance leader husband escape from the Vichy-controlled Moroccan city of Casablanca to continue his fight against the Nazis.

42,JamesHitchcock,It gets better as time goes by,10,26 September 2012,"To mark my 1100th review for IMDb I turn to another of my favourite films. And not just one of mine. Its regular appearance on lists of the greatest films of all time suggest that ""Casablanca"" is also one of the world's favourite films. It has given the English language more well-known quotations than virtually any other film- ""Here's looking at you, kid"", ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"", ""Round up the usual suspects"", ""We'll always have Paris"", ""Play it again, Sam"" (yes, I know that one's a misquote) and ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine"" (also often misquoted, generally as ""Of all the bars..""). Yet at the time it was made, it was just one of many wartime propaganda films made by Hollywood. It was based upon an obscure play which had never been performed professionally. (It still hasn't in America, although it was produced briefly in London's West End in 1991). It starred an actor best known at that date for gangster pictures, and an actress whose early Hollywood films, apart from ""Intermezzo"", had not been wildly successful. Few would have predicted, therefore, that ""Casablanca"" would not only win the ""Best Picture"" Oscar for 1943 but would also go on to enjoy such lasting popularity. I don't intend to set out the plot, which is already well-known, in detail, but rather to discuss what makes it such a favourite of mine. One feature is what might be called its moral complexity, something it shares with the film noir style of which Humphrey Bogart was such a noted exponent. I would not, however, classify ""Casablanca"" as noir, largely because it does not, except perhaps in the airport scene at the end, use the sort of expressionistic photography which characterised the genre. I do not mean that the film is morally ambiguous politically. Its politics are quite clear; the Nazis are evil and the Allied cause is just. (For this reason, I always wish Michael Curtiz had been allowed to use the ""Horst Wessel Lied"" in the song-duel with ""La Marseillaise"". The producers, however, refused, on the bizarre grounds that the Nazi anthem was protected by copyright, so Curtiz had to substitute ""Die Wacht am Rhein"", a 19th–century patriotic song with no Nazi connotations). The film's ambiguity arises at a personal rather than political level. The only character who is unambiguously heroic is the noble and idealistic Victor. Rick Blaine starts off as a disillusioned cynic, cynical both about personal relationships and about politics, and unwilling to ""stick his neck out"" for anyone. He has a murky past, operates a gambling operation of dubious legitimacy and, for unexplained reasons, is unable to return to America. Ilsa is somewhat sanitised compared to Lois, the equivalent character in the original play, and explanations are provided for some of her more questionable actions, but the fact remains that she is in love with a man other than her husband, and would be prepared to desert her husband for that man. Louis Renault, the Chief of Police, is quite openly corrupt, accepting bribes to issue the vital ""exit visas"" which will enable refugees to leave Casablanca; if the refugee in question is an attractive woman he is prepared to accept payment in the form of sexual favours rather than cash. By the end of the film, however, all three have achieved redemption. Renault, who has no love for the Vichy regime he serves or their German masters, resolves to serve his country's interests rather than his own. Ilsa recognises that her place is by her husband's side and her duty to support him in his struggle. Rick not only recovers his lost political idealism but also, like Ilsa, sacrifices his own personal happiness and puts duty before love. Rick is the only major character who is an American, and can be seen as symbolising America's own journey from neutrality to wholehearted participation in the anti-Fascist struggle. It is significant that the action takes place in early December 1941, in the last few days before Pearl Harbor. The complexity of these three characters demands acting of a high standard, and Bogart, Bergman and Claude Rains are all excellent. Bogart is particularly good; this is the finest of all his performances that I have seen, better even than ""The African Queen"" for which he won his only Oscar. (Not having seen Paul Lukas in""Watch on the Rhine"" I cannot say whether Bogart deserved to win in 1943). There are several other good performances; those that stand out most come from Sydney Greenstreet as Rick's business rival Ferrari and Conrad Veidt as the main Nazi Major Strasser.Paul Henreid as Victor is sometimes regarded as the acting ""weak link"", and he is certainly less than charismatic, but I felt this was necessary to emphasise the contrast between his character and Rick's. Rick may have a dubious past, but Bogart also makes him fascinating and charming enough to win and retain Ilsa's love, even though she is married to a man of great nobility whom she deeply admires. Henreid, by contrast, makes Victor the sort of man who can inspire admiration but who does not perhaps have enough warmth on a personal level to retain the wholehearted love of his wife. Another notable feature is the musical score, making reference to the French and German national anthems, and the songs, especially ""As Time Goes By"", originally written in 1931 but since 1943 always associated with this film. There is not sufficient space here to do justice to all the many aspects of this wonderful film. I will therefore just close my review by saying that as a combination of war, adventure and romance, and for its perfect marriage of script, direction, acting and music, ""Casablanca"" cannot be beaten.

Reviews will not be read aloud in class unless otherwise stated below, at the end of the review.I've stated in previous reviews how difficult it is to review a film regarded as ""one of the best ever made"" or a classic because it would appear from constant analysis, its permanent mark in the minds of millions, and its loyal following that everything that could be said about the specific film has been said again and again. My thoughts on Casablanca aren't atypical or contrary to the public's consensus on the film. It's a bold picture with a lot layers and an engaging romance story all around.The film concerns American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), who owns and operates a nightclub in Casablanca which has now been considered a haven for French refugees (""no one really lives in Casablanca,"" so the saying goes). People gather at this nightclub in hopes of purchasing ""letters of transit,"" which will allow refugees to leave the area and flock to America. One day, out of the blue, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) and his wife Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) show up to Rick's nightclub, much to Rick's surprise, as Ilsa is one of the only women he has ever fallen in love with. Ilsa, from the start, is a beautiful, almost angelic woman with incomparable charisma and beauty. Upon her return, Rick must question if he still has feelings for Ilsa, as does Ilsa, all while remembering that Victor does have the ability to get her to safety in America.Like many films of its time, Casablanca was made, released, well-received but, at the time, thought of as just another drama made in the wake of another world war. It wasn't until the war ended that the popularity and the great reception of Casablanca began to flourish and expand before the film earned its place as one of the top American films ever made one of the reasons for this, I believe, is how many angles from which one can view this film. It can be seen as a morality tale, a romance (both which I find to be the strongest ways to see the film), an allegorical picture with Rick representing America's neutrality during the time of the war and Ilsa representing France as a country tempting to sway the U.S. in one particular direction, or as a period piece with only a handful of characters.Moreover, I'm instantaneously reminded of one scene in particular whenever I think of Casablanca and its true emotional power that scene comes later in the film when the French national anthem is sung in a room full of refugees, many of them French, who authentically show emotion due to the entire scene being an act of improvisation. The shot of a young woman bawling in part nationalistic pride, part shock hits right in the soul.Something must also be said about the black and white photography in the film, which is purely utilized to generate an effect and an emotion on the viewer. Consider the scene where Ilsa attempts to get through to a clearly weary and slightly drunk Rick. Director Michael Curtiz fixates the camera so that both characters can be seen, but the left corner of the screen, where Rick lies, is darker and bleaker than where Ilsa is, which is the top right part of the frame. In Ilsa's corner, it's brighter and the lighting alludes to a more optimistic feeling. This is a brilliant example of doing the difficult task of capturing two moods in one single shot.Intricacies like that, the beautiful chemistry between Bogart and Bergman, the harsh morality at the center of it all, the controversial ending, and the immensity of emotions is why Casablanca is regarded as such a classic picture.Starring: Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul Henreid. Directed by: Michael Curtiz.",Casablanca
44,Smells_Like_Cheese,"One of the best movies of all time, as for the classics, this is #1!",10,28 February 2005,"I watched ""Casablanca"" as a child, and was very bored with it. But I was a kid, and black and white movies were not very appealing to me. I always thought this movie was over rated and nothing but a sob fest. But finally I sat my butt down to give it another shot. I was so glad I did. I see this movie not only as a classic, but what the movies of today are missing. ""Casablanca"" is so incredibly effective. Not just the acting, but the whole setting. Being released during WWII, you have a better idea of what the time was like. Movies were a way of escaping the world and this was a way to escape but pull you back into reality. I really enjoyed ""Casablanca"" and would watch it again any time.10/10",Casablanca
45,MovieAddict2016,Not my favorite but definitely the most memorable film of all time...,9,17 August 2003,"Some of this review was edited due to this site's word limit.Regarding ""Casablanca,"" Roger Ebert wrote in his Great Movies essay, ""If we can identify strongly with characters in some movies, then it is no mystery that 'Casablanca' is one of the most popular films of all time."" Add ""and one of the most memorable"" to that statement. Almost any list you happen to come across of great movies will contain ""Casablanca,"" as it has almost nestled itself firmly into our world's foundation. It is what one would call a memorable film. It may not be memorable for the audiences of today who find it boring, long, weary and tiresome, but it will always be remembered. That isn't something you can say for most movies. In one hundred years, do you think ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy will really - really - be remembered?""Casablanca"" is a love story, just as so many other films released to this day, but upon a viewing two nights ago, I asked myself what sets it apart from the rest. Just what has made it what it is today? Is it the direction by Michael Cortiz, the chemistry between the actors, or the actors themselves? Is it the sly side of dark comedy, or just the nostalgia of the film that drives so many viewers? Or perhaps it is the cliffhanger finale (those filming the movie didn't even know what would happen at the end of the film due to constantly changing scripts and the 1940s Production Code permitting a married woman from leaving her husband for another man). Even if it isn't, the ending is superb, depressing and uplifting, one of the strangest, saddest, and happiest endings I have ever seen, in which Bogart mutters the famous last lines, ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""Bogart plays Rick Blaine, a chain smoker and heavy drinker living in Casablanca, French Morocco, during WWII. During WWII, European immigrants fled from their homeland down to Africa, in hopes of sailing off the coast to Portugal, and then to America, land of freedom. Because of this, Casablanca is inhabited by petty thieves, vicious murderers, and ruthless citizens. Every day a plane leaves from the local airport, carrying the precious few with Visa Passes to freedom. Those applying for a Visa Pass on the black market might come in contact with the crook Ugarte (Peter Torre).One night the thief Ugarte visits Rick's bar in Casablanca and asks him to hide two Visa Passes he has acquired by unrespectable means. Rick reluctantly agrees, only to watch Ugarte be taken away by French officials the same night, in his very bar. ""Rick, you have to help me!"" he screams as he is dragged away. Rick takes a puff on his cigarette and remains solid. A bystander says, ""Gee, Rick, I hope when they come to take me away you help me out a little bit more than that!"" Rick remains a statue and says, ""I stick my neck out for nobody.""We can sense Rick was a good guy at one time, but as Marilyn Monroe once said, he probably ""got the fuzzy end of the lollipop."" He is tired of fighting for the good cause. So he maintains his bar and tries not to care about anyone. His piano player Sam (Dooley Wilson) knows the real Sam, and tries to evoke it, but Sam just sits in silence and drinks and smokes and lets himself stay drenched in misty smoke.That all remains until Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) walks through his doors. It turns out that Ilsa left Sam and Rick waiting at a train station in the rain some time ago in Paris, France, during the German occupation. Rick never saw her since. That night she walks into his bar, he sits at a table in his joint, and in a mopy tone says, ""Of all the gin joints in all the world, she walks into mine."" This is a very effective line.Do delve into the plot any further is pointless. Not only will it spoil interesting tidbits, but it is just plain pointless to explain anymore. But I will say that every frame is handled with care and the extreme close-ups in this film are amazingly effective. Sergio Leone was known for his extreme close-ups, but those in ""Casablanca"" seem to capture an innocence of the characters that I have rarely seen equaled in other films.Bogart is at the top of his game in this film, only equaled in ""The Maltese Falcon."" Ingrid Bergman is superb, as well, but the supporting cast is equally impressive. Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Claude Rains, Peter Henreid and Dooley Wilson all steal the show - well, maybe not Henreid, but that's because he's not really supposed to. This is the perfect example of a well-rounded cast. Too often nowadays attention is paid to the lead actors and not the supporters - this has both great leads and great supporters.People often ask me what my favorite film is. And to be frankly honest, it certainly isn't ""Casablanca."" To me, lists of favorites in ranking order are pointless and silly - who am I to declare my favorite film, when I have not even seen some of the greatest unknown films out there? If someone asks me to tell them my favorite film I have seen, I usually say I don't have one. I still think lists of favorite-ever films are silly. I have various favorites in various genres, but not an ""all-time-favorite."" Despite this, ""Casablanca"" is one of those films that has permeated our culture. It will never go away. I'm not sure if it's one of my top ten favorites, but if there is a difference between a favorite film and a most memorable film, ""Casablanca"" sure does disguise it.",Casablanca
46,DKosty123,Classic,10,27 August 2006,"There is no term to describe this other than classic, but not the type of classic that a film like THE WIZARD OF OZ or GONE WITH THE WIND are. That is because when this film was being made, it was just another assembly line production from it's studio (Warner). When you see it today, the cast appears so great that you would think it was something special, but this supporting cast, great as it is, worked together often. What this has in common with the WIZARD is a great script.The writers of CASABLANCA came up with a script that tops all other films in classic moments of quotes that have become a part of Americana. So many quotes from this film are used in other films & media that they have become cliché almost. Even miss-quotes like ""Play It Again, Sam"" from this film have become American folk-lore. ""Round up the Usual Suspects"" has become it's own film later. ""You & Me, Kid""- the list goes on & on.Other than the Great Oz, these quotes just flow from this film to 100's of other works since this film was made.What makes this film really special is the unfulfilled love between Bogart & Bergman's character that is left hanging at the end. In an era, where love always had to have a happy ending, this movie gloriously leaves us with people in love who are forced away from each other by circumstances beyond either of their control. This theme is closer to real life than most Hollywood products of any era. Almost everybody can identify with it because haven't we all had a love in our life who we yearned for very much, but due to circumstances beyond us, we never had a chance to fulfill? That is too me what makes this film stand above all others.This is a film that has action, but not much of it. This film has comedy, but only enough to make the film great. It has subtle patriotic themes that carry the film along. Most importantly, this film has the heart of every viewer who ever watches it because the film, by accident, touches themes that many films aspire to reach, but never achieve. Ironically, this all happened by the greatest of chance & rarely has any movie ever come close to what this film is. If I were a filmmaker, actor, or had a career in this industry, this would be the film I wish I had worked on. Nothing gets better than this one.",Casablanca
47,Red-Barracuda,"A good film, although I struggle to understand why it's regarded quite so highly",6,10 September 2014,"This wartime romance is one that seems to consistently be referred to as a classic and one of the best Hollywood films ever. Whenever I watch it though, I can never really work out why. It's a good film, no doubt, but I can never truly get to grips with why it is so beloved. Whereas, the previous year's Citizen Kane is one whose excellence is very obvious, Casablanca seems more like a very well made yet conventional bit of cinema. Not that this is a bad thing of course.It does have a pretty impressive cast though, that is one thing for sure. Humphrey Bogart as the cynical Rick and Ingrid Bergman as the woman, Ilsa, who changes him make for a memorable screen couple; while the support cast is even better, with Claude Rains, Peter Lorre and Conrad Veidt all at the top of their games in this one. The North African setting provides a nice exotic feel, while the World War II backdrop ensures that there is a definite menace underpinning everything. But this film is probably most famous for its romance, with a final few scenes that have become incredibly famous, with lines of dialogue that have been repeated and misquoted ever since.A good film but I still don't really get the unadulterated love.",Casablanca
48,disdressed12,maybe a bit dated but well worth the watch,7,21 February 2010,"i enjoyed Casablanca,but i wouldn't say it changed my life.it's a pleasant movie,with a good story,good acting,a good locale and an interesting cast of characters.there are some memorable lines,to be sure,but some of them some seem a bit corny.there were one or two eye rolling sentimental lines delivered by Humprey Bogart to Ingred Bergman.but i realize that's probably due to the fact that the movie was made almost 60 years ago.regardless,it's well worth watching,in my opinion.there's no special effects.so it's really all about the characters,the story,and the acting.if those elements aren't successful,then the movie won't work.in this case,they are.for me,Casablanca is a 7/10",Casablanca
49,sddavis63,A Classic War Movie That Doesn't Seem Like A War Movie,8,28 February 2008,"Having somehow never seen this classic movie, I was glad to have finally had the chance to watch it, and understand why it's seen as a classic. What I liked most about it was what it wasn't. Unlike most war movies that I've seen that were actually made during World War II, this has no battle scenes and no overtly patriotic binges (and what patriotism there is is French rather than American, which I found refreshing.) It comes across not as propaganda, but as a very human and very well done story about the struggles of living in Casablanca (governed by Vichy France) during the Second World War.Humphrey Bogart seemed to me to be perfectly cast as Rick Blaine - the owner of an American cafe in Casablanca who for the most part tries to stay out of politics, although his contempt for the Germans clearly comes across in a variety of scenes. Ingrid Bergman also did a great job as Ilsa, a former love interest of Rick's who desperately needs Rick's help to escape to America with her husband (played by Paul Henreid) who is a leader of the anti-Nazi underground and has escaped from a Nazi concentration camp. Bogart and Bergman were great together; to be honest I thought Bergman and Henreid were less so, although what I sensed as the awkwardness between them may well have been a deliberate way of portraying Ilsa's confusion about her feelings for Rick. Claude Rains I thought did a great job playing Police Prefect Renault. He seemed to capture the dilemma of most officials of Vichy France - as he said himself, he blows ""with the wind, and for the moment the wind is blowing from Vichy."" His relationship with the Germans is deferential, and yet one gets the impression that basically, trapped in a tough situation, he's looking out for himself, which is probably what many Vichy officials did.With a strong cast and a strong story featuring believable characters you end up with a very strong movie. It's interesting rather than exciting, and much better than most of the standard anti-Nazi patriotic binges that I've seen from the war years. (Having seen ""Casablanca"" I may now be inclined to watch some of Bogart's other war era movies.) 8/10",Casablanca
50,llltdesq,Everybody comes to Rick's.,9,18 August 2015,"This is one of the greatest films of all time. There will be spoilers ahead: I doubt that there's anything I can add about this film which hasn't been said before (and likely said better than I'll say it) but I'm going to throw mt two cents in the pot in any case.There are many ways to comment on a film. One can discuss the storyline, summarize the plot, talk about the filming techniques/technical aspects or just say what you love about the film. It becomes both harder and easier when you're discussing one of the most widely seen films of all time.You can watch the film and notice the clichés, but then you should remind yourself that most of those clichés are clichés because of this film. I choose to discuss some of the supporting cast in this review, because Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Sidney Greenstreet and Claude Rains have undoubtedly been justifiably praised to the skies enough already.This film is peppered with supporting characters, some of whom have notably sized roles, like Peter Lorre as Ugarte, S.Z. Sakall as Carl, Leonid Kinsky as Sascha (the last two providing much of what comic relief there is in the film) John Qualen as Berger, Marcel Dalio as Emil and Conrad Veidt as Major Strasser, the serious heavy of the film.Then there are bit characters-there's a pickpocket early in the film, there's Rick's girlfriend Yvonne (almost the only other female role of consequence in the film) and two married couples, an older couple who have a nice scene with Carl which is hilarious and a young couple, who are Bulgarians basically trapped in Casablanca without an exit visa. Their vignette permits the audience to see Rick's softer side and offers a nice bit of character development.All of the characters here have their moments and the only performance which just misses the mark is Sakall's as Carl. For me, the scenery-chewing Sakall does here is just a bit too much to completely work for me. Even then, he still does a serviceable job.Last, but by no means least, there's Sam, played by Dooley Wilson. Sam more properly belongs in the significant players with Bogart, Bergman and the rest, as he's probably been highly and frequently praised, as he should be. But I just had to say a few words about Wilson's performance as Sam. It's extraordinary. Most of Wilson's scenes are with Bogart and the two work together marvelously. The musical numbers Wilson performs are highlights of the film, particularly ""Knock On Wood"" and ""As Time Goes By"". Wilson's supporting performance makes the film stronger.This film is available on DVD/Blu-Ray and is well worth watching. Most recommended.",Casablanca
51,cherold,"Amazing directing, script, acting",10,19 November 2013,"It's been a few years since I last watched Casablanca, but it is as good as I remember. Curtiz's direction is remarkable. The beginning scenes set the movie up beautifully, and everything moves at an almost breathless pace. It is a movie that moves fast yet never exhausts, always able to slow down for a moment and let the audience breath. The script is one of the most quotable in Hollywood history, full of memorable lines and sharp, witty dialog. The plot is engaging, constantly moving and turning.The acting is uniformly excellent. Bogart is the center of the movie, offering that classic jaded white knight Bogie. Bergman gives one of her best performances as well. Even small roles are beautifully done; Peter Lorre makes every second of his time on screen count. As for Claude Raines, he is so utterly perfect that he would have stolen the movie entirely if he hadn't been up against Bogie.All that being said, I love some parts of Casablanca more than others. The early scenes are incredible, the finale is genius, but the Paris scenes, while necessary, feel a little slack, and Paul Henreid is a little bland for a charismatic resistance fighter. But those are minor quibbles. This is still one of the greatest movies of a great decade for movies.",Casablanca
52,Robert_duder,600 Reviews and now I am tackling what many consider the greatest film ever made,8,2 January 2008,"I have never seen Casablanca until today. I had planned for some time that this would be my 600th review and I think it's very fitting. Is Casablanca truly the magnificent piece of cinematic history or does it simply have something that many classics are fortunate to have...cine-magic as I will call it. Some films just have this style, this charisma, the perfect balance of the something special that makes them endearing to millions and I think Casablanca is the perfect example of this. Furthermore Casablanca is often known as one of the 'greatest romance films of all time' but despite the romantic undertone the film is more of a World War II drama about patriotism and escaping the Nazi grip on the area. For its time, and the film certainly is timeless, but the gritty, dark setting sets a tone for danger and intrigue and mystery and even that romance. The characters are so sleek and have so much depth and you are just immediately enthralled with this story and this beautiful Casablanca world. The true brilliance of watching Casablanca now is feeling the classic aura. This film has SO many lines that are now truly pop culture history and so many moments that you will immediately recognize even if you've never seen it before.This is my first Humphrey Bogart film and 'Bogie' is one incredible guy. He brings a whole new meaning to macho. Rick Blaine (Mr. Rick) is definitely a cinematic character you won't ever forget. He's rough and rugged and smart and has a deep history that unravels through the film and Bogart is terrific. He embodies the character and brings it right to the forefront of the film. From his drunken stupor as he cries for his lost love, to the final moments of saving lives he is amazing. Ingrid Bergman is beautiful yet her character is very subtle. She plays the mysterious and illusive Ilsa Lund. I can't say her performance is on par with Bogart's because her character is much more withdrawn and less bold but her magic performance comes from the fact that her and Bogart have incredible, unmistakable chemistry the likes of which you never see on screen anymore. For this reason no one else could replace her. Paul Henreid is also very good as the tough but decent Victor Laszlo. Henreid holds his own opposite Bogart, which is an impressive feat, and still creates a very impulsive and interesting character. Claude Rains also deserves mention as the menacing and self involved Nazi, Captain Renault.Casablanca is the perfect example of the all the right ingredients lining up to create something completely magical. It would be hard to not have a brilliantly directed film like Casablanca with a director like Michael Curtiz who has no less than an astounding 170 plus films to his credit. Casablanca might be one of his most famous credits but for good reason. Casablanca isn't a perfect film...hence my lack of a 10/10 on it...or even a 9/10. I think some movie goers especially nowadays might find Casablanca slow paced, maybe even with some less than stellar dialog and it does reek of it's anti Nazi moral (not that there is a problem with that) but it definitely has that tone. The terrific romance that is always talked about is slowly unraveled and never really hits a climax but is more about romance in the past and love lost. Its actually more of a tragic romance and in that respect might turn romance fans off. Still the romance that once blossomed between Bogart and Bergman is still fiery and the story is sweet AND tragic. Regardless of how you look at it Casablanca stands the test of time and is something everyone must see at least once and I am glad to have seen it and will most definitely see it again. If nothing else you must watch the final scene on the air strip which is packed full of more classic lines and moments than any other part. Simply brilliant. 8.5/10",Casablanca
53,Lejink,Play it again and again,9,2 January 2020,"Like all great art, ""Casablanca"" is a film that stands repeat viewings time after time, until you get to the point where you're saying whole lines of dialogue in lip-synch with the actors. I've just watched it again for the umpteenth time and still get caught up in the foreign intrigue, instinctive direction and superb playing of all the leads.The film's screenplay has won awards as the best ever, which is of course ironic considering it was going through rewrites right up until shooting and the actors themselves didn't always understand the convoluted plotting. Perhaps their uncertainty helps give the film its edge, no-one quite knows how it's all going to finish until the pieces fall perfectly into place in the closing ten minutes at the airfield.With more classic lines than any other film I can think of, including the most misquoted one ever, every plot and sub-plot is deftly handled and resolved. Moreover, it was undoubtedly brave of Warner's to take a patriotic stand at a time when the war was going badly for the Allies and one can only imagine the boost to morale the famous scene, when the patrons of Rick's Place drown out the provocative would-be triumphal and mocking singing of the German soldiers with their heartfelt rendition of the Marseillaise, gave to watching filmgoers in free Europe, especially France.At its heart of course is a love story, a beautiful, twisted, dangerous and ultimately doomed love story, but it never upsets the balance of the film which helps it to ultimately satisfy on so many levels.The acting, of course, is beyond reproach, Bogart as the cynical bar-owner with a conscience, Bergman, luminously beautiful but subtle and sensitive as she guards her heart, Rains, brilliant as the weather-vane local cop playing every angle and Heinreid as the noble, brave partisan who's also enough of a man of the world to forgive his wife's accidental transgression. Plus of course, even in the minor roles, some little more than cameos by Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Dooley Wilson and others, there are eye-catching and memorable performances.And let's not forget the astute direction of Michael Curtiz, often regarded and indeed derided by some critics as a journeyman, contractual director, known as a reliable and efficient studio-man who got the job done in an unflashy way. Be that as it may, I know he's directed many Hollywood features which are favourites of mine and if ever a movie needed an unflashy treatment, it was this one.Curtiz knew that when it comes to great story-telling in celluloid, the fundamental things apply and that's why ""Casablanca"" will be loved and revered, as time goes by.",Casablanca
54,ElMaruecan82,"We'll always have ""Casablanca"" ...",10,14 July 2011,"A few movies managed to achieve such a legendary status. Think about it, all you have to do is to hum the first notes of 'As Time Goes By'  ta-da ta-da ta-daaa  and a whole universe resurrects in your memories, forever incarnated by these two profiles staring at each other, Humphrey Bogart in the iconic trench-coat of his career-defining role, and Ingrid Bergman, as gracious as ever.One word : ""Casablanca"", and a gallery of characters revives, Sam, the piano player, these unforgettable second-billed actors who graced the silver screen in these black and white days, Conrad Veidt, Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, an international cast and so many immortal scenes, Rick Blaine's bourbon-driven melancholy while remembering the good old days with Ilsa, the patriotic fervor expressed during the singing of La Marseillaise and probably the most emotional farewell scene ever, followed by ""the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" as the ending of a beautiful movie. Of course, the list would be incomplete without the mention of Michael Curtiz' masterful direction, the dazzling shadowy cinematography and the Esptein twins' perfect script that lurched the film into Pop-Culture : ""Here's looking at you, kid"", ""We'll always have Paris"" and so many unforgettable lines that became catchphrases on their own. But still, everything would all have been secondary if it wasn't for THE element that made ""Casablanca"" such a legendary film : it's a beautiful romance.60 years later, the movie still divides, should have Ilsa gone with Rick or Laszlo? The consensus is that she did the right choice, but there's no doubt that the truer love was Rick. The film perfectly captured the dilemma of a real triangular love as Ilsa's husband, Viktor Lazslo is fundamentally a good man, a heroic resistant fighter who escaped from a concentration camp, and the only man who inspired Rick Blaine a bit of admiration. As an ex-freedom fighter, Rick sure understands the value of courage and visibly, something from the past has metamorphosed his idealistic nature into the cynical and detached mask of a lone wolf figure. Who else than Humphrey Bogart could have played this role with such intensity? Intense but still profoundly romantic as the wound in Rick's heart opens when Lazslo comes back with Ilsa, Rick's former love, back then in Paris.The international atmosphere of the Rick's Café nightclub gives it a unique and absolutely endearing flavor spiced up that pivotal night, when Ilsa asks Sam to play 'As Time Goes By', we understand that this song has a poignant significance, as the last one she and Rick heard as lovers, before the War came and ruined everything. Ilsa ran out of Rick who, like most of the refugees, escaped from the German invasion leaving Paris to Marseilles, then Marseilles to Oran, and from Oran to Casablanca, in French Morocco, freed from the German control, to get visas to the neutral Portugal, the only way to America. Rick exiled himself in Casablanca, as if something was unconsciously keeping him within the War, and when he delivers the legendary : ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine"" is he really lamenting? When Ilsa re-enters his life, his office, Rick's bitterness made him say the wrong words, but then he painfully realizes he still loves her, and that Lazlso took her from him.Lazslo and Ilsa need two 'letters of transit' to go to Lisbon, and by an ironic coincidence, Rick got those two tickets from a suave criminal named Ugarte who got them by murdering two German couriers. With the death of Ugarte, the two tickets for freedom were in Rick's hand and a great moral dilemma in his heart : contributing to the War effort and lose the love or his life, or following his motto : ""I stick my neck out for nobody"". Rick's true nature can't fool anyone, but the romance gains in complexity when Ilsa revealing to Rick why she left him, reconciles with him and realizes she loves him more than ever and can't leave him again. The romance is in a dead-end, and compromised by the antagonistic presence of the Major Heinrich Strasser who can't allow Lazzlo to escape. Strasser counts on the collaboration of Vichy's government, incarnated by Captain Renault, another character we still don't know where his heart belongs to, as he said : ""This is my least vulnerable spot"" Ultimately, and I guess this is what makes the movie so inspiring, as said Roger Ebert in his brilliant commentary, all the characters aren't bad people. Even the ambiguity of Captain Renault is a nice writing touch that allows to keep uncertain the role he's going to play, although the roulette episode proved his good heart. Even Greenstreet as the head of the criminal underworld and Rick's business rival accepts to buy him out and keep all the employees, even Yvonne, the French girl who dated a Nazi officer couldn't hide her tears when the Marseillaise was sung. Finally, the heroic nature of Rick Blaine prevailed as he decided to take care of everything, fooling Ilsa, Lazzslo, and Renault, but ultimately getting them in the plane. Renault also redeemed himself by the ""Round up the usual suspects"" to clear Rick of shooting Major Strasser before he could order to cancel the flight.Rick, #4 hero in the American Film Institute, explains his decision to Ilsa : ""I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world"". He's twice wrong. First, Rick is excellent at being noble. Secondly, now that WW2 is over but not ""Casablanca""'s legendary status, whether you love old, classic, black and white films or not, you should ask yourself if the problems of three little problems aren't finally the essence of the most beautiful acts that humanity could inspire.",Casablanca
55,paul2001sw-1,Surprisingly modern,7,18 September 2010,"Watching 'Casablanca' for the first time one is struck by a number of things: the already-known dialogue (though of course, not including the exact line, ""Play it again, Sam"", which no-one actually says); the swanky nature of Rick's bar, the very un-African nature of Casablanca in general and the fact that Sam, although a minor character, is a black man presented as intelligent and even a friend of the Humphrey Bogart's hero, in a way that can't have been completely normal in 1942. I also like the way that Sam's music is integrated into the film, although in places the soundtrack overdoes the romantic notes. It's also interesting to think about the story-lines chosen by film-makers before the war was won, although the film isn't quite as detached from the allied cause as it first suggests. Overall, it's aged much better than most films of its era, probably because it's mainly a character study, albeit one supported by a heavy dose of wisecracking; and it's stateless characters, drifting through a world that has lost it's certainties, live beyond the bounds of conventional morality in a very matter-of-fact way. Of course it won Oscars, but a comparison with the modern day is telling; in how many contemporary blockbusters does the hero let his girl go?",Casablanca

'Casablanca (1942)' is a cynical but well-drawn piece with a gruff lead who's callously charismatic and charming in that straight-talking kind of way. It manages to make you care for quite a small story while highlighting that, no matter how insignificant it may actually be in the grand scheme of things, it means the world to the characters caught in the middle of it. 7/10",Casablanca
57,gbill-74877,"Romantic, gritty, stoic, larger than life, and epic",10,29 November 2017,"There's not really much one can add all of the comments about this film, a masterpiece that is truly deserving of being in the list of top movies of all time. The story is perfectly crafted, intersecting a love triangle with the crushing pressures of wartime, and It's perfectly told by Director Michael Curtiz, with a flashback, a few surprises, and not a single wasted shot. Most importantly, the film captures the feeling of those huge moments in life that we'll always remember, where everything in one's life pivots, as well as the pain of love lost. Bogart holding that note in the rain, the ink beginning to run down as he's urged to get on the train, is later mirrored by him watching the plane disappear into the fog, the signal light reducing to a pinprick, and both moments are incredibly poignant.The cast is also outstanding – Bogart and Bergman of course, but also almost all of the supporting characters. Claude Rains as the Vichy French captain whose loyalties sway in the wind is my personal favorite. In a sweeping story that could have easily been cloying or corny, there is great realism in characters who are morally ambivalent (Rains, Lorre, and Bogart himself) put next to those who are willing to sacrifice themselves for a good cause, and those bent on taking over the world. There are many wonderful scenes, and not just those between Bogart and Bergman. Paul Henreid is great with Bergman too, and the scene where he leads the French ex-pats in singing 'La Marseillaise' to drown out the German officers singing their own patriotic is rousing. And let's not forget Dooley Wilson, who is so smooth, singing among other things the iconic ""As Time Goes By"". This film is romantic, gritty, stoic, larger than life, and epic - and one that I never get tired of seeing.",Casablanca

Oh, and America goes to war at last.",10,17 October 2009,"Casablanca (1942)When Rick (the inimitable Bogart) says to Sam (the inimitable Dooley Wilson), ""If it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?"" he's announcing to everyone that this is a movie about Pearl Harbor. That is, it is about this hardboiled, pre-noir American type, who sticks his neck out for no one, and his growing need to go to war.Need and desire. That's part of the compelling mood of the movie--everything feels like it has to be so. Americans are (by implication) really good at heart, and of course we'll come to the air of pretty Norwegians trapped by love and reluctant Frenchmen trapped by circumstance and all those very interesting lovable refugees (some real refugee actors), trapped by Nazi meanness and brutality, plain and simple.The romance? That, in a way, is the MacGuffin, not the other way around. Certainly, the famous end to the movie leaves the romance in the dust. Casablanca is a call to arms, for all the best reasons, and it appeals across the decades, too. In fact, the movie premiered on Thanksgiving, 1942, so the U.S. is fully in the war by the time people see it. And it resonates as a confirmation, and almost as prescient. We trust Bogart, by now, to be the right kind of man in every circumstance, just like our own men, husbands, fathers, brothers on the field.These great things don't make the movie great. Not as a movie. The writing, above all, does that (the Epsteins labored and were as inspired as they were gifted in this, with Howard Koch). But the filming is gorgeous, every scene filled with dense layers foreground to back, including layers of light, and often moving light, from searchlights and passing cars, or in the café as the lights move from piano to band and so on. Actors move across the screen in fluid conversation, sometimes for a laugh, often for a drink, eventually to see Rick, or to fret about getting out, getting to Lisbon, getting to America. It's all idealized and frightening at the same time. The bit actors are astonishing, the direction by the seasoned but unexceptional Curtiz is compact and elegant. Bogart is perfect. There isn't much to say new, or old, that's worth the time here, with everything out there so well said already. Just Google the movie and read away. Or better yet, watch it again. If you think you've seen the movie enough, look beyond plot and really listen to the writing, and watch the camera-work and lights.

An ex-pat American, he now runs a cafe, named after him, in Casablanca, Morocco. Its 1942 and many folks who want to escape Hitler arrive in Morocco to look for a visa to go to the United States. Not very many are successful. So, Rick sees desperate people every day at his establishment. Most of the time he is unmoved, as for some reason, Rick is a jaded fellow. However, he does come across a pair of valuable visas when someone trusts him to hid them in his piano player Sam's instrument. Not long after, ""THE WOMAN"", Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) comes into the place, asking Sam to play a song Rick has forbidden him to play. When he comes rushing to chastise him, he meets Ilsa. Flashing back, we learn that Ilsa had a grand love with Rick in Paris, just as the Nazis were getting closer and closer. Yet, when they made plans to escape on a train, Rick was jilted on the platform. No Ilsa arrived. Now, will Rick learn why this happened? Yes! Ilsa had a huge secret which comes spilling out, only to make Rick hurt all over again. In the meanwhile, the Germans in town are trying to find an escaped hero of their concentration camps, Victor (Paul Henreid). He is the most wanted man in Africa and word has it he's coming to Casablanca. Can Rick be an uncaring spectator forever? This beautiful, classic film has everything, as you have probably heard. It's a fine romance, with grand passion indeed. The story is a heart grabber and the cast is superlative. Made before anyone knew how long Hitler would remain in power, and at a time when he was winning the war, one sees how all of Europe wanted to escape his clutches.

Rommel's Afrika Korps were just defeated in Egypt. On the other side of Africa, Casablanca, Morroco is the crossroads of politics--""""unoccupied France""--where everyone has an angle or a desperate dream. Local police share their powers with Vichy and Nazi forces. And at the center of Casablanca is a bar where everyone goes. It is owned by Richard Blaine (Humphrey Bogart)--an American who is above the fray, indifferent to politics. Business is his religion and his mistress.The death of two German couriers triggers a shakedown of the ""usual suspects"" and a general alert goes out for the murderer and for a dissident who has escaped from Europe.On this night a foreign couple arrives, upsetting the delicate equilibrium of Casablanca and Rick's world. Rick insists ""I stick my neck out for nobody"", but the police captain Renault (Claude Rains) suspects that Rick is ""At heart a sentimentalist"".The story of ""Casablanca"" is multi-layered. While it is a product of its time and place, it is also universal and timeless. Every time I watch this film, I discover more details and I appreciate even more how well it is constructed.Filmed during WWII, ""Casablanca"" is an acknowledged classic and winner of the Oscar for Best Film. There are many reasons for its reputation, including a stellar cast, excellent writing, its music, and a stylish presentation that might be called international noir.

66,ironhorse_iv,"Of all the review joints, in all the towns, in all the world, you walks into mine. Here's to you, Kid. Casablanca is iconic! Play it again, Sam.",9,3 August 2013,"From 1942, comes a romantic historic drama directed by Michael Curtiz movie based on the stage play Everybody Comes to Rick's by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. It's early Dec. 1941, American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is the owner of an upscale nightclub in Casablanca, Morocco that attracts everybody from Vichy French, Italian, and German officials; to refugees desperate to reach the still neutral United States; and those who prey on them. Rick stands as an allegory to U.S polities at the time trying to stay neutral and not involves himself into the war affairs. I also think it's cool to point out that Humphrey Bogart himself was a decorated war veteran, and this is reflected in his performance. It wasn't until a former lover Norwegian Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) and her Czech Resistance leader husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) came into the bar looking for a way to escape Europe, where he states to question his beliefs. While most people know Casablanca as the exploration of the universal themes of love and sacrifice, people that look more into it viewed it as a political allegory about World War II. Ilsa can be seen as the wealthier of Europe who were able to escape due to their wealth, but whose warnings and pleas were dismissed in the late '30s and early '40s. Victor represents the poorer people of Europe who weren't able to escape and whose discovery prompted the change in attitude. When he appears, Rick finally grasps the true nature of what Ilsa is asking him. The film is set in Dec. 1941, the month in which the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor. That attack changed the course of American history, awakening the nation from political neutrality and thrusting it into the midst of World War II. By Illsa showing up, Rick become a symbol for America to take a stronger stand against the Axis Powers. The film also tells the story of another transformation, that of the local French commander of Casablanca, Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains). Claude Rains is the second best actor in the film besides Bogart. He plays the role so well. Louis begins the film as a pro-Vichy Nazi-appeaser but winds up a committed partisan of free France. Scenes such as Captain Renault throwing away the Vichy bottle it was meant to shown a rejection of Petain's puppet government. Even the great line near the end, 'I think this is a start of a beautiful friendship' stands for United States becoming allies with the French into stopping the Nazis. There is a great scene in the middle worth checking out, where the Germans start singing and, to combat it, the other patrons start singing the French national anthem was a truly moving part. The use of shadows and lighting makes this movie into one of the greatest film noirs. The use of the spotlight that shines from a tall tower and lights up the city of Casablanca reminds people that they are always being watched. It was a great use of light to represent fear and a threat. The music by Max Steiner was just amazing. The song ""As Time Goes By"" by Herman Hupfeld had been part of the story from the original play; Steiner wanted to replace it, but Bergman had already cut her hair short for her next role and could not re-shoot the scenes which incorporated the song, so Steiner based the entire score on it. So, without Bergman cutting her hair. We wouldn't have that theme. The theme of Sam's piano is the symbolic heart and soul of Rick's Café. All the guests want to sit beside it, because they want to forget their worries by listening. The piano suggests purity, which may be why Louis doesn't even think to look there for the letters of transit. I love the smart dialogue. The exchange between Rick and Louis were funny and brilliant. There is a few criticizes that need to be address. The usual conspiracy-theory gang likes to say that this movie was just propaganda. I didn't care if it's pro-Allied propaganda, it was a good movie. Some people think its basically a rip-off of a previous 1938 movie called Algiers. The writers took the character of Rick from the unproduced play, the theme ""As Time Goes By"" from a failed early 1930s musical and even parts of the dialogue were cannibalized from other unproduced scripts. It's doesn't bug me because it was mixed so well. I honestly don't see how the line 'Round up the usual suspect' is famous. It seems very not important from the rest of the best one liners. I believe Ingrid Berman delivering lines acting was mediocre at best. Her eyes did most of the work. Paul Henreid was indeed a stiff. Henreid did not get on well with his fellow actors and it shows. His character seem plain compare to the others. I didn't like how the movie treat the German actors in the film. The German actors had to keep curfew, as they were classified by the US as enemy aliens and under restrictions. They were frequently cast as Nazis in war films even with the fact that there weren't any uniformed German troops in Casablanca during WWII. Then there is the colorization controversy. Don't see it in color, its work best in Black and White. Trust me. Overall: The story itself is straightforward a realistic romantic movie with political allegory. The film's lasting enchantment is due to its dramatic conclusion and the theme of the inescapable past. The plane theme works because it was the escape of such memories. If you don't get onboard and see Casablanca. You might regard it. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.",Casablanca
67,kenjha,You Must Remember This,10,17 January 2010,"It doesn't get much better than this drama about war time intrigue and romance. Bogart gives the best performance of his storied career in the quintessential role of the tough, cynical loner with a soft heart. Bergman is simply luminous. Henried does well in a thankless role. Rains nearly steals the film as a crooked but lovable police inspector. The script has more memorable lines than any other, the cinematography is crisp, and nobody sings ""As Time Goes By"" like Wilson. Curtiz, an underrated director, deserves much of the credit for the iconic images of this unforgettable classic.

68,The-Sarkologist,A Film-noir classic,7,12 November 2011,"This is considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time. I loved this movie but I found that there is a lot of hype surrounding it. The hype does not say that the movie is better than it is, but rather tries to entice us to watch the movie when we don't need it. Casablanca can and does stand on its own. It is a movie that does not need advertising for if it appears on television people will watch it.The year is 1942 and France has fallen to Nazi invaders. People are fleeing Europe to America to escape the war and it is only through Lisbon that they can do that. So they go from Paris to Marselle across the Mediterranean and then across the Sahara to Casablanca where they catch a plane to Lisbon. Casablanca thus becomes a refugee city and a haven of pirates and thieves and people desperate to get to Lisbon. The only way out is by plane which is controlled by the local police through the Nazis. Casablanca is called neutral territory but in reality the Nazis have a lot of control over the city.The movie is based around a man named Rick (Humphery Bogart) who runs the Cafe Americain. He was a mercenary who fought for the Royals in the Spanish Civil War and ran guns into Ethiopia during the Italian invasion. He now sits in Casablanca, after fleeing France, remaining strictly neutral. The movie is about how Rick is pulled by both sides and the desire he has for a woman that is forbidden to him. A woman who he knew and lost in Paris and now returns with her husband. Rick is torn by anger and frustration with the woman that he loved who left him alone in Paris.Rick struggles with the side that he is on. He is a successful business man but he remains aloof from his customers. His only friend is the piano player Sam (though the line ""Play it again Sam"" does not seem to appear in the movie). He has been emotionally hurt by this woman and because of this he cannot have any other relationships. Yet we see his character change when the woman appears. The chief of police notice this when Rick sits down and has a drink with her and Victor Laslow, the head of the resistance. Rick struggles with love and hatred for this woman to come to the end realising that his love for her means that he wants her to be happy and that is to have her leave with Victor. Even though he wants her, and suggests betraying Victor so that he might escape Casablanca with her, he realises that he cannot and sends her off in the airplane at the end (though the airplane scene at the end isn't as sad as people have made it out to be).I don't think I need to say how great this movie is. It stands up on its own. It is a movie where the characters interact in a real way and grow and change. They have a solid background, one that rises up and brings them great pain when they face each other again. Casablanca is not as dark as the Maltese Falcon, yet it is a great movie and little more needs to be said.",Casablanca

'Casablanca' proves my point.How times - and film making - have changed over the years. 'Casablanca' so obviously was shot in a studio - so much so that it might just as well have been a stage play, almost entirely set in a cafe/casino. Very theatrical, actually. The film features the famed actors Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, and the famous line ""Here's looking at you, kid."" But what was the film actually all about? They keep talking about ""letters of transit"", but does the general public actually know what this means? What were these letters for?The film revolves around several people trying to obtain these letters, with everyone coming and going to Rick's Cafe. There was a lot of talk, and talk, and talk, and talk... there were some funny moments as well, but in general this was rather boring. If this was intended to be romantic, I'm sorry I didn't get it. Ilsa (Bergman) was having an affair with Rick (Bogart) while her husband, Victor (Heinreid) was in a concentration camp for a year. This is infidelity, for goodness sake, and this is supposed to be romantic??? I also found the film terribly over-dramatic.How did this boring, forgettable film become such a hit? There honestly is nothing memorable here. Maybe back in 1942 there was nothing better to watch, and this was considered romantic, who knows? From a modern point of view, though, this was a yawn of a movie with too much talk and too little going on, and constant soft lighting whenever Bergman was on screen to make her look like a goddess.

In 1982, Chuck Ross submitted the screenplay of Casablanca under a different name to 217 agencies as an experiment to see whether they would pick up on it. There were a range of reactions. Some agencies recognised it, but many rejected the screenplay with negative feedback. They said the dialogue was unconvincing, it dragged on, the story was dull and so on. The whole experiment was supposed to be an exposé of the industry itself - clueless agents who would never recognise a famous Academy-award-winning screenplay for what it is. However, in my opinion, the naysayers were actually right. The film isn't terrible, but it does have the alleged flaws - it is dull, unconvincing, hokey, slow and trite.

(whisper) And, don't tell the Guys; but it has all the markings of a ""Woman's Picture""!",10,8 December 2007,"Well now, let's begin at the beginning, for what do we say about this most favourtie all time Romance-Adventure that hasn't been said already? It seems that just about everyone has this at or near the top of their own list of films to own and watch over, now and again. And any commentary mad is complicated by the multi-plane storyline. On a seemingly lightweight amusement level, we have the story of a highly unique Night Club, ""Rick's Café Americaine."" It is owned and operated by the expatriate American, one Richard Blaine (Bogart). The Club owes its large and loyal crowd of supporters to the American Style of Music provided by the Orchestra, particularly by the Black American Pianist, Sam (Dooley Wilson). All would appear to be a fine, relaxing and enjoyable to pass some leisure time and forget one's mundane existence, even for a little while.But the Café is in the city of Casablanca, the principal city of Morocco, then a French Colony, in North Africa. Along with Tunisia, Algeria and French West Africa, Morocco formed a huge, contiguous French land mass which would be in control of the Vichy French Government. The what, I hear out there?Following the defeat of France and their surrender to Hitler, the Country was partitioned. The Northern part was designated as being Occupied France, being completely run from Berlin by Hitler. The Southern portion of the Country was designated as ""Unoccupied France"" and was allegedly free and independent. But it was proved to be anything but free and certainly not independent. It was headed up by the World War I Military hero; Marshal Petain (now considered to be a stone traitor). The new government was headquartered in the City of Vichy; hence, the term Vichy France or Vichy French. With all of that business attended to, we can now get on to CASABLANCA.OUR STORY..As we enter into the story, we find that the city of Casablanca is over-run with all ethnicities of Refugee people caught up in the Never-Never Land of the Post 1940 French era. All of this occurs after the Fall of France and their surrender to Nazi Germany. That subject matter alone would certainly be enough to give more substance (or even 'gravitas' *) to the story.That Casablanca had become a terminal for the unfortunate, but seemingly all Bourgeois Refugees, is a fact that turns its already Local Prefect of Police into more than his self- description as being ""a Poor, Corrupt Official."" As in any such degrading, seemingly hopeless situation, we see the heroic and the despicable side of humanity; one offering comfort and aid to those in need, the other feeding on their misery. In contrast to those who would flee, we have those who fight to make things better, the ""Underground"" movement. They are in evidence in the city, and hail from everywhere in war-torn Europe. All it seems are present in ""Rick's"". The initial important events of the story are revealed rapidly, which might leave on without the realization of their effect on the rest of the story. First, we see the Police Radio Operator and hear the All-Call bulletin reporting the murder and robbery of two German Couriers on board the Train from Oran to Casablanca. The other is the arrival of special German Envoy, Major Heinrich Strasser (Conrad Veidt) and his staff. The Double Homicide-Robbery was of interest, but mainly they are there to apprehend one Victor Laszlo ( Paul Henreid ), a fugitive from the Nazi Concentration Camps and Leader of the Czechoslovakian Underground.The Stolen Documents, ""2 letters of transit, signed by General DeGaulle"", are given to Rick by the perpetrator, one Monsieur Ugarte (Peter Lorre). Ugarte is arrested and killed by either the Casablancan Police or by Major Strasser's men, it's not clear whom. From then on it's all a matter of hunting the Letters, evading the Nazis and trying to figure out just who is the most treacherous; Monsieur Renault (Claude Rains), the Police Captain or Signore Ferrari (Sydney Greenstreet),the self-proclaimed ""leader of all illegal activity in Casablanca.We also learn that even those who are less than virtuous can be Heroic and even Patriotic. That applies to even ""just a poor corrupt Public Official"".NOTE: * Boy, I've wanted to use that word ""GRAVITAS"" ever since all of those news pundits said that V.P. Dick Cheney had it.

Which is possibly what makes him so perfect for Rick, in his Casablanca nightspot, on nobody's side.  He spars with Claude Rains (the crooked police captain) and Sidney Greenstreet (a rival bar owner) like a trooper, has a quiet contempt for Paul Henreid (a freedom fighter) and Peter Lorre (a thief), gives Conrad Veidt (the Nazi Major) as good as he gets, is on the level with employees Dooley Wilson and Cuddles Sakall.Through all this, truly loves Ingrid Bergman (the beautiful Ilse, the love of his life).

76,johnnyboyz,"A lot of people say: 'Casablanca is the greatest film ever'  Well, it's definitely one of them.",9,20 July 2006,"Casablanca has stood the test of time in a number of different ways. Given the time and circumstances under which this film was made, it's very easy to see why so many generations have warmed to it.Casablanca leaps into action very impressively; in-fact there is hardly ever a dull moment in this film, contrary to what some people say. The beginning is quick and sets everything up very nicely. We're made aware of the situation, the setting and exactly what goes on here. The little thing the narrator mentions about the German soldiers being killed and some papers missing whets our appetite. It stays at the back of our mind for a while. We also get a good look at our hero's bar/casino and what goes on/who goes there. It's done fairly quickly and very professionally. Never boring, and that's the key adjective to mention. In-fact, the amount of characters we are introduced to is rather effective as we don't really learn too much about them all at once, creating an eerie suspicion about them.The technique of building up a yet unseen character through dialogue is at large here, albeit briefly. The person in question is the eventual 'girl' of the film and we are told that she's been through hell already with a certain someone yet didn't leave them creating the atmosphere that she's someone special who sees things through to the end. This adds to the surprise our hero and us feel when we realise just exactly who it is.The hero's bar is the setting for most of the early exchanges and the mellow music that flows throughout is very nice and adds to the on screen atmosphere. The dialogue Rick (Bogart) is given also adds to the film as we're forced into believing he's a certain type of person: witty, cynical, quick and clever. He doesn't stray away from habits and routines, either. So, when the bombshell arrives and he's suddenly breaking these traits we've come to see him never stray away from, we know something's wrong. Something or someone has forced him into straying away from his own self and suddenly become more serious about things. The dialogue mentioned earlier has done its job and we're hooked.This is shown to us through an effective flashback sequence, which are memories in Rick's mind. The thing here in a filmic sense is that this could've happened at the start of the film, followed by a caption: 'xx years later'. The fact the makers didn't use this standard technique is evidence enough it's different for the good. Similar to 'Citizen Kane' a year earlier; the story is told, briefly, through means of time/space manipulation and it works very well if you've already been caught up in the film.Casablanca never wonders away from its story line or characters. The routine romance plot is maintained throughout and comic quips are thrown in as well once Rick is forced to change. With a script which has stood the test of time like no other and that feeling of tragedy and emptiness flowing throughout, it's no wonder 'we'll always have Casablanca'.",Casablanca
77,Petey-10,As time goes by...,10,1 December 2007,"You must remember this...Casablanca.A true classic from 1942 that introduces us Rick Blaine, a character made famous by Humphrey Bogart.Rick is the owner of ""Rick's Café Américain"" in Casablanca, Morocco.There is the war going on and the Nazis are causing trouble.One day his old flame Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) walks in with her husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid).The one woman he'd rather forget walks into his bar, back to his life.The woman that left him heart broken in Paris.Victor has seen the horrors of concentration camp and he might be going there again.He needs Rick's help.And so does Ilsa.Michael Curtiz is the director of this all-time classic.Humphrey Bogart is one of the coolest men that has ever walked upon this Earth.That's one reason why he's perfect in the lead of this movie.He speaks all his lines with such coolness no other man could ever do.And then there's Ingrid Bergman.In her these two qualities were combined: talent and beauty.Paul Henreid is very fine as Victor.The great Peter Lorre is Ugarte.Claude Reins plays Captain Renault in masterly way.The very good Conrad Veidt plays the bad Major Strasser and he does it with style.And then there's of course Sam who plays some classic tunes with his piano.He's played by Dooley Wilson.The beautiful Joy Page plays Annina Brandel, the young Bulgarian refugee.Madeleine Lebeau is also a real looker, and she plays Yvonne, Rick's soon-discarded girlfriend.Her husband of that time, Marcel Dalio plays Emil the croupier.Casablanca is very well remembered from its classic lines, including ""We'll always have Paris"".And you can hear Bogie repeatedly using the words ""Here's looking at you, kid"".It's been 65 years since this picture was made.As time goes by the respect only grows for movies like Casablanca.",Casablanca
78,leplatypus,It's true that Barb Wire is its rip-off (dad),7,16 October 2016,"Well, maybe it's not the expected way to talk about this movie but at last, it's objective and it's not the one-sided opinion about classic, cult, magic. In addition, it's great way to analyze movies evolution : so in the two movies, we have a frontier neutral town before liberty, bad guys and rebels, a saloon-keeper who doesn't take side, a police officer who is not very clean, a fat guy managing black market, two tickets for a plane and for sure an old love getting hot again ! With that, i would say that the most recent movie shows more but as it's silly contents (nakedness, violence), the effect to the movie is useless. Here, we just have the characters speaking and interacting in a civilized way, so the old movie is thousand more thrilling because it's only psychological ! So those old movies in black and white and using out-of-date technology are not finally boring but are rather more punchy than the actual ones because they cut to the essential : humans feelings and relationships ! Anyway, this old one has indeed a fabulous cast : as said by Lynch, it's true that Isabella looks like her mother, Bogart shows than less is more but for me, the magic lies with the black and white : it's so full, so complementary in costumes, the white saloon, the black night, the shadows that it was like seeing a color movie ! For sure as a french, i really appreciated when our hymn mutes Nazis songs and regarding to the date of production, i keep in mind the line « Even Nazi can't kill so fast », which was proved totally worst a few months later !!",Casablanca
79,TheMovieDiorama,Casablanca dances the war-driven night away with sweeping romanticism.,8,23 February 2019,"Another classic that many critics and cinephiles believe to be one of the greatest pieces of cinema ever. And much like 'Citizen Kane', I unfortunately was not overly enamoured by it. That's not to say I didn't like it, in fact I thought it was a very classy romance amidst the prickly politics of World War II. The drama just lacked, well, drama. Rick, a nightclub owner, reacquaints himself with his former flame in Casablanca, to which her husband happens to be a famed rebel wanted by Nazi officials, leaving Rick with an ultimatum. Remain bitter and see these two lovers split due to the Nazi regime, or provide assistance in helping them escape but remain broken-hearted.Set almost primarily in the club, director Curtiz successfully balances a variety of suave characters during a time of chaos. Refugees are overpopulating the city as they try to flee Europe, officials of the Third Reich wander the streets and local businessmen are constantly bartering with foreigners. The club and its customers acts as microcosm for the war, with the French consistently attempting to overpower the Germans and vice versa. Two opposing sides having to coexist in one large hall, with Rick acting as an overseer. The succinct dialogue and memorable quotes (""Here's looking at you, kid"") is all thanks to an adapted screenplay that essentially carries the film. Sure, Bogart and Bergman's performances were good, but they would not have got any recognition if it weren't for that beautiful script. It's easy to list everything that Casablanca does right, I mean we all know it's supposed to be one of the greats (and it is). Gorgeous cinematography, inventive scene transitions and wonderful tracking shots.But at no point did I feel that the characters were in danger or even remotely having any engrossing drama between themselves. After all, it's set during a devastating war, and strangely that historic event is put aside for the romance. Yes, it's a mature love story, and the film succeeds in that sense. However much of the focus was set on Laszlo, to whom I believe was underdeveloped. It's only during the last twenty minutes that certain plot details are set into motion, consequently making the preceding hour watchable but inconsistently paced. Rick's nostalgic flashback in particular skews the pacing and unfortunately is drawn out, in an attempt to lay the foundations of his romance with Ilsa.There is no doubt that Casablanca is an important film. It was back in 1942 and still is today. Yet the curse of having the acclaim of ""one of the greatest films of all time"" results in expectations never being met. Technically a perfect film, but lacks that ""oomph"" to push it even further.",Casablanca
80,damianphelps,Pretty 'Damn' Good,7,5 October 2020,This is an enjoyable movie that is packed with atmosphere. drama and a little romance!Its rimming with odd characters throughout the movie that add to the fantasy and mystery that is Casablanca.Bogart is an odd duck in this film and its his (to me anyway) slightly off beat and awkward performance that makes Casablanca noteworthy.A cool movie that deserves its place in movie history.,Casablanca
81,SAMTHEBESTEST,Every time i watch Casablanca it leaves me SPEECHLESS !,9,3 May 2020,"CASABLANCA (1942) :-Every time i watch Casablanca, it leaves me speechless. This isn't the first time i am watching Casablanca and i am not reviewing it in typical manners i do for other films but this is just an appreciational essay and haters please stay away. There has been so much said about Casablanca for 7 decades but when someone like me as an young audience in 2020 says that this film always leaves me speechless, you know something is more than special about this film. I have seen so many classic films from Hollywood and recently i have been watching daily 2-3 films during lockdown. Then i just thought, let's watch Casablanca again to realise what other films are lacking, and somehow i am intended to write these words not to review Casablanca but just to appreciate it little more.One thing i am sure about is, there will never be another Casablanca. For many reasons, Casablanca remains one and only of it's own kind. There were so many classics made on Love Story, Love Triangle, War, escape, Drama, Sacrifice and Emotions but none of them could make one perfect mixture of all them like Casablanca. The writing of Casablanca is a lesson for every writer who wishes to write an Intelligent film that will be remembered forever. The conflicts in Casablanca are summed up so cleverly. There is Love story, there is betrayal, there's Love Triangle, there's crime, there's Patriosm and then there is Mind Blowing climax that stayels with audience forever. I have always wanted to see at least one film that will use sentiments intelligently in the climax and my search ended with Casablanca. When everything seems like going Perfect in the film all you expect is a perfect Climax and Casablanca hits the best shot ever in those 15 minutes of Mind-blowing climax. It also taught some positive fellas that a sad, negative, intellectual and unparalleled ending works much better any typical happy ending. I don't think there will ever be any film which will beat those ""Intelligent Sentiments"" of Casablanca's Climax. And believe me nobody does it better than Humphrey Bogart.I just can't imagine anyone else saying, ""We will always have Paris"", and ""Here's looking at you kid"" the way Bogart did. I am still trying to understand that why didn't he won Best Actor at Oscars for Casablanca? Ingrid Bergman's character Ilsa is another fine example of classic writing. While most of the films make the woman look weak and dumb under love theories, here comes Ilsa the as one of the most balanced woman character ever. Ingrid Bergman just doesn't look Gorgeous but she performs gorgeously which is more important. There are several other important characters in the film like Victor, Renault, Ferrari and Sam. These characters are also written with same conviction despite the fact that these have minimal parts to play but they do leave an strong impact.Coming to the dialogues, Casablanca deserves one special seminar just to praise the Dialogues. I already mentioned two quotes from the climax but there are so many memorable quotes in the film. Even a small character like Sam went away saying one of the most honest and powerful dialogue, ""Please leave him alone Ilsa, you're a bad luck to him""I don't remember Michael Curtiz's name for any other film except Casablanca. He might have been unaware of what he was going to achieve with Casablanca but my friend nothing can beat the glory of people knowing your name for that one Masterpiece you make in lifetime.Films like Casablanca doesn't come often but when they come we must feel blessed. I was born in 90s, almost 5 decades after Casablanca but i still love this film more than any classic film of my era. The film has had an unmatchable impact over the years and i am sure it will continue having so even after completing 100 years. I am almost finished with most of Classics from 40s decade and there's no hesitation to say that, Casablanca is the Best film of 40s decade"". That's a big compliment when you know that it was the golden phase of Hollywood. If someday i catch a better film than Casablanca from 40s decade then I will surely let you know but for now this is it. A Masterpiece that changed typical mindset of Hollywood folks on Romantic Dramas, love trainglesa and noir (if i can say). Ask me anyday for a recommendation and Casablanca will always be there in my List. We will always have Casablanca in our hearts.RATING - 9/10*",Casablanca
82,funkyfry,Movie Magic,10,7 October 2002,"Suspenseful and romantic noir of the ""nice people stuck in exotic paradise with a bunch of thugs"" variety rises above its genre and its propagandistic aspects with tight direction, beautiful photography, an engaging story, and one of the best casts ever.  Bogart and Bergman's doomed love story is very effective, and there are some nice suspense scenes and very crisp dialogue in the best WB tradition.  Lovely to look at and enter into, Casablanca is to be experienced again and again in doses large and small.",Casablanca
83,Anonymous_Maxine,The ultimate classic,10,15 April 2008,"I believe it was Mark Twain that once lamented about his works being called classics, because in his opinion a classic is something that everyone respects but no one ever reads. Or watches, in the case of movies. To a certain extent I agree, because who other than English majors reads The Waste Lands or Heart of Darkness or Hard Times? And who really watches Citizen Kane or The Third Man or Casablanca for the entertainment value? Well, maybe more people than I think. The Third Man is a hell of a movie. For me, the first half or so of Casablanca was remarkably uninteresting, although the atmosphere created by the war taking place off screen is incredibly well done. I just hope I'm not becoming spoiled by modern film, that's one of my biggest fears.Casablanca is the last hope for people who can't get to Lisbon to escape from Europe as it descends into war, and because all of the dregs of European society (the people who can't afford to buy their way out) make their way by hook or by crook there, it becomes a sort of a prison where people wait for years for their chance to escape to America. The movie is so famous and such an enduring classic that it's almost impossible to write a review of it without mentioning some of the memorable lines, which are so famous that they have become a part of modern lore, like ""Here's lookin' at you, kid,"" and of course, ""Of all the gin joints in the world""It's hard to imagine the movie-making world in which the movie was made, but equally fascinating to learn that the people making the movie had no idea that they were making what would become one of the most popular movies ever made. It was a big movie, of course, but it was made on a relatively tight budget, which is something that I wish modern filmmakers would remember. Money has never been what makes great movies. Few people know that anymore.There is an intensely romantic story in the movie, what must be the best love story in a war film ever made, and it is remarkable how convincing and unpredictable it is. During the first half of the movie, it's easy to think that you can see exactly where it's going, which is most likely the reason I found parts of the first half slow and uninteresting. But soon there comes a point where you realize that you can't predict the ending. Specifically, this happens when we learn that Ilsa's (Ingrid Bergman) ""new"" love, the man for whom her romance with Rick (Humphrey Bogart  one of the biggest giants in film history) has to end, is really a good man. It's a strange love triangle between the three characters, one that many people may find morally repellent, but moving nonetheless. These are real people, not movie characters, and it seems that their amazing level of realism comes across on the screen so smoothly that it's almost by accident. Ultimately Casablanca is a story about painful sacrifice for the greater good, softened by the assertion that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. It's fascinating to consider the reality of that statement as we hurtle through the cosmos suffering the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. But as we try to find all the answers, it's nice to be able to look back to one of the most tumultuous times in modern history and see three people who know they have to suffer but know the reason why. So often we aren't afforded that luxury in real life.",Casablanca
84,imseeg,"What a joy to watch those faces, those beautifully photographed faces! I just keep clicking the pause button, only to admire that magnificent angelic face of Ingrid Bergman.",9,13 February 2019,"The story? Humphrey Bogart had a short affair with Ingrid Bergman. The 2 lovers parted abruptly and never saw each other again, untill they accidentally meet again in Casablanca during World War II. Will love blossom again?Wanna see a real black and white classic romantic picture? Look no further than ""Casablanca"". I dont usually get easily excited about romantic movies, but ""Casablanca"" is definitely something else and then some! What a powerful alluring romantic story, photographed in a way that is just breathtaking. I mean I just dont know the equal of it. Ingrid Bergman just looks so magnificently innocent and angelic, that I just keep on hitting the pause button almost every other 10 minutes when there is another still shot of her face to be admired. All the characters though are photographed in a way that is just to die for. What a terrific still shots. Heavenly!BEWARE: All considered, there is not a lot of romance to be seen in this movie to be honest. I am not kiddin. This may sound strange, because I just labeled it as a terrific romantic movie, which it is, but ""Casablanca"" starts out as a suspenseful cat and mouse game, between the german nazi's and a wanted resistance leader during World War II. NO romantic scenes whatsoever at the beginning. The romance part stealthily sneaks into the movie later on and builds up in strength only at the very end. But at the end, oooooh, waves of passion can be enjoyed!Highly recommended. You got to at least give this classic a try, BUT BEWARE: you must be patient, because ""Casablanca"" starts out quite slow, so dont expect fireworks from the beginning, but it only gets better and more dramatic and romantic near the end. And what a glorious romantic ending it is...",Casablanca
85,Vartiainen,Intriguing look at history,8,13 June 2016,"Casablanca was filmed and released before the end of World War II, making it an interesting time capsule. A look at history, at time period where everything hung on balance, where everything was uncertain. United States had already joined the war effort by this point, but there were still years of war ahead before victory could be claimed.And as it is, it really works. World War II provides the background, the drive behind almost all of the characters, but it's not really on the foreground. It's there, certainly, but the story is more about the characters than it is about the war. And I find that to be the right decision. These characters are driven to their breaking point by the war, but it's much more interesting for us to see what they do in that breaking point than it is for us to understand exactly what that point is.And the characters are really good. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are both phenomenal actors, legends of their field, and it really shows here. Bogart especially steals the whole show, and it's no wonder that the whole film is pretty much one iconic quote after another. The lines and deliveries are just that good.Casablanca is one of those films where everything just works. The story, the dialogue, the characters, the style, the pacing, the whole nine yards. One of the classics for a reason and definitely a must see film for all fans of the moving pictures.",Casablanca
86,weezeralfalfa,"An American in wartime Morocco: pretty good, but too many contrivances",7,11 March 2017,"I've seen this film, in part or whole, a number of times over the years. Used to be I thought it was pretty boring, until the climax at the end. Now that I analyzed it in some depth,I appreciate the whole film more, despite various major contrivances. I'm still not convinced that Humphrey Bogart was the right actor to play the main character: American, Rick. He was good in the climactic sequence, but often rather boring before that. I'm not sure how much was due to the script and how much was due to Bogie's basic personality. I suspect some of both. The plot is divided into 2 parts, both of which are relevant throughout most of the film to the end. There's the question of how Czech resistance fighter Victor Laszio(Paul Henreid) was going to get out of French Morocco, needing a letter of transit to do so. He was considered very dangerous by the Germans. Hence, they sent a patrol, headed by Major Strasser, to Casablanca, where they guessed he would end up, to make sure he didn't leave for a safe haven(the USA). Secondly, the present and future status of the past love affair between Rick and Scandinavian Ilsa(Ingrid Bergman), wife of Laszio, needs to be worked out. Rick and Ilsa had met in Paris, after it was reported that Laszio had been killed by the Germans. When the Germans were about to take over Paris, it was decided they needed to leave France. But, mysteriously, Ilsa didn't show up at the train station where she was supposed to meet Rick. He went south by himself, on to Morocco. Now, she showed up in his café with Laszio. Rick didn't find out until later that they were married before she met Rick, and she only learned that he was alive the day she was supposed to go with Rick. She explained to Rick that she didn't tell him she had been married because it was a secret to help protect her from harm by the Germans. This eased his mind somewhat. This type of love triangle is always difficult to work out, especially if the woman has married her new love: not a factor here. The screenplay keeps the audience guessing which man Ilsa will end up with, whether she makes the choice or it's made for her(it is). I think Ingrid was an excellent choice for Ilsa, having grown up in Scandinavia, her English speech was so European, and she was a lovely and good actress. The occasional close-ups of the faces, especially Ingrid's, helps to define their emotional state.The all important travel document which we are bothered with from the beginning to the very end was an invention of the script writer, having no historical relevance. In the first and last parts of the film, this document is called a letter of transit, whereas in the middle portion, it's called an exit visa. I'm assuming these are the same thing, but it unnecessarily confuses the audience(at least me).We have a fairly interesting group of secondary characters: not too many, and of various nationalities and allegiances relating to the war. Renault(Claude Rains), the French chief of police, says he doesn't have strong feelings about the Vichy vs. free French choice. He will bend with the prevailing wind. Rick similarly claims neutrality. But, like the US, still officially neutral, there are several indications that he's not as neutral as he claims.Clearly, Rick is very depressed about something through most of the film. His café seems to be thriving, so what is it? Partly, the uncertainty of the war, I believe. Also, the void in his romantic life after Ilsa disappeared. He hasn't found an adequate replacement, taking up with a floozy in the meanwhile, and uncertain about what Ilsa wants for the future. When Ilsa pulls a gun on him to hand over the letters of transit he inherited, he remarks ""Go ahead and shoot, you'll be during me a favor"". He's also cynical about the war, and the world in general. When Laszio answers ""If we stop fighting, the world will die"", Rick responds. ""What of it. That will put it out of its misery"". With his depression and cynicism dominating his personality, he's a hard man for audiences to like. That's a big problem with this film. But as Renault observes, despite his cynicism and depression, occasionally, he's a sentimentalist. This is shown when he orders the roulette wheel to be 'fixed' so that it comes up the number for a young Bulgarian refugee so that he will have the money to buy a letter of transit, so he and his wife can go to the US. Similarly, in finally providing letters of transit for Laszio and Ilsa, and giving up claim on Ilsa, he demonstrates compassion. ""Casablanca"" is not only a love story and wartime drama, it can be considered a musical! Of course, the most remembered song is ""As Time Goes By"". I was surprised to learn this song had been kicking around for a decade before. Of course, its inclusion in this film much increased its visibility. Another prominent song is ""Knock on Wood"": the only song specifically composed for this film. Then, there's the famous competition between the Germans, singing a German song, and the much more numerous other patrons of Rick's cafe, drowning them out with ""La Marseillaise"". Many others were played at least a little, mostly by Dooley Wilson, as listed under 'Soundtracks' at this site.",Casablanca
87,elshikh4,Falling in Love With a Movie !,10,26 October 2009,"OK, there are some movies that you love nearly every bit of them. Back to the Future, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, The Guns of Navarone, Annie Hall are few from my list. Casablanca maybe comes before all. It is pretty hard to say what's great in it, but anyway, let me elaborate from my heart on that.""A franc for your thoughts""I love humming birds, the taste of Mulukhiyah, the winter afternoon, my grandma's house, and this movie. There is Ingrid Bergman loving Humphrey Bogart while the music of ""You Must Remember This"" is on, so who needs more?!""It seems that destiny is taking a hand""It is my only time, yet, to watch one movie for more than 20 times (consecutively). Since the first meeting, February 1998, I'm crazy in love. I recorded the dialogue on a tape to listen to it for endless times, making a parody for maybe all the scenes, and writing about it as my favorite movie ever in the acceptance exam of the high cinema institute. Simply, this movie made me ask myself how they did it?, pushing me to study how they ""do"" it.""Round up the usual suspects""Here the formula magically worked. The drama, the actors and the music; everything and everyone clicked perfectly. The 10 out of 10 is being given to nearly all the elements. This is about to be the utopia of movies.I think that the cinema was so ahead of its time in this movie. For instance, the camera just moves in unusual ways for the early 1940s. I didn't feel any 40s, meaning the worst of the time, or even its usual stuff.What a story with complicated: global situation, love affair, and moral choice. You have to love the way all the characters pilgrimage to their noble truths at the very end. The way Rick Blaine, the anti-hero, becomes a hero. The way Captain Renault saves him as well. And the way they, Rick and Renault, find friendship in the last time, place and people.Btw, that *twisted* end was made during the shooting, to harmonize with the new political circumstance (Pearl Harbor). That could have turned it into loud naive patriotism, luckily it hadn't!""What an amusing little fellow""Rick is the man. Playing chess with himself, refusing the tune that tortures him, being the model slaughtered lover for the 20th century. He looks indifferent towards the tense circumstances, but basically he's an ideal romantic guy, who was shocked when knew that love couldn't be that ideal, personally and generally, in real life; so he acted as a stone, fighting for nothing, suppressing his heart to give him agony all the way. Though, lastly, his unspoken self-moralities end the situation philanthropically even if that meant more personal agony for him, to not represent the beauty of unexpected sacrifice inasmuch as alive yet hidden ideal man inside any of us. Remember too that we don't love Rick because he preferred the welfare over his happiness only, we love him because he tricked all the parties during the road to that as well!I can't forget the way Bogart throws his love's crying letter off the train, the way he sets smashed at the night of seeing Ilsa after many years, or the way he makes the ""hellabeans"" speech at the end. He was the prince of sadness on Casablanca's throne, the original Mr. exiled in the movies, and the guy who chooses Not to win the girl in the end. Bogart as Blaine, or Blaine as Bogart, is so-ugly-yet-so-noble-he's-more-charming-than-prince-charming. And if you looked up the source of this equation, then you've just found it!""I came here for the water!""This is a dialogue to be taught, with so serene comedy; it comes in certain places to lighten smartly the hard atmosphere. I'm fond of many clever lines and strangely I don't get board despite how many times I rehear them: ""I'm shocked, shocked to find that there was gambling in here / Your winnings sir / Thank you very much!"".""Play it""It got one perfect music score. And the song, ohh; with the warm voice of Dooley Wilson, it sums up the story of every movie and rather every life: ""Well, it's still the same old story. A fight for love and glory. A case of do or die. The world will always welcome lovers as time goes by"".""Here's looking at you, kid""I adore the ""He just a lucky guy"" situation & double-meaning remark. I know that my tears go while the last 10 minutes, not because the lead leaves his love, but because the rebirth of heroism inside of him, and the pretty solidness at portraying that cinematically in such immortal thrilling moments. Plus the last shot, in which Rick and Renault walk among the stars; this is one of the best endings ever.""A lot of water under the bridge""My friends used to hate me for talking about it non-stop, though, surprisingly, they loved it when saw it. It got me not seeing movies for nearly 8 months after I first watched it, according to hypnotizing feel it caused, and one real stunned question it gave: ""Is there any movie better than this?!!"". I hated only Paul Henreid's dryness, the fact that Bogart was shorter than Bergman so they had to hide that all the time, and the way anyone looks at this as ordinary movie. If only every movie tried to have something from it.""Does it got a wild finish?""Though I've loved a lot, but I think I've never loved a movie like I loved Casablanca. It makes the dream so true.",Casablanca
88,PWNYCNY,Don't make a remake!,10,15 September 2005,"There's a saying: ""If it ain't broken, don't fix it."" This saying is especially applicable to this movie. This movie is a timeless classic, which stands alone and cannot be replicated. I know that countless words have been written about this movie, so anything I say will probably be nothing new, but I'll say it anyway. This movie could have easily become some kind of corny and phony contrivance about some ex-patriot loser who is wallowing in self-pity because some woman led him on and then gave him the old ""heave-ho."" This movie could have easily become little more than just another World War Two movie, with the good guys vs the bad guys, with the latter getting everything they deserve. But this movie goes way beyond that, and is a work of art. Now this may sound like a cliché, but it isn't. This movie actually conveys a story that is both complex and compelling and contains some really great acting which transforms the script into something that the audience can actually listen to and follow without trying to figure out what's going on. Many of the characters in this movie are intrinsically unattractive and unlikable, but when mixed together, they emerge as some of the most memorable characters in the history of American cinema. I won't rehash this movie because anyone who knows cinema has undoubtedly already seen it. But suffice it to say, this movie is one-of-a-kind and should be treated as such.",Casablanca
89,ackstasis,"""I remember every detail. The Germans wore grey, you wore blue.""",10,11 June 2008,"Ah, 'Casablanca.' What other film can evoke such powerful feelings of nostalgia, can exemplify so completely the golden period of Hollywood film-making? The year was 1942, and the world found itself in the midst of the bloodiest conflict in modern history. Unlike anything our generation could possibly imagine, citizens were faced with an incredible uncertainty about their future. The Nazis marched across Europe, an astonishing, seemingly-unstoppable enemy, and the United States watched with bated breath from across the Atlantic. Most Hollywood productions responded to such ambiguity with fully-fledged, unabashed patriotism, and war-time filmmakers became obsessed with validating audiences' beliefs that the Allied forces would inevitably win out against Germany, and, indeed, many often concluded their pictures with unnecessary epilogues in which we've apparently already won. Such propaganda, while no doubt ensuring commercial success from war-weary cinema-goers, has regularly tarnished and outdated even the most otherwise-impressive contemporary WWII pictures, as the directors' willingness to simulate a happy ending strikes distinctly false from an era in which the overwhelming atmosphere was that of uncertainty and insecurity (see Billy Wilder's 'Five Graves to Cairo (1943)).This is not to say that 'Casablanca (1942)' is not a work of American patriotism; indeed, it might just be the greatest example. The film owes its enduring legacy to how seamlessly director Michael Curtiz, and his troupe of writers and actors, was able to encapsulate the sentiment of the time in which the picture was made. The story ends with Rick and Renault strolling resolutely into the thick mist, their futures obscured by the fog of uncertainty that hovers before their faces. What will the next few turbulent years have in store for these heroes? Will they be overwhelmed by the enemy, or continue their noble fight for freedom? Following Operation Torch, the 1942 Allied invasion of North Africa, there were plans to film one of those dreaded propagandistic epilogues, showing Rick, Renault and a detachment of Free French soldiers on a ship. Owing to Claude Rains' fortuitous unavailability for filming, the original ending was left intact, and producer David O. Selznick was never more correct than when he concluded ""it would be a terrible mistake to change the ending.""When 'Casablanca' was first conceived, the filmmakers apparently had little idea they were about to produce one of cinema's best-loved pictures. A prime example of the studio-bound exotica that was popular at the time, and obviously a war-time off-shoot of Howard Hawks' Colombian aviation adventure 'Only Angels Have Wings (1939)'  perhaps also John Cromwell's 'Algiers (1938),' which I unfortunately haven't seen  the film reproduced the stuffy, humid climate and seedy, corrupt personalities of Morocco on the Warner Bros. sets, which ironically communicate more romantic charm than the real location could ever have provided. The film was shot by veteran cinematographer Arthur Edeson, who had previously worked on the wonderfully-atmospheric 'All Quiet on the Western Front (1930),' 'Frankenstein (1931)' and 'The Maltese Falcon (1941).' His perfectly-framed photography suggests a mixture of stuffy melodrama, glamorous adventure and shadowy noir, though, interestingly, he avoids the sordidness of the latter style's successors, despite the wealth of suitably-seedy characters to be found in Casablanca. Framed through Edeson's lens, it seems that even the most squalid and repulsive of personalities can take on a curious facade of nobility.No less than six people had a hand in the film's justly-celebrated screenplay. The story was based on a then-unproduced play by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison, ""Everybody Comes to Rick's,"" and was adapted for the screen by Julius and Philip Epstein and Howard Koch, with uncredited input by Casey Robinson. The Epstein twins were initially keen to give the film a few comedic elements; this would, no doubt, have made for entertaining viewing, not unlike a Howard Hawks picture, but might have detracted from the story's core themes of love, loyalty, regret, moral responsibility and self-sacrifice. Koch had perhaps a clearer understanding of the director's preferences  another wonderful film from Curtiz, 'Angels with Dirty Faces (1938),' also poses a vital moral dilemma  and chose to focus largely on the politics and melodrama of Burnett and Alison's play. That so many conflicting artistic ideas somehow melded together, not only into a cohesive narrative, but also into history's greatest screenplay, is a miracle to be credited only to the cinema gods, particularly in view of the fact that Curtiz commenced filming with an incomplete script that was updated daily.Perhaps another possible explanation for the film's unlikely legacy lies with the distinguished cast, borrowed from all over Europe. Humphrey Bogart, Dooley Wilson and Joy Page were the sole American ""imports,"" and assorted supporting talents were plundered from the United Kingdom (Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet), Sweden (Ingrid Bergman), Austria (Paul Henreid), Hungary (Peter Lorre) and even Germany (Conrad Veidt). Bogart, who had been typecast throughout the 1930s as a lowlife gangster, had been given the opportunity to show some humanity in Raoul Walsh' film noir 'High Sierra (1941),' but it was 'Casablanca' that proved his first genuinely romantic role, and, with several notable exceptions, the remainder of his acting career would comprise of similarly-noble yet flawed heroes. Bergman, despite having a rather passive role, was never more enchanting than as Ilsa Lund, and, photographed with a softening gauze filter and catch lights, positively sparkles with gentle compassion and a tragic sadness. Perhaps it's just the romantic in me, but 'Casablanca' represents one of Hollywood's most unforgettable accomplishments. Even as the film draws to a majestic close, and two men forge a lifelong friendship in the fog-ridden uncertainty of War, we immediately feel like asking Sam to play it again just for old time's sake.",Casablanca
90,CubsandCulture,Mostly very good but the romance robs the intrigue...,7,7 October 2018,"While the love story between Rick/Ilsa is rather well done I feel that the amount of space it takes up is too much. Specifically there are two scenes early on that allow Rick to get the letters of travel and Victor to know of their location. Both scenes have to hang a lantern on the character motivations to make them believable. Unfortunately in retrospect it is rather obvious what the screenwriters ended up doing to get the plot to work. It makes the entire film feel a bit off.Similarly, while the love story is engaging, and this might be a consequence of the film's influence, it is no where near as engaging as the political intrigue. The film is at its best when the political context is at the forefront, such as the dueling national songs scenes. I was far more interested in how Rick and Renault navigate the German demands. The spy stuff is just better polished.It could be because I think Renault is easily the best part of this film. Rains is a delightfully self-aware cynic and there is a dark joy to that character. I wish the screenplay spent more time on him. Nonetheless this is a fine film and a classic of Hollywood.",Casablanca
91,estebangonzalez10,We'll always have Casablanca,10,21 June 2015,"""Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine.""This is another personal favorite of mine and perhaps one of the most quotable classic films of all time. Directed by Michael Curtiz, Casablanca takes place during the early days of World War II in French Morocco where many European refugees were searching for a way to escape to the Americas and evade Nazi control. In Casablanca we are quickly introduced to the owner of a nightclub, an American expatriate named Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart). Rick is a bitter and cynical man who has decided to look out for himself and offer his clients a good time at his club. But when a man shows up and gives Rick a couple of transit letters that will allow the holder of these papers to travel freely through Europe in order to escape to the United States from Lisbon, they know they can make a lot of money by finding the right buyer. A married couple show up at Rick's bar to buy the letters and this is where we discover why Rick is so bitter. Victor's (Paul Henreid) wife Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), had met Rick in Paris a while back when she thought her husband, a resistance leader, had been killed during the War. The two had an affair, but when Ilsa discovered that Victor was alive and that he had escaped the Nazi concentration camp where he was held she leaves Rick without giving him any explanation. Rick has never been able to get over the betrayal and seeing her at his joint with her husband makes him even more bitter. And so the adventure begins as Rick must decide if he wants to help Victor and Ilsa escape from the Nazis or if he should simply look the other way. Claude Rains has a supporting role as a corrupt French official while Conrad Veldt plays a Nazi Major.Today we all praise the screenwriters for this film, but there was much skepticism during filming. Neither Bergman nor Bogart thought it was any good and some claim that they didn't want to work together. I don't think Michael Curtiz ever imagined this film would become such a beloved classic either, but somehow the film clicked in all cylinders and the story has stuck with audiences ever since. The on screen chemistry between Bogart and Bergman is the main reason why the romance works so well and the scenes they ask Sam to play their song on his piano is memorable. It's the best romantic film of all time in my opinion because it has it all: romance, betrayal, and sacrificial love. There are so many beloved quotes in this film and it only gets better over time. The ending is also one of the best in any movie and one of the reasons why so many consider this such a revered classic, but I can point out several other emotional moments such as the scene where Sam is ordered to play a German patriotic song for the Nazi soldiers in the bar, only to have Victor respond by asking the band leader to play La Marseillaise and drown out the song from the Germans. Even the revelation scene where we get flashbacks of Rick and Ilsa's affair and discover how she never meets up with him at the train station and instead he's handed a farewell note from her, is quite emotionally engaging. The film offers plenty of thrilling scenes as well for those that aren't interested in the romance so there is no excuse for anyone not to see this classic. In case you forget how brilliant the screenplay is let me just remind you of some of the best quotes in this movie.""Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" ""If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it. Maybe not today. Maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life."" ""We'll always have Paris."" ""Here's looking at you kid."" ""Play it, Sam. Play ""As Time Goes By."""" ""I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue."" ""Alright, I'll make it easier for you- Go ahead and shoot. You'll be doing me a favor."" ""Round up the usual suspects."" ""Mostly I remember the last one. The wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look in his face because his insides have been kicked out.""

92,jimbo-53-186511,"It's not a bad film by any means, but the hype surrounding it is ridiculous",6,7 November 2014,"In some ways Casablanca is a very difficult film for me to review as there isn't really much technically wrong with it; it's well-scripted, fairly well-acted and the musical score is excellent. It's probably best to analyse this film by highlighting the good and the bad points of this film; What I liked about Casablanca in the first instance is the story; refugees who have come from different parts of Europe to the neutral safe haven of Casablanca which is in unoccupied French Morocco. In the beginning. we see snippets of various people who are desperate to leave Casablanca and we see these people have conversations with various people who are prepared to take bribes in order to fulfil their dreams of leaving Casablanca. Although Casablanca is an unoccupied area, refugees are still at risk of being forced into concentration camps hence their desire to flee for proper safe havens such as the US for example. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is an American expatriate who has fled occupied France and now runs a successful café/bar in Casablanca - he's a popular member of the community, but he becomes even more popular and important when several parties learn that he has acquired two exit visas - 1 of which is for Victor Lazlo (Paul Henreid) who the German Reich are very interested in and who are very keen on Lazlo staying in Casablanca. Blaine becomes pivotal to Lazlo's fate, but Lazlo's wife perhaps also proves pivotal to Blaine's fate as well. This creates a bit of a dilemma for Blaine which helps to increase the intrigue within the film. There was also the wonderful Dooley Wilson's portrayal as Sam - he only had a small role in the film, but I found him to be a warm and caring character and his voice was very soothing and I could listen to him sing 'As Time Goes By' all day - such a wonderful voice. So far, so good....What I didn't like about Casablanca was how contrived and far fetched the romance was between Blaine and Lund; they fall head over heels for each other in a few days so much so that even 2 years later Blaine can't look at another woman or develop any sort of a relationship with any woman whatsoever. Please? Give me a break!! Don't get me wrong. I know that romances like this do exist, but they're usually built up over a long period of time and will usually come through several years of life experiences. I found it hard to believe that they would love each other that much when they both admit that they barely know each other; think about it. Would you fall in love with someone who you barely know? Remember don't confuse 'love' with 'lust'. It also didn't help that the film was pretty much devoid of any sort of tension or conflict - considering it is billed as a Drama, I didn't see much on screen that could be classed as Dramatic. Factor all of this with three unlikeable leads and you've got yourself a very flawed film (note that I said 'flawed' rather than 'bad').Casablanca is a film that is worth watching, but you really need to ignore the hype and judge it on its own merits. If you're a sucker for a nice war time romance then this will do the trick. However, if you look at it a bit deeper, you will see the good, but somewhat 'flawed' classic that I watched.",Casablanca
93,smatysia,Here's looking at Ingrid Bergman,10,30 November 2004,"Wow! Ingrid Bergman was at her best in this one, as well as her most sad, doe-eyed, beautiful. The part of Rick seemed made for Bogey, with the snappy repartee, and the cynical shell around what Renault refers to as ""a rank sentimentalist"". It seems like every time I see this film I notice something new. This time it had to do with the Bulgarian woman, Annina Brandel, who Rick rescues from the carnal plotting of Captain Renault. I never gave this scene much thought, just assuming that it was a way to plumb the limits of Rick's cynicism, as noted above. But later, during the scene where Ilsa tells Rick that she'll stay with him if he will use the letters of transit for Laszlo, I realized that the two scenes were a common theme, that Rick realizes he'd be no different from Renault if he followed through with that. I guess one gets lazy seeing modern Hollywood fare. Nowadays, the director would have used a flashback image or something, in order to bludgeon the viewer with the correlation. But back then, with a better-educated public, one could allow audiences to discover things for themselves. It was also skillful how these films could be more or less suitable for children, as well as adults. When I saw this film as a child, it never occurred to me that Rick and Ilsa had had sex. But the clues, while too subtle for a child, were pretty obvious to me as a man. Like many people this film is my all-time favorite. Grade: A+++++",Casablanca
94,Nazi_Fighter_David,Cinema par Excellence!,10,28 November 1999,"Michael Curtiz's ""Casablanca"" opens on maps while a narrator gives a detailed exposition of the many twists and turns of Casablanca in the French Morocco, as a refugee route from wartime Europe...The Nazi envoy, Major Heinrich Strasser puts it: 'Human life is cheap in Casablanca."" Of course because a man may be executed in its crowded market before Marshal Pétain's portrait or where a charming girl may guarantee an exit visa by spending her night with the Prefect of Police...Rick's Café is the point of intersection, the espionage center, the background for Allied offensive, the focal point as refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe seek to gain exit visas to Lisboa... The interesting club so well organized, leads to an open arena of conspiracy, counterspies, secret plans, black market transactions, in which the games and fights are between arrogant Nazis, patriotic French, idealists, murderers, pickpockets and gamblers around a roulette wheel, where a ball could rest on Rick's command against the settled number 22...""Casablanca"" is an adventure film which victory is not won with cannons and guns... The action, the fight, the war takes place inside Rick's walls rather than outside...But who is this Rick? What is his magical power? His secret weapon? Rick is the anti-fascist with hard feelings, the former soldier of fortune who has grown tired of smuggling and fighting, and is now content to sit out the war in his own neutral territory... Even loyalty to a friend doesn't move him as he refuses to help Ugarte, a desperately frightened little courier who is fleeing from the police...Emphatically, Rick says, ""I stick my neck out for nobody."" But we know he will do just that in a very short time, for into his quiet life comes a haunting vision from his past, the beautiful woman he still loves and bitterly remembers... She is married to an underground leader and she desperately needs those papers Rick conveniently now has in his possession... The cynical Rick's facade of neutrality begins to weaken as he recalls the bittersweet memories of his past love affair, memories triggered repeatedly when the strains of ""As Time Goes By"" come from Sam, his piano-playing confidante...But ""Casablanca"" basic message is a declaration of self-sacrifice... War World II demanded all! The words stated by Rick at the airport had their impact: 'The problems of three people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.' It goes without saying that Bogart is incomparable when he seems most like himself... His way with a line makes ""Casablanca"" dialog part of the collective memory: 'I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray. You were blue.' Intermixed in this intrigue are all the fascinating and beautifully acted supporting roles With his customary skill, Claude Rains plays Major Renault, a prefect of police who is like Bogart in many ways... He, too, claims neutrality, but is definitely against the Nazis... He is Rick's most devoted adversary, tauntingly calling the man a ""sentimentalist"" and delivering his share of cynically amusing lines... When he makes a small bet and is encouraged to make a bigger one, he remarks that he is only a ""poor corrupt official."" Ingrid Bergman is fascinating as the lovely heroine, the mysterious impossible woman of an impossible love, the tender mood of every man, the love-affair, the quality of being romantic, the traditional woman enclosed by two rivals, symbol of a besieged Europe...Paul Henreid is Victor Laszlo, the anti-Nazi resistance leader, seeking in Morocco the two letters of transit signed by General De Gaulle...Sidney Greenstreet is the black marketeer on good terms with Rick, the rival owner of the 'Blue Parrot,' the acceptable face of corruption...Peter Lorre is Ugarte, the racketeer, the dealer of anything illegal, the killer, driven into a corner by the Vichy police, who has given Rick two letter of transit...Conrad Veidt is the very essence of German rigidity, unfeeling, unconcerned about life, but firmly believing in the foolish ideology of his Nazi compatriots...""Casablanca"" covers many highlights: The Marseillaise against the Horst Wessel song inspiring sequence; the blissful days in Paris; Ilsa's emotional words to Rick in occupied Paris; the champagne toast; Ilsa's request to Sam; the poetry of the magic words and the beautiful voice of Dooley Wilson; Captain Renault's words in the airport; and the farewell...The magic that developed from the teaming of Bogart and Bergman is enough to make a new romantic figure out of the former tough guy... To his cynicism, his own code of ethics, his hatred of the phoniness in all human behavior, he now added the softening traits of tenderness and compassion and a feeling of heroic commitment to a cause... They helped him complete the portrayal of the ideal man who all men wished to rival...One can look at hundreds of films produced during this period without finding any whose composite pieces fall so perfectly into place... Its photography is outstanding, the music score is inventive, the editing is concise and timed perfectly... Bogart's and Bergman's love scenes create a genuinely romantic aura, capturing a sensitivity between the two stars one would not have believed possible...""Casablanca"" is a masterpiece of entertainment, an outstanding motion picture which brought Bogart his first Academy Award nomination (he lost to Paul Lukas for ""Watch On the Rhine"") and won Awards for Best Picture of the Year, Best Director and Best Screenplay...",Casablanca
95,AAdaSC,Start of a beautiful friendship,8,14 September 2015,"Humphrey Bogart (Rick) and Sydney Greenstreet (Ferrari) each own a café/bar in Casablanca which is frequented by those wishing to make an exit to Lisbon and a new found freedom. Casablanca is on French soil and Claude Rains (Renault) is the Captain in charge who must co-operate with Nazi Conrad Veidt (Strasser). The two cafes are riddled with black market shenanigans and into this town wanders Resistance leader Paul Henreid (Victor Lazlo) and Ingrid Bergman (Ilsa). In order to make it to freedom, an exit visa is required and this is what Henreid and Bergman are after.An entertaining film with a good cast and very amusing dialogue. Bogart rattles off some classic lines but it's Claude Rains whose delivery tops the charts. One moment that I found funny is when a grateful couple approach him and enthusiastically let him know that they will be at his office at 6:00am to collect their visas. ""I'll be there at 10:00"" is his reply. The moral of that is don't be so keen, it gets you nowhere. A good lesson for anyone starting a new job.""Here's looking at you"" gets a bit clichéd but it doesn't matter. I never cared for Humphrey Bogart and his man who stands alone image. It always struck me as cold and unpleasant. However, I'm starting to really like him these days.One daft thing about the film is how the Nazis didn't find the visas. The hiding place is pretty obvious if you ask me.

99,slokes,The Fundamental Things Apply...,10,16 January 2005,"""Casablanca"" remains Hollywood's finest moment, a film that succeeds on such a vast scale not because of anything experimental or deliberately earthshaking in its design, but for the way it cohered to and reaffirmed the movie-making conventions of its day. This is the film that played by the rules while elevating the form, and remains the touchstone for those who talk about Hollywood's greatness.It's the first week in December, 1941, and in the Vichy-controlled African port city of Casablanca, American ex-pat Rick Blaine runs a gin joint he calls ""Rick's Cafe Americaine."" Everybody comes to Rick's, including thieves, spies, Nazis, partisans, and refugees trying to make their way to Lisbon and, eventually, America. Rick is a tough, sour kind of guy, but he's still taken for a loop when fate hands him two sudden twists: A pair of unchallengeable exit visas, and a woman named Ilsa who left him broken-hearted in Paris and now needs him to help her and her resistance-leader husband escape.Humphrey Bogart is Rick and Ingrid Bergman is Ilsa, in roles that are archetypes in film lore. They are great parts besides, very multilayered and resistant to stereotype, and both actors give career performances in what were great careers. He's mad at her for walking out on him, while she wants him to understand her cause, but there's a lot going on underneath with both, and it all spills out in a scene in Rick's apartment that is one of many legendary moments.""Casablanca"" is a great romance, not only for being so supremely entertaining with its humor and realistic-though-exotic wartime excitement, but because it's not the least bit mushy. Take the way Rick's face literally breaks when he first sees Ilsa in his bar, or how he recalls the last time he saw her in Paris: ""The Germans wore gray, you wore blue."" There's a real human dimension to these people that makes us care for them and relate to them in a way that belies the passage of years.For me, and many, the most interesting relationship in the movie is Rick and Capt. Renault, the police prefect in Casablanca who is played by Claude Rains with a wonderful subtlety that builds as the film progresses. Theirs is a relationship of almost perfect cynicism, one-liners and professions of neutrality that provide much humor, as well as give a necessary display of Rick's darker side before and after Ilsa's arrival.But there's so much to grab onto with a film like this. You can talk about the music, or the way the setting becomes a living character with its floodlights and Moorish traceries. Paul Henreid is often looked at as a bit of a third wheel playing the role of Ilsa's husband, but he manages to create a moral center around which the rest of the film operates, and his enigmatic relationship with Rick and especially Ilsa, a woman who obviously admires her husband but can't somehow ever bring herself to say she loves him, is something to wonder at.My favorite bit is when Rick finds himself the target of an entreaty by a Bulgarian refugee who just wants Rick's assurance that Capt. Renault is ""trustworthy,"" and that, if she does ""a bad thing"" to secure her husband's happiness, it would be forgivable. Rick flashes on Ilsa, suppresses a grimace, tries to buy the woman off with a one-liner (""Go back to Bulgaria""), then finally does a marvelous thing that sets the whole second half of the film in motion without much calling attention to itself.It's not fashionable to discuss movie directors after Chaplin and before Welles, but surely something should be said about Michael Curtiz, who not only directed this film but other great features like ""Captain Blood"" and ""Angels With Dirty Faces."" For my money, his ""Adventures Of Robin Hood"" was every bit ""Casablanca's"" equal, and he even found time the same year he made ""Casablanca"" to make ""Yankee Doodle Dandy."" When you watch a film like this, you aren't so much aware of the director, but that's really a testament to Curtiz's artistry. ""Casablanca"" is not only exceptionally well-paced but incredibly well-shot, every frame feeling well-thought-out and legendary without distracting from the overall story.Curtiz was a product of the studio system, not a maverick like Welles or Chaplin, but he found greatness just as often, and ""Casablanca,"" also a product of the studio system, is the best example. It's a film that reminds us why we go back to Hollywood again and again when we want to refresh our imaginations, and why we call it ""the dream factory."" As the hawker of linens tells Ilsa at the bazaar, ""You won't find a treasure like this in all Morocco."" Nor, for that matter, in all the world.",Casablanca

102,Steffi_P,"""Who's got trouble? We got trouble.""",10,27 October 2010,"For the Allies, 1943 was perhaps the grimmest and most desperate year of the war, as the conflict threatened to grind on into stalemate. Back on the home front, movie production was responding appropriately, cutting back on the flag-waving calls-to-arms, and making pictures that were more about hope, endurance, and getting on with life during a state of war. This is where Casablanca fits in.Everybody knows about Casablanca – even people who think they don't will probably be tacitly aware of its many quotable lines. Why has the picture become such a cultural monument? The reasons are many, but that quotable script is as good a place to start as any. Casablanca is based on a (then un-produced) play by Murray Bennet and Joan Alison, which provided the outline. However it was given its Hollywood makeover by celebrated screen writing twins Julius and Philip Epstein, whose best picture up to this point had probably been The Strawberry Blonde (1941) with James Cagney; a witty, rather sentimental and very musical period piece. The Epsteins have brought many similar touches to this picture, especially their approach to music and comedy. Many of the key moments have a musical underpinning; not just the recurring love theme ""As Time Goes By"", but the playing of the Marseilles to drown out the Nazis, or the ""Knock on Wood"" number which is played in the first scene at Rick's, and very much establishes the atmosphere of the joint. The Epstein brand of humour doesn't rely on a handful of ridiculous and exaggerated characters, as was the usual at this time. Instead, the jokes all arise from normal things that we might laugh at in real life, such as the market trader reducing the price when he realises Ingrid Bergman is ""a special friend of Rick's"". This sort of thing is crucial for Casablanca, because it allows a little touch of humour without robbing the story of its dignity or credibility.Then there is the director Michael Curtiz, a man who has not been deified by the magic wand of the auteur theory, and yet one whom any serious film scholar is forced to pay attention to simply because of the number of important pictures he helmed. Despite this being his best-known picture, he is himself better known for the series of swashbucklers he made with Errol Flynn in the mid-to-late 1930s. It is true that Curtiz's style tended to be very technical, and certainly his most noticeable work has been in the action genre, so as such his having directed Casablanca is seen as being coincidental to its success. Still, his shrewd mechanical mind has added a thing or two to this picture. Take that opening shot of the city, panning down from the mosque tower into the busy street. It's a complex, cluttered shot, but it really gives us a feel for the location and that tense atmosphere, with great touches like those two extras bickering in the foreground. A lot of Curtiz pictures begin with a shot like this – crowd scenes that look completely random and extremely realistic, and yet are full of meaning and rich in detail. Curtiz was also not quite the mean-minded movie-making machine that he is sometimes painted as. He did have a feel for romance and sentiment if it was a picture that relied upon it. Casablanca features quite a few uncomplicated close-ups of characters in emotional intensity, just about the only uncluttered shots you get in a Curtiz movie, and they are incredibly moving.But of course, what would these close-ups be if they weren't of great actors? Casablanca has a flawless cast, but also a very bold one at the time. Humphrey Bogart was only just starting to play leading roles, and even then he was generally an anti-hero. However, Casablanca solidified his screen-persona, a tough individualist on the outside, but a good man at heart, albeit one loathe to reveal it. By showing that there was a human side to his charismatic demeanour, he gave his best performance to that point. Bergman too was just on the cusp of stardom, but she pulls off a role of frailty and tearfulness without getting hysterical, as many a lesser actress would have done. And then there is Claude Rains, one of the few long-established players in the picture. Rains is playing his usual type – perhaps his archetypal role – and it is actually one not unlike Bogart's, with the crucial difference being that Rains revels in his amorality. And yet Rains's art is that he makes this character, who is utterly despicable on paper, likable on screen.On that note, it's tempting to view Bogart and Rains as the two leads – not Bogart and Bergman. It is Bogart and Rains whose story arcs deal with the main theme of Casablanca – whether to strive for individual gain or to fight for the good of the people. And this is after all a movie about people, and hope in the unity of people. There is this feeling of people brought together by their desperate situation, which permeates Rick's and the picture in general, and it's something writers, director and cast have all contributed to. It makes us feel that the struggles of every minor player – Peter Lorre's nervous underground agent, Joy Page's young wife desperate to escape the city, S.Z. Sakall's jovial headwaiter, the sadly-unsung Dooley Wilson – are as important and immediate as those of the lead players. It is perhaps more than anything else this rich humanity that made the picture connect with wartime audiences, and has made it a work of power and resonance ever since.",Casablanca
103,truemythmedia,Overlooked by Modern Americans,10,15 August 2019,"I love this film. It isn't my favorite movie nor even in my top 100. It's beautiful but it isn't the sort of movie that I typically care for. It's primarily a love triangle that could essentially be straightened up by a single conversation. It's super nationalistic and earnest without a lot of the complicated characters that I tend to like.Yet, somehow it is a movie I don't just like but love. It is a film that is emblematic of several things that I enjoy looking back on.The first of these is the Hollywood studio system. Once it crashed in the 70s for the rise of auteurs and less polished clean films films produced in the style of Classic Hollywood went away forever. There were certainly a lot of things about Old Hollywood that needed to go: the way they controlled people, the racism, and the sexism; but there was also a sort of magical quality back when everyone was going to see the same couple of movies over and over again. A communal experience in film that is only likened to today in films such as ""Avengers: Endgame."" Here is a film that was worthy of being seen by everyone.It has the polish of masters of their trades working to achieve perfect shots, perfect performances with a crispness that only fails when it is intentionally dropped to give the old soft fuzzy look to Ingrid Bergman's close ups.Pointing to the film and trying to call out any one aspect of the film as special is difficult because every aspect of it is done so perfectly. Can you call out the acting and leave out the cinematography, or the direction, or the editing?Another thing this film does is remind me of a time when America was busy sacrificing individual comforts, preferences, freedoms, and even lives for the sake of something larger than themselves. These days that seems in short supply. It doesn't seem outlandish to think that if they remade this film (and don't you think for a second that they wouldn't if they thought it would make money) today it would end with Rick (Humphrey Bogart, ""The Maltese Falcon"") and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman, ""Notorious"") flying off together to a new life and romance.""Casablanca"" is a great example of something I believe is quite tragic about modern movie watchers, though it is probably inevitable. It's a film that is utterly beautiful and full of meaning and entertaining yet most people won't watch it because it is old. I am a fan of old things and one of those weirdos that are always talking about the things that we are forgetting from our past.There are many things about the past that we should grow beyond but ""Casablanca"" shouldn't be one of them. It may not have a crazy shootout at the end, snappy curse laced dialogue, or sizzling stars baring it all, but it has stood the test of time for a reason.",Casablanca

109,pachara87,Every kid should see this Bogart classic.,9,21 February 2019,Even hardened cynics who might be impelled to dismiss it as a collection of button-pushing clichés will most likely get swept up in the all the unabashed romance.,Casablanca
110,davidmvining,One of the greatest studio films,10,21 November 2019,"Out of all the movies in my top ten, this is probably the one that pops up most in others. It's been a staple of American cinema pretty much since its release and when it won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1942. It's well loved by nearly everyone who sees it, and I think it's easy to see why.In my mind there are two major reasons why both I love this film and why it's so beloved 76 years after its release: dialogue and the expert mixture of cynicism with romanticism.First Things FirstThe movie nominally takes place in the city of Casablanca during World War II, but it's a version that seems fairly divorced from reality. The central plot device in the movie are a pair of letters of transit signed by Charles de Gaulle that will allow anyone carrying them to leave the city on the plane for Lisbon where they'll be able to find a way to America. The letters of transit were a complete fabrication of the writers of the original stage play that the movie was based off of.The movie's larger geopolitical picture is, quite simply, a fantasy. It makes a certain amount of sense that the wildly corrupt Free French prefect would allow almost anything to happen in the city as long as he got his cut, but the Nazi presence feels almost benign compared to what one might expect from what a Nazi would actually do with that kind of presence in a city and confronted with possibly losing a high priority target like Victor Laszlo.But, that's not the point. Casablanca isn't about World War II, the political realities of the war, or even the relationship Free France had with Nazi Germany. No, the movie is about two people, and those around them that affect their relationship.DialogueThat being said, I'm hoping we all know the story of Casablanca, so I'm going to skip a plot summary. Instead, I'm going to dive into the qualities that have helped the movie last so long.Apparently, the cast thought the dialogue was silly and unnatural as they filmed it. One thing's for sure, no one speaks with this much wit in real life.The script for Casablanca is the sort of high-octane, clever, dialogue driven script no one really writes anymore. Diablo Cody was in the same league with Juno a while ago, but audiences seem to want naturalistic dialogue in most circumstances. They'll allow some room for things like period pieces, but overall there's an insistence that everyone talk like they would in real life.Which is a shame, although if everyone had the kind of constant one-liners that Rick, Ilsa, and Renault life could be significantly more fun.The movie is well-known for its great exchanges, having six quotes in the AFI's list ""100 Years...100 Quotes"", more than any other movie in the list. There's the simple stuff like ""Here's looking at you, kid,"" (an invention of Humphrey Bogart as he taught Ingrid Bergman English on set), but Claude Rains' Renault has all of my favorites. Out of context, the ""shocked"" line is funny for the pure absurdity of it, but in context it's even funnier.I also love Renault's response to Rick threatening to shoot him in the heart as his least vulnerable spot. The movie is stuffed full of this fantastic sort of stuff that makes just listening to the dialogue a pleasure on its own outside of any other parts of the film.
Cynicism vs. RomanticismI think this is really why the movie endures through the decades. It portrays a rather complex portrait of balancing the cynicism brought upon by loss and melancholy with the need for Romanticism in the world.Rick starts the film as, what looks like, a pure cynic. He doesn't talk about his past and seems only concerned with keeping his bar open in such a tumultuous city with such a (poor) corrupt official in Renault. In the opening act, though, we see signs that there's more to him than that. Renault talks about some of Rick's past. He participated in two smaller wars by running guns, and in both the side he chose lost. The implication is that Rick was a romantic, but his behavior in the scene is designed to make it look like he's left it all behind. He says, ""I stick my neck out for nobody,"" twice in the first twenty minutes.
All things considered, he probably would have continued on this path with the kind of behavior that leads him to idly stand by as a man he's friendly with is rounded up and taken away to surely be shot, but the source of his cynicism arrives. Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) arrives in Rick's place and Rick immediately begins to change. He drinks with customers (which he never does), he helps a young Bulgarian couple win at his own roulette tables so the young woman won't have to sell her body to Renault for the help they need to leave Casablanca.Eventually, it all culminates in that side of Rick, that he has tried to suppress for years since Ilsa left him to return to her presumed dead husband Victor Laszlo, completely taking over. He removes himself from his shell and becomes completely selfless. Instead of using the letters of transit for himself, he gives them to Laszlo.This move could mean one of two things, both related. It could mean that Rick has become a patriot, as Renault calls him, and is now fighting for a cause much like he used to, but it could also mean that he simply knew that Ilsa would never be happy with Rick if she knew that Laszlo was dead. He'd have her, but he'd be the architect of her husband's death. There couldn't be any love there, so he does what's right and walks away. The yearning to be a better man amidst a hostile world is appealing to many people.Casablanca 2: Electric BugalooLet me take a moment to talk about the very end of the movie. Ilsa and Laszlo have flown away. Rick has shot the main  character. Renault has covered for Rick's actions, and the pair walk off into the fog, beginning a beautiful friendship. I don't want to be the ""get off my lawn"" cynic, but if that got made today there'd be work on a sequel before the movie opened, just in case it was successful. That sequel would possibly put Renault as the main character because he'd test really well in screenings, and Rick and Ilsa would end up together.
It wouldn't destroy the original, but it'd spit on it.The beauty of that ending is that it allows us to imagine what could be, but also it ends that part of Rick's story at the exact right moment. He's completely changed from cynic to romantic, and we don't need to see anymore.
Warners wanted a sequel immediately after release (called Brazzaville), but they never made it. Also, can you believe that Madonna tried to remake it once? Ashton Kutcher would have been Rick. At least studio executives have one movie they refuse to try and remake, at least for now.The Studio SystemThe making of the movie, which seems to wonderfully designed and assembled, was apparently a mess. Aside from the aforementioned distaste the actors had for the dialogue, there is the famous story of Humphrey Bogart being called to set to stand in a place and nod, for a reason he had no idea. It ended up being Rick telling the band to play the Marseilles. There were also rumors of multiple endings for a while that are largely untrue (although this joke from The Simpsons always puts a smile on my face), but there was an attempt to extend the ending with shots of Rick and Renault on an Allied ship invading North Africa (ugh, just try to ruin everything why don't you). I'm glad Claude Rains was apparently unavailable.But, it was a studio picture and probably the best example of what the studio system did well. They had contract players they just pulled into pictures they thought would fit, hired directors who were technically competent and unflashy, and writers who could churn out quality work. When this system came together well, it ended up creating absolutely wonderful entertainments. It's not how every movie should be made, but it could work very, very well.",Casablanca
111,Spleen,The best of a kind,9,16 April 2002,"Spoilers ahead.I didn't understand the film properly until I read Danny Peary's essay on it in the first of his three ""Cult Movies"" books (which, by the way, you MUST read, although you should be aware that Peary's complaints about ""The Red Shoes"" aren't even near the mark).  The key (and, in retrospect, obvious) insight is this: all along, Captain Renault WANTED Rick to become a hero again.  As long as Rick was content to adopt a cynical, self-serving attitude, Renault, a man made of lesser material, had an excuse to do the same - and he wanted that excuse to be denied him.  When it WAS denied him he was delighted.  THAT'S he joined the side of the angels, without even hesitating.  (It's also why he spent so much time earlier poking fun of Rick's former idealism, in an attempt to get Rick to defend it.)  This probably strikes many people as obvious; I regret to say I had to have it pointed out to me.I don't have to argue that this is a great film.  We all know it is.  Peary calls it the ONLY film that's everything the old-style studio films were trying to be, and he's probably right.  This doesn't, of course, mean that it's the BEST film of the 1940s; better still are the bolder, more ambitious productions made by more inspired directors: ""Citizen Kane"", ""The Red Shoes"", ""Fantasia"", and so forth.  But ""Casablanca"" is probably as high as it is possible to fly without making a Philistine studio executive reach for his heart tablets.  This is higher praise than it sounds.  And if you think it IS the best film of the 1940s, after all ... well, I can see your point of view.",Casablanca

113,onepotato2,Idealism behind cynicism,8,26 May 2008,"When I first saw this as a young film snob, I liked it, and said it was important, but I didn't really know as much about human emotions, or the topics depicted as I thought. I found some scenes (the ones I was too young to understand) to slow it down; the ""morning after"" dialog at the bazaar, the sale of the club to Greenstreet. All I really knew was that the surprise ending was regarded as a sentimental powerhouse.Now I find its storytelling structure to be so sleek and on-track that I seriously doubt the lore that says that pages of the script only arrived minutes before they had to be shot. It is a speedy, singular-minded machine that doesn't have an ounce of fat, that manages to be Bogart's best role and performance to boot.Fans attend viewings to hear iconic lines within a context that ingeniously frames its well-known, pithy phrases in relation to selflessness, patriotism and sentiment. The electrifying smack-down of the Nazis delivered to 'Le Marseilles' is one of the most rousing moments ever put on film. And it's kept in good company by boatloads of other famous scenes.It portrays patriotism in terms of idealism (not narrow-mindedness, victimization and/or hate) so even a liberal (the more idealistic of the two political viewpoints) can love it.

Also it offers a different look at the war environment, which through Morocco's Casablanca buffer state. which offer the condition where Nazi officials and resistance members can face one another without necessarily fearing an immediate shootout.

115,Blueghost,"A film with some plot holes, but okay entertainment.",4,17 September 2016,"I'm sure I'll get voted down for this review, but oh well.Here's the reason; as pointed out in the commentary by the late great film critic Roger Ebert, what does anyone need with ""letters of transit"" to get out of Vichy / Nazi occupied Morocco? Just hijack a vehicle of some kind and get the hell out of there. How come nobody thought of that?As I sat through the entire movie many many years ago I kept wondering why Boggie didn't whip out his gun and just force some cabbie to take him and Garbo out of the nation ... south along the African Coast to some sleepy village and wait out the war, or at least long enough to book passage to the states for the both of them. But then again I attended SF State and not USC nor UCLA, so what the heck do I know?But the whole films like that. It's a reflection on a romance gone sour by the fact one of the parties, all those years, had a romantic obligation to someone else. So the whole film boils down to how much bitterness is in the lead character, and does he let that win out over ""the greater good"" to fight fascism. That's pretty much the film in a nut shell.Does it work? Well, again the plot holes arise. If this film had been true to form, then the lead character might have been thrown in the slammer or just shot on the spot without the formality of an arrest. And the woman and her husband detained without question and given to the nazi soldiers. I mean, this is war. Right? But, for some strange reason there's this whole thing about dealing with formalities of getting papers and rekindling old flames for the sake of ""the greater good"". I think a better script would have been a bit more gritty, forgone the whole parading of male egos to impress the female audience, and just let it be the shoot-em-up film that it was probably in its first draft, because otherwise this makes all parties, even the allies, look like complete idiots.I mean, come on, there's an enemy of the state who's trying to escape. You know his name, what he looks like, where he's staying, who his girlfriend is and everything else. You've got some troops there and the Vichy government operates at your blessing. Are you really going to just let that dude and his lady wait it out until he can get some passport saying he can leave? No. You wouldn't.Would you throw your weight around town pretending not to notice them? Probably not. But again the film is engineered for a female sensibility. The female audience largely bought into the notion of needing a stamp of approval from an enemy power to leave. It's complete and total nonsense, but there you have it.I don't get how and why this film was made, nor why it's called a classic, because if you think about it for a couple of seconds, then the whole thing should fall apart on its own premise.Still, I suppose I should add that if you can suspend your disbelief (or even belief) for this thing, and you can buy into the whole plot to begin with, and then really wonder if Bogart's character is going to give a rat's backside about the plight of a couple of wanted people.And, finally, I'm going to get dinged for this too, but the nazi military is not the only set of bad guys we've vanquished throughout our history. They're one of the most notorious, if not the most notorious we've ever come across, but if you look at other films about international conflict, you'll note a high degree of staging put into this film. And I think that should set the intelligent viewer to wondering about this film's merits in the first place.Watch at your own risk.",Casablanca
116,richard-1787,The Great American Movie - historical context,10,11 September 2016,"I don't know how many times I've seen this movie. A lot, because every time it's on TV and I start to watch it, I can't stop. It is, indeed, the great American movie.Other reviewers have offered reasons why it's so great. There's no point in my going over all that.What I thought I would add here is the historical context.Rick makes it clear, in his scene with Sam, that the movie takes place in December, 1941. At that point the U.S. had not yet entered the war, though of course it would on the seventh of that month when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor.By the time the movie was released in November, 1942, however, the U.S. had not only entered the war but invaded North Africa, successfully. Whereas the prefect, Louis Renault (Claude Rains), still acknowledges the Germans in December, 1941, as a good employee of Pétain's far-right dictatorship, by the time the movie opened, at the end of 1942, the French in North Africa were quickly siding with the Allies. Curtiz foreshadows this brilliantly at the end in one of the many famous scenes when Renault, rather than turning Rick in for killing the German Major Strasser, diverts the police and throws a bottle of Vichy water (Vichy was the capital of the Pétainist government) in the trash.American audiences therefore had the advantage of seeing this story with the hindsight of current events, a knowledge that the Renaults of Northern Africa would, indeed, ignore the Germans and side with the Americans.But they also knew that the outcome of the war was still undecided. D-Day, the June, 1944 invasion, was still far in the future. In November, 1942, the Germans would not have looked at all funny to them, but very real and very dangerous.",Casablanca
117,Movie-ManDan,The Most Magical Movie Ever Made.,10,22 December 2014,"Humphrey Bogart is the coolest actor ever. Sure there are actors that are better than him, but none have his spunk that only he can deliver. After first starting off with movies, the world fell for his bad guy gimmick and he changed his birth-date to Christmas to make himself seem nicer (or so I read). His breakout role was in the complex mystery The Maltese Falcon, where he plays cop, Sam Spade, with an edge. Every cop after has just been trying to match Spade in toughness and coolness. Casablanca was the role that really made his versatility grow and made him one of cinema's greatest heroes.During this time, there was roughly a movie a week that was released. All of them blended in together very well and nobody really cared about Casablanca. It was based on a relatively unknown play and the actors treated this as if it was just another movie. Nobody knew this would stand the test of time and become more loved over the years. When Orson Welles made Citizen Kane, he knew it would become the best movie ever. The people in Casablanca could not say the same thing.Casablanca is said to be the greatest film of all time more than any other. The only other movie that's a worthy contender as the best ever is Citizen Kane. The Godfather is also a good rival. But Casablanca is a nicer and more feel-good movie than Citizen Kane and The Godfather,but it has mostly been Citizen Kane and Casablanca that have been rivals since the beginning. Citizen Kane changed the way movies are made with unbeatable camera tricks and the best delivery of a life lesson ever, whereas Casablanca uses just great acting, a great story, and great dialogue. It is about a tough nigh club owner in Casablanca, Morocco named Rick (Bogart) who re-encounters his old flame (Bergman) with her war hero husband (Henreid) laying low. Rick is the only one with letters of transit that can help them escape, and only she can convince him to do it.What makes a movie so good? It has to have good acting, a good script, a good look, great filming, be relatable and emotionally connecting. Casablanca has all of those, minus great filming techniques. What makes Casablanca so special? Awesome swing music a none swing fan would like; great acting by a star-studded ensemble; a wide variety of emotions such as comedy and excitement and drama; unbeatable and quotable dialogue, more than any other in film history; and the amount of love that's in this: he is willing to sacrifice himself for her, she wants to be with Rick, and Rick reawakens his love for her. This is raved as being the most romantic movie ever. There's crappy Zac Efron movies these days that are more romantic than this. But this has the best and most original love story ever.Since Casablanca's release, there have been various copycats and adaptations of it, but none have ever been able to capture its magic. It is the best movie that did not rely on any special effects or filming usages.4/4",Casablanca
118,nycritic,Just Perfect.,10,16 June 2007,"It has to be a crowning achievement for a movie to have entered into public consciousness to such a point that even when the average person may not even have a passing idea as to what this remarkable movie might be about, they assume, from the title, from the poster, that it has to be ""one of those unforgettable love affairs between Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart"". Of course, the more you do know about CASABLANCA the clearer the in-jokes and the subtle yet potent lines become: as a matter of fact, CASABLANCA has now become one of the most quoted pictures of the last one hundred years. With a convoluted story which is really a romantic love affair between Rick, Ilsa, and her husband Victor Lazlo as well as a denouncement of the Nazis in this otherwise relatively safe haven that is Rick's cafe in Casablanca, Morocco, CASABLANCA becomes a ferociously sophisticated tale that has overtones of film-noir and that overwhelming chemistry that both Bogart and Bergman possess, their romance surpassing everything else and being the barometer for which romantic drama has been measured up against. If anything, of the supporting cast, Paul Henreid, for all his third billing, is the more thankless since he doesn't get much to do other than play the somewhat befuddled Lazlo (although he does get to find out that Rick and Ilsa have a little more than common than they'd like to admit). Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre (who also appeared with Bogart in THE MALTESE FALCON), Conrad Veidt also appear here as well as Claude Rains who has one of the most memorable supporting parts as the general who is ""shocked! shocked!"" that any gambling is taking place at Rick's... as he smoothly takes his winnings from an employee. Also featuring one of the most deeply, lush ballads, ""As Time Goes By"" and that powerful scene of defiance as the occupants sing for France, CASABLANCA has become an emblem more than just another feature film -- the stuff that dreams are made of.",Casablanca

You're bad luck to him.""There's not much I can say about Casablanca that hasn't already been said countless times in the sixty-eight years since it was released. The story about a chance meeting of former lovers in French Morocco during World War II is as classic as any movie can possibly be. It's endlessly quoted and nearly universally beloved, and my opinion after seeing it doesn't differ from popular opinion. This is a fantastic movie.If not for Grace Kelly, Ingrid Bergman would be my favorite classic actress of all time. Stunningly beautiful and as talented of an actress as there ever was, she's the heart of this movie to me, even more than the central character, played by Humphery Bogart. Casablanca is my introduction to him, and he gives an expert performance of a brooding, bitter man with a past that's covered his true soul with cynicism. His character was layered and complex, and he delivered the amazing dialogue expertly. Paul Henreid and Claude Rains were also excellent in their roles, with special mention going to Dooley Wilson, who has probably the best role of any black actor that I've seen from that film era.You see old movie trailers describing their respective films with bold proclamations of ""Danger!"", ""Intrigue!"", ""Mystery!"", and ""Romance!"", and those all are perfect descriptors of Casablanca. It just feels like a film that was made to endure across the ages. The music is brilliant, I've already mentioned the acting, the characters are memorable, and the story hooks you with mystery and delivers an ending that couldn't be more perfect.

On top of that, tensions between the Vichy French and French patriots are shown in one pivotal scene, where a group of Nazi officers, led by Strasser, sing a German patriotic song, while Laszlo and the rest of the crowd sing the French national anthem, eventually drowning out the Germans.Casablanca is a classic, with Citizen Kane and The Godfather. Everyone knows that. But if you know me, I usually find classics like these overrated, because I set high expectations for these films before watching the movies that, in the end, I am left disappointed. Casablanca is no different. No, the movie isn't bad by any means. In fact, I think the movie will grow on me after I watch it several times. However, right now, I don't seem to be getting the hype.I liked the performance by Humphrey Bogart, as the unemotional, bitter man. He plays it quite well. Ingrid Bergman plays decently alongside him, both having a good chemistry with each other. The others, including Paul Henreid and Claude Rains, are decent in here too. The score is pretty memorable but what I love most about this film is that each character seems to be well in the end because throughout the film, they all seem to be miserable people that have gone separate ways. These are good people and it's good for us, the audience, to know they aren't angry in the end because they each deserve their happiness.The film is also shot in black and white, even though the use of color was an option for the filmmakers. Sometimes, certain films are better to be told in black and white, while others are better told in color. No doubt, Casablanca works well being in black and white, although there is a colored version out there. The scenes are heightened with the use of shadows and key things being pointed out are the advantages of this filter.Overall, although I may find Casablanca to be overrated, I enjoyed it. I liked the love story and I was really satisfied in the end. If you have yet to see this film, see it. Although it may not be as good as its reputation holds, it's still a pretty great romance/film noir for any movie lovers to enjoy.",Casablanca
121,bkrauser-81-311064,"The Most Accessible ""Greatest Film""",9,23 October 2013,"In preparation to write a review for a film considered one of the best ever made, I read snippets of reviews and glanced though numerous history books looking for that crumb of objectivity that can excuse my love for the Hollywood film named after a Moroccan city. A semblance of greatness that can give even the most flippant a moment of pause and appreciation for the world created by director Michael Curtiz and cinematographer Arthur Edeson; populated by Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.Alas my mind and eyes are not as well trained as the myriad of critics, actors, directors and industry specialists who call Casablanca the end all be all. I can't convince the average film-goer that a black-and-white movie made and 1942 can change your life; even though I wish people would at least sit and watch it through just once.All I can do is explain, in my own words, and through my own experiences why to me, Casablanca comfortably sits on my list of Best Movies ever made as well as any other list goodly enough to feature it.Casablanca means so much too so many generations of people. During its initial run, its popularity was goaded by America's participation in WWII. Rick's changing of values and heart is the same change of character that American's faced i.e. one of isolationist, laissez-faire shruggery to one of sacrifice and honor.The next generation of Americans enjoyed the TV boom which Casablanca was a universally prime choice for consumption. It was made almost entirely in a studio and its fine acting and episodic plot lines made it ideal for TV unlike say the large and majestic Lawrence of Arabia (1962) or the colorful animation of Disney. At one point in the 80's Casablanca was the most syndicated movie on television.I first watched Casablanca on VHS around the age of seven or eight. My mother, always the movie musical buff sat me down around that age to watch Singin' in the Rain (1952), Hello Dolly! (1969) and The Sound of Music (1965). They were all magnificent and all in Technicolor. They were bright, funny and exuberant which is exactly what kids that age should be watching. Then she introduced me to Casablanca; a darker though still syrupy love story set in WWII. It wasn't like going from What Women Want (2000) to Eraserhead (1977) but it was a pretty big jolt for an eight-year-old.Memory around that time is fuzzy but I believe Casablanca was my first full-featured black-and-white movie. I had seen the grittiness of 35mm black-and-white before while watching Frank Capra war shorts spliced with narration and veteran testimonials on the History Channel. Without that exposure Casablanca probably wouldn't have had such an impact; primarily because I'd be without context.Did I like the film at first? Well I didn't dislike it. The memory of the story stuck with me until I saw it again a few years later, then again a few years after that. In fact over the course of my life time I must have seen Casablanca at least ten times; each time building a layer of understanding and subtext.There is universality to Casablanca the shines through no matter who you are or how old you have become. Anyone willing to give it a try will at the very least will be entertained by it, if not moved by it. Surly one of the most accessible films pegged as one of the greats.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",Casablanca

Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, S.Z. Sakall, and John Qualen.This Best Picture Oscar winner actually should have competed with Mrs. Miniver in 1942 since it premiered in New York in November of that year. However, it didn't play in Los Angeles until its general release that January, so it competed in 1943.Michael Curtiz finally won a Best Director Oscar on his fifth try and was never nominated again despite directing many quality films over nineteen more years; the film also won an Oscar for Writing. The great scenes between Bogart and Rains also earned them Best Actor and Supporting Actor nominations. Bogart is Rick, the nightclub owner in the titled town which served as the exit point for those fleeing Europe with the onset of World War II. He used to work as a gun runner but, after a failed love affair in Paris, is now somewhat detached from the world around him. That all changes when his former lover Ilsa (Bergman) arrives with husband (Henreid), who's the leader of the Resistance (Henreid). They need exit Visas, which Rick just happens to be holding for another (Lorre) that killed for them. He struggles with his emotions as he tries to decide whether to help them escape, which would mean outmaneuvering a German Major (Veidt) and the local French police captain (Rains). Greenstreet plays a rival cafe proprietor that wants to hire Rick's piano player (Dooley Wilson), who plays ""As Time Goes By"", which reminds Rick of Ilsa and Paris. Sakall plays a waiter in Rick's employ. The movie's classic ending features unforgettable dialogue!It was added to the National Film Registry in 1989. #1 on AFI's 100 Greatest Love Stories list. #2 on AFI's 100 Greatest Movies list; Bogart's Rick is AFI's #4 hero. #37 on AFI's 100 Most Heart-Pounding Movies list.

Although Rick professes to be neutral in all matters, it is later revealed he ran guns to Ethiopia during its war with Italy and fought on the Loyalist side in the Spanish Civil War.Casablanca is a 1942 American romantic drama film directed by Michael Curtiz and based on Murray Burnett and Joan Alison's unproduced stage play Everybody Comes to Rick's. The film stars Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul Henreid; it also features Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Dooley Wilson.

126,sme_no_densetsu,"""Here's looking at you, kid.""",9,15 January 2013,"What can I say about ""Casablanca"" that hasn't already been said countless times before? The mere fact that a supposedly run-of-the-mill production like this somehow coalesced so exquisitely is nothing short of miraculous. What started out as a simple love story/wartime thriller ended up developing into a sublime blend of cinematic mastery.The actors are a big part of the film's allure. Humphrey Bogart is simply 'the man' and his chemistry with Ingrid Bergman is legendary. They are perhaps the definitive screen couple, which might sound like hyperbole but I'm being completely serious. Meanwhile, the dashing Paul Henreid completes the love triangle and Claude Rains provides exceptional support as Captain Renault. As if that's not enough, the supporting cast also features such distinguished character actors as Peter Lorre & Sydney Greenstreet.However, all of these considerable talents could have easily been wasted on a mediocre script. Thankfully, these actors were working from a crackerjack screenplay that was amazingly still being pieced together while shooting was in progress. Winning an Oscar must have been the furthest thing from anyone's mind. Yet the screenwriters not only won an Oscar for their efforts, they also introduced countless memorable (and enduring) quotes into popular culture.The direction by Michael Curtiz is perhaps the only area of the film that's unexceptional. It's well handled, mind you, but I'd be lying if I said that it's at the same level as the performances, script, music, etc... Speaking of music, Dooley Wilson's rendition of ""As Time Goes By"" is nothing short of iconic and Max Steiner's score references it beautifully.In the end, ""Casablanca"" surely must be considered a serious contender for the title of best American film of all time. Don't let the fact that it's considered one of filmdom's great romances dissuade you from seeing it, though. This is really one of those movies with something for everyone. There's romance, action, comedy and drama, all encapsulated in 102 minutes of cinematic bliss.",Casablanca
127,Howlin Wolf,Of all the films in all the world...,8,14 April 2007,"... this must be the one where the romance of everything appeals to me the most. You have the passionate but doomed re-acquaintance, set against a time when to even look a day into the future was uncertain. Best of all, the guy I'm supposed to relate to from this couple is the boozing, sarcastic incarnation of Humphrey Bogart! Part of me feels like you haven't suffered unless you're someone who's destined for the gutter and bitter at how the world has turned out. An attitude that comes from reading too much pre-18th century poetry, no doubt... (Further insight may also be found in my review of ""The Libertine"".)Anyway, all of the most important details within the story seem to have been collected especially for my benefit, although I guess I'm not the only one, since the film continues to be popular right up to the present day. Truth is, this is a movie for anyone who inwardly looks upon themselves as a cynic with a heart of gold.The question I ask myself though is: Would I be brave and selfless enough to give up my one true love for the sake of humanity in general? I don't think so, although I still cling to memories of a faded love, I have no pretensions of being so noble about it. That is why we have indelible movie-stars and characters, though - Heroes who do the things we wish we could do, and are strong enough to take the consequences of the hardest choices. Rick Blaine and ""Casablanca"" are monuments to the notion of 'doing the decent thing', and it is this quality that makes the script and performances come alive. Watching it should be a magical experience.",Casablanca
128,punishmentpark,A minor classic.,7,17 March 2016,"It's not hard to figure out why 'Casablanca' is such a classic. Its characters, themes, plot development and music will speak to anyone with a heart. But I'd also understand it if some people find it somewhat overrated. Its characters, themes, plot development and music also may feel a little contrived and over the top, especially nowadays. Personally, I'm somewhere in the middle, with a tendency to sympathize more and more as the story progresses.The opening of the film is pretty fast. A lot of things have happened before the main characters are even introduced. That's not really a bad thing. The flashback scenes in Paris are not all too convincing, though, in terms of building up a truly captivating, romantic atmosphere. There's some sweet talk, some cuddling, some kissing, some happy (studio) driving and... then there are the Germans. Again, things go pretty fast, and here it's not really helping.The last half hour of the film is visually much more appealing to me than what preceded it (with more of a film noir feel to it - which must be intentional, to emphasize how Rick gets more and more involved with everything and has a better sense of what is what in more than one way). Also, in the first hour, there are simply too many characters and there is too much talking going on for my taste, I suppose.It's still a thoroughly enjoyable classic, even it is a minor one in my modest little book.

129,dunmore_ego,We'll Always Have Overacting.,6,17 December 2010,"Leonard Maltin calls CASABLANCA ""The best Hollywood movie of all time""; it won the 1943 Best Picture Oscar; voted #2 film of all time by the American Film Institute; Roger Ebert effuses, ""Casablanca is THE movie""; it boasts one of the most regal Hollywood stars in Ingrid Bergman (in the movie that would catapult her to stardom), and the cynical founder of the Holmby Hills Rat Pack, Humphrey Bogart, one of the eras manly sex symbols, even though his face resembled the underside of a running shoe.Some movies were great back then, and stay great: CITIZEN KANE, SEVEN SAMURAI, GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT. Poor CASABLANCA has dated badly - due to censorship at the time not allowing the filmmakers to solidly portray a married woman cheating, censorship on what could be shown on screen to denote ""passionate affair,"" contention over the nihilistic lead character necessarily having a heart of gold, the faults go on. After decades of progress in American film, CASABLANCA, though it has insinuated itself into popular vernacular as a ""great film,"" is nothing more than a talky cardboard romance thriller, with overacting threatening to send us into a melodramatic swoon and enough soft-focus on Ingrid Bergman to make us cross-eyed.During World War II, Rick (Bogart) and Ilsa (Bergman) had a steamy love affair in Paris, which involved lots of kissing with their mouths closed and lots of hugging with their clothes on. Years later, Rick runs a gin joint in Casablanca, The Café Americain, a stopover in Morocco for refugees from Nazi-occupied Europe on their way to America. It's kinda like the Cantina in STAR WARS, except all the aliens are illegal. Peter Lorre cameos as Chewbacca, and Sam the piano player (Dooley Wilson) plays As Time Goes By by flapping his hands up and down on the keys like a seal. ""You badly synched it for her, you can badly synch it for me."" When Ilsa and her activist husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) seek egress through Casablanca to The States, they seek out Rick at his Café (""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks her pointy bra into mine""), knowing he has Letters of Transit that would confuse the Nazi stormtroopers hunting them due to Laszlo causing a great disturbance in the Resistance on Tattooine. ""These aren't the droids you want. Move along."" And Rick and Ilsa reignite their love affair by meeting in dark rooms and talking a lot with their clothes on. Rick's refrain, ""We'll always have Paris"" makes us wonder why he doesn't tear off her pointed bra and make Casablanca the new Paris. Everyone constantly drinking and smoking, yet no one ever gets drunk enough to have a Sexy Party. Censorship, thou frigid mistress.Claude Rains is an unscrupulous, stylish weasel of a frog, a French officer who is nonchalantly AC/DC when it comes to helping either Rick or the Germans - whoever can benefit him the most. Conrad Veidt is Nazi Strasser, bedecked incorrectly in a Luftwaffe uniform.Evidence abounds that CASABLANCA would not make it through today's muster onto the silver screen. Based on the play by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison, Everybody Comes to Rick's, IMDb trivia tells us ""in 1980 this script was sent to readers at a number of major studios and production companies under its original title. Some readers recognized the script but most did not. Many complained that the script was ""not good enough"" to make a decent movie. Others gave such complaints as ""too dated,"" ""too much dialog"" and 'not enough sex."""" According to actress Geraldine Fitzgerald, Bogart and Bergman themselves ""thought the dialogue was ridiculous and the situations were unbelievable...""Yet the movie remains a classic for most film aficionados. Back when they were starstruck kids it was ""the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" Ah, to me, ""the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill o' beans in this crazy world."" I couldn't have melodramatically stated it better, Humphrey.",Casablanca
130,pyrocitor,"Play it again, Sam",10,8 November 2006,"One would be hard pressed to find a list of ""Best films ever made"" without Casablanca included on it - indeed, if any movie was to be singled out as the most laudable and classic picture of all time, there is no doubt that Casablanca would be right up there in the running, if not bestowed the title itself. But don't be scared off by thinking Casablanca has coasted by all these years on its hefty reputation - even now, more than 60 years down the road, this film stands the test of time as one of the most influential, inspiring, quotable and just plain well made creations Hollywood has ever come up with. But one could go on all day listing different adjectives detailing Casablanca's classic status, so I'll try to bite them back and give a bit more of an analysis of the film. Director Michael Curtiz brings the film together with a touch which is daring, yet steady as a rock, presenting a powerful yet entertaining portrait of the days of Nazi occupied France, a message of hope shining through and the tumultuous love affair which grew in the midst of them - in short, the perfect period piece. The cinematography is excellent for the time, sporting a simply beautiful, film noire sheen. The movie's high point (if one could be selected) is its wonderful screenplay, which is without a doubt, one of the single best of all time - both witty, bitingly political, classy, and filled with too many endlessly quoted lines to count. (""Here's looking at you kid"" ""I think this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" and ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she had to walk into mine"" only being the tip of the iceberg) The endlessly referenced ending actually comes as surprising, but fits the tone of unrequited love perfectly, and shows how daring and unique this wonderful movie must have been in its time. Humphrey Bogart is at his stoically iconic best here, creating a touching portrait of an infinitely complex and flawed man with layer upon layer of exquisitely written characterisation (""what's your nationality?"" ""I'm a drunkard"") to peel away. The beautiful Ingrid Bergman also gives a timeless performance as Bogart's mysterious past lover, and Paul Henreid makes a wonderful addition to the most classic love triangle of all time. The movie also manages to include several incredibly entertaining character roles, including the superb Claude Rains as a sympathetic police officer, Sydney Greenstreet as a corrupt club owner, and the deliciously creepy Peter Lorre in a far too brief supporting role. Suffice to say, Casablanca is one of those films one can shamelessly say they have enjoyed time and time and time again - there are far too many subtle nuances to be caught and enjoyed in a single viewing, and the movie has a replay value next to none, making them easy to catch. Casablanca is billed as the most classic love story of all time, yes, but there is ultimately so much more to it than that. Safe to say, the term ""must see"" applies here if you have yet to do so, and if you are among those who have already experienced the classic, there's not the least bit of shame of wanting to play it again, and live the magic one more time. -10/10",Casablanca
131,Cosmoeticadotcom,"Good, not great",6,26 December 2008,"First, let's go with the performances of some of the leading characters, and let me start by stating that most of the characterizations of the acting abilities of the actors in this film, by critics, are often quite wrongheaded. Let us start with the three top billed actors, Humphrey Bogart as club owner Rick Blaine, Ingrid Bergman as his ex-lover Ilsa Lund, and Paul Henreid as Ilsa's husband, the Czechoslovakian Nazi Resistance outlaw, Victor Laszlo. Virtually all critiques of this trio leave Henreid as the odd man out, mainly because the film focuses on the love angle between Rick and Ilsa. But, from a purely technical standpoint, Henreid gives, by far, the best acting performance of the trio (and, it's not even close). Because it is the most restrained and understated, however, it usually gets dismissed as stiff acting, rather than good acting of an intentionally stiff character....one need only look at the cheesy scene in the bar, where Victor hears the Nazis singing their song, Die Wacht Am Rhein, and dares to get the band to play La Marseillaise, then look in Victor's eyes, to see that, far from what critics claim, Victor is a man of great passion and principles from the get go, and this break from his usual restraint gains in power precisely because it is a break, but one that seems wholly natural for a man who has been frustrated for the bulk of his scenes in the film, and then feels he is having his face rubbed in it. While the political implications of the scene have lost their resonance (as do most blatantly political gestures in art), Henreid's volcanically restrained performance in that scene has not. And, as an asides, compare that scene with a similar scene toward the ends of the aforementioned Paths Of Glory, where a captured German girl is put on stage, in front of drunken French soldiers seemingly willing to ravage her, until she starts singing a plaintive German tune of a soldier and his lost love. The drunk soldiers quiet down, and eventually start humming along with the 'enemy,' and slowly show that they have not been totally inured by carnage. A comparison of these two scenes (their structure and placement) neatly and clearly shows why Casablanca is mere entertainment, while Paths Of Glory is great art. Simply stated, without the character (in his physical being and internal composition) of Victor Laszlo, Casablanca does not even reach being a good prose melodrama.Now, contrast Henreid's Victor with Bogart's Rick. Rick is rather one dimensional, despite the film's early evocations of depth. His attraction to Ilsa seems quite superficial; after all, in the flashback scenes in Paris, and even those in Casablanca, does he ever speak of higher purpose? Despite some wittier lines....is Rick Blaine sufficiently different from the Sam Spade Bogart essayed in The Maltese Falcon, or any of the rather stolid thugs he played throughout the 1930s? No. That brings me to the last and least of the trio of star performances: Ingrid Bergman's rather mediocre portrayal of Ilsa Lund. First, it's not a bad performance, but it's nowhere near great. One need only look at contemporaneous performances by a Katherine Hepburn, Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, or even Judy Garland, to see how much Bergman pales in contrast. And, it's rather apparent that Ilsa really loves Victor, not Rick, because anyone who's ever really been in love knows that she would have stayed with Rick, no matter. But the biggest thing that prevents the film from greatness is that it simply plumbs no depths, it simply has no great themes. There is nothing in the film that is so overwhelmingly great, technically or performance-wise, that can put it in a class with many of the other highly praised great films of the past. Seen next to Citizen Kane, Tokyo Story, Seven Samurai, La Dolce Vita, or 2001: A Space Odyssey, Casablanca comes up short, way short. On the plus side, Casablanca is quite a modern film, in terms of pacing (and in some aspects of editing), for within the first ten or twelve minutes, you feel as if you know these archetypal characters (for good or ill), as if you'd already had a full movie's worth of them under your belt, and this is part of the reason why the film sucks you in to its vortex, and gets better, subjectively, as it goes on, even if, objectively, it's a fairly static film, in terms of plotting. Film critic Andrew Sarris claimed that Casablanca was, 'the most decisive exception to the auteur theory,' but he was wrong, and wrong for several reasons. First, auteur theory generally applies toward films or filmmakers that are great, and while Casablanca has been claimed as great, no one has ever made that claim for Curtiz. Secondly, greatness is part and parcel of a vision, and vision is, almost by definition, a property only a singular person can have, not a group; thus Sarris's very admission that Casablanca had more than one 'auteur' makes it also outside the scope of auteur theory, by definition, not an exception to the theory....the film lacks vision, and is a stylistic and narrative hodgepodge. Still, it does entertain, and is an interesting piece of Americana. Also, the lower the expectations you have of the film, the more entertaining it seems. Ah, the flicker of illusion!",Casablanca
132,RNMorton,Hollywood's Greatest,10,7 April 2005,"As Leonard Maltin says, ""everything's right"" in this movie about Vichy-occupied Casablanca in World War II. Bogie is the ambiguously ex-patriot proprietor of Rick's Cafe with Wilson as his loyal sidekick; Rains is the amoral (or is he?) local constabulary; Greenstreet is the owner of a neighboring saloon; Lorre does a stretch as a conniving weasel. Then Bogart's old flame Ingrid blows into town with resistance leader Henreid in tow and everything goes upside down. Almost every line is a gem, whether it bristles (most of them) or is so overdone as to be awesomely camp. The only arguably slow part (and it suffers only in comparison) is the extended Paris flashback. I think this is Bogart's signature performance, a notch or two above his (or pretty much anyone else's) best work. Bergman is breathtaking as his old girlfriend; and all the supporting characters shine in their own way, particularly Rains, who may actually have as many memorable lines as Bogart.

A lot has been made about Bogart and Bergman never talking to each other off screen, but I think that only helped their chemistry. Watch the film again and you can't help but wonder if this isn't the best love story duo ever. Every scene together is so heartwarming and tender it grabs your emotions and doesn't let go.

And isn't it ironic that when the movie was made in 1942, nobody on the set even so much as dreamt that they were making anything special. Certainly they didn't believe their film would go on to become one of the most beloved in cinema history.""Casablanca"" is one of those movies that holds up so well because it has appeal to a broad variety of audience members. The movie's basic plot is a love triangle set in French Morocco in World War II. But it's so much more than that. It's a story about patriotism, about the defiance of Nazism, about the struggle of humankind's search for glory and freedom, it's a satirical and witty drama, its packed with characters so fleshed-out and strong that you couldn't forget them if you wanted to forget them.I think you get the picture.

This is one of those pictures that you can watch over and over again and never become tired of. Even after you know the entire story and have the entire movie practically memorized as I have, it's impossible to become sick of. Even after so many decades of existence, the movie has aged tremendously well and it's just as wonderful and enduring as it was when it was first released.Usually in my reviews I like to describe the power of certain moments of certain films, but I will abstain in this case because I don't want to give away the movie for those who have never had the privilege to see ""Casablanca."" But I will say this. Roger Ebert's definition of a classic is the quintessential way to describe ""Casablanca"" for it's also for me a film I couldn't bear the idea of never seeing again.""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the worldshe walks into mine."" (Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine)",Casablanca

I'd like to have a drink at Rick's Café Americain. The atmosphere and the other actors and the songs are great. I didn't notice that Ilsa pretended to be still in love to get the papers of transit from Rick nor did I expect Rick to sacrifice himself for the sake of his lover saying ""we'll always have Paris"". They flew to Lisbon and Rick proved to be a sentimentalist to captain Renault and a patriot, as well.",Casablanca

Put simply, it deals with timeless themes in a matter-of-fact way, enhanced by the excellent performances, flawless and elegant cinematography and an emotionally stirring soundtrack and score. There's not a single minute wasted, and its impossible not to get caught up in the story of love, longing and triumph over adversity.

The movie pulls you in right away and one can relate to all the scenes and what is behind them. The feel of being in another country comes through as well and that is why we so much like Ricks Café and all that goes on within those walls. Gambling in the back room had to be approved by Rick.

140,classicalsteve,Rick Makes the Heroic Choice: One of the Best Hollywood Films of All Time,10,5 April 2007,"Many a-great film or theatrical play is about a character (or characters) making a monumental choice. The results of that choice may be tragic, such as Oedipus' decision to pursue the mystery of his parentage, MacBeth's resolve to assassinate his sovereign, or even when Gene decides to cause Finneas' accident in ""A Separate Peace"". The choice can also be selfless, heroic, even transcendent. Atticus Finch in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" agrees to defend a black man that prompts ridicule by his white peers. The passengers of the doomed cargo plane in ""The Flight of the Phoenix"" determine not to lay down and die in the desert but rebuild something from the wreckage that could save them. And Rick Blaine, played by Humphrey Bogart in his most memorable role, also makes an heroic choice in the ageless and timeless American film ""Casablanca"". The film is set against the potent backdrop of World War II at a small town in Morrocco, Casablanca, and the majority of the action takes place in a restaurant-bar-casino owned by Rick Blaine. Many different personages of differing background cross the threshold into Rick's: French police, German officers, Nazis, and even members of the French Resistance.Rick at first appears to be a selfish loner. He even says that he ""sticks his neck out for nobody"". At yet there are hints, even at the beginning, that there is something inside of him that has concern for others. The film appears to be about how Rick sets the nobler part of himself free from the cynical veneer that he wears. In the first scenes, Rick rarely smiles. He is quick to lose his temper, doesn't expose his emotions, and appears only interested in the profitability of his restaurant-casino. A scene early on exposes the selfless part of Rick briefly, but he brushes it off and quickly re-dons his cynical persona like a worn overcoat. Victor Laszlo also begins to suspect there is more to Rick when he says that he is ""a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart.""The episode that begins to bring that part of Rick back to himself is a former lover, played with magnetic emotionalism by Ingrid Bergman, who enters Rick's place after a long absence, escorting an important leader of the Resistance against the Nazis. I believe this portrayal may be the best romantic performance by an actress in a leading role I have ever seen. While at once feminine and gentle, Bergman is also highly resolved and dedicated to her cause. She is no wall-flower by any stretch. At first Rick appears tormented by her reappearance and a flashback to their love affair in Paris cut short by German occupation affirms the reasons behind Rick's attitude toward her return. (For a movie made during the war in 1942 to adequately depict how the German regime changed peoples' lives is one of several miracles that permeate throughout Casablanca.)Twists and turns throughout the story do not necessarily foreshadow the final choice that Rick Blaine makes in the end. And we find that Rick was always a hero, and every male in the world aspires to his heroism. This is one of the best reasons why, I think, Casablanca has become not only a classic but a cinematic masterpiece. We all want to make the transcendent choice that may not be best for ourselves, but best for others.",Casablanca
141,hall895,Still a classic as time goes by,8,12 January 2006,"It is easy to see why Casablanca is one of the most beloved films of all time. There's something for everyone...romance, intrigue, suspense and humor. There's a great story here, driven by some truly memorable characters who are brought to life by terrific acting performances. Everyone will remember Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in the lead roles but the performances of a number of actors in smaller roles are brilliant as well and vital to the film's success. A film about a rather unique city and unique situation during a very specific time period, World War II, Casablanca still holds up today as a terrific achievement.In the film, Casablanca, a city in the French Morocco, serves as an exit route for refugees seeking to escape the encroaching Nazis. Freedom is not easy to come by. In a plot contrivance created to drive the story forward two letters of transit, which will allow anyone to leave Casablanca with no questions asked, end up in the hands of Rick Blaine, played by Bogart. Rick owns the café in Casablanca which will be the center of most of the activity in the film. He has carved out a comfortable existence for himself amongst all the chaos the war has created around him. As we meet him, Rick is cynical, jaded, not interested in sticking his neck out for anyone. Bogart brings all of this out with a truly memorable performance. Then Ilsa, as played by Bergman walks into his life. Or shall I say, back into his life, because we shall soon see that Rick and Ilsa are far from being strangers. Here is part of the genius of Casablanca, as by going back in time we learn so much more about the man Rick was and begin to understand why he is the man he has become. Soon, Rick's rather comfortable life will be turned upside down as the film moves toward its truly memorable conclusion.Bogart is undeniably brilliant and his scenes with Bergman are remarkable, filled with passion, intrigue and some of the most memorable dialogue ever put to film. But all the Bogart-Bergman hoopla ignores so much of what makes Casablanca great. As resistance leader Victor Laszlo, the other man in Ilsa's life, Paul Henreid is easily overlooked, perhaps seen as the third wheel. But his character is undeniably vital to the story and Henreid plays it with great conviction and talent. Conrad Veidt as the requisite bad guy, Nazi Major Strasser, gives a fine performance. As Sam, the piano player at Rick's, Dooley Wilson provides some memorable songs you may well find yourself still humming hours after the movie ends. Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, S.K. Sakall...all have small but memorable, well-acted roles. And stealing quite a few scenes is Claude Rains as Captain Renault. Much of the humor in the film comes from Rains' terrific performance.A classic for its time, Casablanca holds up remarkably well today. Some of the dialogue and situations may seem a little hokey by modern standards but that doesn't really detract from the experience at all. Casablanca gives us truly memorable characters, places them into a unique situation and then races towards a fascinating conclusion. One would think that Casablanca will always be remembered fondly, no matter how much time goes by.",Casablanca
142,sharky_55,"The Germans wore grey, you wore blue.",10,27 August 2015,"""I like to think you killed a man. It's the Romantic in me."" muses Captain Renault as he tries to prise open the complex puzzle that is Rick Blaine. Claude Rains' role as the jovial and mild mannered captain of the police is often under-appreciated. He is the arbiter of the political tension in Rick's bar, with his profession of feigned neutrality that eventually becomes genuine empathy, even he succumbing to that same temptation of redemption that Bogart's character goes through. Casablanca is after all a romance, and like Captain Renault, many expected a romance. On the second time around, that ghostly stare of Rick and the nervous smile of Ilsa become laced with much more tension than the first time because our expectations of the film are no longer shackling us from believing of that sunset ending. There's so much to be taken from the two lead's performances. Bogart is enigmatic is his first romantic role outside of his usual typecast. He portrays Rick with a sense of cynicism and disillusionment that speaks for itself; why else would a man remain in Casablanca, on the brink of invasion? We never find out why he has been barred from returning to America, nor do we get that fateful ending of the taking of the city, but we know from Bogart that Rick is man who sticks out his neck for nobody. Opposite him is the radiant Bergman, so often in the right of frame as she considered her left side the better of the two. Her beauty is enhanced by Edeson's used of a softening gauze filter and catch lighting to further add nuance to her character; each wayward glance, each subtle eye catch with Rick is full of humanity and tenderness. Bergman emotes so effortlessly that we can gaze into her gleaming or glistening eyes with ease and see scenes of Paris racing through her mind, and this is even before we witness that famous flashback with Steiner's stirring theme ushering us into a dreamlike memory (on a second viewing of course).Last of the top billing is Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo, the identified hero of the story. It's been often said that he is the weaker link of the acting, that perhaps his character is less substantial within the love story that Rick and Ilsa fleetingly have. But Laszlo is a vital piece of the film and the moral centre that drives the changes in our other characters. In that famous battle of the bands where a rousing round of La Marseillaise brings even the despairing Yvonne to tears, we admire Laszlo for his bravery and defiance but also Rick for his sly nod of approval. Wasn't this a man who only stuck out for himself? Later, in a sub-plot that is nevertheless important and evocative, a woman from Bulgaria approaches him with obvious fear and apprehension. She is desperate to obtain exit visas for her and her husband and even subtly offers sexual favours in return. Rick is unable to disarm her intentions or convince her otherwise, but decides to help her in his own way: ""Have you tried 22 tonight?"" This little gesture not only points to Rick's changing sympathies but also tells us about other characters; see the gleeful reaction of Carl the waiter, or the observation of this act of goodwill by Renault. Casablanca is full of little moments that tell us lots about our characters. Ilsa arrives at night to plead with Rick for the papers that will grant their freedom away from the city. Rick refuses and when he turns back around, it's not an seductive open dress that we might expect from other films, but a gun pointed at his chest. Ilsa is so in denial she cannot afford a moment of weakness towards her former lover, so desperate for those papers. She admires Laszlo for his many deeds, but cannot say I love you in the same vein as the way she says it to Rick. Despite it's troubled writing history, Casablanca has one of the finest scripts in film history. Curtiz's direction is impeccable and fully serves the narrative; there isn't a single shot that doesn't contain visual storytelling. An anguished Rick sits in his dim office, the chiaroscuro lighting illuminating his despair against the dark backdrop as the loyal Sam plays a simple rendition of As Time Goes By, leading into the score swelling as we fade into Paris. The Production Code of Hollywood at the time forbade an ending of Ilsa departing with Rick as it would depict a married woman leaving her husband, an immoral act. And how ironic that ruling turned out to be, because it's the self-sacrifice of Rick which ensures that magnificent ending. Love, after all, does not conquer everything. But we'll always have Paris.",Casablanca
143,Beta_Gallinger,"Decades have gone by, but this one remains a classic!",10,3 August 2007,"I first became aware of this film's existence back when I was around nine years old, but never actually saw it. At the time, I highly doubt that was a great loss for me, as if I did see ""Casablanca"" when I was that young, there probably wouldn't have been many words for me to use to describe what I thought of it, other than ""boring."" However, I finally watched it for the first time about eleven years later, earlier this year, and was very impressed, even though I wouldn't have given it a 10/10 at the time. Since then, for me, it has improved with more viewings! The film is set during World War II in Casablanca, Morocco, where many European refugees, fleeing from the Nazis, had to come in order to have any hope of getting to Lisbon, then to America. Rick Blaine is an American in exile who runs a nightclub in the Moroccan city. He is very cynical and ""sticks his neck out for nobody."" After it is announced that two German couriers have been murdered, Ugarte, the murderer, comes to Rick's club and asks him to hold on to two letters of transit for a while. Shortly afterwards, Ugarte is arrested, so Rick is stuck with these letters. The nightclub owner is then informed that Victor Laszlo, the European Resistance leader, is coming to Casablanca, and Major Strasser of the Gestapo tells him to make sure Victor doesn't escape from the city. Victor comes to Casablanca with Ilsa Lund, Rick's former love who left him in Paris! At first, Rick is not pleased to see Ilsa again. Ilsa and Victor have come for the two letters, but convincing Rick to give them to the couple won't be easy!It has been 65 years since ""Casablanca"" was first shown to the public, and since then, many people from generation after generation have seen it and have been blown away! With its poignancy, suspense, strong dialogue, romance, etc., this 1942 motion picture is a work of genius, and there's nothing surprising about its wide appeal! So, if you want to see a stunning love story, set and made during WWII, and movies don't require a whole ton of action to impress you, I would say ""Casablanca"" is a must-see! If you don't love it right away, maybe you never will, or maybe it will grow on you with a second or third viewing!",Casablanca
144,one9eighty,Play the film again Sam!,10,16 July 2020,"Expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphery Bogart) is living in Casablanca (Morocco), as a night club owner. His place has become a meeting point for refugees who are seeking the right kind of documentation that will help them escape the onset of World War II which is about to kick off. One day a former lover of his, Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), walks into his ""gin joint"" with her husband who happens to be the leader of the underground freedom fighter - Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). While Rick has been surviving above the law for a while the Germans are here now, led by Gestapo Major Heinrich Strasser (Conrad Veidt). With the support of the corrupt local police vichy, Captain Louis Renault (Clause Reins), they aim to get Laszlo. Rick happens to have two letters of transit which could help that he acquired from an acquaintance (Ugarte - Peter Lorre), but Rick is bitter about Ilsa running out on him in Paris in another life, despite the idealistic affair they shared. Why should he stick his neck out again? Ilsa claims to have had good reasons for running out, but Rick is clueless. Could the missing information convince him to help Ilsa escape with her husband?This was one of the first films I watched as a film studies student in the mid 90's for a classical Hollywood module. To the untrained this may come across as a story of unrequited love, but it is much more than that, much more than pianos and happy songs amidst the outbreak of war. This film is strength of character, it's redemption, it's tragedy, it's courage, it's sacrifice, it's optimism, it's much more. It might have elements of love, but it is a transcendence of love, it is loving love, not just two people in love.This film was made in a different era, the Hollywood studio system was in full effect. Writers were churning out scripts on a regular basis, actors were signed to the studios and had contractual commitments to do a bucket load of films. This film was not intended to be a masterpiece, it was just another filler in a line of movies to make sure the studio was producing something rather than letting the competition take audience revenue. Bergman left the film disappointed; Bogart was tired and going through the motions - but it seemed to work, it added feeling and depth to their characters on-screen.The plot to the film is more complex then some of the current Hollywood epics, there are a lot of things going on, even the minor characters that are woven into supporting roles seem to have their own character development and stories going on. From the corrupt Captain Renault who eventually sees they badness in the world; Sam the pianist (Dooley Wilson) who decides he is strong enough not to be 'just' a supporting character; patrons of the club such as Yvonne (Madeleine Lebeau) who finds her strength amidst fellow minded people despite an emotional painful start to the film. The strength of the woven stories in the plot lets you see different things the more you watch this film. As for character development, as I've already eluded to, this is in abundance within the film - nobody is the same person they were at the start of the film when the final curtain comes crashing down and the bombs start to drop. An elegantly written script allowed for the depth to the story and the characters, it is true that a lot of the film is dialogue driven, but it's a smart vehicle that is used to move things forward. This cleverly written script in fact spawned many a quotable line which are in themselves as iconic as the film itself. Most of the scenes are filmed in Rick's nightclub, and despite the film being shot in black and white, the colourful club is popping with vibrancy that transcends the noir colours it was shot in. There is so much life and so many spirits (not just the alcoholic variety) that I can close my eyes, and, in my mind, I can imagine the colours that were there. The musical score that accompanied the film was perfectly fitting and generally helps the pacing of the film, which is not generally slow anyway. At around 100 minutes there is plenty of story to tell and lots of depth to get through. Plenty to enjoy and not enough to make the film drag. Director Michael Curtiz and the writers have created a rich tapestry of a movie which went on to win 3 Oscars amongst various other awards and nominations.As I write this review in 2020 having finally decided to put thoughts and opinions to (virtual) paper this film is now 78 years old. Sure, the film has aged, but it's aged like a fine wine. This is a film I'd happily go back to again and again. Despite the content and the impending world war it presents, this is a beautiful film and touching film with so much goodness, albeit, occasionally wrapped in a bitter shell. There has already been so much written about this film that I don't need to drone on much longer, I'll just wrap up by saying that I highly recommend this film. Yes, I consider this film to be deserving of all the praise it has garnered over the years. A true classic if the word was ever deserving. And, No - the line ""Play it again Sam"" is not said in this film at all - let that sink in, it might win you some bets with friends!10/10",Casablanca

147,gab-14712,One of the...if not the Greatest Films of All Time!,10,25 August 2018,"Famed critic, Roger Ebert once held a mini debate about this 1942 classic, Casablanca. He compared this movie to a similar film, Citizen Kane. He claimed that Kane may be the better movie, but Casablanca is the more popular movie. I agree with Roger because Casablanca is one of the best movies ever made and it seems as if my opinion is a fact (although keep in mind all movies are subjective). There is just so much to admire about the film. The cast, the themes, the actual production of the movie, and the way the film influenced future movies just to name a few. We wouldn't get star-studded romantic epics like 1997's Titanic if this film bombed at the box office or was not even made. Fortunately, this movie was a giant success both financially and critically. It was nominated for ten Academy Awards, winning three of them including Best Picture which it is rightfully deserved. Where to begin gushing about the movie! I loved the themes of the movie. On the surface, this is a story about long-lost love. The movie is not just about love though. It is mainly about redemption. Major characters and minor characters receive their redemption. The one guy who receives his redemption the most and most often considered a hero is the main character, Rick Blaine played masterfully by Humphrey Bogart. Blaine believed he was abandoned by a woman, but she comes back into his life stirring up old feelings as he realized she always loved him. The movie could have taken the easy way out and have the two lovers back together forever, but instead Rick goes for the moral cause of beating the Nazis instead of acting on his feelings. That for me, is what made this movie so emotionally impactful and way ahead of its time. This is an incredibly thematic movie and the themes are always up for interpretation each time. During World War 2, anybody fleeing the scourge of the Nazis to the United States had to travel to Morocco where they needed to pick up exit visas. The place to go is a nightclub owned by Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) who happens to be a very cynical man. Blaine receives an enormous amount of pressure, but his club is still a safe haven for those searching for these exit visas. One day, his former lover Ilsa Kund (Ingrid Bergman) and her French Resistance husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) shows up. The captain of the police, Captain Renault (Claude Rains) informs Rick that he has been ordered by Nazi officer Major Heinrich Strasser (Conrad Veidt) to keep Laszlo in Casablanca. However, Laszlo will do all it takes to escape from the Nazis. One of the appeals to the movie is the A-cast. Bogart, Bergman, and Henreid were all stars at the time. They all happen to be magnificent actors, and each one of these actors might have given their best career performance. Apparently, this is Bogart's first lead role in a romantic film and you would not have known based on his performance. He also plays a cynic very well. Take for instance-one of my favorite scenes of the movie. Rick's nightclub musician, Sam is a mutual friend of both Rick and Ilsa. When Ilsa appears in the club for the first time, he plays ""A Time Goes By."" A song that defined the previous relationship of Rick's and Ilsa's. He angrily storms out of his office....and lays eyes on Ilsa. The acting he displayed there is tremendously powerful. Then we have Ingrid Bergman's strong performance as Ilsa. She tries to convince Rick she still loves him and still wants to be with him despite all the troubles going around in the world. The supporting cast is one of the better ones you will see in a movie of this time period. With the likes of Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre, this is truly an A-picture. I mentioned much about the themes and the acting/characters, but I also really adore the craftsmanship that went into the movie. Michael Curtiz flawlessly directed the movie and got very strong performances from his actors, and the bold script was written by Julius Epstein and Philip Epstein. Their goal was to show us that our main characters lived during an incredibly complex time and well they certainly met their goal. They also created the rich characters of the supporting cast that led to the moral decisions made by our heroes. The black and white cinematography aged very well. I also liked the use of music with the film. Casablanca is a very important film and is one of the greatest films of all time, in my opinion. I was blown away by the film's majesty. The acting, the music, the direction, the themes, the cinematography.....it all screams perfection. What also moves me is that much of the cast and crew were affected by Hitler's scourge of Europe. Many of these people escaped or have family suffering under his regime. I applaud the courage of the cast and crew who made this film that was released during the height of World War 2. If you are searching for a film that is a popular case study for critics and audiences alike or if you want to see a film that reminds you why you love movies, seek out Casablanca.

148,bankofmarquis,A Classic in every sense of the word,10,13 February 2019,"""Of all the gin joints in all the towns, in all the world, she had to walk into mine.""If there was only 1 movie that could be shown to show off ""classic"", old time Hollywood of the 1930's, '40's and early '50s, look no further than Michael Curtiz' 1942 classic CASABLANCA. While well known for the performances of the leads, the multiple quoted lines, Sam singing AS TIME GOES BY and the iconic ending, this film also is a time capsule to a Hollywood of another year - one that just doesn't exist today.Starring the great Humphrey Bogart in an Academy Award nominated performance (inexplicably, losing to Paul Lukas for WATCH ON THE RHINE), CASABLANCA tells the tale of Rick Blaine the owner/operator of ""Rick's Place"" a bar in Casablanca, Morocco in the early days of WWII. He is world-weary, beaten and cynical and is well known as someone who can get things done (for a price) but also one who will not stick his neck out for anyone. When a couple on the run from the Nazi's (Paul Henreid, Ingrid Bergman) enter's Rick's Place, Blaine (for reasons that are revealed in the film) decides to help.""Here's looking at your kid.""Bogart is marvelous as Blaine, you can see every inch of his world-weariness on his well-worn, craggy face. He is perfectly cast as Rick and his mannerisms and vocal patterns depict a heaviness within. Bogart is often criticized for his lack of acting talent - nothing could be further from the truth here. He is perfectly paired with Bergman as Ilse - a former love of Rick's, who is now the wife of Freedom Fighter Victor Laszlo (Henreid). There is real chemistry between Bogart and Bergman in this film and you can tell that they are former lovers that still has a flame burning inside.""We'll always have Paris.""But it's not just the leads who are terrific in this, it's the ""who's who"" of character actors that make up the Supporting Cast that really brings this film to life. From Peter Lorre to Sydney Greenstreet to Conrad Veidt to S.Z. Sakall to Dooley Wilson as Sam (who plays and sings AS TIME GOES BY), all bring interesting faces and characters to Casablanca (and Rick's Place) but the standout is Claude Rains (nominated for Best Supporting Actor - losing, inexplicably, to Charles Coburn in THE MORE THE MERRIER) as Louis, the corrupt Police Captain of Casablanca who becomes an uneasy ally of Rick's. Did I say that Bogart and Bergman had good chemistry? Check out the chemistry between Bogart and Rains, there was talk of a sequel to Casablance featuring these two - I, for one, would love to have seen that buddy flick.Director Michael Curtiz won an Oscar for his work - and it is richly deserved. Nary a shot is wasted on this film, each picture a rich black and white portrait. It is interesting to note that this entire film was shot in California (not Casablanca), mostly on the Warner Brothers lot, but Curtiz was able to give the look and (more importantly) the feel of the place through the sets, costumes, lighting and atmosphere.But it's the words that these characters got to say that really brought home the feel and atmosphere of the time, so credit needs to go to Screenwriters Julius and Phillip Epstein as well as Howard Koch who won Oscars for their work here. This is a masterful, classic work. One that stands up to this day. If you haven't seen this film in awhile, do yourself a favor and check it out - you'll be glad you did.""Louie, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""Letter Grade: A+A rare 10 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Casablanca

Amongst the denizens of Casablanca, there is Rick Blain, proprieter of Rick's Cafe American - a place where one can buy documents needed to escape, as well as escape - through a bottle.Humphrey Bogart is perfectly cast as the jaded, ""I stick my neck out for no one"", Rick. He is cynical, corrupt, selfish...but he also has a heart of gold underneath it all. Bogie plays all of these layers - richly - at once, and was rewarded with an Academy Award nomination. He would lose to Paul Lukas for WATCH ON THE RHINE - a film I haven't seen, so can't judge as to the merits of his win. But...based on Bogart's performance...I'd say he was robbed.Rick's ""partner in crime' is Capt. Louis Renault of the Casablanca police. He is cheerfully and unapologetic-ally played by Claude Rains, who also was nominated (but didn't win) for his performance. These two play off each other brilliantly and the chemistry between these two is evident and I would have LOVED to see another film featuring these two fine performers. I'd say the chemistry between these two actors is a high point in this film, if it weren't for...Ingrid Bergman as Ilse Lund - a past romance of Rick's. When Ilse and her husband, Viktor Laszlo enters Rick's seeking transit papers to flee the Nazi's, the instant spark and chemistry between Bogart and Bergman is palatable. You can feel the heat between the two of them through the screen and the longing and regret for ""what could have been"" is heartbreaking. If you were to show an example of ""screen chemistry"" the scenes between Bogart in Bergman in this film would be ""Exhibit A"".Credit for all of this - and for keeping the plot machinations moving forward - is Warner Brothers ""contract director"" Michael Curtiz - one of the greatest Directors of ""old Hollywood."" His credits include the Errol Flynn ROBIN HOOD, James Cagney's Oscar turn as George M. Cohan in YANKEE DOODLE DANDY, CASABLANCA, the Bing Crosby/Danny Kaye WHITE CHRISTMAS and John Wayne in THE COMMANCHERO'S - all big budget, big expectations films that delivered the goods. Curtiz won the Oscar for his work in this film.Assisting him are the two men who wrote so many memorable lines...twin brothers Julius and Phillip Epstein. They (deservedly) won an Oscar for their screenplay - the only set of Twins to win the Oscar.The supporting cast - including Paul Henreid, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre - are exceptional as well, as are great scene after great scene - including the ""Marseilles"" scene and, of course, the fog covered airport scene at the end.If you haven't seen this film in awhile, do yourself a favor and check it out. If you have NEVER seen it, I envy you the experience of seeing this wonderful black and white film for the first time. It is consistently listed as one of the top 5 films of all time - and earns that ranking. It truly is one of the greatest films - with some of the greatest performances - of all time.Certainly, if you wanted just one example of Studio ""Old Hollywood"" movie making, this would be the one movie to watch.Letter Grade: A+10 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Casablanca

151,Angry_Arguer,Shadow Puppet,5,25 January 2004,"Noir: the word brings movies like this to mind, but where's the depth behind the fuss?  IMDB reviewers have this in the Top 10.  I suspect this has to do with a weepy end.  So much for thinking.If I recall correctly, they tried colorizing this in the 80s and failed entirely because 'Casablanca' exists totally in Black and White.  Others that cannot be duplicated in color include 'Schindler's List', 'THEM!', 'Third Man', and 'King Kong'.  When placed in color, the tone is lost. Speaking as a photographer, I can easily say ""I love B&W"".The lighting here is dynamic, even when Bogie is his bored with himself. Morgan Freeman has borrowed a lot from Bogie.  It's those shadows that make the film more than anything else.  There is competent editing here, but that doesn't help the simple script.  Like 'Rambo', there is 'Casablanca' the movie and 'Casablanca' the phenomenon.  If you don't catch with the latter then you are stuck with the former.

Casablanca is just one of them It's been analysed and assessed possibly more than any other movie, and any person can clearly see why. We have a superbly engrossing movie that is both intriguing and original. There are so many strands to the goings on on what is supposed to be a neutral territory but nobody is convinced. Double dealings and corrupt figures are those who seem to be the ones who survive. Yet amongst it all is our down hearted lead who is superbly played by Humphrey Bogart delivering some of the most iconic lines ever in cinema history. It's not just Bogart, and he is matched by even the most peripheral figure in this film packed with colourful characters reciting some of the best dry humour you'll find anywhere. Much of this film is perfect and you will definitely watch this over again. This is incredibly my first time ever viewing it ever. It won't be my last. Recommended highly.",Casablanca
153,agmoldham,A cliche is appropriate - This is a timeless masterpiece,10,22 December 2003,"Anybody that likes movies must know this story. What really makes this film stand out from so many others is the chemistry between Bogart and Bergman. The ending is classic since Ilsa and Rick are separated even though Ilsa wants to be with Rick rather than war hero Victor. Nowadays, the films ending would probably change and even if it didn't a sequel a couple of years later would see them together. The great thing about Casablanca is that we never know what became of these three.",Casablanca
154,ajs-10,A truly excellent film that lives up to it's billing 'A Classic'!...,10,3 January 2012,"This is a film I've seen many times before but this is the first time I've actually sat down and 'watched' it. I must say I was surprised at just how good it was. Before, there had always been distractions, but today I watched it right through and I must say I was very impressed. It's the kind of film my parents would watch and so it never featured very high on my radar. But when I got into watching films more seriously this was always one of those that had a lot of critical acclaim and so I added it to 'The List'. It finally lands on TV and I had a chance to see it tonight Truly excellent! I will explain what I mean by that after this very brief summary.At the beginning of World War II many people tried to get out of Europe and one of the preferred routes was via Casablanca to Lisbon and then on to America. Consequently there were many refugees stranded in Casablanca falling prey to corrupt officials and other less savoury characters. Bar owner Rick Blaine wants nothing to do with all this business, in fact he doesn't even like people talking politics in his place. But when certain travel documents fall into his possession he finds it hard to remain neutral. Particularly when an ex-lover, Ilsa Lund, appears on the scene with her husband Victor Laszlo. Throw in a corrupt, but charismatic, French Police official, Captain Louis Renault, a German, Major Heinrich Strasser who is bent on arresting Victor Laszlo and, of course, Rick's piano player, Sam, and you've got the makings of a really great film. I won't say any more or the Spoiler Police (Classics Division) will have me in a concentration camp (again).You would have thought a film made in black and white and shot in a 4:3 aspect ratio would be really hard to watch. I'm here to tell you it's one of the easiest films to watch I've seen it quite a while. All the action is concentrated in the middle of the screen; every shot is set up that way. I guess it helps that it is based on a stage play in that respect. Performance wise, well I cannot fault anyone, but I must give special praise to both Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund, both were truly excellent! Honourable mentions must also go to; Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo, Claude Rains as Captain Louis Renault, Conrad Veidt as Major Heinrich Strasser, Sydney Greenstreet as Signor Ferrari and Peter Lorre as Ugarte.I'm not usually all the big on love stories but in this case I will make an exception. I think it's the quality of the performances that really makes this work as well as it does. There is a lot of political intrigue in there too. If you remember that at the time it was being made America had not joined the war in Europe and so what it says politically is pretty important too. But getting away from the politics of the thing, I found this film totally engaging all the way through with characters you could believe in and a great script. I said it at the beginning and I'll say it again Truly excellent and VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My score: 9.7/10.IMDb Score: 8.7/10 (based on 204,219 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 97/100 (based on 59 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

155,jem132,It just gets better with every new viewing!,10,7 March 2008,"It is very apt that my 200th IMDb comment (I review classic films on here) should be for CASABLANCA, a film that is surely the most iconic of the Golden Age of Hollywood. So much has already been written and said about CASABLANCA that to add anything new would seem perfunctory (even this sentence sounds a little trite!), but I'll just add a few points in as to what makes this film so wonderful.-Curtiz's direction. Understated, almost invisible and never intrusive, Mike Curtiz directed what seems like hundreds of Warner Brothers studio films without ever letting personal style intrude upon great story-telling. Curtiz was not a showy director, and CASABLANCA is hardly a showy film. Yet I can hardly think of any director who could have handled the final scene of the picture (the airport sequence) with such a fine sleight of hand. Bravo, Mr Curtiz.-The script, with so many quotable lines. CASABLANCA's script is such a thing of perfection, even more astonishing when one learns that it was re-worked almost daily. Nearly every line (save Bogart's line to Henreid ""It seems that destiny has taken a hand""- it really does feel ""written"")is crisp; the screenplay is a mastery of the art of constructing film dialogue.-It is still such a ""cool"" film. Bogart is perhaps the most ""cool"" of all classic film stars, and CASABLANCA still feels so fresh and modern, despite all the now-classic clichés.-The duelling anthems scene is the highpoint of the picture, even more so than Bogart and Bergman's romantic scenes. It is truly an inspirational film moment, and has enormous power. Just one more reason to see the film.-The supporting cast feel as if they haven't been cast in the film, they simply ""belong"" there. Even bit-characters like Yvonne are so perfectly cast and balanced with the protagonists. Rains is especially superb as Captain Renault, delivering many of the film's best lines.-Of course, the romance between Bogart and Bergman...forever Rick and Ilsa. For lovers of romantic films, CASABLANCA is a doozy (and if you don't like romantic films, there is still much to admire here). I cannot fail to be drawn in by Bergman's ""Kiss me as if it were the last time"" of Bogie's ""Here's looking at you, kid"" every single time.A film treasure.",Casablanca
156,TheNorthernMonkee,There's no way to flaw this movie,10,27 August 2003,"SPOILERS Possibly containedOk, Casablanca can simply be described in six words ""The Greatest Movie Of All Time"". In this film we get to witness Bogart & Bergman in their best performances, in one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) love stories of all time. The way the romance develops, disintegrates, develops again & finishes on a sad note, is one of the best film plots of all time. The acting is superb, the plot is majestic, the film may be in black and white (an idea which is often sadly dated in modern society, but not in this case) but it survives & by the end of this film, possibly the most famous movie scene of all time is shown, climaxing in what can be argued as the greatest line of all time.
I guess the problem with writing reviews is that it's often easy to write vast ammounts about a film you hate, but when it comes to a film you love, you embrace it to such a degree that it's almost impossible to think of anything fresh and original to write.so, with that last statement in mind, let me say this. If you have never seen Casablanca, you must be mad. If you have seen Casablanca and dislike it, you must be even madder. This film is genius, pure, classical genius.",Casablanca
157,charlytully,Holds its own against most Shakespeare plays,10,19 April 2011,"Looking at the list or compilation here on IMDb of notable quotes from the film CASABLANCA, I was reminded of at least 28 sayings that have become part of the American lexicon or our shared cultural literacy in the nearly 7 decades since this movie's release (a time period similar to the one that Abraham Lincoln observed had elapsed between the Declaration of Independence and his own Gettysburg Address). The 30-odd plays attributed to William Shakespeare have some advantages over CASABLANCA in terms of grasping ""market share"" in our collective mentality: namely, they've had six times as long to take root in our imaginative vocabulary, which consequently has yielded far more adaptations (think current release GNOMEO AND JULIET) than time has proffered to the script which earned screen writing Oscars for the Epstein twins. On the other hand, only serious Shakespeare scholars would be able to identify two dozen memorable turns of phrase from the entire body of the bard's work, and many of these professorial types probably would be stumped to repeat ANY bon mot from 10 or 20 of the lesser known plays (all of which necessarily suffer from archaic words or meanings caused by the passage of the centuries). As stated in the quote section here, some CASABLANCA trademarks (""Here's looking at you, kid"") predate the movie, while other famous lines (""Play it again, Sam"") have been ""edited"" for conciseness in the public mind. Back in school, I learned enough about Shakespeare to know the exact same thing applies to most of his famous one-liners: he was primarily popularizing stories and sayings that predated the dramas performed under his brand. (Much of the foregoing also could be applied to biblical scholarship, but I will leave it to the next reviewer to extrapolate between CASABLANCA and comparative religion.)More likely than not, the works of Shakespeare will be much more obscure 100 years from now, while phrases and images from such movies as GONE WITH THE WIND and THE WIZARD OF OZ will be even more iconic then compared with now. But I have no doubt that CASABLANCA will remain right at the top in terms of defining how Americans think, speak, and remember a common lingo.",Casablanca

159,Pedro_H,All-time classic - but more happy accident than design,8,23 April 2003,"Rick escapes war-torn Europe to open a dubious night-club in Africa, but his life is turned upside down by an old flame.So regularly viewed and reviewed, that I'll keep it short for fear of sending you to sleep; but I'd like to make three quick observations.1. Is Bogart (Rick) really in love with Bergman (Ilse)? If so why does he act like he does? Sacrifice means doing something you don't really want to do, but you do it for the general good. He has moved on with his life (he could have returned to the USA after Europe) and maybe doesn't want to turn back the clock? Equally, in the final reel, he merely acts to expedite the moment. This doesn't mean events could not progress later.2. Casablanca has the same smoke (fog, in Africa?) and hardboard sets that Warners used for every production around that time.3. Bogart never indicates who's side he is on until the picture winds down. Through image and viewing film we learn the truth, but that would be no good for a person watching the film for the first time or not being prive to the Bogart image. Surely things should have been at least hinted at earlier?We are among pro's here - and better still pros having acres of luck. Great casting (every one a winner!) and non more so than having the king of cool in the lead.  Also a  lesson in scripting with enough wisecracks to lighten the load, and the wisdom to keep build to a (great) climax(Many ""great"" films are merely great intro's and climaxes. This is what the audience remembers. Just look at Jaws, for example.)This is movie making from a factory, not an art-house. Here you didn't politic for two years before you even start on production, you just got on with it. People involved here made three movies a year and thought nothing of it. This produced a lot of dross, but it produced just as much quality as the more measured and indulgent systems that followed.",Casablanca
160,rebeljenn,"A good film, but not the best.",5,20 October 2005,"'Casablanca' is considered by some to be one of the best films ever made. I personally do not agree that it is the best film ever made. It is certainly a classic with the memorable lines and the dramatic ending and the relationship between the characters, plus good 'photography' and shot composition. Certainly, the soundtrack is brilliant, and it probably is among the top films in soundtrack alone.As a story and a film overall, my personal opinion is that this film is over-rated. Perhaps in the time it was made, it was among the best films. I think the majority of people would find the film tedious to sit through nowadays. (So, if you're in for a lot of action, you probably will not like the film at all. However, if you're looking for a good story about times past or just want to see what all of the hype is about, I don't think you'll be too disappointed. Hey, you may even think it is the best film ever made.)",Casablanca
161,tonypeacock-1,"Watch it again, Sam. Beloved wartime drama.",10,10 October 2020,"Produced by Warner Bros studio in the middle of World War Two when the very outcome of the conflict was far from a foregone conclusion. Nazi Germany could have prevailed.It didn't stop the studio releasing a film with a very anti-Nazi screenplay set amongst the backdrop of the port of Casablanca, Morocco a country in the forties under French and Spanish protectorates.The film is a romantic drama film starring Humphrey Bogart as nightclub owner Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as his former love Ilsa Lund from the days when he lived in Paris, France.The film explores the past relationship in France, prior to Nazi occupation and the shock breaking of the relationship.Ilsa appears to have moved on, so much so that she is married to a Czech resistance fighter Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid).Casablanca itself is home to refugees seeking safe refuge to Lisbon, Portugal and on to the safety of the United States.
As it transpires Blaine may hold some letters of transit that allow a freedom of travel through Nazi occupied Europe.
It is the triangle of Rick's love of Ilsa and the key to freedom he holds that are the bedrock of the story.A film that delivers so many classic lines that often been quoted in other television and film productions.Made at a time of wartime austerity with a screenplay that probably scared off some other studios the film rightly went onto success, ultimately at the Academy Awards.The film does have a lullaby throughout played by cafe/nightclub houseband pianoman Sam (Dooley Wilson). 'As Time Goes By.'Also watch out for the scene in the cafe when a Nazi singalong is drowned out by the locals singing 'La Marseillaise.'",Casablanca
162,RonellSowes,We'll always have Casablanca,10,27 November 2020,"If you examine most lists of the greatest films of all time you'll find Casablanca near the top usually accompanied by The Godfather and Citizen Kane. Rightfully so, I can't think of any better and it's hard to believe two of them were released just a year apart of one another,Kane in 1941 and in 1942 Casablanca.In many ways Casablanca is the no-name masterpiece. The majority of slightly cinema conscious people have seen or at least heard of Casablanca yet only true film enthusiasts know who directed or wrote it-despite it winning the Oscar in both categories. Unlike say Francis Ford Coppola or Orson Welles,Michael Curtiz is never fully recognized for his achievement;perhaps because the film doesn't have the artisticness of the other two. But an unnoticed director is a deft director.
However,what excels most in Casablanca is the script-only three were listed for the Academy Award but roughly six or seven deserve some credit.
The story is borderline legendary because it is inspiring,poignant and pragmatic. The characters are equally exceptional and fascinating each with a different personality and ideas and none without flaws,except perhaps for Victor Laszlo. While all others around him have at some point submitted to their circumstances and feel regret,Laszlo doesn't. For the entire duration he remains as an immovable,paragon of resistance and strength-resembling more of something than someone. That's not to say all characters must be flawed and change,take Elsa for instance. She doesn't have any emotional or mental barrier to break like Rick but still she doesn't constantly live under one note the way Laszlo does. She has her own conflict,torn between both men and forced to choose a side and maybe at times even behaves in a lamentable fashion. Laszlo,however, never falters from his single direction and is never forced to react or change anything. He is not just static he's flat. On quite the contrary is Rick Blaine.
He's the reluctant anti-hero to end all others. At first he's a patriot or a 'sentimentalist' energized to fight for his beliefs then after he's devastated by Elsa leaving him,he becomes a self centered cynic. But with Elsa's return into his life,he must decide whether he'll become the Rick of past or the Rick of present. Bogart's performance is one of the best ever in his own natural style, fueled by the finest dialogue written for film. Witty,amusing and piercing Casablanca's dialouge is unsurpassed (if I listed my favorite lines I'd probably write half the script.)
Even the minorest characters have there moments in the film (though for many of them its based on what they do rather than say) but the best are unquestionably from Rick. The only other with close to as many quips as Mr Blaine is Louis. He too has many great lines and moments in the film,such as when he tells Rick that he is shocked there is gambling going on before being handed his own winnings by a policeman. Louis is unabashedly a man devoid of scruples...or so he seems. Though he acts as if he simply serves himself,like Rick,he is at heart a sentimentalist and believer just like the latter.Casablanca is nearly perfect in every way, the reason why it is such an endearing classic that remains popular seventy-eight years after its release.Because of films like it, I can overlook the innumerable amount of terrible movies in constant production knowing that we'll always Casablanca.",Casablanca
163,elvircorhodzic,You Must Remember This!,10,13 June 2016,"CASABLANCA is a movie about love and virtue, heart and mind.As time passes this movie gained the name of one of the biggest Hollywood movies of all time. Overall, I wonder what's so special. Average war drama characteristic of that period on the one hand and the perfection of the relationship of film segments from the other side. When all gather and take away, I find myself thinking that the Casablanca is damn good movie. Heartbreaking, great war drama thanks to its spirit of moderation and memorable roles. Great film about humanity and cynicism in the war-torn North Africa. The average movie, but probably remarkable human story. Here and there, there is a certain lack of logic and a lack of cohesion, but the action is smooth, clear and fast so it's almost impossible to notice. The plot, or the outcome at the end of the film is simply magical. It's risky, sad or politically unacceptable. So many tears and emotion, and yet the end is relaxing happy. I think the film would be even better if he had not had to deal with censorship. Music and cinematography are really impressive.Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine is bitter, cynical American expatriate. Features are there for a reason. Compassion, romance and sentimentality come with a story The focus is on Bogart's character, but that does not diminish the fact that it is a great performance.Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund at its best and the strongest role. She is the mistress and faithful wife at the same time. Her appearance in the film is captivating. Tearful eyes while she accepts the voice of reason and at the same time resisting his heart is impossible to forget. The chemistry between the main actors is incredible. Although the stage lights shining Bogart and Bergman, a whole range of supporting characters is simply extraordinary, and among them leading Claude Rains in the role of the charming, corrupt French captain.Casablanca is a great blend of melodrama, intrigue and humor. The scenario is naturally repaired, but not bad. Uncertainty, acting and dialogue are unforgettable. Personally, the most important that this film in no case can be linked to a particular war propaganda.",Casablanca
164,oneloveall,Splashes of timelessness,6,14 February 2008,"A movie that failed to live up to it's historic praise for several reasons.Mainly, the chemistry between these two just does not feel as heart-tugging as one would expect. Actually it feels a little creepy at times, in a father/daughter sort of way.Bogart of course remains the picture-perfect image of an old Hollywood, jaded leading man, but ultimately feels like a subtle caricature as the one-liner's role on.The final scene, after hearing so much about it, left me wanting more, and not in a love-lingers-painfully kind of way either.Despite these imperfections, Casablanca still has numerous moments where you do see cinematic time stopping and the historical relevance of the work starting to make sense. It is simply a matter of differentiating what the public has made legendary and what actually works even today.",Casablanca

Epstein, Phillip G. Epstein, Howard Koch.""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship""..""We'll always have Paris""......Director Michael Curtiz's Casablanca, released in 1942 as World War II raged in Europe, has enjoyed the reputation of the quintessential classic American movie for more than 60 years. It was Curtiz' crowning achievement, despite having made several successful films for Warner Bros. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman attained Hollywood immortality in their roles as American ex-lovers who cross paths in Casablanca, Morocco, North Africa during Nazi-occupied Europe. Rick Blaine (Bogart) is an American ex-patriate who owns a jazz nightclub/cafe frequented by many, including thieves, prostitutes, singers, and of course Nazis and Resistance good guys. One such Resistance activist is Victor Laszlo (Paul Henried) who just happens to be married to Elsa (Ingrid Bergman), Rick's former lover. Their romance was played out in Paris, presumably before the war, but she opted to marry someone else for financial stability. When Rick and Elsa reunite, their old flame is rekindled. Much has been said of how terrific the chemistry between Bogart and Bergman is in this film, and they represent a kind of film noir pair which means despite burning hot for one another, they cannot be together as one of them has to answer to a greater good. In this case, Rick must give up Elsa and allow her to remain married to Victor. The ending, made famous through the lines ""Here's looking at you, kid"" finds Elsa leaving with her husband to safety in America, as they are fleeing the Nazis who wish to capture them. Character-actor Petter Lorre was popular at this time and despite being a bit of a ""foreign guy"" stereotype, seems to fit into the cynical, darkly humorous world of Casablanca, which remain not just a love story, but a film noir sample. Warner Bros and Michael Curtiz were strictly old Hollywood studio system but while some films were forgettable during this time, Casablanca is a prime example of the system's success. Great script lifted from a play (Everyone Comes To Rick's), irony, cynicism, humor, comedy, romance- all in the dialogue. Some action including chases and gun fire. The cinematography by Arthur Edeson is typical of film noir - mostly night scenes- but the scenes of Casablanca marketplaces and cafes is exquisite. The prolific film composer Max Steiner, beloved by Hollywood and especially Warner Bros, provides a beautiful score, filled with American themes such as jazz and patriotic songs and French music such as the anthem Marseilles. Claude Rains, in an early film role, plays the stuck-up and somewhat sinister French Captain Renault, who harbors both dislike and envy for Rick. Costumes are by another Hollywood costume designer now forgotten Orry Kelly and provides a look at fashions in the early 40's/WWII Era. This film is worthy of being studied and scrutinized for how to make a great film.",Casablanca
166,silverscreen888,A Stirring and Splendidly-Made Wartime Film; Very Well-Acted,7,22 June 2005,"Julius Epstein, one of the writers of ""Casablanca's"" screenplay, has called his script bad names. On philosophical grounds, I must agree with some of his honest objections. However, the production values and general storyline are so beautifully done in this famous cinematic work of art that the film's sterling qualities easily outweigh its relatively minor defects. Of course, the film is somewhat overrated by most moviegoers; but, its scenes and human relationships rank with some of the finest achievements in Hollywood's history. And the acting is far above average, every last line of it. It is to this presentational aspect--and to the characters' motives within the film that perhaps viewers have always responded unusually favorably. The film was set in occupied North Africa during wartime. Between the Vichy French government and the Nazi occupiers, the criminal element and those desperate enough to be driven to commit crimes, the city was a deceptively-calm-appearing and yet a very-dangerous place to be living in those years. And, incidentally, it provided a fine milieu in which to set a dramatic film whose theme is how men ought to face their responsibilities in emergencies. The only way to escape from Casblanca's oasis of deceptive peacefulness was to have ""papers""--legal permission to persuade the authorities to permit such a departure. In fact, the storyline begins with visitors having such papers stolen, by a desperate man who is later killed. The remainder of the plot line can be summed up in two sentences. In the city, an expatriate named Rick runs a large nightspot to whom sooner or later, because he is neutral and accommodating, everybody comes. Enter Ilse, and Viktor Laszlo, she the woman who inexplicably left him in Paris and the man she left him to go back to, a man wanted by the Nazis everywhere as their chief opponent... What happens after this is the outcome of the sorts of people Rick, Ilse and Viktor are, and an enigmatic French police captain beautifully played by Claude Rains. As Rick, Humphrey Bogart is at his best, investing a neutral and too-much-unaccounted-for obvious ex-racketeer with intelligence, a sense of honor and melancholia for his lost love. Ingrid Bergman has little to do but look beautiful and say she is sorry, but she does both wonderfully, as always. Paul Henried as Laszlo is straightforward and capable Others in the very fine cast include Syndey Greenstreet as a rival nightclub owner, S.Z. Sakall the bartender, Leonid Kinskey a larcenous employee, Joy Page as a desperate refugee, Peter Lorre as the unfortunate thief, Dooley Wilson as Rick's segundo and piano player, and able Conrad Veidt as the Nazis' chief. Michael Curtiz's bravura direction controls the film's pace and draws very good performances from his cast. Every element of the film glows with intelligence; the lighting is extraordinary, and the costumes, sets, art direction by Carl Weyl, and Arthur Edeson's cinematography are textbook-class work. Mention should be made of Max Steiner's music and the song ""As Times G By"", first heard in this feature. Scenes such as the entry of Ilse into Rick's, the roulette wheel payoff, the rival singing of the Marseillaise to drown out the Nazis' song, the killing of the thief, the closing of Rick's and the justly-famous climax at the airport in the fog need no elaboration by me. What is questionable is the ending, in which Rick gives up Ilse, at least for now, because Viktor Laszlo needs her; the stronger ending would have been for Laszlo to give her up to Rick and say, ""Do you think so little of me as to imagine I'd let you do a 'sacrifice'? I need only my liberty, as every man does. I have my work--it's enough for me for now. Happiness such as yours and the freedom to enjoy it again is what I'm fighting for. What we're all fighting for! So, we go on together or not at all."" But this flaw is less important than the careful build in tension achieved within the film, less vital than the gradual awakening of righteous anger in men who had stayed out of the battle between brutality and justice too long already. The film has a great deal to say about what men should do in the face of evil; and much of the time, it says it very well indeed.",Casablanca
167,gigan-92,"""It seems destiny has taken a hand.""",10,1 February 2012,"This film is a monumental piece of film history. I can honestly it might just be one of the best movies of all time. If anything, you have to acknowledge the writing. Almost every single line of dialogue in the film is a household terminology to this day, most people paying tribute to the film without even knowing it. That's why I wanted to use a less popular quote for the title, and it has its own meanings within the film. Another joy of the film is composer Max Steiner; yes, Max Steiner of 1933's ""King Kong"". His music is timeless, and he captures the mystery and romance of the film perfectly.It's definitely a love story at a glance, one of the best ever told if not so, but I view it more as a story of sacrifice, on the part of both lovers. The film is also a piece of history, taking place during the Second World War It entails a time when the Third Reich's immense shadow was cast over all of Europe, and the film portrays this quite nicely. However the film is about more than Charlie Chaplin poking fun at the Nazi Party (gotta love Chaplin). There is quite a bit of nicely done comedy within the weaving of it all, but it's balanced just right.I'm not sure if it qualifies as a film noir exactly, but Rick (Humphrey Bogart) is cynical enough to fit the bill and the use of shadows is quite extraordinary. The setting and lighting during the best scenes of the movie are darkened rooms, making it all the more intense. As I said before, Rick, with his sarcasm and pessimism, is one of my favorite characters of all time. To me the movie is about him most of all. He sees the events taking place before him, knows he must act, but for a while chooses not to. The beauty of it all is that we know why and we feel for him.All the performances are incredible. Like all golden era Hollywood flicks of the 50s, it draws our attention without the use of bloodshed and sexuality. Although don't be mistaken, it is indeed used here and very subtly I add. Its takes a film lover's eyes and ears to catch it, and the story telling is just marvelous.One cannot be a true fan of cinema without having seen ""Casablanca"".",Casablanca
168,griffolyon12,"A timeless classic, that is one of the finest films of all-time!",10,19 June 2008,"Casablanca is one of those rare films that truly qualifies as a perfect film. There is absolutely nothing bad about this film, this is a timeless classic that is still as relevant to today's society as it was back in 1942. Many of the themes in Casablanca can still be seen in action in today's world, but what truly makes Casablanca transcend generations is the love story. The love triangle between Rick, Ilsa, and Laszlo is one of the finest triangles in movie history; as much as you want to hate Laszlo so Rick and Ilsa will get together, Laszlo is just such a likable character you can't hate him, and you just know deep down Rick will not take Ilsa away from Laszlo. Of course what truly keeps this film from being a monotonous three-way love story, is the colorful cast of characters surrounding the three leads, in particular the scene stealing Captain Renault played brilliantly by Claude Rains. Of course what has always made me love this film isn't the brilliant characters or the love story, it is in fact the screenplay. The screenplay is one of the finest ever crafted in the history of film, each scene flows perfectly, never feeling too long or too short; as well the film features some of the finest dialogue ever spoken in a movie, there are just so many quotable lines from this movie. Overall Casablanca is just truly a masterpiece, and if you have never seen it I suggest you do because it is one of the greatest films ever made.I give Casablanca a flawless 10 out of 10!",Casablanca

If it ever feels clichéd (and it does), there's a big chance this movie started that cliché.It can feel dated, but there's still a lot of power to it.

170,rajdoctor,Casablanca,8,28 July 2007,"Here is looking at you kid, these words are written by my current boss Bernhard Drumel in his skype. I never knew that they are from Casablanca, until I saw the movie.This is a love story during the world war second based in Casablanca, Morocco, North West Africa  a port where refugee Europeans came to depart for USA. Old time lovers - Rick (Humphrey Bogart) and Lisa (Ingrid Bergman), meet after many years in Casablanca and remember their love in France. Lisa was and is wife of Victor (Paul Henreid) and the couple is planning to run away to America through Casablanca. Rick - now the owner of the most popular club in Casablanca is well connected among corrupt military and government machinery - sacrifices his love and helps the couple duo to go to America.It is the not the story in itself, but the way it is told that makes it a very interesting viewing. The pace is fast and engrossing. The story slowly unfolds and never lets the viewers guess the next till the very end. There is a sense of mystery and suspense. The backbone of the movie is a love story that has gone wrong. It connects with every audience. The misery and cynicism of Rick is so real that every man may feel a close resemblance to the feeling Rick is having. Though many, there are well itched characters that define the intent and purpose of their words and actions. The characters  mostly representing different European countries  and give an universal appeal to western audiences, and so I understand its relevance in people's mind and popularity.The character of Rick is brilliantly played by the chain smoking king Bogart. This was my first movie of Bogart and he impressed me the most. Like all olden days actors who  each one of them  had their unique style and so delight to watch; Bogart has his own. Ingrid looks and acts beautifully to say and hide her secrets with her eyes and body language. Paul Henreid was good, but not brilliant. Special mention of the local French Captain Renault, played by Claude Rains  who plays the most engrossing characters with black and white, shrewd and sober shades  a delight to watch him.Each and every dialogue of the movie is perfect and catchy. The lines are worth repeating even today and written with so conviction that they are ever-green. The one that I personally liked the most was when the German commander asks Rick which nationality he belongs to; and Rick with his usual cynicism replies  I am a drunkard. There are so many such quotable lines almost unforgettable in the movie.This was Director Martin Curtiz's 132 movie production as director. It took him almost 20 years of making movie to come out with this gem. Martin kept on making movies till the last year 1961; he died in 1962. Great music, fantastic choreography of people, and definite acting by most crew! The only thing I disliked about the movie was that most of it was shot indoors on the sets, and that in itself did not give the movie the epic proportions that normally one would expect from such classics.There are many hate reviews about this movie, and I read a few of them. I found this movie to be very good  made in 1942, it was much ahead of its time in terms of scripting, dialogue, pace and screenplay. Now a days we see so many movies  but to think of the rave Casablanca would have created during world war second times, would have been enormous.My salute to Martin Curtiz and Humphrey Bogart! Now I know and understand what does my boss mean when he writes and says  Here is looking at you kid! (Stars 8 out of 10)",Casablanca
171,WriterDave,"I'd Like to Think You Killed a Man, It's the Romantic in Me",10,16 August 2003,"It's that kind of cynicism that makes this old-time classic endearing to a modern day audience.  ""Casablanca"" is a noirish melodrama set against the back-drop of WWII and Europeans fleeing to America by way of French Morocco. What's so refreshing about it, in spite of its classical love triangle theatrics, is that is never places romantic love on a pedestal.  It realizes that in a world of uncertainty where neutrality is the biggest crime, there are more noble things than love.  This movie is sited by many critics and viewers alike as one of the top three greatest films ever made.  It's easy to see why.  It contains probably the greatest dialogue ever written for the screen. It stars two screen icons in their greatest roles and a superb supporting cast.  It's directed by Curtiz with a complete lack of pretension.  There's nothing overtly artistic about it, or any sign that anybody involved was trying too hard. Essentially this was a gathering of classy professionals who set out to accomplish one thing: make an entertaining film.  In the process, they might have made the greatest.  Unlike so many of the other classics of this period, you never have to view it ""in context"" to appreciate and enjoy it. Rock solid entertainment anchored by smart writing cleverly cast and competently directed translates well in any day and age.  Play it again, Sam, and it gets even better As Time Goes By.",Casablanca
172,dr_foreman,Claude reigns,10,19 March 2004,"Ah, Casablanca...everyone's second favorite movie!  On the recent DVD commentary, Ebert remarks that he's never heard a bad review of this film. I think he's asking for it there, because I've certainly heard some negative comments in my time, but usually these criticisms come from the sort of people who have a seizure the moment they're forced to watch something in black-and-white.  So, we can disregard their opinions then!  Every movie lover seems to like Casablanca, and that kind of almost limitless appeal is certainly remarkable.I consider this movie a triumph in the name of good screenwriting.  The directing and production values are certainly fine, for their time, but it's the great LINES that everyone remembers; yet Hollywood still rarely acknowledges the key role that writers play in movie-making, preferring instead to pump up the myth that directors are the sole creative forces that drive production (I'm not denying directors' importance here - merely arguing that it is perhaps exaggerated, as this movie's classic status indicates).My favorite thing about Casablanca?  Strangely, it's Claude Raines, who is simply so funny and seedy that he sticks in my mind every time I watch it. I love him, but because he's such a sleaze, I feel uncomfortable for it; in many ways, he's the most morally ambiguous part of the movie!  Of course, Bogey rules too, and the supporting cast contains two of the greatest character actors...well, ever.  Greenstreet and Lorre (or, as I prefer to call them, the Fat Man and the Bug) have more personality than most of today's ""stars"" combined, and they're just two of the many highlights here.",Casablanca
173,caa821,It's simply ---- GREAT,10,26 August 2006,"This movie can only be described as GREAT - and it gets even better with the passage of time and the more you see it. The tone of the story, and the presentation of the legendary Bogart persona, and his most famous characterization, Rick, the American ex-patriot owner of the famous Casablanca night club, is completely exemplified in two early scenes. The essence of ""cool"" and ""authoritative,"" Rick is in the private area of his establishment. Sitting alone at a chess board, he nods to his large guardian (in Mideastern attire and fez) at the entry door as to whether persons seeking entry are to be permitted or not. One man, tall and pompous, a key official (perhaps the head) of Deutsche Bank, gets a ""no"" nod from Rick. As he protests, Rick joins the guard at the door, and indicates the man must limit his patronage to the bar. As the man, protesting still, hands Rick his card, Rick rips it and tosses the pieces aside. The arrogant big-shot shouts, ""What!? Do you know who I am!?"" Rick,/Bogie replies with his unique look and tone, ""I do; you're lucky the bar's open to you!!""Next, Peter Lorre, as the smarmy, little, shady character, Ugarte, sits down at Rick's table. He has the ""Letters of Transit"" which he later gives to Rick for keeping, and which comprise a key element to this story. But before this, conversing, he says to Rick, in his quiet nasal voice, ""You despise me, don't you?"" To which Bogie replies, ""Oh, if I gave you any thought, I probably would.""It would be worth watching the entire film if only those two brief exchanges were all there was to enjoy. But they are only a preliminary to a picture and story which have offered everything one could desire, but even more as time passes. The drama, the depiction of the mood of the time and feeling of WW II, and sensational performances from the four principals - Bogart, Bergman, Rains and Henreid - and Lorre, Greenstreet, Wilson, Veidt, and the remainder of the supporting cast, all provide one of the most entertaining couple of hours you can find, regardless of medium or period presented.Regarding this turbulent time during the maturation of WW II in Europe and northern Africa - as an historical, nostalgic representation of that part of our history, and this film's representation of the best of Hollywood's craft during that era - it provides us more to appreciate today than it did when produced, or when it may have been viewed during years past, and closer to the time period of the story.If someone were to place a gun to my head and demand a criticism of any aspect of this film, the only thing I could cite would be the thought that Henreid's Victor character show perhaps a bit more energy and charisma. Henreid was one of Hollywood's most suave, virile, ""continental"" characters, and the man who was already noted for his lighting two cigarettes simultaneously, for Bette Davis and him in ""Now Voyager."" In ""Casablanca"" we are given to assume that the fate of the free world may hinge on his patriotic, underground leadership, and that the Nazis must fear his abilities more than Eisenhower's or Montgomery's. Granted he would have been low-key in not wanting to stir-up the authorities while seeking to leave - but Paul seemed to ""lower the key"" a bit more than he might have in his performance. However, this is minor, and in no way diminishes this film's greatness.",Casablanca
174,policy134,Bogart's distinctive character in practically every scene,9,1 October 2005,"The film that made Bogart a major star is not what I expected the first time i saw it. After seeing him in the Maltese Falcon which I thought was a brilliant film I decided to give this a try, although I am not really into romantic films as this certainly is. The love story is truly one of the more memorable ones but it would have been contrived without the war time setting. Everything the characters do may have long lasting effects on their lives or in some cases may even claim their lives. The Rick character, who is supposed to be completely neutral, can't escape being an accomplice in what the Laszlo character is deeply involved in. It's not only because he loves Ilsa (Bergman) but you can see that he hates the Germans as much as anybody when he first meets Major Strasser. That aside the Bogart character would never send a decent man to his doom as Laszlo essentially is, even though he is a rather cold hearted bore.The film could have done without the Renault character, who is simply there to make commentary about Bogart's character. Will he or will he not sacrifice Laszlo or his lady love? The comic relief is minor and I suspect that even people who love the film will find anything novel in Rains' appearance.Then finally there is Bergman. Except for being beautiful she must have had some other qualities as well and that is extremely underused in this film. To see her crying every five minutes is not what you would expect a modern woman character to do and indeed her character is simply a hanger-on and besides being the object of affection for both Rick and Laszlo she is supposed to stay in her place.The whole film can be described as being more entertainment than of actual historical importance and on that level it delivers but it is still funny to think that it was being made at a time when the whole world could have been crushed by the forces of evil and that this could have very well been the last time you would ever see a movie that criticised Nazism.",Casablanca
175,braddugg,"To begin with a review for what is considered a great movie of all time by many, I would say, ""Play it again, Sam"". The line is in the movie itself.",6,20 September 2014,"To begin with a review for what is considered a great movie of all time by many, I would say, ""Play it again, Sam"". The line is in the movie itself.This movie is revered by many and indeed comes out as a great love story, but in fact apart from few minutes of a montage or a flashback, it never really revealed how they did fall in love, they here is the hero and the heroine. The protagonist, is apparently not a human here but they are the transit papers that drive the whole story and to get hold of them will be each character's will. Played extremely well by all the characters involved, the acting is a text book for many aspiring actors even today and shall be there forever. Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund just paints the screen with her eyes, so well captured those eyes are that they made me desire for them and to have a faint touch of those to wipe those tears. This movie shall always be a tribute to her. Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine has done well and what I learnt from him was how to be expressionless and to derive an expressionless face also needs an extremely tough expression.The writing is pretty accurate but the reasoning's are minimal, why a certain character behaves in a way is not completely revealed in the film. It is highly unconventional a love story for 1942 coz, Ilsa is seen kissing Rick many a time as he is the one she loves but is not by Victor Laszlo, the man whom she is married to and the man who loves Ilsa the most. That is an irony and brings an uncertainty to the way characters act. One scene where Ilsa and Rick are in Paris, embracing each other breaks up where they have to part and another scene turns up that Ilsa is manipulating Rick later to escape the country and even then she says that she loves Rick only. That is an inconsistency I observed but nevertheless, the story she reveals to Rick as to whom she was and what has actually happened to her makes up for it. But for today's viewers most scenes may seem like to have been cooked up and not so fluid and even I felt the same, the climax escape which Rick sets up is a bit truly altruistic and actually not very much appreciated by me. If I love a woman, she comes back I would rather stick with her then let her go again. My love is of prime importance to me but here, Rick has other plans so I did not like the climax much had it been the other way portraying a selfish human being as protagonist, surely the movie may not have received this much appreciation.The music is excellent and the one song As Time Goes By is poignant and relevant to the movie narrative and even for normal reference. That is a high point apart from the acting of the film. The cinematography was simple and so are the settings which are mostly shot within studio.So thus, I would say, this movie accounts as a great one by many and is loved by many more and I would love Ingrid play the role again and again too. But writing should have been tight and the characters should have been driven by selfishness rather than selflessness.My Rating 3/5.

While I will agree that it is a high quality piece of film I can't understand how it can rank that high. The movie is well acted, well directed, and the screenplay contains the more memorable quotes than any movie ever. That is an indicator of either of two things. Either the writing is the greatest ever or people just really cling to the old romance and intrigue story. I like Bogie's character. What a classic screen drunkard. Try watching this movie and keeping up with the drinking bogie does in it, you'll be face down in an ocean of your own vomit before the twelve minute mark. He is cold to the world and looks at things in a super rational way. Sam shoulda got his own movie. He could have been the 40's version of the Dolemite. Because the rest of the characters seem befuddled next to Bogie it gives the feel of watching a one man show. The story doesn't stand out that much, it's pretty standard Romance material.

The first half of the film is pretty annoying, endeavouring to set the tone of a plot that struggles to really initiate its development. The pace accelerates in the second half, reviving the interest, but the dramatic progression remains quite difficult, and the movie overall doesn't turn out to be convincing enough despite well written dialogues. Moreover, it falls sometimes a bit too easily into melodramatiscim, with for instance a much too grandiloquent soundtrack that tires quickly.Anyway, for sure Casablanca was a pioneer in its time, but like a lot of other old classics, critics seem to favour too much this aspect compared to the intrinsic quality of the movie, which would explain why it is so highly regarded.",Casablanca

It brings together all the elements of entertainment and transcends them into a work of art.  Story, direction, music, theme, acting, dialogue; all are operating at perfection here.  If studios were regularly turning out movies like these today, the movie industry wouldn't be in any trouble.

182,MelbaMan1,Movie Never Loses Tension,10,2 April 2018,"A classic. Terrific actors, without exception (I wished Peter Lorre's part were longer). Great production. Incredible direction (look out for the head profile shots at the end, at the airport - that still remains striking). Unsurpassed screenplay. I could have taken a star off though because plot developments are glossed over too quickly. Bogart holds it all together and was never better. Movie captures the tension, desperation, romance and sacrifice of wartime magnificently. Only other criticism is over-use of music to manipulate viewer's response. Too noticeable. 
SPOILER ALERT. As examples of rushed developments: Rick's change of conviction and Ilsa's acceptance of Rick's decision that he is staying and she has to leave with Laszlo. Hard to believe she would be comfortable leaving it up to Rick to tell her husband she was leaving him. And her decision not to meet him at the train station in Paris (after she learns Laszlo is still alive) because she thought Rick wouldn't leave Paris without her - well, to be kind to her I guess she believed that Rick would get over her in time and didn't need to know she was married (I realise Laszlo wanted to keep their marriage a secret to protect her but I think in the circumstances Rick could have been told). Because the movie never loses tension any of its shortfalls are masterfully hidden. It all passes in a whirl and the movie is over before you know it!
Trivia: Hitler is never mentioned. Only a portrait in Strasser's office. 
An interesting approach to the film is to look at it as Rick's ultimate revenge on Ilsa for deserting him in Paris. He really deserts her at the end. She has no choice but to go with Laszlo. Rick could have got a letter of transit from Ferrari at the Blue Parrott. Ferrari had offered one to Laszlo and Ilsa but they had turned it down because they wanted to leave together. It seems incredible looking back that Ilsa was willing to leave her husband behind in Casablanca to fly off to Lisbon with Rick. It was really only Rick who forced her hand to leave with her husband.",Casablanca
183,bsinc,What is it about this movie??????,6,15 November 2002,"I found ""Casablanca"" to be pretty unentertaining, funny at moments(sometimes unintentionally), but not worthy of being called a movie classic. Hell no! It's just another movie where Bogart is trying to look like he's to cool for school, and Bergman isn't anything special either. The best moments come from Claude Rains as Captain Louis Renault and the best acting is played out by Paul Henreid. However, the story's what really sucks here. If that's really how people used to live half a century ago, then thank god for the 60's and the 70's. And if I'm is supposed to believe that in real life the love triangle would unfold as it does on the big screen or that Bergman just goes along with Bogart's last minute decision that she's in love with Victor Lazslo after all, leaving Bogie, the love of her life behind, well, then I'm offended. If that young couple just needed money to buy their way out of Casablanca, then why the hell didn't Bogart do the same. He was loaded. We're supposed to believe his character's background of being so terribly in love, experiencing a loss of that love, an over acted performance of going through pain when he rediscovers that love, yet in the final scene he doesn't show any sign of true heart break or any kind of pain. He decides he's going to cling to the past and let the love of his life, the only woman he ever loved and will ever love fly away forever. Pretty cheesy.

The only person you can trust is yourself. The only way out is through bribes and lies. This just a typical scenario for Casablanca.In Nazi oppressed Casablanca, everyday could be your last. Your life isn't safe as long as you have enough money. For Rick Blaine, Casablanca is as far away from home and his past that he can get. Troubled by a lost love, Rick has become the owner of a night club. With the help of his friend Captain Renault, his business of drinking, entertainment, and illegal gambling make Rick's the place to be. His life long friend and piano player Sam is with him until the end. What seems like a decent existence in the desert is about to be thrown into a whirlwind of trouble.One evening at Rick's, a distinguished guest arrives. It is the leader of the underground Resistance, Victor Laszlo. He and his companion arrive shortly after one of Laszlo's comrades, Ugarte, is captured and killed. Rick has no intention of helping Laszlo and his underground movement until he meets his wife Ilsa. When their eyes meet, it is as if a freight train has ran right through Rick. The one thing he has been hiding from has found him. The woman that left him alone on that platform in Paris after the Nazi invasion is back.His only solution is to start drinking, but drowning his sorrows solves nothing. After the first night, Rick must make a decision. Does he give up Laszlo to the authorities or aid him in escaping the Nazis? Rather than halting all illegal activities that make Rick's the place to be, it is business as usual. Giving Laszlo the information he needs would help win the war. It would also mean giving up the only woman he would die for. Now the weight of the war rests on Rick's shoulders, as well as his heart.This is not just a love story, Casablanca has everything. It has action, comedy, thrills, as well as romance. The background is the second world war, but the story could have taken place earlier, later, or even today. The Epstein brother's winning screenplay cannot be compared to anything of its generation or future generations for that matter. The flow of conversation goes back and forth like it would in real life Casablanca. Witty remarks, memorable lines, and dialogue that would be considered ""cliche"" today are ""cliche"" because films of this archetype copy Casablanca in so many ways.Where would Casablanca be without its cast? The film, although virtually flawless, is illuminated by its fantastic actors. Humphrey Bogart, with his charisma and overwhelmingly powerful screen presence, stars as Rick, the lost soul. His lover Ilsa, portrayed lovely by Ingrid Bergman, doesn't know what is right anymore. Claude Rains as Captain Renault tries to make a living off of the illegal activities at Rick's. Ilsa's husband Lazslo, Paul Henried, is ever defiant of the Nazi oppression, after surviving one of their concentration camps. His cause is stronger than ever. Thorwn together, this ensemble, accompanied by some nice appearances by Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, and Conrad Veidt, cultivate a story that is fueled by desires and overflowing with energy.Casablanca has been captivating audiences around the world for decades. It can only be assumed that director Michael Curtiz and his team of writers figured out how to make a film. All the pieces fit to get this picture churning. From the opening frame to those last lines by Bogart ensure that this will not be the last time you see Casablanca. The film will only keep growing stronger through the years.

I'm sorry about that. I had a vague idea that it's some kind of drama and that was correct. But I also expected something more fluffy and romantic like ""singing in the rain"" or something like that. There is romance too but the overall setting with war and nazis was more heavy and serious than I expected.So... is it good? Well, maybe not my top favorite but I also can't call it a bad film. It's a little bit too talkative for my taste. I get somehow exhausted when all the movie is just talking and not much else happens. In my favorite kind of dramas there also is something else, like...boxing, driving a car, quiet moments with instrumental music. There was some music here too but it was only in couple of scenes where a character sings or plays the piano. There was also some instrumental background music that was so quiet that at first I didn't notice it at all. Only towards the end I came up with an idea to put the volume really loud to notice there actually is some music. I'm such a music freak that I think I would have been blown a way by this movie has there been more emphasis on emotional music giving a backdrop for the beautiful images.Then we get to what was good. The visuals. Very stylish shot scenes with brilliant lighting, and the acting is good. My favorite was Ingrid Bergman. She's amazingly beautiful and her acting is so lively that I have rarely seen such radiance. Where have ladies like this disappeared from the movies? Are they extinct from the planet altogether?Humphrey Bogart is perhaps the most legendary name here. Even if you haven't seen his films you probably know he's the guy with the hat. Once in a hat store I tried on a hat and the saleswoman said that is the Bogart style hat. He doesn't wear that iconic hat of his very much in this movie but when he finally does he becomes a very cool guy.Ok, this is my random review of Casablanca. I wasn't blown away but it's one of those movies that seems better and better the more I think about it. Usually movies start to feel worse when writing a review and I start to think did I overrate them. But I'd estimate this one is one of those ""grower"" type cases where an appetite to watch it again will appear soomer or later. Check it out.",Casablanca
186,lagudafuad,Everyone should watch this movie,9,12 November 2012,"Here is a movie that has always found a way to remain in the top of the lists when it comes to the best movies ever done.Casablanca crosses the genre of drama and romance, the acting was top notch and the movie's screenplays were so well done, that you will be torn in two for Lily. Humphrey Bogart (Rick) was the perfect prince charming, and also a hero in all ways including love.Done in 1942 Casablanca is based on an unproduced play named ""Everybody Comes to Rick's"" by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison.The movies ending is one that I love and is something you can skip back to watch again, the dramatic scene, which showed sacrifice, love and suspense. The twist at the end is something the producers would have slipped in to catch the audience off guard, something I enjoyed.Casablanca's lines (""Here is looking at you kid"" and ""This Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"") have remained on the lips of many and it has fondly been repeated in more movies than I can bet the producers would have even dreamt.So what is this great movie about? Casablanca's plot is set during the early years of World War 2, In Casablanca (Morocco) the is a man named Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) who owns the most popular handout spot in Casablanca, he had everything under control and he even had influence on the police. Everything was fine till the past came knocking.Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) an old lover of Rick shows up at Rick's nightclub and sparks were sent flying in both ways, as they lost contact (Ilsa's fault) without any explanations.Ilsa is not alone, with her is her husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henereid) who is a renowned fugitive Czech Resistance leader.The couple needs letters to escape to America, letters only Rick can give. So Rick is in a dilemma to help the woman he loves escape with her husband or keep her in Casablanca.Nominated for eight (8) Academy Awards, Casablanca went home with 3, Best Picture, Best director and Best writing screenplay, Casablanca is a commercial success and has a strong cult following, which has disturbed any plans for a sequel and also the colorization of the movie.The movie cinematography was done by the cinematographer of the movie Frankenstein (1931), who made sure that any time we get to see Bergman her eyes sparkled.Here is a movie, AFI has ranked the 3rd greatest of all time in their AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition). I advise you get a taste of Casablanca, an iconic movie that sets the trend of what a true romantic movie should be about.www.lagsreviews.com",Casablanca
187,majikstl,"""The fundamental things apply ....""",8,9 May 2007,"CASABLANCA is one strange little movie. It takes place in French Morocco and is populated with characters and actors from all over war-torn Europe, yet it is quintessentially American. It is rich in humor, but it isn't a comedy. It is a war movie, but its one great battle sequence is the singing of rival national anthems. It is plotted like a soap opera -- indeed, it is essentially a ""woman's picture"" -- but is directed like a spy movie. It is a film filled with intrigue, but offers only a vague sense of danger -- mostly it is about people standing around talking. Considered one of the most romantic movies of all times, there is little romance and only fleeting moments of passion. Romance and heroism are defined not by what the characters do, but what they don't do. It is about sacrifice, doing without now in the hopes that it will benefit the greater good. The great triumph at the end finds two lovers parting ways, probably never to see each other again. And, yet, that is the happy ending as nobility conquers cynicism. Long before I actually saw CASABLANCA, I had already seen bits and pieces, read about it in reviews and film history books, and even owned the screenplay. It was parodied in one of my favorite films, Woody Allen's PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM. Its famed dialogue had long since become beloved cliché. So, when I finally saw the film, it was anticlimactic; I knew the story, the dialogue and even the ending -- watching it was like watching a rerun, nothing seemed fresh. I was vaguely disappointed. But over the years I've viewed it again and again, and liked it a bit more each time. I'm still not ready to concede that it is one of the great films, yet it succeeds at being something more; any failings it has as drama are inconsequential compared to its status as a cultural icon. It transcends being a mere movie and is as much of the American pop psyche as ""Yankee Doodle Dandy,"" ""Tom Sawyer,"" Norman Rockwell's paintings, Graceland and the '57 Chevy. America would be just a little less great without it.Basically, the film is a standard love triangle: Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) finds herself torn between the dark, mysterious Rick (Humphrey Bogart) and the pure and noble Victor (Paul Henried). Yet, Ilsa isn't the film's central character nor is the film from her perspective; Rick, the ""other man,"" ultimately controls everybody's destiny. In a broader sense, Ilsa is the world at large, torn between Victor and his resistance to Nazi aggression and Rick, an American defiantly striving to remain, if not neutral, at least isolated from the encroaching war. Rick's decision to ""stick his neck out"" is America's decision to enter the war. It is said that while filmming, no one knew just how it would end; in reality it couldn't end any other way and still be true to the American spirit. One thing that repeated viewings reveal is just how well the film is acted. It has a notable cast of character actors from the era -- Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, etc. -- and the inimitable Claude Rains practically steals the film as Captain Renault, the cheerfully pragmatic ""poor corrupt official."" For Bogart, it was the pivotal role of his career, bridging his persona from tough guy roles to a more heroic image as a leading man. His Rick is an enigmatic character, who he plays with cynical restraint and the occasional flash of sly wit. Bergman's role is remarkably small, yet she plays Ilsa with cool intensity that borders on cunning. She shows Ilsa to be a woman who is use to being quiet, almost subservient, as a means of camouflage. Bergman does most of her acting with her eyes, studying other characters and reading their motives. And she is absolutely gorgeous throughout. But perhaps the film remains so beloved, not because of the romance or its nationalism; but because it is quite funny. Humor in a film can be a sign that the material isn't being taken seriously, but when it is done this well, the opposite is true. Here wit defines the characters and reveals not just their attitudes, but their intelligence. A film that so easily could have fallen into the trap of easy patriotic platitudes instead uses humor to define cynicism and enhance conflict. More than just one-liners, the crisp dialogue defines the characters as intelligent and complicated individuals.Though CASABLANCA remains a beloved film, I wonder just how much of that reverence is based on nostalgia; so much of what the film represents is passe, or at least politically incorrect. A submissive woman who begs a man to think for her would be declared an insult in our post-feminist society. Few believe in the nobility of war any more, regardless of the circumstances; and fewer still see the value of self-sacrifice. Maybe that is the secret of CASABLANCA: it isn't about who we are or who we once were, but about who we would really like to be.",Casablanca

189,michaelarmer,Here's Looking At You Kid,9,16 January 2020,"What can you say that hasn't been said before.There are a few films that have a lot of sycophants that talk rubbish about so called top films when they are nothing of the sort, this is not one of those films.I am not a fan of Romantic Drama's but this is not a run of the mill film, this is Casablanca, probably the best Romantic Drama ever.Humphrey Bogart is excellent, as is Ingrid Bergman and the rest are good as well, Conrad Veidt was good as the nasty German, it was directed well and excellent dialogue, photography is poor though, but that is the nature of the times and type of film, music is spot on.It is not perfect though, the dialogue is a bit too sharp early in the film and there are several scenes where people order drinks and leave either before receiving them or after only 1 sip, so that was a bit forced, but it relaxed a bit later on, like as if the characters were getting used to each other, but the slow build works up to an excellent ending, the photography is a bit dark and it would have been nice if Peter Lorre stayed in the film a little longer, I think they could have lengthened the movie to 2hrs from the 1hr 45mins it is, and it would have been better.Nevertheless it is still a great film, worth the plaudits and its place in movie history.Bogart did say ""Here's Looking at You Kid"" a few times, and the "".....not worth a hill of beans...."" sentence, but never said ""Play it again Sam"", however he did say ""Play it Sam, You played it for her so you can play it for me""Sam you can play this again and again.",Casablanca

It had been so many years since I'd seen it; all this time later I found Bogard a little inert. But Bergman really is extraordinary in this, isn't she?

191,dead47548,Simply amazing.,10,8 January 2008,"Possibly the most iconic picture in cinematic history. It's a film that doesn't rely on subtext and deep symbolism in order to impress the audience. This one is all about the story, and it's a magnificent one at that. Another picture that focuses on the lives of people who are indirectly involved in the war and how it changes them. Rick and Ilsa are two of the most complex and beautiful characters ever brought to film, in my opinion. Their romance is beautiful and the effect that leaving one another has on them is utterly tragic. Watching Rick brood while throwing back shot after shot the night after his first encounter with Ilsa in years is one of the most brutal and well acted scenes I've ever witnessed. He pours his heart and soul into the performance, as does Bergman, and everything about watching them is just sensational. You just know that you're watching magic. Their final moments together are some of the most shattering I've ever seen. It truly ripped my heart into a thousand pieces. Bergman delivers one of the greatest female performances I've ever seen, and Bogart is simply phenomenal as well.",Casablanca
192,EthanBJones_03,Highly Recommended,10,21 October 2017,"​'CASABLANCA' - 1942Directed by Michael CurtizStarring Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Paul HenreidPlot Overview: ​Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), who owns a nightclub in Casablanca, discovers his old flame Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) is in town with her husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). Laszlo is a famed rebel, and with Germans on his tail, Ilsa knows Rick can help them get out of the country.I know, I know. It's quite frankly atrocious that it has took me so long to see this film. I say that because Casablanca is a masterpiece of epic proportions. I genuinely don't think I could name a flaw with this gem of a movie. It is a masterpiece and well and truly deserves its spot on the Film Hall of Fame. If you haven't seen it, then I highly suggest you do.So what do I like about it? The story was fascinating and interesting and intriguing in all senses of the world. And don't even get me started on that ending. That ending, which I of course won't spoil, is easily one of the greatest endings in cinema history. It is a testament to the magic a GOOD writer can make.Humphrey Bogart was exceptional as Rick Blaine. I absolutely adore this performance and the character is also truly amazing. Words cannot describe the authenticity and skill that Bogart projects onto Blaine. It is a performance that deserves A LOT more recognition by the average movie goer.Ingrid Bergman was, also, excellent as Ilsa. She didn't quite outdo Bogart in her performance but I would be lying if I didn't say she came pretty close. She manages to project so much emotion and trauma onto the audience in such a fascinating and spectacular manner. As far as the supporting cast goes, they were also exceptional. Paul Henreid was excellent as Victor Laszlo and added a very interesting and intriguing character to the already riveting narrative. Claude Rains was excellent as Captain Renault and provided an excellent humorous backbone for the movie. He wasn't necessarily essential to the plot but he was essential to the tone and final product. Dooley Wilson was also excellent in his unfortunately short run as Sam. Truly amazing performances from each and every single member of the stellar cast.For 1942, this movie is a technical wizard. The cinematography and editing were both incredible. The lighting is visually stunning and worked exceptionally well in the black&white environment. The music and sound effects were also excellent and the visual effects were truly admirable, especially considering the time at which they were created.As a whole, 'Casablanca' is a masterpiece of a film and I can HIGHLY recommend it. As for flaws, I can not name a single one. It is a work of art and should be commemorated for its massive contribution to film and the art form. Please, if you have not, see this film; I assure you that it is worth your time. I'll rate 'Casablanca' 10 'Half a Thoughts' out 10!",Casablanca
193,roghache,"Romantic wartime classic, but not my favorite",7,17 March 2006,"Yes, it is classy and a classic but personally, though I adore World War II movies, Casablanca is simply not my favorite. I love both the stars, the unique and immortal Humphrey Bogart, also the perennially wonderful and sympathetic Ingrid Bergman. And they have tremendous chemistry together here. That's the problem, there's just not enough of the love story and too much indecipherable wartime intrigue that I could never really quite fathom.The plot revolves around a cynical, enigmatic American expatriate, Rick Blaine (Bogart) who runs a nightclub in Nazi occupied Casablanca. An old love, Ilsa (Bergman) arrives there with her husband, Victor Laszlo (leader of the European Resistance). Rick holds some bitterness toward Ilsa as she ran out on him years earlier in Paris. Meanwhile, there is assorted intrigue regarding some vital letters of transit that Rick has in his possession. He has the chance to turn his love's husband, Laszlo, over to the SS and be free to leave Casablanca with Ilsa. The question is...will he?As I mentioned, the intrigue befuddled (and bored) me. For me, this old black and white wartime classic is all about three things, the amazing song ""As Time Goes By"", the memorable and famous closing scene (which I won't give away) and the following...Much of the interaction between the characters occurs at Rick's nightclub, the Cafe Americain (the setting around which the film sort of revolves). There is one unforgettable scene there in which some drunken Nazi soldiers are singing the German national anthem. Resistance leader Laszlo orders the playing of the forbidden Marseillaise, the band starts up (with Rick's permission), Laszlo bursts into the French anthem, and the other club patrons gradually chime in, drowning out the Germans. It's fabulous! You can't help but cheer.It's a famous old classic which I really should watch again. Maybe now that I'm older (and smarter?), I can ferret out all that intrigue!",Casablanca

196,Marc_Israel_365,a top selection for altruistic reasons,9,3 June 2012,"Let's not rehash the old accolades of Bogie & Bergman which still ring true. I watch this over and over because it represents a type of commitment and honor that I believe we all wish we were capable of. The dialog is full of the utmost courtesy, while the humor can bob and weave into the script that still manages to pull the romance through the end. The side characters are very strong, if not stereotypically played out, but ultimately memorable, none the less. Of all the quotes that echo, it is Ricks' heartbreak and bitterness wrapped up in his replying if he remembered Ilsa, ""The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.""

Men and woman are constantly coming through here, looking for a ticket to America.  Police Captain Renault (Claude Rains) occasionally helps them out, but for a price - or the company of a beautiful woman.  One night Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) arrives at Rick's saloon, but what surprises Rick is the woman whom Laszlo bring along.  The woman is Ilsa Bund (Ingrid Bergman), Laszlo's wife and Blaine's former flame.  Ilsa's sudden appearance sends Blaine's new, well structured life into a swirl towards oblivion.Every actor plays their part perfectly.  Bogart delivers a cool and clever performance as Blaine, with memorable lines like ""I stick my neck out for nobody"" he creates one of the most memorable and likable movie characters of all time.  Rains delivers a fun (and hilarious) performance too as the corrupt police captain.  He flirts and makes illegal deals, all the while keeping his smug grin and witty charm.I wouldn't call ""Casablanca"" the best movie ever made, but it certainly is the best (and most realistic) love story that's ever been put on screen.

As Romance is a tad bland, and as a Political movie it's a bit dull. If it wasn't because of Claude Rains (as Captain Louis Renault), it would have fallen flat for me. I could elaborate, but it is completely subjective. Still, I can certainly see why, with the interesting structure and progress from a 40s script, it would be so memorable even with today's standards. And I did enjoy the relayed experience and information of a situation from so long ago. The lightning during the entire movie is probably the single best thing about it, specially for a black and white movie. The pacing is also impressive, which makes it watchable still today.It did entertain for the allotted time, but I'll soon forget it, I must admit (probably unwillingly).

The movie starts with Rick Blaine, portrayed brilliantly by Bogart, who owns a night club called ""Rick's Cafe American"", during December 1941 in the city of Casablanca. Set years after a devastating separation between he and a long-lost loved one, that particular woman, portrayed beautifully by Ingrid Bergman, who shined on screen, returns with a new husband who is on the run for the law, but she also faces serious love connections with a heartbroken Rick. Beautifully directed by Michael Curtiz, and written brilliantly by three or four separate screenwriters, ""Casablanca"" is one of the greatest movies ever made. This movie has more relative humor, strong heart, and memorable characters than the technological success of ""Citizen Kane"". These characters like Rick, Ilsa, Victor, Cpt. Louis, and Sam, are still memorable and lovable to this day. Also, there are so many memorable lines that can be spoken a thousand times, like my two favorites: ""Here's looking at you, kid!"" and ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"", both quoted beautifully by Humphrey Bogart.

When it was made - late 41 early 42 (it was released in late nov 42) - World War two was by no means decided so this film also serves as a morale booster as the seemingly uncaring Bogie for love of a woman finds a conscience and helps win the freedom of a country.

203,coldwaterpdh,Not bad.,7,17 April 2008,"I have to say ""Casablanca"" is a bit overrated. While displaying technical genius on many levels, the film has not aged too well. Maybe it blends in with other films of the era. It was entertaining, but I'd say pales in comparison to other classics from the golden age like ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre,"" and ""The Maltese Falcon."" Unlike those two, ""Casablanca"" fails to deliver any deep message. There is no moral and there is nothing terribly memorable about the film. Well actually, there is Bogart...Without him, I think ""Casablanca"" would have been pretty dull and forgettable. It just didn't grab the way I hoped it would.This all being said, the story is fun, the humor is ripe, and the acting is superb. Technically speaking, a nine. Entertainment-wise, I'd say a six.

205,TheHonestCritic,"A cinematic masterpiece? Or, just another overrated movie? Check out my review below!",4,12 September 2021,"""Casablanca"" (1942), oh man, I'm probably going to get a lot of anger for this review. But, as you all know, I'm honest with my opinions and I will always be honest. All right, I'll just tell you right off the bat, I'm not a big fan of love stories or romance films. So, as you can imagine, I wasn't that enthused about watching this movie. Now, I didn't watch it voluntarily, I watched it in one of my film school classes in college. Much to my surprise, it's better than I thought it would be. Sure it has problems, but there are some good things as well. Overall, it's just a mixed bag for me. ""Casablanca"" has a predictable and cliched storyline, dated special effects and a generic soundtrack. The plot is, an American expatriate named Rick Blaine is stuck in a dilemma. He's forced to choose between his love for a woman, or helping her and her husband escape from the currently Vichy-controlled Casablanca, so he can continue with his fight against the Germans. At first glance, this story does sound interesting, as dilemmas are a strong factor in the genre of drama or romance films. Unfortunately, half of the story works, and the other half doesn't. Here's a fun fact for you: the movie was shot in the chronological order of the story, which is a rare thing in film. The first half of the script was complete before production began, but the other half wasn't. Ironically, the already completed half before filming is where the movie drags. The second half of ""Casablanca"" is a lot better and stronger for me, both with plot and acting. Another problem, is that this movie doesn't really have a villain in it. I suppose that some will argue that the closest thing to an antagonist is the Germans. The problem with that, is that the primary antagonist here is way too vague and they don't really stand out. All films need to have strong protagonist(s) and antagonist(s) in them, that's the basics of writing. Granted, there are movies with little to no villains that are executed better. Had ""Casablanca"" included a real villain, it might've allowed more room for extra potential. As I said, there are good things thrown in the mix throughout this film. For example, it has not one, not two, not three, but six fantastic lines in it! How about that? My top three favorites are: ""of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine."" My second favorite is: ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" My top favorite of the six is: ""here's looking at you, kid."" All six quotes are fantastic! But, those three lines in particular really stand out, in my opinion. If only the writing was as good as those lines, this movie could've been a huge masterpiece! The ending is one of the best parts of the film, if not the best part. That scene where Rick Blaine and Ilsa Lund say goodbye to each other at the airport. No one's going to argue that's not an iconic scene. Had the movie been as strong as it's second half, the storyline would've been perfect. Granted, in some cases, it's not how you start, it's how you finish. That being said, in the world of cinema, you need a strong opening, a strong ending and a strong centerpiece in the middle to tie it together in the end. A film has to work as a whole, not in parts, otherwise it will not mesh together. The special effects are good, especially for it's time. However, there are some once in a while that are just dated and a bit cheesy. Now, let's get to the positive elements of this movie. As for the acting, it ranges from top-notch to just average. One unique thing about the cast, is that it's heavily international, which I think is great. Fun fact: there are only three American actors among the whole cast; Humphrey Bogart, Dooley Wilson, and Joy Page. The rest of the actors and actresses are all foreign. Most of the acting is average, but some of it is exceptional. The biggest standout performances come from Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Claude Rains. Even though a lot of the acting was average for the most part, I still give it a pass, thanks to the three standouts I've listed. All of the sets/locations are beautiful and they give the film a stunning atmosphere. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Max Steiner is excellent and sets a great tone for the movie itself. A lot of film scores he composes are fantastic, and this one here is no different. ""Casablanca"" is considered one of the greatest films of cinema. Do I think it deserves such praise? No, I honestly think it's way too overrated, in my opinion. But, that doesn't mean it's void of positive things. However, at the same time, there are negatives throughout, especially in the first half. As I said earlier, half of the story works and the other half doesn't. I'm giving this film 3 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 6 out of 10 IMDB stars. A 3 out of 5 star rating is dividing mark where I differentiate a movie being good or bad. ""Casablanca"" is a marginal 3 out of 5/6 out of 10 and I consider it, by my standards, a bad movie. There are very few romance films that I actually enjoy. ""Casablanca"", in a way, is like a satire of love stories. Ordinarily, that would be a good thing, as satire movies can be decent homages to other media. Unfortunately, ""Casablanca"" is just an overrated mess that has not earned any love from me.",Casablanca

It wasn't until the arrival of the leader of the Resistance Army Victor and his wife Ilsa that all this was broken, followed by the German major who was staring at him. When Ilsa stepped into Rick's cafe for the first time, all of their memories returned to Paris. The two people admired each other and loved each other. Rick's romance moved Ilsa, and Rick's silent support for the rebels also made Ilsa appreciate. But Ilsa has entrusted Victor with him for life. Soon, the Germans captured Paris and Rick decided to take Ilsa to Casablanca. At this time, Ilsa accidentally learned that Victor had escaped from the German concentration camp. The dilemma, she chose to leave Rick, leaving Rick to wait alone in the rain. Over time, Ilsa is still the former Ilsa, but Rick is no longer like the previous Rick. He looks cold and ruthless, bureaucratic, and profit-seeking, and because Ilsa's betrayal can not be relieved for a long time, this image of Rick undoubtedly makes Ilsa feel lost. But Rick actually didn't change at all. He first agreed to hide the exit certificates of the Victors for the arrested dealer Ugarte, and provided the money for the exit certificate for a couple who wanted to leave Casablanca to settle in New York. Director Renault 's gun forced him to let Victor and his wife leave the country, and at the airport Ilsa expressed Rick 's willingness to stay in Casablanca with him for the rest of his life. The German major who was going to block was sent to Xitian, and he left Casablanca with the tacit consent of the police chief. In the troubled times, Rick loves Ilsa so persistently. At the Paris station, he continues to wait even if he is soaked. Even if he thinks that he is hurt by Ilsa, he still wants to listen to her explain the matter. Under the cold mask, Rick is willing to pay any price for the beloved person and career, and is also willing to accomplish the career and love of others. Pleasant bureaucracy has become his amulet in troubled times. Rick is clever and hides his enthusiasm with coldness. He insists on pursuing love but is tolerant to his lover who hurt himself in the past. Rick has no handsome appearance, but his charm is infinite. As Renault said, no woman will fall in love with Rick. Maybe the highest state of being is like Rick",Casablanca
207,gpeevers,Greatest Film Ever for Me,10,1 April 2019,"Why do I consider this to be the greatest film ever, to begin with I consider it to be the most enjoyable film I have ever watched and the most re-watchable. The key ingredients in my mind include; wonderful dialogue (so many quotable oft repeated lines), amazing performances, a superb story that while relatively straightforward is also highly enjoyable and finally the great black and white cinematography. Beyond these ingredients its also a film moves quickly and I can't think of a single scene I found either uninteresting or unnecessary.For those that desire a synopsis, Rick (Humphrey Bogart) is an American expatriate running a popular nightclub in Casablanca a city under Vichy control. The cool disinterested facade Rick maintains is shaken when Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) his former lover whom he thought dead appears suddenly in his club with her husband a resistance leader who requires safe passage out of German controlled territory. In order for the escape to succeed Rick must not only hide them from the Germans but also the local French police commander (Claude Raines) who is a friend but also a collaborator.My favorite performance here will always be that of Humphrey Bogart as Rick a man of nobility while evidencing ambivalence, but his performance is closely followed by the wonderful Claude Raines and the limited but iconic performances of Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. While Ingrid Bergman apparently did not enjoy her experience and it may not be among her greatest roles I thought it was still a great performance, and also that the chemistry between Bogart and herself was utterly convincing. Further I found both Paul Henreid in the thankless role of the other man in the love triangle and Conrad Veidt as the local German commander to be quite effective along with a good supporting cast.As I have seen more and more of Michael Curtiz films I have come to believe he is an underrated director, its true he was not an auteur but a studio director who made the films he was assigned and he was not apparently a pleasant person to work with he has did leave behind an incredible legacy of films.",Casablanca
208,ilpohirvonen,A Mythical Classic Defined by History and Time,10,25 January 2014,"It's quite a burden for a man to start writing a review for ""Casablanca"" (1942), the film loved and seen by everyone, and of which everything seems to be said a thousand times. The over-used statement ""we must fight for this film so that the future generations can enjoy it"" just doesn't work for ""Casablanca"" since no fighting is necessary. It doesn't need our help. Generations after generations have embraced the film and begun a beautiful friendship with it. This process has become a fundamental element in our culture which remains as time goes by.A memorable line after another, stylistic noir-aesthetics and a bunch of amazing performances make ""Casablanca"" a true cult-classic in the word's most actual meaning. Everything is just right. Even the most die-hard supporter of the auteur theory must humble before this film and admit that it is a great piece of work without a distinct author. It is a sleeper whose success and popularity can only be explained by the equal input of the director, the many writers, the actors and the audience which cherishes it so. One uniting element, a force which glues everything together can, however, be found, and that is time. ""Casablanca"" is so luminously a child of its own time that to neglect this aspect seems blasphemous. A big part of its timeless charm is its original fashion to deal with a historical moment, the relationship between individuals and even the mental events of a person at the same time and in the same equal eye. Thus ""Casablanca"" moves fluently from the general to the particular and back. Best known example is of course the beginning: the camera drills down into the globe, to Europe, to Casablanca, to Rick's Cafe Americain and finally to the privacy of Rick's mind. A conflict of reality and consciousness at the stage of the world, the café. As said innumerable times, the café is the microcosm of the world, of Europe at war. ""Casablanca"" was something that could only happen at one brief moment in the history of mankind. It is a work that was born from many factors which are forever admired such as Ingrid Bergman's natural beauty, Humphrey Bogart's powerful presence, his unique way of saying ""here's looking at you, kid,"" and an inimitable mood of solidarity. All this among many other things is veritably moving. The magical atmosphere and the mythical birth of ""Casablanca"" seem to capture the essence of an era, of a history. While it was being made there was no knowing who was going to win the war or how it all was going to end, but at least the many creators of this film had actual faith in a better tomorrow. So what else can be said? Something coherent, something persuasive, something original? Nothing, I guess. All words seem to make ""Casablanca"" sound like a banal work of sentimentality which it only transcends. Watch it -- over and over again, and again and again. And once more.",Casablanca
209,jldmp1,The Eyes Have It,6,9 September 2006,"To get straight to the point as to why I don't give this special praise: it's obsolete. Not the plot - I mean the whole manner of storytelling. It's passé, where something like ""Citizen Kane"" still speaks to us. The center of this, of course, is Bogart - an old-style Real Man, not unlike John Wayne. His acting is tight and mannered, to reflect what was expected in those days - tight control of emotional expression, control of the situation, no irony whatsoever...All sentiment is quickly dissolved in alcohol.That said, what IS worth watching is how Bergman carries emotional content - specifically, within her eyes, which tell all. ""Here's looking at you"", indeed. It's honest, and Bogie feeds off of it.And how the musical 'accompaniment' moves the pieces on the chess board. The famous ""As time goes by"" and ""La Marseillaise"" are the expressions of this force which buffets the actors within the romance, and the actors within the political intrigues. The musical performances are both 'staged for us', as was de rigeur back then, but also is indispensable to the larger narrative.Worth at least one screening, but do take it with a grain of salt.",Casablanca
210,Dockelektro,Now I finally know why this one is one of the best,10,17 March 2003,"Probably the most legendary movie of all time, I finally got to see it, it was a great hole in my movie-viewing history. And finally I got to understand why a classic movie like this has made its mark in history. The intricate political plot comes first, and sets the movie on a melting pot of the second world war, where everyone hopes and dies for an opportunity to reach the USA via Lisbon. This would provide sufficient material for hundreds of movies, but enter Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, magnificent cinematography, role model storytelling, a perfect supporting cast, some of the best dialogue ever commited to celluloid and Dooley Wilson singing THAT song, and history was made. More than 60 years of jaw-drops are sufficient to give the sceptics a good reason to make them understand that this is probably the greatest classic movie of all times, and one of the best ever made in the past, present and future.",Casablanca
211,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,Masterpiece of cinema!,8,18 June 2008,"A truly perfect movie, the 1942 Casablanca still wows viewers today, and for good reason. Its unique story of a love triangle set against terribly high stakes in the war against a monster is sophisticated instead of outlandish, intriguing instead of garish. Humphrey Bogart plays the allegedly apolitical club owner in unoccupied French territory that is nevertheless crawling with Nazis; Ingrid Bergman is the lover who mysteriously deserted him in Paris; and Paul Heinreid is her heroic, slightly bewildered husband. Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Conrad Veidt are among what may be the best supporting cast in the history of Hollywood films. This is certainly among the most spirited and ennobling movies ever made.",Casablanca
212,renegadeviking-271-528568,Casablanca review,9,16 February 2020,"Let me be frank: I love Casablanca, the film directed by Michael Curtiz and released in 1942 starring Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid. I've seen it multiple times, and each time the ending makes me cry and I find all its plot twists still exciting. Everything is amazing: its fervent anti-Nazism, the perfectly constructed sets in the Warner Bros. Studios, the memorable soundtrack, the acting, the black and white cinematography... everything! So be aware that my review is based on my enthusiastic opinion of the movie.Let's start from an introduction to the plot. Casablanca is part of unoccupied France and, although it's ruled by the Vichy government, it's the destination of many who want to flee the seemingly unstoppable Nazis. Rick (Humphrey Bogart) is an American who runs one of the busiest bars in town employing people of different nationalities including the talented African-American pianist Sam (Dooley Williams). Rick is a man without ideals who only cares for himself, as we understand from his conversations with Louis Renault (Claude Rains), the corrupt French soldier who rules the city. One night Rick comes into possession of two precious passes (stolen from an Italian called Ugarte and played by Slovak actor Peter Lorre: in 1940s' Hollywood they didn't know much about Italy). The passes could allow anyone to get to Lisbon and from there to reach safe-heaven in the United States. Shortly thereafter, the Czechoslovak refugee Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) and his wife Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) arrive right at Rick's in need of these passes. Will they get them? And what to do with Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt), the Third Reich representative who keeps Renault on a leash like a puppy?I don't want to write anything else about the plot. If you haven't seen the movie, be aware that the plot is anything but trivial and it's interesting from beginning to end. Despite being a film made almost 80 years ago, it is still incredibly fresh and it's worth watching without a shadow of a doubt. As I wrote in the beginning, everything works beautifully, including the story. I also find amusing how us Italians are treated: servants who go completely unnoticed (the military at the airport waiting for Strasser), mafia-related (Ferrari is the head of the underworld of Casablanca), and criminals (Ugarte). That's it, thank you! On the other hand, in 1942 Italy was ruled by a fascist dictator, so it seems to me that the least we could expect was to be treated well overseas! In fact, this is a very political film, which is not surprising given that it was produced by Warner who at the time was openly anti-Nazi. The film was given the green light two weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor!And coming back to the film itself, how many unforgettable dialogues! ""Play it, Sam"", ""We'll always have Paris"", ""Here's looking at you, kid"", and ""This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" not only are spoken in the movie, but have been reused everywhere in homage to Curtiz's masterpiece. And how many unforgettable scenes! La Marseillaise sung loudly to silence the hideous Nazis in the bar (although it must be said that this particular scene was copied from a similar one in the movie The Great Illusion, La Grande Illusion, 1937), the ending in the foggy airport, As Time Goes By sung by Sam a few times, the flashback in Paris with Rick and Ilsa...Ingrid Bergman is really beautiful in this film, and she has great chemistry with Humphrey Bogart. Apparently, and surprisingly, none of the main actors involved in the film believed particularly in the project... But it is well-known that anecdotes about films dating back to the first half of last century are not particularly reliable! Casablanca is a beautiful black and white film shot with spectacular sets, legendary actors and actresses, and its messages on freedom and on the need to fight fascism are still powerful and, unfortunately, very relevant today. Ciao!",Casablanca
213,Silverzero,The Sixth Greatest Film Of All Time ????????,2,13 April 2003,"First off, I'm going to say this once and make it very clear. If you liked ""Casablanca"" and though it was a work of ""sheer brilliance"" than that's fine. Hence the old saying ""each to his own"". If you didn't like it, then I agree with you. Now before you snobs critically abuse, hear me out. I saw nothing in it that was deserving of the title ""epic"". Now I am not one of those ignorami who hate movies made before 1970. Many of these live up to their name (Zulu, Singin' In The Rain, Ben-Hur). I found Casablanca to be boring overlong and poorly acted. While the work of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergmen may have been good for it's time it is insufficient compared to todays advanced standards. The settings are dull and rather unimaginative.
Sure, you ""Cinematic Elite"" may like it, but is ""Casablanca"" really the kind of movie that would appeal to the average person at their local cinema. I wanted to like the film (I really did), but I'm not going to pretend I liked it just because all of you fellow critics admired it. But that's my opinion, if you agree with me then please send a message. If you disagree, then enlighten me.",Casablanca
214,jose-cruz53,I found it mediocre,5,29 September 2012,"Set in the early 1940′s, when WW2 was ranging and the outcome of the conflict was still far from clear. Casablanca is the name of a town in the coast of North Africa that was a focal point in gathering people from all the countries involved in the war, from refugees from occupied France to Americans seeking to make out a living out of this growing consumer market generated by this focal point. The main character is an American that owns the most popular bar in the town, where ""the action happens"".I found this movie to be rather boring and mediocre, it's a typical love story movie. Nothing special and is a film full of clichés. True, it is from 1942, which may not have been cliché at the time, and in fact may have become clichéd due to this film massive influence over the next decades on the rest of Hollywood. However, I am not interested in originality and influence here, but on the pleasure that I derived from viewing the film. Regarded by many as among the greatest films ever made, I found it completely mediocre. Maybe it is this high degree of mediocrity that allows to be so highly regarded. As something that pleases everyone is something that cannot be really great to anyone.Anyway, I am not a great fan of very old films. I generally find them either clichéd and/or technically inferior to relatively more recent films (i.e. made in the 1960′s onwards). However, I found Citizen Kane, from 1941, to have been excellent. This, on the other hand, I found to be the definition of a mediocre cliché ridden film.",Casablanca

217,luke-a-mcgowan,"Moving, sensational - a triumph of the written word",10,25 November 2015,"In the 80s, Casablanca's script was sent to a number of studios under the title ""Everybody Comes to Rick's"". It was almost unanimously rejected for being boring, dated, wordy and lacking sex.What a boring, cheap world we live in.Casablanca is a masterpiece of what can be achieved with the written word. It is no surprise that this won the Oscar for Adapted Screenplay, or that six of its lines are among the most memorable of all time. The words woven by Julius J. Epstein, Philip G. Epstein and Howard Koch from Murray Burnett and Joan Alison's glorious play are hypnotic in their beauty. That Casablanca is considered one of the greatest films of all time gives hope that dialogue driven films can be great once again.Humphrey Bogart is Rick Blaine, a man driven to cynicism by heartbreak when he opened his heart to a woman for the first and last time. When the same woman (Ingrid Bergman) returns to his life with her husband in tow, complications arise - especially when he learns that the husband is a famed Czech resistance leader. Rick finds himself in a position to help them, exact revenge on the woman who broke his heart, or steal her away for himself. The word romance has been denigrated to the ""rom"" in ""romcom"" or to cover crap like 50 Shades of Grey these days, but Casablanca is a standing tribute to the word and what it means. Rick, Ilsa and Victor are all extremely relatable for the roles they play in this tale.We believe every moment of Blaine's cynicism thanks to Bogart's commanding performance, and yet it feels completely natural when he shows himself to be a fine moral character. Paul Henreid is excellent as well - in one scene where a defiant Victor leads the room in patriotic French song to drown out drunken Nazi singing, it is impossible not to want to follow him. Bergman has little to do with her character but she does it well, while Claude Renains was my personal favourite as the unscrupulously corrupt Moroccan official Captain Renault. Each character has become an icon in their own right, and upon watching this film it is impossible not to see why.The film is glorious in no small part thanks to Michael Curtiz's skilled direction. His swells the music where needed, the camera swims around effortlessly and the scenes are crafted to perfection. The recurring song ""As Time Goes By"" fits the film perfectly, and as we watch the final scene roll to a close its impossible not to be moved.",Casablanca

This also severely shades his filmography including movies like this or Robin Hood, westerns. Curtiz was ""indiffirent"" to his maniacal direction while Flynn complained about this matter, despite doing like 4 more movies with him, oh well. Doing this for entertainment is inexcusable. Poor creatures. Respect the animal kingdom. This is my initial review before learning of this:[Title:Finally saw this now political intrigueThis is a case of political intrigue but done with some vibrancy the way Michael Curtiz can eek out of this ensemble, the way he does in Adv. of Robin Hood and Dodge City. Basically it's about the friendship between Rick and Louie as if this has not been mentioned cheesillion times. Also figures Rick would have been in other 'wars' it's like every protagonist must have some 'war' background. If you're the audience for this type of movie, melodrama interspersed with great quips, political intrigue but done interestingly (unlike in politicized westerns like Santa Fe Trail, Duck you Sucker) then this is for you. Also Passage to Marseilles. As for this flick, it's a mix of those elements and utilizing the often cinematic desert for that 'intrigue.' Dope.] My advice is stick to other boring political intrigues or other Bogart movies.",Casablanca
219,eabakkum,"A review should stick to the facts, and bar emotions",7,19 November 2015,"I inherited the DVD Casablanca from my father. My parents belonged to the war generation and were liberated from the German occupation by the American army. Consequently in the fifties and sixties they received every American novelty with awe. American films had a cult status, and certainly Humphrey Bogart, and definitely the war film Casablanca. Bogard has a good name. He said rightly: ""You are not a star until they can spell your name in Karachi"". Dave Chasen said of him:""Bogey is a hell of a nice guy until 11.30 p.m. After that he thinks he is Bogart"". In Cacablanca an American hero turns out to be a veritable chevalier as well. So these are my tender emotions, when I watch the film. However, all generalizations are false. A review should stick to the facts, and bar emotions. And in the light of day the script of Casablanca looks a little shaky. The town is portrayed as the center of human trafficking, which is evidently a dirty business. Therefore it seems slightly unlikely that the local bar owner would have a heart of gold, like Bogart. Joke to make this review even better: a penguin walks into a bar, and asks the bartender: ""Have you seen my brother?"" The bartender replies: ""I don't know. What does he look like?"" In addition the film characters of Bogart and Bergman are somewhat unpleasant. Bogart keeps reproaching Bergman how she has hurt his feelings. A normal person would be glad to have gotten rid of her. Never buy a car you can't push. And Bergman is unable to chose between her two lovers. In the end she leaves the decision to Bogart, which is either preposterous or cunningly clever. Sometimes the best helping hand you can give is a good, firm push. A normal person would assume, that apparently her two lovers are both inadequate. Fortunately, even when a film has an unconvincing narrative, it can still be saved by the quality of the separate scenes. In this respect Casablanca has definitely some excellent moments to offer. A face can say so many things. Especially the mouth part. Therefore it still deserves a positive recommendation. Play it again. Don't forget to leave comments. I love it.",Casablanca

Casablanca has been analysed, re-analysed and evaluated over and over again. No doubt this is a great film and one of the finest achievements of early cinema.Featured in hundreds of top ten lists and reigning in the AFI's top 5 films of all time. I am not sure whether people have so much appreciation and respect towards this undisputed classic, or whether it is placed so highly out of sheer cinematic affection, love and respect towards its status. In my opinion 'Casablanca' is vastly overrated. While a great and often powerful film with great characters and old style over the top acting, I cannot see this film in the top 5 of all time. There are countless films I could mention that have a harsher, colder, funnier more powerful message and display it equally and better than 'Casablanca'.'Casablanca' very much belongs to the old, glamorous times of Tinseltown a film that could have been the best at its time but not anymore - not in the modern order of cinema, where gritty, uncompromising pictures dominate the industry (along with a collection of other forgettable trash), where performances move and shatter human emotion. Anyway, it is unfair to somehow criticise the importance and quality of this film, because it is still an entertaining and very good film.Humphrey Bogart plays Rick who owns the most successful joint in Casablanca, Morocco. 'Everyone comes to Rick's', corrupt officials, business men, locals - entertainment and gambling are at full force in Rick's place. Little note - Count the number of cigarettes that Bogart smokes during the film! A story of love, complex feelings, vivid characters under the shadow of war all in Casablanca.

224,tributarystu,Splendid,9,11 January 2003,"I thought I had seen a very rare few of the great movies that have been made. I now trust, I was right. SPOILERSCasablanca, a place of transit. People come, people go, like a river that doesn't stop to flow. The circumstances make Casablanca a very important place: France already invaded by the nazi troops, America seems the only way to freedom. Humans reign that city, and humans always have two sides: a sentimental side and a raw picture of themselves. Casablanca is a love story and it is a drama. It is not one of those love stories we get to see nowadays...it is something special, where actually love does not really prevail. It shows that the individual sometimes has to sacrifice himself in order for humanity to win. Some people are capable of such a sacrifice, others are not.Rick and Victor are quite the same kind of people, or at least would've been if they had met sooner. Rick changed after Ilsa left him, and he lost his will to fight...probably because there wasn't anyone to support him, because Ilsa wasn't with him. So, when he took the decision at the end he knew why he did that, and he sacrificed himself. He adapted himself to the life in Casablanca, and was doing well there...until Ilsa came along with her husband...Ilsa was for him Paris, not Casablanca. His time with Ilsa was in Paris. As she left him, he was destroyed, but found the power to keep going. Since then he didn't seem a very friendly character, but he was a good hearted one. His ""donation"" for the young couple was an act of greatness, and through that he avoided any ""less pleasent things"" for the young lady.
Victor is fighting for freedom, has suffered a lot, but knows to keep his nerve. He has a great will, and psychical strength, and his role is of a pretty great importance. There wasn't only the war all could see, there was also the war of the already conquered countries. This was a more difficult one, and for the ones who dared to take part in it, it usually meant death.
The ""poor"" corrupted captain Renault, is a nice character. He is funny, and he is the kind of guy who is on the side of those who have the power. Actually, that is quite cowardly, but he does his job pretty well. He's also got a sense of rightness, but until the end, his job is more important than that. He shows finally that he is a sentimentalist, and that he does know what is right. His decision at the end isn't quite glorious, as he at first warns Strasser, but then, as there weren't any risks involved, he decides to keep to Rick.The actors are just great, and the whole atmosphere of the movie is unique. You will feel your heart beat, you might fall in love with the characters, and you will feel the tense situations. This movie is definitely one of the best I have ever seen, if not the actual best. In a world that hasn't changed much, where money still makes the laws, love is the thing that can make you survive, and win your battles. This movie is touching...this movie is the only real romance movie I have seen, and It showed to me that I was partly wrong asking myself why only older movies are in some movie standings.",Casablanca

Its supporting cast was magnificent and huge (Claude Rains, Paul Henreid, Conrad Veidt, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, S.Z. Sakall, Dooley Wilson). ""Casablanca,"" at this moment, ranks #16 of IMDb's All Time Best 250 films and it's also on Roger Ebert's list of Great Movies.It's a tale pitting those who are (or have been) active in resistance to the Nazis mixing with those who are just trying to survive by hook or crook AND officials of Nazi Germany as well as those French officials with mixed loyalties to occupied vs. unoccupied France. Rick (Bogart) was active in the French resistance to the Nazis during which time he met and fell in love with Ilsa (Bergman). Hurriedly fleeing the Nazi occupation of Paris but feeling unexpectedly deserted by Ilsa's failure to accompany him, Rick's moved into a 'survivalist' mode in French Morocco. Ilsa has a husband (Henreid) with whom she's reunited after believing him to be dead; the couple show up unintentionally, unexpectedly, in Rick's café, searching for passage to a safer place. Claude Rains' performance, in his role as the head of French military/ security forces in Casblanca, gives THE most pivotal of all performances in elevating this film into its stellar level in the opinion of some (see comments to this effect in the Message Board for this film). After reading and reflecting on this, I fully agree.IMO, Ebert's review is VERY worthwhile & helpful (see IMDb's ""External Reviews"" of this film, then click on Chicago Sun-Times/Ebert's). In that, among other things, we learn the narrative/dialog wasn't written until they filmed it so Bergman (& others) didn't know the outcome until it was actually shot.Also, IMDb's Bio on Dooley Wilson (""Sam, the piano player""--see IMDb's ""Cast""/""bio"") shows us that his career took off after this movie. Sam's music in the café was seamlessly integrated into the narrative and becomes, essentially, a great, additional, supporting cast member. I don't recall Bergman ever being so lovely--but how in the world did women of that time pack and travel with those hats?",Casablanca
226,Gubby-Allen,Dull & way overrated,3,18 April 2002,"I'm not going to slate the film any more than that, as millions still love it now, so it must be me that's in the wrong, but it was such a hard film to watch.The acting was faultless. But that's it really. The ending going against typical Hollywood happy ones, is the only other praise I could give this.The 1st half hour or so of Casablanca wasn't bad at all & set up some fairly interesting premises. Likewise the last 15 minutes was an ending that still stands up well today. But the period between 30-75 minutes was 3/4 of an hour of chronic boredom. There was no character to connect to or like until the finale & what plot there was, was in no way enjoyable. Good cinematography, romance & Nazi's together seem to account for the popularity of this, but in reality it was poorly executed & lacked a plot that could hold the viewer's attention.There was too much dialogue sometimes & seemed an attempt to cram as many 'cool' lines into the film as possible. Some of them were good & fitted in well, but others, particularly ""here's looking at you kid"" don't hold up well at all, & by the 3rd or 4th time, made you cringe.A 50 word review of the film makes it seem fairly straightforward. Granted, the main plot was, but I had real trouble understanding the sub-plots & relevance of some of the secondary events & storylines or characters.Though this wasn't an awful film at all & may go up a mark or two more with another viewing. But like Citizen Kane which I found far worse, it seems another one thats liked because it's been drummed into everyone for 50 years that it's a classic & so we're supposed to like it. But then what do I know, I'm just an ordinary bloke.3/10",Casablanca
227,illbebackreviews,"""I think this may just be the beginning of great motion pictures""",10,27 January 2013,"Casablanca is a 1942 romance/drama movie that focuses on a man named Rick who takes refugee in Casablanca where he then runs a famous saloon and a young lady with whom he shared an affair with once named Iilsa. The film follows the story of Iilsa, who is desperate to get out of Casablanca for her husband's safety and Rick, her former lover who secretly has these letters that will help him get anywhere.Casablanca came out an year after the 'greatest movie of all time' Citizen Kane. I strongly believe that this movie is far superior to Citizen Kane in every way possible. This movie is one of the greatest movies ever made and deserves to be crowned the greatest motion picture of all time Everything in this film works brilliantly. The story works extremely well including the plot of the stolen documents as well as characters like Louis and Victor Lazlo. The characters in this movie are so much more interesting than that in Citizen Kane and the greatest thing about this movie is easily the romance and the amazing chemistry between Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. That was a phenomenal relationship to which we are emotionally drawn in. It is as if our souls during the movie get sucked into the drama that is going on.Citizen Kane being a movie of around the same duration as Casablanca felt far longer than Casablanca. The acting in the movie was just brilliant and the way the film was brilliantly directed and written just made the film all the better.There were so many powerful scenes in the movie especially the scene where a drunk Rick has a flashback to him and Iilsa's relationship. That to me, is some phenomenal film making which immediately made me love the characters more and more.The film to me was extremely emotional, extremely interesting and in the end, I just wanted much more. I don't normally say that to movies but this movie made me wish there was so much more going on.In conclusion, Casablanca is an absolute must see as the film is flawless and absolutely remarkable in every possible way.",Casablanca
228,ArmandoManuelPereira,"My Appreciation For The Film Has Lessened, Though Still A Classic And Worth Watching",8,29 March 2020,"My appreciation for the movie has lessened each time I have watched it. To be sure it has a lovely and iconic ending which I still love. But I never enjoyed the flashback to Paris. Nor do I like the opening 5-10 minutes. All the best scenes (apart from the last one) take place at Ricks. Which are, in my opinion, the best reasons to watch the film. Bogart is mostly good, even really good at times, and the supporting cast is strong. Though I do not find Bergman all that alluring, despite her beauty. Is this a classic movie? Definitely. Flawed? I think so.",Casablanca
229,MovieGuy109,Hollywood at its most significant,10,29 October 2011,"Casablanca is a Hollywood movie made in the peak of Hollywood filmmaking. A powerful romance so well-acted by a superb cast that includes Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Claude Rains. The writing is excellent with a pitch-perfect running time and many lines that have become classic. All of these elements are expertly brought together by director Curtiz in his best film. It stands alongside Citizen Kane and Gone with the wind for the best movie ever made. It certainly features Hollywood at the peak of its form an engaging acting at the top of its form. Not one moment I regretted watching for a second but the end is the best part.",Casablanca
230,antagonist117,A simple formula never done better,10,25 March 2014,"It's almost axiomatic that a ""prestige drama,"" the kind that contends for awards and aims to join the canon, must combine a love story with a weighty historical plot line. Best Picture winners ""The Deer Hunter,"" ""Out of Africa,"" ""The English Patient,"" ""Titanic,"" as well as countless films that didn't take the Academy's top prize, all fit neatly into this category. It is probably too simplistic to say that all these movies are on some level attempts to remake ""Casablanca,"" and certainly movies, not to mention plays and books, had discovered long before ""Casablanca"" that mixing romantic drama and historical drama makes for good entertainment. But ""Casablanca"" became a template and a benchmark. These facts are attested to by the number of its one-liners that became part of the cultural lexicon, and by its apparently permanent residence near the top of critical and popular lists of great films. One important element that sets it apart from run-of-the-mill, wanna-be historical romances is its humor, an ingredient many ""serious"" movies neglect to utilize. One moment the French national anthem brings us to our feet and tears to our eyes, and the next we are laughing at one of the funniest lines and most imitable comic deliveries in movies, Claude Rains's ""I am shocked, shocked..."" Every scene belongs almost to a different genre: the script rotates jokes, intrigue and espionage, a dreamy romance in flashback form, a will-they-or-won't-they soap opera in the present, musical numbers, and high-minded talk of war and freedom. But for all that, it doesn't feel like the movie is overstuffed or that there's even particularly a lot going on beneath the surface. It is tempting to read the studiously-neutral but soft-hearted American Rick (Humphrey Bogart) as a metaphor for the U.S.'s reluctance to intervene in European conflicts, and it is interesting to observe the ways this wartime Hollywood movie depicts European refugees of various ages, nationalities, and genders, but in this case it is more fun to simply be swept along by the movie as a great piece of entertainment. ""Casablanca"" is ""just"" a simple story well-told, set in an exotic and dangerous and alluring locale, and it might be that better than anything else has ever been that.",Casablanca
231,JoshtheGiant,Wonderful,10,4 January 2006,Casablanca is a flawless film that is both sad and hilarious. It is a wonderful melodrama that keeps you hooked and although it is not in my top ten films it is a great film. The plot is wonderful and always makes perfect sense. It is a little melodramatic yes but how could they keep our attention with something more like real life. The screenplay is just as amazing with flawless and quotable dialogue and amazing twists and characters. The performances are the best part of the movie. Humphrey Bogart gives one of his best performances and is amazing but it is Ingrid Bergman who is the standout. She gives one of the best performances in movie history. The direction was also flawless and deserved the Oscar for sure. The visual effects are very good but not as flawless as the rest of the movie. They sometimes look fake but always work fine the way they are. Casablanca is a classic that should be seen by everyone. Particularly teenagers. That may sound weird but its true. We really connect with it.,Casablanca
232,krational66,Simple,7,9 April 2020,"Even 70 years later, it is still a classic. Photography, actors, music, sets... Except for the slightly cliched plot, it's almost flawless. The scene is rarely focused on the pub, but never dull. Both the leading role and the supporting role have their bright spots. What's more, 70 years ago, before the end of world war ii? But how to see the end of the final are full of obscure gay love ah... That sheriff is so loving",Casablanca

234,daoldiges,Solid Fundamentals,8,28 February 2021,"It hard to find something to say about Casablanca that hasn't already been said but in brief: The casting is great, with my personal call out to Claude Raines, who with many wonderful performances under his belt, this is my favorite. The B&W cinematography is rich and saturated just right. The story is solid. This film didn't really hit me much the first time I saw it and it took a second viewing to really appreciate. Check it out.",Casablanca
235,GeoPierpont,For the Corrupt Poor,8,9 April 2015,"What a cast of characters, if you are familiar with the careers of the major and minor leads, this is old school film buff heaven! I treasure a delicious intrigue and Casablanca delivers on all fronts. There is the foreign affairs effect, tense drama, fear filled moments, historical references, comedy, music, and a conflicted romance. For 1942 or thereabouts, not much competition imho.My major issue lies with the semblance of a decision for Ilsa regarding leaving her husband. Who could ever find this a plausible plot given she is already married, in love with the cause, comprehends her role in it, and deeply admires him since childhood. I did not find anything believable in a suspense ending given the aforementioned elements, but only the possible Nazi confrontation before the plane departure. The unexpected one liners were truly hilarious amidst the tense drama of escapes, persecution and liberation. The many representations of foreigners aligned as allies was inspiring, to wit the German vs French hit parade performance. I had not heard ""La Marseillaise"" since High School and was impressed I was able to recall so many lines. Although many consider this a propaganda film, it accomplishes this with subtlety. The drop of the Vichy water bottle in the trash bin hints at the power of many countries aligned to defeat the Axis.High recommend for foreign war POV, star performances, life in French Morocco, and a black and white blue parrot.",Casablanca
236,drunken_munki,Humphrey Bogart drips with class and style,9,19 October 2020,"I love this movie, and especially for what they managed to achieve in 1942. The story is great and provides a twist to the standard Nazi plotlines in many movies. This film takes a close up view of people caught up in a bad time.The framing of Casablanca seems to be a metaphor for the whole of Europe, and even perhaps as a figurative representation of humanity. A little like purgatory, filled with deplorable and desperate peoples. Bogart is wonderful, filling in as the host and owner of a popular gin bar. The music is lovely and the singing from the support actor is an excellent backdrop of the bar.The several interesting characters in the film are another plus, all these deplorable people having their own motivations and desires to leave Casablanca. Of course the long lost flame coming back to haunt Rick was excellently handled. And Rick's eventual turn about of such a horrid woman was an excellent scene.For everything this does right, I look at the likes of 'Citizen Kane' and wonder how did that movie get rated so high? Conspiracy? A massive inside joke? I have no idea.9/10 this is an excellent classic and should be watched by all.",Casablanca
237,simon_booth,"It's a classic, no question there",10,5 February 2006,"I'm a bit late catching up with this film, and wondered if I could enjoy it having seen/heard so many clips + quotes over the years. The answer is ""yes""! Even though everyone on the planet must have had the ending spoilered for them by now, the film still delivers entertainment and quality in spades. The script is deliciously witty and full of drama, the characters wonderfully crafted and 3-dimensional, the cinematography and sound as classy as anything in its day. It's fascinating to compare a film like Casablanca to the dross Hollywood produces these days... so much more money, technology and every other resource available, and they can't produce anything remotely as good!",Casablanca
238,Sober-Friend,A Perfect Film But Let's Clear Up A Few Rumors,10,25 March 2018,"In December 1941, American expatriate Rick Blaine owns an upscale nightclub and gambling den in Casablanca. ""Rick's Café Américain"" attracts a varied clientele, including Vichy French and German officials, refugees desperate to reach the still-neutral United States, and those who prey on them. Although Rick professes to be neutral in all matters, he ran guns to Ethiopia during its war with Italy and fought on the Loyalist side in the Spanish Civil War.Petty crook Ugarte boasts to Rick of ""letters of transit"" obtained by murdering two German couriers. The papers allow the bearers to travel freely around German-controlled Europe and to neutral Portugal, and are priceless to the refugees stranded in Casablanca. Ugarte plans to sell them at the club, and asks Rick to hold them. Before he can meet his contact, Ugarte is arrested by the local police under the command of Captain Louis Renault, the unabashedly corrupt Vichy prefect of police. Ugarte dies in custody without revealing that he entrusted the letters to Rick.Now let's clear up some rumors. Muh has been written about ""Casablanca"" but a few rumors often get repeated. One of them is Ingrid Bergman saying ""The screenplay was not completed when they started shooting"". That is not true. Warner Brothers never put a film into production unless they had a complete screenplay. Now they kept a few things secret from Ingrid Bergman. She did not have a complete screenplay. The director and Warners thought they would get a better performance out of her if she did not know a few things. However it was not uncommon for ""things to change"" while a film was in production. ""Casablanca was no exception! Another rumor was that Ronald Reagan was cast to play Ric! He was only ""thought of"" but for only a few seconds. Almost everyone in Hollywood was until Bogart was cast! Rumor #3 The film was an out of control production! This is not true! This was shot in 18 days. Another things people don't quit notice is how fast people talk in this film! The film runs 102 minutes. The screenplay is 125+ minutes. The average screenplay is one minute of screen time per written page! If this film was made by today's standards it would run almost 45 minutes longer.Now if you never seen the film you are lucky. The film is exciting as it is romantic. Not one minute of screen time is squandered. Today's filmmakers would not know how to make a film like this unless ""Batman"" plays Ric!",Casablanca
239,lyubitelfilmov,Incredible luck or Throwing the soul of a cynical romantic,7,1 May 2021,"Melodrama. Screen adaptation of the play ""Everybody Comes to Rick"" by playwrights Murray Barnett and Joan Alison. Happy May Day, comrades! It's time to go outside and clean up some of your own home. Is not it? So I think so. And since May has come, this month I traditionally watch military films, and then I decided to get to this cult classic, which occupies the highest lines in the lists of the best paintings, and is not inferior in popularity to the most modern megablockbusters. And although I have already pricked myself several times because of this, nevertheless I cast aside doubts and looked at this picture - and I was not disappointed, in large part. And here's my brief opinion - Throwing the soul of a cynical romantic. Despite the fact that I liked the picture, I will consider both its advantages and disadvantages, which I could not do without. At this point, let me finish with the introduction and get to the point.So, the advantages:
1. Scenario - the action of the picture takes place in Casablanca - the port city of French Morocco at the end of 1941, which is ruled by the dictatorial regime of Vichy (after the defeat of France in 1940). Casablanca serves as a transit city between refugees from Europe and the New World, where all these unfortunates are trying to get, using money and power. Of course, there are also cunning businessmen in the city who make fortunes out of these people. Corrupt police. And here the cafe ""At Rick's"" is comfortably located, which is popular with all this public, since its owner does not meddle in politics, and does not attract unnecessary attention to himself, on a short leg with the prefect of police. But the war pushes both opposing sides together in his institution, and then forgotten love lights up with renewed vigor. How should Riku proceed now? Which side to choose? What will his heart decide? What will be the ending? There is drama here, but not much, since the script focuses on the romantic line of the characters, and everything else is just a background for the development of events. The script is simple, but attractive in its simplicity. And although the ending is obvious almost from the very beginning, you are still interested in watching the picture. There were no shoals and logical holes. I am already silent about dialogues and cult phrases. Therefore, to while away the evening is definitely suitable.2. The romantic line is definitely good. Yes, a reflection on the lost love, yes a love triangle, yes cliches, yes predictability - but the dialogues, ""spark"", and the great acting performance of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman did not let you get bored when watching. Moreover, lovers here are completely different people with their own view of things, who have excellent memories of the past, which even now look good.3. Atmosphere - the feeling of a blazing Second World War, which in 1942 was still in full swing, is present from the first to the last frame. It is especially bright in Casablanca, where many people and forces clashed, eager to destroy each other. This is especially evident in the example of the police prefect - a corrupt official, a French patriot, who is forced to submit to a German officer who has arrived from Europe, since the prefect - in the service of the Vichy government - is essentially a collaborationist. And not only him, because there are many minor characters, by the way about them.4. Vivid minor characters - from the Russian bartender (thanks to Leonid Kinski for such a charismatic hero) and ending with dishonest merchants. Frenchmen, policemen, ""slippery"" types, German officers, Italians. All of them are of interest, and the picture perfectly shows their real relationships, ranging from the Germans, who consider Italians weaklings and cowards, and ending with the French, although they lost the war, but did not accept this fact, and therefore are ready to go after General de Gaulle ... Well, and cynics who simply cash in on human grief, without a hint of feelings.5. Music - of which I can only mention songs performed by Sam, played by the negro Dooley Wilson - who was an actor and singer in his life, and very popular. It is he who is remembered most of all. What about the rest of the music? It will do.Well, thank you very much for the stage of the performance of La Marseillaise! Sang along in unison!So the cons:
1. Globe at the beginning of the picture - more precisely, the western borders of the Soviet Union and Poland. Maybe this is a cant of the picture, or maybe the creators just took this globe from another picture. Unknown. We will consider this an inaccuracy.2. Cult status - here the picture was just lucky, because it came out just during Operation Torch - the landing of allied forces in North Africa, including in Casablanca (which is partly why it was renamed shortly before the film's release). And after that they were often shown on American TV. Although, judging impartially and objectively - ""Casablanca"" is a good, but a passing picture, which is perfect for a romantic evening, but to call it ""the best picture"" or ""the greatest picture of all times and peoples"" would be very dishonest and even selfish. Just ""Casablanca"" was lucky to get out at the right time and in the right place, that's all!A little about the main characters:
1. Rick Blaine performed by Humphrey Bogart is a cynical restaurant owner who has to sort out his feelings, decide on a side in a raging war, and decide in love, where can we go without it. Despite the protruding cynicism, both in words and in deeds, at heart he is a romantic, capable of performing a strong and noble deed for the sake of justice. I saw Humphrey before only in the melodrama ""Sabrina"" with Audrey Hepburn, where he perfectly played a similar character, and here he obviously learned to be such a convincing romantic on the screen. Bravo Humphrey!2. Ilsa Lund performed by Ingrid Bergman - Rick's beloved and the wife of Victor Laszlo, one of the leaders of the Resistance movement, who wants to take advantage of meeting Rick in order to leave Casablanca as soon as possible. Shown as a romantic and purposeful girl who rushes between two men. I liked Ingrid here. Clever girl! You believe her heroine.3. Victor Laszlo performed by Paul Henrade is an ardent anti-fascist who arrived in Casablanca in order to find a way to get to the New World, because the Nazis are looking for him for his active work, but there is no reason for arrest, because Casablanca is the territory of France, where there are subtleties. An ardent fighter, who piously believes in victory, whom Rick partly admires. Paul perfectly managed to convey the inner world and ideals of his hero, thanks in part to which Germany was eventually defeated four years later.You know, despite the fact that seventy-nine years have passed since the picture was released, it is still good, and deserves your attention (just do not over praise it), and worth watching.As a result, we have a good melodrama, with a simple and interesting script, bright memorable characters, great atmosphere, pleasant romance and great acting, especially Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.My rating is 7 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",Casablanca

243,JaydoDre,Good. That is all.,8,13 December 2014,"Casablanca is a difficult movie to review because there is nothing particularly wrong with it, but also nothing particularly excellent. It is more about whether or not you like its style.Its style is very misty-eyed. The insisting violin vibrato in the high register tries to cut into your heart, as the main hero talks harshly to the damsel, but inside we all know that in actuality he really loves her. This film can be impersonated by a lady who sighs as she holds her wrist against her forehead in a gesture of fainting.Is it cheesy though? Well, no, it does not go that far. It stays tasteful and professional, but its style is very clearly defined and may not appeal to all.The undertones of the story are about a refugee crisis and anti-Nazi resistance, but the movie is really about the relationship and conversations between the main characters, and to its credit those interactions are good.Humfrey Boghart is not my favorite actor. He is the poster child of the over-stylised acting that was so persistent in the first part of the 20th century, but this is probably one of his best roles. The most interesting is probably Claude Rains who plays an opportunistic French officer.It is competently made but there is nothing that strikes as particularly special about this film. There are worse ways to spend an evening than watching a good quality film, but all the hype that goes as far as perceiving this film as the best ever made is really unnecessary.",Casablanca

Hailed as maybe the best movie of all time... So, how was it? Of course - romance to a hilt, but it's utterly charming, finely produced, with amusing dialog and a clear political (unavoidable in a historical context) and moral human message. And of course, Bogart is massive in his screen presence. So, I was quite pleased to lose my 'Casablanca virginity', to put it fittingly!But I found it to have problems shaking the fact that it's a filmed stage play, which makes it move a tad too slow for its own good, therefore the dramatic elements feel very controlled, contained and lose vital impact. Best scene I found apart from the classical ones: The old couple rehearsing their newly learned English lines! Does anyone else feel the need to review older movies both from a cinematically historical perspective of importance... and then neutrally and separately - for what it's actually worth on it's own?

The whole story is very touching, and all the cast have given shining performances to the audience. When you see Rick's frown, you will be able to tell how much pain he suffered and concealed in the deep heart while you don't know whether he will return to the ""bright side"" or not. All the other actors also done quite well. They may amuse you in a serious way or in a comic way--that is to be discovered by yourself. As time goes by, the song AS Time Goes By has occupied a part of American culture or even a part of the whole world's culture. I have heard it in a couple of advertisements or in the beginning of a TV programme. That was before watching the film. However, it is always like a warm stream running out of my heart each time I hear the song, after I saw it. Everybody has something within, which is extremely unique, precious and beautiful. No matter how many years have past, we can still remember it as something shining. That is the emotion held by Rick and other two main characters in the ""crazy world"" of WW2, as individuals, as human.Most people defined it as ""perfact"", while I think it could be better if the ending is not so dramatic and comfort and ""with everyone satisfied"". Rick has chosen to fight again for the bright side, maybe for the last time. So he deserved the very punishment that Nazis would give. So Rick could have turned away after the plane's taking off, leaving his fate to audience to guess.If the movie had gone in this way, I could have been even more satisfied because I am quite realistic. However, it is actually made during the war and people need more hope as Rick needed, as time needed. I am also not supposed to question the origin arrangement......My rating is 9/10",Casablanca
251,malvernp,Claude Rains In One Of. His Greatest Roles!,10,22 February 2021,"Claude Rains may have been the most versatile and gifted film actor of his generation. Whether playing a romantic but amoral attorney in his early film Crime Without Passion, a corrupt US Senator with just a smidgen of decency in Frank Capra's Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, a sensitive and wise counselor/advisor to Bette Davis in Now, Voyager or the compassionate angel who helps to make everything turn out just right for Robert Montgomery in Here Comes Mr. Jordan-every role Rains played emerged as a unique creation of acting craftsmanship--much like a fine tailor made suit. Rains's talent had no limit, and his range was only affected by materialistic box office considerations of his height and advancing age.Before he came to Hollywood to make The Invisible Man In 1933, Rains was already a serious highly respected actor and drama teacher in England, whose students included John Gielgud and Laurence Olivier. His amazing voice was a dazzling instrument, and when American audiences first heard it in The Invisible Man--they soon forgot that it came from a short middle-aged man who was not particularly handsome in the usual sense of the word. His remarkable skill in constructing characters that might be charming, wry, interesting and menacing all at the same time was unmatched in the Hollywood of his time. No wonder that Davis approached her several films with him respectfully. Rains was an actor that a collaborator would take for granted only at his or her own peril!Rains received four official supporting actor Oscar nominations during his long Hollywood career. Unfortunately, he won none. His sardonic corrupt French policeman in Casablanca was one of the very best of these nominated roles. Many of his lines spoken in this film are now legendary and known from memory by its many fans. In Casablanca, Rains projected cynicism, good humor, controlled anger and quiet courage all together in a way that made the total result completely believable. You wanted him to succeed because his character was just so likable!The chemistry that produced Casablanca as a treasured classic was the result of good fortune that allowed a truly remarkable company of talented people to come together for this unique event. An important contributing ingredient to its success was the acting genius of Claude Rains. To those who love this film--and they are too numerous to contemplate--Rains helped to create ""the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""",Casablanca
252,stimpy_tr,What a mess!,7,3 December 2020,"The movie starts in a very exciting manner. The ambience in Casablanca and Rick's place is very cheerful. Situation of Casablanca is complicated such that it seems to have been stuck in between a Nazi army and the army of Vichy France. Many intriguing events take place one after another in Rick's place as if the outlaws in the city has no other place to go.What is disturbing for me is that there are too many plot holes and twists. Also a woman with two lovers is depicted as an angel just because she is beautiful. Morever, Rick abandons all the fortune he made out of his place in one night and decides to murder a Nazi major just to help the love of his life escape from Casablance with another man. How romantic! I wonder how many people bursted into tears for that.

(""Cuddles"") Sakall much of whose family was actually wiped out in the holocaust and who has a sizable role in this film as Carl the Waiter.The inevitable Sydney Greenstreet plays a friendly rival of Rick Blaine's American Cafe and, of course, Dooley Wilson as the pianist and singer Sam of ""play it again"" fame. No Hoagy Carmichael (Bogie's later pianist) he, and so his piano playing had to be dubbed as his voice was not. And Claude Rains as the corrupt Captain Louis Renault (""I'm shocked, shocked"" and ""Round up the usual suspects"")The Song, ""as Time Goes By"" by Herman Hupfeld was basically the theme song of ""Casablanca"" and was used throughout as part of the complete score.The villainous Nazi Major Strasser was, of course, played by Conrad Veidt who was not Jewish but whose third wife was. Mr. Veidt, however, told the nazis that he was himself Jewish making it certain that he would have to leave Germany.

The aforementioned stars, along with Humphrey Bogart entered into the mood from the start, and brought us one of the best movies ever.  The supporting cast, particularly Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet and Conrad Veidt were spot on, and added so much to it.

The film is highly dependent on its players - apart from Rains, none of the support really has  ample time to sketch much of anything in depth, but they	re all such strong, persuasive types that the movie feels like an extraordinarily deep canvas. Compared to some other movies, Bogart's hard edge is too much a pose, too obviously ready to be wiped away; and although the movie draws strength from its almost mythic location, it's also a way of reducing the actual political elements to the point of near-abstraction - the elements of personal morality flourish here, but then they have an unnatural advantage. None of this matters very much. The movie has such huge emotional depth, representing such an enormous array of incident, that it's a triumph of economy at 100 minutes or so. Bogart is at the absolute peak of anyone's form here - there's no strained sentiment, no apparent grasping for charismatic distance or charm - he's the peak of moral self-definition interacting with a complex world on its own terms.",Casablanca

260,budmassey,Can a movie be PERFECT?,10,6 July 2001,"Little can be said about this masterpiece that has not been said. Every superlative applies. The people involved in the making of Casablanca were convinced they were making just another movie meant to inspire patriotism in an America teetering on the brink of war. Indeed, in many ways, this is precisely how the movie was planned. But somewhere between then and now, Casablanca emerged as the most iconic movie of all time. The story takes place shortly before America's entry into WWII. Casablanca, while unoccupied, was controlled by Vichy and was a dangerous place for enemies of the Reich. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) runs a café where everyone comes, and where shady transactions are conducted by the French Resistance. Rick maintains a delicate neutrality, with duplicitous cooperation from the local police captain, Louis Renault (Claude Rains). Then the Czechoslovakian resistance leader arrives with a woman in tow, but not just any woman. She is Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), his wife, although we discover she had a passionate affair in Paris with Rick some time ago. The rest of the story revolves around what Orson Welles called a McGuffin – the letters of transit. That no such papers could have existed is immaterial. The McGuffin helps the central characters discover their true nature and make decisions that will change them forever. But the story is in the experience of it. As you are drawn into Casablanca, its intrigue, love, betrayal and redemption, you are transformed by it utterly. Long before postmodern deconstructionism made it de rigueur to send up treasured metaphors only to bring them crashing down, Casablanca wove them into a story that fills you with nostalgia only experienced in the collective memory of our culture, as if each event happened directly to you. Embarrassingly rich with talent, the film's gravitational center is the bristling energy that radiates from Bogart and Bergman. They are luminous beings whose monochromatic images will haunt your memory forever. Paul Henreid's Victor Laszlo, like his portrayal of Jerry Durrance the same year in Now, Voyager, in a lesser movie would have been legendary. The fact that Casablanca engulfs him, as well as Claude Raines, Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet, is a yardstick against which Casablanca must be measured. The cast of Casablanca, in fact, is its true treasure. Humphrey Bogart appears in his first romantic lead, yet maintains the toughness and cynicism of the thug image Hollywood manufactured for him. His shell of cynicism notwithstanding, Bogart's character reveals himself to be a wounded, vulnerable man, consumed by bitterness and regret. Yet he manages, from within despair, to reinhabit his former self, rising to an epic heroism which, the film suggests, is within each of us. Bergman's astonishing beauty illuminates her character. Who could gaze into those vast, glistening eyes and not be moved? Although, apropos of the time, she is portrayed as a possession to be won or lost, she transcends that image with each glance. Her immense beauty is an almost desperate counterpoint to the struggles taking place before her. Paul Henreid has been roundly criticized for not being the thespian equal of his costars. But he plays his role perfectly as the self-righteous prig who represents Ilsa's tragic alternative to the man she truly loves. Had he been otherwise, Ilsa's choice would have been easy and the story would not have worked. Henreid, like every aspect of this masterpiece, is an archetype without which the story could not take place. The second tier actors were equally amazing. Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Sidney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre were stars in their own rights. In fact, Veidt was the highest paid actor in the film. They are delightfully complex, and yet necessarily abstract, providing still more archetypes around which to anchor the story. Rains, as the servile Vichy toady, provides delicious moments of comic irony. Much has also been made of the repressed homosexual overtones of Renault's relationship with Rick, and Rick's relationship with Sam. Whether intentional or not, this aspect merely deepens the humanity of the characters. Even the supporting cast was extraordinary, many of them actual refugees from Europe, lending the story an aching realism. The famous ""Battle of the Anthems"" scene plays so real because the extras were truly moved by it, each recalling his own real-life exodus from the war. If director Michael Curtiz was not a peer with contemporary auteur directors, his signature is nonetheless present in Casablanca's taut, scintillating structure. The numerous screenwriters each provided something unique. Even the cinematography was inspired, masterfully playing with images of captivity and conflict produced by shadows precisely placed for effect. In the end, everything flows seamlessly, the very definition of synergy. It would be criminal, though, after considering the details of perhaps the greatest film of all time, not to come back to the personal, visceral experience of it. No matter how many times I watch Casablanca, it never fails to move me. Far from diminishing over time, the full experience matures and deepens with each viewing. I still hold my breath as each iconic moment unfolds. I still gasp when I look into Ilsa's eyes the first time. But the true measure of Casablanca is the enduring respect it garners from film buffs the world over. Delicately dancing around the easy epic of World War II, the film shows us instead how great events can conspire to make even the most reprobate existence monumental.This is, in my mind, the closest thing to cinematic perfection we are ever likely to see. Unfortunately, the rich cultural references will seem somewhat abstruse for viewers not familiar with history leaving the full appreciation of Casablanca beyond reach. But if you are equipped with both a brain and a heart, this movie will move you and thrill you like few can.",Casablanca

262,loza-1,I'll tell you what this film is about.,10,5 July 2005,"What is this film about? All sorts of explanations have been put forward. It's a romance, a melodrama - even the intriguing explanation that it was the representation of a love triangle involving the director, a notion which falls flat, because the director did not write the script. In fact, it is a good old fashioned war propaganda film. Why should the Americans enter the Second World War?Although the film is set in North Africa, all the principal characters are either American or from somewhere in Europe. The Americans are from a country that is ""neutral."" Most of the others, the French, the Czech with the Hungarian name etc, are embroiled in the war somewhere.Among all the turmoil in Casablanca Rick Blaine has built himself a little neutral island. It's cosy, with his chess set in his little office, with Dooley Wilson at the piano, and Sasha the Russian barman. The turmoil can go on but Rick Blaine, like the USA, is strictly neutral.But Rick cannot remain neutral for long, and sooner or later, the second world war - in the shape of Ilsa and her boyfriend - turn up at his door. Rick must now take an active part in the war, just as the USA have to join the fighting.The final scene show the beginning of a beautiful friendship between the reluctant collaborator of a Frenchman and his American ally.The film may have been a message to the people of America or even a message to the President (casablanca is Spanish for white house). But the message is there. It's 1942, and it's off to war for the USA; because it is inevitable that the USA are going to get embroiled in this one way or another.Those who have read some of my other reviews know that I am quite capable of slitting the throats of sacred cows. In this case I am quite happy to give it 10 out of 10, because it IS a good film; and it is not the pseudo-intellectuals who will tell you it is a good film; it is the ordinary filmgoing public who will tell you. It is heavily layered, well acted, competently directed, and Orson Welles is nowhere to be seen!There are some reviewers who say that the acting in this is bad. When did Bogart, Bergman, Claude Rains or Conrad Veidt ever act badly? They couldn't if they tried.No other director but Curtiz could have directed this. Interesting is the scene where two factions sing against one another, a device he has used in at least one other of his films. For this film, Curtiz won an about-time-too Oscar for best director.Another great thing about this film is that it is so rich in content that you can play it again, Sam, as often as you like.",Casablanca

The place, Casablanca, becomes a citadel of despondence and despair for so many people, yet for Rick and Ilsa, (Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman) the situation is tailor made for a passionate redemption!!

267,Shostakovich343,Casablanca,10,30 July 2020,"I watch ""Casablanca"" at least twice a year. Once with my father, who loves it as much as I do, and once with someone who says he or she doesn't like black-and-white films. ""Casablanca"" has never failed to change their mind.Lately, I found myself wondering what makes its appeal so universal. Perhaps that ""Casablanca"" really isn't a complicated story when you get down to it. In essence, it is a love triangle: Cynical night club-owner Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) must let go the woman he loves (Ingrid Bergman) to serve the greater good. She wants to support her husband Victor Lászlo (Paul Henreid) in his resistance against the Nazis, but is confronted with the fact that she loves Rick more than him.Drama hardly comes more basal than that, and that is a strength. ""Casablanca"" has clear and relatable conflict on all three levels. Inner: Rick has to stand up and care about others again. Personal: Rick and Ilsa must go their own ways despite loving each other. And extra-personal: the evil Nazis must be defeated. If ""Casablanca"" does not harbour the dark chasms of an Ingmar Bergman or Carl Th. Dreyer film, its drama serves as rock solid foundation for a great story to be laid upon.Perhaps unsurprisingly, the film's most complex character stands outside of the triangle. This is Casablanca's corrupt chief of police, Louis (played by Claude Rains, who between ""The Sea Hawk"", this, and ""Lawrence of Arabia"" developed a habit of playing morally grey bureaucrats.) He is a government official, but gambles at the tables he is supposed to close. He has been a friend of Rick since they fought side-by-side in the last World War, but has no qualms about drinking his champagne without paying. He is as gallant a Frenchman as they come, but shamelessly collaborates with the Nazi occupiers.His back-and-forth with Rick is one of the film's best aspects. Their bonding over cynicism contains a finely laced tragedy and heaps of wit besides. Too often, people forget that ""Casablanca"" is a very funny film, but drama is really only part of the picture. The quips are on par with Billy Wilder's best work, and the running jokes should be taught (indeed, are taught) for their perfect set-ups and pay-offs.Small wonder ""Casablanca"" is a mandatory subject in film school. It is the platonic ideal of traditional narrative. Every scene subtly subverts your expectation and flawlessly sets up the next one. The romance serves as solid core, balanced out by humour, tension and cynicism aplenty.The equilibrium ""Casablanca"" hereby achieves is truly lightning in a bottle. All artists involved were industry professionals, people who knew what they were doing, yet never managed to capture the same level of excellence again.Nor, perhaps, did anyone else. ""Casablanca"" represents Golden Age Hollywood at a height that only ""Gone with the Wind"" can match. It is without doubt one of the greatest films ever made -- anyone who has seen it thinks so, and anyone who has yet to see it will think so.",Casablanca

Unfortunately, the prices of the ticket, the popcorn and the soda did not go back in time but if there is a movie that is worth every cent of admission and snacks it is Casablanca.For the very few of you who are not familiar with the plot of Casablanca here is a very brief synopsis of the classic. It is WWII and Casablanca is a haven for refugees who are escaping the stronghold of the Nazi military in eastern Europe. Escapees are willing to do whatever it takes to Get from Eastern Europe to Casablanca, Morocco to Lisbon, Portugal and finally, to absolute freedom in America. Rick's Americain Cafe is a hotbed of political corruption and refugee deal making in the tumultuous city of Casablanca. As interesting and complex the goings ons at Rick's may be it really just serves as a sub-plot to one of the most famous love affairs in movie history between the beautiful Ilsa Lund played by Ingrid Bergman and the timeless, cool, calm and collected Rick Blaine who owns Rick's Americain Cafe played by, of course, Humphrey Bogart.I am not going to waste your time by going any further with the plot summary of this movie but I will say that with each time I see this phenomenon of a movie I am more and more amazed by the screen writing of Philip and Julius Epstein with Howard Koch. Incredible as the performances that are given by Peter Lorre(Ugarte), Claude Rains (Capt. Renault), Paul Henried (Victor Laszlo), Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman the ingenious screen writing of the Epsteins and Koch cannot be overlooked. To write a screenplay that embodies the beautiful complexities of love and the heinous complexities of WW2 politics is truly a feat of artistic genius displayed by the Epstein's and Koch. As the old saying goes, they don't make movies like this anymore.Unfortunately time portals are not yet a reality but a movie theater is a great place to escape to another time, especially if you are seeing a classic like Casablanca. For those of you who have not seen Casablanca on the big screen please do not miss the next chance you have to do so. Here's to Casablanca being played again Sam.Like what you see here?

269,minister_of_silly_walks,Rightfully one of the best,10,18 March 2019,"Considered the best movie of all time by many and they have a valid case. ""Casablanca"" hits all the notes of the classical Old Hollywood blockbuster to a par and then some! It has a gripping story paced to perfection with all the elements you could ask for drama, suspense, romance, espionage all centered around our two protagonists who tried to find their place in a world dominated by conflict, war and lacking any sentimentalism.",Casablanca
270,thedarkhorizon,"Classic, beautiful, light hearted - how does a ""all time classic really feel like""?",7,21 November 2019,"In regards to user ""JAYMAY"" and the wonderful review ""HOW TO WATCH THIS MOVIE"": Thank you, kiddo.It came over me some months ago... like ""damn, I have never seen it. Just have a vague idea what it is REALLY about... but so what. Is it romance or a war movie? Dunno. I'm going to watch it now. Let's dive.""
And that was the best decision on how to approach that movie - without expectations. Yes, it is a super hyped classical Hollywood block buster. Yes, it is a great love story, so great, it sounds so unreal when you read about it. It is replayed over and over in TV at peak times (like Christmas?). Yes, it is over 60 years old, black and white and uses different cinematic styles than modern cinema.What compelled me in this movie is how truly timeless it is. The usage of lenses, blurry fuzzy filters (to make it look more glorious and romantic at times, esp. Bergmanns face), the play of light and shadow, camera movement bring out the pure emotions of the actors so, so well... I wouldn't have expected that!Timeless is, when the characters and the story feels real and 'possible' no matter the age or the black-white-colors or the different era. The dialogue is thoughtful, deep (and deserves a rewatch to truly appreciate it!) and the characters have these subtle, gentle movements and expressions that are salt and pepper to the story. The true intensity is written in their faces, like they were sitting across from us at a dinner table at candle light, re-telling their deepest, heart-felt memories.I was IN love with Richard (Bogart) when the camera zooms in on Ilsa (Bergmann) with the warm, fuzzy light and her glowing eyes - and I fell for Richard when he expressed his sometimes truly life-affirming, sometimes cynical ideas. It is melancholic, sentimental and yet full of life.Sure, it isn't a movie of 'our time', but it shows human nature and life, that is lived for centuries, no matter if it is in the 40s or today. It was a great journey into the past and ends with the present.I truly appreciate this movie, even if it is not my favorite movie of all times. That's ok. It is timeless - and THAT is the true mastery here for me.",Casablanca
271,cosmorados,Flawed Classic,8,27 May 2008,"Firstly the plot. The story of Rick, a man who is ravaged by despair and regret running a bar in Casablanca, a city run by occupied France. Enter a resistance hero, Victor Laszlo, needing two letters of transit to escape to America to carry out a propaganda war against the Nazi's after fighting and resisting them as they marched through Europe unopposed. As Rick winds up with the letters and has fought for noble causes in the past it should be relatively easy to get out for the hero. But as the resistance fighter's escort is Rick's long lost love, Ilsa Lund, nothing is going to go smoothly. Let's get one thing straight about this film, while the plot is fantastic, The cast do make it better. If you take some of the moments of bad dialogue in this movie and look at it on face value, then what you've got on paper is a contender for one of the hammiest films of all time, and sadly Ingrid Bergman gets landed with all of the crap lines.However, the classic moments thankfully outweigh the bad ones, Peter Lorry and Bogies chat at the chess table and subsequent arrest ""I stick my neck out for nobody"" the superb moment with Captain Renault as Rick looks after the plane leaving with longing etched into every line on his face, the incredible scene at the roulette table which makes my stomach do somersaults every time I see it ""Have you tried 22?"" and my personal favourite, the underrated Victor Laszlo's impassive response when informed that the man that would save him and Ilsa has been killed in custody ""Is that all?"" is a great response when you consider what he has just heard.Overall, for me, this is not in the league of ""The Big Sleep"" which matches Casablanca for classic moments and arguably has the better lines, but it still does not take away the fact that this is a classic, albeit a flawed one.",Casablanca
272,f-57307,classic movie,8,1 April 2020,"""There are so many cities and towns in the world, and there are so many pubs in the city, but she walked into mine."" A few years later, I had already felt a lot less moved, but those lines were still classic. I always remember that beautiful ""As Time Goes By"", and I also remember that Ingrid Bergman has such a pair of charming eyes, even the black and white film can't hide the unique brightness.",Casablanca
273,ScottAmundsen,"Play the ""Marseillaise.""... Play it!",10,16 February 2012,"Some films are greater than the sum of their parts. According to Hollywood lore, no one who was involved in the making of CASABLANCA, one of the most iconic of American films, had the slightest idea that they were making anything more than a run-of-the-mill programmer. True, it was an A-list programmer, with A-list stars, an A-list director, and the kind of ensemble of well-known and beloved character actors filling out the supporting cast that Warner Bros fans had come to love and expect. Yet despite all this, for most of the personnel involved it was business as usual; Ingrid Bergman remarked in her autobiography that the script was being written as they went along, and it was not until late in the shooting schedule that she finally knew who she would end up with, which she claimed made it confusing because she did not know from one day to another who she was supposed to be in love with.Seventy years later, it seems remarkable to think that the people making this stunning film didn't realize what they had. For the finished product is one of those films that approaches perfection in the same way GONE WITH THE WIND and CITIZEN KANE did.By now, I think everyone knows the bare bones of the story, which revolves around Rick's Café Américain, a nightclub and (illicit) casino in unoccupied French Morocco run by Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) and involves the efforts of people trying to get exit visas to go to Lisbon, and on to the United States.Casablanca is still unoccupied, but that does not mean the Nazis are not milling around, most notably one Major Heinrich Strasser (Conrad Veidt in his final film). And they are most interested in one recent arrival: resistance fighter Victor Laszlo, an escapee from a concentration camp hoping to get out of Casablanca one step ahead of the Nazis. Traveling with him is Miss Ilsa Lund (Bergman), whom we later discover is Laszlo's wife and who was briefly Rick's lover in Paris when she thought her husband was dead.I don't really need to describe it any more. This is one of those films that is simply a joy to watch no matter how many times one sees it: it is beautifully shot in crisp black-and white, Michael Curtiz's direction is, as always, impeccable, and the only way to describe the cast is ""heaven sent;"" everyone fits their roles so perfectly that the movie soars like the airplane to Lisbon that represents escape from terror and freedom in the New World.Bogart and Henreid have seldom been better; Bogart did not often get to show his softer side, but when he did, he showed what a great actor he really was. Henreid plays a man who is a legend throughout Europe, but he makes him completely human. And Bergman is sublime as always; her performance turned out to be pitch-perfect, and I can't decide between this film and NOTORIOUS, but she has seldom been more beautiful than she is here.Surprisingly, this film does not seem to date. It is as fresh to me today as it was when I first saw it on the Late Show about forty years ago. I guess the greatest works of art are truly eternal.",Casablanca

275,Kakueke,Superb All the Way,10,4 August 2001,"Few people need an introduction to this movie, altho there is always a first time for everyone.  But also for those who have seen it already, I wish to share a few thoughts.  My favorite scene is the singing of La Marseilles; remember, this is a movie about passion and good and evil, altho the ending and many other scenes are also great.  I also find it interesting that this was a play before, and many did not think it as effective as a play, but it worked so well as a movie.  The backdrop and the skills of film makers can add a lot (and the acting).  But although Ingrid Bergman fit in well here, I thought that the acting jobs by Bogart and others, purely in terms of being convincing, were better.  Excellent scenery, elegant French culture, so well scripted, and idealistic.  Yet altho Rick changed at the end, his person throughout the bulk of the movie allows a good outlet for people feeling life's frustrations.  But even for those, it is rousing to have the good ending, isn't it?",Casablanca
276,theognis-80821,Masterpiece,10,13 March 2021,"A great movie, perfect in its dialogue, staging, casting, performance, and scoring, with a well-structured script that veers deftly between sentiment and logic. To say that the Oscar-winning script is brilliant is to underestimate it. The dramatic camera movements of Michael Curtiz are never put to better use than they are here. I'm very concerned however by the remarks of Ben Mankiewicz and Eddie Muller, which may heard by young people watching this movie on TCM in the future and which may color their appraisals: the Letters of Transit are important. Nazi Germany did not exist in a vacuum. As historian Richard Overy, among others, has pointed out, the outcome of the war was not a certainty when this picture was made. Germany had important allies (Italy and Japan) and friends (Rumania, Spain, Portugal, and official France). Certainly, Hitler violated major agreements with Chamberlain and Molotov, but Germany could not casually violate ALL agreements with ALL countries ALL the time. It would be more important to respect Vichy than to keep Victor Laszlo in Casablanca. (Throughout, Conrad Veidt turns to Claude Rains for affirmation.) Mankiewicz and Muller make a living by talking and seem inclined to give more credit to the oratory of Victor Laszlo than it deserves. Wars are not won by oratory, but by logistics. The war was not won by inspiring words from FDR and Churchill or by the Resistance; it was won by the lives of tens of millions of people, nearly all Soviets, whose sentiments may have been articulated by Laszlo, but whether or not he escapes Casablanca is not determinative of anything. ""Casablanca"" is a good example of realism.",Casablanca
277,pswanson00,top 5,10,26 March 2005,"I didn't see Casablanca all the way through until I was in my late 20's, and I'm glad. I wouldn't have appreciated the truth behind the actions and relationships of the characters at an earlier age. This is one of the world's great films.I remember one television viewing especially. I had returned home from seeing a movie which was so poor that I have no recollection as to what film it was. I got home just as Casablanca was starting, and -- in spite of, or maybe beCAUSE of having already seen a movie that day -- sat mesmerized through the entire film. When it was over I looked at my wife and said ""Do you think the guy who made that piece of crap we saw earlier has ever even SEEN a good movie?"" I suspect that some young film makers have not. Casablanca has, besides one of the great casts in film history: sharp, smartly paced dialogue; layers of true- to-life stories; superb black-and-white photography. Anyone who has ever lost at love will ache as the characters wrestle with life-affecting decisions which wrench the heart. This is a great film.",Casablanca
278,Kubris,A classic of classics,9,5 June 2011,"Well, after sitting on my shelf for years, I finally watched Casablanca. As a young movie viewer, I have little experience with black-and-white films, so I was a little unprepared for what would happen next.Casablanca is a Rom-dram set in Africa during World War II. It was also made during World War II, during a period of heavy fighting. Nowadays, it's like a time capsule from the most violent period in modern history. But enough with the history, and on with the film.The first half hour was very faced paced, plot wise. Lots happened quickly, demanding your full attention. A viewer has to pay very close attention to figure out what's happening. However, it does slow down into a more gently paced movie. I'm not sure if that happens with all old movies, but very rarely nowadays will so much happen at the beginning of a film.The acting is great. Rick's presence on screen is felt by all, Humphrey Bogart did an unrepeatable job as the stern yet sentimental hero. Everyone else plays their roles well, but it was hard for me to really tell what is and isn't good because acting has changed over the years. It seems that old movies have very dialogue-based acting, whereas new movies have action-based acting.Speaking of dialogue, it becomes very apparent that Casablanca's is special. There's a reason it has the most number of famous lines on AFI's 100 lines list. But that's all I can say about that.Lastly, the plot. *No spoilers* After the first 25 minutes, the plot becomes coherent and the story is very enjoyable. The pacing is very good, so the film never drags. The ending is very nice, and the buildup to it has several twists, some you will see coming, others you won't.Ultimately, Casablanca is a classic film any cinema aficionado should see. 8.8/10",Casablanca

That's no small feat, but by no means an understatement for this film.Directed by the legendary Michael Curtiz and starring Hollywood names such as Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, it tells an initially slow paced film noir-style story. Beaitufully shot, acted and written.Beyond its cynical tone however beats a positive heart that ultimately breaks through in the end, ending a tragic yet beautiful love story in a bittersweet way.Overall, it's pretty much a perfect movie by every means and one that should be ""play (ed) again"" whenever there's a chance!",Casablanca
281,hbs,"wonderful ""golden-age"" movie",9,12 September 2000,"This is a perfect example of the golden-age of Hollywood.

283,Arkaan,The classic,10,30 September 1999,"This movie defines classic cinema.  It has romance, intrigue, comedy, everything.  It has become so entrenched in today's society, that it's surprising to think that this film was just considered another film when first released.  Humphrey Bogart truly gives his best performance ever.  Ingird Bergman is stunning and gorgeous, and Paul Henried is very suave and sophisticated (I wonder if he worked with Hitchcock.)  Claude Rains is at his best.  He was probably the greatest character actor ever.  While not technically brilliant, is it rock solid (with the exception of the train scene.  The rain is everywhere, and when they-Rick and Sam, walk on the train, everything is all of the sudden dry.)  It's interesting the sides taken for or against this film.

I love everything about this film, this film which defines classic and is everything a movie should be.",Casablanca
284,StevenKeys,Casablanca,3,24 February 2020,"Effusive praise creates its own legend.A 2d-rate melodrama that's been highly-hyped since it premiered in November 1942 (L.A.), less than two months prior to and in promotion of the first-rate Allied powers conference held in Casablanca, Morocco in January 1943 (unconditional surrender decree), then in national release one day prior to the meeting's end (1.23.43). Now how's that for a go-getter PR department? Yet, it is the perfect Classic for the new millennium as its greatness lies not in its story or substance but still sizable celebrity.To the film's war image, that Blaine, written as a former freedom-fighter (Spain) and gun-runner (Ethiopia), has decided to sit out the Big One (WW2) is hard to figure. Just as hard to appreciate is Rick's chummy relationship with the local Vichy authority in Renault (Rains), a position which in any reality would've had the prefect putting countless Allies and innocents into the clutches of the SS (Veidt), but has now decided to risk it all for his Yankee pal on a spontaneous infusion of conscience? C'mon.And not only is this a bad war film, it's a bad romance, to boot. To think Ilsa (Ingrid) would even consider leaving her husband Victor (Henreid), the tall, handsome, brave Czech Allied operative for the older, bow-tie wearing, bar-owner Rick (Bogart), hits the height of implausibility, though, Laszlo may run short himself in the smarts department, leading an oddly-timed rendition of La Marseillaise in the Cafe, even as he tries to stay one step ahead of the Nazi thugs. But that Lund does flirt with infidelity in such circumstance makes a mockery of any claim at sentiment and romantic worth.More disappointing than the story and script (Renault: ""I'm shocked, shocked to find there's gambling going on in here!"") (oy), is that I admire so many of the artists involved in the cooking of this over-baked ham. A cavalcade of Classic greats in leads Bogart (The-Haves African-Queen), Bergman (Gaslight) and Henreid (Now-Voyager), support in Veidt (Dark-Journey), Rains (Invisible-Man Lawrence), Lorre (M), Qualen (Grapes), Greenstreet (Maltese-Falcon), Sakall (Yankee-Doodle Summertime), Dalio (La-Grande-Illusion), Dantine, Page, LeBeau, Steiner, Wallis produced and director Curtiz who developed so many stars in films like Noahs-Ark The-Adventures-Of-Robin-Hood Mildred-Pierce Yankee-Doodle-Dandy The-Breaking-Point Trouble-Along-the-Way, just to name a few. Under-utilization of great talent was never so apparent.The clincher: Had Woody Allen not revived interest in the film on Play-It-Again-Sam (72), it may've settled into a more fitting state. According to TCM host Robert Osborne, two of its three leads in Henreid and Bergman, both who'd out-lived co-star Bogart (d.57) and were afforded time for reflection, had expressed ""surprise"" at the great acclaim that continued to heap upon the picture. Like Meatloaf sang, ""two outta' three ain't bad,"" but this movie surely is .. bad, haughty AFI rank notwithstanding (1/4).",Casablanca
285,jmworacle-99025,Timeless,10,25 May 2020,"I just watch this movie on TCM again. Ben Mankiewicz was dscussing some behind the scenes information. My favorite scene was the cafe scene where when the Germans and French were dueling over their songs. Many of the actors had fled the Nazi terror ad the tears in their eyes were genuine.

""Play it again, Sam.""Casablanca has taken such an elevated place in pop culture, its images and quotes (like the ones above) seeped into so many TV shows and movies to follow it, that when you actually get around to watching it it can seem a little underwhelming. Bogart and Bergman are Bogart and Bergman of course, and can charm the pants off anyone living or dead, but there's a lot of melodrama and a distinctly saggy middle. By the halfway point you might even be ready to write this off as one of those films that's important but not necessarily a great watch for a modern audience.And then comes in the third act, a powerful and blisteringly-paced series of climaxes, and all of your earlier skepticism was wiped away and you're rooting wholeheartedly for Rick and Ilsa and their doomed romance. Or at least I was. What sets Casablanca apart from so many of its contemporaries is its ambiguous morality -- not the universal cynicism of most noir movies but a mature perspective that can see good in evil as well as vice versa. Most importantly, it juxtaposes what we want as viewers and what's actually the right thing to do in a way few movies do.In short, even if you've received most of the plot and scenes through cultural osmosis, Casablanca is still worth watching, if only for that heart-wrenching climax.",Casablanca

It's not a bad movie by any stretch; it's just a rather pedestrian one if you ask me.When I first saw ""Casablanca"", the opening minutes felt bizarre and had me wondering if I was watching the right movie. Ingrid Bergman's enchanting performance is probably the best thing in the entire film, although the Ilsa Lund character is hardly one of her best roles.

The story, of love found and lost and then found again, of choosing principle over expediency, of deciding what really matters, is timeless. The performances are top notch, aided by the fact that many of the actors were actual refugees from the Nazis. I think of the look of hatred and pain on Bogart's face when he sees Ilsa again for the first time, of his look of loss at the train station, of his look of nobility when he tells her that the ""good fight"" is worth what they have to give up as he says ""here's looking at you, kid"". A bittersweet romantic outcome for the ages. I think of how luminous Ingrid looks, and how expressive her eyes are as she experiences love, pain, sorrow, joy, and regret. Great, crackling dialogue. It amazes me that the script was essentially written on the fly, and they didn't even decide until late how it would all turn out. One of the all time great films.",Casablanca

I've seen it no less than one dozen times and each viewing has a bit more than the last.Simply impossible to believe that during the making of it,the original writers, the Epstein Brothers, walked out in disgust and in came Howard Koch, the author of the famous 1938 Mercury Theater Orson Welles's ""War of the Worlds"" based on H.G.'s masterpiece. That's right-the Epsteins said the film was going nowhere-they took a hike and Bogey and Koch sat down and together completed the script. Even Ingrid Bergman, after shooting was done, said she never wanted to be associated with such garbage again. Oh heck, I could write a million words of praise about ""Casablanca"" but never could I impart the true greatness of the film. It's got to be seen to be believed. The whole darn thing is engrossing, enchanting, mesmerizing,tough,tender,stirring,nationalistic,anti-Nazi and that's only the beginning. ""As Time Goes By"" is not only one of America's greatest love songs but just about the one song most closely associated with any film. Dooley Wilson looks like he's playing it but the truth is that the man didn't know how to play the piano. But who cares,Miss Ilsa? Want to know how good is that picture? Ever hear of anyone buying and devouring three books about it? I did. (1)""Casablanca"" by Richard Anobile,(2) ""Casablanca"" by Howard Koch and (3)the most definitive work ever written about the film,the 402 page tome,""Round Up the Usual Suspects"" by Aljean Harmetz which I read twice.

The famous saloon, where international bravado rules and exit visas are rampantly desired.This is undoubtedly the funniest and most cynical of Bogart's characters and Bergman is an absolute stunner.  My favorite shot in the film is that of Bergman as she looks out of the corner of her eye for Rick as Laszlo goes to the bar.

As if this was a strange and odd way to see a movie.  All I can say is maybe they don't know anything about American culture.  Does ""I don't do black and white"" mean that ""I am an idiot"".  I don't know.  But what I do know is that this movie is a true American work of art.  One of the best indications of what we as Americans have given to the rest of the world. When non-Americans say that we as a nation have nothing in the way of culture, let them see this movie and tell me that Americans don't have culture.

That alone should tell you about the best ever picture - dialogue plus acting and action carrying the movie along without cursing, without car chases, without nudity and sex & love & passion hinted at, but never rubbed in your face... Classy in a class of its own!The snivelling Peter Lorre; the would-be bullying of Sidney Greenstreet; Ingrid and Bogey - each reluctant heroes on opposite sides of the heart juxtaposed with the near clueless nobility of the Viktor Laszlo character...
All the while the snide private observances of Claude Rains observing without being observed and a reluctant champion in private, at that!Woman needs man, and man!

Humphrey Bogart just breezed through his lines like he was Rick himself. Every time he utters a word it comes out like silk and Ingrid Bergman is the best example of a true Hollywood actress no matter what time frame you're looking act. Peter Lorre is one of my favorites (especially after seeing him in this and ""M""), and his expressions in this, both verbal and facial were incredible. This is just a timeless masterpiece that is great to be able to watch on a nice relaxing day and see first hand that film can be one of the most beautiful forms of art when done correctly. It doesn't get much better than this, and even that's arguable to some I presume. I wish there were more movies like this but I'm sure that's easier said then done since it'd be next to impossible to pop out scripts like this. Oh well, one can wish right? If you haven't seen this yet then stop what you're doing immediately and rush out to the video store, it is of the utmost importance...I kid you not!!!Final 2 Cents:Movies : This must've been a gem on the screen.DVD Purchase : A necessity, now I just got to trade it in for the special edition.Rental : Absolutely imperative!",Casablanca

Bogart and Bergman are wonderful together, with marvelous chemistry and sexual tension.  However, both stand on their own two feet very well, and give excellent performances.  Claude Rains is also quite good as the police cheif who is the recipeint of the famous line, ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"".  Which brings us to the glorious dialogue that deserves to be quoted (and undoubtedly will be) until the end of time.  While overly melo-dramatic at times, the film never loses its power and we can always identify with the characters.  Thank God this is one of the better-looking films of its era; most others have only survived in fading prints with muddy sound and fuzzy pictures, but this has always been kept in top-notch condition, to be enjoyed endlessly.

The dialogue makes up probably the most iconic, quotable screenplay of all time, even topping the Princess Bride. (Maybe). The plot is smoothly paced and has been riffed on ever since.

There isn't one bad performance on screen here, and most are brilliant.  Rick, maybe the original anti-hero, played by Bogart at his best.  Claude Rains as the wisecracking, corrupt, and ultimately decent Vichy police captain.  Paul Henreid as Lazlo, urbane, quiet, and unflinching.  And of course, Ingrid Bergman, Ingrid Bergman, Ingrid Bergman.Two best scenes in the movie (getting goosebumps just remembering them): ""Le Marseillaise"" in the club, and Louis tossing the bottle of Vichy water in the wastebasket.

But I do",10,11 December 2000,"I was raised like every other Generation Xer: on explosions, sex, fighting, swearing, and car chases.  After being terribly dissapointed with Citenzen Kane, I was worried whether or not I would like Casablanca.  So I never rented it.  On day I saw The Maltese Falcon on The Movie Channel, and, low and behold, I liked it.  In fact, I loved it.  It was on of the best movies I've ever seen.  So, I decided to give Casablanca a shot.This has become one of my favorite movies ever.  I'm not supposed to like it.  I'm a rock n' roll generation guy raised on Indiana Jones and Jerry Brockheimer.  But, I liked it.  I loved it.  It had something no movie today has, taste.I'm an expert of modern film.  I've seen almost everything made from 1980 to today.  Recently, I've started to see more 70's movies.  Then I jumped back to the 40's with Casablanca.  Man, this movie is so good.I honestly can't think of the reasons why this movie is so good.  It defies reason.  The acting is great.  I really mean that.  I've never seen acting this good, it just doesn't exsist anymore.  The story is great.  This is one of the only romantic movies I've ever seen that I think both guys and women can like.  Mainly because the romance, while it is at the heart of the story, is not the ONLY focus of the film.Seriously, how can you possibly not like this movie.  How I ask?  You can't, that's how.  If you haven't seen the movie, see it, because you're robbing yourself of something great.  Even if you're in college, or high school, even if you were breed on perverted movies with blood, guts, and fart jokes, see this movie, or you have no right to call yourself a ""movie goer"".

308,commandercool88,A sweeping romance for the ages.,10,7 July 2008,"From its opening scene, it isn't difficult to see there's something special about 'Casablanca'. The feeling that this is how movies are meant to be made. And from beginning to end, this is an epic romance for the ages. A timeless and gripping picture, it still resonates more than 65 years after its release. Anything you could ever ask for in a motion picture, 'Casablanca' has it and plenty more.The simple and subtle beauty of 'Casablanca' is mystifying. The romance. The intrigue. The cool sleight of hand. Few films have been able to manage such massive and broad appeal. It is a picture of the utmost mastery. Pick it apart, every scene and every line of rich dialogue, or simply allow yourself to be swept away by its mesmerizing story of love and enduring hope. It is without a doubt a cornerstone of Hollywood cinema, a film that forever raised the bar.Let us say that a moment is never wasted with the fantastic on-screen talents. The performances are pitch perfect, from the film's headlining stars to small supporting appearances. The legendary Humphrey Bogart plays his cards so incredibly well, every line of dialogue delivered with such subtlety but undeniable authority. Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, and Claude Rains all deliver superb and notable performances, and after so much that has been written about them, you just have to sit back and admire the golden memories these individuals make on-screen together.Whether it be its terrific performances, a beautiful score, flawless direction, or sweeping cinematography, 'Casablanca' never misses a beat and never disappoints. A classic story of love with the perils of war and politics acting as the key antagonists, there are too many unforgettable moments to count on one hand. The classic 'battle of the bands' between the French and Germans will forever live on as a truly hair-raising and defining scene not only for 'Casablanca' but the entire scope of film. And with one of the most recognizable and memorable endings in history, we will always have 'Casablanca'.'Casablanca' is a masterful work that lives on today stronger than ever. It's a classic, and rightfully resides amongst the best films ever put to screen. Vintage Hollywood, the way it ought to be remembered. It's true that they just don't make films today the way they used to. And as I continue to make my way through the classics of years gone by, I remember to savor every moment of it.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",Casablanca

310,flickershows,This Classic Is Beloved (Especially By The AFI),9,20 November 2013,"Casablanca---the beloved classic of love, sacrifice and usual-suspect roundups---is 71 years old. The movie could've started earning a pension 6 years ago, yet it endures. Somehow this picture never gets old. I think one big reason is its sense of humour about an ultra-sensitive situation. For all the Nazis and the talk of concentration camps, there's Claude Rains cracking wise with Humphrey Bogart. People love Bogie and Ingrid Bergman in Casablanca, but the real romance is between Rick and Louis. Beautiful friendship? Get a room with Renault's casino winnings, you two!We all know the great lines of dialogue, but did you know the American Film Institute honoured six (6!) of those classic lines on their Top 100 Quotes list in 2005? They had so many that the AFI couldn't even cram the ""hill of beans"" or ""shocked, shocked to find illegal gambling"" lines onto the Top 100. Even if you don't know much about Casablanca, you've heard 2 or 3 of the legendary quotes. That's not even taking into account how the AFI ranks ""As Time Goes By"" as the 2nd best movie song ever and the movie itself as the #1 romantic flick.But this picture is so much more than high rankings on Top 100 lists and witty bon mots. You've got tension, drama, romance, witticisms, love songs, duelling national anthems, flashbacks, drinking, rigged gambling, and Nazi death. Good ol' Morocco. You know how to show a girl and a guy a good time...before they walk off with other people.

There's not just one thing that's great about this movie; each part is so integral to this film that it would be impossible to imagine anything altered in the slightest.  This is the best film that I've seen Bogart in, and his sarcastic, no-nonsense attitude makes him the perfect ""anti-hero"": A man who seems cynical to the world, yet risks it all to do what he believes is right.  This was a very ""noble"" film in its principles.There are very few films that I'll give a ""10"" on the rating system.  This was a no-brainer for me.

First stop Casablanca. What first struck me about Casablanca was the script, sharp and witty at times and include more classic lines that you could erm... well lots of classic lines. Yes many lines from this film have been said time and time again and are part of our culture now. The final lines Bogie utters to the lovely Ingrid Bergman before she leaves I had heard before and I hadn't seen the film! Next Humphrey Bogart. He's a really cool guy and his performance in this movie is pitch perfect I aim to watch some more of this mans movies. Casablanca surprised me I must admit. The ending is brave indeed and contributes to its legendary status of that I have no doubt. Any ending where the lead doesn't get the girl, where the love rival is as brave if not braver just adds layers to an already great story with such a crackling script. Its hard to recommend this film as many sadly would not get over its age.

In this way, the scope and scale of Casablanca is really enviable for other movie makers of the time.But, above all, exists the towering, dashing, bold, upright and magnanimous figurehead presence of Humphery Bogart as Rick. Rick is the one single ingredient in the film, which is the pivot of all the riveting poignant drama that is superbly played by Bogart. Besides, the script and screen writing is marvelous for those early times of motion picture industry.

326,parhat,Looks like the story was written by a six year old,1,6 April 2005,"The movie is predictable, the lines are predictable, Bogart chain smokes all the time. The ending is predictable. The acting is stiffed. People watching the plane flying over looks like they were acting.I went to comatose over 10 times. Rewatched it by hanging myself upside down with my pet bat and still couldn't feel anything for the movie. I was again forced fed to watch to understand why these monkey brained movie critics liked about the movie and I still couldn't stand it. It is obvious that Ingrid Bergman is running away, and why is it that Bogart don't get a bit suspicious? He could get suspicious and just still like the woman with a double feelings for her by reminiscing that incidence.Oh yeah bitter Bogart, and yeah cynical Bogart became idealistic in the end. And good friend the stupid cop also decides to become idealistic also, but what are the mathematical odds against this scenario? But isn't that stupid? Isn't the ending a bit messy for Bogart and the cop just for just silly women? I mean the ending is so predictable and I guessed the ending of the movie since the beginning of the romance, breakup and welcome back and another (I will not mention the ending)... but you could have guessed.Couldn't the ending be like this: Bogart doesn't even have to sell his entire business - he can just get a partnership and still retain the interests, and what happened to poor Sam the piano player - throw away an old pal and cop and Bogart become fugitive? No way! Even in real life, it would be fair to say that if I were Bogart, I would dump the woman anyway since she had a previous boyfriend. It just not credible. And what to do if Bogart shot the police who tries to inform the authorities? Simple just pay your local cop under the table and it's business as usual.Do you really need to sell the ownership of Cafe Americain? That would be a stupid idea. Even if Bogart was under house arrest, he can still escape and yet still maintain his control through his old pal the Piano player Sam and if that's not possible just get another partnership to run the show. He can also retain control by through his banks and his check signing, etc. without having to be physically present at Cafe Americain.Again poor choices of Bogart a cynical man should have some business shrewdness like him should have been a bit more practical in his business affair without having to sacrifice any idealism for love, romance or anything else that comes his way.Is there other ways to NOT SELL Bogart business? Yes there are other ways. You can lease the business on a 10 year basis with furniture, equipment, Sam the piano player etc. and once the lease is over, he can get the ownership back. Or how about another idea, franchising? Just franchise Cafe Americain to your competitors and collect royalties. I mean there are a lot of ways out here, but no one who watches the movie tries to imagine the best way out for these poor creatures (Bogart, cop and Sam). The cop in the end of the story is very unlikely to run away, but he can be just part of the cover-up. In fact there weren't any witness anyway. And why would he do the cover-up? Simple: he also gets the commissions from the Roulette wheel.Because of the messy ending and see-sawing of story, I can see clearly that the writers were a bit messy and undecided and therefore decide to put every trash into the movie and crossed their fingers, while making sure the main point of the ""fair ending"" is o.k. but did not clear all the loose ends.So much for a story that is poorly written! Get real. The story is not even close to realism!",Casablanca
327,Danimal-7,"For all-around entertainment, the best I've ever seen",10,27 August 1999,"CASABLANCA is the best treatment ever of the ancient theme of the love triangle.  Set in World War II Casablanca, a Moroccan city under the control of the collaborationist Vichy French government, the movie starts with a news wire that two German couriers have been murdered and their letters of transit stolen.  Each letter will permit one person to leave Casablanca to a neutral country.Enter Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine, owner of the shady but cheerful Cafe Americaine.  Rick is a cynical and hard-nosed man whose motto is, ""I stick my neck out for nobody.""  Like many a cynic, Rick is an embittered ex-idealist, still nursing his wounds from being abandoned by his lover Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman).  By chance he falls into possession of the missing letters of transit.Enter Ilsa, who comes to Casablanca on the arm of Czech Resistance leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), a few steps ahead of the Nazi police.  We now have three people and two letters of transit.  Who will reach America, and who will stay in Casablanca?I know no other movie that so perfectly balances humor, romance, and drama. The soul of good drama lies in presenting characters with hard choices, and few choices are as hard, or as illuminating of the protagonists' makeup, as the choices in CASABLANCA.  All of the characters must decide what they will give up for love, for honor, and for themselves.  The scenes of Rick and Ilsa's love, years ago in Paris, are some of the finest romantic scenes in cinema.  And the humor, particularly in the person of Casablanca's Prefect of Police, Louis Renault, has contributed dozens of dry witticisms to our everyday language - ""I am shocked! Shocked! - ""The Germans wore gray, you wore blue."" - ""I was misinformed."" - ""It would take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca, and the Germans have outlawed miracles.""  So perfectly blended are these three major elements that you cannot point to a single shot or scene that should have been eliminated from the movie.  Never try to watch only one scene from CASABLANCA; you will inevitably be absorbed until the very end of the film.  It is little short of miraculous that the chaotically mismanaged shooting of this movie resulted in such a magnificent final product; it speaks volumes for luck and for Owen Marks' and Michael Curtiz' post-production editing.I have never encountered a movie whose supporting cast was so perfectly realized.  Every minor character is a fleshed-out, realistic individual, from Sasha to Carl the headwaiter to Rick's competitor Ferrari to the self-effacing criminal Ugarte.  Claude Rains' Captain Renault (""I'm only a poor corrupt official"") steals scene after scene, and Dooley Wilson's Sam is a refreshingly loyal, charismatic and sympathetic conception from an era when almost all black characters were rendered as demeaning stereotypes. The only character who tastes of the cliche is the villainous Major Strasser, which can be forgiven in a wartime production.The only film I have ever seen as tautly effective as CASABLANCA is GLORY. Although the 54th Mass.'s story is arguably superior even to CASABLANCA for sheer dramatic power and acting talent, GLORY lacks CASABLANCA's wonderful humor and romance, which causes me to give the edge to Curtiz' classic as the better-rounded movie.  I have yet to see CASABLANCA surpassed.Rating: **** out of ****.",Casablanca
328,victor7754,It's all in the script!Flawless.,10,12 June 2004,"Casablanca's formula is superb. The script contains all the elements of classical cinema with a wonderful array of characters blending in politics, passion, romance, war, self sacrifice, nationality, heroism, mystery, love, friendship, intrigue, patriotism....The characters are carefully thought out. It takes a masterful writer to define a character with few words. Rick of course has the best definition of humanity. We learn by him saying ""I stick my neck out for nobody"" that he is out for number one but then we learn he is a softy when he hears reason within and calls on the number ""22"" to aid a poor refugee and his wife. The screenwriters have a great time with this man and Humphrey Bogart played it flawlessly.It is Elsa whom is the truest of hustlers. She knows how to use her abilities as a beautiful woman to gain power but for the good side. Her character appears vulnerable and soft but cleverly disguised it is she who truly saves the day. Ingrid Bergman is radiant!Claude Rains was given great dialogue and Peter Lorre is the perfect sleaze.Filled with music and song that give the drama it's life.A marvelous production design and beautiful black and white photography accompany an incredible cast. The film is perfect. One of the great film romances of our time. Everyone is a romantic during war. It must have lifted the spirit of millions during a horrific time. Classy and sophisticated.

This film is instructive in that it describes the tenseness of a world possibly about to lose its freedom to implacable conquerers.  This theme is as old as Athens and Sparta, which (thanks to public education) is just as unknown a story for many.  Against that background is a man (Rick) with a choice to make.

331,cordaro9418,"""... human life is cheap.""",10,1 June 2009,"Where to begin..? Originally believed a 'B' film in their product, Warner Bros. never conceived the effect the movie would have. Shot in sequence due to a script written daily, the actors never knew what to expect from the characters day after day. The fact that not even the writers knew who would win the girl till the night before the classic scene was shot. And yet 'Casablanca' is listed at No. 2 on the AFI top 100 films of all time (though should, in all actuality, be flip-flopped with 'Citizen Kane' for the top spot). With success in 'High Sierra' and 'The Maltese Falcon' (Thanks in large part to a rather ignorant George Raft) Bogart was well on his way to being a legitimate leading man. This film would make him a legend a studio star and later, a legend. Sure his body of work was the main factor, but 'Casablanca' in hand with 'Falcon' created the mystique of Bogart which films like 'To Have and Have Not' and 'The Big Sleep' only fueled. A mediocre effort from Warners which molded many of their castaway Euro-stars into a great and well written tapestry where everyone stole the scene from everyone else in such fashion it appeared seamless. The film moves along introducing us to each character in perfect detail, the harsh environment of Casablanca, that war-torn sweat-box which could easily double as a Tatooine spaceport from 'Star Wars', and the Nazi imperial rule who smothers them all. Never looked upon as epic and not even filmed as such 'Casablanca' exudes Epic film in a nice tidy package. With all around fantastic effort from everyone on screen with a great turn by Claude Raines the film is a must see and worthy of No. 2 on the list (sandwiched between 'Kane' and 'The Godfather'). Quickly paced and keeping you in your seat, get the popcorn and don't even think of going to the bathroom.",Casablanca
332,98nurdinm-1,"""You Must Remember This...""",8,14 February 2006,"""...a kiss is just a kiss, a siiiiigh is just a sigh...."" Ah, don't we just love ""Casablanca""? Is it not one of the best films of all time, perhaps even one of the greatest romances? The answer is, of course, yes. But why? Well, there are a number of factors to this. The first will be the story. ""Casablanca"" has a fantastic script, filled with intelligence and quick dry wit. It is genuinely surprising as well, at least the first time you watch it. The twists and turns that Humphrey Bogart's character Rick goes through keep us on the edge of our seat.The second factor to the greatness will be the backdrop. The war, although only serving as just a backdrop, plays an incredibly important part in the story. Some people might argue that Rick's involvement in the plot signal's the need for America to enter the war. It also gives us our villain - that of Strasser (Conrad Veidt), the Nazi General sent to arrest Laszlo (Paul Henreid). Although this no doubt dates the film a little, it still provides a fantastic atmosphere. Casablanca itself is a seedy world of scum and villainy (That sounds familiar...) and the many characters that inhabit it bring it to life vividly, from the pickpocket to the street seller.The characters are the third reason why ""Casablanca"" is remembered so well. Rick, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), and Laszlo get drawn into the love triangle easily. Bogart and Bergman are superb, as is Claude Rains as Louis Renault, the head of police there whose lines are great comic relief when we get into the nitty gritty of the romance.The one person we don't see enough of, I feel, is Sam (Dooley Wilson). For a character who seems to be regarded by Rick as a good friend, he disappears halfway through the film and is sold like slave labour along with the bar - one can only hope that he had a good rest of his life.The last and most important reason as to why this film is so good is the ending. It's one of the most famous endings of all time - it has a surprise twist, a wonderful score, and then tension builds up as Strasser arrives to stop the plane to Lisbon. The ending also supplies us with perhaps some of the most parodied lines in film history - I'll leave that up to you whether you think this is a good thing or not.By the way, although it is standard belief that no one ever says, ""Play it again, Sam"", I reckon that Rick does when he whispers to Sam the second time Ilsa and Laszlo arrive at the bar. I have a feeling Sam would know what he was on about somehow...8/10",Casablanca
333,stephenlovelette,Almost certainly still great.,9,30 June 2014,"It's up for debate whether or not this film holds up.If forced to pick a side, I say it does.The reason I can't commit to a hard and fast argument is because I've seen the film twice. Once in high school, six years ago.The second occasion is yesterday night at the Music Box Theater in Chicago. The print is being screened as a promotion for the upcoming Turner Classic Movie Festival.And the crowd is so eager to laugh at every minor joke, they completely overcompensate and ruin much of the movie.The uproarious laughter is loud enough it stifles half the dialogue, and serves as a constant reminder we're in a theater. There are some who will give pre-emptive laughs, chuckling during the buildup and destroying any comedic timing.I sure hope the devil reserves a special place in Hell for these people. But I guess I should talk about the movie at some point or another.Casablanca is very good, especially considering it's release in 1943.It is the epitome of a 'classic movie.' Yes, yes?Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and Claude Rains as Capt. Louis Renault steal the show in this film. It's a lot funnier than you might think.There are lovable and despicable characters (which is always helpful) and dare I say it, some heartwarming moments.In black and white! Can you believe it – kids in my Proverbial Audience?(I'm prolific in the single-digit demographic.)It's a film about cynicism and impression, and can be surprisingly upbeat. The narrative is truly exceptional, and the ending is more than satisfactory.This might be the most misquoted piece in history. Nobody ever says, ""Play it again, Sam.""I have no idea why that and, ""Badges? Badges? We don't need no stinking badges,"" from Blazing Saddles are so commonly misquoted. It's a rather strange phenomenon.For some odd reason I thought Victor Laszlo was an antagonist, but I sure was wrong on that one. The role's played by Paul Henreid, and he's rather excellent as well. Peter Lorre, too, as Ugarte, is pretty great.The hardest scene to swallow is his attempt to escape the police. The chase is a little silly.What is it about Humphrey Bogart? Soon as I hear that brusque tone, I think, ""Gee I like this fella.""Maybe it's him smoking that cigarette in the white jacket, or his ever-sustained calm.He's a great protagonist.

334,tyson-hunsaker,Rightfully one of cinema's finest stories ever told.,10,27 September 2017,"""Casablanca"" is a timely and timeless classic about a politically neutral saloon owner Rick in unoccupied France at a crossroads of destiny, conviction, and courage in his life. ""Casablanca"" is on the top of every film class's watchlist to study for just about every aspect of filmmaking imaginable. While the film's plot is air-shut tight and the characterization feels authentic over 70 years later, the main focus of ""Casablanca"" is idea focused. During a time of political neutrality, America was entering the war as was Rick, our hard-on-the-edges protagonist. This can be considered an ""enlist"" film to anyone on the fence. Because of it's conviction-driven focus on ideas and philosophy, and how grounded those struggles feel, ""Casablanca"" remains one of the most well regarded classics of all time. The struggles of Rick are applicable to anyone who watches the film, drawing on universal themes like conviction, courage, compassion, and love. The character of Rick is a fascinating one on an individual basis. We're set up to a character who's meticulous and thoughtful in the way he does things, paralleled by the chess game he has with no one. At the same time, we know of his loneliness without a partner to play with. We understand the respect he commands with patrons of the saloon yet the deep friendship he experiences with Sam. And while his corrupt inner shell shared with the chief is off-putting like a villain, we know he's ""...at heart, a sentimentalist"" when we learn of his passionate love for Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa. ""Casablanca"" also features some of cinema's most iconic and beautifully crafted cinematography by the great Arthur Edeson and of course the director, Michael Curtiz's masterful control of capturing the romantic moment. Not only on a story-telling, narrative perspective, ""Casablanca"" is worth studying for it's remarkable technical quality. While the film may be as close to perfect as one can get, some of the third act moments can feel unnatural and forced which could disorient some modern viewers. Nitpicking aside, ""Casablanca"" remains one of cinema's finest pieces of celluloid to date. Anyone looking for another round of film study or a clean dive into old classic films, this would be perfect to start with. It's rich in themes, characters, and intelligence.",Casablanca

It is an absolute classic of the noir era, due to how strong it is stylistically and has given us some of the most memorable lines and moments in film history. It can be easily interpreted as a propaganda film made to encourage the Americans to join the war. Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine is brilliant as the reluctant hero. The film itself has become iconic as a tale of redemption. Unlike Citizen Kane, it has withstood the test of time. In fact I would go further and say that Casablanca is timeless.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/IQ9T6J",Casablanca
340,gaityr,"A film for everyone, even 'As Time Goes By'...",9,15 August 2002,"How does one even begin to describe CASABLANCA? I know that there's nothing I can say to improve its reputation, or to make it any more well-loved. All I can attest to is the fact that I had the chance to see this film for the first time today, and just couldn't help falling in love with it. It's as close to perfect as a romance film could get, with elements of war, action, suspense, and good old-fashioned friendship thrown in to spice things up a little.(Summary contains spoilers, beware!) It's war-time, and Casablanca is en route to America and freedom. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), cynical and crusty owner of Cafe Americain, hides a softer, wounded side beneath his tough exterior. He says many times that he's never going to stick his neck out for anyone, that it's a policy of his not to drink with people in his cafe--all things that change when Isla (Ingrid Bergman) comes back into his life, unfortunately accompanied by her husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). Victor is a top man in the resistance movement, and needs desperately to escape to America to continue his fight for freedom. CASABLANCA isn't all about politics, however. It really comes down to the love of Rick for Ilsa, whom he met for a heady love affair in Paris, all set to the tune of 'As Time Goes By' (surely one of the most beautiful and memorable love songs ever written). His choice is the most difficult one anyone could ever be expected to make, and what's good about the film is that it keeps the audience guessing, even to the end, about just what Rick will do with the power he has over the fate of Ilsa, and most importantly, Victor (and as the film would have us believe, the free world!). I dare your heart not to break when Rick tells Ilsa, as he so famously does, ""Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world."" And then one realises just what war can do to people, and what people can do in spite of war.It's a fantastic film to be discovering for the first time, since the directing, acting and script are all first-rate. Michael Curtiz pulls the entire film together beautifully, drawing an incredible performance from Humphrey Bogart (perhaps the only actor--aside from Spencer Tracy--who could come off as so apparently self-centred and cynical and yet reveal a believably vulnerable side) and capturing Ingrid Bergman in all her luminous beauty. The supporting cast is brilliant, especially Claude Rains as the parallel character to Bogart's Rick, Captain Louis Renault. He certainly rivals Bergman for screen-time, and justifiably gets the lion's share of the good lines. Moreover, the screenplay is one of the most oft-quoted ones ever written, and for good reason: you just don't get dialogue like this anymore, in any film, and it's a treat to be allowed to listen in on the lives of these characters. CASABLANCA is often described as one of the best films ever made as well as one of the best-loved. Its reputation is fully deserved. Watch this for yourself to find out why!",Casablanca
341,punctate,2. Casablanca (1942),10,23 November 1998,"It is considered the second greatest American movie of all time and I can see why. Casablanca is a well-directed and acted adaptation of a play.

A women who he fell in love with comes to Casablanca and enters his bar which has him feeling upset. She had ditched him in France and he end up traveling with Sam the Piano Player. The movie portrays the Nazi's and the people who work for them in an interesting way. Ilsa Lund Laszlo claims she loves Rick but she is devoted to the cause of her Husband Victor.

When the old love steps in (Bergmann), the cliché won't stop until the very end that is just too expected and pathetic. However, Humphrey will set the standards for the male cool behavior and some of the most memorable lines in the history of cinema will be delivered during the course of this spy and love story. Casablanca"" is a good movie, but not an excellent one as the majority of ratings and reviews claim to.",Casablanca
345,Primtime,One of the all-time best,9,14 November 1998,"After a long time waiting, I finally sat down and made the time to watch Casablanca. Always hearing about the greatness of this film I knew that it had to be good, however, I still had my doubts. After all, Bogey playing a suave, yet hard-nosed romantic? After watching this film, all of my doubts were erased and I realized that this was one of the top films of all time.I find the fact that Casablanca was just another film (one of 50 films made by Warner Studios each year) amazing. The fact that the script of this film was made as the film was shot is also amazing considering that this is one of the greatest scripts ever written. For a romantic picture of the '40's this movie moves incredibly well. The war sub-plot of the film to me is what really kept the film moving at such a pace. Even though the film takes place over one day, the feeling of the war going on at the same time increases the sense of speed in the film. The war makes the flashback scene which also really completes the film. Perhaps some of the greatest film moments of all time occur in these short three minutes which contain more than most films do in two hours. The chemistry between Bogart and Bergman has such a presence in this film that makes the ending such a tragedy followed by such a redemption. Few films have neared the closeness of the two actors in this film. Throw in Paul Henried and his charming performance and you have a deadly love triangle that has been rarely surpassed. The song and score of this film are two more elements that make it so enchanting. The way that ""As time goes by"" is heard throughout the film gives it that haunting, yet subtle undertone that makes this movie so great. I feel that more than anything else, it was the music of this film that held everything together.Casablanca's cast of such variable characters has also been rarely if ever matched by another film. Three performances struck me in this film as being more than supporting characters, even though they were only supporting characters. Claude Rains as the Chief Renaud now ranks as one of my all-time favourites, Sydney Greenstreet as Ferrari has a short but poignant role, powerful enough to match up with Bogey and Dooley Wilson as Rick's best friend Sam plays another subtle, but powerful role. It is the personality mix of the characters that makes the film so overwhelming and interestingly enough, there is no true antagonist (Strasses comes close, yet still doesn't truly fulfill the role of the antagonist). The theme of lost love in this film is what made it so special for myself and many others.  However, the ending leaves the viewer with the feeling that what had happened was the right way to end the relationship, because after all ""they had Paris.""The values, themes and ideas of this film will always hold true for me and I am glad that after all I was able to see this great piece of filmmaking.9/10 stars.",Casablanca

Movie making has become much better in a lot of ways, especially when it comes to acting and over all cinematographic quality.As a 40+ years old man watching Casablanca for the first time in 2021, i honestly fail to understand what makes this movie so great. Is the acting good? For it's time maybe, but not today. The story is just another mediocre love story, common for it's time, and there isn't anything remarkable about the directing, the lighting, the script, the music, anything.So why are people giving Casablanca so high ratings? Is it the fact that you just have to love movies like this, because ""it's a classic""? Is it because of the godlike status of stars like Bergman and Bogart? Is it because of sentimental reasons? ...that your parents and grand parents loved it, so therefor we do?I'm sorry, but this is a rather boring movie where nothing really happens and people like me will probably be downvoted with the thought process of me ""not understanding it's greatness.""

During WW2 he ran clubs in neutral Lisbon. The club's were frequented by all sides and he became a spy for the allies. Evidently ,because he was Austrian and spoke seven languages he was able to pick,up a lot of chatter info once people had had a few too many drinks. After the war he came to America and managed The Colony Club in Palm Beach for many years.My wife was friendly with his daughter during that time.He had married an English spy-OSS - journalist in Lisbon.
As to the movie ,I had seen it years ago and didn't really remember it. The performances by Bogie, Bergman, and Claude Rains are top notch. The supporting cast is very strong. The story is quite romantic and has some definite emotional moments.The special effects look ancient ,because they are. The dialogue is pretty quipy and the comedy is there at times.

350,Tresix,THE Standard,10,29 September 2000,"I can honestly say I know what makes a good movie because I have a standard by which to compare it:  CASABLANCA.  Adapted from a play entitled ""Everyone Comes to Rick's"", CASABLANCA tells the story of American Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart in the role that made his legend), a cynical saloon owner. His motto:  ""I stick my neck out for nobody.  I'M the only cause worth fighting for.""  We learn that, in the past, Rick was once an idealistic man who would fight the good fight for just causes.  As his ""friend"" Louie (Claude Rains) reminds him as he ticks off the underdog causes that Rick has championed ""The winning side would have paid MUCH more.""  Just when we are convinced that Rick truly is an insular hard-case . . . into his life returns Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), the woman who killed the idealism in him.  She is on the arm of freedom fighter Victor Laslo (Paul Heinreid). The sight of Ilsa sparks a flashback that shows Rick, Ilsa and Rick's piano-playing friend Sam (Dooley Wilson) in Paris before the arrival of the Nazis.  As Rick and Sam wait for Ilsa, she sends him a note at the train station saying that she can never see him again.  That is, until their paths cross again in Casablanca.  To add to the stress, the Nazis, led by the pinch-faced Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt), decide to march into Casablanca as well.  Their intent:  To capture Laslo and prevent him from stirring up strength against the Nazis on the other side of the world. CASABLANCA benefits greatly from a dynamite script, great directing and, for once, the perfect union of casting and character.  By now, most people know how the film ends.  This is even more impressive since the ending to the film was being written even as the cameras began rolling to shoot it.  Two endings had been written, but when the producers saw the ending that was shot (the one used in the film), they saw no need to shoot the other ending.  Needless to say, CASABLANCA is a part of my film library. If it's not in your's, you're only depriving yourself.",Casablanca

Humprey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are our two stars and these two have an amazing chemistry and you can tell that their charcters Rick and Illsa do love each other and they have a intimte relationship before the events of the war split them up and they only have the memories of Paris. The supporting cast of Paul Henreid,Claude Rains,Conrad Veidt,Sydney Greenstreet,Peter Lorre.S.Z.

353,ks4,Truly one of the more memorable romantic movies of all time.,8,16 May 2004,"CasablancaCasablanca is one of the few remaining parts of an unoccupied France, still the german are around there. Casablanca is also one of the few places where it is possible to get free of charge to American, the free country during the war. Rick's Cafe is the coolest place in town. One day a known Czech underground leader arrives with his beautiful wife, Ilsa, to whom Rick once had a short but wonderful affair in Paris. Finally! Finally, i had the chance to view one of the most famous movies in the history, Casablanca. Some may say it's a mother to all future romantic movie, and there are indeed many things in the movie that have been copied one way or the other, but that is mainly because this movie seems to have written a small manual for how to make an interesting love drama. I haven't seen many movies this old, so who am I to judge, but there is no doubt this movie has aged like a very fine wine, even today, black and white as it is, this is still a movie that will always stand as a remarkable romantic movie, maybe even the mother of all romantic movies. I can at least say that even now, so many years after, and my young age taken in consideration, this movie still has an effect on me, and it never gets boring at all, it keeps the perfect pace for all 110 minutes, which is quite outstanding.Now for those who think Casablanca is just a romantic movie, it's not, actually it has many others aspects to it. And i think that is why this movie works so well, we see other problems being taken up, perfectly they are adjusted so there are not too many of them and the romantic issue is still the main theme, but the sub problems works well. Especially i noticed how the movie always got our interest opened for something that feels kept as a secret, for example the past of both Rick and Ilsa, before they met in Paris. That single thing was never revealed until very late in the story, which for me meant that i was constantly curious to find out more throughout the movie.The movie is quite good directed, the director have found an nearly perfect pace for the movie all along, it never gets boring and manages to be entertaining and interesting all the way through, something that i think is quite amazing, the time flew by so fast I was amazed when it ended. And that is indeed a good thing, i hate it when movies have to bring up boring sequences, and it's something that for me drags down a lot in my overall opinion, but Casablanca really impressed me on that.The acting is also quite good for this movie, acting in the earlier days are usually very different than modern days. That goes for this movie too. Best was Mr. Bogart, i actually thought he did a very good job playing a cynic man, who deep within had a heart of gold, all it took for it to open was the one woman. Ingrid Bergman played a fine role too, although i disliked her false tears, they didn't look very convincing to me.To sum it all up a bit. There is no doubt this one of the greatest romantic movies of the history, and it is the work of a perfectionist, every single detail seem to be thought through, and the movie works fantastically well and has very few flaws. The movie has aged perfectly, I think one of the main reasons to this is that there are barely any use of special effects in the movie, something that is very easy to spot now a days, but this movie can be watched without problems, even now a days. If i had to point a negative side out, which I have to do naturally, the movie didn't make me cry and really feel with my heart as I was hoping for, the movie is good no doubt, but i never really fell in love with the characters. Something that i think is necesarry for a romantic movie to succed to a top grade, but there is no doubt anyway, if i get the chance, then I will watch this movie again.8/10",Casablanca

355,brower8,Masterpiece of understatement,10,22 January 2004,"Without doubt the cast is incomparable, but even so the script is the real star of Casablanca. Everyone has a sob story to tell (except for the Nazis who have given people the material for their own sob stories), but the movie would sink into the most depressing experience possible if the script didn't cut off the sob stories before people started to show self-pity. The only self-pitying character is Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) -- who doesn't realize how lucky he is to be an American. Such is the genius of this movie, the explanation of its location in both the AFI's ""100 Best Films"" and IMDb voters' choice of it -- both in the Top 10. Today it is impossible to imagine anyone not delving into one's own abyss of hurt feelings under such circumstances. Casablanca in 1941 is Purgatory; occupied Europe is Hell, even if it is a man-made Inferno, and the Nazis intend to make their Hell more fearsome than any that Dante thought up.Casablanca succeeds because it forces us to feel empathy for the victims of nazism -- people who have been sent into concentration camps, rich people who have become paupers because the Nazis confiscated their fortunes, people displaced. We are left to our own devices to imagine what Rick Blaine and Ilse Lund (Bergman) did in Paris. We find comic elements, but the comic scenes underscore the desperation that people feel, as in the pickpocket vignette; as the pickpocket fleeces a patron of Rick's bar, the pickpocket gives a smarmy lecture ""there are vipers, vipers..."", and the Dutch banker feels his pockets. Happiness is entirely to be found in nostalgia for better days, or hope for the future for a restoration of things as they were before the war. Who can forget the scene in which the Germans sing ""Die Wacht am Rhein"" (actually, an innocuous patriotic song from the 19th century), only to hear almost everyone else break into a rousing ""Marseillaise"", with the resolution of the situation with the police prefect ordering the bar closed for ""gambling"", the police prefect collecting his winnings. Casablanca relates one moment in time -- arguably the most desperate moment in time for refugees from the Hell of nazi Germany and its empire, when Britain stood alone or when Russia seemed on the brink of collapse, before the United States was in the war and sealed the fate of nazi Germany, and before the fullest horrors of nazism became known.This is an absolute must see. A basic rule for any collection: it is far better to have one great movie than five ""fair"" ones, and forget the bad ones altogether.",Casablanca
356,ColeSear,Pure Entertainment (spoilers),7,31 January 2003,"In Casablanca what is most noticeable is the way separate filmic elements join to create a whole. Under the supervision of Michael Curtiz all the necessary ingredients to make this film successful come together magically. I use the word successful because that's what the film is. It does what it sets out to do. It's fun to watch and not high art nor the most involving and deeply moving experience in film history but it works. 	 Curtiz's direction deserves to be mentioned first with all the ballyhoo and trumpet-tounged praise this film receives I had never known the name of the man who directed the film. In this film not only does he construct a very well-told visual narrative but he also provide some frames that floored me, most noticeably an establishing shot of The Blue parrot including an actual blue parrot, and the shadow used to establish La Belle Aurore. His insistence on his casting decisions also made the film what it is as a landmark in Hollywood history. Changing any one of the actors would likely have made the studio's prediction of it being a flop-come-true. 	 Humphrey Bogart could not have been better suited for his part. For through most of the film we see Rick Blain as cool and unflinching. Only in the flashback do we see his more emotional and less pragmatic side. Slowly we see revelations he helps the Humgarian girl he also quarrels with Ilsa over their failed love affair. Even in this film we find Bogart in his persona of the heroic loner which we would find in many of his films. 	 In what is probably the best piece of casting was Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa. Aesthetically Bergman has one of those faces that was just made to be filmed in black and white. She is luminous. She plays Ilsa to a tee and truly makes the love affair back drop of the film both during the flashback sequence and when she pleads in tears for Rick's assistance. In every film romance both actors have to be equals and suited for one another, this pair is. 	 The secondary players were also crucial. In such a way they can scarcely be called secondary characters. The most artistic part of Casablanca is that Curtiz both in the beginning and towards the end takes us amongst, little vignettes, snatches of the lives of the people who live their temporary existences in this town that's merely a gateway to Lisbon, then America. With the dual story of refugees and the love stories the secondary characters take on even greater importance. Claude Rains, when he's on the screen it's like there's no one else around. His excuse for closing down the café was the only dialogue that stuck in my head after so many years without having watched it. Rains plays his character in such a way that his change of heart at the end is justified and, as written, he is the most complex of all the characters. Peter Lorre, played Ugarte, he was absent through much of the film but Lorre with that voice always leaves an impression with the audience. He also seems to exude a kind of helplessness in this part. Syndey Greenstreet seemed to be the Fat Man out of The Maltese Falcon but in the end he helps his share of people and does a good job also. 	What made itself apparent to me this time as opposed to the first time I saw the film was the omnipresence of propaganda in Casablanca. Propaganda is often regarded as a four-letter word, and that's not always the case but it should always looked at with suspicion. In this film it's handled so intelligently and it's Positive-Propaganda, meaning that it's a call to action rather than a character assassination or anti-something. Rick is told ""Isolationism isn't a practical policy.' He's the only American character of the major figures this is a call to action for the American public to support the US war effort in Europe. The propaganda in this film is so incisive, intelligent and organic to the plot that it shows what a powerful medium film really is. It's interesting to note also that the film was made up of cast and crew mostly from Europe, director Micheal Curtiz, Peter Lorre and Paul Heinreid (Victor Laszlo) were born in the Austro-Hungarian empire, Igrid Bergman was Swedish, Claude Rains and Sydney Greenstreet were English and Colonel Srasser was played by a legend of German cinema Conrad Veidt. 	 What we have in Casablanca is film that can be enjoyed from any angle you look at it. It is a film that will transcend generations for years to come.",Casablanca
357,olliecurtis,I can't get into this film!,5,17 November 2020,"This film is a classic. That's undeniable. But I just can't get into it! Maybe it was the extended flashback sequences, but I was a bit bored watching this one! You might like it though so don't skip it.",Casablanca
358,johnmschofield,A masterpiece for all times,10,13 August 2009,This isn't a film I watch very often but when I do I always promise myself I will watch it more and in my case it never actually happens. I really do not know the reason other than maybe my approach to this film is that it is like visiting a relative who although I like lives many miles away. It will always be there unlike the relative though and that makes it even more special. This film grabs you very early but you need to pay attention because there are so many subtle facial changes of expression and body language movements that you can easily miss something. Like most of the great films it is timeless in that although it was made almost seventy years ago it can still captivate the viewer. It is a deceptively simple story but as always it gets complicated for all sorts of reasons. The film was of course made during the second world war but this has a series of emotional battle scenes and the whole experience is riveting and without doubt a masterpiece for all times.,Casablanca
359,donuthaters12,Curtiz's Magnum Opus,10,2 July 2013,"A film that is regarded as a classic from most but does it hold up for me? Definitely. Michael Curtiz is the director of Casablanca, who has done a mountain full of films including The Adventures of Robin Hood and Mildred Pierce. I came into this with high expectations, even in my subsequent viewings, as it has an established cast, a well known composer, a prominent director and an experienced cinematographer. The film is definitely excellent but some elements, due to nitpicking, sinks this film a little.The screenplay is developed by the Epstein brothers who had a reputation at their time, and with this project they seem to be in the top of their game. The film's story is packed, exploring a love story, a rebellion and the life of a citizens or immigrants in Casablanca. The film is generally well known for its love story but that wasn't the area that hooked me as I felt it was dragged by it's melodrama. The shifty and uneasy life in this desert city is what kept me hook and it dominates the first half of the film. It is from the start that the film establishes the importance of the city as a character along with the leading actors. The first and start of the second act is dominated with humor as a break from the main storyline which held my interest. I do not hate the love story but I just feel it doesn't hold up with me as compared to the more later love stories in Hollywood, Annie Hall, Vertigo and Beauty and the Beast. Then again, this is a product of its time and I can't frown upon it too much just because of that.This is the only film I have seen of Curtiz's work but it isn't the only one I am aware of. He is an underrated director and one of the hardest working. With Casablanca, he just got hold of a fantastic script which got the general public to really notice him. Curtiz wanted this film to move quickly but also giving key moments in exploring the relationship between Bogart and Bergman's characters.The year before Casablanca, Arthur Edeson did the cinematography for The Maltese Falcon and in that film, Edeson used shadows well and using lighting to create the mood of the scene. He brings it back here but more. This film is dark, for the most part as most of the intimate scenes took place indoors and at night. Shadow casts on scenes with Bogart and Bergman but at the same time not overshadowing the actors, especially Bergman's beautiful face as her beauty and vulnerability expressed by her face as both are important components of Ilsa. Edeson and Curtiz always have the camera moving, whether it is inside Rick's club or outside in the streets of Casablanca. It keeps the film at a pace that doesn't feel stationary and gives us a sense of exploration of the setting. This pace is also supported by great editing. In intimate moments, Curtiz really wants Edeson to have the camera get close on the actor's faces to not only have us focus on it but to create that sense of intimacy and closeness. Casablanca still has great photography, even in this day and age, and is an important piece in making it an iconic film.Max Steiner was nominated in 1939 for his iconic work in Gone With The Wind and he was also nominated a few years later for score in Casablanca. His work here in Casablanca is definitely something to be remembered by fan when remembering this film. This should have been an area where it definitely should have won the academy award but sadly it lost to The Song of Bernadette.For a film focused on the love story and is this intimate requires actors that bring that chemistry in order to create a memorable performance. Bogart and Bergman definitely work well together but I felt that Bogart is a little too old for Bergman. I would rather have the age of Bergman's character be nearly level with Bogart's and replace her with an older actress, but would the film still be regarded as a classic if the casting choices were different? I think so and I am only nitpicking. Both Bogart and Bergman bring it their all, even if the script is a little melodramatic they make it work for the most part. I definitely enjoyed Bogart's embodiment as this stoic and tortured character who distances himself from letting people in. Bergman has the more overly dramatic lines but she still delivers by showing emotion and care for Bogart's character. As soon as she was introduced in the film and meets Sam (Dooley Wilson), you can see that pain and sorrow rising to the surface. The supporting cast are fine and are either used for plot tools or comedic relief. The actors giving comic relief, especially Claude Reins, had me smiling every time they say something witty.A film that definitely still holds a strong place in this day and age and is regarded as one of the greatest films ever made. It is a fascinating story of a love story and an interesting take on the life of Casablanca during the second world war. It has its flaws but it's overshadowed by its strengths. Casablanca is definitely worth your time and demands repeated viewings.",Casablanca
360,jcarlos-96740,So overrated,6,16 April 2020,"My expectations were higher about this movie due the high ratings and to the fact that to a lot people this is one of the best movies ever, but after watching I don't really now why. Before anything else let me clear that I'm not that stupid dude who can't watch nothing before 2000, Citizen Kane is one year older that this and I completely loved it and rated it 10/10 but this movie felt really... average.To me this is a romance that marked that time due the historical and political context and the subjects that the movie has in it but the story itself is just a lame and boring love story with a extreme level of predictability, it's so predictable that when I read the synopsis I already knew how this was going to end, I hoped that I was wrong but unfortunately I wasn't. Besides the predictability, the plot was boring, the acting was average, there is no character development so you don't get attached to any of them. I know this was a propaganda movie and this actually sell's well the ideia of patriotism and victory against Germany, but the fact that this was for propaganda purposes should say a lot about this, the movie was rushed and the expectations were low but by some miracle everyone came to think that this is a masterpiece.
To me this is an american (propaganda) popcorn movie and nothing more then that. It's also one of the most quoted movies but I found a lot of the dialogues to be boring and unnecessary to the story development.It was well made but it wasn't a cinematography masterpiece if you ask me, in the first minutes we have a scene where a guy gets shot and then there's no blood no bullet wound no nothing he just drops himself awfully on the floor and when the police go to him he has nothing but a little bit of blood in his mouth... now I know it was 1942 but they could've done it better. It's a well made movie but far to be a masterpiece. It",Casablanca
361,JosephPezzuto,Reel Look: 'Casablacna',8,14 January 2015,"""Here's looking at you, kid."" The year 1940 signaled a final turning point for isolationism. German military successes in Europe prompted nationwide American rethinking about its posture toward the war. Even if America did manage to repel invasions, its way of life might wither if it were forced to become a garrison state. Isolationism now became involvement, as thousands of brave soldiers battled their way through many historical battles and a fight for ultimate freedom. Franklin Roosevelt convinced a largely isolationist Congress to pass the Land-Lease Act, allowing the U.S. to sell or lend war materials to ""any country whose defense the President deems vital to the defense of the United States."" A true war was occurring, and the American people would never dream of succumbing to the Nazi way. However, it seemed that people across the world were all in a whirlwind of discomfort and desperation to survive. These changes, also portrayed by Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), truly captivates what terror has been wrought upon the souls of Europe, and how anxious people captivated by dread and by just living one more day was a miracle in and of itself. But how did this whole outbreak of escaping and massacre soften Rick to a point where he finally did stick his neck out to a desperate couple in breaking free from the world in which he knew that ultimately became a matter of life and death? Let's take a look.From the play 'Everybody Comes to Rick's' by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison, the film opens to early December 1941, where we meet American expatriate Rick, the proprietor of an upscale nightclub and gambling den in the titular African district entitled ""Rick's Café Américain"". From here we eventually learn that Rick is the sole ticket out of this place back to the States, of whom Rick looks over concerning problems of his own. He is suave, cool and likable, but sticks his neck out for no one. But that all changes when a long-lost love Ilsa Lund (the beautiful Ingrid Bergman) appears in his section of Morocco after a hiatus of many years (Play it, Sam.). Later, Rick sits in his darkened café at the counter of his bar, a drink in front of him to numb the pain of the memories of his past love life that and dwindled away to the present war that soured and choked out the world he once knew to cherish around him only to be replaced with death and despair. A puff of smoke dances and swirls around him as he pounds his fist down on the countertop in frustration to when he recalled simpler times to the tinny tunes of his house pianist Dooley Wilson's (Sam) somber melody (the clinking of champagne glasses compared to the sounds of gunfire). ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world..."". Rick can simply not get his mind off of Ilsa, of whom he had seen earlier after years of absence, this time with a new lover by her side named Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). But Ilsa, still having feelings for Rick, needs him only to transport her and her husband back to America via passports. Rick, as mentioned before, sticks his neck out for no one, and is internally bitter at Ilsa for marrying Laszlo do to his unspoken feelings he has still kept for her all these war-torn years but has yet failed to confess. When Isla points a gun point-blank at Rick much later in the film out of utter desperation after asking him over and over for the letters of departure, Rick still keeps his cool. He knows that he would soon die anyway there and tells her that she would be doing him a personal favor. Near the end of the film a gun is pointed again, this time by Rick at a German captain as he tells him to get away from the phone. Upon refusing, Rick shoots him and the captain falls to the ground in cold blood. As Claude Reins' Captain Louis Renault, after witnessing such an act orders to his troops when they arrive on the scene to ""Round up the usual suspects!"" with Rick standing right beside them, is priceless. With flashbacks of Rick and Ilsa to easier times and days when they could enjoy each other's love and company to their present departure as Ilsa is about to head back to America on a plane with Laszlo, a story like this can still have some romance amidst a murky world surrounded by war, can't it? It's at least something Rick has left to hold on to when its all he has to stay sane in a flavorless period in history. Ranked as one of the greatest films of all time, winning Oscars for Best Script, Producer and Director by the great Michael Curtiz, 'Casablanca' is a spectacular film in and of itself and a truly remarkable albeit bittersweet love story with a mix of humor of a beautiful bond that can never be between two estranged souls but remains alive and unbroken for both to share and to hold forever in their hearts. This film, for me, will always remain a true classic and for all movie lovers alike, and, with each viewing, will only become more wonderful as time goes by.",Casablanca
362,Roger_Sterling,"""Here's looking at you, kid""",10,26 June 2006,"Casablanca is appealing to me, for only a few reasons, one being the setting. The fact that is takes place in still-unoccupied France gives it a sense of danger, letting the viewer know people are going to Casablanca to get away from the war. The love story is amazing and classic, and this is coming from a guy that doesn't like romantic movies. Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa is beautiful in this movie, and it's not hard to see why Rick fell for her so hard. The music-especially a certain song-you know what I'm talking about-is still a classic. This is possibly Humphrey Bogart's most well-known role, and only a cynic couldn't see why. And the final reason, this movie has some of the most famous quotes in movie history. Just look them up and you'll see what I mean. It's a shame more people my age can't appreciate great movies like this anymore.

363,shadow_blade-89459,Classic,10,27 October 2017,"""Casablanca"" (1942) is the golden standard for film even with a few minor flaws. The movie is about nightclub owner, Richard ""Rick"" Blaine played by Humphrey Bogart, and his vision on life as he knows it. He is faced with tough decisions that he easily overcomes or easily pushes away until his one true love, Ilsa Lund played by Ingrid Bergman, appears on his doorstep.The scripting in this film is ""cheesy"" by modern day conversations standards, but is still powerful. If you watch this film, you will find yourself quoting some of these famous lines. Every shot is intentional. Michael Curtiz shoots with a purpose. If a scene is intended for you to feel an emotion, Curtiz shoots in a way to help you feel that emotion.The film is visually black and white, but mentally colorful. Rick is the man men want to be.

364,maitreg,Overrated,5,16 January 2002,"I'm not quite sure why so many people like this movie.  It must be from decades of being told by the media that it's a great movie.  But it's very hard to ""enjoy"" it.  I could not connect on an emotional level to any of the characters.  I got the feeling the director was trying to create sympathy for Bogart's ""Rick"" but it's hard to feel anything for a self-abusive, chauvinist, murdering, adulturer who never sees the error in his ways.Every character except Peter Lorre's ""Ugarte"" is a cliche and overacted. Hollywood could only have gotten away with this in 1942.  If anything this silly was produced today, it would be laughed right out of the theatre and onto video in a just a few weeks for being so unbelievable and ridiculous.And what does ""Here's looking at you, kid."" even mean?  It's just another stupid, catch-phrase that has no real meaning.Maybe this movie's popularity was related to the anti-Nazism of the time.  I don't know.  I wasn't around then.

365,Paddy-49,A serendipitous masterpiece,9,27 June 2014,"Casablanca is a perfect artistic creation. It is a film which cannot be improved upon and one that, more than 70 years on, still has the power to surprise, amaze and entertain. It is not, and was never I think meant to be, realistic. By this I mean not just that it is not a true story but that it could never conceivably have been seen to be. The broad canvas of the city of Casablanca in the early years of the Second World War is authentic but the story which unfolds, the characters and the detail is of course fiction. This in no way negates the legitimacy of the movie which is far deeper than just telling a story would be. In this respect it is very akin to a painting or a sonnet. A painting is constrained by the two- dimensional static format and a sonnet by the rules of verse. But that doesn't mean that powerful messages cannot be conveyed. So it is with Casablanca. This is a film about love, betrayal, honour, sacrifice, loyalty, friendship, man's capacity for evil as well as for goodness. It is about judgment, weakness, kindness, passion, greed, and how even the most venal power can be overcome with courage. Put like that it sounds a bit pious but, of course, it is not pious at all. It is exceptionally humorous at times. The constraint is imposed by the need to reduce complex human emotions to filmable moments. It is full of metaphors which help this along. ""As time goes by"" is not a theme song but a symbol of times past not time present. Rick had forbidden Sam to play the song because it stirred too strongly the memories of his and Ilsa's time together in Paris. When Ilsa turns up in Casablanca she insists that Sam plays it and so signals her wish to return in some way to Rick. The playing of the Marseillaise in the bar to rebut the Germans is symbolic of the struggle between good and evil. It is a courageous and provocative thing to do. And it contrasts neatly with the character development of Rick and the police Chief Renault. Each of them has to be pragmatic to survive and they cheat, lie and deceive as part of this. But as we suspect from the start with Rick, and come to learn with Renault deep down these are good men. The means justifies the ends if those ends are honourable. Rick, like many great heroes (there is an intriguing parallel with Oskar Schindler here) has to be tough and do things he would prefer not to do. But when tested he comes up trumps. There is an illustrative sub plot with a young Bulgarian newly married couple who Rick helps to get exit visas to Lisbon, he doesn't need to do this and there are risks. But inspired by his inherent sense of decency he does it. Casablanca is a love story - or actually two. The one between Humphrey Bogart's Rick and Ingrid Bergman's Ilsa and the one between Ilsa and her husband Victor Lazslo. Bergman's performance is sensational. The close-ups show her astonishing beauty and make Rick's passion for her wholly credible. There is an intriguing moral sub plot about Ilsa and Rick's brief affair in Paris (shown in flashback). We learn that Lazslo was missing presumed dead when this happened. This reduces the adulterous nature of the liaison - maybe a nod to the moral precepts of Hollywood in 1942? We also learn that Ilsa's failure to escape Paris with Rick is because Viktor has turned up - something that Rick was unaware of. Casablanca is a highly moral film - ironically because few of the characters seem to have strong moral principles at all. But, as we have seen, this is artifice. Lazslo is a man of high moral attitudes with a track record to match. Ilsa supports him and loves him for this and when it comes to the crunch she chooses her husband over Rick. Though Rick himself makes this easy for her by insisting at the end that she fly off with Lazslo rather than stay in Casablanca with him. The greatness of Casablanca comes from the ménage a trois and from the colourful key supporting characters. It comes from the juxtaposition of good and evil all within the claustrophobic tight world of wartime Casablanca. It comes too from the tight, pacy direction and a clever evocation of time and place. The film is iconic with dialogue that has entered the vernacular ""Here's looking at you kid"" ""This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" ""round up the usual suspects."" ""We'll always have Paris"" ""Play it Sam, play 'As Time Goes By'"" ""Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life."" But above all it comes from the characters and from their portrayal by a cast all at the top of their form.Movies unlike paintings or poems are collective endeavours. Assemble the right actors. Write a filmable script. Get a good Director. And yet, and yet. It isn't enough. Casablanca works because these basics are right. If is a masterpiece because, serendipitously, what is in part a random collection of elements somehow works as a whole. The whole far exceeds the sum of the parts.",Casablanca

These actors are fully vested in this film and more complex and nuanced performances you'll never see. Every aspect of this film is genius - from the story to the cinematography (and...I'm not sure...but could one argue that this was the very first and very best example of the film noire genre - does this qualify? It certainly sets the standard.) The tension is palpable, the dialog crackles with wit and intensity...for my money this is impossible to top. And it stays taught right to the very end...and who could argue that the very last line isn't the very best and most memorable in film history (in a film replete with memorable lines)? It's a great romance, a great thriller, a great War movie...it succeeds on so many levels - most EVERY level. And it is so riveting! It thrills from start to finish. And these are characters that not only love people and truly love each other, which makes you care all the more about their fates. These are characters you fall in love with and come to admire deeply, for the heroism they display in the face of almost insurmountable odds. (Can anyone not be moved by Sam's devotion to his bristly boss, Rick? That relationship defines the word ""true friend."" I had a friend like that once - they do exist - but they are a rare breed...and how moving is it to see this kind of thing in action in Casablanca?!) These characters are examples for us all - and though imaginary, they are recreations of real heroes who existed at the time and defeated the forces of evil in World War II. Bogie fans, of course, will love this film (it is arguably his finest...which is saying a lot, since his performances in The Treasure of Sierra Madre, Key Largo and many other films were brilliant too), as will Ingrid Bergman fans (her performance here rivals her performance in Notorious)...but you don't have to be a fan of any of them to recognize their greatness in Casablanca. (Peter Lorre deserves a mention too - his work here is memorable and noteworthy; it's a shame he wasted his great talent in too many lesser films afterward - except, of course, for The Maltese Falcon, his re-pairing with Bogie - which made for a wonderful chemistry.) Wow!",Casablanca

Casablanca is just one of the classic old movies-especially one with a consistently enjoyable story. Of course, the film runs a little slow at times, but then picks up more as the film goes on. Therefore, the viewer feels more engaged into the storyline and conflict of the film.
Not only that, Casablanca has one of the best endings in classic cinema. Everything is just brilliantly summarized in that ending, and the resolution just feels satisfying in the end. Overall, Casablanca is just one of the great pieces of classic cinema (among many).",Casablanca

I thought it was dramatically lacking in the screenplay -- the characters walk in and out and never truly involve each other.  You never get the truth about what these characters really want from each other, nor is there any clear central point to the story.It seems to me what people like about this film most is the glamour of Ingrid Bergman -- and the low key cool act of Humphrey Bogart.

372,andrew7,what can I say?,10,25 February 2002,"I have practically nothing to say about this film.  Apparently, some people seem not to like it.  This is utterly baffling to me.  The vast majority of people seem to love it, which is my idea of justice.  This film deserves to be adored. There are two different kinds of Great Films, in my mind.  One is the film that quite obviously sets out to be great, and succeeds.  Something like ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Citizen Kane"", ""Schindler's List"", just about everything Kubrick ever did.  That sort of thing.  Films that are oozing with ambition, and manage to carry it off.  ""Casablanca"" isn't like that. ""Casablanca"" is a small film, a simple film, and it doesn't have that ambition behind it.  This film isn't trying to make a statement, or to do something bold, new, and shocking.  It's great simply by virtue of being very, very good.  The primary credit for this goes to those responsible for the script, including the actual scriptwriters, and the authors of the play upon which it was based.  The central premise of this film is the bizarre tangle of motivations involving Rick, Ilsa, and Victor.  That idea is both elegantly simple and breathtakingly effective.  [There again, a common theme in my reviews of late... simplicity and power are natural allies.]  The performances by Bogart, Bergman, and Henreid are fully up to the task, bringing out every nuance of the situation.  This film also sports one of the all time great supporting casts, including big names like Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre.  But there isn't a single performance in the entire film which rings false.  This also has a lot to do with pulling this film up from a good one to a great one. 
For those who don't like this film, well, I don't know what to say.  The attitude is incomprehensible to me.  But that's all right.  As long as you've seen it, that's enough.  I think there are a few things that are so good, so useful, and beneficial, that everyone should do them at some point. Take piano lessons.  Study elementary economics.  Watch ""Casablanca"".  And if you don't like it, fine, you don't like it.  But you just have to see it.",Casablanca

The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.""YOU MUST REMEMBER THIS: ""CASABLANCA"" made its debut on Nov. 26, 1942, at New York's Hollywood Theater. Shooting had begun on May 25th of that same year -- with an unfinished script. The myths over who wrote what, and when, have become as much of cinema lore as the film's plot itself. In an interview on Dec. 3, 1987, Jules J. Epstein -- one of the three credited writers on the film -- said even he was uncertain: ""To tell you the truth, it's almost impossible to tell who wrote what now. I read somewhere that (producer) Hal Wallis said he wrote the movie's last line -- when Bogart says to Claude Rains (a Vichy minion who helped Ingrid Bergman and Paul Henreid's characters escape the Nazis): 'I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.' And that could be. We originally had Rains saying that line, then Bogart finishing with, ""Yeah, but don't forget you owe me 10,000 francs.' We writers thought that last was more typical of him, but it was changed and it may have been Hal who changed it. At the time there was much confusion because the studio had a deadline -- 52 films were released each year, and this was just one of them. We were like any other film -- we took 30 days to film, maybe a couple of days more, and that was it."" Jules Epstein, his brother Philip and Howard Koch won screen writing Oscars for their work on the film, which also earned Academy Awards for best picture and best director (Michael Curtiz). Said Koch in a separate interview: ""Looking back, the picture seemed to have a life of its own. Whatever happened to it seemed to be for the good. I had an almost mystical feel to it."" Jules Epstein and Koch said two endings were considered. The first -- and the one that was used -- had Bergman flying to Lisbon with her husband (Henreid), leaving Bogart behind. The second had her staying with Bogart. Contrary to Hollywood legend, only the first ending was actually shot. ""Bergman was the one who was worried about which ending we would use,"" Epstein said. ""It didn't bother Bogart -- nobody looked at it as a classic film, and he made four or five pictures a year anyway. Bergman came up to us on the set and asked, 'How can I play love scenes without knowing which man I end up with? Which one will it be?' And we told her, 'As soon as we know, we'll let you know.'"" In yet another interview Henreid said he knew all along what no one else knew -- that, under terms of his contract, he had to wind up with Bergman, something which even the writers didn't know. ""There were no two ways about it,"" Henreid said. ""That was written in the contract and signed by Warner Brothers. You musn't forget, they were very unsure of Bogart at that point. The film that brought him 'Casablanca' was 'High Sierra,' and the star of 'High Sierra' was not Bogart -- it was Ida Lupino.""",Casablanca

I have wallowed in some of the finest performances ever captured on film, from Bogart's world weariness through to Claude Rains pragmatism, via the slimmy character of Peter Lorre and the largeness of Sydney Greenstreet. There is hardly a foot put wrong by any cast member, and the film is as near perfect as any film can possibly be.I used the term 'thought I knew it' above quite deliberately, because I was recently privilege to see a brand new digital print version of this classic movie. As the camera moved around the interior of Rick's Cafe American for the first time I thought something was wrong, the scene seemed 'foggy', then it clicked, what I was seeing was the smoke from the cigarettes! The print was so crisp and clear that it was like watching the film for the very first time. The exterior shots were incredibly bright, the dialogue clear and wonderfully full of crack and cackle, exactly as you would expect in a busy place as Casablanca! I have no need hear to go into the narrative, if you have seen the film you will know it backwards, and if you haven't, then why have you never watched this masterpiece?

376,Stephen-12,The best,10,8 October 1998,"There are so many reasons why this is the greatest movie ever made. Here are some of my main reasons:1. There is not one single poor performance.2. The film surpasses a mere love story. It contains some splendid jokes, political intrigue, acts of war, corrupt officials, black marketeering, violence, and moral courage.3. As for that love story, can you think of any more mature exposition in movie history of the classic love triangle? The dynamics between Rick, Ilsa and Viktor are perfectly judged: Rick wants to hurt the woman who left him for what he sees as an inferior man (but whom he secretly admires); Ilsa is torn between her duties as a wife and the partner of an international hero, and the genuine passion she feels for Rick; Viktor knows exactly what his wife is feeling, but finds it easier to be a martyr, because he thinks that's his duty.4. The photography is terrific (example: when Rick opens the safe to get the money out just before Major Strasse arrive - we see only his shadow on the world, dwarfing Claude Rains).5. The music is wonderful, and has proved hugely durable.There are about 100 other reasons to admire this film, but these will do for now.",Casablanca

And the audience reaction was like the movie just came out yesterday. Here's a movie that assumes that the average audience has intelligence. And the tons of laughs were all in the right places for the right reasons. Twenty years later, I can still hear the laughter and applause...and the cheers; especially for that now classic closing line.If more black and white classics were given this kind of DVD treatment (the recent 2 disc release), then I'd own more black and white classics. Bogart's brilliant portrayal was ahead of its time and no one else but Bergman could of been Elsa. Same for Rains, Henreid, Sakall, Veidt and EVERYONE else. Perfect cast, perfect acting.It's a shame most people will never see this with an audience because this is a crowd pleaser if ever there was one. So the next best thing is the quality and care that was put into the new DVD. Believe it or not, this makes a great ""at home"" date flick. And even have a few friends over...but not the 'chatty' ones. There's just too much to miss if so and so starts to ""yackitty! yackitty! yackitty! during the many (& there are many) priceless and subtle moments. This movie deserves full attention.

This one film has more great 'one liners' than some hundred movies put together. And it still seems as fresh today as when...well; when I saw it the 1st time.It's not that ""they don't make em like this anymore"" applies to 'Casablanca' because most movies, for every year, in every era (since the 1920's); aren't very good. It's always the very few that rise above the heap, every year; especially when you take into account that over 100 movies are made every year.

And rightly so: all aspects of the production have no glitches whatsoever. Plotwise, the film recounts the aftermath of a romance undermined by a disaster (in this case, a devastating war): a theme forever exploited for its box-office potential. Here, the three-hankie quotient is relatively low due to an intelligent script which concentrates on Europe's reaction to a near-apocalyptic threat to its way of life and its freedom of spirit. We also have some unforgettable musical moments (and an answer for why the Beatles used ""La Marselliase"" in ""All You Need Is Love""), the inspiration behind the Mos Eisley cantina in ""Star Wars"", the only representation of a black character up to that time that wasn't somehow demeaning, references which are widely speculated to be bisexual, and so much more! Some characters, one has to admit, are better developed than others (Bergman, who pimps herself back to Bogart in order to help the Resistance, is considerably more interesting elsewhere), but the writing is flawless and works of cinema and literature are still being named after the movie's lines of dialogue, one as recently as '95.

Last night I finally had the chance to watch it and I was very surprised how good it actually was even this day when movies are so different. If you are going to watch this movie you honestly have to relate to the time when it was made, because if you're going to watch it like any other movie, you may be disappointed.It was breath taking to see how detailed this movie actually was. Everything's just so precise, from the dialog to every single item that you see on the screen, even if it was only in the background. You can't even compare the acting to acting these days, it just isn't anything near it, as it's a totally different art form of its own, so significant and so great. Every single word spoken by every character is so powerful and compelling, every word is precise and carefully chosen. Humphrey Bogart is perfect for the role, a bad ass American, Rick Blaine, who owns a night club at Casablanca during the World War II, but yet he is surprisingly soft-hearted. Then there's the beautiful Ingrid Bergman, whose beauty shines through the screen in her role of Ilsa Lund, the woman who was Rick's one time love when they met in Paris. The story between Rick and Ilsa is filled with passion like no other, making the whole movie one of the most passionate movies ever made.The screenplay's just excellent and it also compliments the whole directing of the movie. It progresses with scenes that are just so phenomenal, so legendary and so nostalgic. It includes one of the most legendary quotes in the history of motion pictures, for example; ""Play it once, Sam"", ""We'll always have Paris"" and ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"". Even when I had never seen the movie, I just immediately recognised those sentences and smiled, as they are among the sentences everybody knows even if they've never seen ""Casablanca"" before. The whole plot is also surprisingly exciting, comparing to the plots nowadays it would definitely work in any movie, as it is just so thrilling from the beginning till the end and you just can't know how it ends before the last minute of the movie. The final solution's just genius and it's actually so good that I had to start clapping my hands together when the movie ended. Superb.One of the best things now when I've seen the film is that I can finally be proud in saying ""I've seen Casablanca. And I love it"" Even after 65 years, ""Casablanca"" simply shines, making it enjoyable in every imaginable way. It's thrilling, it's passionate, it's flowing and it's just excellent.

386,larrysmile1,Summary: The Greatest Love Story of Our Time,10,24 September 2001,"If you are a patriotic person you will ""know"" that to win a war requires great sacrifices of your own desires, wants, and needs. Here, in Casablanca we have a simple story, of which the movie producers themselves didn't think would become such a classic, which has captured the hearts of all who see this movie.Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine is a man's man. He is courageous and fights a war on his terms with his own resources. The beautiful Ingrid Bergman portrays a woman (Ilsa Lund Laszlo) torn between her true love and her duty to her husband whom she once believed was killed in the war. The moral is that ""duty"" takes precedence over personal feelings.Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo the ""underground resistance leader"" plays his role straight with dedication to the cause of freedom and ""understanding"" when he learns of Ilsa and Rick's past affair in Paris, France. The most inspiring part was when Victor leads a song challenge with the French National Anthem in Rick's club against the boastful German Army. The emotion of this scene was so strong that it brings tears to the eyes of any true patriot.If you are a lover of Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, and Claude Rains, you will find classic performances here! Conrad Veidt played the German Major Strasser to form. I understand that Madeleine LeBeau (Yvonne)is actually French and you can see the tears of patriotism on her face as she sings a most inspiring rendition of Le Marseillaise (French National Anthem).Dooley Wilson plays Rick's piano player in Casablanca. It is true that ""the world will always welcome lovers"" As Time Goes By! ""You played it for her - you can play it for me. Play it, Sam. Play it!""",Casablanca

Peter Lorre as a pathetic loser, Sidney Greenstreet is still ""The Fat Man"" and Bogey is still the hard boiled realist.  The difference to the MF is that instead of a Dashiel Hammet derivative detective story, this one is based on themes from what was the classic story of the early years of Nazi history - the transit visa.  That was the holy grail that meant survival to millions who fled between 1932 and when the borders closed shortly after the fall of Paris.  From this perspective, Ricks actions can be seen not so much as noble self denial but the hard reality that in such times the problems of two lovers ""don't amount to a hill of beans.""",Casablanca

""Rick's American Cafe"" is as classic and memorable of a setting as perhaps the library in The Breakfast Club or the resteraunt in My Dinner With Andre. Me and my fiancée have even gone to the extremes of emulating/replicating Rick's Cafe in the Sims games.This place is a little piece of glamor and refuge away from the troubled north-African continent. People flock to Casablanca to get hooked up with transport to the USA, most of them escaping WW2 ravaged Europe. It's a cultural epicenter. The Nazis understand the town's significance and use it to exercise their influence on the region. They work together with the local French authority to maintain the flow of people (more notably, money) through this port to the western world.Things go a little haywire when a wanted Czech resistance leader decides to show up at Rick's café. With this resistance leader, is the woman Rick has been drowning himself in booze over for years. He becomes drawn to her, and struggles with the task of sticking his neck out for her (and her friend, who has the Nazis on his trail).That's pretty much it.In-between all of the plot twists and sparkly-stuff, there's a few characters you actually care about. There's a setting as classic and campy as only this period of cinema could provide. Bogart is the man, he's one of the biggest on screen bad-asses I've seen in awhile.",Casablanca

But Bogart's old lover has come back with Henreid. And she's played by Ingrid Bergman.Bogart is very surprised and it brings back many old memories. He wants to have her back, but he knows that she belongs with Henreid because those transit letters are for them. But will he let her get away again? That's the decision he must make at the end. And it's a very powerful ending. The story for this film is incredible. And it wasn't finished until the end of production. So know one knew the end of the movie. That makes it all more realistic. And gives Michael Curtiz, who directed the film, another reason to get that oscar.
Ingrid Bergman gives the best performance of her career and one of the greatest performances ever.

391,Paul-250,Overwrought Wartime Romance,4,15 May 1999,"Am I the only person not to like this film, or just the only one (almost) to say so? At the time it was made, it was put together in a rush by a whole group of different scriptwriters, with most of the people involved in the film seeing it as nothing special. I agree with them! I found it generally trite and predictable. Almost everything about this film is artificial - the setting, the plot and the ending, as is normally the case in wartime propaganda films hastily put-together or not. The person whose fate we are supposed to care about is presented one-dimensionally, whilst the characteristic which defines Bogart for what he is (hard-bitten worldly cynicsym) is the characteristic he will have to lose if the film is to have a schmaltzy ending. What is his real motivation? Why does he do the things he does? There is really no character development at all. Does he believe in ideals and if he does do they have to be other people's? Or is he just chivalrous, or even whimsical or perverse? At a time when the British Empire was close to exhaustion and millions had died in Russia and central Europe, there is a little too much of the lone American saving the conscience of the world about it for comfort. Of course, the makers of the film only ever intended to make a simple propaganda film and they did their job well.They gave the audience the Bogey they wanted and were suitably rewarded with affection from more than one generation of filmgoers. But this is not a serious film, whatever Woody Allen may think.",Casablanca
392,Sisiutil,"A film that gets better with age (mine, that is)",10,26 December 2001,"It's hard to think of something new to contribute to the commentary on one of the best-loved and most-discussed of all films. But my affection for Casablanca prompts me to try.I watch the film about once every two years, and every time I get something more out of it--maybe because I'm a little older each time. It strikes me as a very adult film, as opposed to most of the movies put out today that seem aimed at the 14-year-old in all of us. As time goes on, I find myself relating more and more to Rick and Renault: cynical, world-weary, but bemused by the folly around them and content as long as they're left alone. That is, until events conspire to present them with a choice: abandon completely any ideals you may have once held, or take a stand for them.Rick's choice, his solution, is one that most of us hope we would have the courage and nobility to make. And what a brave choice for a Hollywood movie to make: the hero doesn't get the girl! Instead, he gets back his soul. Casablanca dares to say something that few artists or politicians in our self-centred, post-WWII age are willing to say: that sacrifice can be more important, more worthwhile, even more satisfying, than reward.Granted, Casablanca may not be the best film ever made. The Godfather, Schindler's List, and Citizen Kane are, doubtless, ""greater"" films, more important films. Mention them to a film buff and you'll get an astute, respectful nod. But mention this one and you'll get a delighted smile.",Casablanca
393,ThreeThumbsUp,Boring...,3,13 September 2010,"Let me start by saying that I understand the allure of this film. It's a classic. I get that. However, I did not find it very entertaining. In fact, I fell asleep toward the end. I have never been a fan of black and white movies, and this is exactly why. The storyline moved quite slowly with very little action. The acting was predictable and hollow. The love story seemed rushed. You never get the sense that the two really cared about each other while courting in Paris. In conclusion, I would not recommend this film to anyone who isn't a true film buff as those are the only people that can really appreciate a picture like this.",Casablanca

That being said, he does it very well, and it is still endearing to watch (although these movies have to be spaced out by other movies otherwise it really does become soul-sucking.""

395,DrewAlexanderR1,Timeless,10,2 August 2015,"Almost 75 years later and Casablanca still contends with the best of them. Movies you've seen in the past five years fade from memory while Casablanca will forever stick in your mind. It is the epitome of a classic and will never be outdated. Casablanca tells the story of an American ex-pat night club owner, Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), during the early days of World War II in unoccupied Africa. While following his usual tact of lying low his ex lover, Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), shows up at his gin joint in Casablanca with her current lover, underground leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). The film expertly relays subtleties of the War and depicts the disarray that ensues following the appearance of two letters of transit. Nazi Major Henreich Strasser arrives in Casablanca for this reason following Lazlo and the police Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains) does what he can please the Major but always looks to help himself. Things escalate from here, and Casablanca continues to be one of the most memorable films to date. Skeptics see a release date of 1942 and a film that touts black and white cinematography. But for most this film will always be viewed as one of the best and considered timeless.",Casablanca

397,silva-w-pius,"As time goes by, the film will still suck!",6,1 August 2014,"WARNIG! Don't watch Casablanca because you will regret it, ""Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon and for the rest of your life.""The biggest travesty and atrocity a kid could ever be inflected with, is when you're given the crushing blow that Santa is not real. Well take that dreadful feeling and then multiply it by a thousand, and you might just be able understand the heart wrenching pain that I felt after so many years of eager anticipation to watch supposedly one of the greatest films of all time, only to find out the hard way upon watching Casablanca, that the film doesn't live up to anywhere close to all the hype surrounding it. Trust me finding that Rudolf, the elves and Santa workshop didn't exist was a walk in the park compared to this! 1941 was in the grips of a deadly second world war, but while the rest of Europe was going up in flames, Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) was living it up in the sun, sea and sand of Morocco where he remained entirely neutral whilst cozying it up in a nightclub and gambling den in Casablanca. But trouble is at foot as the Germans come looking for a famous Czech Resistance fugitive leader by the name of Victor Lazio. But then to shovel another tone onto Ricks plate; ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine."" The love of his life Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) that once broke his heart returns to cause trouble again. Okay so what's wrong with it, gosh there is so much to point out, I'm going dizzy just thinking about it. Now I'm sat down, let me make it easier for myself, what's good about it...umm well? I'm stumped, I've literally scratched my head so much, I think I've left myself with a bald patch. The first blatant criticism is the rotten acting that leaves a wretched smell in the air and horrible unsavoury taste in the mouth. Like come on if I wanted to see such wooden performance I would go to a Shakespeare in the park where all the character are played by actual trees! Imagine how many times in the entire film did Rick ever show even a flicker of emotion in the film, the answer is (drum roll please) zero, cero and null. But this ain't an episode of who wants to be a millionaire and I'm not Terry Crews, so don't be expecting any cash prizes. Instead from Rick all you get is one long continuous monotone delivery of each and every line, which unfortunately to my ears sounds similar to a heart monitor flat lining. But don't think for a moment that Ilsa will resuscitate the morbid desolation that becomes of Casablanca at the hands of Rick. Because Ilsa has the habit of always turning smiles upside down, her character has no backbone and merely sways back and forth between both Lazio (Husband) and Rick like she were a hula skirt in the wind anytime she sees fit. In the entire film I'm pretty sure she doesn't have a single thought in the film that doesn't involve either one of the two men. However on a good note, while the acting was crummy, the words coming from their mouths were surprisingly rather good. I've used quite a few quotes from the film in my review because the dialogue in Casablanca was clever, witty and enjoyable to hear and thus quite right the scriptwriter pair of the Epstein brothers and Howard Koch received Oscar recognition for their exploits. Also what I do applaud is the way Michael Curtiz weaves into the film the ethos of always having the courage to resist and triumphing against whatever evil the world may try to put in your way. Anytime you see inside of Rick's bar it is constantly brimming with joy and happiness, which is a refreshing sight to witness when you consider that above all their heads is suffocating Nazi shaped black cloud. The best illustration of this is in the scene where Victor he spurs the customers in Rick's cafe to a deifying yet beautiful rendition of Marseillaise, effectively drowning out the chorus of Nazis singing. But don't confuse my compliments with me softening up to Casablanca, the film still sucks!",Casablanca
398,judemcrobbie,The ultimate romance movie.,9,2 March 2021,"Does it live up to the hype? Probably not, but I don't think it physically could have with its larger than life status. Nonetheless it was actually insanely memorable with some of the most iconic lines in all of cinema:
It is the epitome of great acting combined with great writing and then topped off with great direction. The subtleties throughout and the memorable lines are what make this movie. The little headnods to resent the German army to the final line are special. All through the movie the two leads, bogart and Bergman, bounce off each other radiantly with the likeable charisma necessary to a romance movie. Not to say they don't excel with the rest of the cast with some of the best moments.
Rick has one of the most powerful arcs in all of fiction instead of the usual romance ending, sacrificing that in the choice of the war, the other characters feeling and ultimately friendship.
Rick's character clearly has something up with him as he is so cynical throughout the first act and then ultimately the revelation of character comes through perfectly in a sort of 'of course' manor.
The world building in this is jaw dropping considering that about 90% takes place in a bar. Just from the embedded exposition we can understand the time, the magnitude of the war and all the moments happening around the bar.
Casablanca is a timeless movie, despite it's obvious dated cinematography and its square framing and grainy, because of the compelling narrative woven throughout keeping us on our toes and then the ending being a cinematically crafted masterpiece like the rest of the movie as the rising action, however what sets the final scene apart is how it is incapaulated story in itself. You could probably watch it by itself and still feel the tension as the stakes feel so real.

399,pitsburghfuzz,A Masterpiece,10,18 May 2009,"Casablanca, according to AFI, is the 3rd greatest film, number 1 most passionate, and 37th most thrilling. Personally my favorite movie. Casablanca starts out with the death of two Germans carrying exit visas, the key for someone in Casablanca to go to Lisbon then the Americas. We then enter Rick's Cafe American, where most of the story takes place. Ugate(Lorre)told Rick(Bogart) about the two exit visas that were stolen and needed Rick to hold them for a few hours. Capt. Renault(Reins) speaks with Rick about the exit visas. He informs him about Victor Laszlo(Henreid) and his wife(Bergman) that they need to go to America to spread the news about Europe. Rick doesn't care until he meets and finds out that Laszlo's wife was Ilsa Lund, his lover in France that left him. Now, he must choose between his feelings, or the countless lives that hang in the balance. Casablanca carries such great performances such as Sydney Greenstreet, Dooley Wilson, Conrad Veidt, and many more. This movie went through some major trouble while being made with the script and it won an Oscar for best screenplay. Overall, movies like this aren't made anymore. It touches you forever. After you watch this film, it is just the beginning of a beautiful friendship as time goes by.",Casablanca
400,amufan,Old does not mean Classic...but in this case,9,15 April 2019,"Below is the review I Wrote when I watched this movie for the first time, a couple of years later I decided to give it another try because I found myself really enjoing movies from the 30s to the 60s. I'm not sure what happened the first time I watch this movie perhaps I just wasn't tuned in to the genre and the time period, But whatever the reason I now see what almost everyone else sees this movie truly is a classic of its time, I still don't think the acting is anything but slightly above average but the dialogue is very good and so is the plot, I think the The lesson I learned is some movies need a second chance because sometimes when we watch a movie for the first time we go in watching it for certain expectations so our mind is not open So what we are seeing. I highly suggest anyone who watch this movie only wants and didn't like it to understand the time period in which these movies were made, they couldn't rely on CGI special effects big action they had to rely on good writing good acting and a good plot.First review:I love movies and I don't care when a movie was made, I rate them on its substance. I don't understand people who say ""it's a good movie for it's time"". What? The time is now and u rate the movie at the time u watch it. And if it a movie loses something for you over time then that says a lot about the movie. So say u watch a movie when you are s teenager and you live it, but then watch the same movie in your 40s and think the movie is horrible, most likely the movie is horrible you just didn't know any better when you were a teenager.Sorry but Casablanca is slow, boring and the dialogue is terrible. Now maybe the problem with most the older movies is the didn't have a lot of money put Into production, so every movie is like watching a play on the big screen. They relied heavily on dialogue, charcter development and good acting. Casablanca fails on all of these.",Casablanca

After watching it last night I remembered what made me a movie fan in the first place.  Movies like Casablanca.  I was astounded with how influential this picture was.  I knew Raiders of the Lost Ark was inspired by the old Saturday Afternoon Serials, but I had NO IDEA how much it had taken from ""Casablanca.""  The shots, the cinematography, the staging of characters, even the clothing.  So many movies were inspired by this film (some were direct rip-offs).

The acting is brilliant. Peter Lorre, Dooley Wilson, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt, Paul Henreid and Ingrid Bergman are all fantastic, but none compete with Humphrey Bogart. The best word to describe his character, Rick, is simply...cool. Rick is the embodiment of cool, and Bogart plays him incredibly. How he did not win Best Actor for this movie, I do not understand.There are so many powerful and fantastic scenes in this movie, it's difficult to list them all. I love the anthem showdown, Rick meeting Ilsa again for the first time in years, Sam playing the piano for a drunken and depressed Rick, and especially the ending. This is probably the most moving ending in cinema history. There are also so many great lines in this movie. My heart skips a beat every time I hear ""Here's looking at you, kid"", ""We'll always have Paris"", the ""Play it Sam"" lines, the ""hill of beans"" line, ""kiss me as if it were the last time"", ""maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow..."", ""I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"", etc.I don't think there has ever been better movie chemistry than that of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.

The wonderful acting,story and location work really gave the film something magical that puts it in the group of Gone With The Wind and The GodfatherIn the early years of World War II, the Moroccan city of Casablanca attracts people from all over. Many are transients trying to get out of Europe; a few are just trying to make a buck. Most of them -- gamblers and refugees, Nazis, resistance fighters, and plain old crooks -- find their way to Rick's Café Américain, a swank nightclub owned by American expatriate Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart). Though we learn later that Rick once harboured enough idealism to put himself at risk to fight fascism, he's now embittered and cynical, professing to be neutral and detached: ""I stick my neck out for nobody.""What i love about this film is Humphrey Bogart. His ability to put himself firmly in a role and believe in it is extraordinary. I think Rick Blaine is one of the most cool and charming characters on the screen. Ilsa is also a true beauty on the screen. You can really feel for the love between Rick & Ilsa and how they will die for each other if it became possible. But in the end, their love can conquer all only not together and that is one of the most touching scenes in cinema when they have their final conversation.The ending stands out as one of the best in Cinema.

413,hokiemo,First Rate in every way,9,10 July 2006,"The film revolves around the lives of WWII refugees who use Casablanca as means of getting out of war torn Europe and into the United States. Humphrey Bogart is excellent as the cafe owner Rick and Ingrid Bergman superb as Ilsa, Rick's old lover who abandoned him in Paris without explanation, and then shows up in Casablanca with her husband. The script is well written and the dialogue flows effortlessly and believably between characters. Ingrid Bergman brings a fantastic amount of complexity to her character's emotions and the mystery surrounding her true feelings for Rick is smartly never fully resolved. Even when Ilsa claims she thought her husband was dead and that's why she had an romance with Rick, I'm not sure I believe her. Ilsa, whether its out of guilt or love, desperately wants to get her husband Victor Laszlo out of Casblanca and on his way to the USA. The Germans are trying to keep Laszlo in Casablanca indefinitely due to his anti-war activities. Claude Rains as Captain Renault is wonderful and leaves a indelible mark in cinema history for his witty retorts throughout the film.

417,quatermax-1,More than the sum of its parts...,10,7 February 2008,"CASABLANCA of course needs no introduction, being hailed by many as one of the finest movies ever made, albeit accidentally. I have to say it's been many years since I watched it and I'd forgotten just how good it is. The dialogue is slick, witty and economical and has rightly, with allegedly a little rephrasing from Bogart, spawned some of the most quoted lines in movie history. I lost count of the number of frivolously double-edged and charmingly barbed lines delivered by Rains' Capt. Renault, to whom everyone is a target at the beginning of the movie, almost as if he were unsure of exactly whose side he was on, which is most likely the case as the script was constantly being re-doctored and changed during filming. Even Bergman, who was already preoccupied with the prospect of her next film, FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, had to ask which guy she was meant to be in love with. With the typical ambiguity evident in the rest of the production, she was told to 'play it down the middle'. In fact none of the actors had any more idea of how the whole thing was going to end than the audience did on first viewing.Everything that makes CASABLANCA a great film seems to have been by happy accident. Originally cast in the three lead roles were Ronald Reagan, Ann Sheridan and Dennis Morgan. Doesn't bear thinking about does it? Thankfully they were unavailable. The now classic 'As Time Goes By' was an established hit that was specified in the original play, but score composer Max Steiner (KING KONG, GONE WITH THE WIND) tried hard to have it replaced by one of his own compositions. Bergman however had by this time had her hair cropped for FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS, which made it impossible to reshoot the necessary scenes (at least that's what they told Steiner). As it is, as the NFT said in 1974, 'the sum of all its many marvelous parts far exceeds the whole'.",Casablanca

While it is certainly still enjoyable and contains a heart-rending love story, there are some aspects of Casablanca that relegate it to a less lofty pedestal in my opinion.Before considering my specific criticisms, bear with me while I go over some historical context. America had avoided entry into World War II in 1939 while Europe was overrun by the Nazi menace. By June 1940, Hitler had occupied Paris. In December 1941, the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor and the US declared war on them as well as their German allies. The day after the Japanese attack, production began on Casablanca. It was intended to be a patriotic gesture at its release in 1942. No surprise then that the Academy so enthusiastically handed out its top Oscars to this film. It was the right film at the right time.The first third of the movie is the most problematic from my perspective. These are mostly the establishing shots that are intended to give the moviegoer a feel for Casablanca and Rick's Café Americain. I found the dialog, acting and photography below par in this segment. Presented as a series of brief tableaux, the dialog is stilted and unrealistic, betraying its origins as an unproduced stage play. The photography in this portion and in some other segments (e.g., the Marseillaise vs. Nazi song battle) were clearly posed to capture a ""perfect"" moment. I found it jarring - other films of the era had abandoned this sort of interlude decades earlier. The model airplane used in several scenes instead of a real one was laughably bad.After the introduction, Casablanca picks up steam and moves to a satisfying conclusion. Odd because neither of them really wanted to be in it, the extraordinary onscreen chemistry between Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart is undeniable. So much so that Bogart's wife accused him of having an on set affair with his co-star. There are also many brilliant performances by other classic actors. But the unrequited love story is of course the true heart of the film. If you don't at least mist up in the final scene, you'd better see a cardiologist. Recommended.",Casablanca
421,MacBalthus,THE Hollywood romance itself!,9,23 December 2006,"This movie can compete with the most famous and timeless love stories in history, like Romeo & Julia, the beauty and the beast, Julia Roberts and Richard Geere.Always remember while you watch it: 1942. Not such a nice time for the world! Not such a nice time for romance. Not such a nice time to stand up against something. It must have been quite an effort to shoot this film during such harsh times. I mean, it's quite a political movie and the scene with the Marseillaise must have been a punch in the face of every fascist.But all the political quarrels are combined with an amazing love story that hasn't lost a single ounce of its attraction or beauty throughout the years.But what really made a classic out of the picture is, in my opinion, Humphrey Bogart. I consider him the man of the millennium, a guy with so much masculine attitude and yet so much feeling. It's just an eye-catching experience to see him walk and talk and, most impressive, drink. Any other actor drinks quite ordinary. It's not a big deal to empty a glass of booze. But when Bogie does it, you can feel his pain. You can feel his grief and his anger. You can feel the person behind the scene. If you ask me for the man I respect the most in movie history, it has to be Humphrey Bogart.Sure, the rest of the cast does a great job as well, Ignrid Bergmann is responsible for half of the chemistry between Rick and Ilsa but well, I can only see them in the shadow of Bogie.This is one of those movies, you hear so much talking about and you begin to ask what's so great about a dusty old flick, but after you've watched it, you realize what everybody was talking about. At least, that's how I did.A truly timeless tale about romance with the perfect cast and probably the most memorable quotes in history. Terrific!",Casablanca
422,A-Good-Fella,Iconic masterpiece.,10,21 October 2021,"Out of all the black and white classics that i've seen, Casablanca was one of the best (close with Psycho, It's a wonderful life,
Citizen Kane and To kill a mockingbird). The fact that this movie is from 1942 blows my mind, it's one of the roughest years ever, due to the war and the pearl harbor attack. So it's so impressive a movie of this caliber was released in the same year. It's extremely well made and every scene is so detailed and well thougt out, brilliant cinematography.The cast is amazing and they all deliver excellent performances, especially Humphrey Bogart who proves why he's called one of the greatest ever. I have to mention that some of the cast are real nazi refugees and the fact that they were able to create a masterpiece is mindblowing because it's literally a movie created during the war, about the war and it's made with people from the war, stunning stuff.The screenplay is where this movie truly stands out, Casablanca's got some of greatest dialogue in cinema history and it's probably THE most quottable movie ever made.Casablanca is a simple but brilliant story of a man who is willing to sacrifice the thing he loves most for ""The greater good"".It's is a true icon for all of film industry and a must watch for all film lovers because it's not just the best and most infuential romance ever, it's one of the greatest and most admirable movies ever made.10/10.",Casablanca
423,dfwesley,One of the greatest wartime love stories,10,28 December 2016,"A ten score if there ever was one! It is difficult to say anything that hasn't already been said about this classic. Humphrey Bogart was in his early forties when CASABLANCA was made, but this kind of romance is ageless. Ingrid Bergman couldn't have been more attractive.No man could have been more love smitten than Rick, and he finds solace in the bottle and the ballad, AS TIME GOES BY. This movie and that song are inseparably intertwined to many viewers.Claude Rains heads a fine supporting cast. As Captain Renault, he walks a fine line between disrespect and reluctant obedience in dealing with the Nazis. His whimsy and humor are just a pleasure. Paul Henried is quite subdued in comparison.Many of the one liners are well known. One of my favorites is, "" He's like all men, only more so."" Figure that one out. At the very end, ""This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" leaves you with a warm, positive feeling.Oh, I have some trivial comments about CASABLANCA. Nobody is ever seen eating in the CAFE AMERICAINE. Perhaps all the action took place after 10 pm.There never was a more desolate airport in the final scene. Only one airplane and not a single person around. Neither do Rick and the captain seem in any particular hurry in leaving, after Strasser was shot. Surely the Nazis would soon be in hot pursuit.Do they make them like this anymore? I don't think so. This is one that no one should miss, young or old.",Casablanca
424,Parca,The most overrated film of all time,1,22 October 1998,"Style?  What style?  This had no style, and the script was one cheesy line after the other.  It is the perfect soap opera, it fooled people to believe it is more than what it is.  And aside from Bogart and Bergman, the cast was overacting to an extreme. It all feels Disneyesque, with a touch of musical wannabe.  Also, I can't help but laugh at the special effects involved in this film, and the bad editing at times.  Talk about hurrying a film's production...Don't get me wrong.  I've enjoyed ""The Godfather"", the ""Star Wars"" trilogy, ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Citizen Kane"", ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""A Bridge on the River Kwai"", anything by Stanley Kubrick, and many others that are on the alleged ""classics"" list.

425,Sonic_Ocean,"Heartwarming in all the right places, Casablanca deserves every ounce of its iconic status in the world of cinema",8,19 July 2013,"As a child, I fondly remember watching the a Looney Tunes short which was a homage/parody to Casablanca, named Carrotblanca. I didn't think much of it, but it greatly gave me an idea of how iconic Casablanca was and knowing of Humphrey Bogart. Fast-forward to adulthood and now I've finally watched it and seen what the fuss was about.Did it live up to the hype? I think so, but as I was watching it, I was starting to think I might not really like the movie by the time it ends. When things were getting too sentimental, my cynical side was cringing, but then once the story opened up more, I began to see that the story was addressing themes of love and virtue that we all can relate to as human beings. It's the two things that make a human being human and we as human beings know that those two things may require things of importance of us to be sacrificed and that can be either good or negative. It's a character study of one person's struggle with those two ideals.What I love about Casablanca is that it is not at all cynical, but at the same time it's not all sunshine and rainbows. What it does have, most importantly, is a lot of heart and it is a film that can remind us all of our humanity in that we're all susceptible to our vulnerabilities to the people we cherish the most and that could potentially destroy us, but Casablanca finds triumph in that and asks each and everyone of us to find triumph in our adversities for the sake of keeping our hearts pure. Any film that asks something like that is a film that is sure to be remembered and to remain in the hearts of not only people looking for entertainment in movies, but also heart. And that is what makes Casablanca a pure classic, in my opinion.",Casablanca
426,Don Muvo,Everything that Hollywood should be,10,4 July 2003,"I can't see what to write here, since so many people will be moved by this film and write something about their experience in seeing it, often time after time, ""As Time Goes By"". This is a freeze frame of American war propaganda at its highest point, with an array of America's greatest filmmakers collaborating at the beginning of World War II, right after the attack on Pearl Harbor. It is a work that will always be seen and be honored as the epitome of world film-art that it is. Don't take anything for granted when you watch this movie. It all has to do with time, place, and character. It's so easy to get embroiled in one or two of the character's performances that you'll miss half of the film.

429,ACitizenCalledKane,One of the greatest motion pictures of all time!,10,22 December 2004,"When Michael Curtiz' film, Casablanca, left Warner Bros. studio and hit the silver screen in 1942, it was intended to be a well-received box-office success. It had a star-studded cast, a fine director, and very talented writers. What more does a film need to be successful? Needless to say, Casablanca more than surpassed all expectations. It won three Academy Awards (Best Director, Picture, and Screenplay) in 1943. That, in of itself, is impressive for a movie that was produced in much the same way as about fifty-one other pictures that were produced by Warner Bros. that year. Granted, this movie did have a lot going for it, but there was some confusion during the making of it, like, trying to decide on an ending, for example. The ending was a last-minute thought by the writers, and so Ingrid Bergman was likely just as surprised to hear it as her on-screen persona, Ilsa. The ending, like the entire film, has, of course gone down in movie history as being one of the more memorable endings of all time. In retrospect, all of the honors and success that Casablanca received was nothing in comparison to the impact that it has had ever since it came out.As for the movie itself, what can be said about Casablanca that hasn't already been said? It is an extraordinary film. It is entertaining and powerful. It won't dazzle you with ""avant-garde cinematic expression"" or Freudian references. It is simply a well-crafted movie. Plain and simple. Michael Curtiz oversaw the making of one of the highlights of American cinema. The writing was exceptional, with humor sprinkled in between drama, romance, action, suspense, etc. The performances in Casablanca, though, are a joy to behold. Humphrey Bogart's bitter, vulnerable Rick is easily one of his greatest achievements, while Ingrid Bergman was more beautiful than ever as Ilsa, Rick's love interest. Paul Henreid supplies Ilsa's husband, Victor, with a dignity that makes him as honorable as any screen hero I've ever seen. Claude Rains gives a typically wonderful performance as the corrupt Captain Renault, who respects Rick, but must answer to Major Strasser (played by Conrad Veidt at his most sinister), a Nazi sent to Casablanca to find Victor. Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre contribute small, but equally important and memorable characters, as Ferrari and Ugarte, respectively. Last, but certainly not least, is Dooley Wilson, who brought a warm sincerity to this movie that was just as powerful as any other emotion on display during the film.It just doesn't get much better than this. I have recommended this film to everyone I have met who has missed out on this wonderful film. It has it all, and if you have not seen Casablanca, do yourself a favor, and see it now!",Casablanca
430,evancyl,Undoubtedly one of Hollywood's greatest love stories,10,17 August 2014,"As the much-vaunted greatest Hollywood movie on love, Casablanca didn't quite fit my expectations but it was superb! I was expecting a whirlwind romance between characters brought together by adversity and one character making a sacrifice for them to stay together. But no. While the romance and sacrifice elements were present, the premises and outcome are totally different. In the early years of WWII, Rick (Humphrey Bogart) runs a very successful restaurant-cum-bar in Casablanca, neutral French territory where Europeans pay a fortune for exit papers to get to America. One day, his former lover Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) appears, with her husband political activist Victor Laszlo. Rick and Ilsa had a whirlwind romance some years back in Paris but she disappeared on the day they were supposed to depart together, leaving only a note of apology and a devastated Rick. Ilsa is determined to help her husband escape from the Nazis, but decides to stay behind with Rick. Although it comes at some cost to himself, Rick does what he feels is best for her, in the spirit of true love.The acting, the script, the soundtrack, were all splendid. The story and message were powerful, definitely more so than the Titanic, as much as I liked that movie. Everyone should watch this!",Casablanca

From location, to music, to just the overall incredibly coolness that the movie just exudes, Casablanca is a timeless classic that will still be perfect hundreds of years from now.

The acting is superb from all those involved, though the absolute cool of Humphrey Bogart and the sheer beauty of Ingmar Bergman working together is probably a highlight.But more then anything, it is the incredible script that really needs to be mentioned. I have yet to see a film that can maintain the level of satisfaction from the barrage of instantly classic one-liners that's offered here, and there is such a wide variety of fantastic characters that make this such a gem.If you want to see a 40's film that really shows the quality of the work during that time, then Casablanca is the perfect place to start.",Casablanca

It struggles to innovate, to inspire us, and to tell a story that ""everyone"" can stand behind. Casablanca came at a time, when the world was imploding unto itself. The movie mirrored life at the time. A world war. People split apart by this war. Nations and their people forced to choose what they believe in order to survive. In summary, a disruption of the life everyone knew. Rick and his cafe summarized alittle bit of what this world had become. A story with many stories interwoven inside it. Mystery. Intrigue. Love. Nationalism. It is all mixed together in this realistic storyline. Classics are made because they touch people on a different level than most films. Hollywood outdid itself with this movie.

438,selfparody,Boy... was I disappointed to the point of mad,3,29 May 2005,"This movie, frankly, does not deserve its high ranking. The plot, such as it is, is that Rick is trying to run a cafe in Casablanca, refugee zone, where Victor Laslo and his spouse Ilsa, a former lover of Rick, show up during World War 2. Victor must get out, but Rick, who has accidentally gotten some papers of transit (which are widely known to be a nonsense concept in reality) Somehow, Victor's got to get those papers, and we're supposed to be entertained by a lot of people just standing around trying to be witty, and often (except Claude Rains a few times) falling flat on their face. This has got to be the worst possible way to approach a story about World War Two. It's about a LOVE STORy, and, of course, a Hollywood type where affairs are justified so long as the parties are attractive enough. No real explorations into what was going on at the time are made, and frankly, the ""All Nazis Are Bad, But We Allies Can't Help But Be Good."" stance frankly was old by then: it's TRIUMPH OF THE WILL reversed only not as well made. I mean, yes the Nazi Party was the most blatantly evil in existence (maybe the Japanese one was as bad if you study what happened in China) but that doesn't mean every nazi was ready to shoot at a moment's notice, and not every officer a more arrogant version of Colonel Klink.

439,ppilf,"A Classic - great acting, directing, dialog & music - but has bad story flaws",9,4 March 2015,"Like all movie fans, I love the movie Casablanca. It's in the top 15 of my list of favorite movies. It is truly a classic. Its great actors, director, music, dialog, and romance arouse deep emotion. According to the film's makers, Casablanca was one of those amazing unexpected successes that fate occasionally surprises us with. Apparently no one involved in making this movie expected it to be the famous classic it became. Reportedly, some of the actors and film makers nearly turned it down because the script just seemed like another unremarkable war movie. What I find amazing is that it is set in late 1941, less than a year before it was written, filmed, edited and released; long before World War 2 even ended. Some reports claim it was a propaganda film; not sure that's true.Casablanca contains two scenes that are among favorites of mine. The scene in which Ilsa and Laszlo first meet Sam and Rick in Rick's nightclub. And the scene in which Laszlo tells the nightclub orchestra to play the French national anthem to counter a group of Nazi officers loudly singing a patriotic German song; all the patrons then join in singing the French anthem, totally drowning out the Nazis. The emotion aroused by these and many other scenes in this film attest to the talent of the director, actors, film editors, music composers, and production staff.But, although Casablanca is a very moving experience that captivates its audience, its story plot and subplots have very bad faults, at some points downright absurd. These are known among critics, authors, and even war historians. I'm a terrible stickler for detail by nature and I can't help but absorb all aspects of a movie. I consider these story flaws unfortunate because the screenplay is otherwise beautifully written; it won an Academy award. Casablanca also won Academy awards for best picture and best director, all very much deserved. The main criticism with the story is the fictitious ""letters of transit"" which are supposed to be some sort of super passport, and would certainly have to possess supernatural powers to wield the effect and great value depicted in this story. The letters (plural for some reason) play a key role in the plot. There are many flaws in this concept and in the entire story; it really becomes ridiculous at points. So, being the admitted (nearly anal?) stickler for detail that I am, I've actually listed some of those flaws below for anyone interested:1) First, of course, there's no such thing as letters of transit, never has been. It would seem that a simple forged passport or visa would be a better travel authorization in 1941 unoccupied Morocco.2) If there were such documents, they could easily be revoked and made useless, just as any document can, and just as governments routinely do with passports that are reported lost or stolen. The purported rareness of these letters, which is supposed to make them so ridiculously valuable, would actually make them much more a risk and a red flag in travel rather than an aid (unless they cause inspectors and soldiers to go into magical trances).3) Suppose the far-fetched premise is true that these letters are worth over 200,000 francs in 1941 (about $100,000 in today's U.S. dollar). One could easily have them forged for far less. Passports and exit visas are being forged throughout this movie. If government passports can be forged, with their special paper, cryptic engravings and invisible watermarks, then letters and signatures can easily be forged.4) Again, assume the letters really are that valuable. You'll realize, as I think everyone watching this movie realizes, Ugarte's dumb assumption that by handing the letters temporarily over to Rick somehow safeguards these valuable papers, is absurd. Ugarte could protect them a thousand times better by simply burying them or hiding them in a bush or under an old shed. And savvy Rick would certainly know this. But of course it's important to the story plot for Rick to possess these magic letters. As for Rick's piano hiding place, a 10 year old kid could find a more secure place.5) Lastly (but not least), Rick's plan proposed to Renault is nonsense. He tells Renault to release Laszlo from petty charges so Rick can lure him into buying the transit letters. Renault is then supposed to arrest Laszlo and turn him over to the Nazis who can then supposedly imprison Laszlo for many years for the serious crime of possessing the letters. In the meantime Rick and Ilsa will be on the plane to Lisbon, using the omnipotent transit letters for travel. What's wrong with this picture? The absurdity is that Laszlo won't be in possession of the letters, Rick and Ilsa will. How will this incriminate Laszlo? Or are the Nazis going to give the letters back to Rick after Laszlo is in prison so that Ilsa and Rick can flee? Totally absurd. Even Renault would be smart enough to see that.But, again with all of that said, Casablanca's other qualities are so great that they outweigh the drawbacks. It is still a brilliantly directed and beautifully produced classic. It's just a bit of a shame that more time wasn't spent developing a more realistic plot. That would have made it a near perfect film.",Casablanca
440,ayhansalamci,A Unique Film.,10,8 February 2018,"I can say that I feel the air of Casablanca, an exotic and oriental city, when I start to watch this movie which I have delayed until now with great expectation. I used a perfume from Serge Lutens, who was a perfume brand and who made the oriental perfumes, and I started to watch this film. I think it's unnecessary to criticize this film and cut the score. I think the cause is enough for the year. I think this movie, which was shot in the years when the second world war is going on, is the best love movie of all time.

It also has many plot lines, which is no mistake to the directors, because for some of them, it answers them as soon as you see them, it answers them in the middle, it leaves it for the end, or cliff hangs you on with not a single intention for a sequel. Besides, a sequel will destroy it's premise. While many actors are excellent in the supporting cast, Humphrey Bogart is spectacular as the selfish, money loving, one-woman, man, but gets his heart at the end.

I don't disagree with them.But I'd like to add a suggestion to those of you out there who haven't seen this film.  I'd like to tell you HOW to watch it.The people who made this movie didn't think they were producing a masterpiece. Bergman left the shoot disgusted.  The screenwriters were on salary for Warners, writing half a dozen movies a year, and this was just one more.  Bogie was punching the clock in the middle of a workhorse career.So as an audience member, you can't sit down expecting gilded greatness.Don't have a Casablaca party.  Don't watch it on your first date, hoping it will lend that ""Romantic Touch.""  Don't watch it as part of your ""I need to watch the Best 10 movies of all time"" Film School project.Buy this movie on DVD.  Have it at the ready.  And then, one Friday night, when your plans fall through and you find it's 10:30pm and there's nothing on TV that's any good, open a six pack of beer, or pour yourself some wine, and watch this movie in a darkened room.The characters in Casablanca are absolutely devoid of sentimentalism.  Every one of them sees the world without a hint of rose color in their lenses.  As Rick says, ""Three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this big old world.""  If you're in a mood where you understand what he's saying, watch this movie and it will transport you.There is no single movie that deserves to be called the best movie of all time.  Because movies, when all is said and done, don't amount to a hill of beans.  They are meant to entertain us, not for us to worship THEM.But no movie has ever known this fact like Casablanca.
If you watch Casablance this way, with no expectations, with no ""hype,"" you might catch 10 percent of its greatness on one viewing.  And that will be enough to start you on your way.Happy viewing, kid.",Casablanca

For Humphrey Bogart, this was a career defining moment that launched the Bogie mystique. Ingrid Bergman's performance is nothing less than scintillating. The cast of supporting actors and actresses is superlative. This is one of the rare movies that makes the viewer suspend disbelief. Almost everything in the movie is first rate. The editing was superb with no extraneous scenes. There is no fat. It is a movie in which extremes exist and yet there is no contradiction. It is the rarest kind of movie that can be watched a hundred times and yet, one never tires of it. ""Casablanca"" is pure cinema magic that few, if any, movies will ever match. Words cannot reach it. ""Casablanca"" is an experience that one simply has to experience and preferably, at least once, on a big screen. On a scale of one to ten with ten being best, it is an easy one hundred.",Casablanca
446,s_iliya_p,Magnificent in story,8,22 March 2019,"As much as I loved the story, and as much as I respect the great actors in the movie, the actings seemed a bit forced and unrealistic in some scenes; maybe not as good as the movie itself. That said, they still did a great job.What I loved the most about the movie is how characters' personality in the movie are introduced, but not changed as story goes. As if they were rigidly written first, and then the scenes and the storyline were adapted to fit those personalities. Seems easy to understand why this might be the best thing about the movie, not the amazingly depicted cafe, not the fantastic markets, and not even the beautifully played and sang musics.The Paris flash-back in my view was either too short to be of any signifacnt importance, better said, too short for demonstrating any glorious memories, or too long for such an obviously implied back-story and, of course, chemistry and romantic tensions observed in prior and further scenes.The battle of sentimentalism is a never fought one here. This is how well-written the characters are.Thank you for making such a great movie Mr. Curtiz.",Casablanca
447,stephen7272,I bet Hemingway wished he had written it,9,14 April 2013,"Casablanca was designed to encourage the USA into war against Germany in WW2. It failed wholeheartedly, but it didn't matter, the Japs and Hitler invited them in to the fray.It was also a vehicle for the stupendously subservient actress Ingrid Bergman. Her eyes water every time a male performs a miraculous act such as serving a drink or lighting a cigarette, or god forbid singing a national anthem. The use of cigarettes and booze to create an atmosphere is the primary reason why this movie is so detested today. Those habits simply don't gel with the health-conscious viewers of the 21st century. But see past that and the characters in this movie are still absorbing. Asides from Bogie, Claude Rains and Peter Lorre represent people we all know. What is a bit of mystery, is why the movie was not set in Lisbon rather than Casablanca. Lisbon was infamous as the spy capital of the war and was the historical source for Ian Fleming's James Bond romp in Casino Royale(re-located to western France in the book). Perhaps it was because it was already known that the Torch landings were to take place in Morocco.One of my favourite Bogie movies, but only 3rd behind To Have And Have Not and Key Largo. Bacall pairs up so much more effectively with Bogie than Bergman does.",Casablanca
448,Stroheim-3,The Best,10,11 October 1999,"If someone were to ask me my favorite movie of all time, I would be forced to say Casablanca.  I know a lot of people say this, and all the naysayers who have seen it on TV or video may not know what all the hooplah's about. To all of you, let me say: See it on the big screen!!!It is an experience.The acting is impeccable.  It is the best Bogart ever, the best Bergman ever, and the best Raines ever.  The script is part love story, part anti-German sentiment, part film noir.  The dialogue is extremely witty; it's comparable to the other film noir, detective films of the time.The set-up is brilliant.  We have an isolationist American (Bogart), and evil Nazi, and a Frenchman who may or may not be on the side of the Germans. Hmmmmm, that sounds like what actually happened during World War II.  Do you think that means something?  Probably not.The love story aspect is superb.  Bogart is a typical tough-guy (as we like to see), but that is only his exterior.  He has been hurt by women in his past (something we can all relate to) and has become hardened to his emotions (again, the isolationist).For a movie that was filmed without a clue as to how it was going to end, it did pretty well for itself.  In a word: Incredible",Casablanca
449,mrgray83,Here's looking at YOU kid.,10,19 February 2005,"I had heard that phrase quoted on countless warner bros cartoons for countless years, but I never knew it came from Casablanca. And I've made it almost to 22 years old without seeing it. Now that I have I wonder what I was thinking putting it off for so long. Casablanca is a story about a club owner named Rick. He at one time had a love thing going on with a woman who thought that her husband was dead. Upon learning that he is alive she leaves Rick abruptly and tells him that he can never see him again. I'm not gonna go on and on with the story because it just spoils it and plus this is a review not a plot summary. The story is spellbinding, and we have some of the best dialog in the world displayed here for your listening pleasure. I'm a sucker for a film with just overly exceptional dialog.10/10(What else?)

451,SilkTork,Why Does It Work?,10,27 June 2003,"This is a movie so flawed it is in danger of falling apart. Bergman is cold, confused and remote - unconvincing as the woman who dominates the lives of the mysterious and highly respected American Rick Blaine, and the much sought after inspiration of the resistance Victor Laszlo. The Paris sequence is corny and embarrassing producing one of the worse lines in cinema history - ""Was that cannon fire or is my heart pounding?"" Yet this film remains my all time favourite. No matter how many times I see it I'm still moved. I get goosebumps when Laszlo encourages the staff and customers of Rick's to sing La Marseilles in response to the Germans singing. I smile at the jokes. I melt at the supreme sacrifice at the end. I nod knowingly at the references to America's neutral stance in the war. I admire the theme of commitment and sacrifice in a time of stress. And I love the colourful, quickly drawn characters given vivid life by smooth, confident actors such as Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre. Why does it work so well? Is it Bogart in a white suit? Is it the impressionist tour de force opening where every character and every theme is introduced in a fluid journey through Rick's bar? Or is it the totally unpredictable and totally original story-line the conclusion of which could never be guessed, but which feels so right, so heroic, so romantic, so awesome.

452,camelot2302,"A kiss is just a kiss, a sigh is just a sigh....play it again Sam!",9,13 November 2007,"I am staggered that it took me so long to finally get round to watching this movie! Casablanca has always been one of those movies that I've always wanted to see but never got around to it. Now that I have finally watched it, I am sure to be watching it again and again. And ""that song"" is firmly stuck in my head! There's no need to rehash the plot as everyone except me knows all the lines by heart. But let's just say that this movie is definitely a classic and you WILL watch it over and over again.I do have one little gripe though - the movie is slightly tainted by the fact that there are German officers in it and it was made in 1942 - the height of World War II. So I got the feeling there was a little bit of blatant Allied propaganda put in there - the devious Germans and the heroic Resistance, that sort of thing. But saying that, the movie also portrayed the French Vichy regime in a kind of positive light, which I'm sure didn't go down too well with the Free French.But these are just minor points. On the whole, this is an excellent and timeless piece of film-making!Play it again Sam!",Casablanca

454,kdryan,A masterwork for all time...,10,10 November 2004,"There is a scene about halfway through the movie Casablanca that has become commonly known as 'The Battle of the Anthems' throughout the film's long history. A group of German soldiers has come into Rick's Café American and are drunkenly singing the German National Anthem at the top of their voice. Victor Lazlo, the leader of the French Resistance, cannot stand this act and while the rest of the club stares appalled at the Germans, Lazlo orders the band to play 'Le Marseilles (sic?)' the French National Anthem. With a nod from Rick, the band begins playing, with Victor singing at the top of HIS voice. This in turn, inspires the whole club to begin singing and the Germans are forced to surrender and sit down at their table, humbled by the crowd's dedication. This scene is a turning point in the movie, for reasons that I leave to you to discover. As I watched this movie again tonight for what must be the 100th time, I noticed there was a much smaller scene wrapped inside the bigger scene that, unless you look for it, you may never notice. Yvonne, a minor character who is hurt by Rick emotionally, falls into the company of a German soldier. In a land occupied by the Germans, but populated by the French, this is an unforgivable sin. She comes into the bar desperately seeking happiness in the club's wine, song, and gambling. Later, as the Germans begin singing we catch a glimpse of Yvonne sitting dejectedly at a table alone and in this brief glimpse, it is conveyed that she has discovered that this is not her path to fulfillment and she has no idea where to go from there. As the singing progresses, we see Yvonne slowly become inspired by Lazlo's act of defiance and by the end of the song, tears streaming down her face, she is singing at the top of her voice too. She has found her redemption. She has found something that will make her life never the same again from that point on. Basically, this is Casablanca in a nutshell. On the surface, you may see it as a romance, or as a story of intrigue, but that is only partially correct.The thing that makes Casablanca great is that it speaks to that place in each of us that seeks some kind of inspiration or redemption. On some level, every character in the story receives the same kind of catharsis and their lives are irrevocably changed. Rick's is the most obvious in that he learns to live again, instead of hiding from a lost love. He is reminded that there are things in the world more noble and important than he is and he wants to be a part of them. Louis, the scoundrel, gets his redemption by seeing the sacrifice Rick makes and is inspired to choose a side, where he had maintained careful neutrality. The stoic Lazlo gets his redemption by being shown that while thousands may need him to be a hero, there is someone he can rely upon when he needs inspiration in the form of his wife, who was ready to sacrifice her happiness for the chance that he would go on living. Even Ferrai, the local organized crime leader gets a measure of redemption by pointing Ilsa and Lazlo to Rick as a source of escape even though there is nothing in it for him. This is the beauty of this movie. Every time I see it (and I have seen it a lot) it never fails that I see some subtle nuance that I have never seen before. Considering that the director would put that much meaning into what is basically a throw away moment (not the entire scene, but Yvonne's portion) speaks bundles about the quality of the film. My wife and I watched this movie on our first date, and since that first time over 12 years ago, it has grown to be, in my mind, the greatest movie ever made.",Casablanca
455,plsj,Didn't care for it,4,15 July 2002,"This movie is overrated in my opinion and I'm also not one of those teenagers who has a short attention span. A movie does not have to be loaded with sex or violence for me to enjoy it. Now to the movie. I guess I'm missing something here, I mean the first half of this movie took place in Rick's Bar with people talking and constantly asking for drinks. In fact I've never seen a movie with so many drinks ordered in my life, not that thats bad. After that, I was extremely bored. Surprisingly, I did enjoy Gone With the Wind.My Rating 4/10",Casablanca
456,jn1356-1,The Greatest Movie Ever,10,18 May 2008,"This is it. There is no movie I've ever seen I love like this one. My all-time favorite.In the first place, it is not a huge, earth-shattering epic. It is a tiny little story, about a small handful of people. It doesn't have a life-changing moral. It is merely the most perfectly cut, perfectly polished gem Hollywood has ever produced.Humphrey Bogart is Rick Blaine, the burnt-out American who has found a place to die after his heart has died in Paris. He runs a saloon, living more from force of habit than anything else, and his granite cynicism makes him irresistible to others, men and women. When the love whose loss drove him to such despair returns, his mask cracks, and his agony is so wondrous to see. We get to watch his struggle, and he gives no hints as to his final decision until he announces it at the very end.Ingrid Bergman, as Ilsa, is, clichéd as it is, luminous. She so loves Rick, she so loves her husband. The scene where Victor, her husband, leads that stirring demonstration in Rick's, shows her face full of unadulterated adoration for him. What wouldn't I give to have any woman look at me like that! Her agony is beautiful. We all want her, and all wish we could be either of her heroes.Paul Henreid, Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Conrad Veidt, all gave such performances that they have become stereotypes.But I must pay worshipful tribute to Claude Rains. I think he has the very best lines in the movie. His cheerful cynicism, his unbridled lust, his proud greed, never bowing to the embarrassment of even acknowledging his naked hypocrisy, make him my favorite part of this great movie.This is the only movie I've ever seen I love more each time I see it. There are no great depths to plumb here, no hidden pieces of trivia for aficianadoes to find. Just a very nearly perfect story that is enjoyable time and again.""Who's On First"" is the only comedy routine that is just as funny every time you hear it. ""Casablanca"" is the equally-miraculous movie, just as golden every time you see it, and maybe increasing in value with every viewing.You don't have to know a thing about the time. You don't have to remind yourself, as you do with ""Citizen Kane"", that this is the movie that started all these things. It shines like a star. The perfectly cut, perfectly polished gem of Hollywood.",Casablanca
457,rogerhwerner,Ten Stars Says it all,10,24 July 2021,"This film started life as just another Warner pot boiler. No one involved thought of it as even potentially great. The script writing often progressed from day-to-day and the actors were bit players or not well known character actors. Many of the actors were recently arrived war refugees. Bogart was known for his gangster films where most of the time he dies ignominiously. Ingrid Bergman was largely unknown outside of Sweden and her beauty alone makes the picture worth a view. Today, most critics rank this film as the greatest ever made and I've no doubt they're correct. Much of its dialog has become iconic and has beome part of popular culture. The ending is breathtaking in it's simplicity and it is honestly without equal with one possible exception. I've seen this movie so many times that I've memorized the dialog and it always effects me in a way no other film does. Younger audiences complain about the black and white filmography, often overly dramatic 1940s acting style, and lack sex, violence, car crashes, and explosions. This film, thankfully, is guilty of all these points. Look past the typical triteness of modern cinema and see a film that's almost in a class by itself and has come to define a great movie.",Casablanca

Humphrey Bogart's bar owner cynic is hilarious and pathetic today as he was 55 years ago. Claude Rains's ambiguous little policeman is a delightful caricature.

Usually when I see a movie that is as highly regarded as this, I perversely try to not like it. This one, however, is impossible to dislike. Peter Lorre gives one of the most memorable performances of his career, even though his screen time is roughly four minutes. Claude Rains is at his unflappable best, and has many of the most memorable lines in this film. Humphrey Bogart plays the type of character he does best, the bitter drunk. Ingrid Bergman is absolutely breath-taking, and not in an ugly baby way. I would recommend this to anybody.",Casablanca

But even though nowadays film makers have millions $ and thousands of hi-tech effects to film whatever they want, they should always come to movies like Casablanca to see how great performance can be done just with cleverly chosen music, brilliant acting and dialogues. Of course the movie is dependent on circumstances under which it was made and nobody would believe that things would really happen exactly like that, but the heck with it - it can easily be forgiven. And regarding the fact it was filmed in 40's when the war was far from being finished, the propagandistic aspect of the movie could have been far worse. The atmosphere of the movie is absolutely awesome and I think that nobody can declare himself to be a movie fan unless he saw Casablanca.",Casablanca

Bogart & Bergman were incredible as was the entire cast, I especially love Peter Lorre's rather shortlived role in it.

It is a bit cliqued, but perhaps it was not that way when it was first released, but over the years the lines have been repeated so much that it has become that way. This is a wonderful, complex story, which is one of the things I like about it and other movies with great plots. But it was not too confusing. There were things that I had not noticed on previous viewings, one of which is the use of lighting. I found myself wondering what it meant when they showed Rick's shadow much larger than himself in one scene. Did it mean that he was a mere shadow of himself after Elsa left him alone at the train station? I've never really paid much attention to the beginning scene and realize how it really set the stage for the rest of the film (the mise on scene). It really was quite disturbing how the German invasion impacted all of Europe and all of the refugees were forced to Casablanca. This sort of contrasted with the setting of Rick's-brightly lit, music, drinking. etc. The best scene is when Rick lets the young girl's husband win enough at the Roulette table to buy letters to allow them to leave Casablanca-a real tear jerker",Casablanca

Even Ferrari, the local organized crime leader gets a measure of redemption by pointing Ilsa and Lazlo to Rick as a source of escape even though there is nothing in it for him.But what exactly is so special about it? Is it its great genre mix, never equaled by another film? When we think of 'Casablanca' first, we remember it as a romantic film (well, most of us do). But then again, its also a drama involving terror, murder and flight. One can call it a character study, centering on Rick. And there are quite a few moments of comedic delight, just think of the pickpocket (""This place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere!"") or the elderly couple on the last evening before their emigration to the US (""What watch?"").The film is directed by Michael Curtis, who Warner Brothers brought over from Austria in 1938 to direct Robin Hood. His direction is such that the camera hurtles through the set of Rick's American Cafe with out ever losing breadth or cajole. The editing could be choppy as the film moves at an intensely absorbing & engaging speed pace, but Curtis keeps his pawns in check & the film resumes a kind of kana of perfection. It really is just perfect. There are only hard to find flaws in the dialogue, acting, or camera.So is there a weakest link in 'Casablanca'? Every film, no matter how close to perfection, has a minor flaw or two, so one can find them in 'Casablanca', too, if one really tries hard. So yes, one might ask how much sense the entire mambo jumbo about the letters of transit makes. One might point out that Paul Henreid, although his performance is certainly good, doesn't come close to the greatness of any of his co stars. However, the film is so close to perfection that I'm almost ashamed that I'm so desperately trying to find less-than-perfect elementsBut 'Casablanca' is not only great as a whole, it still stands on top if we break it apart and look at single lines of dialog, scenes or performances alone. Is there any other film which has more quotable dialog than 'Casablanca'? 'Pulp Fiction' is on my mind here, and 'All About Eve' and 'Sunset Blvd.' come close, too, but still I think 'Casablanca' tops everything else. And not only is the dialog great, it's unforgettably delivered, especially by Humphrey Bogart (""I was misinformed."") and Claude Rains (""I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on here""). Many of scenes have become a part of film history; the duel of 'Die Wacht am Rhein' and 'La Marseillaise' is probably one of the greatest scenes ever shot (the only I can think of that would rival it for the #1 spot is Hynkel and the globe from Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator'), and the last scene is probably even familiar to the few people who've never seen 'Casablanca'. Am I the only one who is absolutely convinced that the film wouldn't have become what it is today if Rick and Ilsa would have ended up as the lucky couple?About the performances: So much has been said about the uniqueness of Humphrey Bogart's and Ingrid Bergman's chemistry as Rick and Ilsa, about Claude Rains' terrific turn as Renault, about the scene-stealing performances by Peter Lorre (one of the 10 all-time greatest actors) as Ugarte and Sydney Greenstreet as Ferrari and about Dooley Wilson stopping the show as Sam. I'd love to emphasize here two other performances, one that is not mentioned quite as often and one which is blatantly overlooked: Conrad Veidt as Major Strasser had a really difficult task here, as his character is the only evil one, but still Strasser is not a one-dimensional character, and it took more than 50 years until another actor gave an equally (maybe even more) impressive performance as a Nazi, Ralph Fiennes in 'Schindler's List'. But why no one ever mentions S. K. Sakall, who plays Carl, the jolly waiter at Rick's Café Américain, is beyond me. He has definitely more screen time than Lorre, Greenstreet and Wilson, and probably about as much as Veidt, and he's a joy whenever he's on the screen. I simply love his reaction when the pickpocket (""Vultures everywhere!"") accidentally bumps into him, or the reaction to the ""What watch"" dialogue. Or how he says he gave Strasser the best table, ""being a German, he would have taken it anyway"". His performance is simply criminally overlooked.This is the beauty of this movie. Every time I see it (and I have seen it a lot) it never fails that I see some subtle nuance that I have never seen before. Considering that the director would put that much meaning into what is basically a throw away moment (not the entire scene, but Yvonne's portion) speaks bundles about the quality of the film.

Most of this has to due with context. I had some trouble on the first go around grasping everything that was going on, but I'm not holding any of that against the film.The credit I will give to Casablanca is the dialog is engaging and the cinematography is excellent. The music is perfect and the acting is amazing. It's at this point I even have to ask myself, why didn't I like it? I don't know, I just didn't. It didn't speak to me in the way that lesser films have. It's quite possible that in repeat viewings I'll pick up a detail I missed the first time around and have a renewed appreciation for the film, but as it stands now I respect Casablanca for everything that it is, but I didn't enjoy it and in my eyes that's the most important part of a film, no matter how important it may be historically.",Casablanca

The storyline in so complex but is conveyed in such a simple form. Bogarts character is so round that his emotions and character development is what makes this movie so complex but exhilarating. He starts off being carefree, doesn't care for anyone, Shows no concern towards death or the war and hates just about everyone. He's a true gambler. He's just a bar owner who only cares for himself. But then when he finds his true love the story twists to an entire new perspective and Bogart develops character, just something you have to see. Another exceptional feature to this film is the lighting, some of the darkest scenes are lit so appropriately.

Very good movie.",Casablanca
470,ChristophCinema,11 out of 10 Stars,10,16 October 2012,"What can you say about Casablanca? I'm serious. What can be said about it? It's one of the greatest films of all time and everybody already knows it. This movie is so perfect, that it actually brings tears to my eyes. The acting, the characters, the story, the quotes, the humor, the drama, the atmosphere; everything is just perfect. This is what classics are made of. Picking my favorite thing about this movie is almost impossible because everything goes together hand in hand. But if I had to pick 2 things that make this movie great, it would have to be the two main characters, and the world the movie transports you to. First of all, the two leads. Humphrey Bogart is the man. He's always the man. I've never seen a movie where he wasn't the man. Why is he considered the ""Greatest Actor of All Time""? Because he's Humphrey Bogart, that's why. I think Humphrey Bogart perfected the concept of an ""imperfect hero"". From the very beginning, you see that people would die for him, but he wouldn't do the same. He claims to be neutral, but you're never sure which side he's really on. He's so calm and mysterious, but his decisions are based mostly on his unpredictable emotions. He has such a presence to him, but you're constantly wondering if he'll do the right thing in the end. Ingrid Bergman is also amazing playing opposite of Humphrey Bogart. Just like Bogart, she is very mysterious, and you want to know more about her. She also goes above and beyond the typical 1940s female performance. She gets so into the role, it may actually be the most emotional performance I've ever seen from this time period. These two are just perfect together. I love how most of the movie, we're left in the dark about their relationship. All we know is that these two knew each other at one point, and that they once had something. I love how most of the backstory can be seen in the faces of the two main actors. The movie doesn't even need that flashback scene, because you can see how important these two are to each other just by looking at their faces. The flashback scene is great, but I think it would've been cooler if the whole movie, we didn't know their history together. The last thing that I love about this movie is the world. This movie is classic Hollywood fantasy world, and it sure knows how to suck you right in. This isn't real life, it's the movie world; and that's what makes this movie so classic. Even though it has that 1940s acting, and many of the clichés of the time, it still remains timeless. It's all fun, from beginning to end. You may feel like you're watching a movie, but that's just because you are. This is what movies are all about. They're not about showing us what life is really like; they're about letting us escape to a world where life is more interesting. Like I said, this movie just defines ""classic"". The characters are unforgettable, the scenes are so memorized, and the quotes are so recognizable (it's no wonder this film may be the most referenced/spoofed/quoted film of all time). This film is so perfect, it gets better and better each time I see it. It's so classic; it kind of hurts. So bottom line.it's alright.",Casablanca

I THOUGHT I knew the story. I didn't. I THOUGHT I knew the lines, I did, I THOUGHT I knew the music, and I did, but only when I see this movie over and over do I begin to appreciate Bergman's acting, Bogie's finesse, and Steiner's music. Ever since I saw ""Carrotblanca,"" I remembered that I should really try to see this one. So at the first opportunity, I bought it, watched it that very night, and unlike Doctor Zhivago, this one actually kept me entertained and sympathized with the characters.

475,tony-camel,Outstanding...,10,5 March 2007,"Casablanca is the sort of film that suffers from its reputation. People walk into it expecting to see the greatest film of all time and are disappointed when it doesn't measure up to their own pet faves. But if it doesn't have the depth of some masterpieces, it is certainly among the most entertaining, with a brilliantly witty script, a superb cast and one of the most stirring scenes in all cinema, the so-called Battle Of The Anthems when Laszlo incites Rick's patrons in a recital of La Marseillaise. It also broke social ground, with Sam the pianist (Dooley Wilson) being one of the first black roles to be treated as (almost) an equal. Most of all, it's a film you can watch again and again. If you haven't yet, give it a try; it could be the start of a beautiful friendship.",Casablanca
476,oconnor0930,Classic-blanca,8,10 March 2010,"This classic love story really delivers. I may even venture so far as to say it is the best romantic movie of all time. Humphrey Bogart's acting is once again phenomenal. He delivers his lines socoolly. He is very suave and is equally matched by Ingrid Bergman. They have so much on screen chemistry. The flashbacks to Paris add to the whole romance. The audience gets the treat to see their love come full circle. Their final moments together rip your heart to shreds. However, even if you are not into romance as a genre, there is still something to be gained in ""Casablanca"".Curtiz's direction is understated and subtle, but that is one of the movie's strong suits. He doesn't let his personal style and need to creatively express himself overpower the plot and take away from the movie. Curtiz's direction adds to the movie and compliments it beautifully. Furthermore, the screenplay is the second cherry on top when it comes to the production.The scene where the national anthems are dueling each other is powerful. The story is strong because it is about the war but also not about the war at the same time. ""Casablanca"" instead focuses on people indirectly involved in the war and how this moment in history shapes them.""Casablanca"" is all-in-all a very well crafted movie. A must see.",Casablanca
477,c-feldman,Casablanca,8,9 December 2010,"Casablanca is a film made in 1942, the film was directed by Michael Curtiz. The film has many themes and issues that are easy for viewers to relate to. Morality and self-sacrifice are two of the most common themes in Casablanca. The main character Rick Blaine is torn between doing what he knows is right and staying true to his love. Rick Blaine is not the only character willing to give up everything for there love. Victor Laszlo and Ilsa Lund are intertwined with the character Rick. Ilsa is the object of both Victor and Rick's affection. In the beginning of the film Rick is a cynical character who has no interest in helping anyone. In one of the scene Rick says "" he doesn't stick his neck out for anyone."" Speaking about himself in regards to giving Victor the transit letters in order for him to leave Casablanca. As the film progresses Rick has a change in heart, double-crossing people in order to assist Victor and Ilsa in their escape. Rick forgets about his love for Ilsa and resentment for Victor and gives them the transits in order for them to have safe refuge away from Casablanca.There were some scenes in Rick's café that the cinematography was excellent. The light and shadows were especially intricate on the side of Ilsa Lunds' face. Creating a soft tone against the left side of her face. Another scene that I found the lighting absolutely phenomenal was at the end of the film with Captain Louis and Rick. The dark shadows along the left outer edges and the lighter shadow on the right part of the frame creates a light dark frame in which the two men are seen. The light and dark shadows create almost of fog around the scene.",Casablanca
478,critical-escapist,"Play it Sam, play Casablanca",10,1 April 2006,"Casablanca is one of those films that have been mentioned so often that I have became extremely curious about it. I had extremely high expectations for this film  maybe because this film deserves such high expectations from younger audiences. Casablanca is about Rick (Humphrey Bogart), a nightclub owner who is a lonely man and has a life filled with one-night stands and glasses of wine. He does not want to be attached to anything personally or politically, but he has receive hold of two transit letters. Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), who is a Czech nationalist writer and his wife, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) has come to Rick's in search of exit visas because on their way to America, they must arrive at Casablanca first, and visas are hard to come by. Surprisingly, Rick and Ilsa were former lovers who met in Paris, and Ilsa was also the only woman Rick has ever loved. Their relationship ended when Rick flees the city from German armies and the plan was that they leave together. When Ilsa did not come to the train station, Rick left without Ilsa and hasn't seen her since. Rick is both angry and frustrated when he sees Ilsa, but he finds out that he still really loves her and might be also willing to help her and her husband.One of the great things about Casablanca is that it has a great story, rich in detail and is nicely done. This is why it is often cited as one of the Best Films Ever Made. Not only that is flourishes with romance but, it transforms into a worthy epic that moves quickly along the plot. As we watch the film, we find that Rick and Ilsa still love each other very much and are perfect for each other, but the two searches for the right thing to do, which is probably the hardest thing for both of them to do. They must leave each other because that is what is best for them.The problem in this film is that everything happens quickly. (Yes, I complain about Lost in Translation being too slow but now I'm complaining that Casablanca is too quick  how the heck can people please me?) This is one of the films that I wished that just went a little longer and maybe  just maybe  I would be pleased. I also wished the plot delve deeper into the characters because apparently, the flashback scene of Rick and Ilsa wasn't enough for me. I wished the story explored the characters a bit more, but of course, I think Ingrid Bergman's drop of tear coming from the edge of her eyes is quite enough for the film.The performances are really good. I don't think any modern movie stars can really compete with Bogart and Bergman. They are fantastic together. There is also Henreid, who has terrific scenes in the film. Conrad Veidt, who plays Strasser whose only goal is to capture Laszlo and is far more than the typical Nazi villain. Claude Rains plays Louis, who has always secured his and Rick's friendship (""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""). There is of course, Dooley Wilson, who played Sam and I think one of my favorite songs of all time has to be ""As Time Goes By."" I really enjoyed this film. I don't love it as much as I thought I would, but I really enjoyed it. Casablanca is often compared to Gone with the Wind and unfortunately, I think I still like Gone with the Wind a lot better. Casablanca is gorgeous for a black-and-white film. (But face it, all black-and-white films are gorgeous.) The ending closes with some promise of a world of less regrets, but more memories. It is nice to know that Rick and Ilsa will always have Paris and Casablanca.",Casablanca

Of course, I did save the most famous one for last: ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.""Welcome to ""Casablanca"", regarded as one of the most popular movies of all time. I know, I know, everybody says that, but it's true. When people criticize movies today, Casablanca is usually one of the ""go-to"" films they turn to when they say ""They don't make 'em like they used to.""And, they would be correct.Ask any woman to name her top-five most romantic movies, and ""Casablanca"" will likely show up on her list. And when it comes to movie romances, men's eyes usually glaze over at the mere mention of them. Well, I am here to tell you there is plenty to keep a man's attention in this film and, in the end, he may actually walk away in a non-catatonic state.First, you have Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine, owner and proprietor of Rick's Café Americain in the city of Casablanca. An expatriated American, Rick is a cynic whose establishment is just this side of illegal, yet he manages to stay in business and make a good living at it. And besides, it's Bogey!Then there's Claude Rains as the local chief of police, Louis Renault. Captain Renault is slippery as an eel, especially when it comes to dealing with those in authority above him. He's also inquisitive, intelligent, and hypocritical.Up next are the Nazis. Morocco was French territory in 1941, and the Germans occupied France during that time. Here, they are presented as ambitious warmongers bent on world domination (and that would be correct). With the Nazis around, there is an inbred conflict from the get-go, as Casablanca is portrayed as a hub for the French Resistance during World War II. I should also point out that this is the earliest American film I know of that not only uses the term ""concentration camp"" by name, but it also suggests that people have died within them.Throw in a murder or two, and you have the makings of a good film-noir. Okay, so ""film-noir"" officially sprang up after World War II, but it still feels like one. The camera angles, shot composition, lighting, use of shadow, a brooding leading man (Bogart), and a tormented femme fatale (Ingrid Bergman) all add up toward the formula.All of this is capped off with sardonic wit and tight drama, signs of a well-written script (which, interestingly enough, was cobbled together right up to the very end of filming). Also, the timing of this movie is what made it such a hit. It ranks right up there with ""On the Waterfront"" (1954), ""The China Syndrome"" (1979), ""Guess Who's Coming to Dinner"" (1967), ""In the Heat of the Night"" (1967), and ""The Deer Hunter"" (1978) in terms of topicality within the society of the day.So, you men out there, when your woman suggests watching ""Casablanca"", throw some popcorn in the microwave. Trust me, you'll be able to sit through this one!",Casablanca

Yes, I know it's a classic, but I was really liked the plot a lot and the story line. I liked how it was places during World War 2. I thought that the directing and camera work was great. The picture was clear and the camera movement was steady. Also the acting was amazing, I especially enjoyed the most of the characters, I did like Humphrey which I guess a lot of people didn't.

484,Goodbye_Ruby_Tuesday,You Must Remember This,10,1 June 2008,"It's almost unfair to lavish praise on CASABLANCA, for such universal praise comes the expectation of the masterwork of an auteur such as Welles or Hitchcock. The result could not be farther from that expectation, and indeed it is difficult to describe just how and why CASABLANCA remains such a beloved film. Here is a film that nobody wanted to make (especially the stars, who only bonded when trying to get out of the film), that was saddled with production problems from day one due to the incomplete script, and somehow has turned into the most brilliant accidental masterpiece in American cinema.Humphrey Bogart stars as a cross between a Hemingway anti-hero and Jesus in a waiter's outfit. Richard Blaine, American, age 37 with questionably brown eyes and a sketchy past, runs a popular nightclub in Casablanca during the early days of WWII that attracts a rainbow of diverse characters from Italian thieves to bickering Frenchmen, from desperate refugees to German officers. Rick has all the right things to say (courtesy of the brilliant dialogue via the Epstein Twins, Howard Koch and Casey Robinson) but is deeply flawed, a cynical, selfish man with clearly no respect for himself or other people save the French officer Louis Renault and best friend, the piano-playing Sam. Just as the audience is wondering what made Rick such a complex character, the answer comes in the form of the beautiful Ilsa Lund (the ethereal Ingrid Bergman), who of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, walks into Rick's and turns his life upside down. As the woman he once loved and got away for unexplained reasons, it becomes clear that Rick still bears the scars of her leaving him--and that Ilsa still loves him. Now married to Czech resistance fighter Viktor Lazlo (Paul Henried), the couple try in vain to acquire exit visas and, believing that Rick has two letters of transit that would allow anyone to leave Casablanca without question, Ilsa and Viktor try to crack his outer crust, and Rick must choose between his love for Ilsa and his idealistic interior he only thinks he can hide.When one looks objectively at CASABLANCA, there isn't a lot to rave about, and yet everything comes together so seamlessly. Michael Curtiz's fine knowledge of how the camera told a story was put to excellent use here, from the sweeping shots that pass through imaginary walls to the delicacy of Ingrid Bergman's face. The script, written by at least four different screenwriters while shooting was taking place, should've collapsed under the weight of its own multiple genres and chaotic preparation, but the actors say their lines with a conviction and believability it's difficult to realize that nobody wanted to be there in the first place. Above all things, it's the characters and performances that make CASABLANCA what it is today. As Roger Ebert pointed out, all the characters are so good, and even the ones that are meant to be ambiguous (such as Renault) or crooks (such as Ugarte), they are so interesting and lively the audience feels compelled to follow them out of Rick's and see where fate takes them. At the center of all this is Rick and Ilsa's tortured love affair. Unlike almost all other love stories, the audience never knows how Rick and Ilsa first met. Unlike almost all other love stories, it doesn't matter; the audience doesn't need a meet-cute scene within the Paris flashback--we see it all in the way Bogart and Bergman look at each other with such love and understanding, and we feel their pain of witnessing their awkward encounter almost two years after Ilsa ran away from Rick. It is a testament to the actors yet again that makes a rather conventional love story so interesting and involving. The role of an anti-hero is one Humphrey Bogart could've sleepwalked through, but under Michael Curtiz's direction there's an understanding just beneath the surface that breaks through. And Ingrid Bergman more or less disowned the film that cemented her in film history (and objectively speaking Ilsa is a very underwritten character), but she was above all things a professional; she did her job and she did it so well she was never able to escape the praise that followed her to her death. Her most celebrated scene is perhaps when Curtiz lets the camera linger on her gorgeous face while Sam plays ""it,"" and memories of love and pain come rushing back. Any other actress would've overplayed it, but Bergman is almost doing what another famous Swedish import had done 9 years earlier, when Greta Garbo made a blank face and let the audience interpret the final close-up of QUEEN Christina, even though the audience *does* know what Ilsa's thinking, and it's all the more poignant for Bergman's performance.How CASABLANCA has survived for over 60 years is a miracle, and it'll continue to inspire for another 60 years, because it's still the same old story: a fight for love and glory, a case of do or die. All great literature and films are still relevant because of their universal themes; in this case, the world will always welcome a great love story, terrific acting and classic storytelling as time goes by.",Casablanca
485,Doug-135,Unforgettable.,10,8 March 2001,"Thank goodness this movie isn't associated with a specific holiday or it would be as over-played as ""It's a Wonderful Life."" Members of the cast and crew have said that working on this picture was just like any other - no one had any idea that it would go on to become such a classic. Even while shooting it, changes were being made - the famous ending where Claude Rains and Humphrey Bogart walk off into the fog was not in the original script. (TV's The Simpsons even featured an alternative ending in one of their shows!) The plot involves wartime refugees gathering in Morocco hoping to obtain scarce exit visas to Lisbon. All of the elements - production, story, music, script and direction are woven together to create a motion picture masterpiece.

486,uscoa,"One of the Greats, though time goes by.",10,24 October 2000,"What to say of Casablanca? It's one of the most beloved films of all time, its romance and immortal lines have brought it into history. It's really an ordinary film, even Ingrid Bergman has so commented. The cinematography is nothing to gawk at, nor does the film possess any godsends of technical achievement, nor was it expected of run-of-the-mill director Michael Curtiz. The play it was based on, Everybody Comes to Rick's, was second-rate even in 1942. But the acting is something special. At the time, Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, and Paul Henreid were hardly household names. Bogart, then just establishing himself as a serious actor, nearly lost the lead role to actor George Raft. Raft refused to have a nobody like Ingrid Bergman be his costar. While Bogart lost that year's Oscar to Paul Lukas, this is his most famous if not best performance. Bergman was passed over come Oscar night, but she too gives a great performance, bursting with the tangible emotion necessary for her part. However, I must first tip my cap to Claude Rains, who plays Captain Louis Renault. He is one of great character actors, and never have I seen him more in character.But the true star of Casablanca is the Oscar-winning screenplay, the brainchild of playwrights Julius and Philip Epstein. The screenplay has brought its lines to the lips and minds of even those unfortunate enough to have never seen the film. Lines like `Here's looking at you kid' and `Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship'.Lastly, there's that song, As Time Goes By. It's never completely played, in fact its almost just squeezed into the film. It's an ordinary song, but it's the song of Rick and Ilsa (Bogart and Bergman) and that makes it incredible; so much that my heart fills with remembrance of this beautiful film whenever I see it.If you haven't seen it; see it. 10/10 Stars",Casablanca

Even those who have not seen this film yet still know and have heard about it.Casablanca is a film about love and war. This film was created just before world war II. During it there are some between the lines showing that Germany will lose the war, before they even knew who would win and lose. Which I personally believe to be as something very magnificent and special.The acting in Casablanca was one to be unforgettable. Humphrey Bogart plays Richard 'Rick' Blaine and actress Ingrid Bergman plays Lisa Lund. Together they play wonderful roles.The cinematography is something amazing. some of the best for its time.

489,bruscinoa833,Casablanca,8,12 May 2010,"This film has elements of any great film, romance, action and suspense. The cast is just wonderful and they fit so well together. Humphrey Bogart plays Rick so well changing from the reserved night club owner into a man in love and willing to risk everything. Peter Lorre who is a fabulous character actor plays Ugarte so well, his character is endearing in a way but a the same time you are always worried what his next move will be in fear that it will endanger the characters. The slow build up of the suspense between the German soldiers and the patrons of the night club makes this movie one that you can't take your eyes off of. From the beginning scene in which Ugarte tells Rick that he has the transit papers I was on the edge of my seat. The scene in which Rick allows the French to sing their national anthem while the German soldiers are singing theirs is one of absolute triumph. The lighting throughout the film mimicked the feelings of the characters. During the scene in which there is tenderness between Rick and Illsa the lighting is soft and seems to frame their faces but in the scenes with suspense the lighting is much darker. It is no wonder that this film has gone down in history it is remarkable.",Casablanca

Thats about all I understood until ricks little flashback scene to Paris. I enjoyed Rick's character and the character of the piano player but other than that I was not impressed. One thing this movie made clear is that they use to drink and smoke a lot. Just about every scene there doing both, constantly. The relationship between Rick and Ilsa Lund does get a little more interesting when you find out there history but in the end Rick doesn't end up with here so who care's? yeah he did the right thing because he knew she'd have a better life with Victor Laszlo but that just ruined the movie for me.

A women thinks that her husband is dead, and she ends up falling in love with another man, but then goes back to her husband after she discovers he's alive. Then she wanted to go to America with Rick, but Rick makes her stay with her husband. For the story of the movie I believe this works. I don't believe, however, it's realistic in real life. Besides the verisimilitude of the movie, there were other aspects that were great. The acting, especially on Humphrey Bogart's part, was spectacular. The lighting and the scenery was done very well. The writing and directing is what impressed me the most. Towards the end, I anticipated on what would happen, and it turns out I was totally wrong. Rick doesn't go to America, Rick shoots the German officer, the chief of police doesn't arrest Rick. This certainly surprised me in a good way. what I liked most was the theme in the end. How France and America were not going to sit back anymore and watch Germany take over. They were going to fight for their independence again.",Casablanca
492,n-racicot,Casablanca,7,15 December 2010,The film Casablanca was directed by Micharl Curtiz in 1942. This American romance drama tells the story of how fate tried to bring two people together. The main character(played by Humphrey Bogart) is faced with a major dilemma. HE can either run off with the girl whom he has feelings for or he can let her go and potentially help fight the good fight. The movie was released around the time of world war 2 so there is a strong military presence during the whole thing. The dialogue and screenplay are remarkable adding to the power of the story. An example of that is Ingrid Bergman. Her performance dealing with her characters emotions were right on spot. Overall The characters made the movie a classic.,Casablanca

The quality I liked most about this film was its ability to suck me in, although I must admit there where parts where I got lost a little bit.There's a lot going on this movie, World War 2, the running of his club, double crossing, and of course you cant forget the ultimate love story. for being a movie thats older, well not from my generation,i didn't find the dialog to be overly cheesy.The ending of this movie is pretty awesome.I like that you think you know whats going to happen but you don't, (at the airport situation, who gets blame etc).There's also some great cinematography in Casablanca. The use of lighting to set up shots for the camera is magnificent. They also tend to focus on a searchlight in the movie as well.The actors in Casablanca are just magnificent, they really add a certain well, realistic element, for lack of a better term. Humphrey Bogart is enjoyable as usual. I've only seen a few of his films, but this is my favorite by far. He does such a good job of keeping his character in line, invulnerable and cold at times, but heartfelt at others. now i can really understand the line ""of all the jin joints in all the world.""",Casablanca
494,crivers123,Casablanca (1942),9,12 April 2011,"The lighting and photography in Casablanca (1942) was phenomenal.In the beginning when we are shown the streets of Casablanca, the shot contains so much activity and movement it appeals visually to the viewer almost immediately. The same can be said when we first are shown Rick's club, the amount of contrast and so many things moving at once (and bright) in one shot. There is a scene when the police chief is talking to Rick while Rick is out of the shot. Rick's shadow is seen clearly against the wall and it appears as if the chief is talking directly to Rick's shadow. A good visual effect. In the scene when Rick is drinking and sulking in the middle of the night, the lighting (or lack of) and shadows totally set the depressing mood for that scene. The protagonists are mostly seen wearing brighter/lighter colored clothing. I like that the social message of the film was one of anti-Nazisentiment, especially because at the time of the film's release the war had not been won yet. The dialog was witty and fast paced. Very good film.",Casablanca

Warner Bros attempted to remake it with ""Passage to Marseilles"" (even used many of same cast), but by then the USA was 3+ years into WW2, and reality had brought to homes the true horror of the War to too many families.",Casablanca
496,NOXiFy,Great movie with an excellent story line,8,8 April 2012,"This movie was a great see; I'd definitely recommend it to family and friends after watching it because it tells an interesting story (which is hard to find if you're looking for a drama). The photography was excellent and uses many different types of shots to really expose the film as much as possible and give you good views on conversations and the actions by following the 180 - rule. The sound was in sync and sounded great and not muffled or distant like some movies seem. I'd just like to note that I saw the original black & white film and it had a great picture.Overall I rated it an 8 out of 10 because it was was a great movie however it just doesn't tell as good of a story as many other drama's that I have seen including ""Seven Pounds"" and ""Forrest Gump"".",Casablanca
497,Emillion,"""I stick my head out for nobody.""",9,13 November 2014,"Michael Curtiz's masterpiece, Casablanca, is easily one of my favorite movies of all time. The plot brilliantly demonstrates self sacrifice and ever- lasting love in a way that is untraditional and completely original. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman have amazing chemistry that really brings the story to life. The lighting is perfect and natural, despite being filmed in a studio, the dialog has a good rhythm, and the composition was spot on. The image appeared to be very crisp and clear with no imperfections. The sets and prop designs were beautiful with a truly authentic Moroccan style. The flashbacks were very well shot and utilized effectively, there were a few comparison shots that were well thought out. Overall Casablanca is a movie far beyond its time that will be forever loved and respected.",Casablanca
498,stillnessbreaker,Pretty Good Film,8,17 October 2012,"Casablanca was interesting to say the least, it was a little slow for me, which may have been the reason why I lost interest. However, when the story picked up it caught my interest a bit. It's kinda a hard thing to grasp unless you are paying attention. I thought Humphrey Bogart did a great job as did Ingrid Bergman portraying their characters. I heard this film was very funny, I didn't find it to be very funny, however their are a few times I found it slightly humorous. The relationships between the characters was strong. I thought Rick was one of the best characters, he was so complex and always showing another part of himself. Awesome surprise at the ending, the ending in my opinion was the greatest way to end this film.",Casablanca
499,BatmanAndRobyn,Obvious Instant Classic!,10,13 March 2013,"Prior to seeing this in it's entirety, I'd only seen the closing scene where the plane is taking off and Bogart's infamous quote is spoken.Needless to say, this film was fantastic. The characters and acting were flawless. The story line includes a love story of epic proportions and shows the audience what war and invasions can do to a relationship. It tears it apart. Also, for some reason, I really liked Sam's storyline-- I found him to be a very interesting minor character.The use of one sided, low-lighting was present throughout and helped make some of the scenes seem a bit more dramatic. I also found myself admiring the photography from beginning to end. You could pause that movie at almost any spot and it could easily be used as a still frame or photograph. Still frames alone would be able to tell this story, obviously not as great as the film though. The cinematography and photography were absolutely beautiful.",Casablanca
500,kidboi,"Touching, very touching",10,23 August 2006,"'Casablanca' is a film every person in the world should see. Even if they're not going to like. This film is simply a must see, to say the very least. But what is it that makes 'Casablanca' a classic? One of things would be the acting, which mostly stands out by Humphrey Bogart. He plays Rick Blaine, a man who lives between two constantly opposing sides - Germans and the french. He watches them tare each other apart and he is like the battlefield. Always stomped over.Other things that make this film superb are the beautiful music, excellent story line and great portrayal of Casablanca in WWII.Yet, there are quite a few things that turn me off in this movie. Only one, actually. And that would be the cinematography. It's kind of stiff, uninteresting, lacks a touch of originality, but that is just a minor glitch. Other things of this masterpiece overwhelm it.To repeat myself again, this movie is a must see. If you can't get it on DVD, you can still catch it on TCM, together with other classic movies.10/10",Casablanca
501,tabbyharwood,Lost love in the middle of World War II,7,21 October 2014,"Casablanca is a movie full of suspense within a period of time when individuals were fleeing for their freedom. The setting of the movie being in Africa in the middle of World War II provided the sense of the characters within the film to represent what was actually happening in real life.Individuals flock to this lounge, owned by Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) to find freedom from the Nazis. The Nazis invade the lounge to find criminals or those that are looking to free themselves.A lounge full of corruption turns into a draping love story from past love. You see from within the film how the reappearance of the Ilsa Lund changes Rick Blaine from his calm character into a character overpowered by love.The use of lighting throughout the film gives you the sense of feeling what the characters are feeling. From the sense of hiding from the Nazis and the dim lighting of music being played to portray a sense of love being felt.The use of the camera using slow moving motions to create a suspense and uncertainty kept my interest throughout the film. The use of characters and their roles within the film was used brilliantly and help set the tone for each scene within the film",Casablanca
502,Patti-Gaston,Timeless classic,10,5 March 2015,"Truly one of the most remarkable films ever made; from the witty dialogue to the stunning photography to the beautiful acting, I cannot praise this movie too much. Almost immediately you enter into a visual spectacle from the beautiful reflections on the walls of the Cafe Americain to beautiful women dressed in sparkly costumes to Rick in his perfectly pressed, white dinner jacket we enter a world of sophistication and beauty. We quickly learn however that there are real troubles just beneath the surface. Immediately we learn that 2 German couriers have been murdered. The police suspect the murderer is at Rick's café but before the police arrest the suspect he asks Rick to hold the transport papers he stole from the Germans which are the keys to freedom from the German controlled, but unoccupied French Moroccan city of Casablanca. Rick is suave, sophisticated and clever until Ilsa walks in,the woman who broke his heart. We learn that the two had a love affair in Paris and as they were about to leave Paris together right before the German occupation Ilsa did not meet Rick at the train station when she was supposed to. She sent a note along with Sam that said she was not coming. Needless to say Rick was bitter when she shows up in his Cafe but over time he does find out why Ilsa left him. He is also inspired on how to use the transport papers. While the overall focus of the movie is the love story between Rick and Ilsa and the sacrifices made for love, the Nazi threat is made all to real. The release of the movie 6 months after the United States' involvement in WWII, shined a light on how terrifying it must have been for people trying to escape. I think everyone should watch this movie again and again to remind us all that even in the absolutely worst of times love can conquer anything.",Casablanca
503,lhug74,Casablanca,6,8 March 2015,"I didn't like this movie as much as I thought I would. I was a little bit confused at times about who was who, what they wanted, where they were from, and where they wanted to go. Casablanca is about a man from America named Rick who owns a very popular nightclub in Casablanca, a town full of people from all over the place trying to get to America but it's not that easy because World War II was going on. The beginning of the movie involves the police rounding up suspects who might have possession of letters of transit because they were stolen after the murder of two German officials. The letters of transit allowed whoever had them to travel freely which would make it easy for whoever had them to get to America. Rick met a girl, Ilsa, while he was in Paris before he came to Casablanca who he really loved and she planned to run away with him but when Rick went to leave she was nowhere to be found. One night Ilsa and her husband showed up at Rick's café. He was shocked, he thought he would never see her again. Rick was tipped of that she was there when the piano player at his café started to play a song that he told him never to play but Ilsa requested it. Ilsa needs the letters to get to America but Rick didn't give them to her at first. She then held a gun to him and demanded he give her the letters and when she didn't shoot him she admitted that she still loved him and that when they meet in Paris she thought her husband died at a concentration camp. However, she found out he was actually alive and that was why she didn't go with Rick that morning and didn't give him any explanation. At the end, it seemed like Ilsa was going to stay with Rick but when they got to the airport Rick made her get on the plane with her husband even though she wanted to stay with him. He told her she would regret it if she didn't get on the plane so she eventually did but not before an officer got in the way and tried to stop them from boarding the plane. Rick shot him and Ilsa and her husband got on the plane. When the other police arrive, the officer who witnessed the shooting told them to round up the usual suspects in order to protect Rick from getting in trouble for shooting him. The end shows Rick walking away with the man who didn't turn him in and Rick saying the famous line of ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" I didn't hate this movie but it definitely wasn't one of my favorites. The acting was great but I thought it was kind of boring and it didn't really change setting too much, the whole movie pretty much took place in Rick's café.",Casablanca
504,codymontanye,Very enjoyable,7,10 March 2015,"Being that it is a renowned classic I had a lot of expectations when going in to watch Casablanca. But if I'm being completely honest I believe that it was a bit over sold, not to say that I didn't enjoy the movie; I really did enjoy it. I found the plot of the movie to be very engaging and not too hard to follow and the acting was absolutely amazing. I thought there was so much to take in, which I really enjoyed and there many round characters that had great character development. I really enjoyed the character of Rick and how he progressed throughout the movie. I also very much so loved all of the quick witted humor that filled the movie and you either got it or you didn't, it wasn't highlighted at all. And besides the writing and the performances of the cast I really loved the lighting used throughout the movie and thought that it helped to amplify the story significantly. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie and will most likely watch it again because I believe that there is a lot more that I could take from the movie, if I were to go back and re- watch it.",Casablanca

The story is so rich with social meaning and significance. It portrays the absolute terror that was occurring during WWII without being grotesque or violent. It shows how desperate people were to keep their heads above water, and out of Nazi control. The acting is phenomenal. Humphrey Bogart is effortlessly cool, and translates the idea of the isolationist mentality of Americans at the time before the war. Ingrid Bergman is so pure and honest, her character comes across through the incredible emotion she is able to express on screen. All of this aside, the thing that absolutely sets this movie apart from others like it is the writing. The script is amazing. It might be the best script ever. Every line is carefully thought out. No line is a waste everything anyone says has meaning. Please go watch this movie. It will change how you look at film in America.",Casablanca
506,cleigh115,One of the best!,10,11 May 2015,"Time seems to date some movies badly, while it has worked greatly in favor of some movies, like Casablanca. It was made in the day when color was rare, yet, used black and white so well that it seems to be a great example of a movie that should have been filmed in black and white, even if doing such were to have cost more than color. Casablanca is a real classic. It's the sort of movie that feels like an experience and makes you glad you've seen it. It was all so excellent that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who loves movies. When you see some of these scenes for yourself you immediately understand how they've had such a lasting influence to this day. For the leading characters, their relationship meant hope, which was exactly what was needed throughout the bleak time that was World War II. Every character leaves an indelible mark even though all it did in the movie was hit a few guitar strings or pick pocket at a restaurant. Every scene in the movie is a study in itself.

It's just one of those things you hear a lot about throughout your life, but don't really get where people are coming from until you see it for yourself. Casablanca has something for everyone: action, drama, romance, etc. The movie itself is timeless. Rick is a strong, confident character and handles certain situations rather effortlessly. It's interesting to watch how everyone gravitates towards the character with a strong sense of independence. The characters are what really make the film. There is a perfect balance between humor and seriousness, and a mix between the good, the bad, and the morally gray. Many may find this film overrated, but regardless of one's opinion this film is a must watch.",Casablanca

On my second time watching the film, I picked up many subtly elements that truly improved the overall feel of the film that I did not see when I watched the film many years ago. The dialog that the characters use is also very realistic to the time period so is not necessarily easily understood by viewers from this century. The characters also speak very fast and can be quite often hard to understand. Despite these few caveats, Casablanca ultimately does not disappoint. The film features many different special effects that were previously not seen in this way in the film industry and also has an exciting plot which draws the viewer into the film, as long as they can keep up with the ""lingo"".",Casablanca
509,guedesnino,"Casablanca is a utopian world, a great metaphor about life that is at once the limbo linking hell to paradise.",9,17 June 2017,"In ""Adaptation"" by Spike Jonze, ""Casablanca"" is referred to as a masterpiece for those who want to study and create a screenplay, the consideration is made by screenwriter Robert McKee (Brian Cox), and without a doubt: it is.The 1942 classic directed by Michael Curtiz, goes through the centuries as the reference of the seventh art, mainly for the development of its history, an exquisite script that follows the classic linear structure (beginning, middle and end), and who knows how to take advantage of it To provoke small breaks in linearity, in developing a dramatic history whose past we do not know but which is a fundamental part that interferes with the decisions and characteristics of a character, and an uncertain future, but with clear possibilities. We know the paths available to the protagonists, but which will be the chosen and the reason, this only know at the end of the film. The script is based on the play ""Everybody Comes To Rick's,"" being developed in three hands, by Julius J. Epstein, Philip G. Epstein and Howard Koc. A curiosity is that the text of the piece only got to be mounted (years) later, and the rights to the cinema was one of the highest values ​​paid at the time.""Casablanca"" begins with an ironic narration, close to the comedies that parody wars, and at different moments we have this jocular air in the dialogues of the personages, such as Richard Blane (Humphrey Bogart ) That satirizes its condition of abandoned man or of the transitory condition and of waiting of the great room of connections that is the ""airport Casablanca"". However, the script makes the slide precisely by wanting to present the external world through flash black, a feature that does not add anything interesting to the film, but is an easy way out to try to clarify important facts of the past, yet something that a script So bright and a precise direction, could have solved with other means.A thriving feature used to compose the illumination of the film is the idea of ​​a lantern of a lighthouse, which reflects its turn throughout that city, although spatially speaking, the light of this lighthouse reveals that Casablanca is as short as the extension between two open arms , But it is clear the proposal of director Michael Curtiz that with the direction of photography of Arthur Edeson, create an atmosphere of occultism, and that as the characters, we only have vestiges of shadows, they are not clear, as the lapses of illumination , Which little by little reveals something. Another point that contributes to the illumination and photography adopted is the total superficiality employed. We are in a city in Morocco, where sunlight is strong and abundant, but as ""Casablanca"" was shot in the studio, and also proposes the features of a Superficial city, its illumination is composed of lamps, chandeliers, lamps, glares and lighthouses and rarely we have reflections of the sun. This artificiality is also felt in the direction of art performed by Carl Jules Weyl, who in what would be internal and external scenarios, works with very definite oppositions, in the internal environments we have the richness of details, as in the bar ""Ricks Café American"" or "" Club Owner Signor Ferrari ""in these environments everything is very luxurious and grandiose and well explored in open plans or the close detail minutiae revealing a beautiful work of composition of images and Mise en scène.The soundtrack is marked by the classic ""Like the Time Goes By"" and La Marseillaise, the national anthem of France. Both gain ""status"" in addition to soundtrack, become ""leitmotiv"", and generating some uneasiness, in the third strand of La Marseillaise more than to know that the French are there or that it is a quest to praise France, we know that It is an insecurity on the part of the director to clarify points that are already established as local skin frequented or by the uniforms used by the characters (eg differentiate German soldiers from the French). But the apex of exaltation of the national anthem of France occurs when it is used to provoke the Germans, capable even of uniting the French who are in the Rick café and under German rule.Humphrey Bogart as Richard Blane, Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund Laszlo and Paul Henreid as Victor Laszlo, stand out individually, and the alien origin of each actor favors the clandestine and migratory game inherent in the film. If separately each actor stands out, the combination in a love triangle works even more, and greatly divides the viewer to the lovable favoritism of Ilsa's character, for both the charming Blane and the heroic Victor are charismatic and with divergent qualities, but Together only complicate yet another position that helps in determining who Ilsa should stay with.

Even the flash back sequences which I remember on first viewing I thought of as naff and on the twee side I now realise fit perfectly into the notion of carefree love between the main protagonists and subsequently explain their feelings in later encounters.Elements such as the costumes for both men and women are outstanding and all photograph beautifully in B&W ,especially that little number Ilsa is wearing during her chat with Nick in the market place.All the actors , even the most minor of minor characters have been superb and after countless viewings I still get the afterglow of Nick's natural goodness when he saves the young Bulgarian lass from the clutches of the police chief by letting her win at roulette and so enabling her to pay for her exit visa. Although this film is set in a specific time and place it has not really dated.There will always be times when the whole world goes mad and danger is at hand.People need help.People need love.

The characters are rich, and while not all of them are complex they are still a treat and do not feel trope-y.

Yes, this movie is one of the best love stories ever filmed, along with some of the best actors doing their best acting, beautiful lighting, camera techniques and loaded with heavy moments and metaphor. I would have to say that every aspect of this movie reached my expectations. But the most enjoyable part for me was getting to observe all of the famous phrases, which I have heard many times throughout my life but not known their origin, in their correct context. On numerous occasions I have seen my grandfather raise his glass, after saying grace before dinner, and say, ""Here's to looking at you kid"" and then chuckle to himself. I never new what he was quoting (I never usually do) so it was so great to discover (after twenty years of hearing it) that it was Humphrey Bogart my papa was in fact quoting.

Maybe I just don't understand different countries and different governments so I can't follow what goes on when I watch it in movies.

In the city of Casablanca there are stone sidewalks, and dim lights. Ricks Café and the Blue Parrot are just two of the many ""cool"" places to be in Casablanca. The characters also fit in well with the story. Although I did not care much for Ilsa. This is because it always seemed as though she wanted to ""have her cake and eat it too."" She was married to a caring and loyal man, and she decides to cheat on him with the mysterious Rick. For this reason I very much so enjoy the ending when Rick forces Ilsa to go on the plane with her husband. We expected the opposite out of such a suave love story.

Beautifully shot, the film delivers strong meaning visually, utilizing such shots as when the camera tilts down from the slogan of the French revolution as the usual suspects are rounded up, or when Captain Renault discards the Vichy French water bottle. The characters are nicely and methodically developed over the course of the movie, and the acting reinforces this.

The movie took place during the Occupation of Europe and during that time there was a lot music. Music is what kept people going.The music helped the emotions show through the characters. It was a story that many people could relate to if they were ever in a relationship.Overall I would recommend this because all the camera angles, transitions, sound, color, plot and characters made the movie interesting.

The movie has a really meaningful story, and a super exciting, fast-paced plot. The love story you see take place in the film is already half over when the film starts. I thought that we were going to be able to see the two characters meet and fall in love, however they had already met and are already in love from the beginning of the film. Having the characters already share history and having their history revealed to us over time is a really gripping and impacting way to tell a story.

522,alexv1208,Review of Casablanca,9,14 November 2010,"Casablanca is a persuasive pro-American film. It's fictional yet accurately portrays events that took place during world War II. The film has a large political influence, even Rick's character represents America's isolation from the war. The film is beautifully written and shot. Music plays a huge part in the film. It emphasizes the setting and feel of the film. As the mood of the characters change, so does the music. Even when the French sing their national anthem this adds so much to the film, and it becomes even more clear how passionate the French are about their country. The accents of the actors add to the mise-en scene, as well as the lighting in many of the scenes, such as the lighting in the restaurant, when everything is dim, the candles on the table are the only form of light, creating a certain mood. The movie is very fast paced, you can't look away for a moment or get out of your chair for a snack. There's always some new twist. Casablanca is a thrilling film to watch, and one that really lives up to it's expectations.",Casablanca
523,ben_jm89,Review for History of Cinema,9,5 March 2011,"""Casablanca"" was a total surprise to me. I have heard that it was a great film, even one of the best. I now agree, it is fantastic. The cinematography and lighting are what make this such an amazing and intriguing movie. It was beautiful to watch. quite an artful presentation allows the audience to really get a feel for the characters struggles and triumphs. the art form adds an aspect to the film that modern movies just don't have. i don't believe another will ever hold such an high quality feel as ""Casablanca"" has. Of course the story, plot, and characters are also very well done, but in my opinion it is the presentation of everything that really grabs your attention. i'm sure this film was substantially more powerful at the time it was released during the war, but today one can still feel the struggles of the time period in this movie. i really enjoyed all the humor that is tucked in to such a serious subject it takes the edge off.",Casablanca
524,E-reilly3,Great classic movie,9,10 May 2011,The cinematography in this movie is unparalleled. The dark lighting and heavy shadows create that classic film noir feeling that gives this movie the dramatic effect. One thing that I really liked is that there are a lot of close up and medium close ups that really focus the viewers attention on who is speaking and allow us to concentrate on the story. A very creative aspect to the movie is how we don't find out the story between Rick and Ilsa all at once. Flashbacks and the use of the character Sam allow us to slowly figure out the situation between the two. The dramatic twist at the end comes as an unexpected but valiant move and shows Rick to be the character that we didn't quite see him as throughout the rest of the movie.,Casablanca
525,danburyn,Great film!,7,7 March 2012,"The director of this really knew what he was doing from lighting to camera angle. Every shot seemed well planned out before they even started filming. In some movies you can tell when they just threw in another scene here and there but not in this movie. Also the lighting on the each characters face was right on the money and allowed the viewer to really connect with every character. the camera angles allowed you to really enjoy the back ground as much as the characters in them, giving you a whole new spectrum of feeling. The feelings of World War II is also well shown in Casablanca (1942). The they talk about the war and the actors really doing a good job channeling the feelings of war and really there characters. Over all I would highly recommend this movie to anyone!",Casablanca
526,NineFelines,Classic,9,10 March 2012,"Seeing this movie for the first time, it is easy to understand why it is a much loved classic. The mise-en-scène is superb as is the acting and lighting and camera work. Even though, as with virtually all movies, the drama factor is a bit heightened by the compression of time (story vs. movie), it flows very well. The quality of the acting makes the characters are very believable and enduring. The way Bogart was lit during his close-ups to show the lines of his face, really conveyed his emotional state and Bergman always appeared to be on the verge of tears (no doubt thanks to a special lens or camera effect).While I knew the movie had been released before the end of World War 2, it didn't occur to me that actually meant the movie was in a position to predict the outcome (or to at least postulate a much hoped for conclusion). A prediction that, thankfully, was correct.",Casablanca
527,foxhunter25,Casablanca (1942),7,19 October 2012,"Casablanca is about a club owner (Bogart) who has in his position to paper that will let anyone leave WWII Casablanca no questions asked. Bogart tries to keep everyone happy, which included the French police, Nazi officers, customers, and his one competitor. Through out the movie Bogart is is debating weather or not he should help the husband of his past lover, who happens to be a leader of a large underground movement against the Nazis. In the end he helps them escape just in time, before the Nazi officers arrive at the airport, and he and the police chief become friends once again. I give this film a 7 out of 10 because I didn't like the movie that much but i did find it enjoyable.",Casablanca
528,alwaysdubbin91,wow...,9,31 October 2012,"this is a timeless film. the plot has a very good balance between complexity and ease to fallow. there is a lot going on at any given time, but the director Michael Curtiz and the editor Owen Marks do a great job of keeping everything under control so the viewer does not get lost. the acting is absolutely superb on basically every account, especially Humphrey Bogart's. his character Rick own the most popular café/bar in town, but Rick has a lot of things to deal with and i thought that Bogart really gave the character exactly what it needed. this movie is also interesting because it had a lot of political ties with the things that were actually happening when the movie was released.",Casablanca
529,Taffyta,Pretty good!!,7,10 March 2013,"By the end of Casablanca, I was well aware of where certain famous quotes originated from. I was pretty surprised to keep hearing lines that I've heard before in other movies or TV shows. I was excited to see the famous airport scene. One thing that really confused me was the transition to the time Rick and Ilsa spent in Paris. I must have zoned out or was thinking of something else, because I could have SWORN that it was a flashback into it, but then it never seemed to get out of it. Like there was a flashback, but it continued on to the rest of the story. I'm not sure what happened there. The characters were interesting enough, though. The romantic aspect of it was enjoyable and the twists at the end. It wasn't really my kind of story, but I liked it regardless.",Casablanca
530,Dollardave86,Escape the Chaos in Europe,9,30 March 2014,"Regarded by some as one of the greatest movies ever written, Casablanca will sure not let you don't. The film really became a part of history, because it was shot around World War II. In the one bar in this movie, you saw people in neutral territory trying to escape the chaos in Europe. The performances were excellent from Rick (Humphrey Bogart) to the French and Germans. The film was shot in black and white but, the characters were so colorful. The scenes have very low lighting and there was a very smoky look. A spotlight shined so bright that you could see it pointed in front of Ricks bar and the inside as well. This was definitely a love story, one of the best that I ever seen.",Casablanca
531,t-seeberger4,Analysis for Casablanca (1942),10,25 March 2014,"This film really made a lot of people happy. I also enjoyed a lot of the film. When it comes to the characters, I liked it when I noticed a few parts of the film where it's in a flashback with Rick and Ilsa. I also liked the parts when Rick said, ""Here's looking at you, kid."" Also, the photography shots are really nice. There were lots of shots that could be useful for photography, like the side lighting, diffused lighting, and more. Sadly, there were a few parts that I didn't like about this film, including the part when the police say that the café was closed and the last part of the flashback. Overall, this film will be remembered as one of the best movies of all time!",Casablanca
532,gcappadona,Casablanca Review,7,10 October 2014,"This film had the classic love story and is probably on the list of top 5 films ever created. Personally this film did not really do much for me. The love story seemed kind of cheesy; although, I did really enjoy the main character and who he represented throughout the film. Humphrey Bogart, Richard, represented the Americans throughout the war, which represented isolationism. Richard shows isolation in the film by never drinking with anyone. My favorite line throughout the movie was ""I'll stick my neck out for nobody"" and then the General replied with ""Ah, a wise foreign policy."" I think that was totally great. Another great aspect of the movie was the lighting. I think it was great when the light reflected off the sides of their faces and off the tops and brims of their hats. Overall the movie wasn't that bad, but I was expecting something way more complex than it actually was.",Casablanca
533,shavonnacroley,Casablanca (1942),10,9 October 2014,"There's no better way to say but I really enjoyed this film. The way the lighting and the scenes were displayed was beautiful. It had this soft/ smooth look and feel to it. I found it interesting that the film had a double meaning. One: it's a love story and a man who only wants to do what's best for him but later has a change of heart, Two: Humphrey Bogart is America and America is basically keeping to themselves and doesn't want to ""stick its neck out for no one."" It was great to see how it all played out. The plot/ story was great in itself, but the setting and layout of the film was great. There was one point when I felt like I was a patron in the saloon. I also notice how in the scenes when Rich (Bogart) was wearing white while everyone else had black on or gray. I feel as if it signified his neutral feeling towards the things that occurred in the film while everyone else was in misery or in darkness because of the war.",Casablanca
534,leonrach95,"""Round up the unusual suspects""",7,18 October 2014,"Casablanca is a beautifully written movie. Anyone watching this can relate to the characters due to the fact that its about a man and a woman in love, and forfeit their love for a greater purpose. The cast, the plot, and the direction of this movie make it one of a kind and all around brilliant. Bogart and Bergman create a love that keeps you on your toes and makes you feel like you're experience what they're experiencing with them. The way they talk to each other and the expressions they give towards each other makes you feel like these characters truly are in love with each other. With the tight budget that they were placed under for this movie they did an excellent job with the production of it.",Casablanca
535,jferraro3,Casablanca,8,14 October 2014,"Humphrey Bogart plays an amazing character as Rick Blaine in this film. He is a mysterious business man who 's character you fall in love with. This movie had a great exotic feel to it. All the different countries of the world came together in Casablanca. The actors really portrayed each culture very well with they're accents and costumes. The rest of the costumes for the movie were well done also. I loved how Humphrey Bogart was always looking as classy as possible with his suits and bow-tie. The music was very cool in this film as well, especially the character Sam who played for Rick in the saloon. He was really talented. The middle eastern singers and musicians in the bar also helped to give the movie this exotic feeling that worked really well.",Casablanca
536,MC_Barton,"""Everybody Comes to Rick's""",8,11 March 2015,"Casablanca is one of the most famous film titles, even by those who have never watched the movie. The plot is intriguing, set off of the coast of a Nazi-controlled Europe. Humphrey Bogart really nails his role as an ""American,"" the man whom everybody looks up to for his capacity to seemingly solve problems (hint-hint). Where the movie really shined was in it's camera work, the shots, angles, and lighting were fantastic. My personal interest was fixated on the development of Rick himself, the transformation he undergoes is absolutely romantic in human nature. The final scene is what really did me in, in a good way, of course. His trials and tribulations teach a very interesting perspective on the human condition.",Casablanca
537,aladar-219-783287,Casablanca - My Review,8,10 March 2015,"I remember viewing this on iTunes a long while back, when I was in high school. I had obviously heard of it and I was curious about it as a film. I rented it on iTunes and watched it for myself, but at the time I didn't get into it as much as I did now. I couldn't quite follow the story and it was hard to discern because of the history in which this movie was made. Now is a different story.I was very impressed with how this film was presented, because the darks and lights in this film was wonderful, especially with Rick in the bar; very aesthetic and lovely to look at it. That, and having known some of the history now, the movie was so much more enjoyable to watch now that I had a better understanding of what was going on. It was still a bit hard on occasion to catch up to the story but its progression was an interesting one.The one thing that put me off was Rick's character. The actors were apparently German, so his NYC accent was a little funny. I enjoy British TV Shows and notice that some actors who do American-based characters tend to go with this monotone-sounding accent to distinguish an American one from the Northeast. It wasn't bad, but I could tell that he was foreign. That put me off just a little bit, but his acting in general was what made it for me.Witnessing that famous scene at the end was a like a blast from the past. My family has a Disney Vacation membership and I used to go to Disney World every year for several years before stopping when I was 15, and at the time (before MGM was renovated) the Great Movie ride in what is now Hollywood Studios featured that scene from the movie with the airplane and all. I loved the Great Movie Ride, which has since been revised from what I remember from my childhood, but that part of Casablanca was something I could not describe in words. It really made me smile, like it did when I was in the Great Movie Ride. I will return there for my 21st birthday, but I'll miss the way the Great Movie Ride used to be.For the film, though, the rating I gave is not based on what I think it is, but what it deserves. It's a classic of its time and I found its characters so engaging and interesting that I felt like it was an apt rating.",Casablanca
538,hagen2357,Casablanca,9,18 March 2015,"After seeing this film, it's no question as to why this is widely considered to be one of the greatest films ever made. Director Michael Curtiz did essentially everything perfect. The plot, lighting, sounds, and even the political message was clear and well done. Humphrey Bogart (Rick Blaine) did a great job playing a character who is quite powerful and doesn't like to get involved in other peoples affairs. What makes this film so significant is the political message at the time. At this point in history, America attempted to stay out of the affairs of other countries of the world. Rick Blaine represents America in this film. As time went on and the war started to become a threat to our everyday lives, America became involved. As the story of Casablanca goes on, Rick becomes more involved as well. What I also enjoyed about this film is that while so many different things are going on, a simple love story is unwinding and it is quite a good one. Overall, this is one of the best films of that era and would recommend to anyone.",Casablanca
539,m-carter-68742,Amazing,9,25 October 2015,"I've heard only good things about Casablanca and it is easy to see why. Already have been told major things to pay attention to, already have been told memorable parts of the film such as the French National Anthem being played, allowed me to appreciate the film in a more personal way. The love story between Rick and Ilsa was loving, sad, surprising and memorable all wrapped into a nice little bundle. There are indeed some great moments such as the piano playing, the incredible lighting techniques, and even the message of the war time world. Rick, the owner of a bar in Morocco and the main man in the film, is reunited with a former love, Ilsa. You can sense the tension between the two because of Ilsa's new man, and the hurt Rick feels from their days spent together in Paris (which is expressed through his alcohol consumption and late nights after hours at the bar). Though bitter, he still manages to get her, and her boyfriend, to America to ensure their safety from the dangerous Morocco. The story and plot are fantastic, and the wartime message to beat the Nazi's is extremely powerful, and the new lighting/shadows techniques was second-to-none for its time. A watch I recommend for every movie lover.",Casablanca
540,wijajo-72563,Characterful,8,25 August 2021,"A humourous film following the misfits in Casablanca that are trying to escape the war and find pastures new.

541,ninabruzdzinski,Loved it,10,2 March 2016,"I feel like this film is a classic, one that I've always heard people rave about. I'm glad I was finally able to see it, and really enjoyed it. I really like how calm Rick remains when he is being questioned by the German officials. He remains neutral and vague, whilst still staying true to who he is. He never falters or stumbles over his words. I also really like how he doesn't lie either, he has nothing to hide. But once the conversation switches to talk of politics, he politely but firmly excuses himself from the conversation, refusing to discuss politics at his café. The light and shadows of the film were also beautifully done, I especially was a fan of the spotlight on the piano player and the shadows it cast on the rest of the scene.",Casablanca
542,k-ellinger,Casablanca,7,7 March 2016,"Overall, this was a fairly good movie. The lighting and the characters are good enough to create a romantic feel to the movie. This movie would be a good movie for any romantic movie lovers out there. Ricky and Ilsa are old flame that seem to have some serious issues with each other when they meet again at his business. Ilsa tries to get the help from Ricky to help her and her husband, Victor, to help flee the country from the Germans that are on his tail from a crime that he committed. The love that Ricky and Ilsa had for each other obviously still deeply hurt them when they found each other again. Luckily, this movie has a very good movie that is portrayed very well with its ending.",Casablanca
543,CriticalViewing,To be or not to be,8,25 April 2016,"This film caught the nation's attention mid war, it showed Rick, the isolationist, and the woman that would come back into his life, Elsa, that would be the strong enough to prompt him to reconsider his decision and stance on the war. As an isolationist, he refused to get involved, even in the beginning when someone he was familiar with got arrested in his establishment, right in front of him. Even as the man was gripping Rick's shirt pleading for his assistance, Rick remained nonchalant about the whole matter. And when someone else he was familiar and friendly with saw his lack of involvement and said, ""When they come to get me Rick I hope you'll be more of a help"", to which Rick calmly and nonchalantly says, ""I stick my neck out for nobody"", walks away, and goes back to work. But when a blast from the past comes back into his life, Rick is flooded with emotion. First with a piano piece Elsa asks the piano player to play, has Rick storming out of a back room heatedly saying ""I thought I told you to never play that song"". At which point the player points to Elsa, and from then, a switch is flipped within Rick. The use of heavy shadow or lack of it tells the story almost as much as the words of this timely significant film does. The crime for which Rick was pleaded to aid in exempting the man from political consequence, the crime is to be committed by someone very, very close to Rick's heart. This film follows the change (or lack of) in Rick's mind through use of flashback and the course of action he takes in the film to get to the ultimate end of this film in which the ever changing analytical side of Rick becomes set, in which his motives are brought to light, and is 100% decisive in his ultimate decisions. This film was so extremely culturally significant as there were many Rick's in the world, many Americans in the USA and elsewhere making the decision to distance themselves and be thoroughly uninvolved in the events of war; not even wanting to hear about it and those who were very patriotic, fighting and aiding the war effort. This movie explores that in a very realistic way, and on the surface, a very straightforward way, but more in depth, had an all too common complexity that made it very relatable to its audience.",Casablanca
544,Spider-52,"Only ""Casablanca"" can give you that feeling.",10,15 August 1999,"""Casablanca"" is one of those films that just seems to get better and better every time you see it.  Watching it for the second time, I was able to sort of step back and take in the fine details.  The city after which the film is named has got to be the most memorable movie locale of all time.  From Rick's lively bar, to the ominous lighthouse looming in the darkness, to the foggy runway of the airport, the city of Casablanca has more character than many other films have in their characters.As cynical bar owner Rick Blaine, Humphrey Bogart gives arguably his most distinguished performance.  Bogart has the pleasure of delivering some of cinema's most famous lines, and we have the pleasure of receiving them. Ingrid Bergman holds her own against Bogart, although her Ilsa is more subtle.""Casablanca"" is not the greatest film ever made.  However, a very strong argument can be made that it is one of the most entertaining.  ""Casablanca"" is not about flashy directing, powerful acting, or an unpredictable story. It is about its unforgettable characters and dialog, richly detailed locale, and that great feeling you get that cannot be described, and that only ""Casablanca"" can create.",Casablanca
545,hiproductions,has truly lived up to its reputation as a dramatic film for the ages.,8,27 May 2005,"This film is one of the best classic pictures I have ever seen. An interesting story line and compelling performances are what I found so attractive about this movie. Kudos to Curtiz. The set was nearly perfect and was very convincing. I felt the heat of the Moroccan town as the camera swept through the markets in the streets. I was amazed to hear that this was shot almost entirely in a Hollywood studio. I wouldn't have noticed unless I was told otherwise. The song ""As Time Goes By"" was moving even to a former punk/grunge rocker like myself which says something for its power.The topic is very interesting in that it deals with the mystery and intrigue of WWII and the efforts to defeat Nazi tyranny. A beautiful love story was also mixed in with the political refugee plot which held my interest for the entire length of the film. The dialogue was excellent, the best I've seen from the era. This picture was so well written and directed that it would have been great without big name actors and actresses but it was because of the big name cast that it has become the timeless classic that it is.Humphrey Bogart as ""Rick"" was stellar in his performance. I believed the character to be a heart-broken man embittered and buried in self-pity all hidden under the mask of congeniality. This mask is rudely removed by a bottle of liquor. ""You played it for her you can play it for me!"" is only one memorable and dynamic line from this movie that launched the Bogart cult and mystique.Ingrid Bergman as ""Ilsa"" was adorable. I could easily see why two men would both share a common love for her. I was enamored by her delivery and found myself sympathizing with both Rick and Lazlo for losing or almost losing her. This movie has sparked in me an interest for the work of Ingrid Bergman.This was a film I would recommend for anyone who loves the cinema. It has truly lived up to its reputation as a dramatic film for the ages.",Casablanca
546,alooftrashman,One of the Greatest For A Reason,10,10 May 2010,"There's so many reasons to like Casablanca, it's almost immeasurable. But I'm going to try.You've got two acting greats in Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, which play their roles so admirably and naturally you'd swear they were born for these parts.You've got Michael Curtiz, who, besides being an filming legend, went overboard in this film. He used, instead of his great actors, the scenes and shots themselves to move the plot along, a person watching wouldn't necessarily need to know the exact happenings of the entire plot to appreciate the scene - he uses diagetic off-screen sounds perfectly, and the frame always gives you the sense of exactly what's going on in a scene instantly, a rare feat in cinema that I may have seen once or twice prior to this.And of course, there's the thematic overview of what's going on in Europe, at the release of this film swamped in the mire of World War II, this film provides an allegory for what the United States was doing up until that point - staying out of it until they were forced to act. The movie makes it look just as noble when Bogart stands up to the Nazis (this time taking place in a music vs. music overpowering scene), then when the United States actually invades Europe on D-Day.Simply excellent.",Casablanca
547,hsm2310,"Don't just watch it, Be a part of the Epic!",10,20 September 2012,"I have always watched and enjoyed movies produced all over the world but I feel its high time I put my thoughts on paper for the sake of records at least . Also, these will have the potential to create some nostalgic value later.Coincidentally, I watched Casablanca for the first time (emotionally) few days back. The movie which is largely known as one of the greatest love stories of all time is not one, its much more than a mere love story.It is a work of a man who at the time of making this piece seemed to have acquired such levels of skills in his art form that it is next to impossible to be able to find a flaw in this work even for the finest of the observers. How do I even start here? I should very well start with the image which has not left me ever since I have finished watching the movie. There is no doubt that Ingrid Bergman is one of the most naturally beautiful actresses Hollywood has seen in the last century, but in my opinion she is also one of the very few actors who could speak through their eyes exactly what was there in the heart of the character she was playing. This is a skill/gift which is found in a rare breed of actors. The scene where she looks at Rick (Humphrey Bogart) after all those years of separation is a perfect example of the role eyes ought to play to emote ones feelings without utterance of a single alphabet. Its hard to believe how she did not receive an Oscar nomination for this movie as she ended up receiving seven of them in a long glittering career. The prospect of watching all of those is a temptation that can not be defined.I haven't seen all of Bergman's fine performances but in the few that I have seen, one can easily conclude that she has the ability to give multiple layers to her character which is the case in Casablanca as well. The flair with which she has been able to shift between various moods of innocence, mystery and sheer passion is remarkable. Of course, credit must also go to Curtiz who orchestrated this mood dance. The character of Rick is like an iceberg which has been put in fire to melt and vanish and just before it starts to lose its identity it takes inspiration from itself and extinguishes the fire with the water it had lost. There could not have been a better choice for this role than Humphrey Bogart, every square inch of whose countenance reflects the state of mind he is in. Moreover, he is a true style icon in this movie and fits the part to the hilt which pops up the following question: was the role of Rick written for him or he was the best fit for the role!As is seems, the image of protagonists is at the top of my mind their role in the greatness of the movie is certainly not limited to being the faces of the movie. Having said that, below the surface its the work of a master who has engineered multiple components into a giant which overpowers most others in its proximity. This fine piece of work makes its entry straight into the list of Cinema Extraordinaire because of its universal appeal, unique treatment, essentially real yet whimsical script, gripping screenplay and stupendous display of ever changing human behavior.The range of emotions and situations this film has on offer at every stage of the movie makes it a sumptuous and delicious meal for audiences of varying taste. The movie reaches its climax in 95 minutes and it feels like that perfectly timed dessert which is an extremely rare delight. The manner in which any two characters have been linked in this movie is the most unique to say the least. There are many two way relationships which have been portrayed with considerable depth on screen in such a small time that you start wondering by the time movie reaches its final moments that how was it even possible to experience so much in such a short time.Every character leaves an indelible mark even though all it did in the movie was hit a few guitar strings or pick pocket at a restaurant. Every scene in the movie is a study in itself.This is a must watch for anyone who has ever thought of himself as a movie fan. Casablanca without doubt makes its way in my all time top 5 list!www.imnotafilmcritic.blogspot.in",Casablanca

I don't think it is a masterpiece. First of all, the story line is simple, a little interesting. At it's time, the film might have felt fresh and new but now it does not hold the same uniqueness. I love Humphrey Bogart's performance in this film. He is so brilliant. He gets that Rick is charming and at the same time hiding his true feelings. Ingrid Bergman is good, but not brilliant. Sometimes when she is talking about some unfortunate things , she feels kinda fake. Paul Hendrid's performance is very enjoyable. His lines are great and quotes win you over. The other characters give okay performances, nothing breathtaking. The love story does not feel finished and I am not talking about the end. The middle scenes in Paris when they just fall in love automatically seems improbable. The cinematography is very beautiful. One more thing, it is an American propaganda film.",Casablanca

Humphrey Bogart brings his tough but cool persona, Ingrid Bergman brings an elegant but fragile charm, Claude Rains steals every scene he's in with his quick wit and impeccable comedic timing, Conrad Veidt plays the antagonist beautifully and menacingly, Sydney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre provide solid support in smaller roles that show off their shadier sides. The story is just perfect, its complicated so it requires constant attention but it moves by so fast and and never lets up that it is a real joy to watch. This film never has a dull moment, it will have you laughing in one scene and in the next it will have wrenched your heart out. Its shot in a romantic but noir type style that is impossible to take your eyes off of. The music is so moody and romantic it fits the music perfectly and it comes in at all the right moments, never taking away from a scene. The acting never goes over the top or anything, it just stays perfect. The person who I think sticks out the most and embodies the feel of this film would have to be Claude Rains. In one moment he can be so riotously funny and in the next he's as serious as he can be, just like the pace of the film. This really is the perfect movie and I strongly urge anyone who has not seen it to see it.",Casablanca

I never thought that I would see the movie, but now that I have, I am glad. I thought that the lighting was outstanding. The use of the spotlights outside the windows gave it a suspenseful tone. The spotlight on Sam, the piano player, definitely made him stand out. The camera was very versatile, with close-ups and long shots combined in a very artistic and meaningful way. I noticed that the face of Bergman seemed almost perfect through the use of lighting as well. Rick was definitely the protagonist in the movie, but he was not a hero at all. He was mostly concerned about his own well-being throughout the entire movie. The antagonist in the movie was the Nazis. I enjoyed the fact that the movie touched on the fact that the Nazis were human beings as well. It showed the weaknesses that they have. I don't think I have ever seen a film in which the Nazis are portrayed in this way. I also noticed that there was a lot of sound in this movie. The piano was playing almost the entire time, there was singing, and there was humming. It really brought it all together and significantly contributed to the verisimilitude of the film.",Casablanca
552,bellsa037,Casablanca,9,13 March 2010,"In the beginning of the movie, the filmmaker attracts the audience by telling the story which is about the world war 2. However, I noticed something in the scene that the man who had expired passport tried to escape ,and he was shot, but the people around him did not be frightened or feel anything. After that, the story was focus on the bar, and there was the performing of music that was really fantastic. When the camera moved through the instrument or the singer, you would hear the sound of that thing was louder and louder. Besides, I think the vision of this movie is very clear; I can see many details on the background. Furthermore, the filmmaker added the story about the past; I think this is interesting way to tell a story and create the attention of the audience because the audience has to think what was going on, and this also fulfilled the love story perfectly.",Casablanca
553,JamesDean1955,Classic proves itself to be somewhat desirable,7,18 October 2010,"I now can finally say I watched Casablanca. Putting my shame aside for not reviewing this high acclaimed film at an earlier date, i can say that I was half way impressed. Going into the film my expectations were a bit high, so that could have something to do with my final thoughts. I expected my mind to be blown, and to a certain degree i suppose it was. This was my first exposure to the legendary actor, Humphrey Bogart, and i was surely impressed. His acting is simply legendary and for me, he made the entire movie. The visuals were also very eye appealing. I must admit that about midway through i did get a little lost, and tried to regain focus but just couldn't. I mainly focused and was sort of awed by the presence of Humprey Bogart, his style on the screen is intriguing, smooth, and something to look up to.",Casablanca
554,Challenger2013,One of the Best Films of All Time,10,20 April 2015,"I'm going to tell you all what you already probably know: ""Casablanca"" is one of the greatest films of all time. However, there is something that most probably have never even considered. If you look at all the elements that make up this film, it could be considered the best of a number of genres. It could be considered the best noir film, the best thriller, and even the best war film ever. And I'll tell you right now that it sure as hell is the best romance ever put on screen. ""Casablanca"" has it all and it never gets old. The plot is timeless. Humphrey Bogart plays Rick Blaine, a self-proclaimed ""drunkard"" and American living in Africa during World War II after being forced out of Paris by Nazi oppression. He's a mysterious fugitive, and he runs a bar and gambling joint as a loner. One day, a woman named Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) walks in with the famous Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). The scene that follows between Rick, Ilsa, and Rick's piano player Sam (Dooley Wilson), is perfect. Rick is shocked to see her and emotion flows from the scene from all three characters. These emotions include surprise, fear, and anger. As we learn the backstory, a romance between Rick and Ilsa in Paris, we become closer to each character. Not just Rick and Ilsa, but Victor too. We are caught in a love triangle for the ages. Both men love Ilsa and Ilsa loves both men. Should she stay in Casablanca with Rick or should she go to America with Victor? Should Rick give Victor the transfer papers he is hiding from the Germans or keep them for himself? These are the questions that appear and it is thrilling to see them answered. The biggest strength of the film is the plot, driven by an excellent screenplay. There's a reason this film contains five or six of the most famous quotes in film history. We never get tired of hearing Bogart say ""Heres looking at you, kid."" Speaking of Bogart, he and Bergman give tremendous performances as the star-crossed lovers and they are supported by some wonderful supporting performances, especially that of Claude Rains as Captain Renault. The film is shot beautifully. Other than Citizen Kane, it is probably the best display of black-and-white in the history of American cinema. Nothing is particularly spectacular or special about it, but it is done so flawlessly. ""Casablanca"" is deservedly heralded as an ultimate classic because it does so much near- perfectly. Ultimately, its influence is still felt everywhere today. We've all heard the lines from the film. We all think of the film when we hear of the location. The problem is that so many people today reference these influences without ever seeing the film or even knowing that they come from the film. It really is a shame, considering how well the film has aged and could still affect audiences of this generation. ""Casablanca"" was and still is a film ahead of its time and will continue to amaze us all as we watch it over and over again.",Casablanca
555,kendraocon,Not as good as I expected!,7,11 October 2012,"This movie was not as good as I expected it to be. I think that the cinematographer's moves were great though. He had a lot of techniques involved in it. He used a tilt shot, showing the plane in the sky then the camera was tilted to show the men and women watching the sky. I thought it was a nice move, it was missing any pieces there because it was a nice clean shot. They use low key lighting, were the shadows were almost over emphasized. The women were highlighted and shown in a beautiful way, especially Isla. They also made sure she didn't have too many harsh shadows on her face. They had the perfect tonal range in the light, that helped show the emotions of the characters the best. The director had used a lot of minor characters , which confused me a bit. I was confused between Rick and Victor, I found that there was not much a strong difference between the two of them that really stood out to me.The cinematographer always used the best techniques to show of the characters, in the beginning showing off Sam in the restaurant they start off at a far distance, but then gradually zoom in almost as if it is a slow motion shot of Sam singing and playing the piano.",Casablanca
556,yilmazomar,Beginning of The Golden Age of Hollywood,10,19 October 2012,"The sets, costumes and designs were absolutely gorgeous. Each shot in each scene was carefully composed and mathematically balanced, there was a symmetry to shapes and buildings and the way in which they were captured. The lighting was incredibly clean and succinct, objects were so smooth and defined I couldn't believe my eyes. I also think the camera movements like quick zooms or when the camera moved up to a character, or shots like of the entire club were revolutionary and you can definitely see the influence of the camera work in later films. I feel like this is the film or one of the films in which our cinematic history transitions into the modern period with acting and camera-work the kind that were used to, the film strangely didn't feel old to me it looked and flowed like it could have been made yesterday. The plot itself isn't bad, it's suspenseful and exciting and interesting, Bogart and Bergman are talented actors but Bogart stood out to me the most. You can see his influence on later actors portraying dark disturbed men in historical films or action films or a combination of both.",Casablanca
557,uziesuzie,Heres looking at you. ..kid?,8,15 March 2013,"The diegetic and non-diegetic music in the film created so many different atmospheres. Humphrey Bogart ""Rick"" always has a cast of shadow on one side of his face, but ""Ilsa"" Ingrid Bergman face is always so well lit and beautiful. I know it's a big famous line, but really It creeped me out that Bogart's character kept saying ""Here's looking at you kid"" to Ilsa. She looked like a women to me. Doesn't seem right for an older man to be romantic with a kid? It was impressive how so much was going on between so many different characters and it all blended together smoothly. Wonderful film that i would like to watch again, to understand more of the politics involved.",Casablanca
558,v-colarusso,The perfect movie,10,4 May 2013,"Casablanca is a classic that defines film at its greatest. This has pretty much become common knowledge. The film has many dimensions inside its story. The romance between Rick and Ilsa is unique and fantastic, but this film is much more than a love story. It's a story of redemption, glory, and enlightenment. The social implications in the film are very relevant for the time period its in. The script is one of the best parts of the film by far. The dialog is beautiful and poetic. As much as auteur directors are well-respected and usually more liked than directors with no distinct flare, Michael Curtiz directed some wonderful films without the audience being aware of his direction.",Casablanca
559,westersnows,Casablanca (1942),9,26 March 2014,"I have always loved this film, and I will continue to love it indefinitely. There's nothing that I have a problem with, which is really unusual. The story is great, the atmosphere is great, and the photography is SPECTACULAR (I love the shadows and the lamps). And Bogart and Bergman are perfect. There's just enough mystery to keep it going at a steady pace. The dialogue is good too- - entertaining and witty, but it's not out of this world. I also like that the ending differs from the expected, leaving the audience intentionally disappointed that Rick doesn't go with Ilsa (in a good and necessary way, I think). Okay, I lied; there is one little thing that bothers me. I appreciate this film more from an aesthetic standpoint —I don't get much emotional connection to it.",Casablanca
560,john-hogan23,"""Of all the whiskey bars in all of Northwest Africa she decides to visit my establishment""",9,15 October 2014,"Casablanca is the story of an American man in WWII era Morocco and his struggle in choosing between ""love and virtue"". Confronted by the woman he once loved and her new husband, a Czech resistance leader and important figure in the fight against the Nazis, the film focuses on Rick's internal conflict over deciding between his desires or the good of many others.Casablanca is a testament to what you can accomplish with a spectacular cast and a beautiful, thoughtfully made set. The vast majority of the film takes place in Rick's Cafe Americain and focuses on a handful of characters, but even with it's relatively crowded story it never fails to feel well rounded and entirely better off than if were to use a wider array of characters and locations.Humphrey Bogart stars as Rick Blaine, the owner of Rick's Cafe Americain. Bogart gives the film a career defining performance and makes his character the most compelling male lead I've ever seen in a love story. When dealing with the politics brought into the Cafe Americain he's cool, calm, and composed in his efforts to remain neutral in all matters, but when we see him alone after hours in his office he becomes very convincingly distraught over his love interest Ilsa. He is shown on multiple occasions alone in his office shrouded by the complete darkness of a Casablancan night, with only a thin ray of light shining through a window to illuminate his face. He drinks from a tall bottle of booze with a grim, haunted expression that gave me a real empathy for the toll his endeavors were taking on him. The rest of the cast performed well enough that there were no noticeable weak links, but there was really no way for them to escape the shadow cast by Bogart's performance.My favorite thing about the film was Rick's Cafe Americain. The Cafe itself was just a series of sets constructed in Warner Brothers Studios in Burbank California, but it was so fitting and perfect for the film it left the same kind of impression that would be made by a well made fantasy location. Its stone walls were decorated in the shadows left by ornate lamps and intricate patterns made to shine light in from the outside. It was so packed full of extras during all of the scenes taking place there that it always created the atmosphere of a real bar. These things were vital to the film because so much of it was contained within these walls, and it was so great that I loved every moment of the scenes there.Casablanca is a real classic. It's the sort of movie that feels like an experience and makes you glad you've seen it. It was all so excellent that I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who loves movies. When you see some of these scenes for yourself you immediately understand how they've had such a lasting influence to this day.",Casablanca
561,m-meehan-28239,Casablanca,7,9 March 2016,This movie was awfully significant in its timing since it was at the height of the war. It was a very emotional film. I can't imagine what seeing this movie would be like at the time not knowing the outcome of the war. The back story alone is exciting. The movie itself was also entertaining. The use of shadow and what seemed like dim lighting really added to the tension and drama of the plot. I also appreciated the use of flashback in the film which was not common at the time. Everything about this movie was great for capturing the attention of the audience. The character development was great since there was a history between the two and the emotion was conveyed strongly in the eyes of each character when the light would shimmer off their tears. This allowed the viewers To almost feel the pain and love felt by the characters.,Casablanca

563,KubricksRube,"One of Hollywood's best, Bogart's second-best performance (SPOILERS)",10,1 July 2004,"This is a great movie, and one of the best examples of the Golden Age.  The movie works not only because of a great script, great cast, and great minimalist direction, but because it provides an excellent sense of time and place.  Few movies are so directly linked to the time in which they were made.  In 1942 the outcome of the war was a question mark, as was the Nazi threat.  This movie was made when nobody was sure who would win, and it shows.  The desperation of the characters, from Rick himself to bit parts that receive only five seconds of screen time, comes across perfectly without being over-stated or glossed over to give the love triangle more screen time.  In fact, forget the love triangle, the real struggle in this movie is in Rick (though as this movie's script is so heavily analyzed by every film school in the country, I'm probably not saying anything new).Few major Hollywood productions have such human characters.  Nobody in this movie is an archetype, they are all flawed, they make mistakes, and most importantly they will all redeem themselves in some way (except for the Nazis, who would certainly not be shown redeeming themselves in a war-time movie).  Sydney Greenstreet is a criminal, and proud of it, yet he decides to give Ilsa and Victor some helpful information, admitting that he doesn't see how it helps him.  Claude Rains is a despicable pig who uses his authority to get sexual favors from desperate women, and he too is proud of this, yet at the end he also redeems himself.Some people have said that this movie has the best supporting cast in history, and they may be right.  The Bulgarian girl, Rick's staff, Peter Lorre, Victor Laszlo, Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, Sam, and the Nazi who looks like Porky Pig with a monocle.  I said in the header that this is Bogart's second-best performance, and the first would be Treasure of the Sierra Madre (you saw that coming, I'm sure).Unfortunately a lot of the dramatic impact of this movie, especially the finale, will be ruined for many younger viewers like myself, because it is so endlessly quoted and imitated in other movies, books, tv shows, etc. This is a darn shame.  Nevertheless, I gave this movie a 10/10.",Casablanca
564,xoxascott,SMART,9,13 November 2019,Genius. That is the best way to describe this movie. Everything is so meticulously put together to create something extraordinary. This movie is all about the subtle messaging so you really need to focus while watching. Also Humphrey Bogart is an acting GOD. The movie is a jumper that never lets up and grips the emotions like few others. The acting is near-perfect and its setting in WW2 makes it easily relatable since the war is an extremely well known historical event. Highly Recommended.,Casablanca

If you prefer Citizen Kane however, do the opposite.Both are good, but who wins by our vote? What is the greatest American film of the 1940s? Or is it neither Casablanca, nor Kane?

The city of Casablanca has an interesting mix of people. Some of the details about the letters of transit and the role of the Germans get a bit confusing, but I'm sure it would be more clear in a second watch.
There is a scene of drinking in the dark with at the piano that is beautifully shot, The light s coming in from, the ,moving spotlight and the smoke of his cigarette is illuminated in a subtle way, and his face is mostly in shadow. It reflects his somber reflection in a really artistic way.

It is extremely well known with many, many people having seen it and even more having heard of it. Throughout the years many films have been called a ""masterpiece"" and have stood against time and retained their popularity. However very few films, Casablanca included, have not only survived throughout the years but have thrived. This film accurately depicts the stress and anxiety of those trying to survive the Nazi's during World War 2. In the end Rick's legacy is not defined by his loneliness but by his willing to commit one selfless deed for the woman he still loves. ""Here's looking at you, Casablanca.""",Casablanca

Through the course of the film he runs into Ilsa, the woman he left in Paris years before, though she was upset with him she couldn't stay away therefore involving themselves with each other again.This film is deemed a classic but it definitely has to be watched more than once to understand the plot and the storyline, it's a well-filmed movie but it's very easy to get lost in the storyline itself. I felt myself getting lost and to be perfectly honest I probably wouldn't watch this film again, not that it was bad but because it wasn't of my interest.",Casablanca
569,Amym-24,Good Film to Watch,8,15 October 2009,"Individuals are always dealing with war inside themselves. Whether it's a war between jealousy, self-centered behavior,neutrality,fear, or love, it's important for people to let go of those emotions and go for those feelings that are within your heart, even if it hurts you, or if you have contradicting feelings about someone or something. People can't always hide from their feelings. They have to go out into the world and release them to the person that an individual cares about.Bogart's acting portrays all of these characteristics well in this movie. The entire acting in the movie was great and well timed. The romantic twists throughout the film were good,romantic, and very suspenseful as the viewers are glued into the interesting triangle between Rick,Ilsa, and Victor.The cinematography throughout the movie was good with a balance of soft lighting on the lead woman,bright, sharp focused contrast on the leading men as throughout the interior and exterior scenes, and the dark, gloomy, climatic clear contrast on Bogart's face was well shown to display his saddened angry mood at Ilsa's betrayal at the train station. The use of the piano, live bands, and recorded music was used well throughout the film. The use of depth of field was used well.If you're interested in watching a romantic suspenseful drama, then this movie would be a great film to watch.",Casablanca

The unforeseen circumstances for which they fall in love sets the standard and the bar for all romance movies. No one will ever really truly cultivate your feelings of love and compassion like that of this movie. It is truly magnificent to watch the turmoil and decisions that face Bogart throughout the film. You can literally feel Bogart's heart fall onto the table when Bergman is seen at his club in Casablanca and the realism in the film is truly sensational.This movie was one of the first to truthfully portray realism in film and shows the world of realism in fiction. It is exceptionally beautiful how they portrayed that love can come to anyone at anytime in any situation. Sometimes that means everything else doesn't matter.The acting that Bogart and Bergman possess and show while Sam plays their song,it shows you of two lost lovers longing for answers and there will to never give up on each other despite the unforeseen circumstances that have fallen upon them.",Casablanca

However, anytime I had seen a movie that had received such high praise, such as Citizen Kane, I was disappointed. Maybe my expectations for Casablanca were lower because of that, or maybe because for some reason I always assumed it was nothing more than a girly film, but the movie far exceeded my expectations, and I must agree that it is one of the greatest films of all time.The movie is so much more than a love story. Elements of suspense and conflict between good and evil make this story work. Bogart's character is even a social commentary on American isolationism, and what good can be achieved when he opens his heart and sticks his neck out for someone.The dialog is not only brilliant, but masterfully delivered by Bogart and Rains. I think Rains performance is highly underrated, and my favorite in the film.

Ehhh, maybe but probably not since i'm going to have a hard time stretching this review out to 10 lines. Luckily, Bogart's performance gives me something to talk about because, as always, his acting is captivating. Without he and Bergman this film would fall flat. The romance is pretty cheesy and formulaic. Plug in any attractive blonde and she could play Ilsa and any big brute of a man could play Laszlo. Hell, the fact that Peter Lorre's character was more interesting than Laszlo speaks volumes to the nature of this film. It's a good movie without a doubt but i just don't get the common tag of greatest film of all time. The only thing really stopping me from giving this movie lower than a 7 is Bogart. He just draws you in as an actor and i can't remember the last bad film i watched with him in it.",Casablanca

So many iconic moments in this film, so many famous quotes, it's hard to believe its all in the same film. This film tells a wonderful story of a place where nobody wants to be, and everyone is trying to escape from the grip of Nazi Germany. This film does a wonderful job of portraying a place that is habitable, but hellish, where everyone settles with whatever they can get, trying desperately to get enough to get out. It also tells a beautiful love story, and helps to back up the phrase ""If you love something, set it free"". Rick must let the woman he loves leave for America with another man, so that she may escape from the hellhole that is Casablanca, and be with the man to whom her heart now truly belongs. One scene in particular that I absolutely loved was the scene in the bar, where Victor starts everyone up singing the French national anthem in order to drown out the Germans singing.

The story is nothing new (even for 1942) and the ending is as unrealistic as it gets. Yeah, like Bogart would really just immediately try to save the guy who's with the love of his life? Even under the circumstances, it just seems far-fetched. There are some good things about the film. I think the acting is fairly decent and there are few people that would disagree that the dialog is top-notch.

There are a lot of foreign actors in this film as well. It was a great way to portray the message the director was trying to get across which was that the world needed Americas help during the war. This movie although iconic and well known can have its true purpose easily looked over by a viewer today. But back when the film was made it had a huge impact on the views of the war. The sets for each scene are done very well even though most take place in the main characters night club. It has a bit of an eerie feeling added to it from the dim lighting which increase the suspense of the film and add a shady feeling to it.

The movie was interesting. Was it the best movie I ever saw in my life? Uhh, not really. The main thing is that is kept me captivated (almost forgot I was watching it) and I was able to relate to parts of the film. When a movie is able to do that, create a relatable feeling for its audiences, then it's a winner. Casablanca was a real love story. Not this fluff that we see now a days that have the same concept and the same story line. I loved this films mise-en-scene. The props and effects used made the setting seem so real.

What makes this film even better is the fact that no one thought that it would be anything out of the ordinary, when in fact it is perhaps one of the best known films, with one of the best known and recreated scenes in the film. This film should also get credit for being mainly shot in a studio, meaning that it is a studio production. The director, Cutiz, did a great job at making it seem as though this was an on sight, on location film, when it was not.

In the end, Rick forces the captain to allow Victor and Ilsa to go to America while he stays behind. This shows how much he loves Ilsa because he wants the best for her even though it meant her going with Victor. A scene that was good in the movie was the national anthems being played in the café. The German's started singing their national anthem. Then Rick cued everyone else to do the French national anthem. This is a key scene because it shows the people actually standing up against the Germans and their invasions. The relationship with Rick and the Captain was also good too.

Casablanca is a movie that is famous all around the world for its iconic love story, but few people talk about the political message that the movie sends. In a time of despair for the nation, this movie was made to show hope for the loyal citizens. This movie showed that there was a light at the end of the dark tunnel that people were living in. The love story definitely adds to the effect and serves as a distraction from the overall message. The use of light in this movie adds to the way it is perceived. In many of the dramatic scenes, the entire room is dark except for a light that shines perfectly on the face of the actor in frame. The lights not only add to the beauty of the actors themselves, but adds to the drama in the movie.

The films atmosphere is presented flawlessly as well. The set is crafted with fine detail. The lightning and direction is amazing.

The characters in Casablanca are so well played and well rounded that it would be hard not to build a bond to each of them by the end of the movie. Humphrey Bogart's role of Rick Blaine is my favorite character by far. His gritty attitude is accompanied by a softer side. The love triangle between Rick, Isla, and Victor really portray Rick's softer side when he ends up choosing to help Ilsa and Rick instead of himself. Another character that I thought was well played was Sam by Dooley Wilson, I liked the funny side he provided to the movie and also the life advice he always ends up helping Rick with.

585,simranpersaud,casablanca review,9,27 October 2020,Calablanca is a well known film and rightfully so. The starting of the film gives you a voiceover of the cities significance. As the movie progresses it gets into the romance between the characters and also the escape and fight against the germans. Its a movie of a combination of love and sacrifice. This was a great film and one I would recommend to others to watch if they haven't,Casablanca
586,c-stewart-44611,"Movie Review ""Casablanca"" History of American Cinema 272 520",8,10 October 2020,"""Casablanca"" is a movie everyone has heard of. Many people consider it legendary, as it has won three Oscars including Best Picture. It was set in set in the present day of 1942 with WWII as the backdrop to this romantic but quirky drama. Humphrey Bogart who plays Rick, a club owner, finds himself in Casablanca due to mysterious reasons which were never really told. Ingrid Bergman plays an old girlfriend named Ilsa that accidentally stumbles back into Rick's life in Casablanca. This film does a great job in slowly developing the backstory that explains why Rick and Ilsa were no longer together. The story written by Julius Epstein, and directed by Michael Curtiz, weaves its way through multiple scenarios and possibilities for the characters to take. It is not until the very end that you truly know how Rick is going to handle the tricky situation he finds himself in. I thought this was a great film for the early 40s and it still holds up today.",Casablanca
587,atmoore-75075,Movie Review: Casablanca,7,7 October 2020,"Casablanca's is an old WWll movie that puts forth an interesting premise and that forces our main character Rick to choose between two things, the women that he loves, or to help her and her husband escape the country because he is a famed rebel and wanted by the germans. With a plot like this it can really suck you into this story and really see how these characters interact with each and the world around them. The World War ll setting really gives this sense of urgency, that places our main characters on a time limit and they must figure out what they are going to do very quickly. And as someone who likes history I can really appreciate the World War ll setting and this movie, even though I am not a big fan of the romance aspect. I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes history around the World War ll era, or even to people that like a drama filled romance movie with a gripping plot.",Casablanca
588,c-hendron,Casablanca - 1942,10,21 October 2020,"This is truly one of the greatest classics of film. The story is non-stop and keeps you intrigued up until they very iconic ending. The film itself has quite the unique atmosphere, where every character knows everybody else's business. Despite this, every major character is trying to figure out what the others are going to do. The chemistry of all the major characters is amazing, and the performances from Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart are incredible. I love that we don't truly know what Rick is going to do until the very end of the film, but you also kind of knew all along that he would do the right thing. This is truly a master class in story telling and I would recommend that everybody watches this film at least once, even if just for the ending.",Casablanca

591,k-cronin,"""Here's lookin' at you kid.""",9,14 October 2009,"This is such a classic movie. So many quotes that I have heard throughout my life I now know came from this film. I believe the overall message of this film was that you should do what is best for those you love even if you don't want to. Sometimes you have to be selfless. Since it was set in December of 1941 when Pearl Harbor was happening another over all message to the film was that America needs to join the war. This movie was such a similitude- I really believed in the movie and the characters. I felt the movie was heartfelt and certain parts I really felt like I could feel the characters feelings. The sound was wonderful. The scene where the plane was taking off in the beginning was great. As the plane rose over them on the porch you could hear the engine steady, the roar the higher the plane went. The protagonist in this film was Bogart. He was also the main character, you just felt him. Felt his pain, his sorrow, his love, and throughout the whole film the view was on his side. I noticed there was a lot of layering with the camera and the back round scenes. Some were very good and detailed and others you could tell the background was just a back drop that they altered in some way or another. This was a captivating movie. I believe the beautiful lighting had a lot to do with that. There were many parts in this film where there was low key lighting. Very few high key lighting scenes, but the low key made the movie that much more believable. I noticed, and i may be wring, but the only spots where there was a lot of high key lighting was when the theme song played. The lead woman in the film had very distinct lighting throughout the film. It was background lighting to soften her face. Over all I thought this was a good movie. It was quick paced, kept the viewer involved and interested in the film and the characters.",Casablanca
592,james-m-donohue,As good as people say it is.,9,21 October 2009,"I usually find it hard to watch Bogart movies. It is not because I don't like him. It is because he's such a good actor that he usually makes everyone else look like a horrible actor in comparison. This is especially the case in Maltese Falcon. Luckily, most of the other main characters were good enough to compete. Ingrid Bergman was a great female lead. Peter Lorre was able to break out of his self-made cliché and become more than a simple sidekick though it still seems impossible with his character voice.The sound was really good as well. A piano would often be played in the background to help create a feeling that there was a lot going on that wasn't being seen which made the world around them feel more rich and alive.The special effects were good for the time as well. Considering the time period, scenes which would show the characters watching a plane fly looked pretty realistic. The lighting was the true visual gem. The whole movie felt like modern painting. I always had my eye trained on the screen looking for how my attention would be grabbed. There was one shot where Humphrey Bogart was opening his safe. To bring attention more towards Bogart while also showing and establishing the other character's presence, Bogart only had his shadow shown to imply his presence while making him look more highlighted. Every shot in some way was supposed to trick the viewer into seeing what the director wanted to be seen and only that.It also had a great yet subtle message about honor and what someone or some people should do just because it is the right thing to do like go to war and that sometimes it is selfish to not enter a war rather than not.I could probably go on and on for 10 pages, but this is the best I can do while being concise and also while not revealing too many spoilers. This should be seen by almost everyone just so that an opinion can be formed. It is that important of a movie.",Casablanca

For people watching this movie for the first time without knowing anything about it will be shocked to see what happens at the end. I know I was the first time I saw this movie! At first it upset me because I wanted there to be a happy ending, but after realizing what Rick had done for Ilsa it made me so happy! The acting was amazing in this; very believable and very smooth. I think Humphery Bogart was really amazing in this movie. He played his character very well and made the character relatable! His character did a lot of developing in the movie as well! I would recommend this movie to any one! Such a great film!",Casablanca

At first I could not understand why some odd romance film was so important but after watching it now I see. Part of it is writing, the excellent dialogue that ranges from somber and disheartening to clever hilariousness. Another piece of it is the beauty of a story that always keeps you guessing right up to to end with twists. Last is the top notch acting, this is the film that made Bogart's career and it is easy to see why. Realizing now the significance of WHEN this film was released in relation to its content makes me understand how valid the social commentary was.",Casablanca

I thought the story line drag a little in some parts, and I may stand alone in that however the visuals I think made up for my lack in interest. This movie was shot in black and white and I don't think it could have been better in any other way, the black and white added glamor and beauty to a lot of the scenes. Also the lighting was key in this movie, a lot of the lighting was soft lighting especially when Ingrid Bergman was the focus of the frame. The image had a soft filter and it gave Bergman this innocent and glow. Using the soft lighting in this movie also added to the romantic mood of a lot of the scenes. The use of shadows was also very apparent in this movie. One scene that used low key lighting was when Bergman is up in Humphrey Bogarts room hiding, the lights are off and she has a large shadow casting across her, this use of shadow gives us the tone of the scene, and really insist that she must stay hidden in the shadows. Casablanca also uses high key and hard lighting in the film to create crisp and clear pictures as well. Soft and hard lighting will even be used in the same scene. An example of this being used is in the ending scene when Bogart is saying goodbye to Bergman's character. The camera will do a close up of Bogarts face and it will be in hard lighting, the image is very clear and crisp of his face, we can see every wrinkle under his eyes and such, however when the shot switches to a close up of Bergman's face we see her in a soft lighting like I have mentioned before. This make her look young and glowy. The contrast is very apparent and really sets the two characters apart. Casablanca is a classic movie and I urge you to pay a lots of attention to the images and photography on the screen!",Casablanca

This film is an absolute masterpiece, and is probably the finest film every created. It would be sacrilege to not include this on any ""All Time Top 10"" lists, because it is simply that good. A film doesn't just start out as being a stunning work of art, but with all of the directorial talent, and especially the work of Humphrey Bogart in the lead role, this is it.

The club ran by Rick is the main setting for the movie. The sound is mesmerizing, especially the piano playing by Sam. The lighting is dark, and definitely exudes a noir quality. The scene where Rick is drinking at his bar all alone with Sam,you can see the chandeliers reflecting light. It was a nice touch to the mood of the scene.

The nightlife in Casablanca itself feels so lively since the nightclub that is owned by Rick Blaine is always filled with people. Not only that but the characters in the film have character development which is something I am always glad to see in films.

Although it is certainly a classic romance, the fact that such a serious even was occurring around it made it a lot darker than romantic movies commonly are. I thoroughly enjoyed the use of black and white in this film, as well. Arthur Edeson did a wonderful job making sure that the way this film was shot, really captured everything that was going on around them. Flashing back when Rick and Ilsa were together and madly in love, the tones were so much lighter than the present time heartbroken and troubled pair. When Rick is sitting alone in his café listening to Sam play ""their song,"" there isn't a single light directly on him. The brightest lights in that scene came from the cars passing by outside the bar. This film was so incredibly beautiful, and so beautifully shot, I can certainly understand the common hype about it.

She is now married to resistance leader Victor Laszio (Paul Henreid) on the run from the Germans. Bogart can help by supplying them with the vital transit papers they desperately need to escape to America but is he willing to do that when his policy has always been: ""I stick my neck out for nobody""? In addition he still holds strong feelings for Bergman so will this influence his decision?One of the great Warner Bros. films of the forties - possibly the most productive decade in the history of Hollywood .... and how about all those ""classic lines""?

He never wanted to get involved, but it became necessary. The audience can't help but feel for him and Ilsa; their pain, pity and pride feel so real through the screen.

Rick and Ilsa have a dynamic where they don't want to relive the past, but they do miss each other and Ilsa feels guilty for what happened and why she did what she did. I like how the movie went into a flashback for this relationship between Rick and Ilsa and it shows why Rick is the type of person he is in Casablanca. The cinematography was crisp and there were a lot of details in the sets that were used. I like how the characters were thought out like their personality especially throughout the movie where we see some character development.

In Casbalanca Ricks Café is the spot to go and where most of the action takes place, including illegal activity. The owner Rick Blaine played Humphrey Bogart could be described as cold, witty, and self interested. He does not seem to be close with anyone or have any real friends. Early in the film he lets Ugarte(:Peter Lorre) get arrested after they had a mutual understanding about his attempting to escape from Casablanca. After this he doesn't seem phased, which makes you wonder who hurt him. Incomes Ilsa Lund who's played by Ingred Bergman. Ilsa and Rick had a relationship in Paris which ended unexpectedly in Paris when Rick was forced to leave due to Nazi Occupation. Ilsa husband Victor Laszlo(Paul Henreid) was a man of great character who was a thorn in the third riechs side. His mere presence throws Rick of his game and actually makes a deal with the nazi's that would turn over Victor and allow him to leave the Casablanca with Ilsa. At the end in contrast with his self interested personality he with a gun persuades Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains) to let Ilsa and Victor to leave the country.Casablanca is a movie where you can see the transition of film making. There are layers to the layers of this film that previous eras of film making did not possess. The film also illustrates the eeriness the Nazi regime brought to the places occupied and unoccupied. It was a smoothly told story with good context to why characters are the way they are. This Film reminds me of modern day movies therefore i'd call it a film ahead of its time.",Casablanca

After watching this film I fell in love, I was enchanted and dazzled by its beauty. Humphrey Bogart stars as Rick, a complicated man with a heart breaking past.The scenes that took place in Rick's restaurant were especially stunning because they look and feel so different at times depending on the situation. During business hours the restaurant is a happening place and these scenes were always loud, bright, high in contrast and flashy. The scenes in Rick's office and when the restaurant was closed were usually dark and quiet; feeling more personal. The focus of the camera also had a different feel while shooting certain characters. A soft focus was used while shooting Ingrid Bergman's character Ilsa, making her even more gorgeous.The ending of Casablanca is really quite amazing because it is meant to feel incomplete.

Saying this I love the use of flashbacks to show important parts of the film. I also just love the styling of 40's everyone just is dressed as fancy as they could just a great moment in America's history. The film also has a great love story which is such a relief to see because most films love stories are just way to sappy or overdone, I feel it was just perfect to fit the mood of the film and the moments that were happening of the world.

There aren't enough superlatives in the dictionary to describe just how perfectly the story, the characters, the images, the music, the sounds and all elements of the film's production are presented. The thing that sets Casablanca apart from the other films universally considered as being among the greatest of all time including Citizen Kane(1941) and The Godfather Part I(1972)and Part II(1974), among others, is the comedy of the piece. To balance the heart wrenching and soul shattering effects of war, occupation, fascism, betrayal and lost love with so much high quality comedy and so many great jokes is just stunning. Importantly, the comic elements disarm the audience without distracting from the life and death tension of the surroundings of the film. The emotions of the piece all feel very real and genuine and the audience is allowed into the lives of these characters in a way that very few films allow. Bogart's Rick is just about the coolest guy in the history of the world and Bergman's Ilsa it just about the most beautiful and charming woman in the history of the world. Claude Rains contributes a masterfully enigmatic performance as the police Captain Louis Renault and the entire cast of characters makes the place and the era come bursting to life. Curtiz's use of light and shadows sets the perfect tone for this perfect film and all elements of production are perfectly on point. I can't say for certain that Casablanca is the greatest film that has ever been made as I haven't seen them all but there's a pretty damn good chance that it is.",Casablanca

But when it was on TV, I felt compelled to, and even though I was watching it a few days later, I am definitely glad that I did. The story is absolutely timeless, and it is something that could even happen nowadays. Bogart's Rick is still in love with Bergman's married Ilsa, who has come to Casablanca with her husband (Laszlo) so they they can escape to America, and away from the Nazi's who are after Laszlo. Throughout this time, Rick is torn between whether or not to help them escape, while wanting Ilsa all to himself. Bergman and Bogart both display such amazing acting skills, making the viewer really feel that they are in love. You can see Ilsa being torn between Laszlo and Rick and not knowing what to do as much as Rick doesn't know what to do. Aside from the story, the setting is really quite beautiful as well. The town of Casablanca, was just a really nice place to set the movie, and whenever anyone hears the name of the town, all people seem to think about is love.",Casablanca

The cinematography had it great expose lighting. The portraits of characters were strongly detailed. I loved staring at the costume and production designing. The costumes were appropriate for each character on set. It looked formal. I think the picture deserves a remake like the 1962 film Cape Fear. I felt like Humphrey Bogart had the same role like he does in other noir movies. Michael Curtiz captured the setting of Casablanca beautifully such as the palm trees, architecture and the Arab clothing. I enjoyed the other setting in the title, that was Paris. The French culture was shot in deep detail. You could acknowledge how the French citizens lived and how they suffered during the Second World War.

I knew the big ending and pretty much the entire plot going in. It made it a little harder for me to get emotionally connected to what was happening. The best surprise for me was just how much I loved the relationship between Rick and Louie. I can see now why this is an iconic friendship. Tied to this, I loved the message that every ending has its own beginning as Rick and Louis walk off into the mist together. It's a nice change of pace in a day where the end of every film ends with the couple riding off into the sunset. Here, we have the opposite, but it didn't leave me feeling remotely sad or cheated. I was satisfied with knowing Rick had made the right decision and that he had Louis at his side.",Casablanca
617,pete-470,Why does this film work?,10,7 August 2020,"It's old
It's black and white
It's a romance (bleah)All these things are reasons which make it difficult for me to look forward to enjoying. Don't get me wrong.. there are plenty of films that fall into one or more of these categories that are 'alright' but many of the films of the era have dated badly. This is timeless. It makes me laugh a lot but I also find it very emotional. Not just because of the story or its' brilliant performances, but because of its perfection. I could draw on any scene, many of which have been written about a thousand times. My view would be worthless. The more I watch it though, the more I realise the film is about Ilsa and my favourite shot is the steady camera on her face as Sam sings As Time Goes By. The turmoil of her memories and love for Rick and her loyalty and love for Victor Laszlo are laid bare with no dialogue or flashback.Watch it if you haven't. There is a depth to it that gives it a richness that is so rare in film. I can guarantee it won't be the last time.",Casablanca
618,hourmatt326,Casablanca Review,7,15 October 2014,"I enjoyed most of Casablanca. I thought that the performances were good and it was just a beatify shot film. The story was the only the only problem for me. the pacing was too fast and I couldn't really get into it and then it just ends. The ending wasn't my favorite either with him sacrificing his love for the girl to be happy was predicable to me and didn't leave me ""wow-ed"" by it. I think if the pacing was better put together it would be more appealing and easier to follow I would've enjoyed the movie more than I did, but the performances, music and looks of the film help it to be a good movie. That is why I give Casablanca a 7/10.",Casablanca
619,Mustaveli,Superb setting,9,18 October 2014,"So far, this movie has the best lighting I've ever seen. Everything worked so well that I don't think I'd have to see the movie in color. My favorite thing about it was how the lights outside of the club worked so well. Nothing was too saturated, and you could tell what was what, and who was who. Even characters who were darker than others were seen well, and that's something big with me. Sure, the movie was a little cheesy but I honestly liked it. Rick's character is probably my favorite, and both he and Lund were extremely good looking throughout the whole thing. It was a bit disappointing that they didn't get together in the end, especially with how their previous relationship affected Rick to become the cold man he was at the beginning of the movie. His development was interesting, and pretty good. The one thing I could say that I didn't like was how everything moved a little too fast for me. Though that in itself is great, a perfectly re-watchable movie. Casablanca had a wonderful setting, a well selected cast and I still can't get over the perfect lighting.",Casablanca

Rick, a tough and seemingly cold American ex pat is reunited with the love of his life Ilsa when she walks into his Cafe, years after she left him waiting for her at the train station in Paris. When Rick comes into possession of two letters of transit the two plan to leave Casablanca together but he instead chooses to make sure Ilsa is safe away from Casablanca and gives her away to her husband.I'm sad to say that Casablanca was not exactly what I expected. Even with a little background information on what was taking place during the film, it was still rather difficult to follow with what seemed like lots of characters thrown into the mix. The flow of the film seemed a bit inconsistent; slow for long periods with small bursts of important information. Being referred to as one of the most romantic screen plays of all time, I was a bit let down to see little romance and was little there was, lacked in true on screen chemistry.Although my first impression of the film was not the best, I believe it is one that deserves to be a watched a few more times in order to understand and follow it better.",Casablanca

This is the story of a man who started out as a relatively happy person as an American living in Paris. He then, like in most movies, finds a pretty girl whom he comes to adore. But her secret past ends up coming into play and he finds himself alone on the train station leaving France to Morocco. Now, years later, he owns a bar and seems very stand-off-ish and more somber than when he was at France.

622,JimDenney,Casablanca,9,13 May 2015,"Casablanca is a 1942 romantic drama directed by Michael Curtiz, but the strength of the film is that classification does not entirely do it justice. The story could also be called a war movie, even though there isn't any traditional war action and has a film noir feel at times.The film stars Humphrey Bogart as Rick and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa. There is some terrific dialog and many famous lines, such as when Rick toasts Ilsa saying ""Here's looking at you, kid"". Delivered perfectly of course.The cinematography is excellent, and I thought the filming of the scenes inside the bar were very impressive. The lighting was very interesting, with some film noir style lighting at times. Bergman was often filmed with a very gauzy look, but it was subtle, in fact it was beautiful, but it didn't distract from the film. The music is perfection, and is the acting.I need to see this again as I am sure I missed a lot as the story is a little complex and there is a lot going on on screen.",Casablanca

The film has elements of action, suspense, and is a comedic goldmine with plenty of iconic quotes and memorable scenes. All of the acting was excellent in this movie with special recognition going to Humphrey Bogart as Rick and Claude Rains as Captain Renault, who both made up the two most dynamic characters in the film and really made it a winner. In addition to the excellent characters and cast, the story was also very interesting and dynamic, and the ending was a pleasant surprise.",Casablanca

For people who are more emotionally attached to the events of WWII, I am sure this film provides much more enjoyment.It feels like it drags on too long. It has a lot of scenes that just feel to me like filler, as they don't contribute in any truly meaningful way. The action, especially the shooting, felt stiff and unnatural. Also the way that the officer calls for backup, but then helps Rick after all seems contrived to just show some conflict at the end. He changed his mind for no apparent reason.",Casablanca

Humphrey Bogart is obviously a great actor, but this movie almost put me to sleep! Every character in the movie either has a cigarette sticking out of his mouth or a silly accent.

Casablanca (1942), is based on the American play ""Everybody Comes to Rick's"" by Murray Burnett and Joan Allison.Casablanca remains one of Hollywood's greatest moments, receiving a perfect 100 Metascore rating, and a professional reviewed Tomatometer score of 99% score from Rotten Tomatoes. Casablanca won the Academy Award for Best Picture, and Curtiz was selected as Best Director, for the efforts of this film.The movie is about World War Two, and the main character, Rick Blaine's personal confliction with whether to enter the war or not. Rick starts off as isolationist, likely a symbol for America at the time in 1941, but that the movie decides that as the world is changing around him America needs to step in. Everyone's personal life is on hold while the war goes on, everyone is unsure where the world will go. For once the love story in the movie does not take center stage, instead it's used as a symbol of what Rick would like, but chooses not to have. This, ironically, create one of the most iconic love stories in film history.",Casablanca
628,ctcpolo,Casablanca Review,10,10 March 2021,"Casablanca had the perfect mix of romance, action, and drama to bring it all together to make a truly entertaining movie. The set design from the very first scene, is very foreign, but beautiful, with potted plants on windowsills, and busy streets with cab cars, and people walking about. One of my favourite parts of the movie, was the music. Much of the music early in the movie was not from the score, but from a character playing the piano, the songs that he plays play a small but important role in the plot, and I liked how they incorporated little things like that. Overall I really liked it, and it is one of my favourite movies I have watched from that time period.",Casablanca
629,k-boughton,From Selfish to Selfless.,7,31 March 2021,"Casablanca is an incredible film, the lighting, script, acting everything together just made this movie a classic like no other. What stood out the most to me was the use of music in this film. Sams voice of course was a highlight for me, his performances set this film above others in this time. Especially the use of the song ""as time goes by"" the song is so prominent in the film and there are so many different emotions that accompany it throughout the film. The song showed the evolution of Sam and Ilsa's relationship, there were the moments were the song was filled with anger and what was lost and the moments of them in love and finding each other again. With the movie being so fast pace there are a lot of moments that can be missed or misunderstood but the feelings the actors portrayed when ""as time goes by"" played made the feelings in those moments easy to comprehend. Also Rick of course was a stand out character and evolved greatly throughout the film. Rick was one person to Ilsa and one person to everyone else who knew him at the Cafe. After Rick lost Ilsa he became selfish and full of anger, but as the film went on he stripped away his hard exterior and ultimately gave up everything he ever wanted so Ilsa could have the life he knew she deserved. Ricks selflessness at the end of the film showed just how strong his love for Ilsa was, he chose her happiness over his.",Casablanca
630,paleowildchild,Best movie I've seen from this era,10,9 March 2021,"Casablanca was an excellent movie. The cinematography in the film was far ahead of its time. It felt very natural as if I were watching it play out in real life, which I believe was partly due to the script. Everything in the film was perfect, down to the costumes.As for character development, it was excellent! The flashbacks added a lot to the development of the two main characters but left enough wholes in the story to keep the audience guessing.At first, the plot was constantly changing; at first, you think the plot is about the people trying to get out of Casablanca, then the relationship between Rik and Ilsa, and finally, the missing papers. The plot for this film was far ahead of its time.",Casablanca
631,griffinsnyder,Almost Perfect,6,21 March 2021,"I enjoyed the first half of this movie far more than the second. Rick's lack of empathy to anyone but himself is entirely justifiable. He had been betrayed by the woman he loved. And upon finding out the truth as to why only made it more understandable. And upon her returning into his life by chance, she again used him to get what she wanted; her and her husband's safety. You can see how much pain he is in when Rick finds out the truth. He is a complete mess, drinking ungodly amounts and weeping/wallowing in his bar. She did not deserve redemption, even if it were for a higher cause. It was selfish and it truly broke Rick.It is also clear that this movie is a representation of America in World War II. Like Rick, America did not want to be involved and wanted to remain an isolated nation. But, through circumstances they had no control over, they were left with two options; either allow these powers who seek total obedience to trample over them, or to fight back. And seeing as doing nothing would cause more death, there truly was no other alternative.",Casablanca
632,AlexCWM,Classic for a Reason,10,24 March 2021,"Casablanca was a movie ahead of its time in many ways. The innovations not only in story telling and filmmaking but also in social commentary are breathtaking. The makers of Casablanca employ many camera techniques that really opened the door for modern film and set the stage in ways we hadn't seen before. In addition, the film portrays a nice element of diversity and takes on the war from a critical lens. Through the character of Rick Blaine, the movies criticizes the mindset of America and tells an enthralling story that is bigger than it appears. Casablanca is a masterpiece film.",Casablanca
633,le_chiffre-1,Am I missing something?,1,6 February 2010,"So I finally got around to watching Casablanca, one of the greatest movies ever made, or so I've always heard. Does it live up to its hype? In a word, no. It was maudlin and melodramatic; Ingrid Bergman was homely, no matter how many softening effects were used in the close-ups of her face (did a rodent gnaw off the sides of her nose? To say nothing of that masculine jawbone and those underdeveloped lips...); Humphrey Bogart was about as slick and charismatic as the Hunchback of Notre-Dame; and the story was undisguised war propaganda. One would have to have the mental age of 5 to think this movie was in any way great. Watchable, yes, but not great, and certainly not deserving of being on the IMDb top 250.The movie was fast-paced, which was both good and bad: good because it would've been unbearable to watch otherwise, and bad because it didn't give the viewer time to get attached to any of the characters (which is just as well, since as I've said, it was war propaganda and so the less effective, the better).Apart from a few good one-liners and patches of clever dialog, the only other positive thing I can say about it is that it was technically well made, in particular the lighting and the dynamic camera work (though I'm not personally a fan of this style of camera work, as I find it detracts from story and atmosphere). It was, however, irritating how the lighting would change whenever there was a close-up on somebody's face. What was the purpose of this? To try to mesmerize the viewer? Talk about corny.If you've never seen Casablanca before, don't feel you have to, because you ain't missing much, ""kid."" It's about as overrated as it gets.1 out of 10 stars, to offset the deranged ""I'm giving it 10 stars but I wish I could give it more"" reviews this cinematic mediocrity has been getting.",Casablanca
634,lllinggg,Overwhelming Perfection,7,9 January 2004,"The widespread popular reverence for Casablanca is rooted not in innovation, but rather in perfection. One would be hard-pressed to discern anything particularly radical about the film's primary components. Though captivating in their own way, the story, the characters and the direction are modest and unassuming. Yet it is a modesty tightly wrapped in excellence and precision. Simply put, this is as good as conventional cinematic storytelling ever gets. During the height of World War II, Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is the impervious American owner of a Casablancan nightclub, serving as the epicenter of social unease in what is still unoccupied France. The unexpected arrival of Czechoslovakian resistance organizer Viktor Lazslo (Paul Henreid) and his dazzling wife Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) forces Rick to revisit his painful past and take sides in a war he had previously tried to ignore.The alluring, cosmopolitan backdrop of colonial North Africa compliments a remarkable cast of three-dimensional characters, who exhaust and renew their humanity amidst war's cataclysmic turmoil. Negative elements, including the unfortunate absence of native characters, as well as the demeaning treatment of the nightclub's black entertainer (Dooley Wilson, condescendingly referred to as ""the boy"" despite his advanced age), are not strong enough to withstand the overwhelming intensity of a truly exceptional film. Seven stars out of ten.",Casablanca
635,tinyredspoons,Refresing take on an old theme,8,25 March 2011,"Casablanca is a refreshing deviation from the usual romantic drivel that Hollywood now produces. This is probably because more than anything it was a propaganda piece urging America to enter the war. This is most apparent in the last scene when Humphrey Bogart tells the ""love of his life,"" that them being together is unimportant in the grand scheme of things, that there are much more important forces at work. Tha they must embrace the cause they believe in, and go their separate ways. Quite a different approach when looking at films now, where feelings and love are all encompassing and one's duty in the face of adversity should take back seat to falling in love.",Casablanca

The acting is superb with Bogart playing a very cool, but wounded Rick. Also, Claude Rains as Capt. Renault was often very funny and gave the the film a lighthearted feel in between the more serious moments.The director, Michael Curtiz did an excellent job creating a very subtle, oppressed feel to the characters on screen with the constant spotlight which can be felt in many of the scenes. Also, there was great use in lighting to foreshadow the intentions of many of the characters.All around Casablanca has a great story, funny/touching moments and a definitive style.

I never found myself bored, not even for a second. The underlying dry humor in a lot of the scenes really made the storyline comical to the viewer (if you understood the humor). I have a whole new appreciation for old time movies and Humphrey Bogart. The dialog was perfect, the characters sucked you in so much that at times I forgot it was just a movie. I also may have been the only person who was thoroughly happy with the unusual ending that in my eyes wasn't predictable. That's the most I can say without giving it away. It had an array of comical and lovable characters that I couldn't help finding myself wishing that they'd have a happy ending. Especially Sam, the piano player, although he barely said two words throughout the film his charisma and cheerfulness in an otherwise very depressed time made him so lovable as a character. Rick Blaine was a strong character that you couldn't help feeling some sympathy for, but his character displayed selfless and humble qualities that made the movie all the better.",Casablanca

639,Natybug97,Certain Expectations,8,8 April 2014,"After hearing so much about Casablanca and about how great of a film it was for it's day, I have finally been able to watch it. For a long time it has been on my Movies To Watch list but I've just never had the opportunity or just never got around to it until now, and honestly though it was a good movie, I guess I was expecting more. When you hear about how great a movie is, you have high expectations and you expect those to be met, sadly, this film didn't meet those expectations. The film is a well shot film and the lighting is remarkable how it singles out characters or makes their face look just so, but the story is not necessarily what I expected. I fully expected a sappy romantic movie that you couldn't help but like because the characters were so genuinely in love. Definitely not a man who owns a saloon and is secretly pinning away for a girl that left him at a train station who then pops back into his life very much unannounced and undesired, especially because she is with another man. The story itself is not all bad, don't get me wrong, just not what I was expecting. Though the hero did not end like I would have wanted him to because of his selflessness, he does have a happy ending to a certain degree, and he certainly isn't all that alone in the end. Despite my expectations for the film, it is a rather good film and I would probably watch it again.",Casablanca

It's about loving and losing, rising above and sacrificing for the greater good, and becoming a better person. At the time of its release, people everywhere were reeling from the injustice that's captured in the film, which fueled its advancement. All films renouncing Nazi terrorism tend to be highly respected, but this one is especially so. The music, both diegetic and nondiegetic, is beautiful and touching. The lighting is soft and fitting, and all of the characters who should be are rounded out well. Ingrid Bergman is unbelievably gorgeous, which makes it a little hard to concentrate on the witty, fast-paced dialogue she's involved in, but it's worth it. Humphrey Bogart portrays his supposedly cynical lead character perfectly. There are so many factors that make this the classic it is, and I don't think I could put my finger on all of them.Overall, ""Casablanca"" is exactly what you would expect a film this reputable to be: beautiful and inspirational.",Casablanca
641,theocharous_an,A timeless classic,8,1 March 2017,"Yes, I've finally watched Casablanca and I felt like I reached another milestone. Saying that the film is famous is just an understatement. Casablanca is undoubtedly one of the most loved, influential and timeless pictures in the history of cinema. Yes, even 75 years later, this classic continues to mesmerize the audiences with its captivating story and compelling characters.Filmed and set during WWII, Casablanca focuses on Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), an American expatriate who owns a club in the city of Casablanca, then in French Morocco. He is introduced as a powerful, rich and cynical man who only cares about his own good. Everything changes though when Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) walks into his club. Rick's past, as well as his well-hidden emotional nature, start to unfold and the events that follow lead him to a great dilemma.Do you know anyone, at least half-interested in cinema who has never heard of Casablanca? Probably not. Now, there is reason why a film so old is still famous today and frequently appears in ""top 10 films of all time"" lists. So what distinguishes Casablanca from its contemporaries? I would say its story. The characters seem to have been taken out of an ancient Greek tragedy as they find themselves caught between love, duty and honour. The plot and pace are excellent, especially the way the timeline unfolds raising questions and then revealing the answers one at a time while the action is building and the climax is drawing closer. A love triangle or a love story with sad (or even bittersweet) ending wasn't something you saw much in films back then. Casablanca was bold, affecting and included characters much more realistic and relatable than the conventional of Hollywood's golden age.Of course one could by no means ignore the superb acting. Humphrey Bogart is outstanding as the overwhelming Rick Blaine, indifferent on the outside, but a romantic sentimentalist on the other. Ingrid Bergman also shines in what is probably her most famous performance. She did a remarkably good job considering that she was still learning English. The supporting cast is solid, nothing less expected from actors like Paul Henreid, Claude Rains and Peter Lorre. The surprising fact is that nobody had any great expectations about the film. The story is an adaptation of a not so successful play, the production was rushed and used limited budget due to the war and both Bogart and Bergman tried to get out of the film at some point. Well, they couldn't be more wrong. Surprisingly, everything worked perfectly for Casablanca and the result continues to inspire actors and film makers to this day.More reviews on https://reflectingoncinemablog.wordpress.com/",Casablanca

The actors were great, you really could get into the plot as they shaped their characters. The sound effects were very good when it came to the airplanes and gun shots. The dialogue was loud enough to understand what they were saying which is a plus in this time period. The love story really sucked you into their relationship and past and makes you feel the hardships of corruption and economic struggles. The lighting was absolutely excellent. It really made the scenes bright and happy but could get really serious and dark with great face contouring and shadows.

The movie was somewhat predictable, but well done and also an interesting concept and I liked the underlying meaning.Humphrey Bogart is very polished in this movie and I thought Ingrid Bergman was superb as well.

I'm not even sure why particularly, as technically there isn't really anything special about it, and if it weren't for a Red Dwarf episode- ""Camille"" I probably wouldn't have been interested in watching it. Nevertheless, there's something enduring about it that means no matter how many times you watch it, you're still not sure what the characters really want to do, Rick, Ilsa, and Renault are all 'real' characters, with choices that one wouldn't know how to make.

I'll admit that I think it's a very good film with some very good performances and the romantic chemistry created by Bergman and Bogart is awesome, but being a massive Bergman Fan I've so far got 20 of her films and I wouldn't include Casablanca in her top 10. (Casablanca is in my opinion not as good as Gaslight, Notorious, Arch of Triumph, Under Capricorn, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, The Inn of the Sixth Happiness, Goodbye Again, Indiscreet, Joan of Arc, Voyage to Italy, Cactus Flower, Anastasia).  There are some great moments like when Bergman tells Sam `play it, Sam' then Bogart walks in.  The Paris flash back. The Le Marseillaise bit and of course the ending.

Casablanca is a different kind of love story, more likely to infect rather than effect.She almost makes me believe it every time. When she says, ""You're very kind."" Bergman was more than just beautiful. And with Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt and Peter Lorre, cinema magic was created. But to me, Bogart was the greatest actor of all time. It's hard for me to believe he died almost 50 years ago. Every time I watch his films, it's like they were made yesterday. And that's why he is timeless. I'm still trying to figure him out.""I should never have switched from scotch to martinis."" Is said to be Bogart's last words. A legend, indeed.",Casablanca
650,mmcintyre813,A CLASSIC!!,10,17 March 2021,"This movie is one of my favorites. I saw it for the first time in high school, and have seen it numerous times since then. It has a variety of different genres depicted in it such as drama, action, and comedy. There's a romantic triangle that got messy for sure. The very last scene was my favorite as the two main characters walk off together hand-in-hand. That scene showed power and success as the world around them was such a mess. During these times refugees were seeking freedom, but it wasn't so easy. The juicy drama between characters keeps any viewer tuned in. Some of the jokes are hilarious and so spot on with the timeline of the movie. Absolutely loved it 10/10 rating.",Casablanca
651,aleksandraryan,No other compares,10,5 March 2021,"What a great film, it is and forever will be one fo the greatest classic films. I have seen this film numerous times and it never gets old. The film set is done so well, it really transports you to Casablanca. The cinematography really is phenomenal. The scene where Rick is getting drunk at the club after its closed, waiting for Ilsa to show up while Sam urges him to go home was shot so well. You see the search light beam pass him and the way the shadows play on his face and the entire room really makes you feel how miserable Rick is at that moment. My favorite scene was at the end when Ilsa and Victor get away and Rick shoots Heinrich. You expect Louis to arrest him, but he lets him get away and even plans his escape. the famous quote "" Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" comes from that scene.",Casablanca
652,Fleapit,One Night of Love? The unanswered questions. !! SPOILER !!,10,27 December 2002,"!! SPOILER !! Without doubt a work of genius. Full marks, 10 out of 10. When this film appeared in 1942 Bogart was yet the great Star he was to become. During the 30s he had regularly featured in Warner Bros. gangster films as a typical hoodlum; all churned out on the WB assembly line with little of interest in them. His reputation at the time was on a par with that of the dependable B-movie actor Lloyd Nolan, perhaps even lower. However, recently he had been cast in The Maltese Falcon where he had displayed a previously unknown potential; Casablanca, in retrospect, transformed his career for him. It also enhanced that of Ingrid Bergman. Others on this website have said much in praise of this film which screams out for its missing sequel (did Hollywood fear a flop so they shied away from it?) a prequel would not come amiss either. So many things are unexplained in the story that there is ample material for further development. Was it coincidence that the man who showed Laszlo the Cross of Lorraine ring, Berger, and Ilsa were both Norwegian? Why does Laszlo, the great underground leader want to go to America at a time, 1941, when all external resistance movements are centred in London? Signor Ferrari is a very mysterious character, is there something more to him than just a clever black marketeer and owner of the Blue Parrot bar? What really took place between Ilsa and her lost lover Richard on that last night together? What happened to Ilsa and Laszlo after they left for America? Did she and Richard ever meet again? Why was the attitude of Laszlo towards her so cold? What was the powerful force that tore the recently reunited lovers apart when they could easily have stayed together? As for a prequel, there are the untold stories of Ilsa and Laszlo, Ilsa and Richard (briefly related in the film) and Laszlo himself.Here is how I see the story continuing. After Ilsa and Laszlo depart on the plane, Berger goes to Ferrari who turns out to be a British agent and the contact man for all agents operating from London in the region. Berger identifies himself as a Norwegian resistance member sent out from London and requests help in getting back urgently. He gives Ferrari a brief coded message for radioing to London. Ferrari promptly sends this off and routinely adds the information that Ilsa and Laszlo are en route for Lisbon. He also requests that Rick and Captain Louis Renault, who have gone into hiding, should accompany Berger as they are in mortal danger from the Nazis who are seeking revenge for the killing of Major Strasser. The next night a small boat takes the three men out to sea where they rendezvous with a Royal Navy warship which carries them safely to England.After arriving in Lisbon, Ilsa and Laszlo go to the American embassy to get the required travel documents and are whisked into the office of the ambassador who tells them that he has been urgently informed by the American ambassador in London that Laszlo has been requested to fly to London by the next plane to participate in a top secret high level conference of senior resistance leaders. However when the couple reach the Norwegian resistance HQ in London, Ilsa promptly denounces Laszlo as a Nazi plant who has infiltrated the upper echelons of underground movements throughout Europe; he holds the rank of colonel in the SS. She learns from Berger that Richard is in England serving in General deGaulle's Free French Army; so the lovers are brought together again. The beautiful, alluring Ilsa is, in reality, a member of the Norwegian secret service who had been deployed as a honey trap to bait Laszlo when suspicions first arose about him following the Nazi take over of Czechoslovakia. Ilsa entered into her sham marriage with Laszlo in England before the war in order to get evidence of his duplicity and, later, his links to the Norwegian traitor, Quisling. Ilsa had explained all this to Richard on their last night together. The two promised each other that they would marry but first she had to complete her work on exposing Laszlo. Richard was sworn to secrecy. Afterwards when the waiter, Carl, escorted Ilsa back from Rick's place she had given him a note in Norwegian to be delivered at once to her compatriot, Berger, instructing him to inform London that she had all the evidence against Laszlo. This was the coded message that he sent via Ferrari. Berger's mission all along had been to ensure the safety of Ilsa.It takes a few months in England before Ilsa's marriage can be annulled on the grounds that it was not consummated due to the impotence of Laszlo (this explains the puzzling brother and sister like relationship between the two in the film). She and Richard married shortly thereafter with Louis as best man. A few weeks later she gives birth to Richard's son, conceived on that last night of passion at Rick's place.Laszlo, still a Czech citizen, was imprisoned under the notorious British regulation 18b as an undesirable alien. His true reason for wanting to get to America had been to set up an underground sabotage ring to undermine American aid to Britain. Major Strasser's secret assignment had been to ensure that Laszlo ""escaped"" to America and to prevent his cover as an underground leader from being blown. In doing this he willingly sacrificed his own life by deliberately aiming wide at Rick so allowing Rick to fire the fatal shot. Postscript: after the war Rick opened a bar in the sleazy Soho district of London, laconically calling it ""Bar of the American Patriot"".Sam's piano playing was performed by Elliot Carpenter http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0139325/bio.",Casablanca
653,rickhavoc1,Why I think Casablanca is better than Citizen Kane,10,3 September 2007,"I know everyone won't agree with me, but I think Casablanca is the better movie for the following reasons.1. Better cast. Humphrey Bogart vs. Orson Welles? No contest. Ingrid Bergman vs. any of the actresses in CK? Again, no contest. The same goes for the rest.2. Better, tighter plot and pacing. The plot and pacing of Casablanca is totally superior. You have to pay attention through the entire movie or you will miss crucial dialog or plot developments. Citizen Kane's plot moves at a snail's pace by comparison, and it's non-linear, which makes it more confusing. Plus, Casablanca tells a better story.3. Better romance. Who even talks about the romance in Citizen Kane? 4. Greater truths explored. While the truths explored in Citizen Kane are important, (limits of wealth and power, the dangers of one man gaining too much power), Casablanca explores more and greater truths, such as freedom being worth any sacrifice, that no matter how many people tyrants kill there are always others who will step up to replace them, how America was seen as the last hope for freedom by those trying to escape from or being oppressed by Nazi tyranny, the critical importance of fidelity in marriage, (which CK barely touched on), and how totally cynical men like Rick and Captain Renault could become patriots, just to name a few.5. Better musical score. Although both scores were nominated for Academy Awards, I really think the score for Casablanca was far more memorable.6. Many more memorable lines. Do I really have to go into this? I don't think so. Besides, plenty of others have already posted comments here about the many memorable lines in Casablanca. 7. More Academy Awards. 3 for Casablanca vs. 1 for Citizen Kane.8. Better final scene. I just think seeing Rick and Captain Renault walking off together with the line, ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" beats the scene of ""Rosebud"" being burned up all hollow. Plus, it touches on another truth, the importance of friendship.9. Casablanca, as well as some of Hollywood's other greatest movies, was made following what I call the ""Indiana Jones Method"". They made it up as they went. Although it can be tough on the actors, this often results in a better movie.10. Casablanca is both timely and timeless at the same time. The same could be said of Citizen Kane, but I think a fictionalized account of the life of William R. Hearst, (which is what everyone, including Hearst himself, thinks or thought CK is) grows LESS relevant as time passes. The timeless themes of Casablanca, lost love, resisting tyranny, patriotism, and freedom being worth any sacrifice will NEVER lose their relevance. Which is why it's so much more than just a WWII propaganda piece.Although I have to admit a slight bias because the main character of Casablanca and I happen to share the same first name, I think I've shown enough other reasons why I prefer it. I honestly believe that the only reason the AFI rates Citizen Kane #1 is because of the many ground breaking techniques Orson Welles used to make it. As for me, I just think that, since the primary purpose of any movie is to tell a story, and use the story to explore and expound on truths that never change, story should trump technique every time. Movies that forget this almost never do well, and are usually soon forgotten. Citizen Kane barely broke even, but it shouldn't be forgotten. I just don't think it's the better movie.",Casablanca

It ranks in the top 10 of most famous critics lists of the greatest movies of all time. Humphrey Bogart gives a stellar performance about a man in love who must chose between two life changing things.I saw this movie when I was younger and watching it again made me realize how much I missed and how powerful the film was. When I watched it the first time I didn't understand much about the war and didn't know what the Vichy French were. The music in the film is incredible, it was way beyond its time and reminds me of music from movies today. Anyone who is a fan of movies needs to give this movie a chance, it defiantly wasn't what I expected. I expected a boring love story set somewhere I didn't ever hear of but it wasn't that at all.

655,kylebristol12,A Little Something for Everyone,10,11 March 2013,"At one point or another, every film lover has heard someone utter one of the many infamous quotes from ""Casablanca"". Lines like ""Here's looking at you, kid"", or ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"", have entered American culture and become part of the language. The reason the film is so popular, even among modern audiences, is because of how personal the subject matter was to audiences - and the cast, too - at the time the film was released. It truly is a film for everyone. The cast features Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in the leading roles, and is supported by an array of incredible character actors including Claude Rains, Peter Lorre, Paul Henreid, and Dooley Wilson. These actors don't just put on a spectacle for the viewer to watch; they create an organic, multi-faceted, and culturally diverse community. Rick's nightclub is home to this community where secrets are kept hidden – or discovered – and people are forced to decide where there loyalties lie. ""Casablanca"" deserves a point all its own on the timeline of American film history. It's romance and it's drama; it is an uplifting comedy and a geopolitical thriller. No matter how you describe it, it is a piece of history.",Casablanca

As the movie went on I started to get lost and confused and couldn't really follow what was going on. I would defiantly want to watch the movie again because I think I would get more out of it. What I could follow was the love triangle that was going on, I thought that was interesting how Ilsa was running back and forth between then men. I thought the setting of the restaurant ""Casablanca"" was really pretty and I felt like I would want to go to that place. It had a really elegant feel to it with a little upbeat twist.

I thought it was interesting watching the transformation from a self centered man to someone that really stuck their neck out for someone. The lighting in the film was very believable. You would think there were no additional stage lights because it looked very natural. The lighting always put the main focus on the characters.

The dark lighting and heavy shadows add a dramatic feel, while the use of close-ups help focus the viewers attention and get a better understanding of the thought and feeling behind the story. My only problem with the film was that at times it seemed a bit hard to follow. If the situation hadn't been explained to me beforehand, I might have been completely lost.

659,sushifish55,So that's why everyone loves this movie!,10,11 May 2011,"Until recently I've never seen ""Casablanca""(1942). The only thing I could tell you about it was that Humphrey Bogart was in it and there was a scene on a foggy airfield somewhere. Other than that I just thought it was some good classic film that simply got over hyped like so many others. Within 30 minutes of the movie I could clearly see I was mistaken. The story, acting, and sets were all fantastic but what really won me over was the amazing cinematography work by Arthur Edeson. Especially the scenes shot in ""Rick's Café Américain"". The use of lighting and shadows was fantastic and gave this film a sort of film noir precursor feel. This film knows exactly when to let information go at exactly the right time and when to add a little comic relief when things start to get tense; whither it be the delight wit and charm of Bogart or the antics of Szőke Szakáll. ""Casablanca""(1942) will keep you guessing with whats going to happen with the characters facing many moral dilemmas and you not knowing if their going to take the high or low road. This was one amazing film that lived up to its hype and for that I give it a 10-10",Casablanca
660,kevin_m_sullivan,Classic for a Reason,9,11 May 2012,"Casablanca is truly a fantastic demonstration of cinematic storytelling. Physically speaking, the film is beautifully constructed. The cinematography is consistently fluid and makes great use of both high-key and low-key lighting. The set design is seemingly flawless, as is the acting, particularly the performances delivered by leads Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. Above all else, I think the writing made Casablanca the classic film that it is. There are countless quotable lines, and the film (and specific scenes) has been parodied into oblivion. The editing in Casablanca continues to contribute to the film's soundness. Various techniques employed severely impact the quality of the storytelling, particularly the film's famous flashback. A+ all around.",Casablanca

It was shot with low light however there were so many wonderful shadows and subtle highlights on the actors and walls that gave for a great feel to bring the audience into Rick's. The characters all have such great depth and it makes you wonder how these people all ended up in Casablanca and whether they'll be able to escape the town. It has so many different great themes such as politics, romance and comedy. The chemistry between Rick and Isla is fantastic and believable. The movie has a few twists in it and even though it was a post code movie there are some little things that you get the hint of that might not necessarily appropriate for the code.

Casablanca is so captivating, and while watching it, it is hard to not feel like you are a part of the romantic drama that you are watching. There are so many emotions packed into this film, and there is not one scene in the film that you feel like could be cut out. The chemistry between Bogart and Bergman is undeniable. The two act flawlessly together which really adds to how great it is. I'm still amazed at how well this was made for the lack of technology that was available at this time.

663,temmons-908-283115,one of my favorite films,10,7 May 2014,"Casablanca, as a movie has so many brilliant points to bring up. First off is the cinematography, done by Arthur Edeson, the same man who was behind the brilliant and groundbreaking cinematography of Frankenstein, we can see some similarities in his style from Frankenstein to Casablanca. He took influence from German Expressionist films of the 20s and this influence is definitely well represented with all of the beautiful lighting and shadows and every range in between that he was well in control of. The cast was perfectly picked for these roles, each of them seems very natural in their expressions and reactions. Each of the sets are extremely detailed, and the special effects like the airplane would have been a big deal at the time. Curtiz is a great director and shows off his unique style here as well as in his other films from this era such as Mildred Pierce.",Casablanca
664,Sidster3,Casablanca - I've seen better,7,11 March 2015,"Casablanca was released in 1942 and was directed by Michael Curtiz. Casablanca is known for being one of the best films of all time, but personally I found it very bland. The plot was good in theory, but the emotional connection and feeling was not there. I could not connect to the characters or their story. Rick, the main character was the most interesting out of the characters and I enjoyed watching his relationship with Captain Louis Renault more than any other part of the movie. Their relationship was the most dynamic and interesting part of the film. The cinematography of the film was decent enough. The cinematographer, Arthur Edeson, use of light and dark added to the films fluctuating mood and helped to portray it in an easy manner.",Casablanca
665,dlabarge-33974,Great Film would watch again,9,29 October 2015,"After watching Casablanca (1941) by Michael Curtiz, I thought the film was superb. The acting by Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman is so well done! It may be a little overly dramatic, but it's a drama so I expect it to be that way. I love the part where Humphrey and the French Police officer are watching Ingrid and her husband walk away into the fog on the airport runway. The cinematography is great also. A lot of shots were very unique but the most spectacular thing about this film is the use of it's dramatic lighting. It's used constantly through out the film. 3-Point, Back light, Key light, and Fill light! Always, nearly every shot seemed to have some sort of lighting factor in it. The lighting also persuaded the mood of the film immensely to me. When it was dark it seem mysterious and when it was normal light it just seemed neutral. I didn't find anything in this film to be a bit boring and I was consistently following the story.",Casablanca
666,eroberts-93865,Casablanca,10,19 November 2015,"Nearly every aspect of Casablanca is striking and impressive. From the sound design to the lighting to the performances, the film doesn't even give you time to stop and process the imagery, witticisms, or technical tricks. This is not to say that's a bad thing. Casablanca, as a result, has great rewatch value.That's not to say that the film has too fast a pace, either. It moves a long logically, just packs so much into each scene. It respects its audience and their ability to ""understand,"" or at least think about what they have seen. Personally, this makes a film that much more enjoyable for me. I think its cultural significance and peoples' timeless care for Casablanca speak to that as well.The chiaroscuro in Casablanca is a constant source of awe. The lights and shadows work off each other in ways that are menacing, playful, and even romantic. The tone-setting and story-telling done with the lighting alone could (and probably has) be the subject of a long, thoughtful paper.The performances, too, are so impressive in their subtext. It isn't typical to see such nuanced emotional storytelling layered in with the more blatant acting we're used to seeing. The backstory between Rick (Humphrey Bogart), Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), and Sam (Dooley Wilson), is told (in addition to the flashbacks) in reactions and facial expressions (such as Rick's reaction to the song Sam is asked to play by Ilsa, or the scene where Ilsa confesses her love to Rick after holding him at gunpoint for passports), rather than ham-fisted ""remember when we all met?"" Due to clear high quality work on the part of the entire cast and crew, Casablanca is frankly timeless. It's entertaining and artful, and seems like it will remain relevant for a very long time.",Casablanca

As great as the cinematography and editing is in Citizen Kane, the writing and acting in this film is of another order of magnitude. There is one unforgettable performance after another- Bogart, Bergman, Claude Rains, Paul Henreid, Sidney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Conrad Veidt, Dooley Wilson, S.Z. Sakall.

It was some very famous scenes, and lines, that I have actually heard from people or television shows or movies mimicking Casablanca before I even saw the movie. Such as "" Here's looking at you kid."" And the famous line at the end that Bogart tells Ingrid to get her on the plane. The song ""As Times Goes By,"" became very well known I think because of Casablanca. Casablanca had such a cultural significance because it was filmed during World War II, there were many people who went to Bogart's restaurant for his help to get them out of Casablanca so that they could live, because the Nazi's were starting to invade it. Casablanca was a classic romance in which Ingrid tried to chose between to loves of her life but knows she can not stay in Casablanca or she will do, so Bogart tells her to leave in that famous scene at the end and risks getting killed himself for shooting one of the Nazis.

671,RWiggum,We'll Always Have Casablanca,10,29 March 2004,"Spoilers ahead, but then again, who isn't familiar with Casablanca, even if one hasn't seen it?I've been watching 'Casablanca' over and over again since I bought the Special Edition DVD, and is there any film out there one can watch again and again without ever being tired of it? And does any film appeal to a broader audience? Just everything about it seems to be as close to perfection as it only can be.But what exactly is so special about it? Is it its great genre mix, never equaled by another film? When we think of 'Casablanca' first, we remember it as a romantic film (well, most of us do). But then again, its also a drama involving terror, murder and flight. One can call it a character study, centering on Rick. And there are quite a few moments of comedic delight, just think of the pickpocket (""This place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere!"") or the elderly couple on the last evening before their emigration to the US (""What watch?"").But 'Casablanca' is not only great as a whole, it still stands on top if we break it apart and look at single lines of dialog, scenes or performances alone. Is there any other film which has more quotable dialog than 'Casablanca'? 'Pulp Fiction' is on my mind here, and 'All About Eve' and 'Sunset Blvd.' come close, too, but still I think 'Casablanca' tops everything else. And not only is the dialog great, it's unforgettably delivered, especially by Humphrey Bogart (""I was misinformed."") and Claude Rains (""I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on here""). Many of scenes have become a part of film history; the duel of 'Die Wacht am Rhein' and 'La Marseillaise' is probably one of the greatest scenes ever shot (the only I can think of that would rival it for the #1 spot is Hynkel and the globe from Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator'), and the last scene is probably even familiar to the few people who've never seen 'Casablanca'. Am I the only one who is absolutely convinced that the film wouldn't have become what it is today if Rick and Ilsa would have ended up as the lucky couple?About the performances: So much has been said about the uniqueness of Humphrey Bogart's and Ingrid Bergman's chemistry as Rick and Ilsa, about Claude Rains' terrific turn as Renault, about the scene-stealing performances by Peter Lorre (one of the 10 all-time greatest actors) as Ugarte and Sydney Greenstreet as Ferrari and about Dooley Wilson stopping the show as Sam. I'd love to emphasize here two other performances, one that is not mentioned quite as often and one which is blatantly overlooked: Conrad Veidt as Major Strasser had a really difficult task here, as his character is the only evil one, but still Strasser is not a one-dimensional character, and it took more than 50 years until another actor gave an equally (maybe even more) impressive performance as a Nazi, Ralph Fiennes in 'Schindler's List'. But why no one ever mentions S. K. Sakall, who plays Carl, the jolly waiter at Rick's Café Américain, is beyond me. He has definitely more screen time than Lorre, Greenstreet and Wilson, and probably about as much as Veidt, and he's a joy whenever he's on the screen. I simply love his reaction when the pickpocket (""Vultures everywhere!"") accidentally bumps into him, or the reaction to the ""What watch""-dialog. Or how he says he gave Strasser the best table, ""being a German, he would have taken it anyway"". His performance is simply criminally overlooked.So is there a weakest link in 'Casablanca'? Every film, no matter how close to perfection, has a minor flaw or two, so one can find them in 'Casablanca', too, if one really tries hard. So yes, one might ask how much sense the entire mumbo jumbo about the letters of transit makes. One might point out that Paul Henreid, although his performance is certainly good, doesn't come close to the greatness of any of his co-stars. However, the film is so close to perfection that I'm almost ashamed that I'm so desperately trying to find less-than-perfect elements.So whatever films will come, how many sequels will overflow the screen, and how much junk we will have to sit through, one thing is certain if we're desperate to see a great film: We'll always have Casablanca!",Casablanca

In this movie, Rick Blaine struggles to decide whether or not he should help his former lover, Ilsa Lund, and her fugitive husband, Victor Laszlo, escape French Morocco. During this, Rick gets flashbacks showing him and Ilsa being together before the Nazis take over part of France. Once this happens, Ilsa was supposed to go on the train with Rick to go to Casablanca, but instead, she leaves him to never see him again. When Ilsa and Victor go to Casablanca, they unexpectedly run into Rick which sends him into a drunken spiral since she left Victor long ago and he thought she was gone forever.This movie was very dramatic and it even made me cry a little. I started to tear up towards the end since Rick is telling Ilsa to go even though she wants to stay with him. This movie was very emotional, but it also had a very good ending. This is definitely on the top of my list for movies to recommend to anyone, especially if they like romance, drama, and/or World War II films.",Casablanca
675,AlecYager,an overall great film,8,23 October 2020,"Casablanca was a very enjoyable film to watch. I think one of the factors that really helped this movie was the time period it took place in. It shows the true superpower Germany was and how the country was pushing people out of Europe at almost all expenses. In the film, Rick is a typical selfish bar/saloon owner that ""sticks his neck out for nobody"" until romance gets involved. I really love how a large portion of the middle of the movie is a flashback to how Rick fell in love. It just so happens that the ever so slight chance of the woman he fell in love with would return to his saloon with her husband who is wanted by the Germans and is trying to escape casablanca. Overall this film is a wild ride of emotions and the ending is just about perfect in my opinion.",Casablanca
676,colinpsquires,As Time Goes By......,10,24 October 2020,"Well I was not a fan of that movie Casablanca........said no one (with good taste) ever. I would be lying if I said I didn't have high expectations going into this film. Just about everyone one I know who appreciates a good movie, that has seen Casablanca, has insisted I see Casablanca. I finally did and the love for this film is not wrongful, I too love this movie upon first viewing. There isn't enough I could say about this movie and the internet has done its best to say just about everything. Beautiful story, beautiful acting, beautiful cinematography, and a beautiful song. Humphrey Bogarts performance as Rick Blaine instantly made him one of my favorite characters across all cinema. Rick is the definition of ""Cool"" in Casablanca. Ingrid Bergman simply delivers in the role of Ilsa Lund. Passionate and elegant, she crafted a great character. I enjoyed the part of Captain Louis, played by Claude Rains, a sophisticated yet subtly amusing character. Rains is fantastic, as time goes by I watch myself becoming a bigger and bigger fan of his. Speaking of ""As Time Goes By"", this song captures the feel and emotion of Casablanca, not only the loss of a true love the loss of security. Casablanca allows the audience to feel the passion, heartbreak, paranoia, and pressure of war and its consequences. If you are a history buff you will appreciate the historical ramifications of Casablanca and the glimpse of the indirect impacts of WWII outside of Europe. This film really does live up to its established standards, I wouldn't call it the best film ever made, or my favorite, its just one of the good ones.",Casablanca
677,jcommerford-43129,The Chaos of Love,10,14 October 2020,"This film is one for the ages. It contains all the perfect ingredients for a movie. This plot is mesmerizing the whole way through. It tells the story that always repeats itself, of someone entering your life and giving endless love and affection and positive energy. All of a sudden, they're gone and there is a part of you that dies and never comes back as long as they're away. But sometimes when they come back the tortuyre comes back too, because they might leave again. If they do it once, most likely they will do it again. Sometimes you have to not allow them back in your life for both of your sakes. No one should have to suffer any longer than they already have, that's why you shouldn't repeat history if it didn't work out the first time. No matter how much you love them, you have to let them go sometimes. That is why this movie is so relatable and won derail, its just a story of an average man who loves someone.Other than the wonderful plot, this film has beautiful cinematography with great acting, a perfect combination. I felt that even for it's age, this movie was able to keep my attention fully and I wished there was more. If I were to put myself in Rick's position, I do not think I ciould have just let her leave my life a second time. I understand the love wasn't even right in the first place because she had a husband, but it was so pure and you cannot take that for granted. I am definitely a romantic and it hurt to watch her leave, even though I knew it was better for her that way.",Casablanca

679,AccessCardRequired,Interesting how many 0-to-1 stars this movie has...,10,24 April 2021,"I love Casablanca as it is for me a flawless movie!Then I looked at the one-star reviews. Or better to say, people who really, really hated this film. It's interesting. Lots of reviewers hated the fact that the characters smoked so much. Hello, back then everybody did.Some hated it, because it wasn't shot in color. (haha)I learned, most of the reviewers don't seem to have any attention span whatsoever. They perceived the movie as too long. (102 minutes btw)
Anyways, the film is great, as it basically is about two plots.The ill-fated love between Ilsa and Rick. And the refugee subject matter everybody is in. So what has changed after some 60+ years? Try to watch it, if you haven't seen it. Casablanca is a delight. Fresh. Honest. Exciting.",Casablanca
680,loopydate,It still holds up!,10,16 September 2002,"After the American Film Institute issued its list of the 100 greatest films of all-time, I started making regular trips to my local Hollywood Video to rent groups of three or four of them.  My summer ran out before I could round out the top twenty, but of the handful that I got around to seeing, ""Casablanca"" was my favorite.I'm currently enrolled in a Gangster Films class, where we screen and discuss classic films in the gangster genre.  Having seen films like the original ""Scarface,"" ""The Public Enemy,"" and others, it amazes me that, while these films are great, they feel extremely dated.The dialogue is clearly circa 1930, and the sets are all clearly just that, sets.But then, you see ""Casablanca.""  While the film is now 60 years old, it still holds up to modern cinema in every way.  The characters are believable and sympathetic.  Rick's unrequited love is painful (emotionally, not because it's awful, because it's not) to watch, not because Bogart is a great actor (though he is.  One of the best), but because it's written in such a way that all of us who have ever pined for ""the one who got away"" know exactly how he feels.I'll spare you a summary, because by now, you know the story.  You know the dialogue, you know the shots.  ""Casablanca"" is one of the most important films ever.  It is almost perfect.It is my sincere hope that the handful of people who gave this film a 1 out of 10 had mistaken 1 as being the highest mark available, because I'd hate to thank that anyone could possibly dislike this film.",Casablanca
681,chrisj893,A Truly Iconic Film,9,20 October 2009,"Casablanca (1942) is a great film that uncovers the pain and hardship that individuals had to deal with while living in a world that was at war. Humphrey Bogart's character, Rick Blaine, acts as the self-tortured protagonist, someone who ""doesn't stick his neck out for no one"". His character is powerfully dynamic and gripping, one cannot predict his actions. The casting and character writing are quite superb, everyone complements each other and Rick and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) create a powerful, passionate foil. The direction and lighting of the film are also very complementary to the great final product. Throughout the film there seems to be two different color and light schemes. The flashbacks offer bright and pretty light to go along with the uplifting flashback storyline. Once back in the bar the lighting is dark and ominous, giving the watcher the idea that something is not right in Casablanca. Casablanca has become an iconic film for numerous reasons, but one reason stands out. This film is about the struggle in a worn torn country and the struggle with ones past. To put it simply this film is real. There are very few false ideas and false feelings. Only films like this can stand the test of time.",Casablanca
682,jejohnson2244,"A Really Great Movie, However",8,24 October 2010,"I wouldn't say it was the best film ever made because it isn't. On the contrary though, it is a classic film that anyone would love and it is to me the grandfather of clichés. First off saying someone doesn't have a soul is clearly cold in my opinion because maybe they are literary, don't watch movies or just didn't understand it and they don't need to be penalized for it. It's an old film noir with really great dialog and amazing acting ( ahead of it's time) and it brings in what most cinema's have today, the art of clichés. First of all the main character Rick is a prime example of a tough guy, not buff, but he proves muscles don't make the man. Then you have Ilsa, the love of Rick's life and she bring the acting game up well. Now Ilsa is married to a guy named Victor Laszlo, and things get very complicated as the German police start to threaten throwing him in an isolation camp and you just have to see it for yourself. It starts with the atmosphere as the Warner theme plays and the map of Casablanca fades in, which loads of films used a lot later and gives that it is an action adventure romance. Next is the dialog, which strongly is by far the best I've heard in a movie to date which adds both mystery, romance, drama and most important humor which is kind of lacked in movies today. To continue we have the battle of the instruments (used in comedies), the mild bar fight which looked incredibly stunning for 1943( though it only lasted about 40 seconds) and finally a signature in westerns, the who shoots first duel at the very end which was fast paced but timed and played out very well. All in all a great film and as Rick said "" This looks like the beginning of a beautiful friendship"". It's worth it.",Casablanca
683,otuswerd,Another timeless classic???,5,27 October 2009,"...what does that mean? A timeless classic. I am told that there are many of them out there in the world of film, and of course, this is all based upon opinion. I saw Casablanca many years ago before seeing the many films I have today, and it was OK. It made me think of Indiana Jones if he settled down and ran a club, but only because the film is based during the same era. Now that I have recently watched it again after multiple viewings of..let's say...Fanny and Alexanrda, Citizen Kane, The 400 Blows, Beauty and the Beast (1946), and even Gone With the Wind, I still don't get why this film is ranked higher than these other films by people.Don't get me wrong, I'm not a hater of it, but I just think it's a bore, and that is my opinion. Humphrey Bogart has never really done anything for me, not even with the countless viewings of The African Queen I had to sit through every time they had it on TV while growing up. I feel that because of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman being in it automatically gives people the right to dub it a ""timeless classic"". When I think of a what that means, ""timeless classic"", I think of the re-play value that the film has. Of course the acting is good, and the cinematographry is wonderful, it's the mood and tone of the film that brings me down.So if you have not seen this, please do have a watch. You might fall in love with it and you might not. I'm sure I will see it again someday down the road, and maybe my attitude on it will have changed.",Casablanca
684,imahottieandahalf,simply great,9,29 April 2004,"Casablanca, the `All-American' film.  Here is the story of two accidental lovers, a classic story line of any movie.  Thinking of a love story you think simple sappy love, yet Casablanca is no where near simple, nor sappy. 	Being made in 1942, this film isn't your everyday movie with sex, alcohol and more sex.  It actually contains a thing called (GASP!) dialogue to reveal how a character is feeling or to explain a situation. And yes, this does get quite long at times, causing any viewer to become quite confused and on the verge of sleeping.  Taking this into consideration, a younger viewer would not appreciate this movie as much as an older viewer would. 	Getting used to the ambiance of the movie is the hardest part.  After that, you may find yourself at the edge of your seat wanting to know more and more of what happened to this couple, Rick and Ilsa.  Rick, a `tough, New York American,' isn't the type of guy that would come off as sympathetic or capable of love.  Yet, as the movie progresses, you realize that he was once a lot happier and certain events have hardened his heart.  Ilsa happened to come into his life at the wrong time, causing her to choose between Rick and, we later find out, her husband.  The movie goes on and, once again, in Casablanca, Rick and Ilsa are reunited. 	Other than just a love story, people don't really realize that this was also about the political issues going on in 1942, causing people to be able to relate more to the movie then than anyone would be able to now. 	Being loved for the past 62 years, this movie is an amazing classic.  A great movie for anyone to enjoy and love.  I would give this a 9/10 because it is simply great.",Casablanca

In a picture encompassing an enticing, romantic love story, a gorgeous setting, memorable characters, strong acting performances, famous quotes, beautiful sets, and incredible photography...what more can I say that hasn't already been said?Well...WITH that said, Casablanca is easily one of my favorite films of all time. I constantly find myself asking people if they've seen the film, and always encourage them to do so if they haven't.I find that Casablanca, though a romantic drama film, never features a dull moment and the amazing cinematography makes this movie just a pleasure to watch. This film could arguably be THE best film of all time. This film will remain a timeless movie forever. Its cliché to say, but they really don't make 'em like this anymore.",Casablanca

In terms of acting character and plot the movie is just superb, the best performance being, obviously, from Humphrey Bogart. Technically, the movie is one of the best that I've seen from that period of time. The camera is EXTREMELY mobile, especially in Rick's Café, moving between the tables and sweeping the expanse of the dining room. The sweeps of the streets were incredible, and the shots seemed to be getting longer, which was nice to see. The most notable thing, technically, was the sweep of the airport as Ilsa and Laszlo's plane takes off. Overall an amazing movie, something I would definitely recommend both for the storyline and for the technical elements.",Casablanca

It broke no rules, nor made it any new rules. What I find unique and brilliant about Casablanca is that no one can take credit for this movie. Casablanca has no great ""auteur"". It's the product of the Warner Bros assembly line of the Forties. Yet, it's the perfect film where everything works and nothing disappoints. Because everyone involved was doing their job. Everything just clicked and that's why the film keeps working with multiple viewings. So stop trying to explain the greatness of Casablanca. It just is.",Casablanca
688,joem294,Casablanca- the Patriotic story,9,14 April 2014,"One of the greatest films of the 40's and one of the best American films of all times. This film gives you the view of WWII no body else can. From the little city in Morroco the story of Rick the bartender gives you the best story of life outside the U.S during the early years of WWII. I'm talking about WWII, but once you start watching this film you wouldn't be so sure if it really is about a war, a relationship, or fight within a war. This film can't be put in as just one genre because there is just so much different events happening nobody could put just one genre on this film.This classic film gives the viewers everything you can want in a film. The film is mainly filmed at night meaning there is a need for lighting that is practically done perfect for every scene. The acting shows great chemistry between the main couple that really only has chemistry in flashbacks. The photography is done so well for dark scenes and even give you scenes from France that make you feel like your in France while the war is only miles away you feel like your there. This film was done as an A film and I agree that it is and found no problems with the editing or any other part of the film.This film was intended to be a patriotic film, but today people who haven't seen would not know just by knowing the name of the film. This film takes the audience to the safe areas of the war and shows them how everyone in the film is affected by the war. The famous scene done with the two anthems being sung at the same time was done to predict the outcome of the war. In Ricks bar the German soldiers begin singing their anthem, but Rick gets Victor a man that was from France began to sing the French anthem and got the entire bar to sing along and got the band to get even louder, in which overpower the few German soldiers. As the film continues the German soldiers around the bar become more aggressive and show Rick that even though he is neutral they aren't afraid to stop him, but when Rick allowed Victor to sing the anthem really showed that Rick had picked a side and was going by it.This film was put out in theaters before the war ended and became a very Patriotic film for just Americans and anyone else supporting it. This film was seen as a normal film to the creators but the viewers saw the film as one of a kind and really was in a way propaganda against the Germans in WWII.",Casablanca

But I didn't believe that this couple actually loved each other, or whatever it is they felt for each other. I realize that the reason that this movie seems so basic to me is because all other movies with this kind of plot have built upon this one, but usually being more fleshed out is a good thing. My mother, both my grandmothers, and my one great grandmother all expected me to cry watching this movie, but the tears didn't even threaten to spill over. I did enjoy this movie though, a lot.

I definitely recommend watching this movie 2ne1 that enjoys a good action and suspense movie more on the suspense side then action side but definitely a worthwhile movie to sit down and watch with you're better have a group of friends or even yourself.. phenomenally made movie would love to watch it again sometime...,Casablanca
691,JJC-3,This will not be a commentary on how great Casablanca is!,10,23 June 2005,"Because anyone with even a small thinking brain will realize that Casablanca is one of the all time greats. This diatribe is directed at those CHILDREN who would try to compare todays movies (?) to Casablanca as well at the actors.To MARKS16 from London England: There was no plot to hold the viewers attention. Are you an idiot or what. There were several sub plots and the main plot which was Lazlo's needing to escape to America to evade the Nazi's and continue his resistance work. How could you miss that unless you were too busy with you game boy or your computer to notice.To MAITREG from Minnesota: Anything this silly would be laughed out of the theater and to video in a week. Maybe for you brainless moronic children who can't sit through 15 seconds of a movie unless there is an explosion or a sex scene.TO FLAVIA DIETRICH from Brazil: Bogie unattractive???? you must be blind. And nothing is convincing???? Open up your eyes and ears and watch it again!!!To SELFPARODY from the USA: It was not a story about WW2, it was a story about people in a time of crisis, and how they handled themselves during that crisis. You are a real dolt!!To AVALEN1: ??????????????????? What are you babbling about. 60 plus years later and this flop of a movie is still finding new audiences. Will your childish 2 fast 2 furious be finding new audiences in 60 years??To PLSJ from the USA: Next time you watch this movie you should turn off your IPod and your Game Boy and your computer and watch it with 100% of your attention.To JAMES P. McDONALD of California: If you do not feel any emotion when you watch this film then you must not have any. I feel sorry for you.To ALEX-506 from Toronto: Any capable actor could have communicated Rick's cynicism???? Who??? Tommy Hanks??? NO! Tommy Cruise??? NO!! Vin Diesel??? NO!!!! A-Hnold???? NO!!!! Oh wait there is ONE who could BOGART himself!To THEFAN from Detroit: And what cinematic classic do YOU fawn over?? Animal House??? Star Wars???? 2 fast 2 furious???? You are an idiot for sure!To PAUL ARTHUR from London: Casablanca not serious, you need to go back to watching Benny Hill then!!!!To BETTY BULLOCK from AUTRALIA????? Fight Club??? American Beauty???? Mulholland Drive???? WRETCH!!!!!! 3 garbage pail movies. ANY movie that requires a nude scene to rope you in is no great at all!!!!! Anyone can strip naked to get the guys and the lezzos into the theater.To SPUD-48 from Idaho: The reason for the ""No Questions"" was to protect Ilsa from the Nazi's since if they knew she had a relationship with Lazlo they would try to use her to get to him!! Do you now understand??? Rick does not hide the letters while the spotlight is on him, he waits until it is moved and then slips them under the lid of the piano. The Nazi's can not arrest Lazlo in Morocco because they have no authority to do so. Only Capt. Renault can make that arrest, and he is content in knowing that Lazlo and Isla will never get out of Casablanca, and only does a reversal of sorts when Rick tricks them all into thinking HE will be going to Lisbon with Ilsa and leave Lazlo to rot in Casablanca. Renault basically switches sides when he lets Ilsa and Lazlo board the plane. That choice is cemented when he tells his deputies to ""round up the usual suspects"" after Rick shoots Strasser!This is as far as I will go in this diatribe. I am sure the remaining 50 pages of commentary have more childish remarks like the ones I have taken to task above. They are all idiots too!",Casablanca

It's just that beautiful so you never get bored of seeing. I can't say any other thing. Oh, the best scene? My favorite is the one where Rick tells Ilsa all the pain he suffered for years and then kisses her in the dark. It just inspires me so damn much.

694,djestic03,A contender for 'the perfect movie' category,10,15 November 2017,"What other reviewers overlook is the rapid fire and multi-layered dialogue that just crackles through the first third of the movie as the elements of the plot are established. Almost every 'casual' conversation, brief meeting, or soirée involves hidden meanings or jockeying for position (or information) that I find brilliant, and yet, we are IN on it! What more could you ask of a movie? There are enough plot challenges and twists that keep outcomes totally unpredictable. The characters are well developed, act credibly, and there are no outrageous plot twists to rig the outcome. Acting is absolutely first rate by all the main players, with the exception of Paul Henried, whose stiff, mostly reserved personna works in his favor when he leads the legendary and emotional 'anthem competition' scene. The dialogue seems just MADE for Bogart's cynical, world weary delivery...and his facial expressions are a delight to behold. Bergman is electrifying. Rains should have won an award as the opportunistic, slick, Prefect. Intrigue is EVERYWHERE in this movie, and the minimalist lighting, the heavy shadows, the bars and bar-shadows make this an example of a wholly developed, carefully presented, craftily written movie worthy of top consideration as THE best Hollywood can offer.",Casablanca

Everyone else had shiny face like they forgot to put make-up on them. the lighting seemed to be coming from every where which I liked it gave it a really cool comfortable feel and the shadows made feel like it had more depth to it.

698,Sowerplave,A great movie of its time that has aged very well - 8/10,8,12 February 2021,"This review comes from a first-time watcher.For being an almost 80 year old movie, the story and the way it's driven through the acting along with the dialogue managed to come off pretty fresh. This movie wastes no time with establishing the stage on which they are set on, the characters and their personalities. The huge amount of dialogues and lines in this movie is what sets free the potential in this movie.I saw another reviewer referring to a particular scene as ""The Battle of the Anthems"". That particular scene left a lasting impression on me and was a great summary of the mood and the time that this movie is a product of.There is a lot of dialogue, and a lot of it is fast-paced. This is primarily where I saw the heart and spirit of this movie come from.As much as I enjoyed this movie, and as much as I now understand why this movie is considered an all-time classic, I don't think that this is a movie for everyone.A great movie of its time that has aged very well.

I wonder why nobody's opened one in real life? Maybe they have, I will have to look that up. Anyway, the movie was great, cheesy in some parts (where they should be I guess), but great. It had big presence actors, evil to fight, a good looking woman, great atmosphere/sets, and unlikely twists. Shadows and lighting were masterfully done, especially with hat shadows across the face, and the sparkling of jewelry and eyes. I was also a big fan of the police chief who added a down to earth humor to the situation. Ooh, and I also learned why ""bogarting"" something meant being selfish.",Casablanca
700,ericglunneborg,This movie proves how hurtful a love triangle is,9,27 April 2004,"Casablanca is one of the most popular films ever made. The movie takes place in French Morocco just before the start of World War II.  This is a place filled with rich Europeans who wanted to escape the war,  crooked officials, and criminals who are trying to profit from the war.  The movie starts with the murder of a  German courier who had been ambushed in the desert.. He was carrying two transit visas. These were extremely valuable travel documents, that meant free passage to Lisbon, and from there to America and freedom. An American night club owner, Rick Blaine, is stopped  by a passport dealer who has the transit visas. He asks Rick to keep them for him for a few hours. Rick agrees and hides the documents in a piano. Rick Blaine, an  American who owns and operates the nightclub/casino is the main character. The part is  played by Humphrey Bogart. Rick has not taken sides in the fight for control by the French resistance and the  Nazi officials. Bogart plays the part in his usual calm, collected self until his lost love from the past walks back in to his life. She is not alone, but is with the most wanted man in the resistance. They have come to Rick's place to hide out from the Nazis. When the two see each other, memories of  their time together come flooding back. Ilsa  Lund, played by Ingrid Bergman, needs Rick's help. Rick is the only link to obtaining the necessary exit visas for her and her husband ,Czech freedom fighter Victor Laszlo , played by Paul Heinreid,  to get out of Casablanca safely. The German-controlled local government, headed by Captain Louis Renault (Claude Rains), is moving in, and Laszlo has to move fast to get his visa. It is a classic love triangle: Ilsa  is still in love with Rick but feels compelled to support her husband, while Rick controls the future  of the man who is married to the woman he loves. This is very disturbing for Rick. After all, Ilsa was the one to walk out on him when they were in Paris.  Bogart plays the part of a tough guy who hides his hurt behind a shield of cynicism. Ilsa's arrival in Casablanca rips through in this shield. One scene that sums it all shows Rick,  drinking alone in his bar, wondering why of all the places in town, she had to walk into his. Other supporting cast members are: Conrad Veidt as the Nazi commander on Laszlo's trail, Peter Lorre the black marketer who sells the letters  of transit,  and Sydney Greenstreet who is the head of the citys black market.When you watch this movie, you can almost see the conflict on the actors faces. The truth is that they themselves did not know until the final day of filing who Ilsa would choose, he husband or her former lover. By playing whole movie without knowing how it would end, the scenes became more convincing because the actors themselves were in in the dark about the ending of the movie.Casablanca is a classic movie that has something for everyone. It is filled with romance, intrigue, mystery, and suspense.  This film deserves five gold stars.",Casablanca
701,greggs_nbacon,Simply Timeless,10,4 June 2013,"Casablanca is a film that never loses one bit of any emotion or wit that it was originally written with. This classic tale of romance contains the timeless theme of the nearly hopeless struggle of getting over that one ex that still captivates you, even though you ended poorly. Bogart gives the performance of a lifetime as Richard Blaine. There's a real sense of bitterness and dismay that no other actor could come close to capturing. Ingrid Bergman becomes one of the most beautiful creatures to ever grace the screen as the breathtaking Ilsa Lund. you can really see her heart breaking throughout the movie in the way her eyes move as she tries to pick between her husband, Victor Lazlo (Paul Henreid who gives a great performance as the well respected war hero), and her former lover, who now has become a crotchety old drunk. Claude Raines steals every scene he is in, and offers some of the snappiest dialogue ever seen in film. This is by far one of the greatest films ever made.",Casablanca
702,fredanddeanfan,Excellent! One of the best!,10,14 March 2012,"Romance. Drama. Humphrey Bogart. 3 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Put them together and what do you get? Warner Brothers' ""Casablanca"". Set in Casablanca during WWII, this film tells the story of Rick Blaine (Bogart), a bar owner bitter after an abruptly-ended romance with the lovely Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman). Rick's doing okay, that is until Ilsa walks back into his bar and his life, bringing her husband (Paul Henreid) with her. Add into the cast great talents like Claude Rains, Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet and how can you lose?Arguably the best movie of all time, ""Casablanca"" is well-worth viewing.

703,SuperDuperMCA,Classic Americana,8,23 April 2013,"Casablanca was a fantastic romance film but I feel as if people put it on a pedestal it doesn't deserve. Sure, the acting is terrific, the story relates to many people, and Michael Curtiz did a legendary job directing but what exactly made this movie the timeless classic it has become? I did enjoy the lighting in many scenes because it makes the viewer focus more on the charters facial expressions and body language, especially the scene in which Rick is alone drinking at the bar and Sam comes down to check on him it was also clever how the cigarette smoke blurs the screen and goes into Rick's flash back. The composition of the film is really what I enjoyed, everything is crafted so beautifully. The plot is great but just not for me I guess and if it wasn't for each scene being so artistically graceful I would have definitely lost concentration on the story. Definitely a master piece of 1942 that will never be forgotten but I would not agree with most that Casablanca is ""the greatest film of all time"". Give it a watch though if for some reason you were living under rock like me, guaranteed any viewer will find something they enjoy about the film.",Casablanca
704,JFHunt,"""I should never have switched from scotch to martinis.""",10,6 December 2006,"The Petrified Forest convinced the world Bogart was a bad guy. And for years he shocked and awed the audience with roles fitting that image. The Maltese Falcon showed a new kind hero, one with an edge. Bogart, with all the right things to say and seemingly never losing his cool. Then came Casablanca and the ages. The man's  man comes with a heart. Arguably, three of his best pictures. All showing a change in a man's character and the depths of what acting is supposed to be. Maybe it was Warner Bros all along. Maybe Bogart was simply Bogart.What can I say about this film that hasn't been said in over 60 years since its release. Is it a great film? Yes. Is it a showcase for Bogart? If not, than what else. Was Bogart the coolest guy to ever live? Absolutely. Casablanca is a different kind of love story, more likely to infect rather than effect.She almost makes me believe it every time. When she says, ""You're very kind."" Bergman was more than just beautiful. And with Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt and Peter Lorre, cinema magic was created. But to me, Bogart was the greatest actor of all time. It's hard for me to believe he died almost 50 years ago. Every time I watch his films, it's like they were made yesterday. And that's why he is timeless. I'm still trying to figure him out.""I should never have switched from scotch to martinis."" Is said to be Bogart's last words. A legend, indeed.",Casablanca
705,Chris042711,Good movie,7,22 April 2014,"Having often heard this title thrown around for years it does live up to its hype. This takes place in the south of France during WWII. The main character is an American who has chosen to start up a club in the city of Casablanca. Humphrey Bogart plays Rich, the American as he is split between choosing the love of his life or saving her and her husband who is a resistance fighter against the Nazi's. The movie was a little controversial because it was released to the general public after the attack on Pearl Harbor and after we entered the war against the axis powers; but before we knew that we were going to win the war.This is reflected in the movie and shows our hopefulness as by the end of the film Rich chooses to step up and fight against the Nazi's as he once did before opening his club.I believe this was a reflection of the WWII era as his actions reflect the action the USA took during the years prior to Pearl Harbor. What I mean by this is during the early years we would sell guns and supply the allied powers with aid but when the war came to our doorstep we stepped up and did what was right. I think movie goers at the time really enjoyed this movie for that reason. Overall I would have to say this was a very good film for the earlier 1940's era of film making. The use of light in the film was done brilliantly as an almost precursor to the Film Noir genera which would come later in that decade. By this I mean the use of light to set the mood of the scene as either a dark gloomy feel with very little light and the use of shadows to open shots with much light to show a lighter more comical side of Rich.",Casablanca
706,skosatka-54154,Vastly overrated,1,24 April 2019,"Anyone with an open mind/opinion will agree that this is a horribly overrated film. Period. I am 62 and have seen this film countless times and, frankly, I just don't get all the praise-especially as a ""romantic film"". There is little chemistry between the two leads and ""story"" merely gets in the way of the rest of the film. Sorry, folks, but anyone can pick more romantic movies-""Sleepless in Seattle"", ""Random Harvest"", ""To Have and Have Not"", ""The Best Years of Our Lives"", ""Marty"", etc. Heck, there is more chemistry between Hepburn and Bogart in ""The African Queen"" than here. Of course, I suspect that people who think ""Casablanca@ is a great romantic film probably think Katherine Hepburn was a ""great actress"". She was great at playing variations on the same character. I like Hepburn, but ""great""? Nope.",Casablanca

708,bsilvey,It Took Me a While to Come Around to This One,8,18 August 2003,"Ah, ""Casablanca.""  Is there a line from the film that hasn't become a cliche?  That's not a criticism of the movie.  If anything it's the reverse. What greater compliment to a film screenplay can a film audience make than so completely absorbing every word of it into its common cultural consciousness?It took me a long time and multiple viewings before I warmed up to Michael Curtiz's 1943 film (by some accounts a 1942 release).  I'm not particularly a fan of either Ingrid Bergman or Humphrey Bogart, and the filmmaking techniques didn't strike me as anything inventive or unique and they still don't.  At best, ""Casablanca"" exists as an example of the classic Hollywood style of filmmaking working at its slickest and most polished.But then on about the fourth viewing, it struck me.  The people who love this movie don't love it for the striking visuals or the daring narrative or any of the elements that make, say, ""Citizen Kane"" such continual fuel for film discussion.  People still love ""Casablanca"" for coming out at exactly the right moment in our cultural history, and somehow it's retained that ""right place, right time"" allure.  America had been involved in World War II for at least two years by the time of this film's wide release, and many women had seen their men leave to face uncertain futures.  So no wonder a film with such an intense nostalgic glow about it would strike a universal chord.  No wonder the forbidden romance between the Bergman and Bogart characters seemed so instensely poignant.  And no wonder the patriotic, ""do whatever you must for the good of the cause"" propaganda (for let's call it what it is), seemed so stirring (and still does).Is ""Casablanca"" a great film?  I won't attempt to answer that, though it's not one of my personal favorites.  But any film that carries its legacy with it the way this one does can't be completely dismissed either.My grade: B+",Casablanca

710,pietoso,Here's Humphrey!,10,24 October 2020,"Reviewing Casablanca runs the risk of many unpleasantries, for instance: to say again what has been said ad infinitum, to be swept up in sweet, simpering praise, and so on. At minimum I'll probably manage the two mentioned. Casablanca really has it all as films go, from masterful, iconic performances by film legends to some of the best writing ever committed to a page of script. It seems to invite hyperbole, perhaps because it's so effective when it comes to eliciting an emotional response from the viewer. The romance between Bogart's Rick and Bergman's Ilsa hits all the right notes as far as drama goes. Melodramatic but tastefully so, measuredly bitter when called for, it has an incredible ability to court excess without falling into it. Besides the two mentioned above, who do surely deserve all the praise they have ever received for their performances, the remainder of the cast is somehow nearly as excellent. In particular the unbelievably debonair Claude Rains constantly shines, and Dooley Wilson's Sam delivers at least one of the most memorable scenes in cinema with inimitable style and tenderness. However, the real star of the picture might just be the screenplay, highly effective at counterbalancing tension and romance even as it generously leaves us with a few certifiable gems for the Film Quote Hall of Fame. These elements, along with the sets, the lighting, and every other factor collectively make up some of the most potent shots I can recall: Les Marseilles in a raucous café, Bogart and Bergman locking eyes luminescent across a shadowy room, fog choking a dimly lit airfield as a great romance concludes. Casablanca may not be a perfect film, or the greatest, but it has all the qualities of a candidate at the very least.",Casablanca
711,mckennaniedhammer,A Good Watch,8,31 March 2021,"I must admit, I had to watch this a couple times to fully understand and follow the movie. It definitely gets confusing with all of the characters, but after the second or third time I started to see how great of a movie it really is and how much it stands apart from other movies during it's time period. Casablanca tells multiple stories depending on how you look at it. It tells the tale of a love story, that gets a little crazy, a political story about the war and what effects it has on peoples lives, and also shows the changes the characters go through personally, like with Ricks opinion on war. It definitely is overlooked by many because it is often misunderstood, but I definitely would recommend giving it a watch!",Casablanca
712,alc01,The best there ever will be.,10,1 October 2002,"Look up the word ""classic"" in the dictionary and Casablanca it there.  It is as perfect as a movie gets.  The writing, the pauses, the looks, the love, the humor - all in perfect time.  The shadows, the music even the background actors and noise blend to make each scene seem real.

It may be cliched and rely on narrative coincidences (guess who wrote a film studies essay on this film), but when all the elements combine, who cares?

I thought despite all of the politics and revolt, that this was a beautiful story of love, and struggle. The relationships between all of the characters was amazing, the way they all just seemed to belong together in this time and place, in these situations. though all of the characters work to pull the wool over each others eyes and keep out of view of the Germans, in the end one large scheme pulls everyone together and allows everyone to end up where they belong. Through Ricks many connections in Casablanca he is able to run a money making business that also acts as a safe house for exchange of things not so legal at this time, and brings him a part of his past he would of much rather lived without ever remembering again...Ilsa. In the end nothing is really what it seems...",Casablanca
716,Blondeatheart56,A movie that could pick up the pace,7,29 April 2004,"`Casablanca' is a very well known movie by people of all ages.   A lot of whom enjoy the movie quite a bit and some who maybe don't enjoy it as much. This reviewer liked the movie for the most part.  It has an interesting plot, but one that mainly people of an older age would understand.  It has romance (and that's always a good thing) and it may even teach it's viewers a little something about history that they might not already know.  One of the only problems with the movie is that it's slow moving.  It's a lot of talk and no action.  Movies don't have to be all about blowing things up and killing people to be good, but `Casablanca' involved maybe a little bit too much talking, at least at one time.  At one point in the movie one of the main characters was talking for so long that this reviewer found herself starting to drift off.  Movies should grab the audience's attention and keep it.  `Casablanca' is a good movie, just one that could maybe be improved a little by picking up its pace.All of the acting was very good.  Most of it was rather believable and didn't come across as too cheesy.  At the times when an actor/actress was supposed to be making a really long speech, they did so very well with a lot of the right emotion needed to convey what they were saying.  Rick, played by Humphrey Bogart, is supposed to be a bad boy who deep down inside has a heart.  Bogart did a very good job of portraying this.  Throughout the film Rick just seems to be cool and self-confident.  It's like he's what every boy wants to be, especially since the ladies like him.  All of the acting done in `Casablanca' only helped to make the movie what it is today, a timeless classic.A big portion of the film is set in Rick's American Café, which is just about the only American thing in Casablanca.  Because of this almost all of the music is a piano playing in the background or someone singing.  There is music that has been added in, but a lot of it is music coming straight from something in the movie.  The whole idea of doing that gives the viewer more of a feel like they're there with the people on screen and not just watching them.  It should be used in more movies these days.`Casablanca' came out in the 40's and, of course, the special effects back then weren't as good as they are now.  There was one scene in particular where the movie was really lacking in this area.  Ilsa, played by Ingrid Berdmen, and Rick (Bogart) are driving in a car together only they're not really driving.  There is a fake background behind them and it seems like they're just jumping up and down in their seats and smiling.  This whole thing is in other old movies too.  It just shows how far Hollywood has come with their special effects.`Casablanca' is a good movie that could be improved a little.  There are a lot of movies out there that this reviewer would love to own and `Casablanca' just isn't one of them.  Yes, it is a classic and a great movie, but it's just not the type of movie that this reviewer enjoys.",Casablanca
717,Jennydavis131,a great classic film,9,28 April 2004,"Love, passion, corruption, lies and murder are only a few things that are contained in Casablanca's story line. Made in 1942 it remains a great film that people still talk about today. Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is a man bitter about love, and doesn't stick his neck out for no one. He lives in the city of Casablanca in Morocco and owns his own American café which is more like a saloon than a good place to sip coffee. A long love Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) revisits Rick unexpectedly and leads to a lengthy flash back to better days in France.As the Germans are trying to take over the world during WWII people flee to Casablanca to try and get to America for a free and safe life. The plot speeds up as a customer of Rick's asks him to hold on to papers that will lead anyone out of Casablanca and into America with no questions asked. When the man gets killed by the corrupt police, Rick is stuck with something he doesn't want and does not know what to do with it.Casablanca is one of the most emotional movies the viewer will ever see, from love and lust to murder and deception you're always on the edge for your seat and wanting to know more.The actors could not have done better. Humphrey Bogart's detached emotion adds a lot of comedy to the film, but when he loosens up sentimentally you can't help but to cheer. Ingrid Bergman is a great actress who can love you one second then pretend to hate you the next. Claude Rains who plays Capt. Louis Renault is a man who gets what he wants when he wants it even if it costs other peoples lives, but some his cold heart unthaws.The dialog in the film is lengthy and somewhat confusing at points, but normal for those classic films that try to be sophisticated.
Casablanca is a film to watch over and over again without it getting old or boring, and can still connect to its audience 60 years later. So here's looking at you kid.",Casablanca
718,samsq22,War-time Romance,7,8 March 2012,"Casablanca cannot be fully appreciated until its audiences realize just how much it relates to history. Being one of this movie's audience members of today robs me of exactly what the feelings of society were when this movie came out. During my cinema history class, we discussed the significance of this film which served great importance. Although the movie had a bit of a dark view to it (well, it was in black and white) and it seemed a bit confusing at times, it was overall a great movie. I must admit, I did get a bit lost and I felt that the storyline tended to be a bit clear. However, this tale of a war-based romance is gripping and intriguing. The main character, Rick, faces huge life hurdlesincluding facing and finding his long lost love. It is a universal theme of abandoned love, with a historical twist of World War II. Overall, this wartime romance and adventure is worth the watch.",Casablanca

I loved how there was many themes within the movie, showing problems that were occurring during WWII along with a love story between Rick and Ilsa. The movies story kept me intrigued throughout the whole movie, I was always interested in what was going to happen next. I thought the scenes in the nightclub gave a nice atmosphere throughout the movie.

The right stars, the right supporting cast, the right director and particularly the right script came together magically for the best movie in Hollywood history.I often say that this movie is like Stairway to Heaven - it has been ripped off so many times, that to watch it now for the first time can make it seem full of cliches - as long as you were aware that it was this creation that started all the cliches.Briefly, the plot concerns the coming together of half-a-dozen main players in Casablanca during the middle of the second World War. Humphrey Bogart is the archetypical softie with the hard, cynical shell, Paul Heinreid is a wonderfully noble leader of men, Ingrid Bergman truly makes you believe that a man could obsess about her for years.  Claude Rains is wonderfully devillish as the corrupt prefect of police, Sidney Greenstreet positively Machiavellian as a business rival and Peter Lorre incredible as a cheap hood.Watch this movie, and for the love of all that's holy, make sure it is in the original black and white!",Casablanca

My mother constantly urges me to see it (she is a huge Humphrey Bogart fanatic). Rick Blaine's character is interesting. Rick is a cynic. He is very sharp and commonly snaps back with a witty one-liner. The cinematography in ""Casablanca"" is interesting. Ingrid Bergman plays Ilsa Lund. Ingrid is commonly shot from her left side. The Turner Classic Movie channel referred to her left said as her ""good side."" Shadows are used nicely in this film. The scene with Humphrey and Claude Rains (Captain Renault) utilized this. Bars of shadow often cover the faces of the actors to perhaps to insinuate imprisonment. The film also shows an interesting interpretation of pre-World War II. Casablanca is a basically neutral area at the time. People from all over the world end up in Rick's gin joint.

The script also probably the best one ever writen. It was just so well told and many very famous lines came from it. Definetly one of the most memorible films ever made, especialy to me. Casablanca makes history in both Hollywood and in my mind by becoming the greatest movie ever in film history. And you don't know how hard it is to make a movie that becomes my favorite .10/10. Loiey, this may be the mark of a wonderful movie.",Casablanca
731,rivardoman,Casablanca is a well written romantic drama,8,7 May 2014,"Casablanca is a film that goes much deeper than suspected. The world history behind the story is fascinating! Humphrey Bogart does a great job, he captures the surprise along with the resentment upon meeting his past lover played by Ingrid Bergman. The films themes are very patriotic and romantic. The tension between the waring parties makes for great scenes like the battle of the national anthems between the German soldiers and the French people living in Casablanca. The photography is dark and brooding. The lamps within the club cast fantastic shadows across the walls. Casablanca is a romantic classic that stands the test of time.",Casablanca
732,alex-domberg,Instant Favorite,9,13 March 2013,"I only heard of this movie before watching it, and I heard mixed reviews. The movie deserves to be played over and over again. You just don't see such quality in movies anymore. Movies like Casablance pertain to what was going on in the world at the time. It is one thing to just entertain, but quality entertainment is the best. Casablanca had a great cast and Bogurt absolutely made the movie. He gave Americans a tough guy look back in the 40's when this was released. He had a good sense for what was authentic and what was phooey. He also did a good job portraying what heartbreak is like for men. The way he tricked everyone but in the end saved the say for everyone and made some characters realize what they should represent. Overall, a great movie that deserves all the hype associated with it.",Casablanca
733,the_godfather424,Here's Looking At Casablanca,9,10 November 2004,"Casablanca has an outstanding storyline. Critic Leonard Maltin puts Casablanca as his contender for the best film in Hollywood of all time. The lines are good, everything is fine but its just missing something that I can't really explain. It doesn't matter though. Casablanca is worth looking at because of it period time:during World War II. Humphrey Bogart is like a legend in this film as bar owner Rick Blaine who meets his ex-girlfriend again Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) but she just wants Rick to help her and her boyfriend Victor Laszlo(Paul Heinreid) get out of Casablanca to America so they can be as far away from the nazi's as possible. Claude Raines as a nazi is another glamorous character. Won Best Picture, Director and Screenplay Oscars of 1943. 9.9/10.",Casablanca
734,i-fraher,review,8,23 October 2015,"This movie was really good. The whole look of the film was awesome. The movies shot in black and white and with the lighting in the movie, it gives an awesome looking image. When I first saw this movie i thought it was going to be just a love story and i wasn't to interested but it ended up being way more interesting. The characters i thought were really good as well. The movie stars Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman and was shot in (1942) and is directed by Michael Curtis. Its its 102 minutes long and is rated Pg. I highly recommend this film. Real good movie. The way the film looks is really cool, it doesn't look like other black and white movies either. Its different.",Casablanca
735,jarrettjmayo,A women needs her ex lovers help to escape from Germany,7,9 March 2016,"The movie was shot in black and white and mostly took place in a night club. The lighting made good use of shadows to make it actually look and feel like a crowded, smoky night club. The film's lead (Humphrey Bogart) does an incredible job of playing a kind of mysterious, hard to crack his shell, kind of protagonist. However, I feel the films hype may have lessened the impact of it for me. I liked it and enjoyed myself overall, however, I found myself bored at times as it was mostly the same location. Something about stagnancy of location makes the plot also feel stagnant to me as well. Though, like I said, still an awesome plot and great performances all around.",Casablanca
736,robfwalter,An extraordinary film from start to finish,10,17 February 2018,"What I found most extraordinary about this film is the way it manages to engage right from the start. Within ten minutes, the plot had me enthralled, the characters had me emotionally committed and I was fascinated by the moral questions.How will Viktor Lazlo escape the Nazis? How complete is Rick's moral degradation? Is there any limit to the depravity of the Vichy regime's representative in Morocco? What happened in Paris between Rick and Ilsa? These questions are all addressed simultaneously as the action unfolds with hypnotic acting by both Bogart and Bergman and brilliantly tight plotting.Some of the other actors are not quite up to the standard of the leads, but I think this is the way films were made at the time, with broader acting by minor parts than we usually see in films today.So much of this film is now cliche, but that's because it defined modern Hollywood cinema and thus had a tremendous impact on Western culture. With some essential cultural artefacts, this ubiquity can make them seem a bit tired or over the top, but Casablanca is so perfectly pitched and moves along at such a wonderful pace that it transcends its own transcendence to be what Hollywood has always aspired to - pure entertainment.",Casablanca
737,creekin111,My #10 favorite film of all time,10,12 February 2006,"To see Casablanca's poetry on screen is like witnessing the Sistine Chapel for the first time. Like a fine bottle of perfectly aged wine, its complexities are seemingly endless. It only gets better with time. To quote Bogart in The Maltese Falcon, this truly is the ""stuff that dreams are made of."" Easily the greatest romance ever to be produced on celluloid. Casablanca blends the genres of musicals, drama, romance, war, film noir, suspense, a little comedy, and a touch of mystery so seamlessly it is easy to forget that at its very heart and soul is a romantic picture.It pacing is almost frantic from beginning to end. The use of shadows and lighting are so vivid and fascinating that it is probably the best looking beautiful B&W film ever made. The most memorable lines in movie history and the most amount of memorable lines in movie history.I don't expect people who dislike romances to like Casablanca. Its dialogue, characters and songs have been so familiar, it hardly even seems as fresh as it should be. But like witnessing the Sistine chapel for the first time, you know what its like. But its another thing to see it completely for yourself.",Casablanca
738,the_barnacle,A comforting and reassuring delight,9,6 October 2019,"Living in chaotic Britain in 2019, on the verge of a great societal transition, Casablanca re-instilled some faith in my bleak outlook on the near-future. It's been enlightening to finally watch this timeless film and realise how many times it is referenced across cinema. I find the audio in Casablanca very consoling because the hubbub of background noises are muffled, so my attention is solely taken in the soundscape of the current scene. And yes that may sound peculiar, but it makes me very relaxed!Looking at the other reviews, there is not much more to add besides the wondrous tingling sensation I felt when the café stands to sing Le Marseillaise to drown out the singing of the German soldiers, and the slightly comic repetition of Signor Ferrari swatting insects at the end of each scene in which he appears.To any people of Generation Z put-off by black and white films (or anyone at all for that matter) give up on the Netflix pulp and spend your time watching awe-inspiring films like this!PS: We'll ALWAYS have Paris.",Casablanca

It seems everyone has a line worth repeating, however Bogey has the best ones. But what about the music?

This film stands head and shoulders above any of the high-budget money making monsters that seem to come out every weekend in modern day cinema.  The plot is so genuine, the characters and their situations are microcosms of situations I've been in, and I relate to them on a very intimate level, and the acting, well, the movie has Humphrey Bogart.  The acting is superb; second to none.  I love this movie, and I truly wish that everyone could enjoy it the same way I do.",Casablanca

It just a movie, yes, but a perfect one!  Even though it's a small little story about something not to important, the actors, the direction, the photography, the editing, and the score is great!  It's why movies are made, to entertain!  It entertains a great deal.  The best film acting in film history by Bogart in this movie.You can't analyze this film and have fun with it like Kubrick films or Citizen Kane but your not supposed to with this one.  I feel it's just a regular movie, but the best one at that!  I think in some scenes the music over powers the screenplay because it's such a small story but it's been rated the second best movie of all time by AFI and critics around the world love it!

743,jhpowhida,Much More Than A War Film,10,19 October 2020,"Casablanca takes place during the second world war and reflects much of the uncertainty and tensions of that time. The setting is a near perfect place for the story to take place. A city full of refugees and soldiers from both sides allows the filmmakers to explore the attitudes of the nations at the time in a way that does not actually show the conflict. American neutrality is shown through Rick, and German warmongering is shown through the many German soldiers. There are, of course, other characters from other nations as well. In addition to this the film has a compelling love story and is endlessly quotable. The ending is one of the most iconic of all time. It is not a happy ending although there is some solace to be had with Rick and Louis' new friendship. There is seemingly an endless amount of praise that can be given to this incredible film.",Casablanca

746,silentium,"""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.""",9,30 July 2003,"Ever since I first saw this film years back, I wondered where all the praise came from. Then I realized -- movies with figures of huge importance are widely regarded as masterpiece material.Citizen Kane has a man of large wealth and power. Casablanca has a widely respected night club owner. The Godfather has mafia kingpin Vito Corleone.Why is it so interesting for us to see men in power? I think it's because subconsciously we connect with the feelings of power - and in a way ride the American dream with these dreamlike images. These movies are true cinema - as it was always intended to be. The acting, the score, the dialog, the staging, etc, etc ... it's all great. As Rick fades into his first flashback with Ilsa and Sam hammers away at the piano we realize that we've now experienced something.
The direction is slow and methodical, as I like for it to be and I honestly believe this is cinematic art -- much different from painting art on a Hollywood palette. This is the kind of movie that will change the way you dream and has one of the widest known film quotes ever: ""Here's looking at you, kid.""The only thing that drags down the score is the over-hyper customers that often annoyed me. This doesn't detract much; but it's still there and I felt it improper when the rest of the flow is so formal.A-: Good film experience with screen legend Humphrey Bogart giving his best performance. Those who are easily annoyed may need to bear with this one, though.",Casablanca
747,HulotderSpeiler,Greatest American Movie Ever,10,23 January 2009,"Hollywood(land) never made a better film, and I strongly believe that they never will. This film started as a flawed small film that the star (Bogart) hated, saying ""the situations are ridiculous."" Adapted from a play that is now little known, the screenplay, courtesy of the Epstien twins and is often regarded as the greatest ever. As well it is peppered with famous scenes, such as the flashback and airport, backed by excellent sets, powerful screenplay with great lines tossed around casually, and stupendous acting from Bogart, Bergman, Greenstreet, and Rains. To say that this is Bogart's strongest performance would be difficult, considering the versatility proved by him in Treasure of the Seiarra Madre, but Bogart was born to play this part, which contains the romantic hero, the sad drunk, the lonesome drifter, and the devil-may-care noir hero. His acting is genius, a stream of forlorn faces, emotionless reactions, excellent deliverance of lines, and confident movements, all of which is outlined in the waving, shimmering distortion of the smoke from his cigarette.To sum it up, the best romance ever, the best American movie ever, the best actor ever delivering his best performance, reading the best screenplay ever, all work together to be one of the most beloved of all movies.",Casablanca
748,j-rodriguez4,The pedestal,7,6 December 2009,Every movie genre has a film or films that set some type of standard. This movie as set several standards across the board. I guess in the romance section this would be apart of that collection.I guess we all go threw stages in our lives where people pop in and out and sometime we are just looking for the right person. Sometimes we need to come back to life as Rick did.Other aspect of the movie I enjoyed were the music and how it set the tone and how you can seem to relate to the other characters in the film because at one point we have all been one of them. I guess a lot of people can see them selfs in the movie and thats why they enjoy it so much.,Casablanca
749,ecamm216,Fast Paced with a Love Story,8,20 October 2010,"This movie had started as a little confusing to me but as it kept going I was able to piece together what exactly was going on. I thought the movie as very fast paced and at times a little too much because I had gotten confused too much it felt. It is most certainly a movie I would enjoy to watch again to pick up the little details I had missed the first time. From what I saw and what I had gathered from this movie, I can see how iconic it really is.With everything that was going on in the movie, there was a nice love story that was just as fast paced as the movie was. The character Rick at first just seemed like a stubborn and not so emotional man but he starts to unravel over the course of the movie. The audience starts to see he is hurt that the love of his life is gone and now back in his life but is conflicted with what to do even though she is married. It is obvious the two still love each other and the tension and bitterness between the two of the them is apparent but, I felt the love story still worked within this.",Casablanca
750,JPTaylor,What more can be said?,9,29 April 2004,"While not a perfect film, Casablanca achieves what few other films have.  It completely immerses the viewer in the era and the atmosphere, offering a journey to the ever distant (yet all too close) world of Casablanca, Morocco during World War II.  It is the hope of thousands (if not millions) of refugees, yet for so many who live there it is a prison - a last, impossibly difficult gate to freedom from the war-torn European countryside.In Casablanca is a night club, Rick's.  It's a self-indulgent gambling, music and drinking joint that's a parody of the American dream in a foreign land.  The piano rings with Sam's melodious delivery of universal themes of love, pain, and cheer.  Below the surface is a circle of intrigue - few tell of their allegiance to the Allied cause, and yet fewer live to spread the word.  Rick Blaine, the owner of the club, walks the fine line of neutrality.Humphrey Bogart, in his portrayal of Rick, is no longer a character but an American icon.  Many of his lines can be quoted, verbatim, by people who have never even seen this film.  His cynical, callous, chain-smoking personality is a mask to hide emotion and protect himself from pain  this is clearly an archetype for countless characters since.  His key philosophy is ""I stick my neck out for nobody.""  Thus, the ultimate struggle of the film is not a frenzied firefight with Nazis or a an elaborate chase scene, but one man's struggle to define himself.Many of the other characters in the film are equally interesting - Casablanca is a film of choices. Ilsa is a French dame who must decide between the man who will never forgive her and the man who needs her more than anyone else.  Victor Lazlo, the leader of an underground resistance movement in Czechoslovakia, must make a choice between his love, and his sense of honor.  Captain Renault is a Vichy officer who must choose between serving the winning side or his own true loyalty.Casablanca is deserving of its near-universal and prolific praise.  It is a film of memorable characters and lines, filled with subtlety and complexity. Once it grips ahold of the viewer, it never lets go.  Aside from a bit of over-acting and some characters somewhat lacking in depth, it is a triumph of cinema.",Casablanca

What made the movie so amazing in my eyes had to be the story, dialogue, and cinematography throughout the film. The story was a relatable one, disenchanted lovers who meet again one day but seemingly cannot be together. The movie is magnificent at showcasing the highly interesting story of Rick, Ilsa, and all the dynamic characters they continue to meet along the way. Every main and supporting character in the movie was interesting and had depth beyond the surface. The story wasn't predictable and it kept me engaged throughout. The dialogue is one of my favorite aspects of Casablanca. Famous quotes such as ""Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the worlds, she walks into mine,"" sum up the characters' feelings, emotions, thoughts, and the type of person they are all through their dialogue. The cinematography is also a key to success for Casablanca. The attention to detail with shadows and soft lights creates beautiful scenes that convey tenderness in characters such as Ilsa or sadness in Rick. The movie, overall, is a piece of art that has and will continue to stand the test of time in cinema, and rightfully so.",Casablanca

It was fairly simple and easy to understand, whatever action sequences no matter how small were good, the filming was great, there was a good balance of light and dark and finally the characters and acting was phenomenal. Everyone was so good although I do think Humphrey was the best. I was surprised at the end of the movie when Rick didn't get the girl and that he didn't act selfish for once and let her go I really thought they were going to end up together but oh well what can you do maybe that's why some people love this movie so much. 8 stars a must see.",Casablanca

It is one of the most prolific, successful, and critically lauded films in American history. It's also one of my personal favourite films. From start to finish, the dialogue is endlessly quotable without becoming obnoxious, and it maintains a keen wit that is unforgettably punched into film canon with Humphrey Bogart's legendary delivery. Bergman is angelically filmed in each scene with extreme attention paid to framing and lighting, and she flawlessly portrays a woman tortured by her situation. The special attention to the lighting, the bustling Rick's café, the unique period of American neutrality before involvement in WWII... The list of things I love about this movie goes on and on.

From the lighting to the timeless quotes I believe every aspect of this movie was done excellently. The two areas besides what the average viewer would notice that I would like to comment on are the lighting and the camera movement. First off the lighting through out the film helped to set every scene and the search light at night especially served as a reminder that despite the night clubs and the open markets Casablanca was not a totally free town. The other technical aspect that set this movie apart was the camera movement. The director managed to always have the cameras in the perfect place and all movements were very smooth.

761,ShanghaichickS,"Love, confusion, and constant battles between whats right, and whats desired.",10,5 May 2004,"Casablanca takes place in the little town of Morocco during WW11. Casablanca is a city that many refugees flee to, in search for a new life and a new world. When first watching this movie, the viewer (especially if the viewer is a female) cannot help but notice the romantic plot, the perfect romance plot at that. However, Director Michael Curtiz, focused on other elements in the movie to add more relevance that the viewer could better understand, and relate to. Though the entire story was fictional, the information that you receive from the plot is 100% true information about how life truly was during the war. The reality of the war really sets in, and it's inevitably that the audience will have compassion on what people went through during this time. 	Not only was the history and received information of this film outstanding, the characters were as well. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are a phenomenal asset to the film. There connection was so intense, that the whole room of viewers only just assumed that they were together. Bogart's stern and strong character keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat only guessing what he will come up with next. His constant battle to do what is right or to do what he wants adds constant guessing to viewers mind.	All in all this film was amazing. Sure the acting was rather exaggerated at moments, and the characters really lacked in their depth at times, but this movie has been viewed and talked about for years, only proving that it is a classic. Man quotes from this movie are being used in people's vocabulary, and they don't even know where the quote came from.

Probably one of the most romantic movies of all time, ""Casablanca"" is an all time classic.""Casablanca"", rated #2 on AFI's top 100 movies of the century, deserves it's eight Oscar nomination and winner of three.  When it was released in 1943 America was fully entering World War II.  While the Nazis were invading France and everyone else trying to move to the Americas, A beautiful film was being depicting a love story of two unfolded on screen.  This movie, with it's ever so famously quotable lines, could have been easy for men and women of that era to relate to.  As Rick had to say goodbye to Elsa, many men and women of that time were saying goodbye to each other, as then men took off for war.  Some may say ""Casablanca"" is too dialogued and not enough action, that was just the point.  Though it may have been set in a time when action was plentiful, this movie was more about dialog and acting.  Just like a great writer, it takes time to understand their writing.  ""Casablanca"" takes more understanding, then the car racing people killing and risque make out scenes of today, but it is well worth the time.Rick (Humphrey Bogart) may come of as a tough never been in love before kind of guy. He hides a much softer side and only one woman can bring out, Elsa. Elsa is played by Ingrid Verdman.  That felt she has married the wrong man. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Verdman act extremely well with one another. Bogart's scene where he remembers his past comes off convincing as he cries his problems into a bottle of alcohol.Although not much action shots are seen among this movie to make it amazing, the story itself comes off interesting.  Taking the time out to understanding ""Casablanca"" may make the film more enjoyable than it seems. This romantic movie set in the time of war comes out to be one of the best or well known movies of all time.  Whether you've seen it or not, you've probably heard of it.

There is nothing in this movie that this reviewer doesn't like. One of the most highly used story lines is in this movie, the lost lovers. A perfect romance spoiled for some reason.  This was the story in Casablanca.  Rick, played by Humphrey Bogart, and Isla, played by Ingrid Bergman are these two characters.  They could not have picked a better duo for this movie.  The chemistry between Bogart, and Bergman was fantastic. Because they worked so well together, it made the story very realistic.This movie also includes the `tough guy.'  Bogart's character, Rick, is the ultimate example of this.  The best way to describe him is using one of his quotes from the movie, he sticks his head out for nobody.  He also never drinks with his customers, which shows his detachment from others.Last, but not least, this movie's star is Humphrey Bogart.  This man is Americana.  He is looked upon by many Americans as `the epitome of cool.' Although he is not an incredibly attractive man, his presence makes many people love him.This review gives this movie a 9/10.

Especially when dealing with moving camera angles. Very appropriate lighting, for example, in the scene at the end it is dark and gives you a mysterious feel to the whole ordeal that occurs between the men.

It tells a story so wonderfully. There is wit, humor, intrigue, politics, great characters, fine acting, a beautiful woman, and fine editing. It is a story of hope and good will.It makes one want to be a part of the time period and the setting. It is a very intelligent film using tactful techniques to reveal character traits. And best yet, it has a difficult to guess ending.It is clean entertainment and you forget that it is in black and white because the story and characters and one song are so wonderful.I was skeptical about watching this film at first, held on to it for 6 months before actually watching it, and I'm glad I got the film because it's now a favorite.",Casablanca
767,chris-glo,Bergman & Bogart - a Fantastic Pair!,10,4 April 2005,"I have always adored Ingrid Bergman. This woman could say more with her eyes than any other actress ever filmed. I have seen just about every single Ingrid Bergman film and have never been disappointed. And Bogie? There never has been or ever will be another like him. His performances will always stand out, no matter how many years pass. Another outstanding performance in this film is by Paul Henreid, who plays Victor Lazlo, an underground hero and bane to the Nazis. There is a part in this film that always overwhelms me. At Rick's place, the Nazi soldiers have all gathered and start singing their ""National Anthem"" much to the chagrin of the rest of the customers, who are mostly French. France has already fallen and is occupied by the Germans, so these people are very downhearted at hearing this Anthem being sung. At that point, Lazlo (Henreid) walks over to the band and demands that they play ""La Marseillaise"", and they do, causing everyone to stand and sing, showing their allegiance to France. The German singers are then drowned out by the French. It is overwhelming and is like a look into the future of the war and Hitler's ultimate defeat. If you want to see a war film, without the blood and guts, but with fine, intelligent and outstanding performances, look no further than ""CASABLANCA"".",Casablanca
768,christygoodman1,"Here's lookin' at you, Casablanca",9,31 October 2005,"In the middle of World War II emerges a small ""waiting room"" called Casablanca in French Morocco. In the depths of this small town reigns the most popular night spot in Casablanca known as ""Rick's Café Americain."" And let me tell you, this is the place to be. Everybody comes to Rick's.Our famous hot spot is run by Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), exiled American and freedom fighter. Normal will cease to exist after Rick comes about two letters of transit. All of a sudden, Czech Underground leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) arrives in Casablancawith Rick's old love Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman). Past memories arise causing love, friction, and much more.Noted director Michael Curtiz, 56, took over the direction of this filmand did a magnificent job if you ask me! Also having directed films such as The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), Daughters Courageous (1939), and The Sea Hawk (1940), Casablanca still acts as my favorite of his collection.Many exciting technological features have been shown in this movie. There are shadow effects that bring out many points of the motion picture. A neat fading transition sought out my attention.The acting in this film was excellent. Humphrey Bogart, also starring in The Maltese Falcon (1941) and High Sierra (1941), portrayed his character extremely well. Co-starring Ingrid Bergman, who clinched stardom in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1941) and Adam Had Four Sons (1941). Together, these two made the show on the big screen. I was compelled by the chemistry between the two.All in all, this movie was right in the right areas. It was a tremendous love story with drama mixed into it all. It is a great date movie and I would give it 5 stars! ""Here's lookin' at you, Casablanca!"" *****",Casablanca
769,bigcahs93,An American staple that stands as a timeless classic,9,2 May 2013,"Casablanca is a 1942 romantic drama directed by Michael Curtiz, staring Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund. In the realm of American films, Casablanca is as well regarded as Gandhi or Einstein, and for good reason. You can make the argument about the films political messages regarding the time period, but nothing overall hinders the movie, in my opinion. Like most other movies of the time, the cinematography is excellent, not very exciting but well made none the less. Curtiz also uses dark lighting in an excellent way, in fact one could make the argument that this film is total film noir because of Curtiz's obsession with shadows. Otherwise, in terms of content, nothing else about the movie really stands out, with maybe the exception of the mini airfield they made for the movie. What keeps Casablanca as a hallmark in our collective movie going memory is the love story. With the exception of the part where Rick just casually asks Ilsa if she wanted to get married, a truly boss move on Bogart's part, the love story feels very natural, and realistic. Even a violence craving, Scorsese/Tarantino loving person like myself can't help but feel the plight of Rick and Ilsa, two humans in an extreme rut. 9/10",Casablanca

I like the atmosphere of Casablanca itself, a place where no one intends to spend much time but many people get stuck. I like how we meet the characters first and then find out the events that have shaped their uncomfortable looks. Rick is a great character.Casablanca has tons of classic lines - here's looking at you, of all the gin joints, maybe not today maybe not tomorrow, etc. Also, Ingrid Bergman is gorgeous :) A very chivalrous ending too.

771,Imaginist,Casablanca (5/5),10,18 February 2006,"""Casablanca"" is a film that came out in 1942--a time of war and uncertainty. Nobody knew who was going to win the big one, and I believe that is the reason ""Casablanca"" became so popular and has remained so popular ever since. This film is about sacrifice--about doing the right thing even if it is at the expense of one's own happiness. ""Casablanca"" takes place in Morocco towards the beginning of WWII. At this time the Nazis had captured France, but Morocco, a French colony, was still considered to be free; however, Nazi influence over the nation was growing ever more. In fact, it could easily be said that Morocco had become a Nazi puppet nation. It is in this atmosphere that we meet Rick (Bogart in his greatest role), a cynical night club owner who doesn't give a damn about anyone or anything. We soon learn that his miserable outlook on life was caused by a woman named Ilsa (played brilliantly by Bergman) who had jaded him long ago. It is here in Casablanca that Rick plans on spending the rest of his days in isolation--his love of life has been sucked right out of him. However, Rick's world soon comes crashing down when Ilsa comes walking into his ""gin joint"" with her husband Victor (Paul Henreid). Victor is a part of the French Underground and is on the run from the Nazis; his escape route led him directly to Casablanca where he is now searching for two visas to America: one for him and one for Ilsa. In an ironic twist of fate, Rick happens to come across two visas when a friend of his, played by Peter Lorre, gives them to him to hide. Lorre's character was supposed to sell these very visas to Victor and Ilsa, and had arranged for a meeting at Rick's bar. Unfortunately, Lorre's character is arrested and thus Rick gets the visas. However Rick does not realize that these visas are for Ilsa and her husband, and Ilsa does not realize that the bar belongs to Rick, so when they meet it is by complete chance. Soon enough, Victor and Ilsa learn that it is Rick who has the visas and thus they try to persuade him to sell the visas to them. Rick is still bitter about being jaded by Ilsa long ago and therefore refuses to give them any such pleasure--Rick wants revenge. However Ilsa plans to persuade Rick, and in doing so she falls back in love with him--she is prepared to leave Victor for Rick, so long as Rick agrees to give Victor the visa. Rick agrees to the terms, and we soon have an uneasy feeling about the whole situation. This good man, Victor, may be getting a visa, but he is loosing a wife, and we know from Rick's experience that when people suddenly loose lovers they also loose their interest in life, and Victor cannot afford to give up his fight against the Nazis. It is here we see Rick's true character shine through all the cynicism; he engineers a plot that ensures that both Victor AND Ilsa get on that plane to America. Rick not only gives up any chance of getting out of Casablanca, but he also gives up Ilsa so that Victor may have her and that the both of them may continue their valiant underground fight against the Nazis. Rick also realizes that Casablanca has become too dangerous a place for Ilsa, and at the same time too dangerous a place for him as he is going to be punished for helping Victor, who is an enemy of the Nazis. Rick is prepared to sacrifice everything for a cause larger than himself, and that is why this film was so appropriate for the time in which it was made. ""Casablanca"" reminded America that they were now in a war and that sacrifice was going to be necessary of everyone--even those who wanted nothing to do with the world. Rick is the kind of person that we should all regard as a hero, for he puts aside his bitterness and even his own happiness for the sake of something vastly more important. Rick ensures that one of the underground movement's most valuable figures escapes the Nazis grip. However, Rick needed some inspiration in order to perform this valiant act. I believe that he was inspired by Victor, and came to realize that this man was an incredible human being. I also believe that Rick comes to realize that true love is doing what is best for a person, and not what is best for one's self, and thus he gives Ilsa up in order to ensure her safety. Rick was inspired by both patriotism and his devout love to Ilsa. Although Rick's actions may have been the result of some inspiration, they too would come to affect someone else: the chief of the French police in Casablanca (played wonderfully by Claude Rains). Here is a man who hates the Nazis but obeys their commands because it is in his best interest. However, when Claude's character sees the valiant actions of Rick, he too decides to denounce the Nazis. Besides the wonderful message and a host of intriguing characters such as Rick, ""Casablanca"" offers so much more: wonderful lighting, cinematography and acting, suspense, drama, romance, and some of the best lines ever written. Even the end of the movie is more than just a message; it also leaves us with a bitter-sweet taste, as Rick receives nothing and gives up everything. As stated, this was the kind of sacrificial attitude needed during WWII, and it is an attitude that continues to ring loud and clear throughout all desperate times. ""Casablanca"" deserves and receives: 5 out of 5 stars.Copyright 2006 Imaginist",Casablanca

The casting, direction, acting, score, lighting, script... All mesh together simply perfectly in a way I've never seen on any other movie.

776,kevinmanf,It embodies the magic of classic cinema - one of the most watchable of all films,10,5 March 2006,"Casablanca is a fine example of the truism that the great classics never lose there power. With a plot that is apparently simple yet delves into universal themes that are still true today, a series of wonderful characters, some joyous and witty dialogue, a nostalgic score and a great melancholic setting, Casablanca is rightly regarded as one of the treasures of this art. Watch this film as much as you can and you will realise that it achieves what is only in the reach of great movies: it improves with time, uplifting you, purging you, and giving you a taste of what people call, the ""magic of cinema."" The film uses World War II as a device to set two lovers' personal tragedy against the greater larger tragedy that was the war. We have Rick (Humphrey Bogart), a charismatic, cold, hard hearted bar owner who sticks his neck out for nobody and who is going by his duties until one night, his wounds are re-opened with the arrival of Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman). In a series of flashbacks that have always seemed poignant to me, we learn that Rick and Ilsa were once lovers in Paris. Well, that was what Rick thought until the entrance of the Nazi regime in Paris when he was suddenly abandoned by her without any precise explanation. Seeing her in Casablanca accompanied by her husband Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) after all those years since Paris brings back those memories he tried so hard to avoid confronting. Why Casablanca, why ""of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she had to walk into mine?"" Being hunted by this question is what avoids Rick handing Ilsa and her husband the letters of transit - letters Victor needs to flee the grasp of the Nazi in Casablanca so that he can carry on his fight against this evil.Rick's cafe is, metaphorically speaking, the other great character in the film. It's exotic in look and evokes a feeling of fascination. I've always thought that the contrast between the nazi terror the outside world is embroiled in with the mostly joyful and the adventurous atmosphere of Rick's Cafe provides an element of hope and security the film needs. It also provides the setting for which a series of fascinating characters and adventures are displayed. In it, we have Major Strasser, the German officer who will do all it takes to make sure Victor never leaves Casablanca (that would be too dangerous for the Nazis), Ugarte (Peter Lorre) the strange thief who stole the letters of transit and gave them to Rick arguing that ""I (he) have many a friend in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me, you are the only one I trust."" But of all the characters (including Sam the piano player whose song ""As Time Goes By"" remains immortal and Sydney Greenstreet as Signor Ferrari, the man who can get you anything), none is more fascinating nor brings me the most pause than Captain Renault (Claude Rains) in a landmark performance. He is a corrupt officer, but likable, funny and because he attempts to understand the persona of Rick, he provides the ultimate link between the audience and the movie's hero. Humphrey Bogart gives what is perhaps his most recognised performance; there is a certain charm in the way he talks, smokes, sidesteps adversities and pretends he is a tough guy whilst we can sense a hidden wound inside him. And Ingrid Bergman just shines the screen: she is the innocent beauty the film needs to emphasize Rick's initial cruelty towards her and in the end, his courage and kindness.Casablanca is above all, about self sacrifice; sacrificing personal interests for a better universe, for the defeat of the Nazi regime, for a better society in a world filled with evil. The famous final sequence is so direct in its manifestation of this that it works more like a parable than a sequence in a movie. In times of despair when there is little hope, Casablanca is one of the film's I turn to for hope and redemption. There are countless of great sequences each with something exciting happening. To me the greatest and most meaningful is when some Nazi soldiers gather round the piano and sing an ominous song to the ""Fatherland"". It makes everyone in the Rick's cafe very uncomfortable. That's when Paul Heinried instructs the orchestra to play the French national anthem, the""Marseilles"". Everyone starts to sing. The Nazis are silenced. The music takes over. I found my eyes on the verge of tears.This is an undisputed masterpiece, a treasure that remains fresh with each viewing.",Casablanca
777,dan80074,Simply the Greatest Film of all Time,10,27 July 2008,"Spoilers are ahead but come on who hasn't seen this film.First off Casablanca in my eyes reigns as the greatest movie of all time with the Godfather close behind. The whole movie is a memorable scene, but since there are so many memorable ones, its hard to name them all. The battle of anthems when the drunken German Nazi officers are singing the German national anthem in Rick's cafe and then Victor gives the cue for the French National anthem and Rick approves and the club soon drowns out the Drunken German officers. This is truly one of the most memorable scenes in the movie and of all time. Also the performances in the movie are top notch. Bogie in his prime was perfect as the heartless club drunk who sticks his neck out for no one. The supporting cast in Claude Rains, Bergman, and Henrid. The movie is perfect in the sense for all of those who have had to make a hard choice in life. Rick had to make the choice between trading out Victor and keeping llsa for himself or doing the right thing and helping out his old flame and her one true love. The film is great in all aspects. The directing is also incredible. Curtiz did a great job. Overall I would recommend this movie for any movie lover.10/10",Casablanca

Being set during a global war that was right in front of a global population's face; being centered around individualized conflicts that a global population can relate to (love, right/wrong, risky entrepreneurship); and having the story be acted out by actors and actresses with 2nd to none self control (Humphrey Bogart), the film has absolutely all the ingredients for a classic.

I thought that the two main characters were perfectly fit for this movie. The protagonist, Rick has certain suave air to himself, which allows the audience to like him at first sight. His attitude shows neutrality with a hint of passion at the same time. Ilsa, the love interest, makes one see a different side to Rick. I would have to say the police captain was my favorite character due to the fact that he brought comic relief while staying in the realm of being serious.

Every scene seems like it was shot less as a method of capturing a story, but more as if trying to paint a beautiful picture. The sets sometimes seem to frame characters at important moments in the plot and the heavy use of contrast to create very shadowy scenes sets the mood for a mysterious romance so perfectly that you can only call it a masterpiece. I found the acting to be masterful.

785,davelucas1974,TheMovieFrog Reviews: Casablanca,10,5 April 2013,"To view the entire review, please visit us at www.TheMovieFrog.com So, what do you write about a film that has been discussed and lauded for seventy years? Is it a timeless classic about love, loyalty, honor, and sacrifice or the greatest piece of corn-pone pro-war propaganda ever visited upon the American public? Well, the answer is yes...and yes. It is all of those things and more.It is, first and foremost, a classic story of love and sacrifice, almost biblical in the way that it is layed out. Lazlo is the Christ- like figure. He has sacrificed everything: his safety, his freedom, and the purpose of his life to the cause of inspiring others to rise up and fight the Nazis. The only sacrifice he will not make is leaving behind the woman that he loves. Ilsa is his inspiration and the thing that keeps him going.In turn, Lazlo's example of ultimate sacrifice inspires others to sacrifice for the greater good as well. His ability to inspire is demonstrated most dramatically and obviously in the scene where he leads all the patrons of Rick's in song. You can see in the faces of everyone joining in all the pain, fear, and uncertainty of living in a world turned upside down fade away to be replaced by a greater sense of pride and purpose. It is a very powerful moment in the film. However, this man's greater power is in how he impacts and inspires individuals from Ilsa, to Rick, to Renault. Rick has every reason to despise the man, yet it is not just Ilsa that leads him to break precedent and have a drink with the couple.Is the film a little corny? Well, yes, but only in the best tradition of the time. The dialog is fantastic, but when every other line is a zinger, it does stretch believability a bit. No city has ever been populated by that many people who are that witty that much of the time.

786,hapiores,good,9,30 March 2005,"Casablanca was a mystery to me until a few weeks ago. Somehow I never felt great interest about it, although I'd heard for a long time that it was a great movie. Now it's difficult to explain how I feel about it. I understand why it is a great movie: the actors, the background, the characters, the storyall of that. Although it was not a ""love at first sight"" the movie left something in me. However  and I must apologize to those that are true fans of the movie  when I started thinking about it I felt it was very difficult to appreciate it to the fullest, simply because of it's age. I know this has more to do with me that with the movie itself, but the format, the direction, the acting, well, the structure of the movie, is very related with it's time (obviously). This is not a critic, just something that I'd noticed for a long time and now had the opportunity to express: most of the movies below a certain date (for me maybe 1970) report to things that a younger generation has some difficulty apprehending ( it was in the mid nineties that I became more aware of the movie world), mostly because what was interesting and new 60 years ago is not necessarily so now. This feeling is more about all the other movies than about Casablanca itself. It's very natural to see it, without thinking it's an old movie; somehow it feels right. Only with Citizen Kane have I felt the same. Of course it's remarkable that so many years after it was made it still holds something special. About the restwell, forgive the relief.",Casablanca

790,eolas_pellor,An actor's movie...and one of the best!,10,29 November 2006,"If there was ever a movie that proved the old saw, ""there are no small parts, only small actors,"" this is it. While I usually feel that directors are responsible for the greatness of films, not actors, this is certainly a case to test that rule. The more than capable cast give, almost to a one, riveting performances; consider how, in a very few minutes of screen time, Peter Lorre, or Sydney Greenstreet, capture not only our attention, but the essence of the shady, disreputable characters they play. There is an ocean of sublime performance in Lorre's deliver of the ""You despise me, don't you?"" line; hams like Costner, Cruise and die Caprio should be forced to watch him over and over, until they get it right.Or consider Conrad Veidt (Major Strasser), who in life had fled from the Nazis, and despised them, but gave far more than a caricature or stock performance as an evil Prussian; watch how he probes Rick in the scene in the Café Americain and read the conflict in his eyes as he gives a truly nuanced read to lines that could have flopped in the hands of a lesser actor.And then there is S.Z. Sakall's performance as the head waiter, Carl; we sense that the actor had, in his mind, a full back story that is barely alluded to in the script, save for a single time when a waiter calls him ""Professor"". That is richness at a Tolkeinian level.Of course, a good deal of the strength of this movie, and the characters in it, derives from the excellent script; but this script changed and developed as the film shoot progressed (a very famous story), and as the writing team changed, and changed again. It is the actors fleshing out the roles that made the story and the brilliant ending. Not to say that Director Micahel Curitz was just along for the ride, but he managed to capture art by seeing what would work, and where to go next  an unusual kind of brilliance.And, what can be said about the depth of Humphrey Bogart's or Ingrid Bergman's acting? Thank the gods of film that the roles were not given to Ronald Regan or Ann Sheridan; what a hash they would have made of this.Competent camera work, lighting and set design show that it isn't a huge budget that makes a great picture; nor, at 102 minutes running time, can length be the key ingredient in a first class film. The self indulgent movie makers of today should take note  why insist of inflicting bloated budgets on the industry, and bloated 3 hour ordeals on the public when so much more can be done with so much less?",Casablanca
791,sawyerdog,awesome,9,15 October 2015,Personally I thought this was one of the better movies that I have seen in years. The acting was incredible the characters seemed so perfectly cast in their role. Humphrey Bogart delivers his lines perfectly and smoothly. Speaking of that all of the dialogue spoken in this movie just seems as smooth as butter. The lighting throughout the whole movie was very expressive and this film to me had a perfect setting. The setting was away from the war but in it at the very same time. I went into this movie that I had never seen before with certain expectations of what it would be like. Different those expectations are but this film went above and beyond and delivered.,Casablanca
792,Dezcaughtit88,Casablanca Review,9,9 March 2016,"Casablanca was one of the most beautifully filmed and acted and deserves to be considered one of the best movies of its era. The use of light in this film in showing the seriousness of the characters was very prevalent. It showed the uncertainty of the characters. As the story progresses we learn more and more about the characters pasts and after a while you start to think you know a character but, their motivations and intentions turn out to be different then originally thought. I enjoyed that aspect because it kept me on my toes. The acting was very very well done especially by Humphrey Bogart, his take on Rick Blaine was seemingly tough and hard to crack but as the movie continues we see his more emotional side and who he is as a person. Overall the film was very beautiful in its camera-work, acting, lighting, and even the sets and costumes. Definitely one of the best films of its time and also one of the best films in the history of American cinema.",Casablanca
793,Icarus_prime,La La Land before La La Land even existed...74 years ago.,8,16 August 2017,"The enduring universal appeal of Casablanca lies within its classic Hollywood narrative style, with archetypal characters and plot beats that's as straightforward as what they represent for a romance movie.I have a certain fondness for romantic movies with bittersweet resolutions because that's when the movie can showcase a wide range of complex emotions for the characters and from the audience; neither simply riding off the sunset or all doom and gloom.Yes, everyone knows that the movie is about sacrificing love for the greater good, as heartbreaking as it may be. We observe that with sympathy within Rick and later Llsa. I think that's the main aspect the audience cheers for, not simply the romance between Rick and Llsa because the movie is too important for that. I wonder if some might interpret the love between them back in Paris is just all fleeting; a way to overcome (or rather forget) another heartbreak. A cruel cycle no doubt.The actions by the characters in Casablanca seem flawed because they themselves are flawed. But we must also remember that it also makes sense from a narrative perspective given how Rick used to be a freedom fighter. And yet, what stirred my heart and I'm sure for a lot of people is that despite the logic, our emotions can't help but disagree, just like Llsa later on. So it's essential a role reversal in how the characters feel by the end of the movie.From what I said in the first paragraph, La La Land owes a great deal to Casablanca.",Casablanca

I was constantly faced with the mention somewhere of this film or quotes from it. In General, it happened. The beginning was delayed immediately and seemed promising, but somehow unexpectedly quickly came the final scene and the film ended. From the point of view of emotional coloring, the movie is very pleasant, there are moments for reflection in the aftertaste. In terms of expectations-Casablanca did not meet my expectations. The biggest disappointment is the lack of epicness, which was suspected thanks to the presence of three Oscars, universal gasps and comparisons with such a masterpiece of cinema as "" gone with the wind.""the film is interesting, with a ""tasty"" game of actors. Dialogues me jobs indeed admired, sake of them can be even indulge, having revised picture still times, but in a whole the film leaves impression virtuoso theatrical setting.

But it was still a good movie none the less. I just didn't find it as good as a lot of other people would think. The acting was great, as Humphrey Bogart always is. The story was also very interesting. I liked the twist at the end. So simple, yet so complex. Thats kind of what the whole movie is. Very simple, but yet at the same time somewhat complex. And i think what makes it complex is Bogart's character. Its so hard to read his thoughts. Thus, displaying the good acting by Bogart. I would suggest this movie to any guy who's girlfriend is begging him to see a romance movie. Trust me, this will be the best one you will ever see.",Casablanca
800,koenvanderberger,Classic,9,6 January 2021,"Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and Bergman as Ilsa Lund just perfect examples of a different time. Showing little emotions, but still immense depth. This movie is just so classic that it is in its own league. The atmosphere, the old style of filming, the music and the actors. You cannot make this type of movies, not now not in the future. Happy that this movie was made and still appreciated.",Casablanca
801,FilmFanatic09,Casablanca,10,5 December 2006,"No film captures the classical Hollywood style quite so well as ""Casablanca."" The film seamlessly combines romance and intrigue in its exotic location, remarkably conveyed by mere studio sets. The black and white cinematography is perfect for capturing and adding mood to the smoke filled rooms, war torn city streets, and foggy airports that compose the world of this film. Despite seeming a product of its time, ""Casablanca"" is truly a timeless piece of entertainment. It would be futile to recount the plot here. Even those who have never seen the film are likely to be aware that ""Casablanca"" is the film where Ingrid Bergman is forced to chose between old lover Humphrey Bogart and her resistance leader husband (the often overlooked Paul Henreid). Bergman as Ilsa Lund, the center of the love triangle, is magnificent here. She communicates with such ease the very different types of love she feels for each man in her life, and we sympathize with her struggle. Of course, Bogart too created a legendary performance as café owner Rick Blaine. Seeing him transform from the man who will stick his neck out for nobody to someone content with making a great self-sacrifice is one of the joys of the film. Bogart and Bergman are leading players among equals however, and are rightly matched by numerous character actors, not the least of which is Claude Rains. In his portrayal of French Vichy officer Captain Renault, he hits the perfect notes to show off both the corrupt and goodhearted sides of the character. He also gets to deliver some of the film's best comedic one-liners. Another unforgettable actor is Dooley Wilson as the congenial piano player Sam, who of course provides the quintessential rendition of ""As Time Goes By"". Director Michael Curtiz certainly does these fine actors justice. The film has some striking visuals too. Be on the lookout for the raindrops on a letter which look more like tears, and the symbolism provided by a bottle of water towards the film's end. Viewers aware of the many troubles that plagued the production of ""Casablanca,"" should be amazed at the manner in which the film as a whole is able to so greatly transcend the sum of its parts. When you pause and really consider it, ""Casablanca"" is a much simpler film than many others also hailed as classics. It was based on an unremarkable (and unproduced) stage play, shot on a modest budget, and released with the thought of the natural appeal it would carry for its wartime audiences. And yet it has endured so long beyond that. Much has been made on the subject of reading ""Casablanca"" as a political allegory, with Rick representing isolationist America, Lazlo the Free French, so on, and so on. This rightfully compels the film student in me. But in all actuality, the romantic in me is much more captivated by the story of three little people caught up in the problems of a crazy world. The nuances of the characters, the sense of urgency ominously hanging over every scene, and the tear jerking story of love lost, found, and lost once more in the name of a bigger cause are the elements that stay with us. For me, as well as countless other film lovers around the world, the first viewing of ""Casablanca"" proves to be the start of a very beautiful friendship.",Casablanca
802,Mr_Hulot,One of the best.,10,13 August 2002,"***Spoilers***Casablanca is certainly one of the most exciting and touching films ever made.  We like it's main characters because of what they do, they are willing to sacrifice there most vital relationships for the sake of a greater cause.  They represent the best within us.The story is set in Casablanca a Moroccan seaport that is the last portal of escape for Europeans who are fleeing the spreading menace of fascism and the World War. Casablanca is full of intrigue and danger a city full of refugees from all over Europe as well as those ready to aid them (for a price) or prey on them.Humphrey Bogart plays Rick Blaine, the tough cynical owner of a restaurant where expatriates congregate.  He reveals himself at first to be a selfish and cold hearted man.  As the story progresses we learn that despite his motto `I stick my neck out for no one' he in the past has placed his life in danger for many worthy causes.  He is a romantic and idealist whose spirit has been crushed by the harshness of the world.Soon we learn the exact circumstances of his disillusionment.  Ilsa Laszlo, played by Ingrid Bergman, wanders into his restaurant, accompanied by Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid a hero of the anti-Nazi resistance.  They need letters of transit to escape Casablanca, and continue to fight the good fight, and soon learn that Rick has got them.  Rick however wants to retain his political neutrality, and we soon learn, is bitter that Ilsa walked out of him during a love affair that they had in Paris years ago.At its heart, the film is about the need to sacrifice personal happiness for the greater good.  It probably cannot be divorced from its historical context. It was released in America when the country had just plummeted into World War 2.  In order to prevent the world from being annihilated or enslaved, ordinary people had to put aside their petty grievances and find within themselves that which is heroic.  That's what this movie is about.It's also enormously entertaining. The film boasts wonderful performances by Claude Rains as Captain Louis Renault, another idealist trying to pass himself off as a cynical profiteer.  Peter Loore is delightfully slimy as Ugarte, a petty thief who tries to turn every situation to his advantage. As countless others have already said the dialogue is second to none, providing a plethora of instantly quotable lines.Casablanca, is rousing, thrilling and deeply moving.  It gives us the great themes within a framework small enough to feel personal.  This is moviemaking at it's best.",Casablanca
803,ostergaardof4,It's a classic for a reason,9,3 July 2010,"Casablanca Michael Curtiz (1942)Casablanca is many things, but mostly it was a perfect storm of production values at the time it was made. In 1941 the world was just getting to the worst of its second self involved war and Hollywood was at the height of production studio centered glory, open and ripe for the attention of the power-jealous paranoids of the 50s. The people making Casablanca had everything needed to make the most popular movie in history (sorry Titanic, lets see you attract people over and over at festivals –what? You can't? Oh, that's right, you blew your load.).They had exotic settings, a ready made situation to forever tug at people's heartstrings, timeless leading actors (there is no era in fashion history that Bogart and Bergman would look bad in) ridiculously awesome supporting cast of character actors—the breadth of which I doubt will ever be seen again (a rant for another day!).Best movie ever made, no, not critically or technically. Critics tend to allow Casablanca into the annals of Best Films Ever because it is so enduringly and solidly good. Nothing big. Nothing fancy. No great arguments about hubris, mortality, social issues – what have you – like Citizen Kane or All About Eve. Just Nazis and unfulfilled sex. I ask you, what is wrong with this?The direction does nothing but build tension and alert viewers to whose a baddie and whose a goodie. What you don't see, in fact, is the direction. Casablanca is seamlessly plot-tastic. And what a plot. Few works of fiction sell unrequited love so convincingly or realistically. Not only do they acknowledge that a person can love two different people equally and still retain honor and nobility and all that, but we actually buy the motivations behind all three people in the triangle. AND! It is resolved in a perfectly tragic pit of hope for the future without relying on the ""babies = hope"" crutch. More intricately, political intrigue and double crossing are never going to get old. The only thing that would ever truly date this movie is the political intrigue. Because Nazis are actual, historical bad guys, and tied to a very specific place and time, it's possible that cultures outside of SUA, and/or a couple generations down the line will not care so quickly or easily for ""the troubles of three little people"" on the run from the Third Reich. Luckily! There is a slick little intro with a model globe and voice-over which introduces the time and place very nicely. If you were an alien and knew nothing of earth history, but were profoundly human—sentimentally—you'd get it. Where the direction picks up after all this awesome, is in the details. Every time I watch Casablanca I find a new detail that reinforces a character or setting. Usually they're shadows. The shadow of Rick opening his safe, the dancing girl shadow in The Blue Parrot, the shadow of scurrying French underground braves... They add depth to otherwise static blocking and cardboard sets. The continual usage of shadow is probably my favorite, non-plot related thing. When combined with the fact that everyone smokes constantly in this movie, the world of northern Africa is orientalized in the sexiest of all possible ways—subtly. Two things I've noticed that can actually be considered mistakes: Hand- wound mending. One of the shadows shows Rick opening a safe...he does not close it in the same scene... hm... First viewing, I fell asleep. Bored. Hated it. I don't know when I watched it the first time and liked it. I honestly don't remember, but by my first year of college I couldn't stop watching it. Bought a poster in an antique store, hung it in my dorm room as a declaration of my superior taste to all the Animal House posters. Consequently I become immediate friends with the girl across the hall who's choice was Cool Hand Luke. We were so damn cool. They were destroyed by asbestos and we had to buy a new ones, not vintage.

The writers produced script with deep characters that exchange witty dialogue throughout the movie's interesting plot.  `Casablanca' opens in the foreign city of.....Casablanca.  The world is in turmoil and the drama flares inside the city walls.  European emigrants flee from the German war machine to Casablanca, the gateway to America.  But in the midst of the carnage and despair of the world war, Humphrey Bogart is having some love troubles.  And the personal demons Bogart struggles with has entertained audiences for decades. 	Bogart plays the character Rick who is perfectly cynical.  He is a man who `sticks his neck out for no one.', and it would seem that Rick doesn't love for no one either.  Not since Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) broke his heart in Paris.   Rick is soon dragged, kicking and screaming, into a love triangle worthy of Jerry Springer when Ilsa comes to Casablanca with a husband on her arm.  Rick must face his demons, define his values, and make a choice between his happiness or the hope of the world. 	In a film that oozes with Americana the viewer might find an allegory in Casablanca.  Rick could be a neutral America who tried to keep their feet dry when the world around it was drowning.  And Ilsa could symbolize a desperate Europe, who's only hope is in America.  There are striking similarities between the characters and the world at the time of World War II. 	When combined, the acting, the original and complex story, the clever writing, Casablanca holds all the elements of a classic film.  It has entertained audiences for years and therefore transcends time. Though Casablanca may be for a more mature movie goer, it is worth seeing if your ready to be weaned off of Hollywood's recycled movies.  There is a very good reason why Casablanca is one of the most quoted movies in film history, and that reason should compel everyone to see a piece of American history.  Or, `You'll regret it.

805,Shortee16,A classic romantic and political plot,8,24 May 2004,"Casablanca is a monumental film in the history of Hollywood and film-making itself. As many of following films have borrowed a similar story line and people all over quote lines from it lacking the knowledge that Casablanca is the film form which it originated. This is a subtle blend of love and loss along with the underworld gang politics. It takes place in a town called Casablanca in Morrocco. This is the place known to be ht elast chance of reaching the dream of a ticket out to America, the land of freedom, this being specified by the fact it takes place during WWII. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman make a beautiful on screen couple, who give off incredible chemistry not only romantically speaking but also acting wise. Bogart could't have added or taken away form his portrayal of a top man in the underground during those times. His natural charm shone through and there is such a mysteriousness to him that not only catches the audience but also captivates many women who surround him. Ingrid Bergman possess a flowing beauty that aided her performance of the only woman sane enough to break Bogart's heart. Casablanca is not only about a romance gained and then lost, but is deals with life back in WWII, when so much was kept as secrets and people lived in fear for their lives and future. Director Michael Curtiz and the writers definitely reflected their ingenious creativity by subtly placing a good amount of symbolism in Casablanca. Now aside from the shining stars Bogart and Bergamn it can not be left unsaid that what really made Casablanca spark was the presence of Sam's soothing piano playing. All in all the day Casablanca was introduced to its faithful fans was ""the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""",Casablanca

It is also among the most dramatically powerful, depicting moral dilemmas which, while not necessarily specifically applicable in a peacetime society, do speak to some universal ethical code. The last 20-30 minutes are filled with the best plot twists I've ever witnessed (hell, the last 10 minutes for that matter).Bogart shows an emotional range in this movie which is roughly akin, in terms of pleasant surprises, to Jim Carrey's in the Truman Show.  It was a breakthrough role, and probably his best character.  Of course, the screenplay is full of quotes that have been parroted (if incorrectly) down through the decades, but the lesser-known bits of dialogue in between are just as great (""aren't you the kind of girl who tells?"").Everyone who reads this review has undoubtedly already seen the movie, so I won't bother plugging it.

811,LVJeff,Humphrey Bogart is the Man,10,19 June 2000,"One thing is for certain: Humphrey Bogart is the man who speaks for himself. I just watched this movie at last, after trying to find an opportunity to watch it for quite some time now.  I've never watched Bogart before, and Casablanca was as good a start as any.  Let me say that I am quite impressed!  We are living in a world today where men try to emulate and women are quite taken by those men who are the paragon of the tough, solid man, often with an attitude, which is all the while a somewhat thin front for a sense of sentiment and nobility.  Or, to put it another way, we love the bad-ass with a heart and a sense of right.  With all the actors that we see nowadays, and all the characters that they portray, it's easy to forget who many of these Hollywood molds owe their respects to.  And, in this movie, Bogart is the man, one of the originals, a 1942 tough act, class act, a man who shows others how to be a man.This is his movie all the way, and he makes it a man's movie.  Don't get settled in on Ingrid Bergman too much, however beautiful she may be.  She's plays a tough woman, but Bogart is control.  And nevermind Paul Henreid, taller and perhaps more handsome than Bogart.  He may have the heroic reputation, but Bogart's cynicism makes him identifiable.  The things that Bogart's character, Rick, went through, and the new situation he is presented with, were very familiar to me and, I'm sure, to others.  What do you do when the one you love is with another?  What do you do when there is nothing wrong or, worse yet, it is the better thing to do for her to be with the other?  What do you do when the power then lies within you to decide whom she will then belong to, you or him?  Weaker men would fold.  Bogart takes the situation and tells it where it can go.I was quite happy with what I saw as the movie finished up.  It was a movie, as others have boasted in its name, that required no special effects, no fancy twisted storyline, and no distracting side plots.  It's a tight package, wrapped up nicely and presented almost as straightforward as could be.  Best of all, though, it's a story told about the strength of one character, and one character alone.  It's about his point of view, his dilemma, his solution.  It's about Rick, and only Bogart could have pulled off Rick in this memorable way.  This is Bogart's movie.

Yes, I said the 30's, because Casablanca is much more a product of that decade than the 40's, which would deliver some truly great films. Those ""funny"" characters make Casablanca more like a menagerie than something with an intelligent plan. Humphrey Bogart - a great actor in The Caine Mutiny, Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and even Petrified Forest...but not here. Totally unbelievable and unconvincing as a romantic lead. He doesn't even deliver as an anti-hero in this worn-out, overrated piece of pre-WWII propaganda. Ingrid Bergman - a beautiful lady, and a hundred times better in everything else she did...but a cartoon here. Claude Rains - typical 30's supporting role...goofy, but with a big heart; goes ""straight"" in the end. 30's nonsense.The story - lame and predictable. Why did people love Casablanca? Because it stirred their patriotism at a time when Germany was threatening to bulldoze Great Britain and everywhere else.

I watched this film in my Film Studies Lecture at Kingston University with about 200 other people. I haven't seen many films that are that old, but I now appreciate that these films were for another generation, and used all the technology available at the time to it's fullest, and if it wouldn't of been for these films, we wouldn't see the sort of films we love today. I thought Humphrey Bogart was extremely good in this film - he came across as a very cool character, and by the end I wanted to emulate his unforgettable lines such as: 'Here's Looking At You Kid', and of course the very final line in the film. This film also teaches many valuable lessons, that all of us can learn from. Finally, I recommend this film to everyone because of the epic values it portrays. Believe all the hype surrounding this absolute masterpiece!",Casablanca
818,tkubas1,A Classic Tale,9,19 January 2013,"I've recently got in the habit of watching very old movies. I was scanning through the IMDb top 250 as I often do when I spotted a movie from 1942, Casablanca. I didn't know anything about it except the description. The reason I stopped was because of the extremely high score it had. How could a movie this old be as good as my many favorites? Weeks later I spotted it at the thrift store for fifty cents. I thought I might as well give it a shot for that. I'm glad that I did. Yet another old movie that sheds its age simply because of the compelling story telling.The story takes place in a city named Casablanca. The Germans are trying to arrest two men; Ugarte and Victor Laszlo. They suspect Ugarte has two letters of transit which allow the holder to move freely through German controlled countries so they can get to America. He plans on selling them to Victor Laszlo. Ugarte and Laszlo plan on meeting at Rick's Café Américain a night club of sorts. When they arrive to make the exchange is when the story really takes off. The owner of Rick's Café, Rick Blane, is a very interesting character. You can't quite tell what he's going to do next. He's played by Humphrey Bogart, who does an amazing job playing the cool customer from New York. You don't know whose side he's on, as he says ""I stick my neck out for no one"" The other characters all have great performances as well. Laszlo, Isls Lund and the French captain all add a lot of character to the movie. One person that I loved was the piano player at the club. He didn't have many lines, but with what he did say I found him to have excellent character. You could tell that he's a great friend of Rick's. The French Captain Louis Renault was great. You'll hate him, love him, and back again. He had a great acting dynamic with Rick; they played off each other so well you would think they actually knew each other for a long time. Conrad Veidt, the German leader was more of a political threat than a physical one. He was always bothering the heroes of the story, always trying his best to make their lives miserable. One of the best scenes was when Veidt was leading a sort of pub song with his men at the nightclub and Laszlo leads a chorus of his own overpowering the German's voice. I thought that scene was particularly funny.The storyline is what really shines in this one. Movies made this long ago couldn't rely on special effects. The dialog and script really are delivered perfectly. If you like a story where you can try to figure out how everything all fits together than you'll like this. One aspect of the story involves a love triangle. As you might know I'm not too big on love stories, but this one actually makes sense. A lot of movies have a love story shoe horned in just because; in this one the story truly is interesting. I was honestly wondering what was going to happen with this love triangle believe it or not. My only gripe with it was in the execution. Sometimes it had a small cheese factor. The eye rolls weren't as prevalent as most films for sure. I also want to mention the ending of the film. It tied everything together perfectly. We got closure on all the major plot points. The major characters get their subplots closed. In the end, I felt like everything ended the way I wanted it to end and I felt satisfied.There isn't much to say about the technical aspects of the film. Basically since it's so old all I was hoping for was that graphics wouldn't subtract from the movie. For the most part it's not too distracting. A few of the gunshots looked really unrealistic. Hey, in the end it was more about the story anyway.If you're looking for an old movie that will surprise you with its complex story and great acting you won't be disappointed with this one. You should definitely see it.tkubas1.wordpress.com",Casablanca
819,ProfessionalPotato,Definitely remembering this one,8,14 March 2013,"Honestly the first time I saw this movie I didn't like it as much as most people did, and I just wasn't sure why. At the time I don't think I really got into the story like I had looked forward to, hearing so much about it. But the second time I felt a little better about it. There was a lot of qualities I learned to appreciate in this film, especially the political symbolism and the interesting character development, as well as the artistic perspective involving camera work and editing. I can understand why this is a classic, it is absolutely memorable and unique. I enjoyed the humor and I liked the interesting conflict. But it has definitely one of my most favorite endings.",Casablanca

Desert played for night even at day, Bogart the beautiful and Bergman the brusque, convoluted and borderline irrelevant WWII backdrop that buoys the main action... I love movies that can blend genres and feelings seamlessly, and this one is what -- romance, noir, thriller, comedy, war movie?

822,TheodenLives,The Band Wagon Effect,6,18 January 2006,"I'm a fan of almost everyone who appears in Casablanca, at least in every other movie they were ever in. Bogart, Bergman, Rains, Greenstreet, Lorre, and so on. But I think that Casablanca made its biggest impression when it came out, in the heat of WWII, and its reputation has carried it along ever since. I'm certain that very few will agree with me on this, but I think that many occasional movie watchers and many would-be experts like to chatter about this film's ""greatness"", when in fact, it has very little of that. Number one problem for me is Bogart as anyone's love interest --- think about this: his very best performances weren't romantic, or anywhere near it(I give ""African Queen"" a comedy designation). The other problem is the dated silliness (in the so-called comic characters) that I suppose was put in to balance the seriousness of being stranded in Casablanca with Nazis buzzing around everywhere. Then there's that ever-present song...not bad, but very over-used. Since I know I'll stir up a lot of folks, I apologize for criticizing the ""perfect film"", but there are just too many truly great ones out there to get all blubbery about this one. Entertaining for its time period, but not great. But cheer up, Casablanca fans, we'll always have Gaslight, Notorious, Maltese Falcon, and Treasure of the Sierra Madre'.",Casablanca

824,Himadri,"Sheer entertainment, and also finely crafted",10,21 July 1999,"Is this really a love story? The leading man spends virtually all the film being really nasty to the leading lady, and the only decent thing he does is to give her away at the end to another man! I'd have thought that the real theme of this film is not really ""love"" - the private lives of a few people really don't amount to ""a hill of beans"" - it's heroism. In this respect, Paul Heinreid's part is superbly underplayed: the film would become unbalanced if he outplayed Bogie - he couldn't anyway - but, at the same time, we must think it right that Else ends up with him rather than with Rick. And Henreid is very convincing in projecting this heroism.The whole thing is so irresistibly entertaining, that we often forget how finely crafted it is. The plot is complex, but we always know what's happening - there's even a little sub-plot included (about a young couple desperate to escape) that reflects the central plot. And, although Rick behaves badly through most of the film, director Michael Curtiz is careful to ensure that he never forfeits the audience's sympathy.As for the rest, it's all been said before. The most entertaining film ever made? I wouldn't argue with that. On a par, in my book, with ""The Maltese Falcon"", ""The Third Man"" and ""Singin in the Rain"".",Casablanca
825,Alex-506,"Sorry to be a downer, but here's what I think of Casablanca.",5,9 January 2001,"I do not like Casablanca.  Wait!  Before I'm burned at the stake, hear me out.  One of the problems I have with Casablanca is that it tries to exist on two different plains.  It expects us be drawn into the emotional struggle that Rick undergoes throughout the movie.  But no matter how hard I tried (and believe me I wanted to love this movie), the film failed on the emotional level.  Rick, as played by Humphrey Bogart, seemed horrifically ingenuine.  He continually spewed out dialogue which pandered, even insulted, the audience.  ""I stick my neck out for no one"", ""Rick never drinks with anyone"", etc., etc.   These lines are definitely memorable, but a capable actor could have communicated Rick's veneer of cynicism without words, and trusted the audience's intelligence to figure it out.  Indeed, it is this constantly simplistic dialogue, as well as the cardboard performance by Bogart, that continually held me back.  I couldn't plunge into the emotional power of the film as I wanted to, and indeed I began to grow annoyed by the film because it seemed as if it didn't believe its own convictions.  It seemed as if it would rather be hip than genuine.  The film is not without its strong points, definitely: the great performances by Bergman, Rains and Wilson, the surehanded direction of Curtiz, and the memorable song ""As Time Goes By"".  But Casablanca failed to draw me in emotionally, and also failed to invoke the feeling of Casablanca at that time.  Compared to great films like The Third Man (which invoked the paranoia of Cold War Vienna), Schindler's List (the closing walls of the Holocaust) and Saving Private Ryan (the chaos of war), Casablanca fails miserably in comparison.  Whenever I see Casablanca, I am always a little saddened.  It could have been a great and profound film.  Instead, it is a mediocre escapist entertainment.**/*****",Casablanca
826,bobbaxter,Here's Looking at CASABLANCA,10,10 July 2006,"Occasionally, great films are happy accidents. A HARD DAY'S NIGHT and SINGIN' IN THE RAIN were written and produced in unconventional ways. So was CASABLANCA. It was a wartime romantic melodrama based on an unproduced play. Everybody thought that it would be good, but nobody considered it special.Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman weren't part of the original cast; their roles were originally slated for Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan. George Raft was also considered for the lead. Raft and Reagan were unavailable, though, so the role of Rick Blaine went to the only man who could have played it.The screenplay is another oddity. Julius and Philip Epstein began by extensively revising a stage play called ""Everybody Comes to Rick's"". When the Epsteins were called away to another assignment, Howard Koch took over. Later, the Epsteins returned to collaborate with Koch on the film's final act. Despite the multiple writing credits, the film is very unified.The film is set in French Morocco in 1941. The port city of Casablanca is a stopping point on the refugee trail. Refugees are pouring into the city, but they can't leave without exit visas. Cafe owner Rick Blaine is accidentally left with two letters of transit, documents which allow the bearer to travel without a visa. No sooner do the letters fall into his hands than his former lover, Ilsa Lund (Bergman) arrives with her husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). Laszlo is a charismatic Underground leader sought by the Nazis. Their only hope for escape from Casablanca is the letters of transit held by Rick.Ilsa is torn between the two men. She loves Rick, but she also loves Laszlo. She realizes that she is the inspiration for his work against the Nazis.The background for the love triangle is the film's array of memorable supporting characters. Louis Renault (Claude Rains) is the local police chief who trades exit visas for sexual favors. (The film is surprisingly frank about this.) Ugarte (Peter Lorre) is a small-time thief who is arrested for murder. Ferari (Sidney Greenstreet) is a rival club owner and a key figure in the local black market. There are also the employees of Rick's Cafe, led by Sam (Dooley Wilson). The Germans are led by snarling bully Major Heinrich Strasser (Conrad Veidt). All of these characters and their various story threads are introduced in a long series of scenes depicting a typical night at the Cafe.Movie plots usually follow a three-act structure. CASABLANCA has a more Shakespearean five-act structure. Act 1, which introduces the various characters and subplots, ends with Ilsa's reunion with Rick. Act 2 consists of Rick's reminiscences of his affair with Ilsa. Act 3, which shows Laszlo's futile attempts to get exit visas, ends with his confrontation with a group of Nazis at Rick's. After this, the events of the last two acts (the night of the resistance meeting and the resolution of the love triangle) are inevitable.Some of the film's plot points are pure fiction. For one thing, there's no such thing as a letter of transit. It's a plot device, a McGuffin. Besides, if the Nazis really wanted a person, no document would prevent them from arresting him. For another, even if Ugarte did get letters of transit, he wouldn't have sold them. He certainly would not have given them to Rick. He would have used them to leave Casablanca. These plot points don't make sense. The Epsteins slide them past us with great dialogue and wonderful characters. After all, if Rick doesn't get the letters, we don't have a movie.CASABLANCA is a movie about love and sacrifice. It has one of the greatest endings in movie history. In fact, it has the only ending it can possibly have.",Casablanca
827,dgray-1,Has not aged well,7,8 September 2001,"When seen on a large screen, several of the scenes become comic, especially those in which Bogart is lighting cigarettes.

831,jte6451,Casablanca Review,10,20 February 2019,"""We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we, we lost it until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night."" - Rick BlaineBefore, I wasn't really a huge fan of the romance genre. I don't know if it has something to do with the predictable storyline that always had a happy ending, dramatic moments that seem way too dramatic, or rehashing the same concept of love; it just wasn't my cup of tea. However, there was one film that made me change my views and to fully appreciate romance films, and that film was none other than Casablanca. It seems to have the same typical tropes that you would find in any other romance, but one thing that it did had that sets it apart from most romance films, and that is pure quality. What it ended up being is a beautiful looking and well-told story that has since became legendary.Set during World War II, the story centers around Rick Blaine, an American expatriate and former freedom fighter who now runs a successful nightclub and gambling den in the city of Casablanca. His seemingly peaceful life is then interrupted when his former lover Ilsa arrives in town with her husband, a resistance movement leader who's on the run from the Nazis, and asks for Rick's help to escape to Lisbon, so they can flee to America to continue their cause. Rick is reluctant at first, due to his bitter nature and cynical views on the world caused by his and Ilsa's past relationship falling apart, but now must make a choice between his former lover and a chance for hope as the fate of the war hangs in balance.For 1942, this was considered a landmark achievement in cinema history. The elegant black and white cinematography gives it a timeless feel, the story moves at a steady pace, and it's all accompanied by a beautiful and heartwarming musical score. Also, so many memorable lines that has become iconic.""Of all the gin joints, in all the towns, in all the world, she walks into mine.""The performances are all top notch, namely Claude Rains, Peter Lorre, and Sydney Greenstreet. However, it's the film's two leads, Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, who really shines here. Bogart plays it with charm and has such a hypnotizing screen presence you just can't take your eyes off him. Rick, at first, may seem bitter and wants nothing to do with the world's problems, but you soon start to warm up to him when you know a bit more about him and how he once had a happy and peaceful life with the love of his life until it was taken away from him, leaving him cold and heartbroken. You can feel the same for Bergman's Ilsa; how she seemingly lost her husband, but met Rick and both lived a happy life, only to find out her husband is alive and, in haste, left Rick without explanation. You start to actually care about these two when you find out more about them.Overall, Casablanca still remains as a high-water mark of the genre that gets better with ever viewing. After over 70 years, this timeless love story still stands the test of time, and I do believe I have a newfound respect for the genre.""Here's looking at you kid.""Final Verdict: 10/10 with.... eh screw it, the Epic Seal of Awesomeness.",Casablanca

After watching this picture your faith in humanity is once again restored. These people are the real superheroes, not the cartoon characters worshiped in today's films. 
Rick Blaine and Victor Lazlo where no Redford or Newman when it came to looks, but damn if they weren't sexier! Who knew after watching Bogie in so many 30's gangster flicks that he would be the epitome of love and romance in the 40's. And how can you not help but love and feel empathy for Ingrid Bergman as we watch her struggle with the love she feels for Rick and the pride and loyalty she feels for Victor? As always, Claude Rains, Perez Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, S.Z. Sakall, Conrad Veidt, Dooley Wilson, Leonid Kinskey and the remaining supporting cast are remarkable.

835,billylarrick,The greatest movie ever made,10,15 September 2015,"Casablanca is the pinnacle of what filmmaking can achieve and stands as a testament to the power of phenomenal acting and the power of a compelling story. A timeless classic, this movie stands above all others and should be watched again and again.CharactersThe brilliance of Casablanca begins and ends with Humphrey Bogart. Rick Blaine is the performance of a lifetime given by the world's most skilled actor. Here we see Bogart's incredible range on full display; he is the cutthroat and cynical saloon owner, the romantic in flashback, the jilted lover, and the heartbroken man who is torn between choosing the woman he loves and doing what he knows to be right. Bogart is entirely believable in this role, so much so that it's hard to imagine Bogey isn't the cynic with the heart of a sentimentalist that he portrays. When watching Casablanca and seeing the story of Rick's past romance with Ilsa unfold we feel his pain, we share his anger and his confusion as if it was our own, whether we are watching for the first time or the hundredth time. Rick is every man who has ever been in love, who has turned cynical after having his heart broken, and who will do anything—even sacrifice his own happiness —to ensure her happiness. To be able to connect with such a complex character is possible because of Bogart's genuine delivery. Bogart's role as Rick will stand the test of time as one of the most legendary performances in film history.Along with Bogey, the support he receives from every other actor in this film is astounding. Ingrid Bergman is flawless as Ilsa Lund. Her cold demeanor towards Bogey throughout most of the film combined with the frustrated love of his character creates the perfect chemistry. Bergman holds her cards tight to her chest and keeps us guessing as to whether she will choose to rejoin Rick or escape with her husband Victor Laszlo and even more importantly, which man she loves more. Rains portrayal of the French captain whose loyalty ""blows with the prevailing wind"" is brilliant in its own right and in no way overshadowed by Bogey and Bergman. Part of what makes Rain's performance so impressive is that he is able to add a level of comic relief to the film while still maintaining the seriousness of a captain of the police when the occasion calls for it. He is both the man who can shut down Rick's Café for gambling while collecting his winnings. While Rick, Ilsa, and Rains are the primary focus of Casablanca, what puts this movie over the top is the depth of talent it receives from its secondary actors. There are strong performances all around from Sydney Greenstreet as the profit oriented businessman Senior Ferrari, Peter Lorre as the sleazy criminal Ugarte, and Sam as the warm-hearted and amenable pianist. These characters may not contribute on a large scale but their performances maintain the film's high quality of acting.Dialogue: Along with acting, what separates this film from all others are its lines. Not just the half dozen that appear in the American Film Institute's most famous movie quotes, twice as many as any other film, but lines like ""You'll get along beautifully in America,"" ""There are vultures, vultures everywhere,"" or ""I stick my neck out for nobodyA wise foreign policy"" are what make this movie not only powerful but enjoyable to watch. It all starts with great acting but to be the best movie of all time you have to have a great script and Casablanca has the best.Music: ""As time goes by"", ""Knock on wood"", and ""The Marseilles"" deliver a lot for just a few songs. The Marseilles scene is arguably the most emotional musical performance is cinema history, made especially powerful by the fact that many of the French citizens in the café were real-life emigrants during the war and shed real tears as they sang in the movie. While ""As Time Goes By"" may be the song most famously remembered for Sam to play again, it is ""The Marseilles"" that marks the turning point in the film. Showing the French citizens overpowering the Germans serves as a powerful symbol of the French resistance to the Nazis and was also written for an American audience that had just entered the war following Pearl Harbor only months earlier. The audience feels the genuine struggle of war-torn Europe instead of the artificial feel of propaganda that made some other films feel like a war time commercial and a cheesy ploy for enlistment. This scene is also of significant importance to the story because of what happens right before it. While it is Laszlo who tells the band to play the Marseilles, the band does not do so until Rick nods for them to go ahead. In this moment Rick does much more than tell the band to play, he breaks the last and most important of his precedents that he had maintained before Ilsa arrived: his neutrality. By nodding for the band to play, Rick knows that he is symbolically siding with the French and that the Germans will now view him as a threat to their mission to arrest Laszlo. It is in this moment that Rick makes the decision to help Laszlo and to give up Ilsa and his café. Scenes like this display the powerful acting at work in Casablanca and the beauty in the power that one look and a simple nod can have.Casablanca is simply the greatest movie of all time. Citizen Kane and The Shawshank Redemption cannot hold a candle to this movie and with the current trend towards emphasizing CGI over acting, it is possible no film ever will.

If you have to watch one movie from this era, my recommendation would always be Casablanca. It has romance, politics, comedy, action, drama... everyone can find something about this movie to like. Except maybe horror movie fanatics. Bergman and Bogart give fantastic performances and there's a chemistry between them that really makes the lost romance believable.The movie is meant as a commentary on America joining WWII, set just before Pearl Harbor and would have been extremely relevant and emotional for the first audiences. As a modern viewer, it's not emotional in the same ways, because we are separated from the political conflict of entering WWII, but in the time period, even the cast was emotional during the singing of the national anthems.",Casablanca

Humphrey Bogart is still one of the best actors to ever grace American film, and from my experience rarely had a performance that was less than stellar. The dialogue is expertly written, and the camera work and lighting make the viewer feel like that they are almost there with the actors, feeling what they feel.

I'm not even a fan of B&W but this one shines. I don't know if it's because of the war (it was made in the middle of WWII) or Bogart or Claude Rains (the casting is perfect)but I cannot find anything wrong with this film. I especially like the searchlight effect that can be seen outside the windows. Peter Lorre, Sidney Greenstreet are excellent supporting cast members. The ambiance is so smooth.

By the third of the movie it makes you ponder who will go for who, for what, to go or stay to where and by the end you will linger why.This film makes you think about your own ""moral stance"" - to love or to the world; your self or selflessness. but c'mon, there's a war breaking out , is there a line needed to be drawn in front of you as to what is really important?It's a romance film so it's about LOVE, and she is such a fickle mistress; sometimes it leaves you but when it comes running back, it's a slippery slope to hike. Then you learn that if you really love someone you know how to let them go and ultimately move on because it's for the best. This film I believe is one of the first to showcase that. But overall it also varies to how much it relates to the viewer. I know I'm guilty. I would love to see colorized version but liked it anyhow.",Casablanca
840,deuchler,"Dooley Wilson as ""Sam""",10,14 February 2007,"Everyone knows the line ""Play it again, Sam,"" never really occurs in the picture. Bogart doesn't say those actual words to Dooley Wilson. ""Casablanca"" is widely recognized as a nearly perfect example of a film produced during the peak of the Hollywood ""Studio Years."" It's a cultural treasure and justifiably beloved. But there is no getting around the fact that the role of Sam, the jazz pianist, is patronizingly written and the character is an unfortunate example of the Uncle Tom type of ""good black"" that so often crept into movies of that era.The character of the pianist/singer in Rick's Cafe Americain was initially conceived of as a part for a female jazz artist like Hazel Scott, Ella Fitzgerald, or Lena Horne. Perhaps the subliminal sexuality of having a young African American woman so close to Rick (Bogart) made the Warner Bros. execs nervous. MGM, where Lena Horne was under contract, never quite knew how to deal with her beauty or sexuality. She was seldom part of a storyline but rather often featured as a performer in a nightclub sequence that could be snipped out in prints of the film being exhibited in the Deep South, thus not offending racists but not messing with the continuity of the plot. The role of the pianist was switched to a male character possibly to sidestep all the issues of miscegenation between the singer and ""Mr. Rick."" Racial mixing was one of the last taboos to go during the 30 year reign and enforcement of the Production Code.Though the Bogart character is respectful of Sam and looks out for his best interests, making sure Sam is paid the same once he leaves Morocco, their relationship is not truly one of equals. Sam always refers to him as ""Mr. Rick"" and Bergman as ""Miss Ilsa."" Sam takes care of Rick and worries over his happiness and well-being. We know nothing of Sam's life or needs. All we know for sure is that Sam will do anything he can to keep these white folks happy.When Bergman first spots Sam in the nightclub she inquires, ""Who is that boy playing the piano?"" BOY? Born in 1886, Dooley Wilson was 56 years old. Use of the term ""boy"" to refer to the musician is an unfortunate indication of the prevailing practice of denigrating black men's sexuality and maturity. One was a ""boy"" until one was 70.Yet Warner Bros., more-so perhaps than the other big studios, was more liberated in terms of race and its depiction. The mere presence of Sam as a character indicated progress to many. But the role is definitely narrow and restrained, within the typical submissive image often delineated for blacks. At one point, and mercifully it's mostly cut, early in the film Sam begins to sing an old song called ""Shine."" (Shine was a racist term for an African American, like Coon or Jigaboo.) The number was a very racist tune of the early 20th Century---""Just because my hair is curly/ Just because my teeth are pearly..."" We are not subjected to the full song which is a catalog of stereotypic images---and then the song ends with the line ""That's why they call me Shine."" The full number is sung by dancer John Bubbles in MGM's ""Cabin in the Sky"" filmed that same year.Dooley Wilson, by the way, was paid $350 per week to appear in ""Casablanca."" Sidney Greenstreet was paid $3,750 per week. Dooley Wilson was one of the best jazz drummers of the era. It's ironic that he will always be remembered ""playing piano"" (and not a very good faking, at that) in ""Casablanca."" He did also sing well, and his performance is part of the stuff dreams were made of at Warner Bros.---preserved for posterity in this wonderful though clearly not perfect film.",Casablanca
841,Keith937,Well Made,7,12 May 2016,"Casablanca is one of those classics were you don't have to say to much to convince someone that it is an amazing movie. This film is incredibly well made when it comes to its cinematography, set design, acting, direction and so much more. Now with all of this said you might be wondering why I gave it a 7 and the reason for this rating is its watchability and over all excitement for me. The movie is exciting and all but nothing that I would want to watch more then a few time a year and its just not something that I would recommend someone for an exciting weekend movie. This is a movie Id recommend watching at least once if you've never seen it before.",Casablanca
842,jcjacob-37009,The GREATEST American Film Ever Made!!!,10,28 March 2017,"Casablanca (1942), Directed by Michael Curtiz, is the film that still remains as a Great American Classic. The Acting (from Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman), as well as the Direction, Screen writing, Production, Editing, Cinematography, Musical Score and Art Direction/Set Decoration is all a Masterpiece of Cinematic Quality. There are techniques that Curtiz uses to pull off each and every scene, whether if it be the shadowing of Humphrey in one scene, or the usage of light for another scene with Ingrid. What is really striking about the film is how it holds up. The Filmmakers were in fact making another Hollywood Film, but in a different time.The Second World War broke out. American was uncertain about their future and what was to become of it. Some have said that this film is considered as a propaganda film; which is slightly true with most Hollywood films. the point is that Casablanca is masterful in every aspect. Its' black & White quality is another aspect.Michael Curtiz did a fantastic job with both casting, and art. He uses certain Camera and lighting tricks to get the audiences involved with the moment of each scene. What is interesting is that we don't know this, but critics do. The film has been sighted as a number one pick from critics. It is the film that reached the hearts of hundreds, if not thousands of people throughout the US.",Casablanca
843,yostwl,Perfection,10,14 May 1999,"They did everything right.  One of the few movies I can watch over and over again.  Bogart as macho, brave and vulnerable as any hero could hope to be, Bergman never more beautiful, the supporting cast all top-notch.  When they sing the Marseillaise in Rick's, I still get chills.  Love, patriotism, passion, heroism, cowardice, betrayal, loyalty, comic relief.  All done with excellence.",Casablanca
844,das-7,The Classic Romance Thriller,10,22 January 2001,"An exceptional ensemble cast, a richly textured script, and director Michael Curtiz's gift for observing rather than passing judgement upon the behaviour of ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances make Casablanca an outstanding film nearly a half century after its release. The film itself takes its tone from the Richard Blaine character with its deft blend of cynicism and engagement, ironic detachment and the dormant capacity to Believe. Coming as it did in the early years of the Second World War, when the outcome was far from certain, Casablanca stands as an astonishing act of bravado that offers a measure of hope without collapsing into propaganda slogans about the inevitability of victory. The particular ambiguity of the Vichy regime (that arresting opening, with the fleeing man shot under the the wall portrait of Marechal Petain proclaiming ""I keep not only my promises, but those of others"") is vividly captured in Casablanca, embodied in Capitaine Renault. The central romance has perhaps become a cliche in the eyes of modern viewers, because there have been so many parodies, reinterpretations, imitations. Yet there is something thrilling about a romance in which the carnality is implied rather than displayed in numbing (dare one say dull) detail, the easy way out taken by so many modern directors. Indeed, the most recent modern parallel to the plangent sexuality of Casablanca is the prison cell scene in Gladiator. Altogether a marvellous film of abiding quality, and just as a bonus, it offers the second-most blood-stirring version of the Marseillaise you will hear (first place is still claimed by Jessye Norman, draped in the French tricouleur, moving down the Champs Elysees, bringing tears to the soldiers of the honour guard during the bicentenary of the French Revolution).",Casablanca

Bogart has a presence in this movie that is unrivaled, and Bergman's angelic visage really adds to the magic of this movie.

The stars and moon were aligned in a way that made this movie one of the best of all time.",Casablanca

The actings were great by the whole cast, and teh piano musics and jazz make the cake even creamier.Well true defination of love I must say. well caught up storyline, a good ending and a smooth character development ;all comprised in the length of 1:30 hours of your life. it surely deserve to be on your ""movies you have to watch before you die"" list..

There are alot of visual metaphors and symbolism throughout as well.  Consider the fact that Bogart's character Rick represents the social and military isolationism of the US prior to the war and how he changes to making sacrifices for the good of the cause.  ""The lives of 2 human beings don't add up to a hill of beans"" so he gives her up for the greater good. That's Hollywood telling us that we need to sacrifice in our personal lives in order to fight for the greater good.

Casablanca is one of the very few movies that have succeeded in doing so.  Why that is so is a great mystery.  Maybe its the way everything blends together, maybe its the way it was all put together, maybe, maybe.  Analysing this is sometimes fruitless.  All one can say is that watching this movie over and over again makes us feel good!!!  Need one say more?",Casablanca
851,Cinemarker,Truly a Timeless Classic,10,11 March 2015,"Casablanca is a movie that most people hear about. A lot of Cartoons give a nod to it in some way, it has been parodied multiple times, and it has influenced numerous other films. Casablanca is a movie I had thought was always over-hyped and placed on a pedestal for no reason other than it being a ""classic"". After watching the film however I understand the hype. It is a timeless movie filled with romance, drama, and the occasional witty line. Bogart and Bergman have an electric chemistry and just look well together overall. Although they do not end up together in the end, Ilsa (Bergman) and Rick (Bogart) share a romance on screen that truly shows that ""if you love something set it free."" Rick risks it all to help the woman he once loved, and still probably does love. Aside from the romantic relationships, the friendship that binds Rick and Captain Louis Renault (Rains) appears genuine. They are two men who become entwined with due to unfortunate circumstances and what becomes of them after the film is something that I personally would like to know about.",Casablanca
852,adamfabbie,hof,8,6 April 2011,I am not much for romance films but the complex plot really kept you guessing until the very end.The lighting was the most beautiful I have seen especially on Ingrid Bergman she was always a bit brighter than everyone else and this really brought out her beauty and made her seem more elegant.I really liked the first scene in Rick's the lighting and focus kept you looking around the entire room even though you know what you were suppose to be focusing on.another great feature to this film was the music it was very elegant also and just added to that feel.,Casablanca

It was great to find out just how many people he really would help in times of need. The way he would let people win in roulette was great. Michael Curtiz did a great job of having the audience feel as though they were at Casablanca at the time, that was done by great acting as well as scenery necessary to get the job done. Ingrid Bergman did an excellent job as well, her facial expressions and the way she spoke, she fit the role perfectly. She had an innocent tone to her voice which created more of a dramatic sequence to every scene she was in, it gave the sad and happy pieces to the film an extra boost of emotion which was great.",Casablanca

Some of the scenes were so beautifully picturised and depicted, my most memorable scenes are the one when Ilsa comes back to the bar to see Rick and Rick says i have kept the first drink for you (or similar to that not exact dialogue of course). In that scene both have done well and so human. Rick behaved like a normal man who would have behaved the way he does in the movie, when you encounter your or meet your broken love.

This is, without a doubt, the most perfect movie ever made. The only criticism that might make any sense at all would be that when compared with modern films, it doesn't have great special effects. But then, it's not a ""special effects"" picture, and the cardboard cutout airplane with midgets working on it was a stroke of genius in itself.The story of the making of the movie that appears on the DVD is very interesting- the plot evolving during the shooting, writers coming and going and coming back again, the last minute (and beyond) work on the ending.The cast is outstanding, the sets are perfect, everything about this timeless classic works. Watching this film, to me, is an almost religious experience into the capabilities of the human species to use fiction to show the best and worst that we humans can be.

It did it's job in making you dislike the oppressive Nazi soldiers, and making you want Rick and Ilsa together; but as for holding my attention, it didn't do so. Watching Rick develop as a character was nice to see, as he was very monotone in the beginning and his feelings came up more and more by the end. The best part was the very end, where Rick shoots the German soldier and Renault lets him get away with it. The scene was put together smoothly and really made you like the characters.Another good compilation of scenes were the flashbacks between Rick and Ilsa. Rick's personality was completely different from that of the present. When he was stood up, it made you feel bad and then completely understand his cool composure through he rest of the film.

Second thing that impressed my eyes was the flashback when Humphrey Bogart had a memory back of Ingrid Bergman who promised to Bogart at the train station. ""Kiss me more than the last time"" such words spark Ingrid and makes Bogart to in-love with her. Third things involve my attention is work of artistic of lights was amazing and looks realistic. Afterwards film director Michael Curtiz and Cinematography Arthur Edeson they create an attractive shots and scene setting. Eventually camera motion panning, tilt up and down search a wonderful work. Last but not least ""Ricks Cafe Americana"" its all about open your eyes people can still out of your pocket while you up, honestly that's how Casablanca even today you should be careful when walking on the street some can still from your pocket.

As noted in another comment, Casablanca remains as complex, funny, romantic, and full of suspense as it did when it first graced the silver screen nearly 60 years ago. I recommend it often, and rarely do my friends not thoroughly enjoy the film, despite the fact that most of my friends and I were not born until 35 years after it was written. Those few that didn't like it simply don't like anything in black and white, which is their loss I suppose (the colorized version, to be frank, sucks). In short, if you enjoy movies and can stand B&W, then you should watch this film. Even if you don't like most B&W films you should watch it; odds are you'll like this one.",Casablanca

Pro war, pro allies, anti Nazi, even a little anti French, this movie was made smack in the middle of WWII when the outcome was still in doubt and designed get the public behind the war effort.  It sure was more fun then those 'Victory gardens, paper drives and gas rationing' and other techniques to get public support.

At the end, when Bogie gives up Bergman for the sake of the war, I was just completely stunned. Movies were allowed to end that way?

The cinematography in this film is genius, as the filmmakers used creative and innovative techniques to capture the mood of the story. The use of light, but moreover, the use of darkness in this film is beautiful. The shadows in the scenes represented the hardships the characters were facing, while the characters shown in the light displays there is nothing to be unsure of. Laszlo is a character that is not shown in the dark, and that represents him as a character. Meanwhile, Rick is often shown in the casted shadows while he is facing internal hardships, struggling to act for himself or for the greater good. Much like Rick, America was in a period of isolationism before joining WW2, and the audience watched the war unfold on the screen, while being unsure of how it would turn out in real life.

871,TheInvisibleCar,Still the greatest movie of all time!!!,10,21 June 2007,"Casablanca is still the greatest movie of all time! Its stars shine, there are memorable lines, quite a few which have been repeated elsewhere or even become the titles of movies themselves, there is superbly artistic and notable cinematography, heartfelt romance, inspiring and touching music, heroes, swelling feelings of sentiment and patriotism, and it is in no way too long, too weird or different. Just an all around great movie, and even for the few of those who can't agree that Casablanca is the all-around greatest movie of all time, they perhaps would at least agree that it has all the elements and plenty enough of what it takes to be putting up an honorable fight to claim that top spot, and most definitely should be on any critic's short list of greatest movies, if they expect to really be taken seriously. .Time seems to date some movies badly, while it has worked greatly in favor of some movies, like Casablanca. It was made in the day when color was rare, yet, used black in white so well that it seems to be a great example of a movie that should have been filmed in black and white, even if doing such were to have cost more than color. The false looking backgrounds in its Paris automobile scenes in particular, although perhaps not so intended, has actually been used as a purposeful technique of dreamy recollection and such, in a few more modern day films. And again, even though perhaps not intended at the time, and even though the entire movie was made in studio, the fact that the Paris scenes are the ones that look so particularly fake is appropriate, since, at that very time, those scenes had to be fake, as Paris wasn't available, because it was under German occupation. There is no understating that this movie was a part of the arsenal of democracy itself, its story, themes and passion are set in the very center of what was then the raging battle for the world in what would become the single most defining event of the 20th Century, World War II. Every actor in the film, the director, the producer, and anybody and everybody working on the film or in any way involved with its making, were, in fact, at war with Nazi Germany. There is no need for a learned critic or professor to explain this or anything about the movie, anything about its producers having used some new technique, some new technology, or any particularly notable new style of cinematography to just enjoy Casablanca. It's very touching in its story of human relationships and it is so noted for its black and white cinematography that some of its most ardent fans consider any colorizations of it sacrilege, even among those of us not generally opposed to the idea of colorization. And, it is the story of its times. Its depiction of challenged French patriotism brings tears the eyes of many a repeat viewer time and time again, when The Marseilles is sung. There are lines that people repeat, songs that even today people sing and whistle. In terms of just all around sheer entertainment, the movie is petty much as good as it gets. It is not only difficult to come up with a suggestion of what movies of the 20th century could be considered as good, it's impossible to find any movie that has anywhere near as many people thinking of it as the greatest movie of the 20th century. It's as if a clear majority think it the greatest movie of all time, and as for what other movie is even a contender to Casablanca's claim to the title, well, there is no clear single contender. I doubt fans of Casablanca could even form a majority as to what the second greatest movie of all time is. Even if all those who have another movie in mind could have a run-off to determine their party's candidate, it wouldn't matter, as Casablanca already has 65% of the general electorate locked-up. Although all-time is far from over, it's safe to say that Casablanca is now the for-all-time greatest movie of the 20th Century. Its as if Indiana Jones was involved in some battle, in the middle of some war, that we were actually passionately involved in at the time, with our entire economy geared towards the goal of winning that war, against actual Nazis soldiers, rather than the theatrical Nazi-ish soldiers that Indiana Jones was having problems with. Except Casablanca's actors are legendary movie icons. The dialogue is superior. The musical score is among the best of movies, as memorable as even the best of musicals, only Casablanca isn't a musical. Just as the main song of the movie is about a fight for love and glory, exactly what the entire free western and allied world was engaged in at that time, so the viewer feels where they stand in their heart of hearts. The viewer relates to the characters, and anybody familiar with history who believes in freedom and democracy isn't just cheering for our characters in the end, we truly feel as if we are on their side! Had the allied battle been lost, Casablanca may very well have quickly become a controlled, discarded and forgotten piece of illicit war propaganda. But as things turned out, it's Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, along with Dooley Wilson, Paul Henreid, Claude Rains and many others, starring in the greatest roles of their careers in what clearly still seems to be the greatest movie of all time. Casablanca's being part of the patriotic effort itself, is perhaps one of its greatest advantages in cementing its claim as the greatest movie of all time, and this is a concrete advantage that will only continue to strengthen and harden, ""As Time Goes By.""",Casablanca
872,m-elmardi,Casablanca,8,12 March 2021,"Casablanca is an outstanding film. It brought suspense, different moods, love, and action. The movie was smartly directed.

873,Mr_White101,The greatest..,10,31 May 2007,"Casablanca (written December, 2006)Has there ever been more chemistry on screen than Bogart and Bergman? Has there ever been more individual character development in a single film than this? Has there ever been a Hollywood classic quite like Casablanca? This is cinema at it's very best, for all the reasons within the questions, and for a thousand other qualities; the luscious setting, the forever- memorable quotes, the beautiful cinematography and the timeless plot, its class, its intrigue, its legend and its, to name a few! Micheal Curtiz's Casablanca is sensational- it'll have you playing it again, and again, and again!",Casablanca
874,pdeeley2006,My review,10,21 January 2007,"Casablanca (1942) Michael CurtizIn a bar fight, I'll take Rick Blaine as my wing man any day. Casablanca's leading character played by Humphrey Bogart is the stud I have always wanted to be. He is measured in his action, passionate without being strident, and his principled actions are imbued with tremendous courage. Even approaching the least savory of actions, the better angels of his nature win the battle.Moreover, any man that can pretend to let Ingrid Bergman out of his sight is beyond my comprehension (I would have given the Oscar for that alone). There are only a few characters that I really which I was as cool as (not that I am cool to any degree right now); Rick Blaine is the alpha dog of that imaginary group.The moral universe of Casablanca is one that I want to inhabit. The spirit of the law is adhered to, rather than the letter. Truth is valued over accuracy. And people seek to treat each other with respect and love that exceeds there own need to be comfortable.If Casablanca is new to you, I think you will find it easy to watch and surprisingly contemporary in its editing. You'll likely learn where some of our cultures clichés come from (he never does actually say ""Play it again Sam"" and now you'll know where Bryan Singer got the title The Usual Suspects). In short, Casablanca is mandatory viewing for cultural citizenship in our beloved country.MySpace.com/200WordCritic",Casablanca
875,Django44,Still stands up well,10,20 April 2003,"This is a true classic where every aspect shines, but notably the amazing script and performances (especially of Bogart and Claude Rains). It still stands up as perfect entertainment, and the ending is very memorable. Admittedly, it might not be entirely to everyone's taste, but you can't fault it on any level.",Casablanca
876,dbohr,Best Romance ever,10,24 July 2002,"Bogart and Bergman should be the standard by how all romances on film are judged.  Casablanca shows them at those heady early days of a romance, the tragic separation, the awkward second encounter, and the compelling story of how they resolve those feelings still inside.Henreid should not be forgotten.  His style sets up an interesting contrast to the more gruff Bogart.Rains gives a little comic relief to the film, and also contributes a great deal to the other side of this story: the onset of WWII.  His uncertainty of how much to follow Germany, and whether or not to go against the Nazis, was similar to how many Europeans at the time felt.  His ultimate decision at the end also makes this a great movie.The final ten minutes of this film is some of the best work ever done in any movie.

880,Rsacto,A classic wartime/noir pic & entertaining as-all-get-out despite the bad casting of the romantic leads,8,6 October 2016,"I still enjoy watching Casablanca, mainly for the snappy, rapier-wit dialogue written by the amazing Epstein brothers in the first half of pic. Peter Lorre's lines as ""Ugarte"" with Bogart never fail to get a laugh out of audiences: ""You despise me, don't you?"" Bogart: ""Well, if I gave you any thought I probably would."" Truly scintillating script-writing.I love watching the supporting cast members in Rick's ""Cafe Americain"" who have been indisputably reported as refugees who had actually fled Nazi-occupied Europe. When they sang ""La Marseillaise,"" the tears in their eyes were the real thing. Pretty hard to top that, especially in a film made during the early days of WWII. Unfortunately, the Epsteins were given another writing assignment halfway through pic, and Howard Koch was ordered to crank out the melodramatic denouement of the yet unfinished script, written just days ahead of the actual shoot. Madeleine LeBeau (featured in a brief dalliance with Bogart's Rick in pic) is easily the sexiest woman in pic (at 17 years of age, a recent French refugee herself, and quintessentially nubile). She genuinely cries like a baby as she sings her French national anthem. Few actresses ever upstaged the polished super-star Ingrid Bergman, with the extreme close-ups of her carefully posed, glowing, porcelain complexion lighting up any theater screening pic. But the slinky, succulent, petit morceau LeBeau (who was the one player, besides Claude Rains, who exuded any genuine sexual energy in pic) still managed to steal the limelight in her small, supporting role.Bogart struts and grunts through pic with the same tough guy persona he uses in every gangster film he's ever been in. Imagine instead the witty and urbane Dick Powell (who breathed life into the very same ""Phillip Marlowe"" character in ""Murder, My Sweet"" that Bogart couldn't even touch in his portrayal of that private-eye in ""The Big Sleep"") as Rick, instead of the grumpy, unappealing Bogart. Powell was a former song-and-dance man who seamlessly transitioned over to dramatic roles, and he would have given a nuanced, heartfelt perf to the character of Rick. Perhaps he was unavailable, but he's the actor I would have cast as Rick. Ingrid Bergman herself seems like she hasn't the slightest sexual interest in the aging, sawed-off Bogart. She also mailed in her scenes with her husband Paul Henreid, who acts as stiff as a board with Bergman, though at 6' 3"" Henreid at least didn't have to stand on an ""Apple Box"" (derisively known in The Biz as ""The Man-Maker"" in snarky filmmaking jargon) like the 5' 8"" Bogart was forced to use in order to match the the height of the towering Swede Bergman's 5' 10"" (without heels) stature. Bergman, obviously a sophisticated, blase', 30ish-looking woman, looks so far out of Bogart's league that it's almost laughable. Cary Grant was the only male lead to really ignite an on-screen chemistry in his roles with The Viking Queen.Predictably, the stuffy, classically-trained, over-rehearsed Bergman didn't have a clue on how to umpire Claude Rains' constant flirtations with her. Improv was never Bergman's strong suit. The ever-playful Rains stole every scene with Bergman, who turned out to be an odd, dour casting choice indeed for the role of the young, naive woman who was Bogart's young Paris squeeze. Worst of all, Bergman's crassly imperious and unmistakably condescending air in her dialogue with Sam, Bogart's black piano player, revealed her revoltingly supercilious sense of Nordic superiority. The fiery, spectacular Parisienne Madeleine LeBeau would have been a much more believable and tantalizing choice for the ""impressionable young girl"" that the worldly, independent Scandinavian Bergman ridiculously claimed to be when she fell for and married Henreid's heroic resistance-fighter character. If only the story had flashbacked to Bogart in his earlier Paris romance with the mouthwatering, patently underage LeBeau, maybe it would have infused pic with the Hays Code-busting, steamy sexual energy that it needed to propel it above its predictable, corny, propaganda-infused climax. Kind of like what Bogart actually did in his real life, when he gave his much older wife Mayo Methot the heave-ho to marry the beautiful 19 year-old Hollywood MAW (""Model-Actress-Whatever"") named Lauren Bacall, who was an eye-popping twenty-five years his junior (they were enviously referred to in 1940s Tinseltown as ""Bogey & Baby""). Life imitates art.""We'll always have Paris,"" Bogart pontificates to Bergman as he stoically gives her up to Henreid in the last scene, who then both escape Casablanca to Lisbon by plane. Seriously?! Even a whiskey-soaked, man's-man like Rick would have shot Henreid's character dead in the blink of an eye to hang on to the stunning - if icy and unapproachable - Bergman.The saccharine Hollywood Ending with Bogart walking off with Claude Rains with their backs to us into the fog (actually a darkened sound stage at Warner Brothers Culver City lot), with Rains offering to use the 10,000 francs he lost in a bet with Bogart to get them both to safety of the Free French garrison at Brazzaville, has become the most quoted line in pic: ""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship."" That mawkish, syrupy line - written by none other than pic's producer Hal B. Wallis himself - ran neck-and-neck for the final looped line in pic with the much more cynical, and entertaining, alternative line that he wrote: ""Louis, I always knew that you had a little larceny in your heart,"" but that line was finally considered too unpatriotic for a wartime propaganda pic.",Casablanca
881,ssparling,A timeless classic and one of the great films of all time.,10,1 January 2004,"Shot as just another film in the days when Hollywood was pumping out movies like an assembly line.  Indeed, the film is not shot as an epic with sweeping scenes of battles or with elaborate sets or special effects.  So why all the fuss?This film has grown in stature because of the brilliant acting of the two lead characters, the remarkably witty and clever dialogue, and the war-torn romance that is the heart of the picture.  In other words, it is an actor-driven film with a terrific script and a story about love, war, and politics, i.e., a formula for a masterpiece.Put simply, Ingrid Bergman is electric in this film.  She is stunningly beautiful and turns in a remarkable performance as the brave and sensual Ilsa.  Her facial expressions alone convey more than most actresses can do with monologues.  She convincingly plays a young women torn between her ideals and affection for her husband-mentor and her passion for Rick, the one true love of her life.Not to be outdone, Bogart's performance is probably the strongest of his career.  He simultaneously manages to play a self-absorbed sulking saloon keeper, passionate lover, and sentimental patriot.  Rick is a complex and deep character, deeply wounded by Ilsa's choice to leave him at a train station in Paris to tend to her once forsaken husband.On top of this passionate romance, the film is paced by its political subplot, which is all the more interesting since it was filmed during World War II.  The script deftly weaves jabs at the Nazis and packs political themes throughout.  Moreover, the superb script conveys complex character interactions and messages without hitting the viewer over the head with explanation or narration.  Nowhere is this more apparent than in the underlying negotiating between Captain Renault and Rick on a variety of topics throughout the film.Bolstering the performances of Bogart and Bergman is the heady acting of Henreid and Rains.  Indeed, Rains' performance as Captain Renault is one of the great buddy-womanizer roles of all-time.  He is simultaneously charming and without conviction.  Henreid delivers a terrific performances as the political icon Victor Laszlo.  He is both dashing and courageous without ever trying to overshadow Bogart.This is a great film that gets better each time you see it.",Casablanca
882,cppc4549,This film has badly aged,4,8 July 2004,"This film appears to have badly aged. Old sentimental and patriotic rhetoric about the ""tough guy with tender heart"", helpless woman who ""suffers"" because she's torn between two lovers, manichean vision of the good (Americans), rather lost (French collaborators), and bad (the Germans) guys. Even Titanic seemed much more convincing. And why is it that Humphrey Bogart is supposed to be such a seductive legend? I find him dull and devoid of expression, much less empathy. I think the demographic breakdown of the vote on Casablanca explain in part the basis for the enthusiasm: most positive have been old-age men.

This film had great acting from both the main and supporting actors who really seemed to give it there all to portray these characters perfectly but that was the only part of this movie that really blew me away.

If you have not seen it you are in for a real treat when you do. Bogart portrays a real pathos here that has been unsurpassed.  Ingrid Bergman as the woman torn between the two men she loves will tug at your heartstrings.  Some of Bogie's most famous lines are in this movie (i.e. Renaud; ""So Ricky why did you come to Casablanca?""  Rick: ""My health.  I came for the waters.""  Renaud: ""But Casablanca is in the middle of the desert.""  Rick: (In a very non chalant tone), ""I was misinformed."")  This movie has everything; comedy, drama, romance, and tragedy.

Yet for all its great dialogue and wonderful characterization, the script to 'Casablanca' was only half finished when production started!  The final thirty minutes were being written an hour before they were shot.But 'Casablanca' comes off looking anything but rushed.  The acting shines from start to finish.  The camera work progresses from normal shots in the beginning, to close-ups that fill the screen near the end.  And let's not forget symbolism; A Free-French soldier being shot down in front of DeGaul's poster; and the characters, who mirror the European half of World War II.'Casablanca' is not artistic.  There are no fancy angles, weird-beard lighting effects, or enigmatic scenes.  'Casablanca' is not artistic because it does not need to be.

It has a rugged, square-jawed hero, bad guys (not just Nazis, but the French who would betray their own country to the Nazis), a pretty girl (very pretty), exotic locales, and lines that everyone can recite, a la Rocky Horror Picture Show. Lots of fun. However, the fact that this is on the IMDB top 250 is sad. There are at least 250 films better than it (notice I say ""better than"" not ""that I like more,"" nor ""that you like more""). Degustibus non disputandus est. I will grant that. However, art has tougher criteria than ""I like it, and my opinion counts because I am Me!"" Casablanca is a disjointed muddle of a film. It is cliche ridden, as subtle as a ton of dynamite, and does not come close to true masterpieces of film art. Want to see a good wartime film with good heros and bad villains? See Rome, Open City or La Notte di San Lorenzo.For a better, deeper critique of what is wrong with this film, I suggest reading Umberto Eco's essay on it.

It is just another shallow, formulaic, cliche-laden Hollywood love-story, typical of pre-war Hollywood. For me this film is almost undistinguishable from that other 'great' romance of the time, the nauseating 'Gone With the Wind'. At least Casablanca doesn't go on for several hours. The usual plot of old lovers reunited after many years, once again in some Hollywood interpretation of a gratuitous exotic location. Bogart looks depressed, Bergman looks pretty. And that's about all there is to it. No depth of thought or character. Flat, commercial acting from the leads, even flatter and more commercial direction and script. If you like old movies from the 40s, why not watch Citizen Kane? There's considerably more thought and originality there.And I've never understood why people think the lines ""Here's looking at you kid"" or ""Play it again, Sam"" are *so* quotably witty.",Casablanca
893,cldavisj,Casablanca at 60,10,28 January 2002,"With the possible, arguable, exception of Citizen Kane, this is THE finest piece of celluloid ever to exist. I give it a notch over Kane because it has the romantic interest of Bergman and Bogey (Elsa and Rick) as a second powerful sub-plot. The casting is perfect, the story is exciting, supporting characters have (in the ensuing 6 decades) become as memorable and important as the leads. If you buy DVD's, get this one or Kane first. These films will be the basis on which to compare all others that have come before or after. If they are dated..well then so be it. Great stories transcend time (how many remakes of Romeo & Juliet exist for example?) and Casablanca is such.The multiple tales of human folly, fear, death, hate, love and living for a higher purpose are seamlessly integrated into a hundred-odd minutes of magical story telling. Will anyone make a film like this again? No...that would be impossible. Perhaps come close but never exceed this perfect example of the motion picture arts. And art it is. If it were a painting it would hang in the Louvre, if a song, comparable with Beethoven's 9th, if a book, it would be on the shelf next to Shakespear's First Folio. Enough...see the movie...again.

I researched her career after I finished the film and learned she's tied with Meryl Streep as one of the most Oscar awarded actresses in history.

895,gordonriot,As time goes by...,10,6 June 2003,"...this remains one of the very best films ever made. Whether or not it is *the* best is open to debate, but it's easily top ten.Humphrey Bogart gives the performance of a lifetime - understated yet full of passion and rage simmering under the surface. At first we only see the hard-headed side of him but it isn't long before the artifice starts to crumble and we see the romantic idealist coming through. We realise that the cool, emotionless exterior is really a mechanism for self-protection - protection from the hurt of his own past, but also protecting him from the Nazis, who would probably kill him if they knew where his true sympathies lie.In the end, he becomes a true hero - sacrificing his own desires for the woman he loves and risking his life to help the Resistance cause. And all the way through, Bogart's acting shows remarkable restraint - it would have been all too easy to play it like Jimmy Dean in Rebel Without A Cause or Marlon Brando in On The Waterfront, but while he is just as much of a free spirit as those young hotheads, Rick Blaine is a man of immense wisdom and experience.On top of all this, we have one of the most memorable scripts Hollywood has ever produced - there's a classic line in every scene. The film also has plenty of humour, and some great characters played by some great actors. Claude Rains is wonderful - he plays his part with a light touch so you can't hate him despite his apparently treacherous exterior, though it only really becomes apparent in his actions in the closing scene that, like Rick, his collusion is mostly an act of self-preservation.At under 100 minutes, the film manages to cram an awful lot in to a very neat package - there is no padding at all, every second is made to count, and that's one of the reasons why you can never tire of watching it over and over again.In short, there is nothing to fault with this film. It's perfect.",Casablanca

It is not about living in a foreign land and not knowing if you will ever get to a better place. It is also not necessarily a love story, at least not in the sense that it is about whether or not to people will fall in love and end happily ever after. At it's core Casablanca is about the effect that two people can have on each other and what effect the crossing of two paths can do. In almost every conceivable way Casablanca was one of the best technical cinematic works ever made. Every shot was elegant and extremely thought out. Weather it was a scene with one person in a dark room or a crowded street in the bright of day, nothing is out of place. Nothing is over or under done. While the story is well done it is also, in a way, boiler plated. I don't mean to say this negatively, rather as a complement to how timeless this story truly is. It could conceivably happen anywhere or any time in history.

I was in love with the movies from then on. Oh, sure, I'd gone to the drive-in in rural Alabama and had seen various movies. But I had been too young and immature to really appreciate them for what they were. But when my uncle took me to see Raiders, I was hooked. For years, I considered Spielberg's masterpiece to be the best movie ever made. But then I happened to get hold of a VHS copy of Casablanca and checked it out. WOW! Moviemaking had been redefined for me. This movie has it all. Bogart is such an incredible presence. I think Harrison Ford is our modern-day answer to Bogart.

Epstein and Philip G. Epstein and Howard Koch is excellent, without a boring section in it. It develops the characters beautifully as the story progresses.Michael Curtiz's direction is 100 percent. Curtiz knew just how much importance to give each scene, all the while keeping the ""romance"" part of the movie at the forefront.The acting is perfect. Although I've heard of many actors being up for the part, I can't think of anyone being better suited for the male lead than Humphrey Bogart. Ingrid Bergman is just beautiful. She doesn't need to do much, because her eyes are so expressive.The supporting cast consists of great actors, including Claude Rains.Here is a movie that didn't have any elements of action or sex or real violence, or any of the benefits of digital effects, yet it shines masterfully.It's no wonder that Casablanca has made it on most critic's top ten lists.",Casablanca

The acting for both Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are impeccable! Especially Ingrid! I really like her performance! Also, the cinematography is undeniably top notch consider it was filmed in the 1940s! Additional bonus is the music chosen were GREAT! I can go on and on.. but cut the long stories short, you are definitely watching it for a treat!I rarely give 10/10 for a movie. My collection of a 10/10 movie might not be flawless. But to me I will re-watch it again and again. Casablanca definitely belongs to that league. After watching Casablanca, I shall shift my priority from contemporary Drama/Romance to classical Hollywood. Damn! This movie made the current Drame genre look like crap!P.S. This is the oldest movie I have watched in my life so far.",Casablanca
904,hitzendegen,"War Propaganda or a ""B"" Movie ? Or Both ?",4,30 November 2011,"This is pure War Propaganda in disguise of a ""B"" movie, and as it happens with every politicization of art, it ages quicker. Not that Casablanca has too much to age though, as a film released as a somewhat vulgar piece. The scenarios are cheesy, to which my guess is they didn't have time nor money to elaborate on that. The acting from the two main characters, portrayed by Bogard and Bergson are weak at best. He has basically two face expressions, and switch from number 1 to number 2 when so circumstances dictate.The two thumbnails to the trailers happen to show both. She doesn't glance that much neither. The close ups are there to highlight that, maybe. Saying more on Bogard, he is his predictable tough shell with a moral inner core, which in this particular case means to oppose the bad German guys. Not very inventive. The French Captain Renault (Claude Rains) is another painful figure to watch, an ugly caricature with a ludicrous accent, and his acting you can't buy as with most of these stagy-level-performance actors. One can save but one. Ugarte (Peter Lorre) is real amid fakes. And still on what brings this movie from a ""0″ to a generous ""4″. I save ones and twos for disasters and this isn't one. It is more a case of sketchy story-telling, with lowsy characters. What saves it from being ""3″ is the presence of some good camera angles, which in comparison to what had been done at the time in terms of US productions are quite innovative. And maybe on its release date it might have had some appeal, saying something like ""let's kick some Nazi asses"". It is an attempt at being glamorous as well; ill-faded completely nevertheless. Besides that, very little to offer with the pathetic ""Here's is looking at you, kid"".The last sequence, the airplane one, sums it up.Poor acting, poor Drama, cheesy carton airplane to end up an excuse of a classic. People are afraid of actually watching it and being critical, thus regarded as ignorant film-wise and hence the many 10 out of 10 reviews. It's easier to go with the flow ! with the bunch. However I tried, I can't. Casablanca is so lame! 4 out of 10 (could well be 3.5)",Casablanca
905,IronBob,More than a classic,10,25 December 2008,"There's one aspect of Casablanca that is seldom if ever discussed. Every character in the movie has made choices out of necessity rather than desire and yet the entire movie centers around desire.Humphrey Bogart's, Rick, settles in Casablanca after being on the run with Sam, his piano man who has very little choice but to follow him. Bergman's, Ilsa, who is torn from Bogart in Paris, leaves him out of necessity when she learns her husband who she thought was dead is alive.Ilsa's husband played by Paul Henreid, is a non-reluctant political mercenary, taking refuge in Casablanca.In the background there is Louie, the French prefect, who also by necessity plays the aggressive supporter of Vichy France and yet has no love for his superiors.In the background is the oppressiveness of the German army in a town where every non-native is there out of necessity, trying to free themselves from the yoke of German viciousness.Thus is the backdrop where desire must heed to necessity against a menace out to crush both. A truly remarkable film with remarkable performances that have gone on to be more than a timeless classic but rather a thread in the fabric of every American. It carries messages that may seem lost on today's youth but still provides timeless lessons.",Casablanca
906,gohlson,One of the best movies ever made,10,4 August 2005,"This is one of the best movies of all time. Anyone who claims to be a fan of the movies needs to see this film. The story, ostensibly about people fleeing the nazi's in World War Two could be set anywhere there are refugees today. There are oppressors, people seeking a better life, those that prey on them and the cynical ones that float with the tides. The whole range of human emotions and activities are seen in this movie. Bogie was never better than he was as Rick, the owner of a cafe in Casablanca where the refugees hang out gambling and drinking and waiting for their chance to leave. Ingrid Bergman was never better than she was as Ilsa Lund, Rick's former lover and husband of resistance leader Victor Lazlo(Paul Henreid). The interplay between Bogie and Bergman would make this film one of the best. But there's more. The ensemble cast includes some of the best character actors together in one film. Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet put in strong performances(albeit brief ones) as those who prey on the refugees. Claude Raines, the chief of police, is the perfect bureaucrat who rolls with the tides supporting whoever is on top and knowing it will change. While Bogie never did say 'here's looking at you, kid,"", Raines did say ""round up the usual suspects.""I won't spoil the ending, but if you're not crying because of Bogie's nobility and Bergmans pure love for both Rick and her husband, you're not human.

I was very surprised to find out this film is a romance. However the movie did not disappoint me what so ever. I was amazed to discover what a wonder this movie is. I loved this movie in so many ways. The acting isn't the best however the dialog makes up for it completely. As well as the expertly written comedic aspect to the film:Gentleman ""I'm shocked... shocked to find out that gambling is going on in here!""(Man walks over and declares that the gentleman has one)Gentleman: ""Thank you very much.""This is one of my favourite films of all time and if you have seen it I'm sure you could understand why.

This film is flawless, with more memorable quotes, just as Don G. has 10 or more top of the line arias. Virtually every scene is a classic, especially the scenes where Bogart allows Henreid to drown out the Nazis with the French anthem, and the last scene. Dooley Wilson as Sam is Bogart's conscience, sort of like Jiminy Cricket. Claude Rains is wonderful as usual. He should have won at least 10 Supporting Actor Oscars, but especially here, as the collaborator who becomes a patriot. Likewise, Madeline LeBeau is great in a small role as the girl spurned by Bogart, then she dallies with the Nazis, but when Henried leads the Marseillese, she remembers what it means to be French.",Casablanca
910,david-nobes,My all time favourite,10,2 May 2009,"This is far and away my favourite movie of all time. I first saw it on some TV Sunday matinée when I was a teenager, and instantly fell in love with Ingrid Bergman.The movie appears to be filled with clichés, BUT many of those clichés originated from this film. The dialogue is snappy, the characters are wonderfully scripted, and even the minor characters help make this a memorable experience. This was helped at the time by the casting of many refugee artists in minor roles, including the extras in the street scenes.There is no scene wasted, no unnecessary aspects to the story-telling. The lighting is atmospheric when it needs to be. And the ending ... well, I won't spoil it, but it became an instant classic.",Casablanca
911,tonyp-76178,The acting or the cinematography?,9,20 October 2018,"I can not tell what it is that made this movie so good. Was it the smoke filled rooms barely lit, and the strategic lighting used to build the mood, or was it the great performance by Humphrey Bogart. Every scene seems like it was deliberately thought out where every piece of light and every extra sound would come in to form a perfect setting. Also the casting seemed perfect for the movie where if someone else had played any of the main characters the movie would not have had the same feeling as it does now. I think everything together made this movie as good as it is.",Casablanca
912,yasxrk,Cinema at its finest,9,7 February 2019,"Gone with the Wind, Citizen Kane,Brief Encounter and Rebel Without a Cause. All of these films are classics,but I don't think any of them can topple the legacy and transcendent beauty of the masterpiece that is Casablanca.
The terrific script works unbelievably well with Humphrey Bogart's character Rick, as he moves through life with cynicism and sarcasm. ""I don't stick my neck out for everybody""sums up the Rick we meet in the first quarter of the film.He is courteous to his customers,but for a mysterious reason he is only really concerned about himself and doesn't seem worried about others.Then,our queries are answered.Ingrid Bergman arrives,and it is then we understand the true reason behind Rick's underlying sadness and cynicism.As the film progresses,the audience experiences some of the best on screen chemistry ever seen;Bergman and Bogart are incredible together,in the few scenes they share,their emotions and love for each other is reflected extraordinary by the actors. The fantastic script merges in with their characters so well,as they toy and wonder where their love will take them. The supporting cast of Paul Henreid,Claude Rains and Peter Lorre provide terrific performances to shine with the two co-stars.Now,the ending. Most romance films often end with a conventional happy ending.Michael Curtiz and the Epsteins gave us so much more. As we hoped for Rick and Isla to reunite,Rick's sacrifice in the airport unfolded, and we realised that the ending is not so gloomy after. Rick's sacrifice of letting Isla go with Victor,was undeniably heartbreaking for Rick,yet his sacrifice to do the moral thing for the right cause internally left him redeemed and ultimately content that he did the right thing for his nation. The screenplay in this film is so magnificently woven together with the performances of the actors,iconic dialogue and soundtrack,that it firmly distinguishes itself as the greatest romance film that has graced our screens. It is simply the epitome of great cinema, a preeminent work that is perhaps the most phenomenal film to come out of the Golden Age of Hollywood.",Casablanca
913,lapointeolivier,Classic. Enough Said,9,2 January 2019,"If there is a more 'classic' film from the golden age of Hollywood, I'm not sure I know of it.

914,kentig,My favorite movie of all time,10,26 June 1999,"Casablanca combines an unforgettable romantic story with the harsh reality of war & danger.  Set in the city of the film's title, we have Rick Blaine, an American running from something (&/or someone), who owns a nightclub in Casablanca, where the Nazi's have taken over.  When Ilsa walks into the nightclub one night, we soon learn that they were lovers in Paris a few years earlier.  When the Germans march into France, Rick & Ilsa are to leave.  Ilsa never shows up at the train station, & Rick is forced to leave without her.  Rick's character in the present is a tortured soul, who is seemingly going thru the motions, looking for a reason to go on, or for a cause worth fighting for.  By the end of the movie, we find that, by doing the noble thing, it not only gives him the impetus to reconstruct his life once again, but also conveys a powerful message to those of us in the audeince, that message being that while you can physically lose the love of your life, spiritually, she will always be with you. The movie has just the right amount of intrigue, romance, and humor to make it the most unforgettable story ever put on the Silver Screen.  All of the characters, major and minor, are perfect in their roles.  Humphrey Bogart's portrayal of Rick has left an indelible mark on his entire career & life. Ingrid Bergman - Oh, those wet & hypnotic eyes at the climactic end. Claude Raines as Louie adds just the right touch of cynicism & change of pace humor.  Paul Henreid's Victor Laslo inflicts the needed patriotism into the film.  As a matter of fact, both Rick's & Victor's unyielding love for Ilsa is so genuine, that the ending, where Victor goes off with Ilsa, seems so right, as though there shouldn't be any losers in this ""game"".  The evilness of Major Strasser adds the right tone. Casablanca - an all time classic.",Casablanca
915,emerson-12,It had everything...,10,28 November 1999,"I'll be brief.  Casablanca is probably one of my favorite movies.  It has romance, intrigue, a cast of interesting characters, good guys, bad guys, moral choices, and classic quotes.  In other words, it had everything. While many movies (especially more recent films) have all this and more, Casablanca holds a special place in my heart.  So, as you watch, think of the film more as a symbol rather than trying to compare it to other great films. Casablanca stands alone.",Casablanca
916,chih_wei,"Great movie, but not the greatest",8,16 December 2000,"Casablanca is a great movie with strong acting and script.  But I don't think it's THE best or top 10 movies of all time. I haven't seen that many classics, but in comparison, it lacks the complexity and inventiveness of Citizen Kane.  Gone With the Wind, as melodramatic as it is, has astounding cinematography/sets, strong performances and 2 memorable characters instead of 1 (i.e. Rick.  Ilsa and Victor are rather 1-dimensional, the script's fault, not acting).  With the same strong ensemble performance, All About Eve's wittiness would blow Casablanca's script away.Of course, Casablanca is a nice package of romance, suspense and action, but it is not without its flaws.  The Paris scenes felt subpar and corny to the rest of the movie.  Besides, Rick already seems cynical back in Paris.  So it hinders the supposed transformation after Ilsa left him.  As mentioned above, Ilsa and Victor are bland characters.  Louis' transformation in the end is incredulous.  The plot is predictable.  Can't you see it coming that Rick still has a golden heart, that Victor & Ilsa would escape Casablanca, that even the bad Nazi gets what he deserved.  All in all, it feels more ""black and white"" and dated than other classics, and it's not just because the movie is set during WW2.",Casablanca

I believed Rick and Ilse and Victor were caught in a terrible love triangle.

But that was about it.  I saw it again when I was 19 years old and this time it blew me away.  The performances, the writing, the cinematography, the direction, and the music all seemed perfect.  I watched one more time a little later to confirm that this might be one of the best films ever, and I liked it even more.  I can't necessarily give specifics, but maybe it's the chemistry between Bogart and Bergman, or maybe it's the outstanding supporting cast.

923,stikedc,"I said, ""22""!",10,28 June 2002,"There's nothing like a Romantic Classic, and since the AFI recently named ""Casablanca"" as the Number One romance film of all time, here's yet another review for the Film That Has It All.  As the IMDB tagline says, ""They had a date with fate!""""Casablanca"" will take you away to a time and a place where good guys (Humphrey Bogart's Rick Blaine, who runs ""Rick's Café Americain,"" an oasis with the best music in town) were good, though flawed, bad guys were nasty Nazis, and beautiful women were, well, in a word, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman). The closeups of her alone are worth the price of admission.Based on a play, ""Everybody Comes to Rick's Place,"" the movie's dialogue is spectacular -- Rick and Louie's (Claude Rains) banter in particular is very funny, witty, and fast-paced, with no fat. The film's black-and-white texture and the exotic setting in Casablanca paint a picture of a time and a place where things fall into the grey areas in a world starkly divided between Axis and Allies.  The quirky market scenes and the opening narration (with the map, to show you exactly where Casablanca is located) set the stage for the events to follow.Claude Rains and Peter Lorre (who makes an early exit) complement Bogie perfectly, and the supporting cast -- Paul Henreid as Czech underground resistance leader (and Ilsa's husband) Victor Laszlo, the German couple trying to get to America, and Sydney Greenstreet as Ferrari, the city's black marketeer -- are nothing short of spectacular.  Every actor in this movie makes their characters 100 percent real.The entire plot -- based on Laszlo's mysterious entry into Casablanca and whether he will be able to get out to carry on his fight against the Germans -- is riveting.  Perhaps the most incredible thing about the movie is when it was made: 1942, in the heart of World War II, when the outcome was not assured.There are so many great and memorable lines in this movie that it's impossible to list them all.  It is worth noting that Rick never actually says ""Play it again, Sam"" -- he says, ""Play it, Sam!"" in a drunken stupor after Ilsa returns to his ""gin joint."" Louie's (Rains) line, ""I'm shocked, shocked, that there is gambling in this establishment!"" is almost a cliché today for things that are not really that surprising.  I love the roulette scene, where Rick sets up a win to help a Bulgarian émigré, and his line ""Have you tried 22? I said, 22!"" is also one of my personal favorites.And of course, there's The Song: ""As Time Goes By"" -- the one Ilsa, and Rick, wanted to hear again and again -- is one of the most memorable in the history of film.""Casablanca"" is about politics; it's got political intrigue, tons of hard drinking, a love triangle to end all love triangles, a few choice fight scenes (where the nasties get theirs good), and about the choices we make in hard, crucial situations in life.  But ""Casablanca"" is, more than anything else, a love story, and without giving away too much, ultimately about one of life's greatest lessons: Letting Go. The flashback scene to Rick and Ilsa's years in Paris is one of the most memorable in all of film. The airport ending is classic and will give you chills -- be sure to bring a hankie!Note:  Keep an eye out for ""Casablanca"" on the Big Screen in the summer -- it's a favorite for the outdoor free film fests and a perfect movie for a date or with family & friends!

924,Betty_Bullock,WHY ???,6,1 October 2002,"Why is everybody crazy about this film?  I just find it a decent romance film (ah, it is very conventional and safe). I laughed out loud when I saw Casablanca listed #2 Greatest films of all time by the American Film Institute ( hey, how about Fight Club, American beauty, Mulholland Drive ? ). The story of Casablanca is simply straightforward, not witty or twisted ( oh, are all Hollywood films stupid so they call this one witty ??? ). The acting is fine, Ingrid Bergman is great but Humphrey Bogart looks damn boring like a sleepwalker ( or did he try to be cool? ). Ah, the only memorable quote to me in this film is ""The problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world"". The others are forgettable and they may be classic because people consider this one a classic. ""Play it again, Sam"" for instance, what the hell? The line "" You jump I jump remember? "" in the blockbuster Titanic is even much better. The message? Very clear: love, sacrifice, anti-war propaganda. That's all. Not deep or complex at all. The only thing I like about this film is the song ""As time goes by"". It is excellent.Anyway, Casablanca is not too bad, quite enjoyable. I give it 6/10",Casablanca

The dialogue, the plot, the acting, and the music are just a few reasons why Casablanca is a masterpiece. Humphrey Bogart plays Rick Blaine, a cynical bar owner who is in love with a beautiful woman named Ilsa, played by Ingrid Bergman, but the relationship is put in a difficult position when a love triangle forms. Rick separates himself from Ilsa, being reminded of the song Ilsa loved: ""As Time goes by"".I don't know even where to start! This movie has everthing! It has action, comedy, romance, war, and drama, all packed finely into one masterpiece that will not be forgotten! The script is fantastic as one can see because of the innumerable quotable lines in the film. The acting is superb as one can tell through the numerous stars in it, for example Humphrey Bogart, Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Sydney Greenstreet, and Peter Lorre. With a cast like that, it is almost certain that there will be fine acting. The music, particularly 'As Time Goes By' is phenomenal.The movie of course has received critical acclaim. The movie has a 99% Rotten Tomatoes approval rating, and 100% Metascore, all of which I believe are suitable ratings for it. Despite some negativity in the reviews here at IMDb, this is a movie that must be watched at least once in your life. Any film buff, if it has not been seen, must see it.

927,EqbalAnwari,The movie that sort of saved my life,10,29 January 2014,"The purpose of writing this commentary is to solely state that the Writer in no way intends to compare Casablanca to any other movie in the history of motion picture; for the work is not only the pinnacle of Michael Curtiz career but also stands as a magical masterpiece in Twentieth Century Cinema.I hope I have the criterion to write a justifiable and unbiased review because this Movie is very special to me and I try not to become emotional when writing about this iconic monumental work. Considering the fact that there's nothing new to be said about Casablanca, I wonder where to start; probably from Rick's (Humphrey Bogart) philanthropy, Ilsa's (Ingrid Bergman) reciprocation—well reasoned and timely— her grace and heroism, the Battle of Anthems (German National Anthem vs French National Anthem), friendship, love, sacrifice, gallantry, patriotism, or plethora of amazing supporting actors such as Paul Henreid, Dooley Wilson, Claude Rains etc. Michael Curtiz surpasses in telling his story masterfully, directing every single actor in brilliant and indelible performance of a life time, illustrating principles and inspiring his audience to think. The writers and the Director truly outshine themselves with the phenomenal multidisciplinary story of humankind. There's so much to grab onto with a remarkable film like this; say the soothing music for example--as time goes by--or the memorable dialogue: We'll always have Paris. We lost it until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night. When I said I would never leave you. Here's looking at you kid. Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris? It's not particularly my beloved Paris. Can you imagine us in London? When you get there, ask me! I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met... Was La Belle Aurore. How nice, you remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris. Not an easy day to forget. No. I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue. Play it, Sam. Play ""As Time Goes By."" Oh, I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it. I'll hum it for you. Da dy da dy da dumb, da dy da dee da dumb... The best movies are ones that touch the soul. It takes a movie like Casablanca to touch the soul. The only other movie I have ever seen that influences me as strongly is The Shawshank Redemption. Both movies leave me feeling influenced for having watched them; they have the power to inspire people and therefore I certainly say both pictures are neatly perfect organism. But just suffice to say that in addition to watching Casablanca habitually, I also tend to watch it on the following occasions: When I see or hear cruelty or crises anywhere in this—according to the movie, crazy—world. When I decide to travel to places not being recommended by my family or friends. On the eve of Eid and New Year's Day. Every-time when I am down or empty, or whatever they call it.Finally, this timeless classic deserved not only three Academy Awards but definitely the remaining five nominations that it lost unjustifiably.",Casablanca
928,fcfrancis3,Timeless,10,8 August 2003,"Regardless of when the first time you saw Casablanca was, the movie will always remain timeless.  Boggie plays the sarcastic and charismatic Rick Blaine and the beautiful Ingrid Bergman plays the lovely Ilsa, the only woman Rick ever loved who comes back into his life after abruptly leaving him.  ""Of all the gin joints in all the cities in all the world, she comes walking into mine.""The ultimate tale of love and sacrifice, Casablanca is a movie that despite how much times change, this film never loses its magic. 
From a personal standpoint, I am not that big a fan of older movies (what some people dub ""classics"".  I generally don't like any film made before 1960.  I find the acting generally cheesy.  But along with On The Waterfront, Casablanca is still one of the most amazing movies ever made. Highly recommended.  Don't go to the video store and rent it, just go buy it.",Casablanca
929,jahandari-sina,"""Here's looking at you kid""",7,18 August 2012,"War is not that bad, I get defeated, you occupy me. How dare they are, with the world crumbling, they pick to fall in love. there is war out there, there is pain, sorrow, hopelessness.but surrounded by death and fear, they decide to set their hearts free, to enjoy their very life no matter how much overwhelming. In any category sorted by anyone, Casablanca definitely is included as one of the classics. Its genre is combination of war, romance and drama, and that is exactly what makes it so delightful. Humphrey Bogart (Rick) undoubtedly was one of the finest actors of all time and unanimously speaking, Casablanca is his best. Rick is an excellent epitome of a guy who gets tough and tougher without loosing tender. His former love leaves him high and dry in a train station in Paris and after countless restless nights of pining and sorrow he has moved on and began to run a night club in north of Africa. He is a prominent man in the town ,witty, arrogant, disdainful, clever and showing no interest for politics in spite of his former records .but deep down inside he is so heart-tender ,one of a kind lover and caring about people's lives. Then, one they out of blue, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) , his ex, walks into the bar, with her husband, demanding Sam(piano player) to play ""as time goes by"", and what is more instigating than a piece of music that reminds you of a sacred memory?! Greater the love, greater the tragedy when it's over In this movie there exist two distinguished epic scenes that emotionally for sure will change your heart beats. Once approximately in the middle of the movie there was a scene aka as 'The Battle of the Anthems' in which a group of German soldiers had come into Rick's cafe and were intoxicatingly singing the German National anthem loudly. Victor Lazlo(Ilsa's husband), the leader of the French Resistance, cannot stand this act and while the rest of the club stared reluctantly with fear at the Germans, ordered the band to play the French National Anthem, accompanied by a confirming nod from Rick, the band begins playing, with Victor singing at the top of his voice as a pioneer. This inspires the whole club to begin singing along and the Germans are forced to surrender and sit down at their table, humbled by the crowd's dedication. In my book, this was the most appealing part of the movie.In the second place, in the half way through the film a Bulgarian girl comes to Rick asking if Captain Renault is trustworthy. She and her husband are refugees. there is war in their country, they have left their house, they have no money, they are fleeing from death, from misery from fear. they need visas or something and it is inferred that captain Renault has promised her to trade the paperwork they need with couple of minutes of her time .now she is in a dilemma. Frightened, hopeless and fragile. suspended between their security and her self- esteem, now she wants to know if she grants her body to Captain Renault will he do them the favor back or not. And in the case if he does in Rick's opinion what she is going to do is forgivable?! Ilsa flashes in Rick's mind and he replies the Bulgarian girl in a line:"" go back to Bulgaria"". Stating that in his idea it's better to suffer and murdered than selling one-self. Though he afterwards he does a marvelous thing and helps the husband to win in gambling and provide the money they need to regulates their migration.To put the whole thing in a nutshell, Casablanca is a mixture of all life giving elements. overlapping of humor and drama, love and war, toughness and heart-tenderness. And hell yeah it is amusing.",Casablanca
930,killerquean,Everybody comes to Rick's,10,3 August 2014,"Looking back over seventy-two years of film history, this one is a crown jewel. The only 'special effects' are a man playing a piano, desperate people singing the French national anthem and a simulation of a prop-plane bound for Lisbon. There is no massive body count, foul language or nudity. The super- hero's secret weapon is his conscience.I'm no prude. I applaud this film because it doesn't insult its audience by assuming that they don't know how to think. There are subtle moments that evoke feelings that are absent in the comic book/'graphic novel' pulp fiction that overwhelms every summer movie season lately. When the young French girl that Rick's jilted realizes that a rebound liaison with a German SS officer is a futile and degrading gesture; when the Bulgarian newlywed is faced with the choice of betraying her husband to gain their freedom and Rick rigs the roulette wheel to save her from living a lie; when the French resistance operative is caught without papers and shot under the motto "" Liberté, Égalité, Fraternité"" (which sets the tone for the story); we are reminded that this type of intelligent screen-writing is very nearly a lost art. This and two of Chaplin's talkies (The Great Dictator and M. Verdeux) caught the spirit of the world that was in the grips of real evil. But Casablanca hits all the moral/ethical hot topics. Would anyone still care about this film if Rick had run off with Ilsa? There were many films made during WWII that exploited the issues, but this one made it very personal on a lot of levels. The Epstein brothers earned that Oscar. Bogart should have gotten one as well. And it's traveled well. If you don't have a gut-level reaction when Paul Henreid's character risks his life to urge the house band to play ""La Marseillaise"", check for a pulse, because you may have a fatal heart condition, mon ami.Pull up a chair, and let Dooley Wilson (who had a long history in vaudeville and the theater with Orson Welles) take you away--the fundamental things apply...",Casablanca
931,m-vandeyar,One of the greats,9,14 November 2012,"There isn't much that hasn't already been said about ""Casablanca"". The movie is one of the all-time greats and for good reason. It not only redefines the classic love story but also provides a riveting plot with a truly blockbuster cast. The generally low lighting in the whole of the film really captures the dark, heartbroken, and lonely life of the stoic-faced bar/club owner Rick (Bogart). There is never a dull point in the plot and the characters provide memorable dialogue with flashbacks providing background details of their pasts throughout. A beautiful set and tremendous camera-work round out the other great points of what is arguably the greatest movie of all time. Easily one of the best movies to watch for those who want to experience a real classic.",Casablanca
932,Phillip-Riback,Words are Sufficient,10,31 July 2013,"""This is a beginning of a beautiful friendship"" – that is how this unforgettable and everlasting movie, which talks about love, friendship, loyalty, intrigue, and survival ends. The play takes place in the city of Casablanca, and even though we are unable to see the city (because the action takes place mainly in Ricks' bar), the life of the city is present. On one side are refugees waiting to escape from the horrors of war, and on the other are those who still enjoy nights full of gambling and entertainment, or smuggling and enrichment. The love story is started in war Paris, and revived through the memories in the currently more peaceful Morocco. The fact that love is stronger and larger than any other living thing, and subordinate to world events, is show in the decisions Rick (H. Bogart) makes. Although the movie is black-and-white, it even more emphasizes time events. There is also a color version of the film, but it feels like something is missing. If you have a chance to watch it, you shouldn't miss this masterpiece. And if you have watched it... Play It Again Sam.",Casablanca
933,mnjanco,The Best Movie Ever Made,10,6 December 2004,"It's hard not to repeat others when commenting on the movie that many people consider to be the best of all times. The Film Institute ranks it number two behind Citizen Kane. I like Citizen Kane very much, but I do not think it is anywhere near as good as Casablanca. It is simply the finest blend of script, sets, characters, casting, music and photography that Hollywood has ever produced. Who can forget the shadow of the dancing woman on the wall? Has there ever been a funnier straight man than Claude Raines? Or an oilier villain than Peter Lorre? The scene where Paul Heinried leads the audience in the Marseillaise is rightfully one of the most touching in the history of the cinema. But what impressed me is how the French National Anthem blended with the German song the Nazis were singing, so well that it sounded like a round. As much as I liked the movie itself, I never appreciated it as much until I bought the VHS version showing the making of the movie. How many viewers realize that the writers didn't know which of the lead characters Ilse would go off with until literally the end of the movie? How many know that three different directors worked on various parts of the movie? Or that it was one of the most brilliant success stories of a movie put together by committee? Not too many years ago, the favorite trivia ""factoid"" was that Bogart never said ""Play it again, Sam."" He actually said, ""Play it, Sam."" I still get misty-eyed every time I hear As Time Goes By. It's very unusual that I remember the theme from a modern movie by the time I leave the theatre. Only the Ring Trilogy has come close to matching Casablanca in so many different ways. But who wants to watch something for ten hours when you can get the same effect in an hour and a half?",Casablanca

And if the movie is great like this, my judgment has very low criteria.What to say about Casablanca. Nothing bad, absolutely. This movie left one of the biggest mark in the history of cinematography. I just don't discuss about movies with people who didn't watch Casablanca. That movie is unavoidable.I'm so sorry that Humphrey Bogart didn't won Oscar. He has a fantastic role, and he act that absolutely genius. On the other side is Ingrid Bergman who is gorgeous and selfish women. She is very good too.The main action in movie begins like many movies, and i can bet that everyone expect that Rick will stay with Ilsa in the end. That buy me so much. Rick as a character showing us that no one can outwit him. He is one of rarely characters who listen his mind, not his heart.For the end, i must commend the director of the movie, Michael Curtiz. Fantastic story, fantastic actors, fantastic picture. Must watch everyone.",Casablanca
937,lashoffjm,Casablanca great movie,9,11 March 2015,"I had alway's heard that Casablanca was a classic, but had no idea what it was actually about. The whole cast was likable and clever. My favorite character was the French man that was supposed to be working with the Germans, but generally looked out for himself. This was a common theme that I enjoyed. Every character had an agenda and it was up the audience figure it out. I have to say although the plot was explained to me, there was just so much going on and I am sure there were many subtle jokes that I missed. Again I like how a director can take such a serious issue and make it comical without losing the message. I think that this was the best black and white movie I have seen to date and will be watching it again to see what I missed.",Casablanca

The first thing that grabbed me was Humphrey Bogart. He did an excellent job portraying his character rick. Rick was a smooth, calm, collect kinda guy which set the mood. All of the actors/actresses contributed some very good acting too. The lighting was top notch and the music will stick in your head. The story which took place in the ww2 era, was very exciting to follow and did not let up once in grabbing your attention. The movie was full of dialog that I've heard in other films and TV shows but never knew it until I watched it. I recommend this movie to just about anyone with a heart and half a brain. So heres looking at you Casablanca.",Casablanca

Well, I will add to that short list. Ever since I was a kid, I heard of Casablanca as ""one of the best movies ever made"". Sorry, folks. I watched it three times, and the more I watch the less I like it.The characters are as empty as sea-shells. Bogart (whom I never found a bit attractive anyway) mumbles through the story, as a one-dimensional ""cynical with a big heart"" (my god, what a novelty!!), Bergman cries a lot, but as a compliant female does what she's told and follows her husband: Rick is a man, he knows what's best for her, and her husband needs her support, he's a war hero!! I would rather be alone, anyway, if I had to  choose between dull Laszlo and cowardly Rick!Fortunately Claude Rains can be funny, though utterly unlikely as an officer who at the last moment chooses to ""be good"". Nothing is convincing!I have nothing against ""classics"", as Parca (another user) said before: I love Lawrence of Arabia, The Night of the Hunter (now THAT is a movie!!), Gone With the Wind... But Casablanca cannot be worshipped as one of the ""best ever"". It's the forties' version of a pop-corn movie. Should you see it if you haven't yet? Yeah, why not? Otherwise, how can you judge?Just don't think you HAVE TO love it.",Casablanca
943,Horatio-7,Perhaps the Most Powerful scene ever,10,22 July 1999,"Casablanca is a film which must be seen in context. It was made in 1942 at the height of the war, and many of the film's actors are actual refugees. As for real heartfelt film emotion, I will take the scene with the dueling anthems of Germany and France against any other. The scene captures the humanity of hope and pride. It is a symbol of the never say die attitude which would help to win the war (which in '42 was very much in question). The scene is among the greatest artistic achievements of the 20th century.",Casablanca

Keep in mind this was 1942 and the Nazi menace had swallowed Europe. What took place on the screen would take place in realty three years later.  Anyone not moved by this sence has no sense of history.Borgats,  character is as interesting as that sence is inpirational. He starts as the bitter man yet we see these signs of altrusim.  He rigs the Casino so he can loose money rather than see the Calous police cheif virtualy rape a young girl. The Altruism wins just as the french singers win in the cafe.The Romance and the espionage come together. Bogart makes the choice. He says ""I'm not much on being noble....""

946,hesdras,Thank God this film was made when smoking was still socially acceptable,9,14 July 2000,"I have usually been bored or disappointed with the so-called ""timeless classics"" I have bothered to watch, but not with this one. It has its flaws, but for some reason it just works anyway. Some of the flaws are: Laszlo's character, which is so totally virtuous you just want to take out a gun and shoot him immediately (it was fine for the 40's, but I think we expect a bit more ambiguity in nice guys nowadays); the ridiculous final scene where we're expected to believe that Renault continues obeying Rick's instructions even though Rick has forgotten all about pointing his gun at him because he's too busy saying sweet nothings to Ilsa; and just generally I'm afraid the film is a bit sappy and full of cliches (and don't tell me this film invented the cliches, it didn't: they're as old as corny love stories, and those go back very far indeed). The reason it just works anyway is, I think, simply Bogart. No one ever incarnated so perfectly the man every man wishes he was and the man every woman wishes she could meet. And he smokes so beautifully... Bergman is great too, but her character isn't nearly as well developed.A word of advice: if you haven't seen the film before and you happen to get hold of the ""special edition"" with 1/2 hour of ""making of"" stuff before the feature, fast-forward to the film and watch it before watching the introductory material, because it is spoiler city.",Casablanca

What is also fabulous is the background material which come on the laser/dvd versions, with accoompanying audio commentaries, still photos and an accompanying documentary hosted by Laren Bacall (Mrs. Bogart).  The worst thing that has ever happened to this movie was the issue of a colorized version several years ago, which is actually difficult to find.

952,Lee_Baker,As Time Goes By...,10,16 July 2008,"What else can I say about 'Casablanca' that hasn't already been said? Truth is, there isn't much; but there is a lot to be said about this movie, so I'm gonna give you my opinion on this legend of a film.'Rick's Cafe Americain', 1941: War erupts throughout Europe and the US. Cynical bar owner Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) will not help anyone in need of assistance: He ""sticks his neck out for nobody."" He is visited in his Cafe by a German trouble-causer by the name of Ugarte (Peter Lorre) who is on the run. Ugarte asks Rick to safeguard two letters of transit (or VISA's) to leave Morocco which have been reported as stolen. Rick holds these in the piano of his entertainer and good friend, Sam (Dooley Wilson).Ugarte is tracked down and immediately killed by the authorities. Meanwhile, French resistance leader Victor Laszlo enters the bar with his lady, Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), Sam panics and hopes that Rick stays out of the way - knowing that it will only cause a fuss - Ilsa also knows this, but she desperately wants to see Rick, so she asks Sam to play 'As Time Goes By' (a song that Rick banned soon after his and Ilsa's break-up). Rick storms out of the back, he goes berserk; only to look up at Ilsa. He gives a shy smirk, and in that 5-10 second freeze the audience feels their pre-existing passion and love for each other as the camera switches from face to face.Ultimately, the decision lies with Rick as to whether he takes the two VISA's for himself and Ilsa, or for Ilsa and Victor. His subsequent decision to leave himself in Morocco is a heartbreaking, but nevertheless honourable, one.Everyone and their cat should know that 'Casablanca' is one of the most often spoofed/quoted movies in film history. Here are a few of them:""Play it, Sam, play 'As Time Goes By'. You played it for her, now play it for me!""""Round up the usual suspects.""""Here's lookin' at you, kid.""""We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we got it back last night.""""Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""(Rick) ""This gun is aimed directly at your heart."" (Captain Renault) ""Lucky for me, that is my least vulnerable spot.""(Rick) ""I came to Casablanca for the waters."" (Captain Renault) ""The Waters? You're in the middle of a desert."" (Rick) ""I was misinformed.""""I stick my neck out for nobody.""""I'm the only cause I'm interested in.""(Guest) ""What nationality are you, Rick?"" (Rick) "" ...I'm a drunkard."" (Captain Renault) ""That makes Rick a citizen of the world.""...So now you see why this movie is a major motion picture classic?

Hollywood does owe a lot from this film and it is Boigie at his finest ahead of its time. if you are a movie lover or an inspiring director/writer this is a great way to make a film. this movie in my opoion was THE classic and started the meaning of the word. if you are into action movies of now a days then I don't recommend this but if you into seeing movies at there finest this is a must see.,Casablanca
956,dindi-se,It really is THAT perfect,10,23 February 2016,"We are often accused of being nostalgic, of irrationally defending the works and achievements of the past in detriment of keeping up with the times, accepting the changes as a natural part of life, a sign of evolution and growth. Take « Casablanca », for instance. The story is constantly placed at the top positions in specialized lists that name the best movies ever made. Michael Curtiz never managed to become one of the greatest directors of all times. Visually, « Casablanca » is not at all very different from many of the other movies made during its era. Can it really be so? Can it really be that in more than seventy years of movie-making ever since, few pictures can come close to claiming this spot?Set in the title city, « Casablanca » centers itself on the story of Rick Blaine (a majestic and sombre Humphrey Bogart), a seemingly cold and cynic north-American bar owner living in the midst of World War II and who wants to state, above all, his political independence. Different nationalities find in the bar owned by Rick a meeting place to relax, listen to some music, or design escape plans to other destinations. Being able to leave Casablanca seems, to some, just a wish, and Rick's bar is the place where they can allow themselves to dream, or see their wishes of freedom crumble due to the prolongation of the wait.Enter Ilsa Lund (the always perfect Ingrid Bergman) and her husband, the activist Victor Lazslo (played here by Paul Henreid). The reencounter between Ilsa and Rick brings back memories of a romance that has passed, a story that came to pieces on the same day the city of Paris fell to the Germans during the War. Romance and politics appear heavily interlinked, and start to expose that certain things may be beyond our control, that personal sacrifices may be called for when one faces the War.« As Time Goes By » played by the pianist Sam (Dooley Wilson), the great friend of Ilsa and Rick, becomes a character in itself, larger than life, and reminds all of the characters that certain feelings do not change with time. The expressions in their faces reveals all of the feelings that they so strongly tried to suppress.Rick, however, is the only alternative for Ilsa and Victor to reach safety. He will have to struggle between keeping his widely defended neutrality, recovering an old love or turn Lazslo in. The story delivers in every single aspect: it brings together politics, romance, betrayal, action, friendship and melancholia while exploring the historical context and presenting a magnificent story that certainly resisted the test of time. The script and dialogues are on point here - emotionally heartbreaking and exciting. While certain movies can indeed be considered technically superior to « Casablanca », few have managed to conquer, snatch up and connect with the viewer as well as this one. Built with a fantastic cinematography work based on chiaroscuro and sublime close- ups, mythical scenarios and superb use of mise-en-scène, it adds something to every new viewing. The city of Paris becomes a place to represent dreams and heartbreaks and Casablanca a place where we may never want to leave.",Casablanca
957,santiken,Top 5 movies of all time...,10,12 November 2010,"I think you can judge a movie by how many times you watch it...I have watched Casablanca over 50 times! The characters, the location, the music and the story all come together perfectly to form a masterpiece that never grows tiring. This is a movie that definitely grows on you. The first time I watched it I was somewhat confused by the story but after a few more viewings I fell in love with the movie and all the personalities. Rick is a character that exudes leadership and it shows by how much his staff at Rick's respect and love him so very much. They seem so genuine and that feeling of love rubs off on you and suddenly you find yourself loving and respecting Rick as well. It's these types of emotions that make this movie so powerful. The music is another element of the movie that stirs up your emotions from the scene at Rick's where Laszlo is singing of the Marselliase and Yvonne's 'Vive La France!...just so very inspiring. You must see it for yourself...but please don't judge it on the first viewing...give it a few tries on a cold dark night and I promise you will fall in love with this movie.",Casablanca

959,David_Hart,The best hollywood movie of all-time,10,8 November 2003,"When people ask me what is the best movie of all-time is I don't flinch, I just say ""Casablanca"". It has everything a great movie should have: romance, sacrifice, wonderful lines, a memorable song, incredible acting (even in the smallest roles) and it is one of the few non-film noir movies filmed in the B&W era that I wouldn't want to see refilmed in color (that is in definite contrast to ""I Know Where I'm Going!"" which begs to be refilmed to show the beauty of its vistas). But the key that makes everything works is the ending. I don't think the ending that exists in Casablanca could be filmed today and though most have seen this movie (or any of its parodies) I don't want to give anything away. But I encourage you to compare the ending of this movie with the endings of other romantic movies such as ""An Affair to Remember"", ""Sleepless in Seattle"" and even the most recent animated ""Sinbad"" movie. Contrast their endings with Casablanca's ending and you see how Casablanca resonates. Many movies have tried to emulate the ending of Casablanca but it never quite rings true because hollywood movies aren't allowed to have this ending yet the only ones who try are either independent or anti-hollywood.",Casablanca

But for me, Casablanca is a movie that I grew older watching. Since many have commented on its plot and greatness, I will skip the obligated summary of Casablanca and go immediately into my review.Casablanca is a movie that has matured with me; the more life experiences I had, the more enjoyable it was. As an example, the scene where Ilsa listens to Sam play As Time Goes By seemed extraneous before I experienced my first heartbreak. Now, when I hear her tear up with the song in the background, I feel like I could cry with her. The movie was more enjoyable the more I watched it as well. For the first time, I thought it was all right. But on the subsequent viewings, I saw the small nuances and expressions in Rick and Ilsa's actions as they tried to stay casual despite having a tragic past; I recognized that all the dialogue was necessary to accumulate in an unforgettable ending; and as I mentioned above, I empathized with the characters more and more.Watching Casablanca is like watching the sunset. The longer you look, the more times you look, the more beautiful it gets.",Casablanca
962,ankimagine,Didn't like it,5,24 September 2012,"I really didn't like the movie. I watch plenty of movies both new and old. Its also not that i don't like oldies(really liked City lights, Roman Holiday, 12 angry Men) and i am huge fan of classics. But this was a really weird movie and I certainly dint get what the movie was all about. Boring to hell, very slow and lots of talk. Though i agree that acting was great, specially of the Rick character, actress was really beautiful and therefore I gave this movie a 5 rating or i would have been 1. Maybe I don't have the correct vision for these type of movies so I couldn't get it. But still i would say, this movie sucks.",Casablanca
963,howardbrown,Awesome classic,10,1 February 2012,"While my personal Bogey favorite is still his Sam Spade in 'The Maltese Falcon', his cynical nightclub owner, Rick, in 'Casablanca', is also a standout. Rather than some ""off the cuff"" comments, I'll quote instead from my article on Claude Rains (from March 2000 issue of CLASSIC IMAGES) that pretty well sums up the film: ""It was 1943's 'Casablanca', bustling with melodramatic wartime intrigue, that really put him (Claude Rains) in the forefront as one of the screen's smoothest character actors, almost--but not quite--stealing the film from Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, as the uniformed Captain Louis Renault who investigates the goings-on at Rick's notorious cafe.Nobody associated with the film guessed that it would become a screen classic, least of all its director, Michael Curtiz, the prolific WB director to whom it was just another assignment. It went on to win the Oscar for Best Film of 1943 with an award for Curtiz' taut direction.Oddly enough, the film's memorable airport ending was written and conceived just shortly before filming wrapped up, with neither Bergman nor Bogart knowing whether or not she would leave him for husband Paul Henried. Wartime audiences loved the film. Sydney Greenstreet, Conrad Veidt, Victor Francen and Peter Lorre all gave sterling performances and Rains was again nominated for Best Supporting actor."" And by the way, I disagree with a former comment indicating the black and white photography of this film was primitive as compared to today's. Incredible nonsense!! As a matter of fact, the film's black and white cinematography was nominated for an Oscar! Ingrid Bergman was at the peak of her radiant beauty in this one--and Bogey was firing on all six cylinders. Great chemistry! As time goes by, we still have 'Casablanca'...",Casablanca
964,varagirl85,Almost flawless film,9,25 January 2013,"It is one the most exquisitely well thought out and put together film in history. If you are not paying attention right from the beginning, you'll miss the beginning set-up, which is the key to appreciating the rest of the film. What really makes the movie is the importance and urgency of the time that the film is set -- for all the characters in this story, for this one small gin joint and this one very obscure city, for all of Europe and all the world. What is particularly important is the desperation of this moment in history. It is brilliantly boiled down into a tableau of detailed interwoven personal stories of greed, power and need, love and sacrifice, loyalty and betrayal. The acting is flawless across the board with these iconic actors really shinning; the screenplay dialogue is smart, witty, with hardly an unnecessary word; the direction and cinematography are flawless, with each scene framed like a movie poster; and the musical numbers contribute the environment and the emotional gravitas without making the film be contrived. I had to watch this film twice before I could fully appreciate it; there's that much to take in.",Casablanca
965,ukrdat,Masterpiece,10,5 January 2006,"It is surely the best films of all times.At first, when I haven't seen it, I thought it is overrated stupid drama as lots of films nowadays.I really hate romantic and drama films, I vomit from ""Titanic"" and fall asleep on ""Schindler's List"", but Casablanca...It's other. It has something. Something like charm, thing that can't be produced by modern technology or cutting edge effects. Casablanca is a film that you will never want to end. The perfect example of Noir, every scene can be considered a separate piece of art. How actors move, what they say, how they say, everything is PERFECT.And it was filmed more than 50 years ago. During war. Unthinkable. Now, I understand why people say that films long ago were better than nowadays. Cause they WERE. May be it is not the best film I ever seen, but it is surely 10 times better than any other Drama that I have seen.",Casablanca
966,eliz_balaur,BORING and ARTIFICIAL. The emperor has no clothes.,1,24 March 2015,"This is the only movie review I have ever written on IMDb. I watched Casablanca witch high hopes. I KNEW I was going to love this movie after hearing for years how it's ""the best"" and what an amazing, moving, love story it portrays. I was very excited and ready to be swept off my rear end by this classic everyone adores. Casablanca is one of the movies I disliked the most. Actually I think it's my number one most disliked movie. It's not that I don't like old movies or I have a short attention span. I've seen Gone with the wind multiple times and love it. One of my favorite movies is a *1951 Indian, BLACK AND WHITE, ROMANCE* (!!!) movie, I've also seen that numerous times. Casablanca is as boring and plain as a movie can get. It's 102 minutes of nothing interesting happening AT ALL. Gone with the wind is a slow movie that needs patience to watch but lots of interesting things happen, there is a traceable story line and the characters are not plain and one-dimensional like in Casablanca. What happens in this movie? Is there anything interesting happening at all that anybody can point out to? I don't think so.It's just 102 minutes of random boring people talking about random boring stuff. When I read good reviews of Casablanca I have never seen or heard anyone point out to anything interesting actually happening in this movie. Just how pretty Ingrid was, how cool Bogart was, how well done the movie is, how impeccable the acting is, silly meaningless quotes like ""here's looking at you kid"" and just that it's a ""timeless classic"". I just think this whole Casablanca thing is a gimmick and a case of ""the emperor's clothes"". There is nothing to be well acted or well done because there is nothing happening during the whole movie. I think it would be way more interesting to just film random conversations between random people in bars.And the love story between the two main protagonists has to be the least believable I've ever seen. I enjoy and get emotionally moved very much by a love story, it doesn't even need to be very good. I cry when I read Hans Christian Andersen's ""The Steadfast Tin Soldier"" for eff's sake. There is absolutely zero chemistry between the two main actors. Their ""love story"" is completely artificial, superficial and there is zero emotion portrayed. They seem to be acquaintances at best, not even friends, not to mention lovers. I've seen better simulated ""attraction"" or ""love"" in porn dialogues than in Casablanca. No, forget that, I can detect more love and attraction when two butterflies dance together or I see rabbits mating. I'm not even kidding or exaggerating.This movie made me feel nothing at all, absolutely nothing except boredom. It's unique in this particularity. There is no other movie I can remember that made me feel NOTHING AT ALL. Bad movies at least amuse me. Casablanca is completely devoid of any emotion. Casablanca is the cinematic equivalent of a mouthful of sand. There was no character I could empathize with in the slightest way as there were no real, humane characters to empathize with. Just artificiality. I'm completely mesmerized about how can people adore this movie so much. It's boring, plain, bone-dry, story-less and features the least believable love stories I have ever seen. Excuse me, I'm not a connoisseur like you Casablanca lovers, but I have common sense. And common sense tells me a movie doesn't have to be necessarily very ""entertaining"" but it needs to be ENJOYABLE, reasonably ENGAGING and just in the least to have some INTERESTING things happening. Casablanca has none of this things in the slightest. Please leave aside your love for this movie, imagine for one minute you don't know who Ingrid and Bogart were and this movie was completely unknown. You've never heard a thing about this movie your entire life and you just watch it not knowing anything about it or the actors. Would you enjoy it? I guarantee you would be bored out of your mind. That is why it is not a ""TIMELESS"" classic. Here's two movies I would consider timeless classics: Papillon and The Good, The Bad and the Ugly. Not this bore fest. I would give Casablanca a negative rating if I could.",Casablanca

Despite this, I can see why this was a huge film for Hollywood and regarded as a classic movie. In my opinion, I don't think there were enough moments that got me engaged within the movie so I couldn't give it a higher rating.The film is set in Casablanca, Morocco and the main character Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) owns a nightclub. This nightclub is called 'Rick's Cafe Americain' and this represents America's dominance all over the world and it signifies wherever there is American ownership, there is power. This is a example of surveillance during 1942. Later on in the film we get to know Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) and we find out that he is in a relationship with Rick's ex Isla Lund (Ingrid Bergman), she is a French girl and to show his love for Isla, Laszlo sings La Marseillaise. I thought this was powerful as it reinforces the idea of patriotism during the time of war.At the end of the film, we find out that Rick still loves his ex Isla despite her leaving him and Rick does the right thing for Isla by sending her back to France. We see that he puts people before himself because even though he loves this girl he does the right thing for her by sending her home.",Casablanca

I was a dumb teenager who saw it as only an assignment. The second time I saw it was 25 years later. The century old downtown theater hosts a summer movie series every year from June through August. I was divorced from my ex-wife for about a year. My youngest step-son, Kyle, was 11 at the time. He's was, and still is, a huge movie fan. He loves the classics, even at that young of an age. He was over for a weekend visit and he suggested that we go downtown to see Casablanca. I agreed and off we went. I can honestly say that night changed my life. I absolutely fell in love with this movie. Even though I had already seen it, it was like seeing it for the first time. I wasn't clouded with my teenage narrow mindedness. Casablanca is my all time favorite movie and I watch it about every other month, on a Friday or Saturday night, with the lights out.

There's something simple and pure about the way it evokes its emotional power, somehow never losing that power over time.  Also, I must say that Humphrey Bogart suddenly became the single man I wanted to be like after watching this film, more than Sean Connery, more than James Dean.  He has this coolness which remains the pinnacle.  True, this style and character is much better shown in The Maltese Falcon.  In Casablanca Bogart is exposed; his coldness came from a broken heart, and he still has some of that compassion left within him. But I still look up to him, and deeply feel for him.",Casablanca

Yet despite this, ""Casablanca"" remains as one of my all-time favorite movies.  It's hard to say what makes this movie so great.  Maybe its because it delivers a much more REAL romance, of self-sacrificial love; or maybe its more simply that Ingrid Bergman is possible the most gorgeous woman to ever walk on this planet since the great Helen of Troy.

In fact, I love it. Humphrey Bogart is fabulous as Rick, and Ingrid Bergman is absolutely beautiful as Ilsa, one of the best female characters ever, I think.A side from the performances, the script has thousands of beautiful lines, like ""The world is falling a part and we're falling in love"", and it also has great dialogues: ""What's your nationality"", someone asks Rick; ""Drunk"", he answers.The story mix perfectly the fabulous love story with a perfect portrayal of the life of the European refugees in Casablanca, trying to escape the II World War by going to the U.S.A movie to cry, to think, to fall in love with Bergman, and to (at first) hate and then love Boggie.As many say, a classic.",Casablanca

It's a shame that, being a guy, I first saw this incredibly romantic love story with another guy, but it still jerked tears.  I was most amazed with how the familiar and famous lines, so many of which were already part of my psyche, just kept coming and coming.Now, I own the movie and have most of it memorized.  I get a great thrill from introducing it to people, watching them hear those line for the first time in context.  I teach English now and use the film as a study in plot, foreshadowing, and Freytag's Triangle (or Climactic Triangle).As a list maker, i have for years made favorite movies lists.

""As time goes by"" will always remain a classic and the scene with Sam and Rick where Rick says ""You played it for her, you can play it for me. Play it, Sam"" is among the best movie lines ever. But my preferred line is when the movie gets to the end, ""Louie, i think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"".

Though it's most likely my own taste, I fail to see what other people see in this film.My saving grace for this film was allows me to rate is higher than I would, is the acting of Ingrid Bergman and Humphery Bogart, as well as the beautiful soundtrack and (as I mentioned before) the filming style which was nice to watch and interesting on the eyes.",Casablanca

988,OfficialPaul,Possibly the Greatest Romance Movie of All-Time,10,5 May 2013,"One of the best romance movies of all-time. Casablanca made Humphrey Bogart a top star in Hollywood and Ingrid Bergman a respectable actress. Claude Rains is also great in the movie and is an important character. Michael Curtiz, who I believe is one of the greatest directors of all-time, directs this the same year as Yankee Doodle Dandy. Curtiz direction was flawless and the close-ups mainly on Bergmann shown the emotions were great. The cinematography was astounding which makes the viewer seem like they're in the room. Despite the screenplay not being 100% realistic and believable, I don't think anyone cares because of how well and effective the movie is. The dialog is one of the best in cinema history which contains many famous quotes. This movie shows how important romance, friendship, and politics could be. The beginning introduces Rick (Bogart) who owns ""Rick's Café Américain"" which is a nightclub and a place for gambling located in Casablanca which is in Northern Africa.. Usually the Vichy French, Italian, and Nazi officials go there. Rick looks like a professional businessman but seems depress for a reason we do not know. Ugarte (Peter Lorre), a petty criminal, arrives in Rick's club with ""letters of transit"" obtained through the murder of two German couriers. The papers allow the person to travel freely around German-controlled Europe and to neutral Portugal, and from there to America. Ugarte plans to make his money by selling them to the highest bidder. However that does not work out according to plan and Rick ends up with the letters. Eventually Ilsa (Bergman) comes in with a man and Sam (Dooley Wilson) notices this and is not thrilled. She asks if Rick is there and Sam doesn't her to see Rick. She tells Sam to play ""As Time Goes By."" Sam seeming like he doesn't want to plays it anyway which angers Rick. Rick then realizes Ilsa is there and seems upset and happy at the same time. It is realized that the man with her was her husband Victor Laszlo (Henreid). Laszlo is refugee that is trying to go to America. Later that night Rick seems really upset about seeing her again and Sam tries to comfort him. While they are talking flashbacks are shown about Rick and Ilsa as lovers in Paris. While in Paris Rick had to flee and Ilsa plans to go with him however the minute that he leaves Sam gives him the letter from her saying she won't. Ilsa basically broke Rick's heart but now needs help along with her husband. Many viewers question who is going to get Ilsa, Rick or Victor? Is Rick going to help Ilsa after what she did to him?",Casablanca

The movie is touching and the scene that touches me the most is when Sam plays ""As Time Goes By."" The North African Location is exotic and adds to the feeling of romance. Humphrey Bogart as Rick is great and you can see his longing for Ingrid Bergman. The flashback scenes in Paris are the greatest expressions of romance ever filmed and you can see the love they shared and how it comes full circle in Casablanca. A lot of famous line are from this movie such as ""Sing It Sam"", ""Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think?

There is nothing I could see particularly insightful or original in this movie. It was as bland as a baked potato with no garnishings, not even some salt. Perhaps this is the type of movie that people who don't like to have to think to much, like. The plot is not so bad, it had potential, but seemed to be left to wither in the hands of a weak script and somewhat inept acting. Who is Bogart supposed to be, James Bond with a broken heart? Trying to put this ultra cool James Bond character into the ""real"" world, just doesn't work for me. I never really find Bogart's character believable, so I never really connect with the character. The catch phrase lines, like ""Here's lookin' at you kid."" are as profound as Schwatzenager's ""I'll be back"". If this was an action type adventure story like Raider's of the Lost ark, I could overlook some of these things. But this movie seems to be first and foremost a love story. And in that sense, I think it fails. I could go on with much more criticism of this movie, but I don't want to beet it to death. It is not an awful movie, more of a very light cute little thing.

It was filmed in 1941-2, while Nazi Germany still had a FIRM grasp over Europe, the Allies were behind in many aspects in the conflict, and it shows in the film! The insecurity of the people watching this film at the time about how things were going to turn out is the most fascinating part of watching Casablanca! Think about it: When this film was being made and even during its release, people were wondering daily if Europe was going to remain in the hold of the facists, and if the Americas (North and South American Continents) were going to be the last part of the world left as ""free"" nations! Whenever one of my friends asks me about this movie when they see it on my movie shelf, that is what I tell them---and it makes them all the more interested in seeing it. Just to be able to get a glimpse of the Insecurity the allied nations & citizens felt about the future, is perhaps the biggest reason for people to watch it. So much is made about its perfect style, dialogue, acting, etc---which is true and certainly helps---but to me, the most important thing to keep in mind while watching Casablanca, is that at this time, people were really concerned that the Allies might not be able to 'totally' win the war. By totally I mean, being able to not just stop the Germans and Japanese, but be able to push them out of the tremendous areas of the world that they controlled when this film was made! Add to that, that at the time there was such an Isolationist movement in the US, that there were millions who felt the best that could be achieved was a stalemate which would keep the western hemisphere free, with the eastern hemisphere under the influence of Germany and Japan. Thats part of the reason why you hear the actors make comments about ""Isolationism is no longer practical in todays world"" etc.Just watching Casablanca with that perspective, should make even the people who aren't thrilled with noir movies, at least view THIS film a little differently from a historical perspective---since it is literally a snapshot of the Allied uncertainty at the time. Just my two cents, but thats really the main reason I love watching this film, and why I repeat view it to watch for that feeling within it. If you haven't seen this film yet, you're missing a piece of history!",Casablanca
997,samiran-ghosh71,One of the best movies ever made,10,14 February 2013,"This is possibly one of the best movies ever made. Every character has a part and take the story forward. It is a masterpiece of story-telling and the craft of movie making. Signor Ferrari, Carl, Sascha and all the uncredited actors at Rick;s make for a evergreen Hollywood flick. Max Steiner's music and Owen Marks' edited create a taut and always lovable cinematic experience. Can watch it any number of times.In fact, I have watched this movie in silent with background narrations from several movie critics who take you through scene by scene explaining what happened, what was intended, what happened by accident, the symbolisms and artistic intent of the director. I would not have believed that it is a good way to watch a movie if I had not seen Casablanca that way. Amazing Stuff.......",Casablanca
998,etodell97,Ehh...,4,7 April 2014,"I've had this DVD sitting on my shelf for a while, and I'd been working my way through all of the other movies surrounding it. I finally forced myself to watch it using the logic of ""it's ranked high on the IMDb Top 250, how bad could it be"".To clarify, I am not saying that Casablanca is a bad movie, I'm just not saying it's fantastic. I can see how it might be ""groundbreaking"" and ""innovative"" back when it was made in the 40's, but in todays world, it is not amazing. It's very difficult to compare a movie from the 40's to a movie from the 21st century, in fact the only way I know to compare movies is based on my afterthoughts. What qualifies a movie as 10 stars for me, is a movie that either gives me the chills at the needs because of how amazing the ending was, or if the movie keeps me thinking about it for days afterward. It's a movie that has an ending that is permanently engraved in me. Movies like The Shawshank Redmption, The Sixth Sense, The Intouchables, Memento, The Green Mile, Full Metal Jacket, etc...A 9 star movie is a movie that I find to be entertaining, but not quite as memorable as a 10 star. The 9 star category for me has a lot of good movies in the category, such as Pulp Fiction, American Beauty, One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest, Fight Club, etc... However, Casablanca is not as memorable as any of those movies either. The movie is not, I just don't find myself challenged by the movie. The acting was okay, but nothing that blew my mind. I understand the message of the movie, and how powerful it was supposed to be. The movie was slow, too slow for me. It left me with the same problems as the Godfather; I think that the movie is building up to some dramatic ending, but then it just mellows out. This seems like the kind of movie that was regarded as the best of all time for many years, but, unfortunately for fans of this movie, there are many other movies that surpass this one. My opinion is that people tend to rate movies they consider ""classics"" higher than the new blockbusters, even if both eras are capable of producing movies that are equally as good as one another. Honestly, the only reason why this movie doesn't get a higher rating than it has (from me) is because there was never a part in the movie where I felt like I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, but there were scenes where I began to fall asleep. Five minutes after the movie was over, I found myself thinking about my plans for the following day, and what I planned on having for dinner. When I watched higher rated movies, for example Into The Wild (10 stars), I found myself putting myself into the protagonists situation, and then i found myself running to the bookstore to get the book about the true story. This movie didn't have that lasting impression on me.Even though my opinion is most likely contrary to every other movie watcher on here, I think that i have a valid point by saying that this moving brings nothing ""revolutionary"" to the table, and by that I mean that there is no part of this movie that leaves me teary eyed, laughing hysterically, or piece together a complex mystery. The movie is just... ehh...",Casablanca

I happen to be on the first side and I have to admit. if you watch ""Casablanca"", you may think that it's an other war-movie or you may be captured by the beauty of this movie and like it almost immediately.It's important though to have in mind the time when this movie first came out ( Whether you think it's important for a movie or not. ). 1942, the war was still in its peak. This movie, spotlights with the most beautiful of ways the circumstances of the war, the corruptness, the way people saw Nazi Germany and in the end, it lits a little spark of questioning ( Rarely executed subliminally well in movies. ): What is more important, oneself or the great good?I would recommend it, to anyone, who loves the essence of Cinema.",Casablanca

Many, even ""the classics"" do not--""42nd Street,"" ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" among others--feel dated, out of touch, irrelevant to my life. Yet ""Casablanca"" is different. There's something deeply human and personal about the story of Rick and Ilsa, and though even the most cynical viewer may be skeptical at first, one glance at Ingrid Bergman's downy and soulful eyes will dispel any doubts. Everything about this film is pretty much perfect--the script is THE Hollywood script, it is tightly paced and brilliantly plotted. Overall, a true classic that withstands the test of time.

Actually, the plot was not elusive but simple and beautiful. Ilsa, the beautiful girl, abandoned Rick for her husband but she had never forgotten Rick. Still remember when Ilsa met Rick again, she asked Sam to play the song as time goes by. It was that song brought them together and tore them apart. However, it was the greatest love of all. Though their bodies were separated, there hearts were attached together forever and ever. Although Ilsa left Rick again, they were never far from each other. The best lover never asked anything. The only thing they hope is the one that they love is in happiness. War was crucial and bestial. People sacrificed in the war, lovers departed from each other from the war.

As each scene elides into the next bringing twists and turns you are caught up in the swirl of an ambiguous world where money may talk but personalities talk louder. Whose side is Rick on? Was he the first anti-hero or just Humphrey Bogart's stock in trade character? The ambiguity of Rick is reflected in many of the other roles notably the young bar-girl revealed as deeply patriotic when the chips are down - for me the most charged scene in the film.No matter how many times I watch this movie it's still as fresh as the first time and the possibility of the ending being different always present.",Casablanca

Casablanca is, in my mind, the pinnacle of American cinema. It is rather depressing to go from Casablanca and look at what is coming out in theaters now-American cinema has really declined in quality since the age of Casablanca. Perhaps this is because the film industry was just starting out, and money could only be devoted to movies and ideas that really deserved it. Today, the film industry is so huge that even the trashiest films get funding and viewer time. The American Moviewatching Association ranks Casablanca #1 or 2 as the best American movie ever made, trading places every so often with Citizen Kane (another great classic). If you don't like Casablanca, either there is something really wrong in your head, or you have absolutely no taste. What a fantastic film!",Casablanca
1004,tupchurch,"fast paced, keeps you guessing, most quotable",10,29 May 2006,"Casablanca is among the most hyped movies of all time. The current generation of viewers who have never seen it will undoubtedly wonder what all the fuss is about. Could a movie that old really be that good? Typically in black-and-whites, the characters are stick-figures, the acting is stiff, the pace moves too slowly, the plot is predictable, the dialog is naive, the production is dated, and therefore the total package will be found lacking in excitement to today's generation. Casablanca has almost none of those traits.Indeed, the plot of Casablanca is as thick, as multi-layered, as timeless as any movie or play ever written. ""Shakespearean"" comes to mind as an adjective. It has drama, comedy, romance, history, mystery, and you can't guess what will happen next, much less how it will end.Also as in Shakespeare, the dialog of Casablanca is as quotable as it gets. One liners abound: ""Here's looking at you, kid"" -- is to movies what ""To be or not to be"" is to plays. And the best part is the one-liners come at you not once, twice, or three times, but repeatedly and frequently throughout the movie. Even the very last line is a memorable, quotable jewel for the ages.But it's more than the quotability factor that makes the dialog great. It's smart. It's so smart that it still sounds ""cool"" by 2006 standards.The acting in Casablanca, while stiffer that what the current generation sees in movies today, and the production, though Hollywood stage set, are good enough and convincing enough that it would be foolish to try to improve upon them by making a new version of the movie. The best that a modern production could do is borrow or steal from the original--parody it, even, to make something totally new--Indiana Jones being the prime example.Reviewers often use such superlatives as ""perfect"" or ""near perfect"" when describing Casablanca. They are correct to do so. Anyone watching this movie who finds serious and major flaws, or who gives it a thumbs down, is just not grounded in reality. They must lack a panoramic sense of movie history. . . or just plain history. Concerning movie history, it is not fair to hold a movie made in the 1940s to the exact same standard as a movie made in 2006. For its time, it was as get as they came; and it stands the test of time.Concerning just plain history, the viewer must have a basic understanding of World War II for the setting of Casablanca to make sense. One doesn't have to be super-knowledgeable about history, one just needs to understand that the Germans attacked France, the French government fell and then (under the name Vichy France) cooperated with the Nazis, but a strong French resistance continued to fight the Germans. Many people were dislocated by the war--some French, some Americans, some from every nationality. This film just happens to portray a few such characters--mostly regular Joe's and Jane's caught in the wrong place at the wrong time and thus stuck in the middle of nowhere in Morocco. Very believable from a historical perspective.Viewers who don't understand this basic outline of history may not ""get"" the movie the first time (my wife, 42, a very smart, educated RN, but who just ""don't know much about history,"" for example).Casablanca is, to repeat, one of the most hyped movies of all time.

1006,karllocker,War trumps love-a timeless message?,6,6 January 2019,"CASABLANCA is probably Hollywood's most famous, slickly made (but corny) WW 2 propaganda film, and it is somewhat amazing how decades of promotion have made people think it is a love story between Rick and Ilsa. It is a love story between Rick and his mercenary soldiering and how that love is rekindled.When we meet Rick he is running a club, but we are told that he used to fight fascists in Spain. When he meets Ilsa in Paris he has given up his military duties. She disappears and he is miserable, but he seems to have forgotten about it until she shows up.
But it is Victor who is the focus of Rick's attention. He admires Victor Lazlo--as a rebel leader. When Rick puts Ilsa on the plane, he says it plainly--Victor needs Ilsa for his work, and that is more important than their love. If Ilsa leaves Victor, it could lead to the fascists winning WW 2. Preventing that is more important to Rick.The message is in essence, war trumps love. In EL CID he gets married and then has to leave his wife to lead his men--but in that case, it is loyalty to his comrades and his nation--they ask him to lead him. Rick, on the other hand, is an international idealist--going to Spain to fight Franco had nothing to do with American patriotism. And we see in the story that money doesn't mean everything to him either.He remains committed to his anti-fascist beliefs, but he lacks the desire to get back into fighting--until he spends time with Lazlo. Ilsa is the catalyst for him realizing that fighting is more important to him than their love.It also seems that Ilsa loves Rick more than Victor--but Rick is telling her she has to stay with Victor out of duty to the war effort!Maybe this is why Renault comes across as the most genuine character. He is corrupt but compelled by self-interest. He changes sides like a pragmatist, and he likes Rick, so he can't turn him over to the Germans.

It is profoundly true, and this could be said of the ending of Casablanca also. Although Rick and Ilsa may well have said their very last goodbyes, the stories of these, and many other characters, in Casablanca are far from over at the 'end' of the film. What happened after Ilsa and Laszlo got on that plane? Did Louis and Rick's beautiful friendship last beyond the runway? And whatever happened to Sam? This is what makes Casablanca a truly unique film; you could make another three or four films about what happens to the characters after Louis and Rick walk off into the mist and it wouldn't get boring. It also gives Casablanca not just a great ending but one of the best in cinema history because it ties up the main story but leaves lots of other stories and questions unanswered before the events of the film as well as after like Rick's shady past in the US before he came to Casablanca.It shouldn't have worked though and how it did is still a mystery. The script was changed on a daily basis during shooting and many people, including Ingrid Bergman herself, thought the film was second-rate and nothing more. Still, almost seventy years on the film still remains among the favourites of film lovers around the World and at the pinnacle of many people's film collections, mine included. It manages to capture the fear, the suspense and the intensity of the situation in and around Europe at the time and how it reverberated to places like Casablanca and eventually, the World. It encapsulates the power of film that it can take us back to this corrupt, dangerous and unsure World and this again makes Casablanca stand out from the crowd as it does this with such power and conviction. It is no coincidence that it was shot during the war and so this also adds to the air of realism the film has to offer.Casablanca is one of those rare films that gets better with every watch. The pace of film is very much non-stop from the word go whilst the plot has many twists and turns, so it is almost inevitable that a first time viewer will miss something important or some of the smaller details that the film has to offer. On multiple viewings the film seems to become even darker and more cynical than I had thought before and yet it is still very uplifting in parts. In other words, it's a roller-coaster of a film. It needs to be seen if you have even a passing interest in film. It's one of the essentials and for good reason. Haven't seen it? Get watching!",Casablanca

Bogart at his absolute best. Great casting (reuniting Bogart, Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet, who played together so well in ' Tha Maltese Falcon', was brilliant). Absolutely one of my favorites. One of Bogart's most sympathetic characters, in one of the most quoted (and misquoted) movies of all-time. Simply fantastic movie-making from a great era in American cinema. This movie, and Bogart's character of 'Rick' most notably, are reminiscent of other great genres of American cinema of the time, like film noir and the hard-boiled detective story (of which Bogart was a mainstay at the time).

Now it is near impossible to find a movie that was made not for the money, not to win awards, but for the people.At first I thought that this movie was over hyped, but when I sat down and watched it, I realized that the hype was true. This movie delivered everything it promised and then some.The characters were perfect. Believable, realistic, and you felt like you could relate to them in a way. Humphrey Boggart was the best example. His witty yet sarcastic remarks are still known as some of the greatest lines of all time. My personal favorite being ""Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine."" While the movie did start out slow, it quickly picked up and was able to hold my interest. It was dark, yet was able to throw in light humor without upsetting the balance of a scene. Since it was dealing with a serious issue, which at the time was an incredibly important matter, they had to find a way to deal with the issue without upsetting the balance of the film. A feat that they managed to do well.There are many memorable scenes in the movie, but my personal favorite is the very end when Rick has to watch Llsa fly off. It is painful for him, but he knows that her staying would only hurt both of them and due to his character he is able to keep his emotions inept, while conveying in his new friend, Louis.As for changes, I would make none. This film is a masterpiece and wanting to make changes is like editing the Bible or adding finishes to one of Leonardo DaVinici's paintings. As the saying goes 'If it ain't broke don't fix it' I was only 12 when I first saw this film, but I gained much watching it. I learned that while you may not want to do something or say goodbye to someone sometimes it is necessary for the greater cause.This is a movie I would recommend to anyone who wants drama, romance, comedy, memorable dialogue, or just an all around good feeling.

That happened during the World War II.Casablanca is a important city for refugees who escape from France and other European cities due to German soldiers and occupants such as Nazi. Casablanca is a key to go to America so everyone try to get the visa to go there and escape from German occupants.Rick ,Richard, is a bar keeper in Casablanca. That bar is the most important bar in Casablanca so soldiers and refugees always come there to enjoy themselves or to do their jobs.Ilsa is a beautiful woman who is Victor's wife from Paris. Victor is the leader of France Resistance.During the early World War II, Victor is in the internment camp in Paris due to his behaviour and view about war. At that time, Ilsa and Victor are still loved each other and Ilsa read a new from newspaper is written ""Victor was died when try to escape the camp."" After that, she met a guy ,named ""Richard"" and really fell in love with him in Paris without Victor's issue.

I went into this movie expecting something good because of how many people (including my parents) said it was great and since it was up so high on the top 250 I had much confidence for it to be great.  I am only speaking honestly though when I say that it wasn't that good. I mean I guess I could say I enjoyed it and all. But I just don't see what everybody is so crazy about.  It had some good moments and all but what else was so good? I didn't even think Bogart was that good. This is the first Bogart movie I've seen though so maybe he has better performances. I just recently became interested in movies and I am trying to watch many of the really old greats.  I recently watched The Third Man, Ben-Hur, Gone With the Wind, and Lawrence of Arabia.  Comparing all of these to Casablanca, they are all better.  And Casablanca and Gone With the Wind are constantly feuded over and I have to say even though I didn't like the four hours of Gone With the Wind, it was still a better movie.  I mean I think saying number 6 is so wrong.  There is no way it could be number 6.

However, the year was 1942 and the subject matter and scenario in 'Casablanca' was quite the contemporary issue for that time. No one could know the events that would occur in the following years, as the world waged the brutal battles of World War II. Yet, out of the growing global chaos, Curtiz was able to direct a masterpiece that will continue to rank among the best films ever made. This is classic, quintessential ""Bogey"" at his very best. Starring as Rick Blaine, with his sharp, if not, brash style, Bogart gives such life to this character with incredible precision, that he's worthy to be remembered for the classic line ""Here's looking at you kid...""Matched with the stellar performances of the other cast members, this movie will always be an industry standard for it's brilliance and consuming style.

What kind of magic was worked during this film can only be guessed at. Some unique synergy took place on that Hollywood lot that has never happened since. An ensemble cast that could never be reassembled; craft masters and artisans at the peak of their skill; a world situation of uncertainty and worry, infecting the set with its tension and clarities.

1049,mhonorsenglish,One of the greatest movies ever made,10,5 April 2011,"This film is clearly one of the greatest of all time. It's genius lies in the perfectly delivered emotions of the actors. After years of playing gangsters and tough guys, Humphrey Bogart used Casablanca to establish himself as romantic lead, and cemented his place as one of the best actors of all time. He plays Rick Blaine, the bitter saloon keeper with a heart of gold, still madly in love with the one who got away. When she shows up in Casablanca, the passion between them reignites, but he learns that she is married to one of Nazi Germany's greatest enemies.Ingrid Bergman acts as Ilsa Lund, the wife of Victor Laszlo, an escaped enemy of the Third Reich. She arrives trying to find a way out of Casablanca, but meets Rick, and is torn between the two. In the end, both realize that they must sacrifice each other for the fight against the Nazis.The writing in Casablanca is superb. Many of the lines, ""Here's looking at you, kid"" or ""We'll always have Paris"" have become legendary. Casablanca holds the distinction of having the most quotes on the AFI's top 100 quotes list. The writing perfectly conveys the emotion and tension between these two characters, as well as the supporting actors.Many of cinema's most famous scenes are in Casablanca, including arguably the greatest scene of all time, the airport scene. In the final scene, Rick, Ilsa, Lazslo and Renault arrive at the fog-covered airport. Rick knows he and Ilsa love each other, but realize that in the end, they can never be together. He convinces her to join her husband and continue the fight. In the end, she agrees, and the two lovers part, assumingly, never to meet again.Casablanca stands as one of the greatest movies of all time simply because of the raw pure emotion that these actors brilliantly convey, a love that is real and true, but a love that can never be.",Casablanca

1052,chaser8491,Beyond good,10,1 July 2017,"While there's not anything new to be said about ""Casablanca"", it's good to see one of the classics still getting some attention. By most standards it is at least very good, and there are good reasons why so many still remember it so fondly. Not everyone who watches it today shares the opinion that it is a classic, but it's still good to see fans of modern movies giving it a try for themselves.The cast is one of its main strengths, not just Bogart and Bergman but also the fine supporting cast. Rains, Greenstreet, Lorre, and the others are indispensable to the atmosphere and the story, and each has some very good moments. It does have its imperfections, but it was not expected to be a classic or blockbuster - everything you read about the production suggests that it was made in a rather slap-dash fashion, under constraints that would have wrecked most other films. It's not hard to see the little ways that this affected the finished product, such as the times when the plot strains credibility a bit, or the characters seem to behave somewhat oddly. (In particular, it might have been even more satisfying if Bergman's character had been a little stronger - Ilsa is charming, but that's entirely thanks to what Bergman does with her; the character herself as written seems somewhat shallow.)But it turned out anyway to be an excellent combination of actors, characters, and story, a combination that more than makes up for everything else. Different viewers probably remember and enjoy ""Casablanca"" for different reasons, because it seemingly has a little of everything. While perhaps not perfect, it is well worth remembering and watching.",Casablanca

1055,b_rannells,Of All the Gin Joints. . . She Had to Walk Into Mine,8,30 September 2012,"The first thing that comes to mind when watching ""Casablanca"" is the elegance and simplicity allowing it to be a timeless classic. The movie has a peculiar magic to it, and it's in the richness of its details that the viewer finds them self engrossed. The director's use of foreshadowing makes those aha moments that come later on in the film even more exhilarating, and allow one to wonder if these events are happening within a 24 hour time frame. While it's fascinating to examine and dissect all that went into the making of Casablanca, the greatest pleasure anyone can achieve from this movie comes from simply watching it. There are several events that occur throughout the film that allow us to make generalizations because these little peculiars add up. One of the many events that stick out in my mind is every time the plane to America flies overhead, the refugees look up, their faces longing for escape from Hitler's tyrant rule. We're reminded that old Hollywood was populated with those fleeing from Europe, and the creases in their faces say more than any studio narration used to set the scene. The use of facial expressions sets a common tone displayed throughout the movies. Another form of symbolism one can draw is that Rick represents the image of America during World War II. Rick did not want to get involved in other individuals business much like our war tactics during this time. Towards the end of the film he has no choice but to get involved and make sure Ilsa gets on that plane out of Casablanca, representing the protection of Pearl Harbor. Much like those refugees at the start of the picture, his life experience is written on his face throughout the film. The use of music also plays an important role in building emotion through the movie. Rick's saloon sets an atmosphere of paranoia, exoticism, and liveliness, and then comes romance, in the form of piano player Sam's rendition of ""It Had to Be You."" The paranoia is a result of those individuals trying to obtain traveling papers so they can flee the country, the exotic rush from gambling at this speakeasy which allows for liveliness during a time of despair. The underlying message throughout the film is Rick's building relationship with Ilsa. The story takes place about a year after the Germans invaded France. Ilsa and her husband, Czech freedom fighter Victor Laszlo, wander into Rick's Cafe in Casablanca. Her husband's character feels more like an abstract idea rather than an image of freedom, unlike the letters of transit that allow people safe passage out of Casablanca which are concrete items. The two are on the run from the Nazis, and have come to the American-owned nightspot to lie low. But the German government is on the move, and Laszlo has to act quickly to get the letters of transit he came for, then escape. Little does Ilsa know that the café is run by Rick Blaine, the one true love of her life. When the two see each other, sparks fly, and memories of an enchanted time in Paris come flooding back. Through the use of flashbacks,we find out that Rick and Ilsa had a romantic experience in France and Ilsa leaves Rick with nothing but a broken heart and an extra train ticket. This draws us to conclude that this is a major struggle for Rick and may be the reason why he ""sticks his head out for nobody"". It's not much of a stretch to say that Hollywood doesn't make movies like this any more because the bittersweet ending is almost uncommon in today's society. If Casablanca was produced today, Rick and Ilsa would escape on the plane after avoiding a hail of gunfire from the police. Who knows what would have happened to Victor Laszlo, but he wouldn't have gotten the girl. One of the things that makes Casablanca unique is the way it stays true to itself without giving into crowd-pleasing tactics. And because of this, not despite it, Casablanca has become known as one of the greatest movies ever made.",Casablanca
1056,ctimmons-492-149018,A good movie,6,2 October 2012,"If you help someone that is in need not only will that person benefit from it, but you will too. Rick fell madly in love with a woman named Ilsa. Ilsa broke Ricks' heart which made Rick change. When Rick arrived at Casablanca, he bought a bar and in almost every scene, he was drinking. The way I saw it was he was trying to drink his sorrows away. Rick mainly cared about himself and he said that he does not stick his neck out for anyone and he would not help anyone out if he would get in trouble for doing so. Rick would also not get close to anyone probably for fear of getting hurt again. Rick did not socialize with others unless it was business. When people in the bar would ask to have a drink with him, they were told no because Rick did not drink with anyone. However, that changed when Ilsa arrived and she asked to have a drink with him, he sat down and had a drink with Ilsa and her husband. When Ilsa came to his bar, Rick started breaking all of his rules. Rick stuck his neck out even when there was a great danger of him getting trouble and he was getting close to Ilsa again. The writing of this story shows that one person can change the way someone thinks, feels, and acts. This is a good example of a love story. Two men were madly in love with a women and one man had to let the women go because he thought it would be the right thing to do. At the end of the movie, the man let her go because he wanted her to be happy, even if it was not with him. If I were to write a love story, I would use this movie as an example because it shows that you can love someone and risk your life for them and they are with someone else. Rick was given a very valuable object at the beginning of the movie and that was some letters. The letters were very valuable and Ilsa wanted them. Ilsa wanted the papers for several reasons. First, they meant freedom from the Nazis and from Casablanca because the letters meant they could get enough money to leave to make it to America. Second, they meant mobility because they were worth enough money for Ilsa and her husband to get on the plane to leave Casablanca. Lastly, the meant a new life in America because they were able to get on the plane to leave. In a way, Rick was like the Nazis. The Nazis were very powerful people and Rick was a powerful man. The French police told Rick that Islas' husband, Lazlo, was not allowed to leave Casablanca and whoever helped him escape would be in a lot of trouble. Rick had power because he had the papers that Ilsa and her husband needed to leave Casablanca. The Nazis sent Lazlo to a concentration camp where he was not able to leave and Rick had the power to make Lazlo not leave Casablanca.In the love stories I have seen, there is one person that sacrifices their happiness for the happiness of the person they love. Rick was still in love with Ilsa even though Ilsa was married to Lazlo. Rick could have made Isla and Lazlos' lives miserable by not helping them but, he wanted Ilsa to be happy so Rick helped them. Rick ended up losing his love again and risking everything he had and possibly his life. However, what Rick did for them made them happy.",Casablanca
1057,naim81,Casablanca isn't Casablanca without Humphrey and Ingrid!,10,22 July 2004,"Casablanca, starring the cool Humphrey Bogart and the angelic Ingrid Bergman is more than just a movie. It is a landmark film, transcends deep into American culture, and become the most popular motion picture of all the worlds of all the times. What makes Casablanca so popular? I can't explain it, so does everybody I supposed. I sincerely don't think that the pairing of Bogart and Bergman made them the best of all time. Bogart is better with his real life partner, and Bergman is far better with Cary Grant, her match in terms of good-looks and sexual tension. Nevertheless, Rick is Bogart's best role, the role really suited him. Bogart typically played smart, playful, courageous, tough, occasionally reckless characters who lived in a corrupt world, anchored by a hidden moral code. Rick seemed as cool as cucumber, but didn't dare to hear somebody played 'As Time Goes By'. Other than Casablanca, his best films are The Maltese Falcon and The Treasure of Sierra Madre. If you want to appreciate good acting, Bogart's Rick is the first to start. Ilsa is hardly Bergman's best role. She's more convincing as a tortured wife in Gaslight or an alcoholic woman in Hitchcock's Notorious. But when the most beautiful woman in the history of films played the role of Ilsa, Ilsa too had become the most beautiful female character in the history of cinema. I can't remember seeing a face more beautiful than hers; she is breathtaking, illuminating every scene. To watch Casablanca is to fall in love with Ingrid Bergman. Both Bogart and Bergman wanted to quit during filming, because they thought the story was ridiculous and unbelievable. Bergman was more critical, she hoped that nobody will ever screened Casablanca again after she died. The whole production was a chaos; nobody thought that they were making the best film of the 20th century. Bogart having problems with his third marriage, Bergman worried about her future role in her next film, the producers didn't know the ending yet and so on. For those who might think of remaking Casablanca, just forget it. For the greats Bogart and Bergman have long been dead, and for Casablanca isn't Casablanca without the two of them.",Casablanca

Nobody escapes the terrible script which is saved because I think the writer is trying to make this a comedy or a parody. A bit like Carry on Casablanca might be.

But not our manly Rick who replies with his highly interesting knowledge of tanks. The dialogue between Mr and Mrs Leuchtag. What watch - ten watch - such much - is typical of the dribble that is all through this film. I can't write but I know what a cringeworthy script is and this is one. Captain Renault has the highest proportional of bad one-liners though. I think he got his script out of some Christmas crackers. But there are plenty of great lines too so overall it carries itself through along with some great music and plenty of earnest overacting. I like the film - I just can't take it seriously. An 8.7 rating is only because there have been few too many sheep voting - it's great cinema, just not a very good film.",Casablanca
1060,Palymede-1,The Greatest Movie Ever Made!!!,10,13 January 2005,"Was there ever a better cast, better acted, better scripted film? The critic's can ooh and aah all they want over ""Citizen Kane,"" this film outstrips it in every respect. Bogie was never better than as Rick, Ingrid Bergman glowed as Ilse, Paul Henreid had a part to sink his teeth into as Laszlo, Conrad Veidt was appropriately menacing as Maj. Strasser and Claude Rains was simply superb as Capt. Renault. The film is loaded with classic lines and characters. Even down to the minor players, it was perfectly cast. Thank heavens that the original casting fell through. George Raft, fine actor though he was, could not have played Rick, Hedy Lamarr would not have been able to pull off Ilse, and it would have been even more dreadful if Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan had been cast.As it is, ""Casablanca"" is the greatest film ever made.",Casablanca
1061,marharri,"""A Brief Encounter in Casablanca?""",10,12 February 2005,"The classic second world-war film of love, separation, missed opportunity and uncertainty in a world whose order is collapsing with each day. This has more action than UK's ""Brief Encounter"", but the on-screen tension between the main male and female lead is just as intense (if not more so). They are both stories of people falling in love - who shouldn't fall in love, and as with all great films you have to wait until the final scenes to find out who gets the girl. Casablanca has much more humour than Brief Encounter, but then it was filmed a long, long way from any actual military conflict. An excellent film to watch on a winter's eve on a sofa with your favourite munchies and no visitors.",Casablanca
1062,gbjdna,The thing is...,5,16 December 2015,"Not as great as everyone says it is. But it's still pretty good. Bogart and Bergman ere nice. The writing is OK. Maybe I would've liked it more if not many people spoke so highly of it. Same goes for The Shawshank Redemption. Or Die Hard. Or Forrest Gump. People talk so much much about those movies and praise it to such a degree that anyone ho hasn't seen them gets these expectations to see one of the greatest movie of all time. I wouldn't call it one of the greatest, but I will say that it is required viewing for anyone who is interested in cinema. Just one of those movies that you need to watch, but no guarantee that you'll like. That kinda goes for every movie ever made. But hat can I say?",Casablanca
1063,TianLevMajdic,Fantastic film,7,28 June 2017,"Very entertaining and well paced, I sat through the whole thing without once checking the time and when it was over, i felt like the film was much shorter than it actually is. There isn't a scene that feels misplaced. The characters are well established and easy to grasp, the film does a wonderful job making you understand what everyone's relationship with everyone is. That is achieved through various filming techniques, such as characters being different heights to display their inferiority/superiority in a relationship, various clever angle uses, well written dialog and of course, great acting.The mood, i think, is set quite well, you can feel like you are in this Rick's saloon, there is really a lot of attention given to detail to make it a believable place.There wasn't, at least for me, any confusion as to what exactly is going on on the screen, which sometimes happens for me with some of these older movies, so that's a plus.At first, as I was watching the movie, I thought that the relationship between Rick and the girl didn't have much going for it, but when the film was over, I understood everything, where Rick stood, where the girl stood and where the other guy stood. It really just came together perfectly.The movie is pretty much without flaws, if we look past some minor exposition scenes, that are needed anyway.I was going to give it a 9, but after writing this review, I figured out I have no problems with it, so it's a 10.",Casablanca

1065,larkinadrienne,Favorite Of All Time,10,4 May 2015,"I am a 22 year old female, and I have no qualm in saying that Casablanca is my favorite of all time. And here is why. I did many a research paper on this cinematic gem. The reasons behind its success, the movie stars and their issues, the complete misunderstanding that they NEVER say ""Play it again, Sam"" (come on people, get it right) but nothing will ever speak to me as much as the nostalgia that comes with the Black and White motif and seeing Rick smoke a cigarette while playing craps as Sam plays ""As Time Goes By"". The softness of the movie, along with its Nationalistic overtones was so important to America is the WW2 times. It created soldiers so soon after the devastation of WW1. But besides that part of it, the love story of 2 who were so destined to be together that time could only keep them apart for so long. And the ending. Ah, the ending. That is my favorite. A man choosing to save the people he loves and cares for, more than save himself. What a groundbreaking and creative masterpiece.",Casablanca
1066,acvpvandebeek,Old but Gold,9,29 May 2016,"Ah Rick Blaine the lone wolf who runs a respected saloon and he doesn't worry about anyone or anything. The way he's played is great and you can clearly see that he's respected by everyone that visits his saloon. I personally think that's his dialogue is one of the best there is, it's a bit comical yet very just. He's the kind of guy that you'd follow orders from regardless what they were, he has that kind of influence on the others in the movie.But our Rick also has a soft spot and this is for Ilsa Lund, his former lover, and when they meet again he'll do everything to help her and her husband Victor Laszlo from escaping Casablanca and going to Lisbon, like so many others would like to.Seeing an old black and white movie really made me want to watch more of this genre and I'll surely will. This movie is a classic and even now I find this to be one of the better movies that there is, old but gold really applies to this one.",Casablanca
1067,woverstreet-87702,Doesn't hold up to hype,4,2 March 2017,"I was thoroughly excited to see this movie because of all the positive reviews I've heard about it in the past. However, this movie in no way lives up to the hype. Everyone hails it as an undisputed masterpiece, but compared to the many movies that have come out after and even before it, this movie doesn't stand strong. The acting was stale, the characters were un-relatable, and the story was drug out too long. I found myself bored throughout at least 80% of it. Please don't assume that I don't like it just because it's an older film; most movies I have scene are older films, and a lot of them are far better than this one. Believe me, I wanted to love this film, but I just couldn't. Even if it was ""great"" for its time, that doesn't mean that it's great for this time. However, I will say that there were a few memorable lines, and some parts that were better than the rest, but other than that a cliché filled snoozer.",Casablanca
1068,faidrapunk,the perfect model of classic design narrative,10,4 December 2020,"Its no secret that Casablanca is a great film.its a near perfect movie in every aspect. Passing through all those reasons though, its core is how authentic it is concerning the classic design model of narrative and how it uses that devotion to a tight plot in its advantage.in spite of that its not at all standard.But how so?Well ,it puts in the bin many elements that would later become the standard but somehow never a given.First of all plot and themes go along fro the start.The motives that make the characters act are very clear no matter how complicated or simple they are.They are not a mystery as it is the case with many films nowadays.In that way it achieves real substance,which of course is combined with impeccable style.
The dialogue is very discreet and full of subtext.That way the film spices up and it becomes more clever than most films today.All the lines seem really suited to the characters and thus organic.
Acting is of course top notch and very ahead of it time.Bogey gives Rick a poetry between the lines just with his eyes.He really keeps the balance between the suave and confident guy and the beaten dissapointed in romanticism man.The way he performs is not typical of that era its more suited to the the realism of the seventees.Ingrid is perfect in playin a beautiful but very deep young woman.She really does justice to this great,conflicted character who wants who of course has the beliefs of a mature individual.She doesnt just seat around thinking about the way to make the world better,she acts on it.At the same time she is very conflicted about her feelings.Ilsa is one of the first truly strong but real female characters to come out of hollywood.As far as the other actors are concerned they all give great supportive performances from Petter Lorre to claude rains and Dooley Wilson as Sam.
Now that i have fineshed talking about the obvious greatness of the movie i wanna adress the thing that struck me the most in my last viewing of the film.All that devotion to the classical model and the clear application of the structure on the tree act model allows the movie to flirt with some elements that transcend it.The cinematography for instance is very similar to noir fimls which adds an extra layer to the film.That element progresses the themes in the sense that it compliments the characters at any given moment.That being said the story doesnt have many of the usual tropes of noir film but it really makes it more complex.The flashback sequence is anther thing which is less convential than usual.Flashnacks dont always work but in this instance its really reavealing and it comes in the right moment.Its a film that crosses genres and with the very unique and iconic elements such as the ending or the screenplay overall for that matter it deserves a place in the hall of fame of masterpieces.
In this review i wanted to avoid literary language because i wanted to talk about the things that really hit me in this last viewing i had the other day.The gist of what i talked about is that its a film that really made an impact because its not typical in its conservative narrative.In other words ,although its a perfect example of the strengths of the classical model it turns around or it uses many elements that a true piece of art.",Casablanca
1069,granpoobstar,Brilliant and Riveting,10,12 August 2016,"OK, I admit it, I'm a sucker for all things Bogart. No, not all his movies stand out as masterpieces but among the actors who epitomize the Golden Age of Cinema, Bogart is at or near the top. That having been said, Casablanca stands apart. The story perfectly captures the complications and confusing ideals of the time. There are some characters who are clearly on the wrong side of good vs evil but so many of them (just like in life) are caught somewhere in the middle. Knowing what is right, and, doing what is right, becomes complicated. Casablanca is riveting cinema and stands as one of the top movies of all time. As with so many Golden Age movies, the acting is incredible and the pace is spot on. If you haven't seen this wartime classic, it's a must.",Casablanca
1070,taye_talbot,One of the best American films ever made,10,14 December 2005,"Casablanca is certainly one of the best and admired American films ever made. A subtle yet enthralling adventure set against the backdrop of World War II in Morrocco, it simultaneously plays as a romance film, an exotic intrigue film, and a wartime drama. However, the sum of it's parts produce a film that eludes straightforward classification.Directed by the talented Hungarian director Michael Curtiz and shot almost entirely on studio sets, the film moves quickly through a surprisingly tightly constructed plot, in spite of the fact that the script was written each day as it was filmed and no one-not even the director-knew the ending. Curtiz debated up until the last day of filming who would use the two exit visas in order to escape. Apparently three weeks after the principal shooting ended, the producer Hal Wallis contributed the famous final line, and the last shot was taken on a fog-shrouded runway.Casablanca is such a flawless film and a testament to the fundamentals of film-making, cinematic narrative, acting, directing, and editing, it is inconceivable that it could ever be remade.",Casablanca

From opportunists, to isolationists - from patriots to disenchanted lovers - the film has everything a man or woman would enjoy.  Bravery, courage, intrigue, romance, beauty and love. Leading actors to please any appetite.  Watching this film is to step back to a world that doesn't exist - yet to know it.  It is to experience lives that have never been lived - but are ""real to you.""  It is to know pain and joy, pride and pity for characters that are a fiction - yet are so real that you can't help but get lost in their story.Amazing cast, memorable dialogue, unforgettable story.

So, if Boogie Nights, Pulp Fiction, Swingers and Usual Suspects round out my top 5, why does Casablanca a B/W, 1942 romance movie take the cake?I could rant about the acting, script, story, direction and so on and so on. Its been done. Its the magic of the movie that makes it so great, not movie magic in general just the specific magic this movie emits each and every viewing.

I'll bet you saw Titanic more than twice in the theaters, too...)This is often called a war movie, but don't be fooled -- it's even less about war than Gone With the Wind, which is to say that there *is* a war happening, but it's largely irrelevant as a plot contrivance (which, incidentally, is entirely inaccurate from a historical prospective.  There was no such thing as a letter of transit).In essence, a glorified chick-flick which will hopefully fall away into nostalgic obscurity as my generation continually thrusts spectacular films by Kubrick (may he rest in peace), Fincher (well, Fight Club and Seven, anyway)and Ridley into the forefront.",Casablanca
1093,mivince79,A tale of the burnt out idealist and the redemption of his soul.,10,7 July 2000,"Casablanca is an enduring epic about the indomitability of the human spirit. Beside the obvious charisma and passion of the leading actors, Bogart and Bergman, it is also a glorious tale about the human condition. It is a tale about idealism, and idealism gone stale. It is a tale of greed, fear, resignation, smugness, indifference, and re-birth. In short, this is a monumental film about the vortex of human emotions that make up life as we know it, day in and day out.Bogart and Bergman elude an electricity and a tension that permeates the entire drama. But these brilliant performances are enhanced by the wonderful supporting cast of real, down to earth, ""just plain folks"" character actors of the day. In their stellar performances we see Everyman: the idealists; the hopeful and the hopeless; the greedy, the needy, the brutal sadists, and the tender hearted. It is ourselves we see in the craggy faces which surround Rick and Ilsa. Unfortunately, we no longer see such faces in today's cinema. For it was their genuine ""ordinariness"" which shone so brilliantly from the screen, that grabbed us so tightly and swept us up into the turmoil of the story. It was the plainness of these supporting characters that framed the swirling epic raging round them, so unlike today's performers, who seemed to have stepped out from the pages of Elle and GQ with their polished good looks and vacuous performances.Casablanca is also an epic tale of the burnt out idealist in all of us who have pulled against the grain, but who, like Rick, have lost once too often. It is the tale of the twentieth-century. It is about a man who has spent all he had to spend, whose spirit which once burned with the fiery idealism of youth, is now but a flicker, only to be re-ignited once again by a lost love. It is an idealism rekindled by memories of joy and heartache, of a love lost and now regained--for a brief moment. For Rick is like all of us, far from perfect. In the deepest recesses of his heart, there is a war raging, one which rocks him to the very depths. The better angels of his long suppressed idealism struggle with his cynicism, his burning desire and his passion to be reunited once more with Ilsa, his first and only love. The good of the many takes precedence over the good of the one. It was that spirit that characterized the times, times long past and long forgotten. But times, nevertheless, whose idealism and generosity of spirit are sorely missing from our world today.",Casablanca

At 60+ years of age the dialog is still a thing of beauty - quick, funny, cutting. Rick casually cuts down important figures of the community with the briefest of comments. Watching this movie today you are instantly reminded of other modern classics, but then you have to know that this one launched them all. The dialog of Pulp Fiction - comedic banter about topics ranging from foot rubs to french cheese burgers are interspersed with scenes of high drama - how different is it here when you are looking at the possible collapse of a city at the hands of the Nazi's in the midst of WWII. Rick: Your cash is good at the bar. Banker: What? Do you know who I am? Rick: I do. You're lucky the bar's open to you. Woman: What makes saloon keepers so snobbish? Banker: Perhaps if you told him I ran the second largest banking house in Amsterdam. Carl: Second largest? That wouldn't impress Rick. The leading banker in Amsterdam is now the pastry chef in our kitchen. Concepts of ""rounding up the usual suspects"", ""of all the gin joints"", ""This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" have been parodied, stolen re-used and homaged in many good films since. This film was mad during the height of WWII - it is not a look back at the Nazi horrors - it takes on the Nazi's head on. The scene where they sing the French national song is terribly moving in 2005 - imagine what it would have been like in 1942.Watch the film again and think of how many films it reminds you of and realize that this was the film that helped make those others possible.",Casablanca

There have been many bars with various names connected to ""Casablanca"" but they are all shams. ""Sixty Minutes"" on CBS did a segment on the movie with Harry Reasoner reporting.

1101,Brodieman808,THE Greatest Movie Ever Made,10,13 July 2006,"Arguably the greatest film ever made. It is a classic for a reason, this film tells a great story, tells a love story and is a political commentary at the same time, all while being supremely entertaining.From start to finish this movie continues to pull you in, and makes remarkable references to world events at the time. You are introduced to Rick, played by the legendary Humphrey Bogart, an American who ""sticks his neck out for nobody"" but who was fought bravely in the past against the same type of enemy the other characters are up against. This is clearly a singular personification of the history and the stance America had in 1941 prior to Pearl Harbor. Early in the story we see the keys to salvation handed over to him by Ugarte, played by Jewish actor Peter Lorre, who himself fled from the Nazi's in 1933 to come to America. Ugarte who is killed summarily early on in the story is something of a representative of the heartless horrors that Jewish refugees were telling of what was happening to Jews in Nazi Europe at the time. Rick is now the safeguard of ""letters of transit"" which play an important role and overall become a character in their own.Taking place in what can only be described as purgatory we are introduced to a host of characters that need help to get out and the ones that prey on those needing that help. In this place the Vichy French, under influence of the Nazi's rule the land, and their prefect, the corrupt but still somehow noble in a way, Captain Renault, who becomes a representative of all French who wish to be free of Nazi rule, mainly because he doesn't like being told what to do more than anything. It is into this we see the great conflict as Victor Laslo, a legendary Czech freedom fighter against Nazi rule is brought into the story. Victor becomes a representative of all of Europe that needs the help of America, and as the singular American in the story, speaking for all of us he seeks out Rick, who now holds the key to Victors, and his wife's freedom. With the introduction of Victor Laslo we meet his wife Ilsa Lund, played by Ingrid Bergman, who we learn has had a past with Rick, a past that has scarred them both, but their feelings still remain. Here we see the American past with Europe personified, we have a past with that continent and most of us love that past but we want our own future and now our past love needs our help, so Rick has to come to the rescue. This relationship is summed up in one line Ilsa says to Rick ""you have to think for both of us, for all of us"" where we see the desperation and the need for salvation.The climax to the movie is a masterful one, where a race to get Victor and Ilsa on the last plane out of Casablanca is taking place, where Rick has weaved a web of decit that bravely ensures they will get out alive if all goes according to plan. Prior to their escape one of the most famous monologues takes place that almost brings tears to the eyes of all who see it. And after the dust has settled Rick, the American, and Captain Renault the Frenchmen who has realigned his allegiances and saved Rick from the Nazi's walk off into the foggy night in what is ""the beginning of a beautiful friendship"" where side by side the Americans will stand with the French against the Nazi's.In the end we see it as a highly critical editorial commentary made by Warner Brothers of the stance America had before entering the war. It also stands as a noble and optimistic beacon for events to come.",Casablanca

The first few scenes are quite slow and boring but as the storyline becomes clearer it becomes more interesting and I found I really enjoyed it in the end. It was interesting to learn about all the different film techniques used throughout the movie. The girl who played Ilsa Lundt was quite a bad actress in this movie in my opinion. As a history student also, it was very interesting to see through the eyes of people living during this period of time, the use of lighting and camera angles is dominant in this film.

I don't know that much of his personal life, but his contribution the classic days of movies is undeniable. Casablanca should be required watching in film school. The films now a day just seem to descend into gratuitous violence, sex and profanity. Each film seems to need to out do the previous when it comes to explosions. Some films makers should look back and review the classics like Casablanca and maybe be a renegade film maker and not give in to the Holly Wood lowered expectations. Mr. Bogart's delivery of sarcasm is second to none. And what he had to do for the woman he loved in the move. His to classic lines that still resonate even to this day, usually miss quoted, but there are still here. 1943 is long gone and the world has moved on, we have new dangers in the world, but the fad in movies is use bigger guns that expel more bullets.

1113,nancy_the_bitch,General Comments on Casablanca,8,18 February 2008,"I thought this film was good, but yet still it didn't live up to the hype that surrounds it. Everyone always writes about Casablanca with a romantic view, that it is one of the best 'Classic Hollywood' films made, yet I thought that at times it could be slightly slow and dull.For example all the main action takes place in Rick's Café Américain, which modern viewers, especially the younger generations, will find odd and it can seem boring. As we are used to action packed films where the scenery changes every few minutes and this seems very theatrical as most plays are set in the one place and this has the consistent setting of the bar and the fact that the main part of the action takes place here, makes it seem rather monotonous. This was proved, by one of my friends at least, by the fact that she fell asleep during it.There are also elements of historical inaccuracy, as looking back at the film now and knowing what we know about what happened in the concentration camps and Europe under Nazi rule, it seems that even if Lazlo had managed to escape from one of the concentration camps, he wouldn't have looked as healthy as he does in the film. This again goes back to the fact that as a younger viewer, I find that now actors are more likely to change their appearances for their film roles, even losing vast amounts of weight. For example, as Christian Bale lost weight for his role in 'The Machinist', yet Paul Henreid didn't lose the weight to look like a concentration camp survivor.The film is often seen as one of the most romantic films for longer than the last half a century. The romantic content is unusual, in the sense that in modern films, the couple spend the entire film trying find the other, before finally getting together at the end of the film. However, in this film, the couple have already been together and spilt up before the film has even begun (although you do see this relationship in flashbacks). Another point that makes this aspect of the film unusual is that this couple are separated at the end, where Rick tells Ilsa that they cannot be together and that she would regret it ""for the rest of (her) life"" if she didn't leave with Lazlo. So, as the main couple don't get together at the end of the film, it is different to many of the modern 'greats' in the romantic genre.However, overall apart from the differences between modern Hollywood films and Classic Hollywood films, making it, in my opinion, slightly dull at certain points during the film it was still much better than a lot of modern films.",Casablanca
1114,zenzenzen,Hilarious,1,24 April 2007,"I'm always baffled by the way that this film is held in such high esteem. Is this because it's old? Maybe it's because it's in black and white? Whatever the reason, it's certainly not because it's a great film. In fact this is one of the funniest films I've ever seen. Wooden acting by wooden actors on wooden sets, (what about that ridiculous cardboard aeroplane? LOL). Forget what people say about this movie. Ignore the romantic gushing. Why? Because it's just plain rubbish. It's not even good enough to be labelled a 'B' movie. Quite possibly it's a 'C' movie, if there is such a thing.

Casablanca is the ultimate classic, and that's a fact. From its memorable and ever-repeated quotes to Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, all the way through its music (the enduring As Time Goes By), the postcard scenes and the mix between a drama about the always attractive Nazi subject and occasional ironic jokes. How could we ever forget the scene in the airport, ""Play it, Sam"", ""Here's looking at you, kid"", ""We'll always have Paris"", ""Round up all the usual suspects"" and ""This is the beginning of a beautiful friendship""? We never will, not only because of what they represent, but because we'll keep on hearing them and watching them in every movie, TV show, book and every single artistic expression. Casablanca marked a before and after in art history and opened a whole new theme in it. In fact, every Hollywood movie we watch has some element of Casablanca, and it will always be like that. Every movie heroine is, in some way, Ilsa, and every movie hero has something of Rick in him, as well as every movie love story has something of theirs. But all this doesn't mean at all that this is a cliché, and that's because this one started it all. Casablanca will endure in time and will always be in our hearts and memories. That's why it's a classic. It is where it all started. I'm sixteen years old, I absolutely LOVE this movie, I cry every time I watch it. This movie is for all audiences.",Casablanca

Was it the director, Michael Curtiz? Was it the black and White photography, was it Dooley Wilson's haunting voice. Was it the superb casting? Who knows? but to think of anyone else playing the roles would have been insanity. Another Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, Conrad Veidt, Bogart or Bergman. Impossible.About four years ago I was travelling around south-east Asia and in Phnom Penh (in Cambodia) and one night I went to the Foreign Correspondants club. It was my birthday and I was on my own so I stayed for a few drinks. I then found out that the club was showing THE ORIGINAL Casablanca. The benches the audience sat on were wooden.

This film was not intended to be a classic.  What happened?  One can watch this movie without sound and marvel at the human struggle in northern Africa. Did Michael Curtiz perfect his directorial technique during the silent film era?  Obviously his silent film experience is evident.  Why watch Casablanca with the sound off?  One would miss the orchestration by Max Steiner and vocal by Arthur Dooley.  The dialogue is very rich, the plot compelling and acting perfect.

The dialog in this film blows so many modern films out of the water, being at the same time witty, in some cases laugh out loud funny, and powerful. It's amazing how many of its iconic lines have become permanently engraved in film history. This is only the third film I've seen of Bogart's but he continues to impress each time.

The relationship between a young star struck Elsa in learning to love her underground hero husband. her pain at learning of his death. Her finding love in a new man - Bogey. And her distress at learning her husband was still alive and needed her. It all made up for the pain felt by Bogey at being left in the rain at the train station with her dear John letter dripping away.

I read things such as ""Ilsa is seen almost jumping out of the plane to get to Rick"".. and i think ""did you actually watch the movie? or did you want to just say you didn't like it because everyone else does?"" You should really watch it before you write down comments about that make you seem like a child. Sure, some people don't like it because of the accents, the black and white, or for their reasons, but a lot of people do and you sound stupid talking about things that never happened in the movie. Black and white is okay in movies, there are a lot of good black and white movies, and a lot were made when colour was around but they wanted the effect of black and white.

1128,sara-coy71,The best thing about Casablanca **SPOILERS**,10,14 March 2009,"To me, the best thing about Casablanca is that every character (except for Strasser) ends up doing what is best for the others. Every character makes a sacrifice so that the others are better off.Renault does the right thing for Rick, even though Renault will have to give up his comfortable position.Ferrari does the right thing for Victor and Ilsa, although there is nothing in it for himself.Victor is willing to give up Ilsa to his rival in order to insure her safety.Rick does the right thing for Victor (and the larger cause), even though it means giving up Ilsa.Ilsa also does the right thing for Victor, but she loses Rick because of it.In fact, the Rick-Ilsa-Victor storyline is the most mature representation of a love triangle I have ever seen on film. Even though it is clear that the Rick-Ilsa relationship is the more passionate, it is impossible to cheer for her to leave Victor. When Victor goes to Rick's and pleads with Rick to use the letters of transit for Rick and Ilsa to escape, even Rick sees that Victor is not just a hero or an iconic symbol - he is truly a good person.",Casablanca
1129,awilkinson05,"""As Time Goes By...""",10,14 February 2010,"As the film's theme song so aptly observes, things change as time goes by. People, politics, relationships- none of these are safe from the passage of time. This is never truer than in the fictional story that takes place in one Moroccan city of a 1942 masterpiece. In Casablanca, this concept is exemplified expertly in a timeless classic directed by Michael Curtiz.The story centers on the reunion of two ex-lovers and how their past relationship fits into their present circumstances. In the city of Casablanca, Rick (Humphrey Bogart) is living his life lightly and superficially, making no personal connections to anyone, as is fittingly demonstrated by a character-defining line in the beginning of the movie 'I stick my neck out for nobody'. He's seemingly satisfied with this unfulfilling existence when a ghost from his past (Ingrid Bergman) walks back into his life (and into his bar) with her new prestigious husband, Victor Laszlo. Rick is surprised and unhinged at her sudden presence, and Ilsa obviously is as well. The couple is there to escape the World War II Nazi Germany, but cannot leave without Rick's help. Old feelings must be faced, and life altering choices made before anyone can enjoy a happily ever after.The title this movie has earned as one of the greatest of all time is not earned easily, nor given lightly. Greatness is found in the dialogue, acting, camera shots, etc. My personal favorite aspect is the dialogue. The film is surprisingly funny, in all the back-and-forth lines delivered with a perfect dose of dry humor, such as Rick's response to his file ('Are my eyes really brown?"") and Renault's feigned outrage (""I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on here""). The peppering of these well-delivered lines throughout the film really makes the movie for me. The writing is terrific, and almost every line is memorable. I also admire the depth of each character. Rick at first appears to be a cool, selfish bar owner, but we see that he is actually just a broken-hearted man, and 'a rank sentimentalist'. Ilsa as a character is layered and mysterious. She is conflicted- neither the audience, nor the woman herself, can tell which man she loves most. We never know through what she tells us, rather the answer is gleaned from significant looks and body language.That especially is an excellent facet of Casablanca- the subtlety. Much of the plot is derived from facial expressions and what is found behind a character's words or actions rather than their face value appearance. For example, Ugarte hints to Rick that he killed the German couriers in order to obtain the transit letter. In response to Ugarte's earlier question, Rick says ""You're right, Ugarte. I am a little more impressed with you"" -his tone of disgust in this line is slight, but significant. Or at the conclusion of the film, Ilsa is to board a plane with one of the men. It turns out to be Victor. She never says which man she wants it to be, but as she walks away she turns her head to look at Rick one last time and we can clearly see the answer. These moments and many like them exhibit the unassuming skill of the film.I have only just touched on a few of the many great merits of Casablanca. It is a fantastic film, and I understand why it has earned so many raving reviews over the years. It's now one of my favorites and I know it's one I will watch again and again. The movie appeals to a broad audience- from film experts to average movie watchers, it is accessible and enjoyable. This appeal extends across generations, as it has survived all these years and will for many more to come. Maybe some things don't change. As time goes by, indeed.",Casablanca
1130,thepointlife23,This is look to kid-Casablanca,7,15 March 2010,"Before watching Casablanca I had a small idea what the movie was about but not truly sure of the whole movie. Once I watch it I liked it.The plot is about a bar owner named Rick played by Humphrey Bogart who once live in New York City. After running from the Germans in France he ended up in Casablanca. Were he runs a bar that many powerful people come in to and business is talked about. Rick is kind of the leader if the mafia leader. People end up in Casablanca to try to get away back to in America. Many powerful people come in to place and try to get Rick to sit down and talk to them, but he never does till one day he hears a song that has not heard since France. This is doing to a long lost friend that he never thought he would anymore. Ilsa Ricks love in the movie is on here way to try to find a way to get out of Casablanca and back to New York. She just needs the help of Rick to do it.This puts Rick in a hard spot. With all that is going on with Llsa and her friend Victor brings out the try style of him.This movie uses a lot of music to build the mood and show you the mood. Its show the mood of the characters or scene that is taking place . Since the movie was in black and white there uses a lot of dark lighting or light lighting to show good or bad people. As well as misty or even love. For the 40's it is well done and can compare to today's movies. The made it looks like love. They love. Over all this is a great movie that draws you in from the begin to the end. You never really know what is going to be coming around the corner. You think you have a clue what is going to happened then it changes on you before think you figured it out. I know understand why this is an American classic and I would tell any more to watch it. If you wanted to know what kind of movie them it is I would say it's a suspenseful drama. Not a lot of action but still keeps you on drown in to the movie.

This is one of the few WW II movies that shows the ambiguous feelings of American towards the war. It is kind of amazing that such feeling could be shown in a movie that was made while the war was actually being fought and the outcome not known. Many people forget that WW II was often called ""Roosevelt's War"" before and shortly after it was started.Nick is shown as an American who is in the midst of trying to determine what to do about it. He clearly detests the Nazis but does not feel the need to fight them. The love of his life comes back and he wonders if he can get her back or even if he should. The Vichy French are shown struggling with their desire for revenge and their subservience to the Nazis. This struggle is at the heart of the movie and shows its greatness.",Casablanca

I'm not sure, but as one of my favorite films, I'll give it a try. Most of the film Casablanca takes place in Rick's Café Americain – a nightclub in the Moroccan city of Casablanca that lends itself to people looking for a way to escape the Nazis; these can include refugees, gamblers, even crooks. Rick's is owned by Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart). Rick has gone to Casablanca to escape the Nazi's, a lost love and ""sticks his neck out for no one."" The plot centers on some letters of transit that have been given to Rick for safe keeping. The letters will allow the bearer to escape to the United States, and freedom. Unknown to Rick is that these papers are the reason that his lost love Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman) and her husband Victor (Paul Henreid) find their way into Rick's nightclub. Rick is torn between using the papers for him to get out of Casablanca and take Ilsa with him, or give the papers to the couple, so that they can escape the Nazis. Also central to the story line is the song As Time Goes By, a song that was special to Ilsa and Rick during their romance in Paris. Rick has forbid Sam (Dooley Wilson) his piano player to play the song since Ilsa left him alone at the train station in Paris. When Ilsa and Victor come into the club, Ilsa convinces Sam to ""Play It Again Sam, Play It Again."" When Rick hears it, he is furious, until he sees who requested the song. Thus begins the revival of Rick and Ilsa's love affair. Even though by today's standards the scenery and special effects are outdated and at times seem corny, it doesn't detract from the charm, romance, mystery and allure of the story of the film. The lighting and camera angles used to shoot the film contribute to the mystery and allure of the city of Casablanca as well. This can specifically be seen in the lighting and camera angles used for the close-ups of Ilsa. The soft, diffused lighting on her face, gives her an almost angelic quality. The emotions are so evident in her expressions, especially her eyes. While watching this film, the lighting used, reminded me of another of Ingrid Bergman's later films, The Bells of St. Mary's. The lighting used seemed to be similar, and in The Bells of St. Mary's, Ms. Bergman played a nun, so she was angelic in a way. I found that the film Casablanca still held the same allure, mystery and romantic adventure after viewing it for the 20th time as it held the first time.",Casablanca
1133,stefan_epangeac,The best movie ever made,10,22 June 2013,"For me, the 40s and the 70s are are my favorite movie periods. I should include the 30s also. It is the period of the greatest scripts, they are great even in our days, and also the period of the coolest actors ever to appear on screen. Humphrey Bogart is one of them, and Casablanca is the film that shined most in the 40s. Casablanca has the best script including legendary lines i think 6 of them are included in AFI top 100 lines. It' not just a love story, it's that love story that seems impossible, due to the time when the characters met, and the circumstances in witch they feel in love. Probably, the best scene in the movie is the one with ""la Marseillaise"". It has such deep signification, it's the French national anthem played in a French region in Africa under German occupation during WW II, played while the Germans sang a patriotic song. The scene is presented in great detail, from the beginning, where the band look to Bogart for his approval, to Victor Laszlo' hand gestures and Ilsa's heavy breathing suggesting that she is proud of Laszlo's intention, to the end when a a woman in the crowd with a visible tear shouts ""Vive La France"". The song starts in a shy matter for the French crowd, but it increases immediately and the German are forced to stop singing because they can not be heard anymore. It has the meaning of freedom, of liberty. When you watch this scene you feel good, you think of what the public though when it was first released; back then the war was still on; maybe they though that the war will be over that the good will eventually conquer evil. To conclude, watch this movie, you will love it, you will love the French anthem scene even if you are not French. You will not find a better script or better actors.",Casablanca

It has a timeless quality that makes the film watchable even though you may know the plot and some of the dialogue off by heart.

I really can't explain why but, to me, ""Casablanca"" is the best.Casting, direction, lighting. Bogart as Rick, Ingrid as Ilsa, that pairing was perfect. Rains as the Captain, Sydney Greenstreet was perfect as Ferrari and who of the time would have been better than Henreid as Victor Laszlo.

I feel the same way about ""Casablanca."" I think it has a much better story line than ""Citizen Kane"" and it didn't need inovative camera shots to make it a truely unique movie experience. And, it has some of the best dialoge ever written in a movie. Ex. Strasser: Why did you come to Casablanca? Rick:      I came for the waters. Strasser: This is the desert! Rick:      I was misinformed.Score one for Rick!They don't write them like that any more!",Casablanca

Some try to argue that Casablanca is a good movie for its time, so it is a classic. But I really can't imagine that people were that stupid back then. Casablanca is really not much better that Gladiator (which was pretty bad).
I wish people would stop believing that old movies are good. It's just something producers do to get you to buy movies. Not that all old movies are bad. On the Waterfront is a really good movie, but Casablanca is just another mediocre Curtz film. So stop pushing it at me.",Casablanca

The story line was good. The acting wasn't corny like other films around this time. After awhile you forget your watching a black and white movie. It might not seem that good at the beginning but don't just shut it off really watch it and trust me you will get into it. I didn't think I would but I did. This is a romantic film. The main guy is very much kept to himself he doesn't let himself get to close to anyone he has one best friend and that's it. Later on in the film it explains why he's like that but you got to watch the movie.,Casablanca

1143,callirose102,Social and Emotional Relevance,9,27 September 2011,"Casablanca has long been referred to as one of ""The greatest movies of all time."" With the help of an awe-inspiring cast, this film directed by Michael Curtiz really strikes a chord in the hearts of the American people. In my opinion, this is for two reasons; its social relevance and emotional, relatable characters.Casablanca was filmed during a period of political indecision. At this time, America was struggling in its decision to enter WWII, and I believe it was Warner Bros. intention to stir the American public to action. Rick's slow build up to Ilsa's reluctant hero is a strong representation of America's decision to uphold those virtues our country holds dear: Courage, justice, and sacrifice. This rings especially true in today's post 9/11 society, which, like the attack on Pearl Harbor, ignited our decision to enter the war.It is easy for people to see pieces of themselves reflected in the emotional struggle of Rick and Ilsa. I believe most men can relate to the stoic, jaded, yet innately sensitive rogue that Humphrey Bogart portrays. Likewise, Ingrid Bergman represents a noble woman of conviction, who gives her whole heart to those she loves. I cannot think of another actor in the same era who could deliver the level of performance displayed by Ingrid Bergman. Everyone who has ever loved and lost feels the tear she sheds during ""As time goes by"". The sacrificial love of Rick and Ilsa is that of which any romantic would claim to aspire to.Overall, I do not find it surprising that Casablanca is movie that has stood the test of time, and it is my belief that its popularity will never die.",Casablanca
1144,UMTigers1,A great love movie,9,19 June 2004,"After watching this movie by myself, I have decided that if I was ever to watch this with a woman I definitely would win some major points. This is one of the best movies ever. Although it starts off slow, you really get into it. I have never seen such an excellent portrayal of forbidden love between two lovers. How could Bogart just walk away! I know I never could.This movie really makes you associate with the characters and really become involved with them. I can't count how many times I became angry when she wouldn't just leave with Bogart. If you like great love movies or just great movies in general, this movie is for you. And guys, it wouldn't hurt to watch this with a special someone.",Casablanca
1145,Cone70,Awensome movie,10,4 February 2015,"So this is my favorite movie, first no-color movie. I read somewhere that most of dialogs in movie are improvised by main actors Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart. Very good acting and we can miss that, this movie won a Oscar. A lot of good music in the movie. Most of them are played by famous Sam (Dooley Wilson)a Rick(Humphrey Bogart) and Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) favorite piano player.Rick i a typical character played by Bogart. He's a a womanizer,funny, well-dressed guy who own a bar in Casablanca (Morocco. A lot of guys want a life like him.I watch this movie about 10 times, and always i get surprised by this masterpiece. Most of people can said that this is just overrated movie, but when you see how this movie is significant for industry of film. There is nobody how saw this movie and said to me that his expecting more from this, because there is no more this is the all that movie can give you. Replicas from this movie you can hear everywhere. From this sentence you can see that Casablanca is a MASTERPIECE",Casablanca
1146,nscmovieguyj,BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!!!!,10,2 January 2004,"There is no doubt in my mind that Casablanca is the best movie ever made. Its absence of flaws and abundance of excelences makes this movie irrisitably good. The chemistry between Bogart and Bergman only adds to this films excellence.  Also, the comedic relief in a somewhat dark plot from Claude Rains and Peter Lorre never fails to amaze me.  Many people say that Citizen Kane is a better movie, but that film, although excellent, does not have the quality that Casablanca does.  What I mean by that is most people know numerous lines and scenes from Casablanca(some who haven't even seen the movie) and I frequently hear it quoted n everyday conversation.  I cannot say the same for Citizen Kane. The combination of these elements makes the perfect formula for the greatest movie ever made, CASABLANCA!!!!",Casablanca
1147,grifhody,Still one of the best,10,9 January 2004,"This movie remains simply as one of the best of all time.

1148,FourStarFilmFan,Casablanca (1942),10,22 May 2013,"Considered one of the greatest films of all-time this well-loved classic deserves to be here. It is the hallmark of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman's careers. It has one of the greatest scripts of all time and it has achieved legendary status over the years. Many consider it purely the best film ever made and in all honesty, I would never try to refute that. This film holds such a tremendous presence in movie history it is amazing. Upon seeing the movie it made complete sense what all the hype was about. What more could you want than Bogey, Bergman, Casablanca, and some of the greatest quotes ever said? Do not forget the the French Captain Louis played by Claude Rains or the immortal tune of As Time Goes By. This movie has conflict and the uncertainty of war practically in every scene. We have a rogue gallery of everybody under the sun from Peter Lorre and Sidney Greenstreet to German soldiers. There is a broken romance and a forlorn hero who shows his courage in the end. If you take into consideration when this movie was made, it truly is wonderful to watch. You do not need explosions and violence only great characters and a story with both drama and humor. Up until the final moments of the movie you are captivated the entire time. Then fittingly you are left with the two men walking off into the night with the words, ""Louis I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.""",Casablanca

1150,Jules_Winfield_,Awesome,10,21 June 2004,"A perfect example of how a great script carries the movie through along with the most apt choice of actors. Bogart is brilliant and Bergman is arguably the most beautiful actress to have graced the silver screen. Bogart's characteristic dialogue delivery coupled with a well matched background score add to the atmosphere of a romance gone bad in the midst of the war. The genius of Casablanca lies in the fact that instead of introducing many characters, the makers of the movie have concentrated on just a few and developed them completely in the movie. At the end you feel as if you know Bogart, Bergman, the French detective and even Sam, the piano player. One of the best movies ever made - only to be matched 53 years later by the greatest movie of all time - Pulp Fiction.",Casablanca

I'm writing this having just gone to see it with my sweetie at a packed-house Valentine's Day showing in a restored classic movie palace. If you ever have the chance to see a beautiful print of this film on a really big screen in such a venue, with an audience totally in love with it, DO NOT DO NOT DO NOT pass up the opportunity! When people used to refer to the ""silver screen,"" it's this movie and a few others that they were talking about--it literally shimmers like finely wrought silver.Oh yes, the other greatest American film?

1153,orlandini,A true masterpiece,10,6 April 2021,"Casablanca surprised me in several ways. I watched this wonderful movie almost a hundred times and got to memorize some lines. Humphrey Bogart, Paul Henreid and Ingrid Bergman, take us on a journey through time to Vichy France, occupied by Nazi Germany in World War II. It is worth seeing and reviewing to try to better understand what happened in that France invaded and violated by Nazism, which did so much harm at that time and causes controversy to the present.",Casablanca
1154,vickramjsingh,Great Film,10,28 July 2013,"This film is great because it gives the viewer a look into a period in history through the eyes of an ordinary man, a hero, a soldier, a woman and someone in love. It is simple and yet impossible to grasp at times and can be watched over and over again. The actors play their roles amazingly and leave the viewer speechless at times. This is one love story that can never be pushed to the side as a chick flick because any guy would like this movie as well. A real masterpiece in cinema. Personally, I appreciate and enjoy movies that are simple and not too long, but they still leave you breathless and wanting to watch them again when they are finished. Casablanca is a great movie that allows the viewer to personally take a stake in the plot and watch as events leave them sad, horrified, heartbroken and elated at the same time. I would recommend this movie to anyone of all ages.",Casablanca

It always amazes me what moods and shades the directors and cameramen could create with black-and-white. (The only good thing about seeing the colorized version is that I had never before realized that the thing hanging on the wall in Capt. Renault's office is a map of Africa.) If I ever own a bar, it will be called ""La Belle Aurore"".Much as I love Bogie and Bergman, my favorite actor in the movie is Clusde Rains. He gets very few gags, but he's the perfect straight man for the zingers written for Bogie.",Casablanca
1156,arobs91393,A Perfect Example of the Golden Age of Film,9,18 February 2013,"Adam Roberts ENGL 110 MA 1 Kopplin Due 2/19/13 CasablancaThere was a time when movies did not have to be gory or intricately produced to score big at the box office. Though some will say that time has since passed, it is always nice to look back at how the modern movie scene came to be. Perhaps one of the finest movies of the mid-20th century exemplifying early movie styles is Michael Curtiz's Casablanca. If it were to be released today, many modern movie goers would shrug it off as ""old grandpa crap"". However, due in part to its portrayal of refugee lifestyle, direction, and unique take on current events, it cannot be argued that Casablanca has earned its place among the early classics.The very thing that puts Casablanca in a unique position is its borrowing of the current state of political turmoil that existed in the early 1940s and making a side story to it. Many actors were refugees from Europe who had come to America to escape the German Reich. The cast features such top-notch actors as Ingrid Bergman, who plays the tender Ilsa, and the star Humphrey Bogart as Rick, a bitter and sarcastic club owner who can't quite let go of past love. It is clear from watching that every viewpoint is shared in the story; each refugee shares a different look on how the events of the time affected them. The mix of French, German, Austrian, American, Czech, Hungarian, and even Moroccan refugees adds a sort of cohesion to the movie; it is telling a tale of the 1940s human experience. The setting of World War Two is quite honestly not the greatest setting for a love story, yet at the same time Curtiz sees a prime opportunity. The theme of sacrifice, one of the common ideas behind true love, is notably present in Bogart's character. Curtiz looks at the picture as a series of moral dilemmas that need solving one at a time, starting with Rick overcoming his disgust with Ilsa. It shows a passion for revealing a character's interior struggles one at a time. Warner Brothers had a knack for mass producing movies during the Second World War to entertain citizens during a time of great emotional toil. Casablanca captures the attitude that many held during wartime, but wraps these views around the central plot of a love story. Love is hard to find in a war environment, and in the end Rick has to allow common sense to overtake his emotions, but in a way this is the greatest show of love in the entire film. ""Here's looking at you, kid"". It is one of the most recognizable quotes from a highly recognizable movie. In a time when everybody desires to get what they want when they want it, maybe some of us should examine what it means to sacrifice for the greater good.",Casablanca

His artful dissection of the film--the centerpiece of his presentation--served only to increase my admiration for its many levels of significance. Its narrative design, its psychological subtlety, and its effectiveness as propaganda early in World War II make this a film that offers new insights with each new viewing. Like great literature, its richness remains superlative but never superfluous, and its economy of expression articulate, not taciturn. When I occasionally teach scenes from the film in theater and literature classes, students often note how even very minor characters with only a few lines achieve a presence that exceeds their roles. For many of my students, ""Casablanca"" becomes the beginning of a ""beautiful friendship"" with their own capacities for appreciating the kind of artistic integrity it embodies.",Casablanca

The theme is just as important today as it was then and perhaps this is the reason it is a timeless classic.

I was very fortunate in the fact that, despite the fact I am only 14, I was able to see this movie in the theater the first time i saw it. It is an amazing movie and I recommend it for anyone and everyone no matter what age. Also, the special edition DVD has excellent extra features that everyone will love. The timeless coupling of Ingrid and Bogart is amazing, the chemistry is so real. The timeless lines are also some of the most amazing ever written.

Humphrey Bogart is outstanding, as is Ingid Bergman, and Claude Rains goes beyond almost anything I could imagine. One scene in particular stands out, in which a number of drunken German officers are singing a German anthem very loudly. People just stand and watch them, not daring to anything about it, but obviously not pleased. Then Victor Laszlo decides that he has had enough of this, and instructs the band to play Les Marseilles (please excuse my probably incorrect spelling), the French anthem. After a nod from Rick, the band starts up, and Victor begins singing it at the top of his voice. All the rest of the café joins in, and it swells to such a noise, that the Germans can no longer be heard, and they promptly sit down, looking angry.

It had been awarded numerous Oscar Academy Awards and nominations which bring up its value. It is a special love story that is rare in modern times, where love is ready to be sacrificed for greater things in a world that hasn't changed much - Where money still makes the laws. Love is the thing that can make you survive, and win your battles, you could really feel this tense atmosphere in the movie.The actors who made this film a success had tremendously superb screenplay, leaving us with some memorable and touching lines such as ""Round up the usual suspects"" and ""We'll always have Paris"", it made me feel sad with these words and the emotions on Ilsa and Rick's face.Another thing you must pay attention to is the movie song ""As time goes by"", I loved the way they used the song whenever they could throughout the whole movie, and when Sam played the song, the expressions on Ingrid Berman and Humphrey Bogart's faces showed the sadness and struggle of their memories together through that song. It was also so relieved to see that Rick's Cafe had so many connections and Rick was quite kind in some situations such as helping the young Bulgarian couple. The influence of people, money and the will of leaving Casablanca was so strongly demonstrated in the Cafe.I deeply ensure that this movie will last as time goes by for generations to view: We'll always have Casablanca...",Casablanca

The power of each and every emotion through this film is simply amazing. Since then, I saw this masterpiece five or six times and every time I watched it, whether alone or with friends, I found something new, something different, something great... The brilliance of Casablanca is undisputed, and the Humprey Bogart's character, Rick Blaine -- the greatest ever. I mean, to do what he did... It's unbelievable! He is a definition of a great man.

1166,thejmpolo,A nice recollection,9,26 October 2018,"Casablanca is this type of movies that do not make anybody indifferent, of those that were remaining in your recollection forever. A precious history in times of war. A former romance that it remains in the hearts of those who cannot forget. The one who has not loved ever and to the time it could not have continued with the promises that once he said? Since this way it is Casablanca, which happened was the better of our life, but the time happens and everything ends.
"" Always we will still have Paris "" says to him Rick (H. Bogart) to Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) this when it is going to divide towards America. A Paris that stays as this recollection that they have not forgotten throughout the years, a Paris that retains the love that was had and that there remained. Difficult what is ... truth? During the existence of the human this being it limits itself to promising things that in occasions it cannot fulfill, falls in love, looks for a reason by which to remain entertained until the sad end, that end that comes to all without differentiating any alive being of this planet, the death. "" Since the time happens "" he says the song that there touches Sam (D. Wilson) for Ilsa, it forms a of seeing that the facts of the present will transform in recollections of the future and when the death finally comes, it will be the recollection of us themselves what it will remain.
The presence on screen of H. Bogart is indisputable, becomes big in chamber and his action performs the better thing that transmits great classic this one, there is no way of resisting turn fascinated by his interpretation. His place is cozy and important in the plot. In fact, in this place it is where a scene takes place praises of great meaning. The German officials sing a military march and other clients of the bar remain quiet, listening until Lazslo (P. Henreid) sees what happens. It is admirable as Víctor, in this moment of supremacy Nazi, decides to intone the Of Marseilles one and the whole bar joins him, silencing to the German voices. An anthem for the freedom, the equality and the brotherhood.
Definitively, Casablanca is of the best movies that there offers us the wide range of the classic cinema and, since I have mentioned previously, it will remain always strictly between ourselves, will remain as what is, a nice recollection.",Casablanca
1167,scottihoe,Bergman. Bogart. As Time Goes By. Word: Priceless,1,16 April 2005,"Casablanca is want so many claim to be the best of all time. Whenever I listen to this movie and I hear ""As Time Goes By"", I start to blubber. The script, direction, and camera work is absolutely amazing. Bergman and Bogart were amazing also and looked like they were meant for their parts. I found it so gripping when they were on screen together. What a dynamic duo. The story between Rick and Ilsa was so compelling in every way. The story also led into the narrative of Victor Laszlo (Henreid) and Sam (played by the superb Dooley Wilson who sang ""As Time Goes By""). Another great part of the movie was in Rick's bar club where Ilsa and Rick met again in Casablanca. But as far as the songs, plot and characters go, I thought the utmost part of the movie that made me think ""wow"" was without a doubt the ending. The ending was so action-packed and heart-pounding it almost took my breath away.Overall, Casablanca is a timeless classic that will never go by our minds.",Casablanca
1168,alexscarfe,There is a reason it is a classic,10,1 September 2014,"I saw Casablanca in my senior film class in high school and I almost at a instant I fell in love with it. This movie is fantastic and needs to be watched by everyone. The acting is one of kind and still holds up today the sheer notion of this movie being outdated is crazy. This film also has great dialog and scenes, you could cut out any bit of this movie and it would standalone very well.The soundtrack is one of a kind it is a huge driving force for the movie and it really helps it out. All in all this is one of the best movies of all time and if you have not seen it yet go and watch it now. Its a one of a kind movie with a one of a kind cast.",Casablanca
1169,JohnnyAces,Timeless Romance,10,19 June 2014,"In the days of my youth I merely thought CASABLANCA was a wonderful movie -- exciting, hopelessly romantic and very satisfying. Humphrey Bogart was the man who more than any other I wanted to be and who, in occasional fantasies, I imagined I was. Ingrid Bergman was the woman I wanted to love and protect from all dangers. At first, Paul Henreid did not really fit into my calculations. The idea of the noble sacrifice was quite new to me then, but I caught on quickly and, having toyed with the idea that Henreid instead of Bogart should have gone off to Brazzaville with Claude Rains, I realized that things had to work out as they did, and I felt better for accepting the fact.A half-century later, I love CASABLANCA not a whit less, probably even more because, like all the movies we loved in our youth, it now carries a rich frosting of personal associations and a sweet melancholy, born of the intimations of mortality -- the viewer's own, confirmed as it were by the passage of the film's wondrous stars.And, after a half-century, I can see CASABLANCA, at least a little more objectively, as the apotheosis of the Hollywood romantic melodrama, a kind of fearless and perfected make-believe that you probably couldn't get away with today. Singing the Marseillaise in the face of the snarling Gestapo men! As I am frequently told (as if it were somehow my fault), they don't make movies like that any more. It's true, they don't, and I explain sadly that it's because they don't make the world the way they used to, either. Romantic idealism doesn't come as easily as once it did. Information, and rather too much of it, has led us toward being, in Oscar Wilde's formulation, cynics who know the price of everything and the value of nothing. We can't play make-believe the way we used to, and the loss is ours. Out of wartime reality, Howard Koch and the Epstein brothers, Philip and Julius, constructed a beautiful, tragic, heroic dream and no small part of its appeal now is that it arose and reflected the world in which things seemed to be simpler and clearer. (Whether they were or not is irrelevant.)Thirty viewings later (at least), I still can't watch only a little of CASABLANCA; I have to stay aboard until Brazzaville. And I can't watch any of it without a tightening of the throat and a hint of moisture in the eyes, sighing for the kind of immortality the movies provide their stars and the savor they lend to our more transient lives.",Casablanca

1171,marcheroffaith,Casablanca- A classic movie that must be seen,7,24 May 2005,"Casablanca is included on the list of the top ten movies that everyone should see in their lifetime. This is a classic movie that is loved by many. The plot and genre is very appealing to many people and I believe that Casablanca is definitely worth seeing.The plot of Casablanca is a classic love story and focuses on a women torn between two men. This plot has been demonstrated in many other movies and books, but it is presented especially well in this film. Even for people who do not enjoy a good love story, this movie is still appealing. It takes place in Africa during World War II and can appeal to audiences who enjoy films in this setting. The plot depicts the trouble that people went through to come to America and be free during this time. Overall, Casablanca is attractive to all audiences and is accepted as a classic movie.To enhance the excellent plot of the film, director Michael Curtiz used many filming techniques to make the movie more appealing. The cast was carefully chosen and the actors and actresses did a very good job in depicting the characters that they played. While the film is older and there are not many special effects, Casablanca is still appealing to younger audiences today due to the plot, cast, and other techniques.Many other filming techniques used in Casablanca that help to enhance the movie include the use of sets, scenes, shots, and lighting. All of these characteristics must be present to make a good film and all are apparent in Casablanca. The lighting in the movie is especially well done to enhance the mood of each scene. Without even listening to the dialogue, a movie viewer is able to decide the mood being conveyed through the lighting of the set.Flashbacks are also an important part of this film. Instead of starting the plot in France when Ilsa and Rick first met, the writers began it when the lovers met a second time in Casablanca. Effective flashbacks were used to show the past and make the movie more interesting. Through the use of fading from one time to another, the film has more excitement and keeps a readers attention.Overall, Casablanca is an excellent film that should definitely be seen. The movie uses many good techniques to appeal to viewers and is a classic love story and war video.",Casablanca

How great to own your own bar, have a cool reputation for cynicism and dry wit, and most of all, have a desirable woman so in love with you she's ready to leave her war hero husband for you if you just snap your fingers. Of course, it's even better to be Rick, when he makes the great sacrifice of putting her on the plane with her husband. Ahhh, sit back, have a smoke.But why on earth do women like this? Ilsa is a completely passive, spineless thing who stands around sipping drinks while the men make all her decisions for her. What a total lack of moral courage, to let someone else determine whether or not she leaves her husband? Even the mix-up in Paris seems rather lacking in initiative on her part -- couldn't she have made some excuse to slip out long enough to send a telegram to the train station? I didn't even enjoy identifying with Ingrid Bergman's fabled beauty, because, frankly, without the soft focus lens she's just a round faced, thin lipped woman with a jutting nose.I love old movies, the ones made in the forties are my favorites. Paul Henried, Claude Raines and Bette Davis were wonderful together in ""Now Voyager."" Barbara Stanwyck made dozens of great movies during those years. Joan Crawford and Lana Turner played strong women. Gene Tierney and Hedy Lamar were breathtaking beauties.

It is WWII and Casablanca is a haven for refugees who are escaping the stronghold of the Nazi military in eastern Europe. Escapees are willing to do whatever it takes to Get from Eastern Europe to Casablanca, Morocco to Lisbon, Portugal and finally, to absolute freedom in America. Rick's Americain Cafe is a hotbed of political corruption and refugee deal making in the tumultuous city of Casablanca.Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman the ingenious screen writing of the Epsteins and Koch cannot be overlooked I am not going to waste your time by going any further with the plot summary of this movie but I will say that with each time I see this phenomenon of a movie I am more and more amazed by the screen writing of Philip and Julius Epstein with Howard Koch. Incredible as the performances that are given by Peter Lorre(Ugarte), Claude Rains (Capt. Renault), Paul Henried (Victor Laszlo),",Casablanca
1180,auloren,Beyond classic,10,23 June 2017,"Spoilers ahead, but then again, who isn't familiar with Casablanca, even if one hasn't seen it?I've been watching 'Casablanca' over and over again since I bought the Special Edition DVD, and is there any film out there one can watch again and again without ever being tired of it? And does any film appeal to a broader audience? Just everything about it seems to be as close to perfection as it only can be.But what exactly is so special about it? Is it its great genre mix, never equaled by another film? When we think of 'Casablanca' first, we remember it as a romantic film (well, most of us do). But then again, its also a drama involving terror, murder and flight. One can call it a character study, centering on Rick. And there are quite a few moments of comedic delight, just think of the pickpocket (""This place is full of vultures, vultures everywhere!"") or the elderly couple on the last evening before their emigration to the US (""What watch?"").But 'Casablanca' is not only great as a whole, it still stands on top if we break it apart and look at single lines of dialog, scenes or performances alone. Is there any other film which has more quotable dialog than 'Casablanca'? 'Pulp Fiction' is on my mind here, and 'All About Eve' and 'Sunset Blvd.' come close, too, but still I think 'Casablanca' tops everything else. And not only is the dialog great, it's unforgettably delivered, especially by Humphrey Bogart (""I was misinformed."") and Claude Rains (""I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on here""). Many of scenes have become a part of film history; the duel of 'Die Wacht am Rhein' and 'La Marseillaise' is probably one of the greatest scenes ever shot (the only I can think of that would rival it for the #1 spot is Hynkel and the globe from Chaplin's 'The Great Dictator'), and the last scene is probably even familiar to the few people who've never seen 'Casablanca'. Am I the only one who is absolutely convinced that the film wouldn't have become what it is today if Rick and Ilsa would have ended up as the lucky couple?About the performances: So much has been said about the uniqueness of Humphrey Bogart's and Ingrid Bergman's chemistry as Rick and Ilsa, about Claude Rains' terrific turn as Renault, about the scene-stealing performances by Peter Lorre (one of the 10 all-time greatest actors) as Ugarte and Sydney Greenstreet as Ferrari and about Dooley Wilson stopping the show as Sam. I'd love to emphasize here two other performances, one that is not mentioned quite as often and one which is blatantly overlooked: Conrad Veidt as Major Strasser had a really difficult task here, as his character is the only evil one, but still Strasser is not a one-dimensional character, and it took more than 50 years until another actor gave an equally (maybe even more) impressive performance as a Nazi, Ralph Fiennes in 'Schindler's List'. But why no one ever mentions S. K. Sakall, who plays Carl, the jolly waiter at Rick's Café Américain, is beyond me. He has definitely more screen time than Lorre, Greenstreet and Wilson, and probably about as much as Veidt, and he's a joy whenever he's on the screen. I simply love his reaction when the pickpocket (""Vultures everywhere!"") accidentally bumps into him, or the reaction to the ""What watch""-dialog. Or how he says he gave Strasser the best table, ""being a German, he would have taken it anyway"". His performance is simply criminally overlooked.So is there a weakest link in 'Casablanca'? Every film, no matter how close to perfection, has a minor flaw or two, so one can find them in 'Casablanca', too, if one really tries hard. So yes, one might ask how much sense the entire mumbo jumbo about the letters of transit makes. One might point out that Paul Henreid, although his performance is certainly good, doesn't come close to the greatness of any of his co-stars. However, the film is so close to perfection that I'm almost ashamed that I'm so desperately trying to find less-than-perfect elements.So whatever films will come, how many sequels will overflow the screen, and how much junk we will have to sit through, one thing is certain if we're desperate to see a great film: We'll always have Casablanca!",Casablanca

And how romantic is Ingrid Bergman's remark in Paris: ""Are those the bombs or is it my heart beating?"". I believe the feelings of a woman in love are so wonderfully said in one sentence. Repeating all those statements will be boring here. The high voters will know them all.

So quintessential, so replayed, again and again and again (Sam)?This is a myth, an archetype, a riddle.For my money this is Oedipus Rex. I like Freud, hell. Indeed it is better than Freud or Sophocles, but it is dealing with the same issue. Dad: Lazlo Mum: Ilsa Son: RickThe love triangle that repeats in our culture forever is played out perfectly in this movie. Rick and Ilsa had the perfect relationship, before them Nazi's arrived. Man and woman before the arrival of oppression, rules, the crunch. They lived, in the permanent idyllic past of Paris. A Paris always in spring. No need for anything there except love. Champagne every day. No promises. But we, viewers, live in a real world. We need ideals. We may reject the signs, we may live in a Morocco of our dreams, but that only leads to an alcoholic, moratorium. Victor Lazlo bit the bullet. He is the man. The man that Rick has not, at the beginning of the movie, become. Were it not for the ultimate hard boiled machismo of Humphrey Bogart, this film would have been unbearable. A drunken sop, hoping to take someone's, a hero's, wife? Yuck. But Humphrey does show us the dilemma. The unachievableness of bliss. Of going out with a yes saying, ""okay anything goes"", woman, other, mother. So much for Freud. But what about Lacan? Jacques Lacan tells us another Oedipal story via Edgar Allen Poe's ""purloined letter."" Personally I don't understand Lacan at all. But Casablanca is the story that makes me want to. Why does this drama center upon a stolen letter? Why does the letter have to reach is destination?Where is the letter in my, our, life? What letter am I preventing from reaching its destination?Watch this movie many times! The answer is here!",Casablanca
1186,mike_bartosinski,"visually stunning, a legacy of film",10,19 October 2005,"Casablanca Every time I watch this film every other film makes so much more sense. Over the years Casablanca has been referenced in more films then I can count, everything from the Muppets and film to the Simpson's and television. I thought it was interesting that the entire film was shot in studio except the one scene at the start when Major Strasser arrives. This probably has something to do with the director Michael Curtiz who filmed primarily in the studio throughout his carrier, as well this was the common way movies were made in the early times of film. Michael Curtiz, a renowned Hungarian filmmaker, began his carrier in Hungary and Austria making silent films He later immigrated to America in 1926 and began a lavish carrier in Hollywood were he directed over 100 films including; Captain Blood (1935), The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), The Sea Wolf (1941), Mildred Pierce (1945), White Christmas (1954), and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1960) to list a few. He has directed ever genre imaginable and is consistently one of the greatest directors of the 20th century. The story Casablanca originated from the play ""everybody comes to Rick's"" by Murray Burnett & Joan Alison. It was later revised by Julius J. Epstein & Philip G. Epstein, who added more elements of comedy to the story. Later Howard Koch began writing for the film in conjunction with the Epstein twins, Koch highlighted the political and melodramatic elements of the story. As well the unaccredited Casey Robinson added some important scenes. I felt that because so many people worked and contributed to the script it formed a balance of genres it mixed comedy, romance, drama, and politics. Each writer wanted to do something different with the script and when they all collaborated together we sort of got the best of what everyone had to offer. The director of photography on Casablanca was Arthur Edeson, who is well known as one of the founders of the American Society of Cinematographers. He is known for his work in film such as The Maltese Falcon (1941), Sergeant York (1941), and Frankenstein. Edeson is considered a pioneer of film and was one of the first to film a major wide-screen feature, The Big Trail (1930). Edeson enjoyed experimenting with light and different techniques. The dark film noir and expressionist lighting is evident in several scenes throughout Casablanca, particularly towards the end. When I watch the film the way the whole thing is lit and shot is fantastic the precision to details especially, for example in some shots throughout the film bars of shadows fall across the background and characters faces. This likely indicates their imprisonment, and emotional turmoil. It's details like this that makes Edeson one of the greatest DoP's in the 20th century, and makes Casablanca a masterpiece. One of my favorite parts of the film is were the Germans start singing ""Die Wacht Am Rhein"" and the French begin the sing Marseillaise I felt that was the most powerful scene in the film. I thought it was amazing because it combined music and visuals perfectly, as well the French Marseillaise was played by an entire orchestra not just a small band like in Rich's café the powerful music combined with the great camera work really captures and emphasizes the first time the Germans get defeated by Laszlo possibly foreshadowing the end of the film. Music is always an important part in film you can take a great film but with the wrong music it just doesn't work I felt the score in Casablanca, by max Steiner, fit perfectly. The casting for this film was excellent I could not imagine anyone else as the main roles in this film. Humphrey Bogart is perfect for this role; the chemistry between him and the lead actress Ingrid Bergman makes this story come to life. I find that dramas are always tricky to do you can have all the best filmmakers in the world but without good actors you can't have a good drama. Casablanca combined good actors with superb filmmakers to create an everlasting classic. Casablanca is a part of film-making and that's the truth you can hate the movie or love it, but it will always be one of the greatest films of the 20th century. I would recommend this film to every filmmaker because even if you don't like the story, the film itself is such an important part of film history that it is a necessity to watch. I think this is a great film more for the technical aspects of the film then the actual story, which I find a little dry and uninteresting. Overall I enjoy this film every time I watch it, and I am sure I will watch it again.",Casablanca

Maybe Bogart was simply Bogart.What can I say about this film that hasn't been said in over 60 years since its release. Is it a great film? Yes. Is it a showcase for Bogart? If not, than what else. Was Bogart the coolest guy to ever live? Absolutely. Casablanca is a different kind of love story, more likely to infect rather than effect.She almost makes me believe it every time. When she says, ""You're very kind."" Bergman was more than just beautiful. And with Paul Henreid, Claude Rains, Conrad Veidt and Peter Lorre, cinema magic was created. But to me, Bogart was the greatest actor of all time. It's hard for me to believe he died almost 50 years ago. Every time I watch his films, it's like they were made yesterday. And that's why he is timeless. I'm still trying to figure him out.""I should never have switched from scotch to martinis."" Is said to be Bogart's last words. A legend, indeed.",Casablanca

The only reason I ever seriously considered smoking (my grandfather got lung cancer from smoking) was because Bogart looked so cool smoking. I grew up hearing lines from this movie, not knowing where they came from, so that when I finally saw this movie I was left, with regards to those famous lines, wondering whether the movie originated those lines or whether they were originated before the movie was produced---------""Here's lookin' at you kid.""
