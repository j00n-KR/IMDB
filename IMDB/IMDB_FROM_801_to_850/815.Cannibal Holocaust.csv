0,Leofwine_draca,Everything you've heard is true,8,21 December 2015,"Ruggero Deodato's repulsive masterpiece in horror is probably the most controversial horror film in existence. I've heard and read about it for about five years before finally sitting down and watching the uncut version; the delay was through my own fear of not having a strong enough stomach to be able to sit through the endless scenes of barbarity and sadism. The film strongly divides audiences and I too am divided in my opinion of it; as a piece of ""entertainment"" it doesn't work at all, because the downbeat nature of the narrative and the graphic gore can hardly be enjoyed. But then the film must work as a ""horror"" film, a true ""horror"" film that can evoke feelings of anger, disgust, even sickness and fear. Undoubtedly the novel filming methods (after the deliberately slow pacing of the initial set-up, the latter half of the movie becomes a mock documentary as in THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, and just as horrifying) make it the best of its bunch and the most effective of them all. It's the only cannibal film that comes close to resembling a mondo movie, and the final events involving the student film-makers are truly and horribly believable. The only way to watch this film is to live the lie, and the result is a challenging and disturbing but somehow rewarding viewing experience.The movie is professionally made in that the filming seems unprofessional, lacking gloss and shine, and therefore more realistic; the various expeditions into the jungle simply convey the humid atmosphere, the constant danger from deadly wildlife and hidden tribes. The first half of the film is slowly paced and gradually builds up to the horror, with glimpses at a maggoty skeleton (the camera zooms into the grub-infested eye sockets of the rotting skull) and a tribal rape which is effectively powerful stuff. However, in comparison to the last half an hour, this is child's play. The supposedly real video footage shot by the students is harrowing and disturbing, but doesn't engage the senses as much as one might think - mainly because the students themselves are far worse than the cannibal tribes they seek! Their actions are a catalogue of torture, rape and even worse, as they impale an innocent girl on a spike (a painfully realistic - but simple - special effect) and burn down a whole native village for the hell of it, actions which of course act as a catalyst for the ugly conclusion.Every five minutes something pops up which is likely to offend or shock a viewer somewhere, whether it be graphic moments of sexual violence (possibly the hardest parts of the film to sit through, or at least the most uncomfortable) or cheap but realistic gore effects of people having their legs sliced off and the like. The cannibal antics of the finale are the most powerful part of the film, as the film-makers keep on shooting for the love of their documentary. This is as horrible as the film gets and will have most viewers breaking out in a cold sweat. Blurring the border between fantasy and reality, CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST includes a segment of real news footage showing Africans getting burnt and shot which is very hard to watch.Harder still to stomach are the scenes of animal cruelty (the bane of this particular genre). Nobody can enjoy watching such scenes but they do add considerably to the film's false reputation of being a ""snuff"" movie and their inclusion adds to the powerful impact that the film has on viewers.Production-wise, the quality is top-notch. Director Ruggero Deodato proves himself at the pinnacle of his career and directs the film he will be remembered for forever. The camera-work is authentic and the acting works, especially in the case of the student film-makers who fill out their roles very well indeed. Much-needed light relief comes from Robert Kerman (EATEN ALIVE) as the pipe-smoking Professor Monroe, who acts as the audience in viewing the discovered footage, and who gets to utter the immortal line ""I wonder who the REAL cannibals are?"" at the film's conclusion. The most effective aspect of the film is undoubtedly Riz Ortolani's emotive score, which really adds to the overall impact that the film has. It's frankly brilliant. Like it or hate it, CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST is a film with a lasting reputation and I personally think it's an original and deeply disturbing slice of (almost) real-life horror. It's a wonderful exploration of the media's obsession with violence and the lengths to which they'll go to exploit it and in this sense it's like the '80s version of the controversial thriller NATURAL BORN KILLERS.",Cannibal Holocaust
1,claudio_carvalho,"Extremely Realistic, Disturbing, Cruel and Sick",8,26 July 2009,"The director Alan Yates (Gabriel Yorke) and his crew, formed by Faye Daniels (Francesca Ciardi), Jack Anders (Perry Pirkanen) and Mark Tomaso (Luca Giorgio Barbareschi), head to a rain forest in Amazonas called Green Inferno to shoot a documentary about the primitive tribes of cannibals that live in the area. They vanish and the American anthropologist Professor Harold Monroe (Robert Kerman) travels to the area with the experienced guide Chaco Losojos (Salvatore Basile) and his assistant Miguel to seek the team out. The trio is received first by the Yacumo tribe of warriors and then they approach to the wild Yamamomo that is in a permanent war against the Shamatari. They find the remains of the documentary team and their reels, and they successfully negotiate with the savages. Back in New York, Professor Monroe watches the disturbing footage and discovers the fate of the team.I finally have had the chance to watch ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and I found it an extremely realistic, disturbing, cruel and sick. The movie is so realistic that gives the sensation of a documentary; disturbing because of the unpleasant and gruesome subject – cannibalism; cruel with the animals – the turtle, the pig, the monkey; and sick since the abnormal behavior of Alan Yates and his crew is mentally ill and nauseating. The bold director Ruggero Deodato depicts an explicit violence that Hollywood would never dare show. The make-up and choreography are impressive, but this movie is recommended only for specific audiences – sensitive people must not watch. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): Not Available",Cannibal Holocaust
2,kosmasp,Abuse - morals gone,6,10 September 2020,"Now if you are an animal lover - why are you here? Believe me you don't want to see this! You won't even mind for why animals were abused in this. Mostly the animals killed here (yes they actually did that!), were for food. So while especially the scene with the shelled ""friend"" seems like torture, it is not something that is not happening to other animals most of us eat daily.I'm just trying to give you a perspective so you won't feel like a hypocrite after you say certain things. Not to excuse what is being depicted in this. And while that may sound like a weird warning to a cannibal movie (and no human was harmed in the making of this - at least not in a deadly way), but it is important to note such things, so you are fully informed when it comes to deciding if you want to watch this or not.The other thing is the movie became infamous and Ruggero knew what he was doing. Nowadays this is almost unthinkable. Apart from Blair Witch Project, where the filmmaker apparently never had seen this, otherwise he wouldn't have made his movie which changed the landscape ... but this one changed a lot of things too. While the movie pretended that its actors were dead (told them not to involve themselves in other projects after this was finished), the filmmaker got into legal trouble, because people believed this was completely real. The real animal torture killing and the overall realistic looking effects did the rest ... especially one impaling scene! Ruggero has since explained how he did (quite ""easy"" faked), but still many are awed by how it looks.So to summarize, this is depraved, this is dirty, this is appaling and this will make many sick to their stomach ... mission accomplished",Cannibal Holocaust
3,gavin6942,There's a Reason This Film is Considered Notorious,8,29 March 2009,"A group of documentarians go into the Amazon to film warring cannibal tribes. Unfortunately for them, they don't make it back. An anthropologist is sent in to find them, and is horrified when he sees the grisly images they captured on film.Let me make a confession. Despite being a serious horror fan and having met Ruggero Deodato twice, engaging in some interesting conversation with him, I had never seen ""Cannibal Holocaust"" before. I had a fairly good idea of what to expect from it, as I was familiar with Umberto Lenzi's ""Cannibal Ferox"", which I suspected was quite similar (something I suspected correctly). But I think it's safe to say Deodato went further than Lenzi's imitation did.Starring Robert Kerman (perhaps better known for his many pornographic films), it's not surprising that this film pushes the boundaries on nudity and cruelty. Men and women naked, some of them sexually brutalized... animals killed, including a monkey who gets his face cut off and the infamous ""turtle scene"". I was actually somewhat disturbed by this film -- at the very least, rather uncomfortable. One scene where an adulteress is punished was particularly disturbing for me.I don't think those of you who are squeamish will want to see this one... or those who don't like seeing animals killed (yes, Virginia, the animals killed on screen)... but if you want to see a horror film with some sense of reality in it, this is it. There's also a strong social commentary in it about what makes man civilized or not, but I won't get into that... you'll see it.",Cannibal Holocaust
4,lee_eisenberg,Who defines civilization?,5,18 January 2014,"Ruggero Deodato's ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is one of those movies that is truly going to split people (oops, should I have said it like that?). People who like exploitation cinema are going to rank it alongside ""Citizen Kane"" and ""Dr. Strangelove"", while just about anyone else is going to want every copy of it incinerated. One of the original found footage movies, it contains every type of gory scene imaginable, along with graphic rapes. It could just be a typical excuse to assault people's senses (something that one of the characters notes that people want) although it comes across more as a look at the question of what constitutes civilization. The tribe's actions are no more brutal than what the journalists do to the animals. As Gandhi said when asked his opinion of western civilization: ""I think that it would be a good idea."" It should be noted that this is NOT a movie for the fainthearted. It contains some of the ugliest scenes ever put on the screen. I feel like I have to appreciate the fact that someone was willing to put this on the screen. It's the perfect example of exploitation cinema. Just make sure that you understand what kind of a movie it is before watching it.",Cannibal Holocaust
5,jboothmillard,Cannibal Holocaust,5,5 November 2010,"I heard about this film because of the programme The Perfect Scary Movie, when it was discussing ""found footage"" films, like The Blair Witch Project. Also many have heard about this for being apparently the most controversial film ever made, especially in the ""video nasty"" market, so I had to see what all the fuss was about. Basically New York anthropologist Professor Harold Monroe (Robert Kerman) with experienced guide Chaco Losojos (Salvatore Basile) and his assistant are heading for the jungles of South America to find a missing film crew. Director Alan Yates (Carl Gabriel Yorke), his girlfriend and script girl Faye Daniels (Francesca Ciardi), and cameramen Jack Anders (Perry Pirkanen) and Mark Tomaso (Luca Giorgio Barbareschi) were there filming a documentary, and have been missing for two months. They arrive, and during their time they meet both tribes living in this environment, the Yanomamo (living by the riverside) and the the Shamatari/Yacumo (or tree people), both at war with each other. After spending some time with the seemingly friendly but torturous (to their enemies) tribes people, the team do eventually find the remains of the documentary crew, and the undeveloped film cannister. After returning to New York, Professor Monroe plans to show the film to the public on a TV station, but not before fully reviewing the whole reel, and what he discovers is much more sinister than he thought. The film reveals that the tribes didn't just torture and kill each other, but the film crew were killed by the people and their flesh was eaten in hideous cannibalistic fashion. All the action of flesh eating, pulling a pregnant woman's foetus out of her body, a woman with a pole going through her bottom and coming out her mouth, animal cruelty and much more besides has all been caught on film, and the TV people agree in the end it should be destroyed. I was certainly shocked by the foetus moment, and the flesh eating scenes are nasty enough, but all the stuff in between was a little annoying. It is a little laughable now that this film was taken to court to determine that it was all fake, but certainly the animal cruelty is realistic, but as a film, just like The Human Centipede I've seen stuff I consider worse, but not a bad horror. Worth watching!",Cannibal Holocaust
6,BA_Harrison,Scores maximum points for its ability to shock!,10,22 June 2006,"Opening with a spectacular aerial view of the Amazon accompanied by a score as lush as the tropical foliage depicted, Ruggero Deodato's infamous cannibal shocker begins innocuously enough. However, by the time the end credits roll, the viewer will have experienced one of the most gruelling cinematic experiences ever to have been filmed.When a team of documentary makers go missing whilst filming in the Amazon, a professor, his guide and an assistant attempt an expedition in order to discover what happened to them. They discover that the jungle where the film-makers disappeared is ruled by two rival tribes of cannibals. They make contact with one tribe and after gaining their trust, they stay a while to experience life in a stone-age society at first hand; they even witness savage rituals and are invited to stay for a spot of lunch (bloody entrails, anyone?). After discovering the remains of the missing documentary makers (fashioned into a strange monument), the professor manages to retrieve cannisters of undeveloped film and returns to New York.Upon viewing the film, he discovers the shocking truth about the film-makers; they were vicious sadists who deliberately engineered violent events in order to spice up their footage. After killing and raping some of the tribe members, they are eventually set upon, and end up being mutilated in front of their own camera.Deodato's movie is an expertly crafted film and is undeniably powerful and unforgettable stuff. The last forty-five minutes or so, which comprises mainly of the recovered documentary footage, is extremely disturbing, featuring graphic and realistic gore FX, animal mutilation and violent sexual abuse, perpetrated by both the natives and the film-makers. Deodato forces the viewer to re-evaluate how they feel about their own society and asks the question 'Are we really any more civilised than those we call savages?' Whilst hard to describe as 'entertaining' (the revolting animal scenes are particularly hard to stomach), Cannibal Holocaust is a cut above most cannibal films. It is a relentless attack on the senses that should be seen not just by fans of extreme horror, but by all serious movie fans who appreciate innovative, groundbreaking cinema.",Cannibal Holocaust
7,Quinoa1984,"Good times, Cannibal Salad",9,16 August 2008,"Cannibal Holocaust was not something I exactly wanted to see, and I didn't rush out out to buy it the day Grindhouse releasing put out the uncut version on DVD. But I kept hearing that it was a movie that, if someone very interested in films- or just in the most shocking in the realm of cult and exploitation- this was something to see at least once. It's called the most notorious of its kind, and after watching it tonight I can report that it's not far from the truth. It is shocking, and horrifying, and makes you feel about the human race that everything at base level is so barbaric that it might not be worth a damn. But what could be just another schlock-fest from a director who just wants to chuck crap up on the screen in the form of bad acting and blood and poor craftsmanship actually isn't what's served up. On this level, it way exceeded any expectations I had, and is in fact one of the more satisfying exploitation pictures of the period.This is mostly due in part to the dedication on part of Ruggero Deodato to actually tell a story reasonably well, and to even throw in some biting (however shallow) commentary on the state of sensationalism on the news and how colonialism seems to repeat itself when the opportunity knocks with the wrong bunch of Westerners. The first half of the movie is told in a straightforward style, shot without any amateurish meddling however in low-budget form, as a professor at NYU goes on a search with a couple of guides to locate a documentary film crew that went missing in the South American jungles. From the outset, we're led to believe the worst has occurred, that the film crew got slaughtered and eaten by a tribe of cannibal natives. Some pieces end up standing out as shocking already, like a moment where we see how a man ""deals"" with an unfaithful woman, but for the most part it's relatively with only bits of action and terror.The second half, however, is when things get ugly as the professor, back in New York, looks over the footage shot on 16mm by the crew and sees how things really went down. Is it perhaps a little much on the part of Deodato to show how cruel and vicious and to a point fake the documentary filmmakers are in treating their subjects? Yes and no; yes because of course it is exploiting the expectations of the audience, and making it easy for us to not feel any sympathy for when the bloody, ""realistic"" climax rolls around, but not so much because he and his cast do it so convincingly. This is unlike the more recent Cloverfield where we're made to feel sympathy for the characters but are not given much of a reason to do so on the outset of this 'docu-real' scenario. And there's also a stark message underlying this which is cyclical in nature, and without stating the very obvious last line that the professor makes at the end of the picture it is, in fact, a question of barbarism.I should point out that even when Cannibal Holocaust is at its most effective it's not any kind of 'great' movie. It left me shaken and stirred and a little repulsed, sometimes a lot (the turtle scene somehow really got to me more than anything, if only for the time and detail spent in wallowing in it, which was the correct decision based on the atmosphere), but it is only as good (or bad depending on view) as it can be based on the action and low-budget direction and make-up effects. Sometimes it is somewhat shoddy in production value, or in talent. But most of its flaws are supplemented by Deodatto's rigorous attempt at for one never making it boring, which is crucial for an exploitation picture in retrospect, and for also keeping the story focused and the continuing situation tense and bleak amid the shock value. There's some things committed here that I dare not reveal, but only so you can experience them yourself in all their faux-realism that, at the end of it all, has a slight, nasty satirical kick. There's guts here, no pun intended, and it's everything you've heard and then some - oddly enough, also a well-directed picture, despite the director's own ashamed (though understandable) feelings about the making of it today. Don't watch this alone!",Cannibal Holocaust
8,BandSAboutMovies,This one really goes all the way then comes back and goes twice as far,8,19 February 2018,"Cannibal Holocaust has always been a movie that by reputation that I've avoided. It's been tagged as ""the one that goes all the way"" and has been banned in over fifty countries. And it isn't every movie that gets confiscated ten days after its premiere with the director arrested and charged with obscenity.How much of this film was inspired by Gualtiero Jacopetti and his cycle of mondo films, like Mondo Cane, Africa Addio and Goodbye Uncle Tom. I think Deodato tips his hand toward this influence by using the music of Italian composer Riz Ortolani, whose song ""More"" was featured in Mondo Cane (it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 1963). Ortolani's soundtrack is, well, the best part of the film. The opening song is gorgeous and lush, with only a subtle hint that all will not be well.It's hard to truly believe in the ""who are the real animals"" narrative when it seems like Deodato learned none of those lessons for himself. Still, I feel that films should challenge you and push you and make you think. I wouldn't recommend this film. I'm not upset that I watched it. But I know how people are about having their sensibilities threatened and this is a film that will bleed, puke and piss all over them before eating the remains.",Cannibal Holocaust
9,Coventry,Shock horror and inhuman thrills...'The Green Inferno' is the place to be!,10,21 February 2004,"You've got horror...and then you've HORROR with a capital H! And cannibal holocaust surely belongs in this last category. It's a misunderstood masterpiece that yet has to find an equal. Unlike the savage and schlock title leads you to believe, there's much more to discover in this film than just gore, bad dubbing and shocking rites. In the very first place, it's a portrait of extremes. The so-called 'civilized' world versus the savage tribes in the Columbian Rainforest. In a subtle way, Ruggero Deodato asks the question who the real cannibals are in this film...those who're just following their traditional and ancients life-styles or those who're full of disrespect and willing to sacrifice everything in order to shoot a controversial story. The basic plot handles about a young film-crew who mysteriously vanished while shooting an anthropology documentary. Their footage is retrieved by a university professor (Robert Kerman) and he's given the chance to broadcast the documentary after all. But...the horrible and inhuman truth as shown by the recovered footage explains the crew's disappearance more clearly and it questions severely whether they deserve a tribute or not. A funny detail to this movie is that it more or less spoofs exploitative film-making, while it's practically an exploitation film itself! Nonetheless, the film is surprisingly professionally made with a terrific cinematoghrapy and good editing. The most barbaric sequences become unforgettable thanks to the magnificent and intense musical score by Riz Ortolani. Cannibal Holocaust enjoys an immense cult-status in cinema and it's one of the ONLY films who deserves this for a 100%! I'm not going to debate whether the vicious animal-killing scenes are real or not because, frankly, I don't care and they contribute a lot in the breath-taking realism and effectiveness of this film. Cannibal Holocaust should be avoided by the faint-hearted, whining moralists and easily offended pansies...All the rest of you: Watch Deodato's greatest achievement and acknowledge its power!!!",Cannibal Holocaust
10,Theo Robertson,Legendary Nasty Horror Movie,6,5 May 2015,"Recently seeing a documentary about the moral outrage about the infamous video nasties that were on the market I thought I'd try and track one of the nastier nasties and with a title like CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST it doesn't sound much nastier than that . Let's not forget this is Italian exploitation horror cinema and these Italians really know how to push the boat out when it comes to this gore laden genre . Add to this an infamous marketing image on the original video cover and an even more infamous reputation since the film really does feature real life animals being killed and you've got a film that someone who has even the most vague interest in horror films wouldn't want to missThe film starts in a rather pretentious self important manner with quotes from Thomas Jefferson and others pointing out the importance of liberty and never forgetting the past . The first filmed sequence takes place via a television broadcast that while we now live in the space age we know very little about what's going on in the more remote parts of the world . As I said there's a pretentious and self important element to all this especially when the TV reporter comes out with hyperbole that the human race are ""About to conquer the universe"" which would be difficult enough achievement for a highly developed race like the Daleks , never mind humanity in the late 20th Century but despite all this it doesn't really seem to harm a film that is merely exploitation cinema And exploitation cinema it is and it's not long before the film starts nailing its colours to the mast by having an intrepid TV journalist leading an expedition to darkest South America to find out what happened to a previous news crew . Now it's at this point you realise how easy it would have been to have the story to continue with intrepid TV journalist suffering the same ordeal as his prior peers but doesn't happen . He finds the film cans of the previous journalists and takes them back to NYC to find out their fate and how it happened Of course the film's marketing took over on its initial release and the film was being touted as ""real life footage"" and if you read the trivia section on this page you'll find that director Ruggero Deadato was arrested by Italian police and accused of murdering the actors in the film . I'm sorry but I'm calling BS on that one . As unpleasant as some of the scenes might be it would have been fairly obvious back then as it is now that only thing going on was acting . Okay it's not great acting and it's filmed in a grungy manner but it's impossible to believe anyone would be taken in by this . As one character spouts ""As a man on the street I find this documentary footage dishonest"" This is all a pity of sorts because despite its infamy which is earned where the real slaughter of animals is concerned and the infamy that is unearned - cast members being murdered for real indeed - there is a very serious subtext in the heart of the film and white people venturing in to a remote jungle , upsetting the natives and coming off second best reminded of ill fated colonial campaigns in general and Vietnam in particular . As someone says ""Makes me wonder who the real cannibals are ?""",Cannibal Holocaust
11,Hey_Sweden,I wonder who the real cannibals are.,8,4 August 2012,"Notorious hardcore horror film hits you right in the gut for over an hour and a half. To say that it's not for everybody is an understatement; it's impossible to walk away from it and not be affected. In fact, to say that this viewer ""enjoyed"" it may not be entirely accurate, but everything that it does, it does extremely well. It's that kind of a movie. Ultimately, it's not exactly subtle about the messages it espouses, and it's exceedingly grim for much of its running time. It works as a prototype for the modern, popular ""found footage"" genre, almost two decades before ""The Blair Witch Project"" had its great success.The story chronicles the journey of an NYC university professor, Harold Monroe (Robert Kerman), to discover the fate of a documentary film crew who had disappeared after venturing into the Amazon. At first, when we find out that they indeed met a horrible fate, that's not the real twist. The real twist is what motivated the local tribe to treat them this way. These filmmakers were no saints - in fact, they were just the opposite.Director Ruggero Deodato here creates a movie that you don't just watch but experience. It's all too believable throughout, with its many scenes of violence against animals understandably too much for some viewers to take. Gorgeous cinematography and convincing performances are heavy assets; when one sees just how depraved the supposed ""civilized"" individuals were, they may feel sick to their stomachs. Contrasting all of this is a main musical theme by Riz Ortolani so utterly lovely it doesn't seem to belong in a horror film at all, but that's why it works as well as it does.The film spends a fair amount of time in the jungle until at a climactic point back in NYC Monroe and dubious TV executives view the footage that the documentarians shot. For a while these executives are eager to exploit the sensational content until they realize just how ugly things got.The overall effect of ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is very sobering, but unless some of the elements of its presentation are a turn off for the individual viewer, it does rank as something well worth a look. As was already said, it's nothing if not memorable.Eight out of 10.",Cannibal Holocaust
12,poolandrews,The English censor's favourite film... not. Classic Italian cannibal flick with a message!,8,20 February 2008,"Cannibal Holocaust starts in New York City where anthropologist Professor Harold Monroe (Robert Kerman) works, together with New York University & a TV station Monroe sets up an expedition to the Amazon jungle in Colombia where four documentary filmmakers vanished without trace in an attempt to find out what happened to them. Director Alan Yates (Carl Gabriel York) his girlfriend & writer Faye Daniels (Francesca Ciardi) along with two cameramen Jack Anders (Perry Pirkanen) & Mark Tomaso (Luca Barbareschi) plus their guide Felipe (Ricardo Fuentes) were last seen heading into the jungle in search of cannibalistic tribes, together with his guide Monroe retraces the four filmmakers steps & discovers the cans of film that they shot. Back in New York Monroe develops the film which show's shocking footage of all sorts of atrocities & reveals what happened to the filmmakers...This Italian production directed by Ruggero Deodato & one could make the argument that Cannibal Holocaust is thematically the most interesting & thought provoking of all the Italian cannibal flicks although I also could see why someone might label it as cheap gross exploitation just like any other Italian cannibal flick. Personally I think it's a really great film, it's certainly more intelligent & challenging than just about any other Italian cannibal flick but that on it's own may not be enough for most people to enjoy it. The mainstream film that Cannibal Holocaust most resembles is The Blair Witch Project (1999) which have very similar story lines. The script by Gianfranco Clerici ask's questions & uses it's premise & gut munching gore & exploitation to try & get it's point across. The basic aim of Cannibal Holocaust is to make us, the audience, question who the real savages, primitives & cannibals are since the four documentary filmmakers are portrayed as the villains rather than the cannibals. This is fine but one has to say that in that case Cannibal Holocaust comes across as rather hypocritical, the film seemingly condemns the documentary makers for killing animals & exploiting the natives for their own ends but in reality that is exactly what Cannibal Holocaust as a film & it's makers do. There are scenes of various animals being graphically mutilated & killed, there are voyeuristic scenes showing cannibals at work eating flesh & sequences showing inhuman & ancient tribal rites just to add to the violence & gore levels. It's just odd that as a film Cannibal Holocaust & it's makers condemn the very acts that make the film what it is & seem to take great pleasure in showing the audience. Having said that it does have a very strong well thought out story, it's very watchable & it one of those films which you can't help but look at whether your enjoying it or not, the character's are good & the dialogue is surprisingly good for a dubbed Italian cannibal flick as well. Not for everyone but for those with the stomach then Cannibal Holocaust is a must.Director Deodato does a nice job, shot on location in New York & the Amazon this looks authentic although once you see one bit of Amazonian jungle you've seen them all! At the time of Cannibal Holocaust's release in Italy the film was banned & director Deodato was charged with obscenity & unbelievably murder! Facing life in prison Deodato simply contacted the actor's involved & presented them in court, case dismissed & I bet the police felt like idiots! Apparently at the time Cannibal Holocaust was made director Deodato didn't care about the animal killings or cannibal scenes but has since gone on record as saying he now wishes he never made the film. There are real animal killings in Cannibal Holocaust, they are explicit & I would expect many to find them upsetting. On a personal level I couldn't give a toss that real animals were killed in Cannibal Holocaust, that will probably outrage some but that's the way I feel. Millions of animals are killed in slaughter houses everyday, what's the different? Ironically the killings & executions seen in the The Last Road to Hell segment are supposed to be fake but are real while the killings in the film proper which are meant to be real are fake! The gore levels are high but fairly well spread out, there's cannibal intestine eating scenes, decapitated heads, people impaled on sticks, a leg is chopped off with a machete & character's are sliced up.With a supposed budget of about $100,000 Cannibal Holocaust is very well made with an often gritty documentary film look about it which suits the film perfectly. The acting is strong from most of the cast although dubbed it's better dubbed than most Italian exploitation flicks.Cannibal Holocaust is a notorious film, it's an acquired taste for sure but for those who crave extreme cinema, exploitation & gore then you are almost certain to enjoy it. If not then your not. Like many classic horror films Hollywood has decided to remake it as Cannibal Holocaust (2009) but I can't see it being anywhere near as effective as this.",Cannibal Holocaust
13,lastliberal,Today people want sensationalism; the more you rape their senses the happier they are.,8,26 September 2008,"This film was disturbing on so many levels. In fact, I could not even sit through it all at once. I had to take a break and come back and finish it the next day. I have not seen a film as disturbing as this since ""I Spit on Your Grave."" One shouldn't be disturbed at seeing animals slaughtered if you eat meat. After all, you have to kill it to cook it. But, the animals slaughtered in this film seemed still alive when they were being cut up. The chopping of the monkey head to get at the brains was especially harsh. It made me want to join Peta and become a vegetarian.The punishing of a native woman for adultery was hard to watch. It would have been easier to just stone her and not have to go through this ritual.I felt sorry for the four adventurers when I saw what happened to them, but I changed my mind when I saw what they did in the village just before they met their fate. Good riddance to such trash! Watching the last few chapters today was even more difficult with gang rapes, disembowelment and decapitations. This is the ultimate cannibal movie and the only one that anyone needs to see to experience this type of film making.",Cannibal Holocaust
14,Boba_Fett1138,Now that's more like it!,10,20 September 2007,"There are lots of cannibal movies over the years and they are all equally gory and provocative but yet also ridicules because of their overwritten silly stories with silly plot-lines and characters. This really is not the case ""Cannibal Holocaust"", since it chooses an effective and realistic approach by partly telling the entire movie in documentary style. It was also one of the reasons why many people at the time and still believe that this is a snuff movie, with real people getting killed in it. It still makes this one of the most controversial films ever made, even to this date. In its genre, this was a quite modern movie at its time. The approach was new to people and it surprised them. Director Ruggero Deodato got almost prosecuted in Italy for slaying real people in front of the camera and the movie was also banned in several countries for graphic gore, sexual violence, and for the genuine slaying of six animals featured in the film. I believe it's even banned in some countries till this date. At least I really wouldn't be surprised if it was.It's quite hard now to believe that people at time thought that the events in this movie were all real. I mean, the acting is so bad and the blood is typically early '80's fake reddish looking and all sequences are all too obviously staged, filmed and cut. But then again there will be always people who keep believing these sort of things. Remember at the time of ""The Blair Witch Project"", in 1999, many people thought that one was real as well. The whole controversy, that is even now still surrounding this movie, makes it part of its charisma and cult status. This alone is for many people reason to watch it.But really this movie is so much more than. Intentionally or not (opinios differ on it) the movie also works great as a social commentary on various aspects of modern civilization and sensationalism. Themes in this movie still apply today, which makes this movie just as powerful effective and relevant as almost 30 years ago. Especially the plot line with the producers wanting to release the shot documentary, to meet the public's demands and needs still applies and would be relevant today. People always have had an hunger for real violence, war and other things like that on TV. TV stations try to exploit this as best as possible, with shows such as ""Cops"" and ""The Jerry Springer Show"". But also on the regular every day news, with more images of war areas and natural disasters and such coming on, day in, day out. even though you really don't want to see these things, you subconsciously still think and say; why doesn't the camera move in any closer? Why don't they show more of what happened? Etcetera. The human curiosity and fascination for the unknown is simply too big to feed. For instance nobody wanted to see Nick Berg being decapitated an Islamic terror group in Iraq but still thousands, if not millions of people watched the video online, which proofs my point.Yes, this movie is an extremely graphic and gory one. Not only because of the human slaying and cannibalism in the movie but also, if not more, because of the REAL animal killings in it. The turtle sequences is already legendary. For those who've always been interested in how the insides of an turtle look like; watch this movie! Also shocking are the many sexual abuse- and killing rituals in this movie. Even though I'm no woman, I can still imaging the pain. But also the male crowed will have something shocking thrown at them, involving the one-eyed trouser snake.The movie looks mostly realistic due to its limited resources and restrained budget. Basically halve of the movie is done in documentary style which only adds to this. The camera-work is extremely effective. Suggestive camera-work often works more effective than cutting back and forth between different camera-angles. Also of course the jungle and natives portrayed in this movie adds to the claustrophobic and more horror kind of atmosphere.The movie has such a great symphonic theme! Something you really wouldn't expect from a movie like this and it seems out of place but yet perfectly suits the images on screen. Italian horror scores and scores in general are often under-appreciated, simply because of the fact that they aren't really widely known and released.Works great as a fascinating and extremely gory cannibalism movie but perhaps works ever more striking as a social commentary, which still applies today.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Cannibal Holocaust
15,morrison-dylan-fan,Ruggero Deodato's Jungle Trilogy:Part 2.,10,7 February 2021,"After the double eyeful from the Golden Age of Adult Cinema with Afternoon Delights and Ladies Night (both 1980-both also reviewed) I looked for a final title to end my viewings for a best films of 1980 poll. Getting the uncut DVD of the movie after becoming aware of it, but never finding the right moment to confront it,I decided it was finally time to unearth this infamous found footage.View on the film:Returning to the jungle originally planning to make a Mondo film, directing auteur Ruggero Deodato works for the first of two times with Don't Torture a Duckling (1972-also reviewed) cinematographer Sergio D'Offizi, and takes the rawness he had been grinding in Jungle Holocaust (1977-also reviewed) to a abrasive progression.Separating the reels of the film in two, Deodato continues to display his unflinching eye for violence, with sickening animal killing footage, placing the viewer up-close to the brutality inflicted by ""civilised"" Westerners such as Alan Yates and the rest of his film crew, whose occupation allows Deodato to end their jungle escapade with a direct comment on how the camera/screen detaches the viewer from violence taking place right in front of them.Wisely going up the river with Riz Ortolani's shimmering score marking the first of two times they would work together, Deodato and D'Offizi record Found Footage over a decade before the genre would fully appear,with brittle,hand-held camera moves stylishly immersing the viewer into the cannibal genre,which Deodato threads to the real life horrifying sight of execution footage from Nigeria and South East Asia,reeled in the ""documentary"" The Last Road To Hell the crew had made before entering the jungle.Although the last line is very on the nose, the screenplay by Deodato's regular writer Gianfranco Clerici (here joined with Giorgio Stegani ) records the bleak atmosphere Deodato is recording with a unrelenting nihilistic horror where the lives of the cannibal tribe are burnt down by the increasingly brutal violence unleashed by the documentary film makers.",Cannibal Holocaust
16,The_Void,These savages ain't no vegetarians...,10,15 June 2005,"Cannibal Holocaust follows a film crew as they delve into the Amazonian jungle and end up discovering the true meaning of horror. This plot line sounds remarkably similar to the 1999 travesty 'The Blair Witch Project', but I'm pleased to say that's where the similarities end; as the crew in The Worst Film Ever Made may well have found a true horror if that's what you consider a few sticks and stones to be; but even so, it doesn't even nearly compare to actual horror, which is what the film crew in this film found. Cannibal Holocaust is a remarkable horror film because, unlike the majority of the rest of the genre, this film depicts events that actually do take place in the world. As the film claims towards the beginning, there's so much we don't know about our own planet, and the dense jungles of South America represent one of the greatest unknowns, and therefore makes for a great setting for a movie. It has to be said also that Ruggero Deodato makes best use of his location, and as the actors venture into the jungle, a constant foreboding atmosphere hangs over them, which does the film no end of favours in the tension department.One of the many things that this film is notorious for is the fact that the animal killings in the film are real. This is something that I definitely don't like, as I can honestly see no reason why animals should die just because Ruggero Deodato decided to make a movie. It's also shocking that the perpetrators of this animal cruelty weren't sent down. Of course, the animal deaths help the film because it adds to the atmosphere; but really, special effects would have sufficed. The violence in the movie isn't all senseless, however, as the director does have a point to make. At several points during the film, comparisons are made with the cannibals and our society; and the question that surfaces most often is; ""who are the real cannibals?"". This is where this movie comes into it's own, as one the surface it's just a violent exploitation flick, but beneath that it's a rather potent comment on society. The gore in the film is brutal and very realistic, which is always nice for a horror fan such as myself to see. If you're not a horror fan, however, Cannibal Holocaust is a film that you should stay away from. But if you don't mind gore, you're in for a rare treat with this movie. It's controversial for a reason, and it really needs to be experienced.",Cannibal Holocaust
17,HumanoidOfFlesh,Possibly one of the most brutal and disturbing horror movies ever made. **Spoilers**,10,7 March 2001,"""Cannibal Holocaust"" is a very shocking and powerful movie.A documentary film crew goes into the jungle of South America and is never seen of again.A search and rescue team is sent,but find only their remains and their stock of film they had shot about the last remaining cannibal tribes.The video footage is later screened in America.As shown in the footage,the film-makers found horrible death by the cannibal tribes after messing with them and committing crimes such as raping their women and killing their animals.Brilliant photography by Sergio d'Offizzi,great musical score by Riz Ortolani and some of the most horrifying scenes of cruelty ever captured to the film.Truly the violence is graphic as hell-lots of brutal animal butchery,rape,dismemberment,castration etc.One scene that I shall always remember is a part when the film-makers drag a giant turtle ashore and proceed to hack off it's legs,one by one,with a large machete,finishing up with beheading the beast.I like the other cannibal films I've seen,but they don't come close to ""Cannibal Holocaust"".Recommended only for Deodato fans and those who want something much more disturbing than any mainstream slasher picture-all others stay away.A masterpiece.",Cannibal Holocaust
18,Smells_Like_Cheese,Haunts you forever,8,27 May 2011,"What haven't I heard about Cannibal Holocaust? Only that it's one of the most disturbing movies of all time and still to this day manages to shock it's audience. Honestly I'm surprised that it took me this long to watch it, but I found the film on Google because I was cautious on paying 20 dollars for a film I never saw. Cannibal Holocaust thankfully is much more than just shocking but actually has a great message to it. The film isn't as shocking as I'm sure it was when it was released but it is a jaw dropper. Mainly due though to the real killings of the animals which is a bit too much to handle. At the time the director was also accused of murdering the three lead actors, talk about motivation, however he made the actors break the contract of silence, since he wanted the audience to think that this was a real film, in order to prove his innocence. Before the Blair Witch Project, there was no film like Cannibal Holocaust, I don't think a film has even touched it's ground since then.There is a television documentary about a missing United States film crew, who disappeared on an expedition to the Amazon to make a documentary about indigenous cannibal tribes. The team was Alan, the director; Faye, script girl; and two cameramen, Jack and Mark. Harold Monroe, an anthropologist, has agreed to lead a rescue team and flies to the Amazon to meet his guides. There the team meets hostility and learn that the film group had caused great unrest among the people. The Ya̧nomamö invite Monroe and his team to their village, where they are treated with suspicion. A group of Ya̧nomamö women take him to a shrine, which he learns holds the bones of the missing American filmmakers. Monroe confronts the Ya̧nomamö about this. After playing a tape recorder for them, he trades it for the first team's surviving reels of film. Back in New York, executives invite Monroe to host a broadcast of a documentary to be made from the recovered film. Monroe wants to see the raw footage first, finding out who might be the real savages after all.Did the animal killings bother me? The turtle scene definitely did, I understand that the meat was used for meals, but it was a bit too much for me to handle the brutality of the killing. I won't go into details, just if you're an animal lover like I am then fast forward through that part too. However, what I did appreciate about the film was how realistic it did look, the director did a great job of finding locations, actors and the over all feel of the film as you feel dirty and embarrassed watching such horror on the screen. While I may not agree with the animal killings, this message of who are the real savages really got to me. I loved that this wasn't about just grossing people out but showing how crazy people can get over money and power. It's really sad and it's weird to think that the documentary crew that went into the project that you thought were originally the victims of such violent tribes were actually the one's who are wild animals and in some sick way deserved the justice that was served to them. While it's a hard movie to watch, I would say that it was worth it, again not for the faint of heart, but a true classic and I'm sure will still shock for many generations to come.8/10",Cannibal Holocaust
19,Red-Barracuda,Genuinely offensive,6,13 June 2013,"Well I finally got around to watching Cannibal Holocaust. I had been aware of this film for the past thirty years but had never made any attempt to actually watch it. It just sounded too repulsive. Well, as I say, that is until now. The reputation of this movie goes before it and its plot line is so well known that I just don't feel the need to go over it again. What I will do is simply give my emotional reaction to it. I think this is justifiable simply because this is a movie that assaults you. I can't honestly say I enjoyed it, I would say more accurately I endured it. As many probably know, many of the films from the video nasty list are amazingly light-weight and inoffensive. Well this one isn't in that category. This is a very nasty and mean-spirited affair indeed. Interestingly, its director Ruggero Deodato was responsible for the other film on the video nasty list that is closest to Cannibal Holocaust's level of repulsiveness and that was The House on the Edge of the Park. That one has a draw-droppingly excessive amount of sexual violence and it's overall extremely disturbing. Both films make you feel somewhat dirty for having watched them. I suppose you have to say that Deodato is a very uncompromising director indeed. These are films not for the not-so-easily offended. Many horror fans will find them too exploitatively nasty.Cannibal Holocaust shares the very repulsive sexual violence of Park but it brings in two other key ingredients, namely an underlying social commentary and the infamous animal slaughter. The latter is a feature of the Italian Cannibal films in general and it really makes for diabolically horrible viewing. It's a pretty low way to shock audiences by shooting a pig – okay you've got our attention but where is the skill in that. In fairness, even worse things happen in slaughterhouses every day but there is just something particularly nauseating about the gloating nature of the turtle scene, with the characters goofing around with the poor beast's severed head for the camera. All of the excesses of the movie mean that the social commentary is somewhat lost in the mix. The idea that the media exploit events for their own gain is most certainly one that carries some weight, particularly in the case of the Italian 60's Mondo movies of which I am sure were a big influence on this film. But it's so very, very hard to get past the extreme violence.How to rate Cannibal Holocaust? It's one of the most difficult films for me to score because this is a well-made film and it has definitely sickened me and that was the intention. But much of the experience for me was a negative one where I felt somewhat debased actually watching it. So I have settled for a middling score that reflects the skill and originality of this genuinely troubling movie but which also acknowledges that in many other ways I was appalled.",Cannibal Holocaust
20,bensonmum2,"""Today people want sensationalism; the more you rape their senses the happier they are.""",9,12 February 2006,"Going into a film like Cannibal Holocaust, it's difficult to know what to expect. Anyone who has any interest has read all the hype - the most disturbing movie ever made, banned in 60 countries, real animal killings, director Ruggero Deodato had to go to court to prove the human killings weren't real, etc. What I didn't expect to discover was such a well-made film. Parts of the film are indeed very brutal and, at times, difficult to watch. There are images in the film that I won't soon forget. The story is incredibly compelling because it is so real. Tribes of Indians similar to the ones presented in this film did (and in some cases do) exist in the South American rain forests. I suppose that if someone were looking for a ""deep"" meaning to Deodato's film, they might point to the man vs. nature aspects of the film where nature is represented not just by the animals, but by the natives as well. I suppose one could find something in the notion of who the real savages are - the natives or the filmmakers who exploit them. But the most amazing thing about Cannibal Holocaust is that somehow Deodato has made it very beautiful.",Cannibal Holocaust
21,bowmanblue,The Blair Witch's grandfather,7,21 May 2014,"It's impossible to talk about Cannibal Holocaust without mentioning The Blair Witch Project. Blair Witch is (wrongly) labelled as 'inventing' the 'found footage' genre, when, in fact it simply 'rebooted' it. Cannibal Holocaust did it almost twenty years previous.We hear at the beginning how four young film-makers travelled deep into the jungle, only to never be heard from again. A professor, curious as to their fate, retraces their path and finds their footage. What you have here is two stories in one. You have the more 'traditional' Hollywood story-telling of the professor talking to TV executives about showing the found footage on network television and the footage which was retrieved from the jungles (first person, ala Blair Witch).I only got to see the edited UK version of this film, but the footage, both from the professor who follows them and the film-makers themselves remains as shocking today as it was at the time. Cannibal Holocaust was banned at the time of release and even had claims of being a 'stuff' film (i.e. one where real people are killed on camera). This maybe untrue, but viewers should be warned that, although the people who die are all just covered in fake blood and prosthetics, REAL animals were killed for the making of the film. Those with strong views on this may wish to steer clear.However, the animal cruelty is only fleeting. What you have are pretty strong scenes of torture which make the Hostel franchise seem tame in comparison. The footage, being shot in the eighties and on 'non professional' cameras, gives the film a deliberately 'raw' feel about it which even the Blair Witch Project can't even match. Plus you have the music which is both creepy and tranquil at the same time.As you have probably guessed, the film-makers (on film) meet a grisly end at the hands (and teeth, obviously) of the cannibals in the jungle. Although, where we probably felt sorry for those behind the camera in Blair Witch and other such films, here the film-makers were pretty horrible. Some may see that they got what they deserved.It's hard to 'enjoy' this film in a traditional viewing sense. Yet it remains a deserved lynchpin in the horror genre's history.Bottom line: for those with strong stomachs ONLY.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Cannibal Holocaust
22,ericstevenson,"Yeah, it probably deserves to be banned",5,15 August 2016,"Well, here it is everybody. The movie that was banned in the most countries. Is it really one of the most notorious films of all time? Yeah, pretty much. Having recently seen ""Caligula"", I will at least give this movie credit for not being as bad as that movie. The violence and nudity here does seem to serve more of a purpose. It is more interesting and seems to send more of a message. Of course, it's still just nothing but destruction over and over. Little in the movie makes sense at all. It's weird as how you appreciate how good the effects are, as people who saw the movie sincerely thought it was a snuff film.Well, it wasn't, but they really did kill animals in this. Okay, they did eat them, so I guess that means it's fine? The part where the turtle is killed is one of the most disturbing things I have ever seen in a film, probably because, well it's real. This was one of the first found footage movies ever made and while I do enjoy certain ones like ""Cloverfield"", this obviously didn't do much for me. I had no clue I could even find this movie at all because you'd think it would be rare! The characters in this film truly are evil and might deserve their deaths. They're still pretty stupid with their actions. Look, I could never recommend a movie that literally killed animals. Whatever your argument might be, if you're really morbid then you should see this. I guess this could qualify as a porn movie, so I was tricked into seeing another one after ""Caligula"". Dang it! **",Cannibal Holocaust

Deodato lost the original trial, and all prints were to be destroyed, but he managed to have the ruling overturned in the early '80s when the actors finally appeared on TV to prove otherwise.Some five years passed before the film saw release in Deodato's home country.

I think it's hard to chew.",5,4 August 2013,"Like Hannibal Lector in 1991's Silent of the Lambs, there is a thin line that between genius and insanity. I think Cannibal Holocaust cross that line to insanity. This movie could had been really smart, but end ups being unpleasant to watch. Directed by Ruggero Deodato known for a lot of cannibals film, and written by Gianfranco Clerici, Cannibal Holocaust is the first film to use 'the found' footage structure that works similar to a flashback. The film's notion of ""recovered footage"" has influenced the now-popular genre of found footage horror films, such as 1999's The Blair Witch Project, 2008's Cloverfield, and other works. The film tells the stories of two parties of explorers and how they dealt with an Amazon Rainforest indigenous tribes. One of the parties, treat the tribe to the best of their ability with respect; while the other party end up being chow down because they were being jerks to the tribe. The party that treat the tribe with respect, leaded by New York University anthropologist Harold Monroe (ex-porn star Robert Kerman) end up with the rescue mission of looking for missing documentary film crew and to learn what really happen to them. Cannibal Holocaust is notorious for its graphic violence that aroused a great deal of controversy to the point that some people thought it was real and the director was charge for a crime. People really thought it was a snuff film due to rumors that claimed some actors were killed on camera. In my opinion, it is. There is old footage filmed during the crisis in Uganda in the 1970's where real life people were executed by a firing squad in The Last Road to Hell. That scenes alone is disrespected for the family of those people that die in that crisis. To see that footage be used for entertaining purposes for another fake horror movie is horrible. Although Deodato was later cleared from the crime when he show that his actor didn't die, the film was still banned in several countries due to its disturbing portrayal of graphic brutality, sexual assault such as rape, and animal violence. Critics have suggested that the film is a commentary about civilized versus uncivilized society, making the real life Yanomamo tribe look like vicious cannibal man apes. In truth, the Yanomamo people are some of the friendly, smart civilize tribes in the Amazon. They are not truly cannibalistic although the Yanomamo do partake in a form of post-mortem ritual cannibalism. Another thing, while people might see the animal killings as the biggest complaint of the film because how brutal they kill it, and how long those scenes were like the insidious 'turtle' scene. At less, it looks like they ate it, or the natives ate it. The biggest complain for me are the rapes scenes. Not only on the team raping native women, but the native raping the team women for revenge. It was just unpleasant as hell. I couldn't watch any further for a while after those scenes; until I took a long shower. I felt dirty watching this movie. It was just sick to the head. I have to give the movie so points here; they were really going for shock value, and I have to say they deliver on that, for sure. It work because of the cinéma vérité technique that the director learned from his mentor Roberto Rossellini, a style which people called hyper realistic. I just didn't like the shaky hand-held camera work, it really make my stomach turn. I doubt, I will watch it again because of that fact it makes me hurl not only the camera work but how graphic it is, but as less, I can say I watch it, and it did deliver on the hype. In a way, I would deeply interested in seeing what the piranha scene that was cut from the final film would have look like. It is a scene where group of Ya̧nomamö cutting off the leg of a Shamatari warrior and feeding him to piranha in the river. The underwater camera did not operate properly, and the piranha were difficult to control, so the director reportedly dropped the scene. Due to its graphic content, there are several different versions of Cannibal Holocaust in circulation which are edited to certain degrees. The movie was barely made due to tension on set due to the exotic location and how much the actors were jerks to each other. These tensions were further heightened by unscrupulous payment practices. The actors barely got their money for the film. The film really misused the native extras. They basically were slaves, and work for free as they went unpaid for their work despite their involvement in numerous dangerous scenes. That's ugly. While the movie was trying to make a theme that show how bad modern society morals are in Italian media in this film by making the lost film crew heartless jerks. Behind the film, the director himself was treating the natives and his crew like trash. It's hard to take a director serious about talking about good morals when he himself doesn't practice good morals. Did the movie deserve to get banned? Not really. There are worst films than this, but this is high up there. Plus, banning it, only speak more people interest to see it. Censorship only works for a little while as the internet gave more freedom into seeing sick films such as this if a person wants to see it. I don't think all audiences who went to see this film are mental disturb. I can see people seeing it for curious reasons. Does it make them psychos for wanting to see this film? Not always.

27,tomgillespie2002,"Powerful, important cinema",9,13 August 2012,"Arguably the most infamous, controversial, and shocking of the video nasties, Ruggero Deodato managed to infuse a horror sub-genre flagging from over exposure, into a powerful piece of pseudo-documentary cinema, that still horrifies, traumatises and disgusts modern audiences. Italian genre cinema has always had a tendency towards imitation, and the cannibal sub-genre was one that was specific to the country, and by the mid 1970's was already dying a death. Deodato had made one previously, Last Cannibal World (1977), and he was pushed into making a ""sequel"" which he was reticent to do. However, after some time, he agreed, and seems to have taken the opportunity to actually comment on some very interesting observations on popular culture at the time.Another sub-genre exploded and created a huge batch of imitators, the Mondo cycle started in the 1960's with Paulo Cavara and Gualtiero Jacopetti's Mondo Cane (1962). With its use of documentary techniques, they delighted audiences with graphic depictions of exotic, bizarre, and archaic practises and incidents. However, as the market became flooded with imitation, the practices used to get the increasingly shocking images became questionable - these aggressive techniques even infiltrated news-media in the decade. What this means is that the creation of sensationalist stories (within the media and this cycle of pseudo-documentary/ethnographic expose), were often manipulated by the filmmakers, who would exploit the situation to make the story more interesting - exploitation which culminated in often horrific violence towards other humans. It is this element of pugnacious, and hostile form of reportage that inspired Deodato's new cannibal movie.The film could be said to be a two part structure. In the first we follow Harold Monroe (Robert Kerman), a New York professor, is lead into the Amazon jungles in search of a group of filmmakers who had disappeared some time previously. Here the group encounter a primitive cannibal tribe, and discover film cans, left behind. The second half of the film focuses mainly upon the screenings of the shocking footage captured by the ill-fated documentary makers. From this ""found footage"" the professor, television producers, and us film spectators are shown the increasingly hostile tactics used to get shocking and scandalous images of an apparent primordial tribe of viscous people. But what it fundamentally highlights is the possibly more horrific nature of modernity, as it uses violence for the purpose of entertainment and procurement of profit, and it is this barbarism that becomes the four- person teams demise, and catastrophic deaths.A contentious issue with the film is the very real killings of animals on the screen, and this coupled with the special effects of human death, creates a disjointing juxtaposition making it appear entirely realistic. The woman who has been placed onto a stake which protrudes through her mouth appears very real. These juxtapositions also created much of the controversy surrounding the project, and even lead to the director being accused of killing the cast. Even in its native Italy, the film was accused of being a genuine snuff film. It is no mistake that Deodato was able to use realist film vocabulary techniques to offer a complete experience - he had worked as assistant director on several of Roberto Rossellini's films (the master of Italian neo-realism). The film was inevitably banned in almost every country, and vilified as grotesque exploitation. But this claim is to completely miss the point of the film.The impact of this film still can be seen today. Whilst it is now belatedly getting the kind of critical acclaim that it deserves, it still has the power to agitate and appal anyone who watches it - it even manages to horrify some more fanatical gore-hounds. Besides this, the influence of the film can still be seen to this day. In 1999, The Blair Witch Project, arguably lifted Cannibal Holocaust's main premise, and the found footage concept is being exhaustively used to this day (Cloverfield (2008), TrollHunter (2010) and Chronicle (2012) to name just three). At last in the UK we are able to view the film in its entirety, and whilst the film is genuinely horrific, the importance of the uncut version will suggest that the ""meaning"" can be fully explored. It is an incredible achievement of horror cinema, and should be seen by everyone (well, I wouldn't show it to a child - even though I saw a version at a young age). Powerful, important cinema, with an incredible amount to say about the savagery of our modern times.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Cannibal Holocaust
28,filipemanuelneto,A sick movie made by sick people.,1,4 December 2017,"This film is another sick cinematic experience of Italian provenance. Considered by many the goriest film already made to date, its a bad example for international cinema in that it shows, virtually, everything that a quality film should never show.The plot is simple: after the disappearance of a film crew from a documentary in the middle of a remote area of ​​the Amazon Rainforest, an expert is sent to find out what happened. However, the region is inhabited by ferocious cannibal tribes. Therefore, the film mixes a bit the found footage style with a mockumentary. The director, Ruggero Deodato, focused on realism to the point that he was arrested on charges ranging from depravity to qualified murder (he was only saved from life imprisonment when the actors killed in the film appeared before the judge, alive and in very good health). So the movie is not for anyone and it's not that movie that you show to your girlfriend or mother. In fact, the human deaths were staged, with extreme graphic realism, but there are actually scenes of executions that were included in the film, in addition to having been killed several animals during the filming (where were the Greenpeace guys then?).

That wasn't true, and ""only"" the animals were killed. That cruelty doesn't not make this movie to be more realistic, it only made it more disgusting.The acting is mediocre, just as the story (I guess that's because most of the cast only worked in porn movies before.) The script was incredibly pretentious and vain.Cannibal Holocaust, is in my opinion, nothing more than overrated garbage, directed by one talentless hack, Ruggero Deodato, a filmmaker who never made a single good film.I just don't understand why some people could say that this disgusting trash was something ""beautiful ""? yeah,sure, if you consider rape or see how a idiot open a turtle and show his organs in a full frontal scene as something nice to watch.

30,TheMovieDiorama,"Cannibal Holocaust, although unorthodox, does present savagery through innovation.",6,22 December 2018,"There I was eating a couple of bland Rich Tea biscuits, when all of a sudden an innocent monkey is decapitated with a tribesman devouring its tiny skull. Safe to say, I did not eat anymore Rich Tea biscuits. Often regarded as the ""most controversial film of all-time"", naturally I prepped my mind and body for the worst. Although I do not condone various practices during its filming, Cannibal Holocaust surprised me. There is textual substance to be found beneath the excessive gore and sexual violence. A professor travels to the Amazon to locate missing filmmakers who were creating a documentary on the ""Green Inferno"". When he finds their skeletal remains and the films, he returns back to civilisation to watch the footage. A fundamental question is raised as the documentary reveals its true nature. Are the civilised just as savage as the primitive? Are we the true cannibals of humanity? By pioneering the ""found footage"" technique, this film was widely regarded for its shocking realism (so much so that the director was accused of murder). And with this technique, the exploration into societal savagery is a thorough bloody presentation. The blood-soaked actions of the tribal individuals are reactions from the filmmakers who cause destruction to their village. Sexually assaulting their women and unnecessarily murdering the inhabitants. Their monstrous actions are exaggerated to absurd levels that, whilst frequently feels derivative, does highlight the violence ensued by white colonials. The acting was mediocre and the editing often haphazard, but the amateur style offers a contagious charm that makes the whole scenario feel even more real.However, despite the BBFC cutting these scenes out, I do take issue with the obscene amount of animal cruelty. No creature should be slaughtered for the sake of art. So slicing tarantulas and snakes with a machete is a no from me. Dragging a turtle onto shore and removing its insides is a no from me. Authenticity has its limits. The first thirty minutes were particularly slow as you patiently wait for the controversy to ensue (a disadvantage of acquiring such a title). However the pace picks up as soon as the professor interacts with the tribe. It's also worth mentioning that the act of sexual violence was completely unnecessary and seems like its sole purpose is just to justify the damnation of these documentarians. They've already done enough to be viewed as the antagonists, therefore proving this scene to be nothing more than obscenity. So whilst I condemn certain excessive segments and filmmaking techniques, there is a surprising amount of substance. Just make sure you don't eat anything as you watch it...",Cannibal Holocaust

Every Horror fan talks about it even if he/she has not watched it. You may love or hate ""Cannibal Holocaust"" but you can't deny that it deserves some credit for many reasons. First, this one started the ""lost shocking footage"" idea. It also created the myth that it's events were real. Of course everything was a publicity trick that didn't have enough success back in the 80's but it has awaken the curiosity of many generations of Horror fans.""Cannibal Holocaust"" is more than a famous exploitation movie. The fact that it is banned in 250 countries is just a fact. Once you watch it, you will understand the greatness of it. It's a powerful piece of cinema that displays the Horrors of humanity in society and in the wilderness. As many people have written on their reviews, this movie makes you think ""who are the real savages""?. You can't change nature's way, and when you irrumpt it with violence, and no respect, things can get really awful. The first expedition group humiliated the savage's most important traditions and their way of living just for fortune, fame, and for morbid purposes. Their ambition went too far and that is why they found cruel fates. But they asked for it without knowing it. That happens when you do not show respect for humanity.About the animal real killings, I must admit that it can be justified as part of Deodato's experiment. The killings were not for a shocking purpose, but for understand the nature of the message he is sending to the audience. We learn more about how these animals are useful for humans who live in the wilderness. There have been many heated debates towards this topic but there isn't an uniform opinion for it. Deodato's social message is very clear. Humans are savages by nature, but the question is again, ""who are the real savages""?. After watching the ""lost"" footage of the first group, we can feel repulsion for the so called civilized humans. The savages didn't do harm to anyone before the civilized humiliated them. After the t.v. executives watched the footage, the movie ends in a silent way that will always leave you shocked. That is a perfect ending. There is nothing more to say after understanding why they found cruel fates. To spoil how they were killed and what they saw (which is the strong point of the movie) would be unfair for those who haven't seen the movie because the shock factor is very high and it's very impressive to the point that a first time view is a great experience. The truth is that ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is more than a cult Horror movie, it's more of a myth. This movie is among the best Horror movies of all time and it deserves to be watched by any Horror fan. Well, maybe not for those who are easily grossed or for the fainted of the heart.This is truly a Horror experience because it shocks, disgusts, and makes you think.",Cannibal Holocaust

34,Anonymous_Maxine,Ruggero Deodato has truly achieved a milestone new level of depravity and meaningless violence,1,10 November 2008,"What you have in Cannibal Holocaust is a story about a group of people from NYU that go to document a culture of cannibals and never come back. Not that the story matters. Having watched I think three cannibal movies now (this is three more than the average healthy adult's lifetime recommended dosage), it has become clear to me that they are nothing more than exhibitions of movie violence and sickness. And in that area, the movie succeeds brilliantly. It is so tasteless and so disgusting that it's amazing that things like this ever get made.And not just for the animal mutilations or the feces flinging (yeah that really happens in this movie. It's not just a t-shirt for smartass teenagers) or the orgies of misogynistic violence, but of course there are tons of naked natives in the movie, many of them obviously underage. But I guess that is just not a concern in whatever country the movie was distributed from. I am guessing we are meant to be impressed by the feeding scenes, since logic would lead you to believe that that is what a cannibal film centers on. If so, maybe that explains why all the natives must smear their food all over their faces before they eat it, although I am at a loss to explain why women are regularly mutilated, dismembered, fornicated with and THEN eaten. It becomes clear early on that surely someone in the group of NYU people must snap, unable to take what they're seeing anymore, and of course it does happen.One guy, since the natives 'distrust' them (maybe it was all that shooting?) decides to strip naked to ""become like them."" Evidently this man has never seen the whiteness of his naked self before, but the island girls don't seem to mind. As soon as this awkward white guy strips off his khakis a whole group of naked girls run up to him and start grab-assing for a little while. Hey, maybe cannibals aren't so bad after allOh, but minutes later, the group are forced to eat human, as is to be expected. The natives gleefully shove entrails in their faces as they inexplicably turn into savages for the purpose of this bizarre plot. Why the instant and total descent into barbarism? I have no idea, the movie isn't intelligent enough to explain such a thing, all it knows how to do is show you something that you would be much better off never seeing.A giant turtle is torn apart alive with bare hands while the cameraman zooms in for an extreme close-up so as not to miss a single revolting detail, a monkey gets its face cut off, a backwoods amputation is cauterized with a hot machete and, when the poor amputee immediately dies, the rest of the crew forget seconds later, laughing and joking in the subsequent footage. This is, of course, all documentary footage that they're watching of a past film crew. It seems that these mental giants went into the village and started screaming and shooting their guns and burning the village, and then wondered why they were massacred. It is not exactly a massive intellectual surge when one of the new crew says ""these people probably think WE'RE the savages!""Yeah, what tipped you off? The burning of their village or the fornicating in the ashes? Clearly this is meant to be the movie's thinly disguised message. White people are savages at least as much as the people that we think of as savages. Oh and in case you didn't happen to catch that message when it smacked you in the head numerous times like a ton of bricks, at one point the ""civilized"" people grab one of the native girls and rape her, trying to show her the errors of her ways. Clever.These people are nothing like any manner of civilized people, they are absolute degenerates and should be imprisoned. They even shout for joy when they find a woman impaled on a pole. What the hell is this garbage?But in watching a movie like this, it seems to me that it is the people that would make and distribute something like this that are the savages. At least horror movies are FUN, even bad ones. And this is not a bad horror movie. It's not a horror movie at all, I don't know what you would call it, but it is truly horrible. A mother gives birth to an infant in the movie, for example. The baby is taken away from it's mother, drenched in blood and then buried in the mud while the mother is beaten to death with rocks. There is a point in the movie where the utterly talentless writer, evidently unaware of how breathtakingly obvious his story is, has one of his characters spoon-feed you the real meaning of the movie:""Today people want sensationalism. The more you rape their senses, the happier they are.""This sentence betrays a staggering lack of understanding of film-going audiences, but at least it is a flawless description of the thought behind the movie.

37,kevin_robbins,I'd score this a 10/10 and highly recommend it.,10,27 April 2021,"Cannibal Holocaust (1980) is a movie I recently watched Shudder. This Italian gem focuses on a group of adventures who head to Africa to document tribes and get a little stir crazy and out of their lane before the locals finally need to put them in their place. This movie is directed by the legendary director Ruggero Deodato (The Barbarians) and stars Robert Kerman (No Way Out), Francesca Ciardi (The Tunnel), Perry Pirkanen (Cannibal Feeox) and Salvatore Basile (Collateral Damage). This movie is awesome in every way - both the story itself and the story behind it. There are some unbelievable scenes in this - the turtle, pig, woman on the stake, the decaying woman in the water, the eye and knife opening...I could go on and on. The fact they are really catching and killing that turtle on camera is unbelievable. So is the fact Ciardi fought every scene to not have nudity and by the end of the movie you've scene every inch of her. The stories of how relentless Deodato was as a director is both sad and legendary. Those are real tribes people he used on this movie, though they sadly never got paid for their performances. The sex scenes were legendary in this movie too and the actors actually broke up with their spouses after they finished recording because they knew their significant others would be infuriated after seeing the movie and they didn't want to deal with it. The scenes of people vomiting during the turtle scene were real, people all over the set were vomiting and the director had his film crew run around recording it because they could only do the take once. Same for the pig getting shot scene, they really shot the pig and as the commentary is happening the trying not to cry while delivering his lines because he flew to the set with the pig; and again, they only had one take to capture the scene, that's why the actor turns his back to the camera after giving play by play of their actions so you can't see him crying. This movie is absolutely amazing and an all time classic. I absolutely love it and it should be part of your collection. I'd score this a 10/10 and highly recommend it.",Cannibal Holocaust
38,barnabyrudge,A worryingly well-made cannibal horror movie. Unlovely and tough to watch... but very powerful.,6,13 September 2011,"I'd toyed with the idea of watching Cannibal Holocaust for a long time before actually taking the plunge. I suppose I was wary of the film's reputation as a piece of extreme cinema, and subconsciously kept putting off seeing it. Having finally viewed it – and, what's more, in its uncut version containing all the animal killings, the longest available ""Road To Hell"" footage, and all the other gory moments – I must say I'm rather surprised. Surprised that I admire the film when I expected to hate it; surprised that in parts the film is remarkably well made; and surprised that an Italian cannibal film of all things manages to be so prescient in its depiction of media sensationalism.A group of four young film-makers vanish in the Amazon while making a documentary. A few months later, anthropologist Harold Monroe (Robert Kerman) sets off to find out what happened to them. After various adventures Monroe and his guides eventually find a group of natives, the Yacumo tribe, who have had contact with the film-makers. They push on further into the jungle, to the unexplored regions peopled by much more dangerous and isolated tribes like the Yanomamo and the Shamatari, where Monroe eventually locates the barely recognisable remains of the film crew. Amazingly, the movie reels they have shot are still intact and Monroe manages to persuade the tribesmen to let him have them in exchange for a tape recorder. The ""recovered footage"" shows director Alan Yates (Carl Gabriel Yorke), script writer Faye Daniels (Francesca Ciardi) and cameramen Mark Tomaso (Luca Barbareschi) and Jack Anders (Perry Pirkanen), journeying into the depths of the jungle where they use increasingly unethical and violent methods to get the footage they want. Eventually, the Yanomamo tribe turn on the film-makers and brutally slay them, their horrible deaths captured on film as the documentary crew desperately try to escape.For its first half, Cannibal Holocaust is not particularly good. This part is a standard jungle expedition adventure with typically bad acting, wooden dialogue and bursts of gruesome violence. Where the film suddenly and unexpectedly makes you sit up and take note is in its second half, referred to in the film as the ""Green Inferno"" segment. Using an effective cinéma vérité style, director Ruggero Deodato shows the exploits of the film crew in the jungle. He uses scenes of real animal cruelty to shock the audience and knock them off balance, then moves onto realistically simulated ""human"" horrors such as rape, impalement, beheading, cannibalism and more. These simulated scenes have added believability because our senses have already experienced the onslaught of real cruelty and death. Deodato relentlessly shows how unscrupulous and corrupt the film-makers are, and how they will commit the most horrific acts against animals and natives just as long as they get their film made. The problem is that Cannibal Holocaust becomes the very thing it tries to condemn - a piece of sensationalism. It's hard to accept this fierce assault on the immorality of the media when the film itself resorts to the same offensive immorality. Nonetheless, this is an effective and disturbing horror film which should be seen at least once, if only to experience the raw cinéma vérité sequences (which surely inspired later ""lost footage"" movies, most notably The Blair Witch Project). There isn't a single moment here that will make you jump, but there are many appallingly cruel moments that will play on your mind for a long time afterwards. Tough viewing.",Cannibal Holocaust
39,drownnnsoda,The art of distaste,9,8 May 2014,"""Cannibal Holocaust"" lies within the annals of the horror genre with an immense reputation looming over it— I, like many, had heard various things about the film over the years, with the most general common threads being that it was disgusting and utterly abhorrent. Watching it for the first time, I actually didn't know what the film was about, and my assumptions of it being a mindless splatterfest were slowly eroded over the course of the film; aside from being utterly shocked by its raw depiction of violence, I was simultaneously shocked by the density of its social thematics and the skilled presentation of its imagery.The film essentially focuses on an NYU anthropology professor who travels to the Amazon to observe local cannibal tribes, and comes back with footage from a group of young documentarians who filmed there several months earlier before disappearing. Ruggero Deodato presents the film in a framed narrative which tells the story of the anthropology professor as well as the persons whose footage he has obtained, which is presented to us in its gritty 8mm format, cinéma vérité style. The double narrative is just one of many unusual and interesting things happening in this film, but it's worth noting because it's remarkably well balanced. As has been noted, there is a jarring sense of realism to the cinematography; comparisons have been made to National Geographic pictorials, which I believe are apt comparisons as I at times felt like I was watching a National Geographic documentary gone terribly, terribly wrong. Narratively there are shades of Joseph Conrad lurking under the surface, which come into play particularly during the problematic last half of the film, in which the social commentary comes to the forefront; it's up to you whether or not the message is lost in its gratuitous translation, and even then, the message itself is problematic and loaded with historical implications that run deeper than the film can accommodate, but it is no less a noble and impressionistic effort in forcing its audience to think about what they have just seen.The violence— oh, yes, the violence. It's gruesome, no doubt, but I think it's actually less graphic than most people believe it to be. The reason it is so disturbing is because it is presented so unflinchingly, and the special effects themselves are shockingly impressive— far more grit and realism than something you'd see in a Lucio Fulci film of the time period. There is actual filmed murder of animals, which is an entire issue in and of itself, and something that did irk me as someone who has a moral position against killing animals. Did I like it? Of course not— who would? In a film of such horrendous subject matter though, it is oddly fitting. Problematic in so many ways, yes, but I do believe there is a significance to seeing actual death on film (of animals), considering how removed most people are about what killing a living creature actually looks like.Overall, I got way more than I bargained for with ""Cannibal Holocaust."" It's a film whose moral implications run far deeper than the gorefest reputation it has attained, and that was something that caught me completely off guard. It's uncompromising and often scarily realistic, and, above all else, makes a confused albeit profound statement about what it means to live on this savage planet. 9/10.",Cannibal Holocaust

I found that the most disturbing thing about this film was the ""social-commentary"" angle that the film took towards the end.

Gruesome, disturbing and brilliant, but often misunderstood, ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is not the average 80s cannibal exploitation flick one might expect, but an utterly unique stroke of genius that can not really be compared to any other movie. ""Cannibal Holocaust"" begins when New York anthropology Professor Harold Monroe (Robert Kerman) is sent to the South American jungle in order to investigate the disappearance of a team of documentary film makers. Known for their hazardous journeys in order to achieve original footage, filmmakers Alan Yates (Carl Gabriel Yorke), Faye Daniels (Fraqncesca Giardi), Jack Anders (Perry Pirkanen) and Mark Tomaso (Luca Barbareschi) have disappeared after traveling to he Amazon jungle in order to make a documentary about the 'Green Inferno', where the last cannibal tribes are reputed to live... I don't want to spoil the most brilliant moments of this masterpiece, so in case you haven't seen it, I advise you not o read on, but to rent, or, even better, buy he uncut version and watch it as quickly as possible. It is impossible to explain why this movie is so brilliant, without giving away parts of the plot, so...Warning! SPOILERS ahead! - ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is a stunning film from the beginning, but what makes this movie such an outstandingly brilliant masterpiece is its second half, in which we become aware that it is actually not the so-called savages who are the monsters, but the ambitious film makers who don't have the slightest scruples to murder, rape, mutilate and commit all sorts of abhorrent atrocities in order to get shocking footage.Since its release, this film has been one of the most controversial (maybe THE most controversial) and widely condemned films ever made. Moralists have condemned it for the violence, and because they misunderstood the movie. Furthermore, the likes of animal protectors (who probably don't give a damn about human rights, but who scream murder as soon as a rat gets hurt) keep complaining about the (real) animal killings in the movie. This is debatable, of course, but I find it to be legitimate. The animals were actually eaten by the crew, and the scenes do add a raw and shocking mood. Worst of all, Ruggero Deodato was even accused of actually killing human beings for his movie, which was of course proved to be absolute nonsense, and which is even more outrageous regarding the fact that it is the main aim of this film to criticize the unscrupulousness of some media.End Of Spoilers. - The raw and unique atmosphere in ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is built by the shocking story and documentary-style film-making as well as some great camera work and the mesmerizing score by Riz Ortolani. The performances are furthermore great and very authentic. I can understand that this is too brutal and disturbing for many people, and those who are easily offended should definitely avoid this film, but to all others this is a must-see. Director Ruggero Deodato created something incomparably shocking, brilliant and unique, and, as far as I am considered, ""Cannibal Holocaust"" alone makes Deodato a genius. All said, ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is a stunning, disturbing, brilliant and absolutely unique masterpiece of film-making that not only Horror fans, but every serious lover of cinema (who isn't too easily offended) MUST see.

42,Jonny_Numb,"""It's offensive, disgusting...it's INHUMAN!""",5,12 January 2003,"Amen, brother.""Cannibal Holocaust"" is hailed by gore fans and despised by the casual viewer, and for good reason--this is one of the most grueling, relentless exercises in human savagery ever lensed.  But is it any good?  Being a fan of Italian horror, I have to say yes, but just barely.  It delivers unflincing scenes of rape, dismemberment, real animal slaughter, and other generally deviant behavior, but the angle it's presented in simply doesn't work.Robert Kerman (The Emerald Jungle) plays a college professor in search of a film crew in a South American jungle.  He witnesses several atrocities committed by the natives (mild compared to the rest of the film), dines on human flesh, and eventually is led to a macabre shrine where he finds the footage the crew shot.  Back in the States, a bunch of stuffy TV executives want to broadcast the film for a slice of sensationalist reality, but Kerman refuses and we settle into the centerpiece of the movie.  We watch, with growing horror, as the film crew indulges in rape, torture, and murder, all for their 'art,' with the camera picking up every second; the characters are hateful cretins who are obviously desensitized to human suffering BUT...when all the ammo in their guns runs out, the reality of the situation strikes them, and their atrocities are avenged (and then some).""Cannibal Holocaust"" is a repulsive, nihilistic film with a silly angle that presents it as 'social commentary' (a bad idea, this is pulpy dreck at best).  It acutally reminded me of ""15 Minutes"" in that it goes about its business in a mindlessly savage manner.  However, I appreciated Robert Kerman's character, obviously designed to not just speak out for his personal disgust but for the disgust of the audience, as well--he's the moral backbone of this film.  Also, the violence is very effective and well-done, and Ruggero Deodato directs the repulsive proceedings with style (the use of hand-held camera is effective).

43,RainDogJr,You know where you are? You're in the jungle baby. You're gonna die,9,20 August 2008,"I have seen somewhere, I guess in a t-shirt, a phrase like ""who is the beast?"" with an image of bullfighting. Cannibal Holocaust in part has something related with that question. Practically we have two different views on the same subject, one of them by balanced persons who are there for a reason that we can understand but the other by persons who's reasons are simply their own curiosity or better their own way to make money with something ""shocking"". I will be honest I bought this DVD exactly in January, the very first days of 2008. By then I had heard the enough things about Cannibal Holocaust to make me had the enough desires to check it out and by then it was a complete surprise to find the DVD at my local store. Even my cousin made fun about that when I wanted to buy The Dentist (Brian Yuzna, 1996) saying something like ""sure just to put it away like Cannibal Holocaust"". Later I borrowed this film to a friend and from him I heard again all the situations with the animals, especially the turtle sequence of course. Those situations made that this film wasn't the great one that it could have been and that's because those were contradictions for the film itself. Forget for an instant those horrible scenes, we have a ""normal"" first part but of course we are tense but at the same time we learn here how possible is to make contact with the natives. They have their own world there, a world that was completely disturb by some ""civilized"" persons that were there to show the ""horrors"" of the Green Inferno. Without watching the reels of those ""civilized"" persons we realize the type of persons that they were and we know the thoughts of their own familiars about them. On that way the film is great and the already-talked message is a very important part on that way. Harold Monroe (Robert Kerman) has many great lines, not only the last ones of the film. ""Would you like people to make money off your misery?"" is one of them. Of course not even the fact that Monroe saw the natives could stop those executives in their way to show the footage of the ""civilized"" team but ironically the footage itself was enough. My point when I write about the animal footage was that the film has a strong point with the fact that people are interested in violence, obviously the crew conformed by Alan Yates (Gabriel Yorke), Faye Daniels (Francesca Ciardi), Jack Anders (Perry Pirkanen) and Mark Tomaso (Luca Giorgio Barbareschi), the ""civilized"" team, knew that and they were on that business. I'm totally agreed with director Sergio Leone who in a letter to Ruggero Deodato wrote, ""The second part is a masterpiece of cinematographic realism"". I think it could have been as powerful as it is without the animal footage, footage that obviously place Deodato as one of the ""civilized"" team for a way to say it, really disturbing stuff. But at the same time this footage is part of Cannibal Holocaust, in that way I found the introduction by the distributors of the film from the DVD quite accurate so in other words if you are going to watch this film you must watch the uncut version of it as if you can you must check the interview with Robert Kerman. Then Cannibal Holocaust really was what I expected and thanks to that probably I will not watch it again or at least not very soon. Even that I found in this a really worth watching film I really can't recommend it and it is simply as if you have heard stuff about it and you have that curiosity to know by yourself if everything is truth well I guess sooner or later you will watch it and as happened with a friend of mine, if somebody comes to me talking about Cannibal Holocaust believing that is a cult masterpiece I will borrow it since is a film to see once. -""You know where you are?

44,p-stepien,Exploitation at its worst? Or at its finest?,5,20 August 2010,"A documentary crew ends up lost in the very depths of the Amazon. Rather than let the mystery linger a search party is sent after them. Apart from two locals trackers (the best available) the only other participant is professor Harold Monroe (Robert Kerman), a world renowned anthropologist. The fearless threesome equipped only with weapons and a first-aid kit delve into the unknown - their main weapon is wisdom and common sense...A breakthrough movie, which is not by no means for everyone. Most people may not be able to throat this extreme exploitation movie, which looks as impressive from filmmaker's point of view as it did 30 years ago. It remains no surprise that the Italian jury actually believed this movie was no movie. Some of the scenes are absolutely mind-boggling (even if the provoke the occasional hurl) and I have no idea how they filmed the impalement scene with such realism. It is a cinematographic masterpiece that I believe will never get old and as a horror movie packs just as strong a wallop as back in the days. It needn't be said that that in itself is an immense accomplishment. Very rough, bleak, down-to-earth with a documentary feel to it ""Cannibal Holocaust"" remains breakthrough and a movie to which all similar pseudo-documentaries strive to achieve and never manage to (with ""District 9"" being the closest).Much smarter and better made that the similar ""Cannibal Ferox"" it is best not to exaggerate it's message. The director himself stated that he had no underlying deep thoughts whilst making his ultimate cannibal flick. All in all the message is quite obvious and put straight in your face making the modern civilisation not any better (and probably worse) than the man-eating primitives. The title ""Cannibal Holocaust"" fits perfectly as it basically brings to the forefront the cruelty and immorality of the modern world with the cannibals at least having a clear if somewhat gross set of social rules. Not sure how self-aware the director was, but it was very tongue in cheek to make a genuine social commentary about exploitation and snuff movies by... making a nasty exploitation flick...After so much praise why don't I give it a higher rank? Basically because this isn't my piece of horror cake. I didn't enjoy watching the movie or will not want to re-watch it. I also found the meaningfulness of the social commentary gravely exaggerated (although I must admit it sells the message well and it is very cleverly done). Also I was very much offended by all the animal cruelty and found most of it very unnecessary. Apparently Ruggero Deodata agrees and would probably never go down that route nowadays. All in all if you're in to this kind off exploitation cinema - a must see. If not - enter at your own risk.",Cannibal Holocaust
45,Matt_Layden,"The most disturbing, realistic, brutal movie...ever""",6,22 September 2005,"A New York anthropologist travels to the jungles of South America with two local guides to find out what happened to a documentary film crew which disappeared nearly a year earlier. After a long search and encountering a few primitive tribes, they find the remains of the crew and several reels of their undeveloped film. While in the US, the anthropologist views the material on the films.So this is the film that they did not want you to see, after seeing it, I can see why. Here is a film that has hundreds of people who love it, and just as many who hate it. Mostly because of the violent content within the film, it's too raw and horrific for some, but for others, they love every minute of it. Myself, I'm in that one percent who's indifferent.This is a grind house picture, where it's basically two stories into one movie, the first half of the movie is the search party who goes into the jungle looking for the film crew. The second half of the movie is the actual film footage from the documentary crew, which portion of the film I liked more is hard to decide, because what we see in the first half is shocking to us, we have not seen this before, it's new and it's brutal, but happens in the second half of the movie is more brutal, but not as shocking, because you are expecting the uncomfortably of the film to grow, and it does.This movie influenced the likes of films like The Blair Witch Project. Here is a movie that goes down in history as one of the most shocking movies of all time, does it deserve that title? Well, let's see, during the 90 some odd minutes of the film, be ready for: 3 different rape scenes, full-frontal nudity (both male and female), decapitations, real-life animal killings, guts ripping, people burning, torture, the most disturbing abortion scenes ever, limbs being chopped off, people getting impaled, bodies being hacked to bits and guts being ripped out and what makes it worse is that it's not that kind of ""Dead-Alive"" tongue in cheek gore, it's so realistic and disturbing.The music is beautiful, the theme song that plays throughout it amazing and a high point in this film. Don't pick it up for acting, or dialouge...but then again I wouldn't imagine someone doing that. This is a horror movie for those disturbed horror fans, those who want to see this movie to see what all the talk is about, brace yourself, you're in for some pretty horrific stuff. I'm not going to go into the whole political aspect of animal killings, but those were some of the hardest scenes to watch in this film.People are put off by the violence, so they fail to see what it's about. How we today are more curious about what's bad in the world, then what is good, how the journalist focus more on violent issues. Was it overdone? But then again, maybe it was just the right amount. It also shows how we as a culture are insensitive and ignorant to others, even if it is a cannibal tribe.I did dig this film, for it's unique style, that did come out before BWP faze. I love all kinds of horror movies, and this is one not to miss, of course if you can handle this type of stuff. The DVD is limited to about 10,000 copies, so if you want a copy pick it up fast. Oh and did I forget to mention that during it's release it was banned in almost 60 countries.",Cannibal Holocaust
46,slayrrr666,A Classic in every sense of the word,10,9 May 2007,"""Cannibal Holocaust"" is a really hard to get through film, but still manages to be a classic.**SPOILERS**Following a high profile news group disappearance, anthropologist Prof. Harold Monroe, (Robert Kerman) is sent to the Amazon to find them, and along with trackers Chaco Losojos, (Salvatore Basile) and Felipe Ocanya, (Ricardo Fuentes) go into the jungle. While searching, they find a small tribe of warriors in the jungle, known as the Yanomamo, and are accepted into the tribe. He finds that the Yanomamo have canisters that the film group, consisting of director Alan Yates, (Carl Gabriel Yates) his girlfriend Faye Daniels, (Francesca Ciardi) and cameramen Mark Tomaso, (Luca Barbareschi) and Jack Anders, (Perry Pirkanen) had left behind. Taking the footage back to New York, he screens the footage and becomes appalled at seeing the cruelty and torture the group inflicts in the film. As they get more and more violent towards the tribesmen in the jungle, he senses that they will turn and seek revenge, all culminating in the foreboding last reel of footage to be screened.The News: This is one of the best horror films around and the cream of the crop of the cannibal sub-genre. Simply, what gives the film it's power and enjoyment is the fact that this is one of the strongest stories ever told. The first half of the film is a normal jungle adventure, replete with the viewing of the native rites, acceptance into the tribe, and other assorted jungle adventures. It isn't ground-breaking but it gets the job done, keeping the viewer focused on what's happening and setting up the trump card that is the final half. This is the main footage of the lost crew and is a whole different story. Consisting of raw, hand-held images shot from two cameras by a quartet of film-makers as they callously tromp through the jungle, committing sexual and violent acts against the ""mud people"" and even offing an animal or two in the process. This is also where the film's heart comes into play, where it makes the valiant charge that civilized man is no more savage than the people out in the jungle. The great trick that this pulls off is that the film is essentially a non-violent protest that attacks the civilized man and the media for their ability to spin any story to a sensationalized account. This can only be possible with a peaceful tribe being assaulted by a rowdy and extreme outsider force, the camera-crew, coming in and destroying their way of life purely for ratings. Conducting extreme amounts of carnage, including setting fire to a series of huts and forcing the occupants to stay inside, raping villagers in full view of others and then reminding themselves to become serious and poignant because they're being filmed. This even occurs during the abortion sequence, where they visibly force the natives around so that the camera filming can get a better shot. They also are the main ones who dish out the animal violence, as they slaughter several creatures and the natives merely do one in a really quick shot. Aside from the ending retribution, all of the violence in the film is caused by the crew towards nature or the tribe, and as they are nearly all done in the last segment, this really helps to sell the message of the savage man and the media. Away from the message it makes, this is one of the greatest horror films around. It assembles a series of images that are both violent and disturbing, but in the end, they are no more graphic nor more violent than any other gore-fest. Instead, it is the tone and nature of the violence. Some of it is rawly primitive and all of it is unflinching in detail. Even more, this approach makes the viewer a participant in the carnage. As much as the lost film crew, it is the audience's demand for more blood, darker thrills, that drives the acts on screen. The gore gets extreme, as legs get severed, multiple rapes, a castration, a chest-cracking scene, eye-gouging, a woman impaled to the point of the stick coming out of her mouth, organ eating and so much more in here that are simply brutal. This brings up the biggest and most controversial segment of the film, which is the actual animal slaughter present. The on screen killing of animals is completely indefensible, of course, and are nothing more than a nauseating nature snuff film, the verisimilitude of these sequences causes the viewer to then question the reality of everything else on screen. Indeed, many of the more memorable moments come with the unnecessary torment and torture of innocent creatures, but such blatant abuse is a necessity. It sets up the whole potential premise of the film. When we see a pig being shot or a sea-turtle gutted and chopped up, the reaction is instant. They have instant impact, before being identified for their fake-ness. Since they allow the viewer to put up barriers and prepare ourselves for the next instance, the result is that it really happened. However, the cruelty obliterates any chance of becoming a credible social commentary. In no way, shape or form is murdering helpless creatures suitable for entertainment. What's most sickening about these scenes, is the way the actors behave, appearing to enjoy these barbaric acts. It makes the whole affair much more unsettling. Even still, this is one of the best films in the genre.The Final Verdict: This is one of the hardest films to get into, but it's well-worth it, not just for the extreme gore and story, but for being a smart film as well. While the animal carnage is hard to get through, those who can will find a film with a lot to love, but that is one big obstacle in itself.Rated UN/NC-17: Extreme Graphic Violence, continuous animal violence, Full Male and Female Nudity, several sex scenes and several Rapes",Cannibal Holocaust
47,Chase_Witherspoon,Still the best,8,29 September 2011,"Pretty straight-forward yet effective storyline has a group of intrepid documentary film-makers, immersed in the jungles of the Amazon, running afoul the otherwise placid locals after they exploit them for the sake of their documentary. Recovery team (led by porn actor Kerman aka R.Bolla no less) discovers evidence of the expedition that reveals a harrowing tale of exploitation and subsequent gruesome retributions (gruesome being the operative word).Despised for its blatant animal cruelty, fortunately there's a DVD release of this previously banned video nasty that omits the ghastly scenes in which defenceless animals are brutally killed for the sake of celluloid. The DVD I purchased also featured a revealing documentary in which director Deodato explained the market forces that briefly made this sub genre a craze in Italy, and a marketable commodity to the western world.Memorable scenes abound, some perhaps too graphic for the average punter, and yet despite the often sadistic confrontations, there's still evidence that this is just a film - e.g. the mud-caked victim of the infidelity ritual is clearly a Caucasian woman in disguise (in fact it was the wardrobe manager who agreed to participate when no other willing candidate could be persuaded). Not exactly a work of art but an important film nonetheless.",Cannibal Holocaust
48,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Cannibal Holocaust"" is certainly a unique experience, and I'm glad I bought the DVD... But it's kind of... Overrated...",8,19 September 2009,"Ruggero Deodato's masterpiece of mayhem and torture, ""Cannibal Holocaust"" still holds up as one of the more disturbing films ever made. And indeed, it does have some interesting things to say about modern culture, and more specifically, the mass media's need to glamorize all, and throw integrity and conviction to the wind for the sake of ratings and money. But oftentimes this message (which was revealed to be unintentional by director Deodato) gets lost in one simple fact- this is a bloody, messy cannibal film...Exploitation to the max, the film is about a professor Harold Monroe, who has discovered the lost footage of four documentary filmmakers, while investigating their disappearance in the Amazon. He takes it back to New York, and develops the footage, screening it for an audience.The footage follows the filmmakers, Alan Yates, Faye Daniels and Jack Anders & Mark Tomaso. They were shooting a new film about the cannibal tribes of the area, and something went wrong.The film's imagery is quite stirring. Granted, I went into seeing this already having seen other films that used this movie's iconic ""Documentary style"" footage (notably including ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Cloverfield""), but this film's carnivorous and over-the-top contents really elevated it in terms of just how disturbing it was to watch.It is no secret that the film is controversial for it's violent and sexual content, and even I (who is almost never bothered by violence in films) was struck by just how devious the footage was. From the infamous animals killings (we see six real animals being slaughtered on screen, which hurt to watch), to horrific portrayals of murders (and worse), this movie really hits you in the gut.I will say, however, that this film also falls into a cliché that has emerged in the years since, which is that it is just too uneven at times. I feel that the movie's style almost dictated and necessitated a quicker pace, and it is a bit of a chore to watch, but all-in-all, it works.Also, I have to complain that for a ""horror"" film, it just isn't scary. It's borderline (but again unintentional) satire works quite well, and the film will generally make you feel awful, but it wasn't particularly scary. Then again, most horror films aren't truly scary, so this can be forgiven.I suppose the big problem I had with this film was the hype. I was lead to believe it was one of the best the horror genre has to offer, and while admirable, it just wasn't quite as good as I was lead to believe. But it still was very good.I'm gonna give this between and 8 and a 8.5 out of 10. It's very good, interesting, and for a film lover, almost necessary to see and own because of its status... But it's also slightly uneven. I would recommend this film to the strong of stomach.",Cannibal Holocaust
49,Howlin Wolf,"What if I threw a party, and nobody came?",4,9 June 2011,"Is this film really shocking? It shows a lot of stuff never before transplanted to screen, but without analysis, that can be more suitably categorised as 'groundbreaking'. For the most part, my sensibilities remained unshaken. Is it shocking, and am I just a sociopath? My rejection of the film's capacity to shock centers on a few psychological tenets:... Not when the makers themselves seemed uncomfortable enough that they kept cutting away to bystander/viewer shots every time the squeamish factor was building, no. When Pasolini showed audiences atrocity he trained the camera on it long enough for it to be really implanted in your mind, so you eventually found yourself just hoping it would end (from my perspective, anyway... ) The gore scenes in this movie can rightfully be called gruesome, but most of them were over in seconds.Besides, when I see a film with cannibal in its name, I don't go in expecting superior standards of deportment... The title kind of clues a prospective viewer in. These people are uncivilised, so of course they're going to be barbaric - it's a fundamental component of their nature. It has nothing to do with power or the intentional degradation of their fellow species.If some people turn savage after being exposed to savage conditions, that can at least be rationalised by desensitisation; man's inhumanity to man in order to consolidate a position of control is a concept that I find far more disturbing and disgusting, but that's just me...",Cannibal Holocaust

51,PimpinAinttEasy,A great work of art .....,9,14 January 2016,"Dear Ruggero Deodato, a day after 9/11, somebody should have sent a copy of your film to the Bush administration. They would never have invaded Iraq.Let me just say that Cannibal Holocaust is a tremendous achievement. What can you say about a 35 year old horror film that puts most modern horror films to shame? There is just so much to appreciate in your film.Let me start with the structure. Now I am no horror movie geek. But I think yours must be one of the first found footage films. Only a third of the movie is found footage. Unlike recent found footage films, your film involves characters reflecting on the found footage. I think this was a great idea as it provides context.Your fearless daring also needs to be appreciated. I heard you got arrested for some of the stuff you put on film. But I read that Sergio Leone congratulated your personally. So it did pay off in the end. I admit that I had to take my eyes off the screen during some of the animal violence. But I don't get all the outrage. I am on the side of the people who argue that animals get murdered everyday to feed families anyway. The scenes of violence between the tribal s and the civilized were also gruesome and disturbing. I can only imagine what went on during the shoot. I guess the crew must have had great fun. The sex scene was almost pornographic. I seriously doubt whether they were acting.And that score by Riz Ortolani. And the way you used it. Ortolani's score which conveys a sense of nostalgia and doom at the same time elevated this movie to another level. I cannot imagine this movie without the background score. Or this background score being used for another movie. The tune called ""Adulteress' Punishment"" played during the scenes of primitive violence is just art. The warm and summery ""Main Theme"" provides a great start to the film with the overhead shot of the forest.Last but not the least, the social commentary. I couldn't help but feel that the whole film is a critique of Western intervention in the affairs of third world nations. The two fighting tribes and the civilized Western man playing them against each other is almost certainly you having a go at American foreign policy. The civilized Western man and woman making love out in the open as the tribal s look on could be an allegory for the spread of debauched Western culture across the world. And the repeated shots of the tall skyscrapers in the Western cities. Were you implying that in the face of man's primitive urges, all the skyscrapers would amount to nothing - I wonder if the 9/11 terrorists watched CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST.Once again, your film is a tremendous achievement. I am not rating it a 10/10 due to the bad acting. But that is a minor complaint in a film like this.I hope to watch this in Blu Ray. And I will be watching more of your movies.Best Regards, Pimpin.(9/10)",Cannibal Holocaust
52,areatw,Bottom-of-the-barrel stuff,1,29 August 2017,"I reluctantly decided to watch the infamous 'Cannibal Holocaust' and found it to be every bit as shocking as people make out. It was by far the most uncomfortable experience I've ever had watching a film. From the sickening violence and killings to the torturing of animals and graphic rape scenes, this film is as morally low as they come.'Cannibal Holocaust' is not art - it's not even entertainment. How can anybody enjoy watching a coati being repeatedly stabbed as it screams in pain? Or a turtle being decapitated and then pulled to pieces? It's unnecessary, horrible to watch, and no right-minded human being should be getting pleasure out of it.This film is bottom-of-the-barrel stuff and makes for an extremely unpleasant and uncomfortable viewing experience. Unfortunately, it's also an unforgettable one.",Cannibal Holocaust
53,baumer,The mos t repulsive film ever made,1,22 February 2010,"So, lets get this straight. In the name of showing the irony of violence covered by the news and other mainstream media outlets, Deodato decides the best thing to do is to make a film where they kill every animal they can get their hands on. So what we are subjected to is the torture of a muskrat, the disembowelment of a tortoise, two monkey killings, the shooting of a pig and a spider and snake killing. Why? Why kill real animals? This is a movie, use props, or better yet, imply the killings. This disgusting show of violence towards other living things is enough to make someone puke.Then, as if that isn't enough, you have four of the most unlikable characters ever created. They rape villagers, torch their homes, enslave the same villagers and of course murder them. How exactly is this a film that has any redeeming values to it? Cannibal Holocaust is the most vile and disgusting film I have ever seen. We all know that people kill animals for food and clothing, but doing it in the name of art is very sad and has no place in this world.1/10",Cannibal Holocaust
54,ElijahCSkuggs,Surprisingly Serious,9,23 August 2006,"Going into Cannibal Holocaust I was anticipating an exploitation movie with really nothing to share besides...basically what everyone hears about the movie. I did NOT expect the movie to give you options on how you feel. I was expecting to be disgusted and disturbed. I did feel both of those feelings, but I felt much more. The movie takes itself 100% serious, with it's morals, it's production (especially the music), everything. This movie unfortunately is looked down upon by people just because of what they hear about it. I also was tentative to seeing this movie because of a certain aspect - the animal killings. They are killed for a purpose which they say in the movie. They even have a scene where an actor is repulsed by the death. Every killing was done fast except one, which was the one that bothered me most. It was not the turtle one (that still bothered me though).While watching a movie sometimes you know that this could be about as perfect as they can make it. This is one of those times. It is a masterpiece.I think sometimes that if they only had a different name for the movie more people would see it. Personally I love the title. I find it to be badass. But it's such a hardcore title, all you have to do is say it, and you will see a cringe on someone's face.The last line of the movie was exactly what you were supposed to think to yourself. I have my answer, that's for damn sure. I'm again surprised that this quote is not as popular as it should be.",Cannibal Holocaust
55,educallejero,What's the point here?,1,23 August 2018,"I enjoy disturbing ""art"". Well, I of course have limits (if you are going to be graphic, great, but at least lets just pretend you have a point?). 
So, this movie doesn't offend me at all. Yes, animals were really killed and that's insane. 
But this movie is old enough, so I get why they thought it wasn't a big deal. So. NOT OFFENDED BY THAT.But... this is just awful. Its like the opposite of the Blair Witch Project. While I read about how this movie just shows you how brutal ""civilized humans"" really are (at least as violent as the cannibals), the thing is, what we have to endure to get that point across is too boring, too gratiously graphic, and not engaging.And Im not really that sure that was the point from the filmmakers other than to ""shock"" people with its graphic violence and realistic snuff-like release (the actors ""killed"" in the movie went hiding, and it was believed that all the things that happened in the movie... really happened. Again, something similar was tried by the Blair Witch ProjecT). If the point was a metaphor on ""civilized"" humans, then there is no way you would kill real animals to do so.",Cannibal Holocaust
56,jluis1984,Brutal Masterpiece!,9,7 March 2006,"Ruggero Deodato's ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is probably one of the most talked about films of history; sadly, most of the controversy is not about the film itself, but about Deaodato's decision of having real animals killed in some scenes. While obviously what he did was wrong, the fact that this small detail overshadows the message of the film is a small proof of how underrated this legendary film is.""Cannibal Holocaust"" is without a doubt among the most beautiful and thought-provoking horror films ever done. While it displays horrific scenes of extreme violence, it carries a powerful and very human message with a class that very few films have. In the middle of the countless exploitation films, Deodatos' gem shines as a rough diamond with characteristics way different to the rest of the movies of its particular sub-genre.At the beginning, Professor Harold Monroe (Robert Kerman) goes to South America in an expedition to discover the fate of a group of young filmmakers who went to the Amazonian jungle in order to film a mysterious cannibal tribe. After Monroe befriends the cannibals, he is able to recover the lost films that depict what happened to the filmmakers. Back in the U.S., Monroe is shocked because the footage contains horrors worse than what he thought.The film is cleverly divided in two, at first we follow Monroe's expedition and his attempts to find the cannibal tribe. His humanistic philosophy is on display as he tries to understand this ancient culture which has kept its traditions intact over the centuries. Despite the light nature of the first part, it still contain shocking scenes but Deodato makes sure to point out that this is the way the Cannibals live, and that it is natural for them to be that way.The second part is the lost footage as Monroe prepares it to be studied. The tragedy of the filmmakers is depicted as we observe the surviving parts of what would be their documentary. As the professor discovers the shocking truth, an important question is raised, who was really the evil one? Deodato's minimalistic approach gives the film a realistic look, as at times the film looks like a real documentary. The subtle use of music enhances the atmosphere and perfectly sets the mood for the visuals. The acting is very good for the budget, as well as the make-up SFX. While ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is not as gory as the legend goes (it certainly is not a splatter-fest), it is a very disturbing film not only because the violence is very harsh, but because the reasons behind it are quite shocking.""Cannibal Holocaust"" is a film that many people talks about, but very few have actually seen. This movie is a very demanding experience not only for what is presented, but for what is implied; nevertheless, this film is a must-see for any film fan, not only fans of exploitation films, as Deodato's masterpiece is one of the films with more heart ever done. 9/10",Cannibal Holocaust
57,Squonkamatic,Worthy Of It's Reputation In All Departments,9,22 June 2006,"Make no mistake: Ruggero Deodato's CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST is one of those rare films that is exactly as remarkable and brutally effective as everyone says it is, and as unbearable as many more say: Yes, it made me feel sick, but it was impossible to turn away at the same time. This is not a film to be taken lightly, is difficult to dismiss, and should leave you a changed person after witnessing it for the first time. If it doesn't, then you need help.The term 'witnessing' is very fitting since the movie isn't watched in the same way you'd watch an episode of STAR TREK or whatever. The film happens to you, and you can't do anything to stop it. Sure you can switch it off but then you won't be able to remark upon the experience. I'll let others describe the plot or detail out events: What impressed me the most about the film was the way it approached it's subject matter, which can only be phrased as National Geographic on very bad but potent acid. Sometimes bad trips are important though, you tend to learn more from them and they stick with you longer. The film is like a train wreck, choreographed for maximum shock value and none of it comes across as ""faked"" or phony, even the very unconvincing parts of the documentary movie within a movie. In spite of the lousy acting and atrocious overlapping (sic) mis-en-scene approach to staging the documentary footage it still rings true. No wonder people were stupid enough to think this might be a snuff movie -- It hammers away at your brain, senses, taste and stomach until all you can do is react.The violence against animals and women alike shown in the film will & should disgust some viewers. It's always strange to me that people make a clamor for uncensored versions with all of the rape and gore scenes, but then blanch over at the sight of a giant turtle being split open like an egg. I think Deodato suckerpunched everyone with the animal scenes, tantalizing vicarious sexual psychopaths with murmurings of savage carnal rape and then shoving their faces into a barf bucket filled with turtle guts. That was his way of giving rape freaks the finger for getting off on his movie. It should ALL be sickening, get it? The narrative is so powerful and compelling and believable to anyone who used to be an overachieving graduate student type willing to go the lengths to take a shot at the history books even if it costs you your life. I really was impressed by how the film crew fell to pieces as their legacy of horror caught up with them: I can remember hanging painting shows that led to just as much hysteria, vomiting, and scumbags feeding off the slow agonizing metaphoric deaths of others they should be working with, then perishing themselves as the nature of the beast paid them back. Good riddance, another one gone that no one much misses.One area of credit that Deodato deserves some actual genuine cinematic praise for is how he depicts the native tribes people that figure into the mêlée of the story. Not only do they appear to be accurately costumed but their behavior -- not as noble savages, but as people who just happen to have a totally different culture -- is perhaps the most thoughtful out of all the Italian cannibal thrillers. He is never condescending to the natives even when the team of filmmakers is aping Vietnam era soldiers burning down native huts for kicks. Part of me wonders if this isn't some ultimate example of an anti-capitalist Liberal fantasy run amok: white people invade the sanctum of nature, rape and murder their way across the jungle and are torn to pieces & eaten for their arrogance. If Deodato was responding to Vietnam or Cambodia in part, it will be interesting to see how he responds to Iraq, Afghanistan, New York, Madrid, Washington, London, Pennsylvania and Bali with his CANNIBAL METROPOLITAN ""sequel"" in pre-production as of this date.

Maybe watching it for the first time in 2020 means I've missed the point and the relevance. I ended up skipping through it through sheer boredom but what I did watch was pure shock gore and nothing special.,Cannibal Holocaust
59,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"Brutal, gross, unpleasant, but unfortunately relevant",8,11 April 2006,"A documentary film maker from New York City sets out to the jungles of South America to find a missing documentary film crew. Amidst the heat, jungle perils, and violent conflict there he eventually manages to find the crews bodies and their film canisters. He brings the footage back to New York along with its disturbing revelations.Heavily censored, widely banned, and extensively bootlegged this is probably one of the contenders for the single most notorious film. Watching it is no easy task and even more so when you read up on some of the things that went on during production - real animals were killed for example. However, blood, guts, and gore set aside this is a surreal and nightmarish journey into bowels of human treachery.Complemented by a soft and touching score the film is packed with the very contrasts and absurdities that it tries to point out. Also the film, while well before the Reality TV craze, is a shocking commentary on just that. How real can you get? How much more are you going to have to add to please your increasingly callous audience? As the film points out - too much. One of the many disturbing and poignant sequences is the slaughter of a turtle for dinner - the soft touching score plays as the characters happily butcher a hapless animal.The film's main absurdity is that the film makers themselves are in a sense guilty of the crimes that they so harshly criticize - violence, as real as possible, to get an audience. Now the film is not fully exploitative in that it uses the violence, both real and fake, to make its point, but the idea of ""real"" hits very close to home here. You are, in fact, watching what you are not supposed to in a couple scenes. However, you know what they say: fight fire with fire. The same can go for criticism, but the line between it and pure treachery can become controversially thin. So controversial in fact that the director and producer of this film were arrested during its first release, which resulted in the banning of the film in over 60 countries.Due to the film's constraints and production difficulties there are a few scenes that seem to be missing something, most notably a monologue after the killing of a pig, but if you have the stomach for it, this is one of the most brutally compelling films you'll ever see. Also, to keep in mind, this is not a film to be enjoyed, but taken in. 8/10The Grindhouse DVD released in 2005 is unrated (also uncensored) and has disturbing violence, graphic gore, and rape.

These tribes are cannibals and as such hunt, kill and eat fellow humans.The documentary group of 3 are gradually horrifically killed leaving behind only their rotting skeletons and 16mm film footage.
A University professor from New York City recovers the footage and slowly plays it back to the apparent 'delight' of the University who plan to broadcast the footage.It is only on seeing the full gruesome nature of the footage that they change their minds.

61,Superunknovvn,Not the campfest I expected,8,22 July 2004,"""Cannibal Holocaust"" is not the campy little horror flick I expected. It's a ""serious"" and well-made movie and it's an experience you'll hardly ever forget. According to IMDb's trivia section the movie can ""only be seen completely uncut in the EC-UltraBit DVD"", which means that I've seen a tamed down version and that, my friends, is insane! ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is easily one of the most graphic movies I've ever come across. The violence is incredibly realistic. It's no wonder that director Ruggero Deodato was taken to court to prove that he hasn't slain real people for his motion picture. (I still think the real animal slaughtering in the movie was unnecessary. Screw you for that, Deodato!) It's hard to tell if there really is a message or if the ""moral"" is just an excuse for all the gore. In a strange way the violent scenes somehow speak for themselves and do deliver some kind of message, but that's open for discussion.If ever a movie deserved the label ""disturbing"", it's ""Cannibal Holocaust"". It's controversial, but totally worth watching, if you can take some seriously sick images.",Cannibal Holocaust
62,Geeky Randy,"One word, ""Classic!""",10,26 June 2001,"If you decided to read my review, you are probably already interested enough to know what this film is about.The plot is truly original.  Actually, everything about this movie is great. But, one thing completely stands out in the movieThe score.  The score was composed by Riz Ortolani.  Everything about the soundtrack is beautiful.  It goes from being very haunting, to emotional and sad, or simply just beautiful.  Fits in with the movie all the way.  The Main Theme is one of the best songs ever (probably would've been a hit if Cannibal Holocaust wasn't so feared).I saw this movie about two months ago and decided to write a review about it now because I was speechless back when I just viewed it; and I still don't have much to say.  Simply, it's a great movie.  If you have the chance to get your paws on this movie, grab it.  Watch With Caution: This Film Is Very Violent, But Is Something Anybody Will Be Able To Sit Through.One question I have is, what happened to all the actors.  They only played in a couple of films besides this.  They were terrific.  Also, does anybody have guitar tabs the ""Cannibal Holocaust (Main Theme)""?  Once again, I love that song.

The story has a great setup a la Blair Witch Project (footage found of dead crew), but especially in the second half of it the movie becomes nearly unwatchable. Scenes including animals killed, women raped and people getting their heads smashed in, or sliced of... not for everybody's stomach, that's for sure. In the end I was left a bit disappointed, the movie only seemed to wanna shock people and completely leaves any storyline behind... and the animal killings really were too cruel (and I'm not too much of an animal lover neither). 3/10.",Cannibal Holocaust
64,TalesfromTheCryptfan,An Italian horror classic.,9,24 April 2006,"An elite U.S. and Columbian military team go into the jungles of South America to search for lost filmmakers who are making a documentary, they battle cannibal tribes including making friends with one so they can get the filmmaker's lost films but find the filmmaker's dead. In New York City, television producers want to view the reels so they can see if it's suitable enough for television as a documentary special! as they view we also see the filmmaker's adventure into the South American jungles as they find what horrors lie beyond the green inferno.Sadistic, extremely violent, realistic, immoral and disturbing as well Italian made horror adventure classic from Ruggero Deoato that has became a landmark in foreign horror and one of the most infamous movies of all time. The movie is 2 parts in one being the first half being a ""Predator""-style action adventure and the second half the viewer sees through the eyes of the filmmakers within the movie reels documentary-style, yes the acting is awkward but the movie is very original with a haunting music score and has been known as the source for ""The Blair Witch Project"" with the same concept of movie-making with a home camera to make it as a fake documentary and similar plot about people looking for something legendary then a year later their footage is found.The movie is filled with realistic graphic violence, unpleasant rape scenes ( the one in the beginning makes the one in ""Clockwork Orange"" look tame), cannibalism, nudity, gore, smarmy sex scenes, and the most talked about thing in this movie is the horrifying scenes of actual animals getting killed on screen such as a large turtle getting hacked and ripped apart even from it's shell. But the animals in the movie were killed for food supply, when the movie originally came out in Italy it caused quiet a controversy as people thought the filmmakers in the movie were actually murdered as they were arrested but Ruggero Deoato proved in court that no one was actually killed as it was all faked in the movie except for the animals, since then the movie was banned for 4 years then in 1984 it was re-issued again then became a hit worldwide including being one of Japan's highest grossing box-office hits.This film is truly powerful stuff as it's difficult to watch but a very unique movie that assaults the viewers senses! if you thought ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Blue Velvet"", and ""Passion of the Christ"" were pretty button pushing then you ain't seen nothing yet as this movie ranks as a nasty treat besides ""Caligula"" and ""Men Behind The Sun"", it's an important movie in the genre.",Cannibal Holocaust
65,LoneWolfAndCub,Cannibal Holocaust: Exploitation at its best,8,1 October 2007,"Cannibal Holocaust is quite possibly the most hated and controversial films ever made. Banned in over 50 countries and accused of being a snuff film, Cannibal Holocaust was in hot water with governments and censors for awhile. Many hate it and some love it but there is no one in between. I happen to fall into the love it category for many reasons.The movie begins with a TV program about four documentary makers who go missing - Alan Yates, director; Faye Daniels, script girl and Alan's fiancé; and Mark Tomasso and Jack Anders, both cameramen. NYU anthropology professor Harold Monroe heads to the Amazon to lead the search team. They witness disturbing and shocking rituals by all three local tribes. After gaining some trust with the Yanomanos, Monroe discovers that the documentary makers had been killed. Frustrated with the Yanomanos' hostility and brutality, Monroe trades the group's footage (possessed by the Yanomanos) for a tape recorder. Back in New York, he views the material and discovers who the real savages are. As the film starts out, we feel sorry for these four who, for the sake of information, go into the jungle for research only to be savagely mutilated by brutal primitives. However, we come to realize that the natives were the victims of civilized society by being tortured and exploited in incredibly disgusting and inhumane ways by the group (mainly the three males), which ultimately lead to their demises in the most brutal climax ever filmed.Cannibal Holocaust pulls no punches, there is no escape from the atrocities that occur. This movie holds to date some of the sickest acts of sexual violence, violence and animal deaths. Six in total, all on screen and all very graphic. This being the main reason for its controversy and hate.Aside from all the violence and gore there is some great acting, an amazing score, beautiful cinematography and a story with a powerful (albeit not subtle) message.Unlike most Italian cannibal movies, the acting in this isn't corny or clichéd, it's quite good. The intelligent script really helps the actors as well. Riz Ortolani's serene yet disturbing score is played throughout the movie and it really increases the impact of some scenes. The shots of the jungle are beautiful, the perfect mask for the horrors that occur inside. The second half of the movie has some amazing scenes, in fact, some of the best cinematography. The story plays out rather simply but packs a very powerful and meaningful message. The last line, ""Who were the real cannibals?"" summaries it nicely.Kudos should go to Ruggero Deodato for his daring direction, he is brave enough to keep the camera rolling on some of the most horrific acts of murder and rape. Something which today's directors seem to lack, bravery to be daring.As I said before, this is one of my favourite horror movies. It is disturbing and immensely powerful and it pulls no punches. It shall be interesting to see the remake in 2009 as I personally don't see how this can be remade.4/5",Cannibal Holocaust
66,Jithindurden,Perplexing,7,13 June 2018,"It works to an extent in showing who are the real savages but then it doesn't work when it becomes what exactly it is criticizing. But then the director has contradicted himself at different occasions about meaning to include a message and not. However, the level of animal cruelty and racism is quite apparent. The film is quite brilliant and shocking at times but in the end, it's disgusting not just because of what is shown but how they chose to show it.",Cannibal Holocaust
67,asda-man,Abhorrent,1,20 January 2015,"I first became a fan of the horror genre when I was around 14 years old and so I became fascinated to discover all the classics of the genre. I started viewing films such as Halloween and The Exorcist and became obsessed with all the old classics. I then started moving my way in on more violent and disturbing stuff (for me, at the time) such as the Saw series and eventually seeing and loving hardcore horror from other countries, particularly France with Inside and Martyrs. However, one film was popped up on disturbing movie lists and that was Cannibal Holocaust. Reading how horrifying it was, I decided to wait until I was over 18. I finally summed up the courage to watch it yesterday (I've just turned 20) and was pretty bloody appalled.Cannibal Holocaust is an uneasy mix of campy 70's naffness and utterly repugnant violence. I fail to see why it is considered a classic of the genre, let alone a masterpiece of film. Reviewers lead you under the impression that the entire film is done in a found footage manner, when actually it's only the final forty minutes which dips in and out of lost footage being watched by other characters. The first fifty minutes is the more tedious, although less repulsive half, which follows a team going into investigate what happened to a bunch of naïve students who went onto an island overrun by cannibals.It's difficult to believe that Cannibal Holocaust was released in 1980 because it comes across as so dated. As with most Italian horror movies at the time the acting is absolutely atrocious. It doesn't help that the dubbing doesn't quite match with their mouths and every line is delivered in a wooden manner. I read somewhere that one of the actors was actually a porn star, so that gives you an idea of the calibre of acting you can expect.The direction is almost as bad. At times it came across as a parody, especially when the natives started blowing poison darts at the group. It comes across as extremely rough and amateurish, which I suppose prepares us for the final third where we're shown footage from actual amateurs. The music was also pretty awful with an ill-fitting romantic main theme and another piece of strange electronic music which sounds like someone pressing random keys on a cheap keyboard.What absolutely turns my stomach is the actual real footage of animals being killed. Cannibal Holocaust is obviously renowned for this, however I still wasn't prepared. It is completely vile and totally unnecessary. The image of two men pulling a giant sea turtle out of the water and slicing its head off whilst its legs are still kicking will never leave me. The image of a man cutting its shell off with its organs and tissue spilling out will also never leave me. The descriptions you read of the scenes will never prepare you for the actual graphic content which is shown on screen.The worst thing about it is that the film has absolutely zero artistic merit. The only reason why animals are killed on screen is to shock. It has nothing to do with the story, which is barely there. I would recommend that you think really carefully before watching the film because I've never actually felt so upset or sick whilst watching a film.This film is obviously the work of a sadist and I find the film's message of sensationalism in the media and the psychotic nature of human beings absolutely laughable. The entire film is the perfect example of hypocrisy at its worst. How dare a sadistic director lecture us about human nature! A man who is quite happy to torture and kill animals for shock value should not be making a film about how civilised people can be more barbaric than cannibals. Apparently the director was also vile towards all the native extras and was particularly nasty towards the ones who couldn't speak Italian or English.I rarely get angry about films but this one makes my blood boil. I can't stand films which are only there to shock people and Cannibal Holocaust is just a string of shocking scenes. Some of them look laughable (the rape scenes) however, some of them are just repugnant (the forced abortion scene) and totally cross the line (real animal torture). I didn't even realise I had limits until I watched Cannibal Holocaust, and that is not a recommendation. The sheer level of hypocrisy in the films heavy-handed themes is beyond laughable and it is just not made well in the slightest. People who hail this film as a masterpiece are either delusional or sadistic. Maybe both.Read more weird and dazzling reviews at www.asdaman.wordpress.com",Cannibal Holocaust

The Blair Witch people obviously learned something from this.Couldn't take my eyes off it. Despite all the brutality, I couldn't turn away. This flick took shots at the reality TV types 25 years before they existed. Americans & Canadians can also figure this is similar to what was done to the Indians.

Not a great cast, but the acting was good.  The storyline was seldom boring and always interesting.  Came close, but never really got all too close to grossing me out/inducing vomit, at least in my desensitized opinion.  For a truly nasty cannibal experience, try TRAP THEM AND KILL THEM.  This is more of THE EMERALD FOREST-type flick which tries more to make a point about humanity and society.  The animal cruelty was there merely to increase the impact of the serious subject matter.  Excellent, well-rounded foreign film that should not be overlooked. I can't even fathom why anyone would rather see something like ""BABE IN THE CITY"" when there are plenty of masterpieces out there like this.  Yeah right, this ain't for kids;  I first saw this when I was 16, and it didn't screw me up any!

Repetitive shots of cannibals not in the acts of killing or dining get boring, but there's footage of animals actually being killed on camera you don't see everyday, except in the jungle.
Not much sex and nudity, everyone's too busy killing and eating,, but there is some skin on display, besides all the near naked natives running around-what would exploitation be without it?

71,Ali_John_Catterall,Jungle Jollies,5,19 November 2009,"The most scandalous of the Italian 'cannibal' movies subgenre isn't the most disgusting (that would probably be Cannibal Ferox, aka Make Them Die Slowly), but it has picked up the most press over the years, following the tremendous controversy over its initial release. One of the original 'Video Nasties', the film features graphic depictions of (staged) snuff, real-life executions (courtesy of newsreel footage from war-torn Africa) and - most upsettingly - Mondo-style images of real-life animal killing, including the dismemberment of a live sea turtle by an Amazonian tribe.However, one of the biggest reasons why this one made such a stir is for a neat trick that the makers of the The Blair Witch Project re-employed two decades later: Cannibal Holocaust is a film within a film, staged as a documentary. With the original actors in pre-arranged hiding after release, director Ruggero Deodato was even arrested and accused of having murdered his cast for real, before convincing the authorities otherwise.This is one film that's had its long-pig cake and eaten it, being widely interpreted as a comment on developing world exploitation by the media. Bafflingly, its theme tune also resembles a cross between Queen's 'Too Much Love Will Kill You' and something composed by the Simon May Orchestra for a 1980s UK soap.",Cannibal Holocaust
72,baileycrawly,"Ahead of Its Time (And a Product of It, Too)",7,3 July 2020,"There are many things that are preferable to watching this film again, for it's not a pleasant film to watch. It's very beautifully shot and, with a main theme that exists to provide direct juxtaposition to the images that transpire on-screen, it's deceptively appealing at first glance. In fact, for the uninitiated, it's particularly easy to be deceived into thinking they've come across the wrong film, or that the shocking ride is nothing more than hype. But how wrong they would be.Cannibal Holocaust is one of the classic found footage films about a documentary film crew that attempt to record a cannibal tribe's activities and wind up falling victim to the cannibals. The film heavily features a crew of individuals who have been sent in to try it find the filmmakers and the horrors they encounter, showing the found-footage film with varying degrees of censorship depending on your region. It's a plot that's been done a hundred times over, but this was one of the earlier ones. It's one of a number of Italian cannibal films to come out in the eighties, and has gone on to be Ruggero Deodato's most well-known film despite the previous film in his cannibal trilogy, Jungle Holocaust, being both better in quality and easier for viewers sensitive to the issues of Cannibal Holocaust.This film ultimately asks the question of who is the true cannibalistic monster as you see a number of horrible activities transpiring by the crew looking for the filmmakers. It's at this point that the film cannot be taken lightly: there is real animal cruelty depicted relentlessly on the screen, scenes of bloody rape (which, we must assume, are fake) and anything in between that Deodato could find to tell his story whilst making it appear to be a snuff film.Despite its faults, it was ahead of its time by offering a legitimate message - something to think about - behind the horror. After all, there's a reason why this film continues to endear and stand out in a genre that's got more films than we could possibly count. It's a product of its time, with the horrible depiction of treatment toward women and animals, but it's also ahead of its time for making the audience truly think. It's an ugly film and something no sane person would want to regularly return to for repeat viewing, but it's an important film that has earned its place in history and should be seen by everyone at least one time in their lives.",Cannibal Holocaust
73,blackmamba99971,To the extreme,5,27 April 2017,"At the time most Hollywood movies allowed animals to die in a film. From horses, to dogs, which were strays plus the few nocturnal bats. Cannibal holocaust was also the first movie to introduce Found footage sequences to make it seem more real than it actually is. A story about a group of anthropologist thrill seekers who wanted to make a documentary about a hidden tribe not seen by any white man in history. Tales of past cannibalistic people started to surface in the mid to late seventies as borders in the amazon forest became public after much heated debates in the U.N.Soon countless documentaries were told about reclusive, and often remote tribal people on camera. Some that became violent resulted in either internal executions or from an outside source such as the military regimes who thwarted the indigenous people as punishment. Yet to give this film a broader scope the realistic viewpoints of the troupe landed them in deep trouble as their idealistic way through uses of unneeded violence such as gang raping one of the women or killing animals as a means to eat. The effects bordered both realism, and daunting horror as each trekker became victim to their own debauchery, and unconfined judgment to get that one perfect shot even in the face of death.After this film was shown in theatres most went to the humane society, and vetoed Cannibal Holocaust from the public eye because it was so honestly raw, and horrific to stomach. Censors from all over the US banned it from being shown because of the extremities, and wanton chaos that the story had displayed. In fact it was vaulted until an appeal was issued some twenty years later VIA the freedom of speech act was brought up in the shortest court case in history. Since then this film had been the pinnacle of later films such as the Blair Witch Project and countless other movies that uses found footage techniques.Except with this film, not all could still stomach some of the gratuitous gore, or unneeded sequences of killing animals such as the turtle, or boar, and even the Muskrat. The cruelty displayed in Cannibal Holocaust still lingers to those viewers who saw it the first time, and has never adapted well to other such films. Perhaps the desensitization dug deeper than it would allow but for newer audience members it has a cult following. For me I do not like this film. It uses too much grotesque misogynistic scenes that displays at how thoughtless, and ridiculous a human can be.Although it was supposed to be an anthropology study, it soon became a mindless crazed romp in the jungle with a group of students who only wanted to be famous no matter the cost. Yet in the end their only means of remembrance got burned in the cellar incinerator along with all of their notes, and collected archived footage. An ironic result that stated to the outside world that the amazon forest should remain a mystery, and for those who trespass onto sacred ground knowing or not knowing the rules could get them killed. Either way the people have been ongoing since the stone age, and does not need to be disturbed by any interference's. Not recommended to anyone under the age of eighteen.

So I bought it, brought it home, put it on the shelf, and waited. For 3 weeks it sat there, intriguing me and making me want to watch it. But I wanted to wait until the perfect time. So one night I had some friends over, and us and my brother popped it in to watch. Didn't take too long to realize what we had gotten ourselves into. This truly WAS the most gory, disturbing, and gross movie EVER MADE!!! And I NEVER exaggerate, I am being 110% serious when I say it is the most gruesome movie ever! It will most likely make you sick! It made my brother and his friend leave the room, and me and my one friend stayed and watched until the end. GOOD LORD! However, despite the gore, the gut-wrenching slaughter, the low-grade acting, and the low-budget...this truly was a GREAT movie! Robert Kerman (Porn Star) was VERY well cast as Professor Harold Monroe. Alan Yates is truly the most evil (realistic) movie character I've seen. The story was terrific. The tribe people were very good as well, all of them. The deaths looked REAL! According to reviews, Ruggero Deodato was arrested after this was released and had to have all the actors show up in court to prove it wasn't a snuff film. Carl Gabriel Yorke (Alan Yates) says he was scared he was going to be killed on screen. He also is haunted by the movie and regrets being in it.

You will consistently see scenes where a real live jungle critter is slain and chopped up for eating, sometimes while still twitching and trying to escape. I found these scenes far more disturbing than the simulated human cannibalism scenes.This is a fantastic achievement of horror given what they created it from- very little. If you want to test your gross-out ability this movie will put you to the test! This movie is a 70s movie and follows that classic laid back pace and displays a culture where looking dorky was still cool.The movie style itself is quasi-Blair Witch and may have served as an inspiration for that later flick.

He finds the crew's skeletons. Encountering the cannibals, he recovers the rolls of film that the crew shot. Back in New York, Monroe is shocked to see the footage consists of the filmmakers killing & raping the natives. But, as the footage shows, the cannibals get their revenge ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is the most notorious of the Italian cannibal films of the late 70's / early 80's. Banned in just about every country in the world, including Italy, the film was seized & the director had to go to court to prove that what happens on screen was faked. Which brings me to the film's most disturbing aspect. The gore may be extreme, with legs amputated by machete, a rape where the victim is bashed to death with a stone dildo, a pregnant native woman being tied up & her unborn child aborted & so on, but what is truly terrible about the film are the scenes of animal mutilation. A muskrat gets sliced up, a monkey has it's head chopped off, a pig shot in the head & a giant turtle is torn to pieces. As an animal lover, I find these scenes to be reckless & distasteful, not to mention offensive. Sure the human gore is not bad, but the animals' gruesome deaths is too much to bear. At the end of the day, the film shocks & disturbs, just what a good horror flick should do, but goes too far with the animal cruelty.",Cannibal Holocaust
79,squeezebox,"Better than NATURAL BORN KILLERS, could do without the animal slaughter",6,30 July 2005,"Political correctness is not something I usually expect to see in an Italian cannibal gut-muncher flick, and there's none to be found in CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. But the filmmakers would like you to think there's some in there, and that, in a way, actually hinders what could have been a really powerful movie.Not that CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST isn't outrageously violent and extremely disturbing at times, but like so many other ""serious"" exploitation movies (e.g. SALO, MEN BEHIND THE SUN), the filmmakers go so far over the top depicting the spilling of blood and guts that whatever points they purport to want to make are drowned in their own gruesome sensationalism.This is especially counter-productive in CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST because it is the very thing that director Ruggero Deodatto claims to be satirizing. The movie lacks the sophistication of George Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD or Stanley Kubrick's CLOCKWORK ORANGE, two similar movies which tackle their social commentary with wit and style.It's similar to (and better than) Oliver Stone's NATURAL BORN KILLERS, in that it claims to be a satire of the media's passion for presenting violence and depravity to audiences who eat it up, while it's really just an exploitation of it. Deodatto, like Stone, smacks you over the head with a bludgeon, making his points so obviously and self-righteously that they go right out the window, and the movie winds up being little more than a freakshow of eye-popping special effects and nauseating live animal slaughter.The animal slaughter in CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST is especially offensive, more so than any other of this odd subgenre, because most of it is perpetrated by the explorers and not the (supposedly real) native cannibal tribe. In CANNIBAL FEROX and JUNGLE HOLOCAUST, one can make an attempt to condone the violence against animals only because it appears to be committed by jungle dwelling people as part of their natural routine. One cannot make the same excuse for CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST.But if you're looking for outlandish sleaze and carnage, look no further than CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST. It's definitely a must-see for any self-respecting cannibal movie fan. Everyone else should steer way, way clear.It was obviously an inspiration for both THE LAST BROADCAST and THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.",Cannibal Holocaust
80,coldwaterpdh,See it once.,9,13 April 2008,"""Cannibal Holocaust"" has a low rating on here for one reason and one reason only: people can't take it. It is the one film that I've seen in my life that crosses so many lines, you get nervous about fifteen minutes into it. You start to think 'what am I getting myself into here...?' It's exploitation at it's most brutal and realistic. Anything further would be snuff. It's certainly the WORST movie I ever want to see.If you are on that collision course with Italian horror, you are bound to come across this flick sooner or later. If you're like me, you'll question yourself before watching it. It contains some animal cruelty, which, while being horrific and hard to watch, leaves a lasting impression on you that is one of love for animals and not hatred. You end up hating the people who are doing it, not enjoying the scenes. I'd like to remind everyone that ""Apocalypse Now"" also contains a bit of this, but people herald that film as a masterpiece. (see AFI's TOP 100 Films...) Along with the notorious animal stuff, this film contains very realistic gore and special effects, especially given the age and budget of ""Cannibal Holocaust."" It also contains scenes of such graphic cruelty that you will no doubt be shocked by what you are seeing, regardless of movies you've seen before.Most importantly, this film delivers a twist that while not totally surprising, remains very effective. It does have a message and it's a pretty strong one at that. What makes someone a 'savage?' Watch this film and find out. If you dare.Effective, bold, imaginative and 100% nihilistic, ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is a movie you will NEVER forget.9 out of 10, kids.",Cannibal Holocaust
81,evening1,Builds to almost unbearable suspense,9,1 July 2019,"Four cocky Americans go into the rain forest to document a cannibalistic tribe. Other crews have tried and not come back, but this group mocks such losers. When it turns out the quartet isn't heard from for two months, a New York-based anthropologist sets out to find out what happened. When he returns with the doc crew's rough cut, he learns their fate and resolves to burn the film.This last fact is one of the weaker elements of this exceedingly hard to watch but profound film. Professor Harold Monroe (Robert Kerman) is the anthropologist who presumably strives to understand the human animal. He discovers some horrible truths in his probe -- so why on earth would he want to destroy the evidence?Sure, there is a lot in the sensationally titled ""Cannibal Holocaust"" that is hard to witness. However, the movie is exceedingly well-done and has important things to say. I discovered it while doing a little Internet reading on found-footage films, during which I learned that ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is the granddaddy of a genre that includes such other fine works as ""The Blair Witch Project.""The movie takes us to a border zone spanning Brazil and Peru, a no-man's land in which tribes armed with spears, blow darts, and a taste for human flesh have occasional encounters with the white man and his superior fire power. The Westerners' shortcoming is a far inferior knowledge of the jungle.When Monroe treks into the rain forest, he has a supremely experienced and no-nonsense guide, who, critically, understands and knows how to treat the native peoples effectively. As a result, this guide and his entourage manage to survive the expedition.In contrast, the documentary crew loses its guide to a snake bite early on, and does not know enough to turn back and quit while they're ahead. Rather, they are spurred on by dreams of winning an Oscar and getting rich. They show themselves to be utterly amoral as they taunt and abuse the native peoples, with absolutely no compunction for what they have wrought. Karma follows shortly behind.Yes, there is violence against animals in this film, but all of it serves a purpose. A muskrat is slit open, but its organs feed a native youth captured and managed most effectively by Monroe's posse. The documentarians capture a large river turtle and we must watch as it is taken apart while alive, but the animal serves as food.Some extremely sorry truths about human nature arise from this film. Along the way it dawns on the viewer that the film crew's arrogance, cruelty, and mayhem are likely part of our very own history. After all, native peoples once ruled our homeland, and it doesn't take much of a leap of imagination to guess that many of this movie's abuses likely tainted our own home turf.Important questions arise as to who is civilized and who is primitive. The natives in this film were not looking for trouble. They wanted to be left alone to live their lives in peace (which is not to say that they did not exact horrible penalties for criminal behavior and did not battle their own native adversaries with ruthlessness).There is a lot here to ponder, and I do not think this movie should be shunned because of its excesses. That would be like mimicking the anthropologist, ultimately. I once saw a documentary about Japanese director Akira Kurasawa, who had witnessed the carnage following the atom bombing of Hiroshima. Never look away from the truth, he advised. Good words for us all to remember!",Cannibal Holocaust
82,GeorgeRoots,"""Super Distasteful"", Best Describes ""Cannibal Holocaust"".",5,11 August 2014,"As far as ""Grind-house"" goes, this is one considered the best of what exploitation has to offer. I truly do love ""Grind-house"" Cinema, but the first time I watched this movie I was 16 and this film shocked the absolute crap out of me. It was really one of those curiosity viewings, and before you say ""why the hell were you watching it at that age""? This is kind of tame considering what the Internet has to offer nowadays. It's also funny considering that when I was 21, I went to Thailand for a month on holiday and ended up discussing the movie at length with a 26 year old Scottish girl.The actual killing of animals in the way they did on this film just really bugs me to no end. The endless raping and abuse to the natives ultimately leads to the group getting what they deserve. For as much as the film makes social commentary of sorts throughout this movie, personally it comes off tame and laughable like old schoolyard bullying, and it never really left that much of an impression on me.I can respect that Ruggero Deodato got to make the film he wanted to make, and I can also respect the ""cult following"" it has gained over the years. I'm glad it exists and is heralded as much as it is condemned. But unfortunately it remains nothing more than a curiosity of the past, and the morals (If any) of the story haven't aged well. It's straight up shock value, and the imagery is pushed way beyond the term ""reconstructed"". I've realised in writing all this I've probably also promoted this movie in some strange way.Final Verdict: I'm glad I finally watched it and saw what the fuss was all about. But I hope to never watch it again anytime soon, just for the fact that it really isn't all that great. 5/10.",Cannibal Holocaust

In New York City, a TV news reporter tells the details surrounding their disappearance. They are Alan Yates (Gabriel Yorke) the director; Faye Daniels (Francesca Ciardi) his girlfriend and script girl; and friends Jack Anders (Perry Pirkanen) and Mark Tomaso (Luca Giorgio Barbareschi) who work as cameramen. They were last seen near the remote Columbian town of Leticia which is deep in the jungle on the border between Brazil and Peru, trying to film a documentary about cannibal tribes in the rain forest. The film is very disturbing and very gory at time for some people to watch as this was one of the Video Nasties that was banned in Britain for many years and was not available for a long time.

This is a true horror/suspense film and it's done superbly by Ruggero Deodato and Riz Ortalini (Who conducted the powerful music in it.)Oh yeah and before I forget, the Blair Witch Project totally ripped their ideas from this film.(Yeah guys I believe you , when you say the idea was original)The movie is about 4 filmmakers who disappear in the jungle to do a story on journalism.....they never came back. AAAAgggh!!! :-)From the time the movie started till the credits went down I was simply amazed by the production value of it. It's awesome and it's no wonder Ruggero Deodata had to prove in court that the actors weren't killed ,because he makes this film so real.There is some humor in it too, there's foul language and jokes all over the place-though some of it is in Spanish/Italian,but myself being Latino, and knowing Spanish , I enjoyed the jokes throughly.I am happy to say I never fast forward in this film, having seen so many horror films , I am used to this kinda thing.Next to Lucio Fulci, Ruggero Deodata is a god in Italian cinema.Search for it, because it's still banned in several countries.But it's a must see!!! It will be worth it. Especially for you horror fans.",Cannibal Holocaust
87,Tromafreak,Jungle Gore: Justice Served,8,8 June 2009,"The Italian Cannibal sub-genre is obviously an acquired taste. Founded by Umberto Lenzi, and eventually resurrected by Bruno Mattei, but only a man named Ruggero Deodato would have the nerve to create a cannibal epic that would not only over-shadow the ones before it, but blow every single one after it out of the water. Cannibal Holocaust is not only king of its respective B-movie sub-genre, but also, the ultimate in disturbing exploitation. If there is such a thing as a cannibal masterpiece, here it is. About a Professor who's investigating the disappearance of an American film team who had wondered off into the depths of the Amazon jungle, hoping to film a documentary based on the rumors of a primitive tribe who may or may not have practiced cannibalism. A sadistic bunch, none of whom seem to have much respect for life, only money and success, and a passionate desire to keep on shooting, no matter what. Once these morally corrupt sadists reach their desired destination, they decide to have a little fun with the locals, and madness ensues. Rapings, burnings, castrations, and impailings will set the tone for the rest of this movie that most refer to as ""a shot-gun blast to the senses"". As a horror movie, Cannibal Holocaust is about as terrifying as it gets. plunged into such a massive wilderness that you know very little about, filled with tons of living things that want to kill you, the ones most capable now have a very good reason, and happen to know this place very, very well, kinda scary. As shock cinema goes, it's quite simply the ultimate, not even Beyond The Darkness can stand toe-to-toe with this beast. Some compare it to The Blair Witch Project, which always makes me chuckle. Even as a fan of this stuff, I find it peculiar beyond words that there has ever been a fan base for something so blindingly vile. As rough as things always end up in these atrocities, they always turn out to be damn good movies. Plenty of adventure and suspense, never really a dull moment to speak of. More than plenty beautiful exotic scenery at all times Not a lot to dislike, other than the gruesome mutilations, and if you're already amused by such a thing, then I guess you've found yourself one hell of an entertaining movie. Anyone out there who might dig stuff shot on video, don't miss Bruno Mattei's 2003 sequel/prequel/remake/rip-off, Cannibal Holocaust: The Beginning. For something worthwhile, on the other hand, check out Deodato's Jungle Holocaust. As for this one, there could have always been more actual gore, so, perhaps Cannibal Holocaust only deserves 9 stars, although, those authentic animal killings tell me otherwise. 8/10",Cannibal Holocaust
88,Jacques98,Fun for the whole desensitized family.,6,7 April 2009,"When I think of horror, truly genuine horror, not the cheap stuff that teenage girls scream-giggle-giggle at, it's almost always something hyper-realistic. Do not misunderstand me. I'm not contradicting H.P. Lovecraft when he stated that ""horror and fantasy are only separated by a stream of black water"", but I am saying it's a narrow-minded view. Fantasy worlds that we do not understand will always scare some of us, but there will also always be a group of people who find all unrealistic horror completely laughable. In the exact opposite sense, I've never once heard a person say that the premises behind truly realistic horror films were laughable. Ironically, realistic horror is scarce. Perhaps it's because we live in a time where modern directors saw The Omen when they were 2-years-old, their underdeveloped minds mistook cheese for terror, and now they live and breathe to pump the horror genre full of crappy, unoriginal movies like The Unborn or A Tale of Two Sisters. Thus, whenever I see a truly realistic horror film, regardless of its quality, I can't help but take it at least twice as seriously as I would yet another ""Oh there's a cheesy demon! Let's get naked then do some insanely stupid thing and get killed!"" film. In other words: Cannibal Holocaust is far from a great film in terms of quality, but the fact it's actually realistic gives it weight, and makes it worth watching.The first time I attempted to watch Cannibal Holocaust, I'll admit I was bored to the point of tears. It just seemed like a toned-down, less entertaining version of The Temple of Doom. I turned it off 15 minutes in. The next day came, and I reluctantly decided to force myself to sit through the other 70 minutes of the film. This time, it caught my attention immediately. The boring faux-documentary set-up blended into an infinitely more interesting study of human nature.While most films that ""study"" human nature really just end up repeating elementary facts that we knew before we were old enough to get into PG-rated movies, there is quite a bit more intelligence here. Instead of typically displaying the entire modern society (or just the American society) as evil, Cannibal Holocaust accurately depicts the mental breakdown of the young live-for-the-moment mind. In 2009, that's something I've rarely seen. In 1980, I'm pretty sure it was an original concept to display on film. Also, what makes Cannibal Holocaust infinitely more realistic to Battle Royale or Lord of the Flies is that it NEVER uses extremes. While the former two works that I listed lump the entire human race together into a single idealistic gobbledygook character type, Cannibal Holocaust does the opposite and presents good, bad, AND everything in between through diverse, realistic character traits. This is why Cannibal Holocaust is so intelligent in presenting the whole cliché ""human nature is to kill"" concept.As for the quality . . . Well, people have accurately said that the acting (from the older people) isn't great. The four (young) central characters all act realistically, and are portrayed realistically. However, I didn't find the acting bad enough to be distracting at any point in the film. Some of the gore effects are outdated, but, again, I didn't feel it took away from the story unless you allow it to.The gore is minimal at best. Some would go as far as to say it isn't there at all. There are a few generic, non-graphic Hollywood rape scenes, a few infamous animal killings, and a few human lacerations, but that's about it. It's nothing you haven't seen hundreds of times before. A lot like A Clockwork Orange and Natural Born Killers, I have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA how this film was labeled as insanely violent, much less violent/gory at all. The small amount of gore that was there was simply generic, and done in a non-graphic way. I'm someone who is very sensitive to graphic gore, and I found everything in this movie below the level of violence in the average R-rated movie. Compared to any given Saw film, Cannibal Holocaust just looks bloodless. I am not complaining about this, however. Just stating the fact. The movie did not need more gore for any reason, and I blame the lack of it only on the silly infamous hype.Overall, I found Cannibal Holocaust a very entertaining and thought-provoking experience. I watched it with low expectations and had an absolute blast. One of the most fun movies I've ever watched alone. Regardless of my tastes, however, it is impossible to deny the territory and importance of this film on the horror genre. It forces you out of your face fantasy world and rubs your face in the filth of the real world . . . even if that filth isn't really that disturbing.6/10",Cannibal Holocaust

Disguised as a social film, if you see the real intentions of Ruggero Deodato, it was only to make a Cannibal film, but not as a social commentary, if only as a horror film. I can say that this film is not even bad. Of course that its wonderful that movies treat social topics, about different cultures, about media abuse and domination (For that you can see ""Shock Treatment"" or ""Network""), ""Cannibal Holocaust"" seems to bring that message, but really don't.

The makers of this film aren't better than the characters of this film who were presented as ""evil people"". But still I can appreciate the rest of the film, which was great.

This is truly one of the most disturbing, vile films ever made and yet I keep coming back to it. I saw this movie for the first time about 6 or 8 months ago.

95,Johan_Wondering_on_Waves,My first cannibal movie,7,17 July 2015,"have seen it this despite it combines two of my not so favorite elements being gore and found footage. It's pretty weird because found footage stands for me for ""what the X is going on?"" or to quote one of those annoying Blair Witch characters ""What the X is that?"" while no one could see anything and there might have been nothing and probably was nothing. But it's not about The Blair Witch Project. If Cannibal Holocaust did one thing right despite its disturbing content was not to shy away from what was happening and make it clear what actually was filmed not his overly shaky drunk camera-work which makes me dizzy. But the found footage is only in the second half (approximately 40 minutes and interrupted by reactions of shock from those who are in discussion whether to broadcast it or not).Now about the gore well almost exclusively in the found footage stuff and no I didn't really come only from the cannibals. Actually the things the white documentary makers were doing were way more disturbing to me. They actually were the ones acting like savages, uncivilized beasts. I think it answered the professor's question at the end very well there ""Who are actually the cannibals?"" Obviously not the natives.I liked the build-up the professor visiting the native tribes and he sees they are actually not those savages that outsiders believe them to be. But it could have been shortened in my opinion. Maybe some more time could have been given to those nasty documentary shooters. Yeah it's hard to get much character development if only excerpts from their documentary are shown and I doubt however I would have felt more sympathy for them in the end. I knew the film would not want to make me feel sorry for them, they deserved their fate as cruel as it was but what they did to the natives and the animals was much more cruel. They obviously wanted to abuse their power to get sensational shots Yes even if Faye the only female among the 4 adventurers didn't really actively participate in harassing the natives. She did nothing to prevent her colleagues committing these crimes, she did approve of them. The only time she intervenes is when the guys rape a native girl not because she feels pity for the girl but because she doesn't want them to waste film and she particularly doesn't like it when her sleazy boyfriend has a go at the girl too. While it might sound cliché yeah the guys are pigs in it, the girl is again the decent one. Well that stood for me until Faye allowed herself to be banged by her boyfriend for all the natives to see and went totally down the drain when she did nothing to save that poor native girl from the white rapists.Now I have been hesitating to talk about the animal killings and abuse. Again I think the white men where the ones who did it for their pleasure not the natives, with the turtle scene the most obvious example. But to say that the movie needs to rely on these scenes to shock the audience clearly didn't get the point the movie makers wanted to make. Again the cruelties are shown not always overly detailed (which isn't necessary), we know here exactly what cruelties are and who does them, we don't need to guess. Not that feeling I have with other found footage what did happen? Did there happen actually anything? Now, is this a good movie? I think in its genre yes very much. I really like how it panned out and I liked the point the makers tried to get across. It has happened before so many times white men forcing their ""civilization"" onto tribes in Africa, America even wiping out whole tribes of them. Of course they would fight back to keep their land, their culture. That's what every race would do to protect their own kind. I'm not saying I am a fan of found footage now but it actually redeemed my view on the genre at least if it would actually be filmed in the way it was done in Cannibal Holocaust. I guess when they go supernatural as since Blair Witch and so on I would lose my interest again.",Cannibal Holocaust
96,Casey-52,"The most beautiful, emotional, and gut-wrenching horror film ever made",9,19 August 2000,"I have only met one other person that has seen CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, so I get the picture that HOLOCAUST is still a cult film only for those willing to seek it out. It is not readily available for anyone to see, which makes the eventual viewing that much more of a triumph. But to fully triumph and proudly claim that you have experienced CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, you must endure the entire film itself, without once closing your eyes or using the fast-forward button. Then you can truly say that you have seen HOLOCAUST. I am proud to say that I have seen it and I love it dearly.Ruggero Deodato's infamous ""video nasty"" is still banned in the UK and Australia, has never officially been released in the US (though it did meet a few 42nd Street theatres unofficially), and was even banned in its maker's home country of Italy. But after 21 years, CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST still remains the bad boy that it was then and probably will remain forever. I have yet to see anywhere else so many gruesome images, heartbreaking situations, and nauseating violence packed into one film, let alone a mainstream film. The story is simple: a group of four filmmakers disappear in the Amazon jungle and a professor tracks down a series of film cans left behind in a native village. The cans hold the secret behind the disappearance and the ultimate truth regarding humanity at its worse. That is part of what makes HOLOCAUST so hard to watch: the audience is constantly shown that we, the ""civilized"" people, have a primal side to us, a primal side that is (wrongly) demonstrated by the Tree People in the Amazon. The message: we are all capable of reverting back to our primal ways. Yet the racism of the message is quite clear and can be read as follows: natives of the Amazon are primitives, while we are not (but could be).Deodato's direction is almost flawless; the majority of the film is gorgeous jungle cinematography that creates mixed emotions of beauty, tranquility, savagery, voyueurism, brutality, and danger. While I prefer the camerawork in Deodato's JUNGLE HOLOCAUST, here it serves a better purpose given the storyline. Riz Ortolani's soundtrack is simply beautiful. It used to be available on CD, but is now out of print, unfortunately. The acting of the film crew is not too bad and fits in well with the situations and realistic feeling of their situation; porn actor Robert Kerman is good, as usual, and gets fully naked here.One of the problems many people have with this film is the constant animal violence. There are hard-to-watch scenes of a monkey's face being chopped off, a muskrat being stabbed to death, and worst of all, a giant sea turtle dismembered and torn apart while still alive. I do not condone the violence and often fast-forward past it (not in the first viewing, though), but it does aid the overall feeling that the documentary footage is real and is not faked. Adding to this gritty realistic feeling are several tribal rituals, including a woman being raped and beaten to death with a stone dildo for adultery; a gory tribal abortion, ending in a fetus buried alive in mud; and a native who, after losing her virginity in a gangrape by the filmmakers, is impaled on a pole up her anus and out her mouth. Quite strong stuff to watch, but HOLOCAUST is still a wonderful film that easily makes my Top 10 list of Best Horror Films.",Cannibal Holocaust
97,Afracious,The definitive and ultimate cannibal film,8,6 March 2000,"This is a notorious and controversial film, but also a remarkably well made film. The story is about an expedition of four filmmakers, who go missing in the Amazon jungle. A New York anthropologist professor named Monroe is sent there to investigate, and discovers the film footage of the crew. On his return to New York the footage is examined, and the shocking and graphic fate of the crew is revealed. The crew turn out to be as ruthless and uncivilized as the tribe. They burn the tribe's homes, kill their animals and rape one of them. The final scenes are perturbing. The only voice of reason and sane thought throughout the entire film is that of professor Monroe, and he leaves us with a question to ponder at the end. This is a far better film than the Blair Witch Project, which so blatantly plagiarised this. This film deserves to be seen, and it's outrageous that most people are not allowed to watch it.",Cannibal Holocaust
98,David_Frames,Possibily the most unpleasant 90 minutes of your life,1,28 February 2006,"...and I'm including Krakatowa Powers and the Geyserettes (1997) in there. Cannibal Holocaust has always enjoyed that special sort of notoriety that comes from been banned in various ""territories"" but whereas some movies get the cull for reasons of self-censorship or cultural sensitivity (A Clockwork Orange for example), Holocaust is a thick soup of voyeuristic, demented violence and gore - censored despite the fact that the sort of people who'd want to see it more than once are precisely the type of malforms that will get a copy anyway whereas most others would either chose not to watch it or start to and realise that it's a load of old crap. Indeed its got internal organs galore but curiously no brains. Banning it serves no purpose other than to give it an aura it doesn't deserve. It is, when all the hype is cut away, say like the guts of a giant turtle, a supremely soul-destroying, pointless experience. Artistically worthless. The only reason to watch it at all is to see how much worse it's going to get and I'm not spoiling anything for you by saying that your looking at quite a scale and the journey is long and tough. The story or hook if you like, is that, some movie makers go into the jungle, encounter a tribe of base savages who eat their fellow man and get horribly brutalised, murdered and consumed but luckily for us the whole thing is captured on film. This is pre-Blair Witch stuff with a great deal more calories, conceived by Deodato, the would-be snuff peddler when those directors were chest-lunching. To say that 'ol Holocaust is hard going is just ever so understating the case. Many movies claim to be a difficult watch but in this case the real holocaust might have been a preferable experience. Men and women have equal reason to fear its many stomach churning sequences. For the boys it'll be the scene in which some poor sod has his penis excised from his genital space and eaten while the baying mob disembowel him alive. Girls, sit back and look forward to the woman mounted vaginally on a spear scene and lets not forget the animal snuff. Pigs, monkeys, turtles - you name it they get it. If you've always thought that Babe was missing the scene in which he gets the bullet or that Finding Nemo might have worked better with a display of turtle guts then this is the flick you've been waiting your whole life to see. Scalped monkeys are the perfect antidote to all those cutesy born free type movies we've had to suffer over the years but the directors a brave man because if the A.L.F ever see this he'll need to be checking the underside of his car with a mirror for life. There was a lot of nonsense when this was made about it being snuff and those sensitive Italians didn't like the animal slaughter (this is the nation that invented fascism!) but the authorities may have wondered why you'd release a film that portrayed you murdering your cast (its damning evidence after all) - why not just murder them? In the end the only people who really get slayed are the audience but not in a funny way - if its this or 'While you Were Sleeping' it's still the Bullock movie...but only just of course.",Cannibal Holocaust
99,haterofcrap,Awful,1,8 September 2010,"I never saw in my life such a disgusting and boring film like this. There is nothing good about this horrible film. I hated everything about it, everything about it is horrible: -The music score: which is corny and doesn't fit with the disgusting scenes.-The performances: That are even worse than in ""The Blair Witch Project"".-The characters, that are ugly, unlikeable and despicable.-The story: Which is only muddled and pretentious.Everything about this film is sick and wrong. Don't see it, it is easily one of the worst films ever made.",Cannibal Holocaust
100,Rathko,The Godfather of Cannibal Movies,10,11 August 2005,"An excellent film, and by far the best of the 'cannibal' genre. The first half, chronicling Monroe's journey to find the lost film-makers, is typical jungle survivalist stuff; combating the elements and assorted wildlife while snorting a few lines of coke and frolicking naked in the nearest river. It is the second half of the movie, in which we see the documentary footage shot by the missing filmmakers, in which 'Cannibal Holocaust' shines. The shaky hand-held camera, the straight-to-camera delivery, the choppy editing, the varying focus and poor framing all add to a genuine sense of authenticity. The whole thing makes 'Blair Witch', which copied the conceit 20 years later, seem extremely staged and phony by comparison. The visual effects are outstanding, and made all the more effective due to the realism of the film-making technique.Performances, despite others' criticism, are surprisingly sound, and well above the norm for the genre. Only Francesca Ciardi possesses that laughable, and vaguely embarrassing, 'bad acting' quality, but her real purpose is, of course, to wander around naked, which she does very well. The script is linear and makes sense, with none of the usual surreal leaps of logic and cavernous plot holes. The music in cannibal movies is often unusually good, and of a quality far beyond expectations. 'Cannibal Holocaust's score is brilliant, ranging from mellow 70's easy listening to traditional full orchestra suspense to modern abstract soundscapes. While I miss the raucous chords of Donati/Maglione's score for 'Mangiati vivi' and 'Cannibal Ferox', there's no denying that Riz Ortalani is a far more talented composer.As ever, there is the usual 'moral' message, with characters spouting pseudo-liberal nonsense whilst gazing profoundly into the middle distance. This is, of course, as much a part of the genre as ritual gang rape and mud wrestling, but in 'Cannibal Holocaust' it is particularly hypocritical considering the obvious amorality of all involved. While condemning the on screen filmmakers for encouraging acts of cruelty and violence, Deodarto encourages his actors to indulge in similar acts of cruelty and violence towards animals in the name of 'entertainment', without the usual moral justification of observing 'tribal' acts of survival. Whilst such scenes don't really harm the movie, they make a mockery of any 'message' Deodarto may claim to convey, and ask some serious questions about the ethics of both him and his cast.Really a very good movie that were it stripped of it's scenes of animal cruelty would enjoy far more popular success. 'Cannibal Holocaust' isn't just good for the genre, but a good movie in general, and far more original and entertaining that anything seen in cinema's of late.",Cannibal Holocaust
101,tequila101,"A very Sick film that does'nt really make it's point, but on the other hand really, really Excellent",9,14 January 2011,"Cannibal Holocaust would have to be one of the most sickest film I've ever looked at.A couple of days ago my friend and I were really pumped up to see this film and it turned out that he hated it. But i had a different feeling for the way this film turned out. The rape, the torture, the blood, everything was done so well except for one thing that was not needed.... Animal Cruelty. I will get to that in a moment but I'll talk about the things that made this film excellent. I also want to put out that at times it didn't feel like a horror film.Acting, 7.5/10: The acting I could say was up to scratch, It's not the best but what they hey, they did OK.Scenes, 9/10: Most of the scenes as we all know are very rough and at times too hard to handle. I found this film most of the time very hard to handle, especially the rape scenes. Most of the scenes felt very powerful and at times it felt emotional. There were also many different elements to these scenes so we always had something different to look at.Cinemtograhy, 10/10: Now this was excellent. If we didn't have the normal shots, we had shots that were shot in documentary style. Whether it was shot in those two, it was disturbing. I think Deodato did a nice job on making it believable that actors were really getting killed cause when I saw the trailer at first it looked that way.Plot, 8/10: A pretty good plot thought carefully. I like how they show the beginning, then they go to Professor Monroe and a bounty Hunter searching for the camera crew, and then after... seeing the shocking documentary that the crew have filmed. Too be honest I found the scenes with the crew the most disturbing.*Now the Animal Cruelty*. What was the point in the animal killings. The turtle was disgusting. I just don't get the point in them killing the animals because that ruined the film for me every time i saw an animals getting shot or cut or whatever.Overall this is a good film and a good one to add to your collection. It's disturbing and full of terror and the beautiful, tropical music makes this film 10 times sick as it is already. 8.5/10",Cannibal Holocaust
102,nebk,"This Is Not A Movie, It Is A Travesty That Should Be Destroyed",1,30 July 2013,"This movie is hands down the worst piece of horrendous trash that I have ever had the misfortune to see. It will make your stomach turn repeatedly due to unnecessary violence to both humans and animals. The scenes depicting torture of humans were acted, but the scenes depicting animal dismemberment were real. The words to describe this ""movie"" are shocking, graphic, disgusting, disturbing, depraved and ultimately unnecessary! Some reviewers have given this movie ratings ranging from 7-10 and I can't see any reason for such a score. Reviewers have written that this movie is a social commentary of evil and that it shows depravity and disintegration of human society. People have also written that animals are slaughtered for food all the time as if that excuses the slaughter of animals in this movie. Some have written that it's all right since the animals were eaten after the filming. I completely disagree with all of this. Knowing that animals were killed to film this atrocity will make you feel even worse if you decide to watch it. And I strongly recommend that you don't.I want to point out that I don't consider myself squeamish, and have no problems with watching gory horrors which are filled with movie violence. But this piece of trash is where I draw the line. This should not even be placed in the category of horror or category of movie for that matter.I will not go into too many of the details of acting, directing and the script because you can make up your mind if you ever make a mistake of watching it. I will also not go into those details because the acting is horrible, and the script and direction worse still. The ""premise"" of the movie (if we can call it that) is that an anthropologist finds film footage which a film crew shot whilst going through the Amazon Rain Forrest and filming the primitive Cannibals that live there. It turns out that the footage was mostly forced since the film crew terrorized and abused the natives in order to get the shots that they wanted. This was due to the fact that the footage that they obtained naturally was not exciting enough for them. The anthropologist takes the film reels back to New York and watches what the film crew did to the natives and ultimately discovers their fate as well (You might guess that cannibals don't react well to being tortured and murdered). Basically the film crew sinks deeper and deeper into depravity until their behavior is as savage as it can get. They become worse than the cannibals that they describe as savages and there are scenes of human and animal mutilations galore. A turtles is ripped apart in detail and women are raped and tortured. One woman is impaled on a stake and her body is left hanging on the stake. There is also disembowelment and obviously cannibalism of various body parts and appendages. Just plain horrible. I guess that those who described this film as a social commentary of the disintegration and depravity of society were right. They were right in the sense that those responsible for this movie are depraved savages who shouldn't be allowed near cameras ever again. Again, I advise you to stay away from this at all costs. It is absolutely horrible on every level. If I could rate it into the negative figures it would receive the rating of -10. Alas I have to rate it as 1 since that is the lowest rating allowed on this site.",Cannibal Holocaust
103,JeffG.,Not a great film.,2,5 October 1999,"As far as I can tell, this movie has only one real point: to see how much it can make the audience sick. The gore is so over-the-top that is ceases to be shocking and just starts looking ridiculous. The graphic rape scenes were unpleasant and unnecessary as well. But what really made me want to take a shower was finding out that the animals in this movie were actually killed. I'm no animal rights activist, but killing animals just because you're a dumb filmmaker without a decent makeup effects budget is just plain wrong.The acting in this movie was only slightly better than your average porn film. The score only seemed to have two compositions which got played over and over again. Particularly that dumb synthesiser music. The characters left a lot to be desired as well. The four doomed student filmmakers were so obnoxious I found myself rooting for the cannibals.As far as the ""Blair Witch"" comparisons go, I consider them pretty superficial at best. The ""documentary"" footage is mostly reserved for the last half hour of the movie. Also, ""Blair Witch"" relied on psychological terror and the power of suggestion. ""Cannibal Holocaust"" seems to have only one goal: to gross the audience out. If the makers of ""Blair Witch"" actually did see this movie, I would imaging that they used it as a blueprint of what not to do with their film.",Cannibal Holocaust

Given that we all support animal cruelty when we sit down to eat you may want to consider your cognitive dissonance if you are disturbed by the butchering of wild animals.

105,andrabem,"""Mondo Cane"" was Deodato's father, but the grandfather was called Rossellini",10,28 May 2007,"So many people have written about ""Cannibal Holocaust"" that it seemed futile to write another review when there were already so many of them, but the film impressed me so much that I want to give my personal view of it.""Cannibal Holocaust"" is said to be a very violent film and, in fact, it is, but there are many violent films (especially the American ones) featuring lots of blood, explosions, streets paved with corpses and so on. But the violence in American films is stylised, it almost resembles a video game play - the films are predictable and follow fixed rules and in the end the good guys always win. This kind of violence doesn't shock, it entertains.""Cannibal Holocaust"", on the other hand, shows directly what's going on - violence is a part of life. The film is raw - there are no good and bad characters - and the hand-held cameras enhance the feeling of reality. I was so engrossed that I forgot that I was seeing actors in a film. And this is no easy feat! When I saw, for instance, ""The Man who would be King"" by John Huston (the story of two English adventurers that become kings of a savage African tribe), it never left my mind that I was seeing a film. But in ""Cannibal Holocaust"", you feel things happening - a constant tension, a feeling of urgency fills the film.The soundtrack of Riz Ortolani is magnificent and helps to enrich the strength of the images. Sound and visuals work hand in glove in ""Cannibal Holocaust"". Sometimes extremely violent images are underlined by a soft and melancholic musical score producing a feeling of estrangement and perplexity. It it the brechtian distancing technique, or is it the lyrical glorification of violence? I think that it is none of them. All I can say that it's disturbing and beautiful.The exteriors were shot in Leticia, a small Colombian village deep in the amazonian jungle. Deodato and his team lived in small huts. Connection with the nearest city could be made only by airplane - they were on their own, surrounded by the green jungle, heat, snakes, mosquitoes, rain. They were shooting a film about cannibalism and the friendly Indians in the neighborhood were used to play the role of the cannibals. Far from home, inside the heart of darkness to tell a tale of horror and darkness. Tensions mounting. One day some people in Deodato's team went to a canoe trip through the river. They landed on a shore. They left a skull half buried in the mud, and one of the members of the team ""casually"" discovered it and said aloud: ""Look what I have found!"" Francesca Ciardi (the filmmaker Faye Daniels in the film) had a nervous breakdown and remained in a state of shock for some days. No wonder! Deodato was in command but (even if he was forceful, according to Robert Kerman) he knew how to work with other people. Weather conditions, lack of equipment or money made it necessary to change or cut scenes. Every new day could bring new changes. They were in an unknown land working in precarious conditions with many inexperienced actors (I mean the Indians). Only passion for their job could hold them together (interviews in the DVD released by Grindhouse). That is why the film has such a spontaneous feel to it.One can say that ""Mondo Cane"" was the father that inspired Deodato, but the grandfather's name is Rossellini. Rossellini filmed ""Roma Citta Aperta"" with few resources and had to improvise in order to finish the film: a small story (the priest Pietro Pellegrini and his work for the resistance) was enlarged , other characters were added, and in the end there was a long feature film, ""Roma Citta Aperta"", a film that amazed the world, because it felt true - it gives a living picture of the last days of the German occupation of Rome. The same can't be said for ""Cannibal Holocaust"". ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is, of course, a sploitation film and its aim was to make cash. The film is not a documentary and is not concerned about the truth. Indians and jungle are portrayed in a somewhat stereotyped way. But ""Cannibal Holocaust"" was really filmed in the jungle, and the Indians were in a way just playing their own roles. One can see that they are at ease - at home. So they act convincingly. Very convincingly, I should say! Deodato's passionate vision filters through the film - in the middle of the jungle, they were much on their own. They had to improvise and they were able to give us this powerful and beautiful film - very cruel, very desperate, very human.",Cannibal Holocaust
106,Kakueke,Brilliant job,9,29 September 2001,"""Civilized"" man's Heart of Darkness is explored in this predecessor of the ""Blair Witch Project"" about three young men and a young woman (plus a guide) who trek into the South American jungle with ulterior motives for a documentary and successfully find cannibals, but with less-than-successful results.  (How about ""Cannibal Apocalypse"" for this one, vs. Deodato comparable ""Jungle Holocaust""?) Unlike in the terrible ""Blair Witch,"" however, we see most of the characters most of the time, and although they are distasteful, they are certainly dramatically compelling. There are juxtapositions of the goings-on back home and the group of people that later track the expedition party, but the search for and confrontation with the cannibals are the principal focus.   Deodato combines extremely graphic displays of depravity and violence, torture and mutilation, on men and women, people and animals, for their own sake with his efforts to communicate ""who is really the savage"" and succeeds on both counts.  The explorers are young, greedy, and egomaniacal, willing to do the ultimate in damage to living beings as a means to their own fame and fortune.  The cheap, high-school character and mindset of the explorers, creating a false stage for themselves, magnifies the presentation of the worst white-man stereotype.  They are just jerks, and you enjoy disliking them.  Expectations and failure of the expedition are mirrored back home, in civilization, where presumptuosness and greed are also prevalent but then shattered. As for the acting (specifically, the main three, and partially the usually hidden camaraman), it was amazingly convincing.  It may be that the camera-within-the-movie contributed to this, and was used skillfully, in terms of distance and angles and selection, to contribute to the realism of a relatively uncomplicated situation of people passing through a jungle. But make no mistake about it, Yates and his companions are as believable, as natural, as they are repugnant.  And the overall cinematography, as well as the music, was excellent.  Yes, all this, but paramount is just the opportunity to watch the scenes in the last part of the film unfold.  You will not forget them.",Cannibal Holocaust

The film consists of a series of brutal animal killings and simulated human atrocities so realistic they landed Deodato in jail for a while and still inspire argument to this day. There is even a plot, a fairly adequate, if not inspiring plot that works well to serve up situations of extreme violence. Italian authorities seized the movie a few days after its first showing and tossed Deodato in jail. Deodato managed to demonstrate the special effects to the court's satisfaction and he was released. The special effects in some cases are so spectacular that against reason, people are left wondering if maybe Deodato didn't use humans or corpses rather than special effects. I'm not familiar with Deodato's other works but in Cannibal Holocaust he certainly shows his genius with gore. I do plan on tracking down his other movies and giving them a look.",Cannibal Holocaust

If you are about to see this movie, you should be aware of that there are real killing of innocent animals. Real scenes shot when killing animals. The director of this film, Ruggero Deodato, were in fact arrested after the film were finished, as the police thought that the killing of human beings were real. Later on, Ruggero Deodato had to show the cast in court. Still, he got charged of the animal killings. Please take consideration before turning this motion picture on. Make sure that you or the ones seeing this movie is 18 or older.As one of the most controversial movie ever made, Cannibal Holocaust starts off with a beautiful orchestral tune along with nice scenery over swamp and tropical environments.

Are Italians more in a chase of the controversial topics...?The obscene and perverse contrast between the beautiful soundtrack in audio and the total horror visually makes some scenes in this one... I am trying to find a word... disgusting. This is wrong...just wrong.Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Well... to be honest about this type of film and a globally phenomenon as Cannibal Holocaust... this is very bad. The story in the beginning to the actions starts to take place just hangs together on a thin thread, so to speak. Bad film editing, bad camera work... One thing that is very good...no...more than good....excellent; the soundtrack from Riz Ortolani! One of the best tunes made to a movie! - The actors : Both the director and the actors is so lousy that it almost feels that they sometimes read directly out of the script for their lines. This is so low budget that if it was an ordinary movie, I would have shut down a long time ago, and I was thinking that about 10 minutes into the movie. - Entertainment : How a movie with real animal killing can be entertaining.... no, no, no. I was just curious and watched this. - Age : 18, due to extreme cruelty, real killing of animals and nudity.4,2 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie.

At the alarmingly young age of just 13 years old, I was exploring the more lurid areas of cinema. I had seen the hysteria and infamy surrounding this film: the list of countries that had banned it, the various warnings such as 'If in doubt, do not watch this film', which of course was an invitation rather than a deterrence. Due to my age, I would have been hard pressed to walk in to a shop and buy a film titled 'Cannibal Holocaust', and I didn't want to waste my time watching a version that had been slaughtered by the BBFC, so I broke the law and found it on the now extinct LimeWire. I'd never downloaded anything before, I was sure it wouldn't work somehow. However, when the download finished, I opened the file and was presented with the opening scene, a shot of the vast, perpetual Amazon rain forest accompanied by Riz Ortolani's beautiful score. The realisation that I was now able to watch this film of unprecedented horror was so terrifying that I instantly closed Windows Media Player in a wave of fright. Eventually, I mustered up the courage to watch it; It was a joyfully intense experience. I never knew what ghastliness was around the corner, only sheer masochistic curiosity kept me watching it, this curious thrill being the essence of exploitation cinema. In order to clear my name, I must add that I have since bought a fully uncut version on the Internet! 'Cannibal Holocaust' is the father of the 'found footage' genre. The film follows Harold Monroe, a professor of Anthropology at a New York university who endeavours to discover what has happened to a young group of documentary makers who ventured into an area known as 'The Green Inferno' in South America. Eventually, he finds their reels and takes them back to New York, witnessing their fate in a projection room. According to director Ruggero Deodato, the film serves as a diatribe against the sensational violent nature of the media, which is quite obviously dubious and hypocritical considering the exploitative nature of the film. It is a very powerful piece of filmmaking; it leaves a lasting impression on you. The film batters you with its biting visceral force, which is both visual and aural. In many respects, this film has high production values for an exploitation film. For example, Riz Ortolani's score features both beautiful acoustic tracks and relentless aural assaults; it works with the strong visuals to wear you down until you're imploring for it to stop. Its violence is jarringly realistic, and notoriously on several occasions, completely real. I'm somewhat torn on the issue of animal slaughter; all animals killed in the film were reportedly eaten afterwards, and the animals were killed humanely, apart from the coatimundi, whose fate is the hardest to watch. I feel 'Cannibal Holocaust' is unfairly maligned; look at'Apocalypse Now', the brutal slaying of the water buffalo is ignored because of the massively high esteem it's held in. If it was a low-budget exploitation film it would have probably been steeped in criticism. The acting is tolerable, if slightly toe-curling in places, however generally it's good enough for it not to detract from how horribly effective the film is.www.hawkensian.com",Cannibal Holocaust

The UK censors did it a BIG favour by banning it for so long because it isn't worth any of the hype surrounding it. The animal killings in the movie are completely pointless and seriously detract from the overall quality of the film and the human death sequences are (contrary to most opinions) very unrealistic.

116,Ky-D,One of the better cannibal films,7,14 March 2005,"I agree with most horror fans that this is a great cannibal film, one of the best to ever eek out during the short lived popularity these films enjoyed.A group of film makes have gone missing in the jungle. Curious parties send out a group to find out what happened to the missing crew. along the way they are witness to some truly shocking events involving the natives, who seem to be unduly hostile to ward them. They manage to uncover the missing team's film footage, but the team itself remains lost. They return to civilization and view the footage, hoping to find the truth. They find out much more than they wanted to know.This is one of the bleakest to come out of the cannibal cycle. There is almost no humor, and what little there is is just about as uncomfortable as it is funny. It also has some of the most violent scenes I have ever seen put of film. I don't want to strip them of there power by describing their set-ups, just believe you will be shocked, or at least shaken. Direction is sharp, but intentionally rough, there are no clean edges to the picture.An important element to point out in the film is the manner in which it approaches the material. The cannibals aren't just a bunch of hungry killing machines and the 'civilized' people aren't all wine and roses. Characters are treated as such; as characters, not 2-D cut outs.Why not a higher score? For one thing the film takes a long time to get going; nothing much happens for the first half-hour or so. Also, while it is well directed and written, some of the actors play their parts a tad flamboyantly, reminding us that this is only a movie.I still highly recommend this to film to any horror fan that can find it, you will not be disappointed.7/10",Cannibal Holocaust

This isn't a film that you view and then forget.It grabs you by the neck and forces you to wallow in savage depravity whether you want to or not.A cinematic train wreck if you will. It isn't a good film nor is it a bad film.But it stays with you long after viewing. A documentary team goes into the Amazon jungle to film a cannibalistic tribe.They never return so a man is sent down by a televison station to discover their whereabouts.He finds many of their personal belongings with a vicious tribe of cannibals. He also finds cans of their film.The man returns to the states with the film and screens it for the tv executives. The film shows the atrocities perpetuated by the filming crew itself. Unable to get violent footage they want, they rape a few of the local women and burn down a village.As they move deeper into the jungle they find examples of cruelty beyond their own.A woman impaled on a log thrust out of her mouth gives the crew a warm feeling inside.These aren't nice folks. Naturally they meet up with gut munching tribe with the cameras rolling. I'm sure the director was trying to impress upon us that we are all savages.But there was a lot of wanton cruelty in this film including the skinning of a real turtle for fun.There really are no lofty aspirations to this movie.Pure and simple it is an evisceration party.It is well done and the soundtrack is fantastic.

118,Snake-666,A disturbing and damning portrayal of civilised society.,7,7 September 2003,"Professor Harold Monroe (Robert Kerman aka porn star Richard Bolla) travels into the jungles of South America to try and discover what happened to a group of three documentary film makers who have been missing now for some time. After locating a primitive tribe Monroe manages to strike a deal and salvage what is left of Alan (Gabriel Yorke), Faye (Francesca Ciardi) and Jack (Perry Pirkanen).They say there is a fine line between genius and insanity and I think in Cannibal Holocaust' director Ruggero Deodatto made that line as thin as possible. To call this movie depraved and sick would only give it half the credit it deserves because Cannibal Holocaust' is meant to be sick as it shows how sickening our own society is but in the most morally corrupt way imaginable. Featuring numerous repulsive acts such as a real live turtle flaying, a foetus being ripped from a woman's body, rape, castration and impalement the film sets about to portray the `civilised' documentary filmmakers as no better than the primitive cannibals. Even though the actors are barely competent enough to do their job it becomes almost enjoyable (in a very sadistic way) to watch them suffer at the hands of those they have wronged. However, from a moralistic standpoint even watching this movie is wrong. I don't think this is the type of movie you either love or hate on an entertainment basis but you either agree or disagree with how it presents its case. Cannibal Holocaust' is certainly nothing short of an endurance test in viewing as the senses are raped by the foul imagery constantly portrayed within. Filmed on a shoe string budget with virtually no production values evident, Cannibal Holocaust' has a disturbing realistic grittiness that is almost unparalleled by any other movie and a huge influence for The Blair Witch Project' almost twenty years later. I feel that because the movie is so badly made and the very fact it was produced is more damning to society than the events portrayed within many people feel that it is nothing more than a senseless bloodbath with no redeeming features and a hypocritical storyline  and to an extent they are probably right! Whether the viewer appreciates or despises this movie is totally dependant on the viewer and it is unfair for anybody else to make judgements on that person based on their opinion of this movie. Cannibal Holocaust' is not about a sharp storyline, great acting or superb special effects (though the unsimulated effects are generally good). Instead it is about humanity in general. If you believe you can cope with violent and repulsive imagery and scenes of unbelievable cruelty then go ahead and watch it but otherwise it is certainly one to avoid. Some people will probably find the moralising over such repulsive subject matter offensive and I can't say that I blame them. However, there is a message there and this movie makes an extremely bold statement. The question is though whether it was right to make the statement in this way? From an artistic standpoint it holds no real value but remains an interesting movie. My rating for Cannibal Holocaust'  6/10.",Cannibal Holocaust
119,alanmora,The most controversial film ever made,9,20 November 2006,"This is it...the definitive film in the ""cannibal"" sub-genre of Italian horror films. Billed as ""The most controversial film ever made"" perhaps no film is more deserving of that title than ""Cannibal Holocaust"". According to reports, the film maker actually spent time behind bars for animal cruelty due to the scenes of actual animal killings and torture in this film but this was only after he had to produce documentation that proved the actors in this film were still alive and that he did not make a ""snuff"" film. This is the original ""pseudo-documentary"" film designed to make the viewer believe that what they are seeing is real. Films like ""Faces of Death"" and the ""Blair Witch Project"" would later attempt to duplicate this style of film making but this is the first film of it's type and for this reason it deserves it's place in cinema history despite of or perhaps maybe because of all of the controversy that still surrounds the film today. Often imitated but never duplicated this film, with it's scenes of cannibalism, rape, murder, torture, bizarre native rituals, and animal slayings is a film that truly needs to be seen to be believed!",Cannibal Holocaust
120,RomanJamesHoffman,Hearts of Darkness,8,7 March 2014,"The original purpose of the Video Nasties list drawn up in the UK in the 1980s was to assuage media driven hysteria originating from movies in the unregulated video market and with explicit and exploitative depictions of gore and/or sex and which, as a result, were seen as a threat to public morality. These days it all seems ever so shrug-worthy as, stripped of the hysteria, most Video Nasties invariably fail to have any effect on the viewer and are revealed to be the bad films they are. 'Cannibal Holocaust' bucks this trend in a major way in both having an intelligent point to express about humanity's savagery (as relevant then as much as now) and doing so in a manner which, despite some patchy acting and directing, retains the power to challenge and shock even the more jaded modern film buff, i.e. me.The plot of the movie sees Professor Monroe travel into the South American jungle to find out what happened to a group of three documentary film makers who have gone missing. He eventually finds a primitive tribe who seem to have the documentary crew's lost film reels and through befriending the tribe manages to retrieve them. Back in the city the film-reels are shown to some executives and the full horrors of the expedition are revealed. So far, so typical exploitation Video Nastybut both the realistic depiction of some of the horrors via the found footage format (which this movie basically started and which would go onto to spawn the likes of 'The Blair Witch Project' (1999) and 'Cloverfield' (2008)) are so well done that there is a story that upon finishing the film and returning to Italy the director was suspected of actually killing the actors in the film and had to track them down to prove that it was not a snuff film. Apocryphal or not, the story captures the mood of the film and, indeed, the animal cruelty scenes are actually real and may sincerely disturb some viewers.However, the violence is not for no good reason. The movie is not about entertainment in any respect and instead sets out to provoke the audience into looking at society with a critical eye as well casting the same critical eye on our own dirty reflections. The film does this by playing with the sympathies of the audience and showing that rather than the cannibals being the primitive savages we imagine them to be at the outset, the ""civilized"" film-makers and executives are equally, if not more, barbaric and heartless. Furthermore, the film avoids the trap of heavy-handed moralizing and instead shows the sickness and brutality inherent in us all. Heavy stuff, and really not for those of a nervous disposition or those who delight in typical video nasty splatter-fest romps.",Cannibal Holocaust

Honestly, I think some of them might have been real. After watching them dissect a turtle, which was still partially alive with it's head cut off. I didn't think they were acting any more. They couldn't get away with nearly as much stuff in a modern day horror movie, which is why I like 80's horror movies so much, no computer generated crap.

This film caused well a history when it was first made and released in the US, United Kingdom and Italy.The basic plot of this film revolves a team going trough the jungle of Amazon Basin searching for a lost documentary-team. Professor Harold Monroe (played by Robert Kerman) is among the searchers. After witnessing a gruesome rape done with a spiked ball, they arrives at a village where they find skeletons from the documentary-team, together with some film-reels. Back in New York Harold Monroe decides to watch the film-reels in order to find out what really happened to the movie team.As I mentioned before, this film caused a history when it was new. Ruggero Deodato said his film was inspired by a real-life documentary which was much worse than this. He was even supposed to be in prison for the rest of his life due to the belief that the movie itself was an actual snuff. After getting released from jail, he wanted to show some proof to the Italian court that the human killings were fully staged. The special effects in this movie must have been so realistic hence this ""actual snuff belief"".Only the infamous animal killings were real, something which made this film to be banned in several countries like Italy, Singapore and the United Kingdom.This film is also listed as one of the 72 movies banned in the UK as a ""video nasty"", 1983.Norway is one of the countries where the film has been banned, but released completely uncut in the mid-2000s, rated 18.

actually understand why there was so much controversy when this was released back in the 80's. In terms of general gore, it wasn't that extreme. Honestly The Green Inferno and Cannibal Ferox were gorier. But in terms of violence and viscera, this movie was as graphic as it gets. Many moments throughout that I really wanted to look away. It really is just that brutal. All the animal deaths were definitely upsetting, but it added to the shock factor. The turtle scene was so disgusting I wanted to throw up. Jack's death was pretty brutal as well. Last road to hell scene was also very intense. This was the first horror film I've seen that truly shocked me. It's just so realistic in everything it does. The cinematography was incredible in this film. It also had a good soundtrack and a decent story. The message that the film conveys is actually powerful. Unfortunately, most of the acting (besides Robert Kerman) was pretty bad. The main point I'm making is that the movie is very intense and a very good horror film. One of the best I've ever seen.

But my question is 'Shouldn't there be a particular boundary which should not be crossed for defining Cinematic Liberties? I mean, if cutting the head, limbs and shell of a live turtle on screen, shooting a live pig with a gun, cutting the head of an alive monkey personifies cinematic liberty, then hell with such cinema.

Cannibal Holocaust follows an anthropologist traveling to the Amazon to find a missing documentary crew that were sent to film the cannibalistic tribes who lived in the jungles. After finding the lost footage, a news channel intends to broadcast the footage, and we are shown the grisly demise of the team. It's often referred to as one of the most disturbing movies of all time, and it certainly makes you feel a little dirty watching it. The torture and rape displayed by the indigenous tribe is just as shocking as the behavior the documentary team shows towards the tribe, so there's really nothing pleasant to watch in this film. One of the more famous lines in the movie asks who the savages really are: the cannibalistic tribe or the documentary crew. It presents some thought-provoking stuff, but it's so hard to ponder those themes when your senses are being assaulted by the graphic nature of this film.

They turn up missing so an anthropologist from New York University, professor Harold Monroe (Robert Kerman) goes to search for them. His guide takes him into the back country of the amazon that is inhabited by three deferent tribes, two of which practice cannibalism. He finds the cannisters of film in the possession of the Yamahoo or ""tree people"". He brings the films back with him to New York where they are viewed at a production company that wants to show the film on television but Professor Monroe wants them destroyed. The films show how Yates, his girlfriend Fay (Francesca Ciardi)and his two assistants grossly exploited the people and what they did just for a little bit of sensationalism. We see a small animal getting cut open alive, a turtle pulled out of the water and gutted in graphic detail. The rape a Yamahoo girl and worst of all how they burn a group of natives alive in their hut including women and children for absolutely no reason. This is among the saddest scenes in film history. The tree people take revenge on the ""film makers"" in a very violent way to say the least. The graphic detail has been explained on many other posts! Needless to say, after viewing the film the production company executives agree with professor Monroe!Deodato's intent was probably to make us angry at Alan Yates and his group for how they exploited the people. We certainly do not feel sorry for what happened to them and this gave good reason for their brutal and gruesome death by the cannibals. Of course the real exploiters are the film makers themselves. This film attempts to make a moral play out of the revenge taken against Yates and his group. Deodato wants to show the audience that they got what they deserved but really it is just a reason to make an exploitation film. For all its notoriety this film actually does have some merit. It is not a horror film at all in the classic sense but rather an exploitation film. For me this is as much an action-adventure film as an exploitation film. For a film of this nature, the cinematography and production was not that bad. It also had a beautiful score by Riz Ortolani. The jump shots between New York and the Amazon very effectively showed the contrast between normalcy and the horror that we see in the amazon. The movies weak point was the animal abuse. It is not only repulsive but a cop out as well. Just think of the artistic merit if the animal abuse was faked but made to look real. Now that would have been art! Unfortunality, much of the films credibility is lost by Deodato's and his cast's abuse of animals which would certainly be illegal to make today.

132,DorianWynHowells,You'll need a strong stomach for this one!!,9,6 February 2002,"My opening comment is true for 95% of this film - You WILL need a strong stomach to sit through this film!Made in '79, this film has been banned until now - apparently. A friend of mine saw it, and she commented on the fact that it's most likely the original inspiration for the Blair Witch Project, and a damn good film to boot. I sought out a copy and was not prepared for what I was subjected to....A group of four filmmakers go into the 'Green Inferno' to make a documentary about cannabalism....they are never heard of again. BUT!!! Before they go, we are given some info on other groups who have tried the same.....THEY too, never came back. Gulp!So, it's up to Prof. Harold Monroe (Kerman) to find them. He goes in search of the infamous tribe and does indeed find remains of the group. The tension building up to the actual discovery of the tribe itself and the remains of the four group members is good, and there are some great visuals.The tribe are, and later understandably, scared of the new group, they don't trust them at all. But, after a lot of tense moments, and some brave decisions, the group is accepted, and are invited to dinner!!! Human flesh! Nice eh?! Anyway, this is just a way of getting to the core of the film, and it's many messages. After establishing trust with the tribe, the group discover the film reels that the other group had used, and eventually the action moves back to New York, where the footage that was retrieved begins to be edited...And this is when things get horrible. Viewing the documentary footage is very hard, as some things happen which will probably offend. (gee I wonder why it was banned!) The four members of the group are clearly not documenting their discoveries in a traditional way!! Instead they provoke reactions from the tribe - burn their huts, rape their women etc. This in itself is shocking, how could 'civilised' people like these Americans do such things?This is the ultimate question that the film poses - ""who are the cannibals?""Sure, the tribe eat human flesh and other meat, but through the footage retrieved from the tribe which the group had filmed, the group are the real cannibals. Worse than that, they are the uncivilised ones.There is one scene where 3 male memebers of the group rape a young girl from the tribe. The poor girl now has to face death, due to her rape, most likely as a sign of cleansing, and freedom from the harshness of her ordeal. But, it's the way that she dies that is at first shocking then hard to take in. We do not see her death, but we see the outcome of it... She is situated on a pole. The pole goes through her vagina/bottom and up through her mouth!! Believe me, it's harder to look at it - you'll need that strong stomach!To make us as an audience more aware of the group's slow deterioration we see Alan Yates (Yorke) smile at first when he sees this awful and tragic sight, then as he is told the camera is rolling, he changes his tone and expression into mock disbelief!!! Now THAT really disturbed me and made me soooooooo angry!!!!There is a sequence in this film which also made me slightly on edge - there is a horrific scene of decapitation, castration and further mutilation to be had, and accompanying these visuals is the haunting score, which sets a care-free, light hearted, floating kind of feel. The visuals and the music both clash, and create a very uneasy feeling for the viewer!  
The trailer sold this film as a document of real events (Blair Witch?), and for the whole film, I didn't know if the people in the 'real' footage were real or not - it was THAT authentic. At the beginning of the film, a caption reads that most of the material was not edited for the sole reason that the director wished to capture the authenticity of the footage shown. I will not reveal whether the people in the group are actors or real people - it's up to you to discover, determine, decide etc.This film is clever, horrific, and beautiful at the same time. The locations that the film is shot in are both treacherous and beautiful.Some great performance's (or ARE they??!!), inspired directing, and a beautiful and evoking soundtrack, make this a must see for anyone. Mind you, after saying that, you should have a strong liking for the horror genre, must be able to think for yourself, and try to question your own reaction to the film's content, and as I have said, have a STRONG stomach!!

133,dmgrundy,Cannibal Holocaust,6,28 October 2008,"I think you have to see this film very much a product of its time: the 1970s, as every one knows, were a time of film-making excess (or boundary pushing, whatever you want to call it), and 'Cannibal Holocaust' is probably the most notorious horror/exploitation film from that period. Gritty, unflinching looks at the cruelties men are capable of, like the films of Michael Winner, with somewhat confused moral messages, often involving the intrusion of evil white men into the territory of natives who prove to be just as brutal in retaliating to the atrocities committed by said white men. It's often unclear just how we are meant to take all of this, and, while such uncertainty accounts for the films' unprecedented power, their deeply unpleasant, 'impure' feel, it seems somehow reprehensible (if no less reprehensible than Hollywood's increasingly overt glorification of violence, if it's to save cute little kiddies and is done by your favourite action heroes).So to 'Cannibal Holocaust'. Even more than Winner's more mainstream work, it's a misanthropic film, but, like Winner's, its targets appear a little confused. As another review I've read has noted, it sets up its crew of film-makers pretty much as straw men (while it may be true that news-crews exaggerate, manipulate, distort, etc, I find it unlikely that they'd go as far as to massacre pretty much a whole village), and thus muddies the message. Furthermore, while the anthropologist, Proff. Monroe, becomes the jaded voice of reason later in the film, earlier, he's not exactly a pillar of virtue, shooting several members of one tribe in cold blood so as to gain the trust of another tribe. The idea that 'Holocaust' is attacking the 'Mondo' films (some of which actually did stage shocking events) is rendered unlikely by the fact that, with it's attempt at verite-realism, it comes across as a Mondo film itself (at least, in the final, 'documentary' section).In making this film, it seems, Deodato deliberately plays up and questions his own role as exploitation film-maker (though by doing so he unwittingly undermines himself as well). When, in the penultimate scene, the TV executive orders the footage to be burned, one wonders if this was not the very same attitude held by those who tried to censor Deodato's work. For a film that exists seemingly to confront (and arguably, to exploit) the depths of human depravity, cruelty and violence, the Professor's stance (wanting to suppress the footage) seems protectionist, censorial. Surely it would make more sense to expose the film-makers for who they were (as is Deodato and the script's intention)? After all, their earlier documentary 'The Road to Hell' has been shown to have been faked, to some extent, yet people will believe it be real - would it not make more sense to expose the film-makers (and by extension, the culture of exploitative reporting that they embody)? Furthermore, Deodato's attitude to the native tribes is confused. We're supposed to sympathise, or at least, to understand, the actions they take towards the film-crew, to see them as justified; while they react with initial suspicion towards Monroe, it never looks like they're actually going to eat him, but the massacre in a hut pushes them over the edge. Yet what to make of the native 'savagery'? In one (infamous) scene, the crew come across a naked woman, impaled on a pole. Alan smirks, seems to be enjoying the spectacle, but is then told 'you're on camera' and immediately changes to a face of concern, pronouncing that this is the result of some barbaric sexual ritual, from a people who hold virginity as almost sacred (earlier on, in the film's first truly shocking scene, we've seen a native murder an adulterous woman by sexually mutilating her). Obviously, this is supposed to be yet another example of the thrill-seeking filmmakers' callousness and exploitativeness, but at the same time, it's unclear what moral attitude is being taken vis-a-vis the natives' 'uncivilised' practices. True, the girl may have been killed in this way because she has been raped by the film-makers in the preceding scene (although it's unclear whether it's the same girl), and the tribe's attitude to sexual 'impurity' demands such a grisly response, but that doesn't make the actual act of execution any easier to stomach.And of course, there are the scenes of animal cruelty. We see a muskrat have it's throat slit, and hear its screams of agony. Is this supposed to be just a fact of life - look, meat-eaters, this is the suffering animals go through to get you your meat - or just another cheap trick? Monroe shows a little distaste, but doesn't seem too concerned. The disembowelling of the turtle is shocking (you see its legs move even as its insides are being cut out), an effect enhanced by the score, but would it be appear any more palatable (excuse the pun) if it was done with care, rather than lip-smacking relish? At one point, a TV executive tells Monroe ""Today people want sensationalism; the more you rape their senses the happier they are"" (of course, she hasn't seen the actual footage yet). I don't think anyone could come away from 'Holocaust' feeling happy, although they might well feel that their sense have been raped. By pushing things just that little bit further, the film does succeed to some extent in exposing and challenging our attitudes towards extreme violence. It is strange how we find something like 'Holocaust' shocking and deserving of censorship, but have become immune to the horrors and deprivations we see daily on our news screens. Of course, Deodato IS exploiting his violence, just as his fictional film-makers are, and I suppose one could argue that the film's value lies as much in the issues that he DIDN'T intend to raise as the ones that he did.",Cannibal Holocaust
134,PaulyC,pre-Blair Witch cruelty,6,2 September 2008,"Yes, this film was banned and heavily censored in a few places for being disturbing. It does have some really well done gruesome scenes but the real censorship came from the cruelty to animals. Let's just say this film doesn't have ""no animals were harmed during production"" scrolling the end credits. The animal killings include a pig being shot in the head from close range, a muskrat being slit open for no reason, a giant turtle being split open in an overly long scene and a monkey getting his brains bashed in which required two takes so two monkeys were killed during production. These were real killings and not faked. A lot of the actors on the set protested this but the show went on. In fact, one of the lead actors feared for his life thinking this might be a ""snuff"" film and might meet the same fate. As much as this bothered people, is it really that different then buying meat in a supermarket? At least it made me think. The movie centers around ""found footage"" of a group of documentary filmmakers. The filmmakers are in South America searching for a tribe of flesh-eaters, hoping that this documentary will win them fame and fortune. The movie was marketed in a way that made viewers believe all the documentary footage shown in the movie was actual footage of a group that really went to South America to do a documentary. Some questionable acting gives it away. And you thought ""The Blair Witch Project"" was an original idea didn't you!?",Cannibal Holocaust
135,Illyngophobia,Cannibal Holocaust: A Film That's As Amazing As It Is Controversial,9,1 January 2011,"When I first heard about Cannibal Holocaust when I was about 11, curiosity gripped me like a python. The reviews on the film and the controversy only made the grip tighter, so I had to track it down for myself. When I first saw it, I was taken back. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. About thirty minutes in, I turned it off. Now, what feels like five years later; I watched it again. And I'm ashamed that I stopped watching midway, because I didn't get to finish what was one of the greatest films I've ever seen.The film follows Professor Monroe, an anthropologist who goes into the Amazon Jungle with a search party (Chico and Miguel), to look for a missing group of filmmakers; who had been missing for several months. The film crew had trekked into the jungles to do a documentary on a cannibal tribe. Through out the movie, we see Monroe,Miguel and Chico's growing relationship and alliance with one of the tribes. Their relationship is sometimes overwhelming, heart felt and beautiful. In on scene, Monroe strips naked and swims in the river; to show he's one of them. Several tribe women join him, and they have a splash fight and lots of fun. Chico and Miguel are smiling from the shore; and the mood is palpable. You can't help but to smile. Despite the tribe's sometimes distrust; they're relationship stays true into the half way marker of the film, where Monroe returns to New York.The film knows how to set you up.In the scene previously mentioned with Monroe and the river, the mood changes from very heart warming to revolt and terror; when the following scene cuts to the remains of the film crew in field. As well as an earlier scene, where Chico trips on a turtle shell and discovers the remains of another person from the crew, Felipe.As well as other scenes, such as the murder of a woman;who was punished for committing adultery and the killing of someone from a rival tribe. The second half of the film is Monroe in New York watching other projects by Alan Yates, the head of the film crew and the salvaged footage from the cannibal tribe documentary.The footage shows Alan's different intentions for being there; as well as much more. There are several scenes involving Alan,Faye,Mark and Jack disrupting the peace within the tribe. The burning of huts, the shooting of a pig and later; the rape of a tribal woman. Two of the more disturbing things caught on the footage consists of the killing of a turtle and ""surgery"" of a woman. The tribe ends up having enough of their actions and seeks revenge in the only way possible. The last twenty or so minutes, consists of the murders of Jack,Faye and the off screen deaths of Alan and Mark.The film ends with an executive telling the man running the film projector to burn the film. Monroe leaves the building, smoking a cigarette; and the film pans out a view of NYC; while the theme music plays. ---------------------- After the release of the film, it has gained notoriety for being one of the most, if not THE MOST controversial film ever made. It resulted in the arrest of Deodato for the animal killings; and almost for the rumored murders of the actors. The contract signed by the actors (in which they had to disappear for a year for the sake of realism) was broken for the sake of the court case. (Read the trivia for more about this) This is,in my opinion, one of the best films I've ever seen.You can sometimes forget you're not watching a documentary,but a Hollywood film.And the music adds to another level of suspense and terror with this as well. I'm giving Cannibal Holocaust a 9.4/10. Go watch it sometime.",Cannibal Holocaust
136,btkb,"It was interesting, but not a fan of it!",5,17 February 2021,"The word horror means ""an intense feeling of fear, shock, or disgust"" according to Google.I had to look up what it meant since I assumed horror meant ghosts and all, along with scariness. But this definitely fit the definition.It wasn't scary though. It was, however, disgusting and shocking, and disturbing. The scenes in there looked realistic, so that was pretty impressive. I researched about this movie, and I was surprised to hear the story behind it. Story involving the director and what happens after this movie was made, along with banned in certain countries. The animals were shocking to see as well.I am not sure if it is true, but people did say the animals killed in this were real, which is really unusual.I was surprised to see things that I would never expect in a movie, and you will see why.I recommend not watching this until you read the synopsis, along with knowing what you are about to watch. It can mess up minds if it is TOO much for someone.It says unrated, but this is definitely rated R, and possibly should be watched by someone who is older than 18. Maybe like 21 years old.I gave it 5/10 because the movie was pretty interesting, realistic, and was, in a way, adventuring, but the scenes were too much and not into my taste, either. It became a half good and half bad movie. It's amazing how realistic it looked though.",Cannibal Holocaust

What's so amazing about it? It didn't disturb me at all! I was really looking forward to watching this to see if it lived up to the hype, but I didn't much bat an eye during the supposedly ""disturbing"" scenes. Does this mean something is wrong with me? COMPLETELY OVERRATED. Not to mention old and actually kind of cheesy. Oh, well. I suppose, if you're a gore-hound this one is worth watching, 'cause it has boat loads of gore, and very little story (which is a good thing in my book). So see it if you're a major gore-hound, but don't believe the hype.",Cannibal Holocaust
138,chanelit-1,A mini masterpiece,8,6 August 2003,"A search team is sent to the Amazon jungle to find out what happened to a missing film crew, doing a documentary on cannibals. They quickly discover the film crew were devoured by the cannibals, but manage to return to New York with their film reels in tact.Once back in New York, the leader of the Search team, anthropologist Professor Monroe is asked to view the film reels before they are aired by a local TV station. He is so appalled by what he sees, he begs the TV executives to view the reels before they broadcast. They reluctantly agree, but by the time they've finished watching them, they order the reels to be destroyed so that no-one else has to see them.Cannibal Holocaust is probably the most (in)famous exploitation movie of them all. Its reputation to shock and sicken has remained in tact since its initial release in 1979.  This film is a true tour-de-force, skilfully made and an obvious labour of love for its Director, Ruggero Deodato (who had to prove in court that the effects used in the film weren't real, that it isn't an actual snuff movie). What sets this movie apart from almost anything else is its underlying tone of nastiness  it's all about the human condition at its worst; greedy, corrupting and power-crazy. The special effects are superb and almost too realistic; the acting is also top-notch (a genuine surprise given the genre).Where Cannibal Holocaust comes into its own is in the second half of the film, when we the audience get to watch the recovered film reels of the slain documentary team. Deodato uses 8mm hand-helds and POV shots continuously, making all the on-screen mayhem seem absolutely authentic. It's a very clever device that was used to far, far less effect in The Blair Witch Project' 20 years later.I won't say too much about this film, other than the fact that it is a masterpiece; it does deserve to stand proudly on its own (which it does) and have the huge cult-following that it enjoys. The only thing I would say is that whatever you do, make sure you watch the full uncut version  forget any butchered cut DVDs going around (such as the UK release missing over 6 minutes of footage!).A milestone and every bit as sickening and intense as you've heard  watch it if you dare!",Cannibal Holocaust
139,CyMaddux,Measuring stick for all Shock Docs,7,31 August 2004,"OK, I hunted this movie down due to all the hype it was getting on various boards. I managed to get an uncut copy on the internet for just under 20 bucks.Well, let me tell you, I'm a big fan of horror movies. Exorcist, Nightmare, Friday 13th series, etc. and this movie carves out its own little niche of uniqueness and brutality.The story centers around a group of college age documentarians who travel to a columbian rain forest in search of a cannibal tribe. Possible Spoilers ahead-----------------------Well, we see about 10 minutes of the footage and then the movie jumps to another group that is searching for what happened to these college students.The professor ends up finding the film cannisters from the students and takes them back to new york. A movie company wants to make a movie out of the footage, but the professor is totally against it. Now we delve into the actual footage, as the professors shows them exactly why they Don't want to release it to the publicThere is some really sick s**t in this movie. The squeamish should NOT watch this. I think a bit overlooked, is that this movie does have a message. Who is the real barbarians, savages? Is it the natives or those that have become ""civilized"" It makes you think whom is really at fault for some of the wrongs that go on in society.Anyway, the only real fault I have with the movie is that the students attempt to fake the tribal war between the tribes. The burn them alive, shoot a guy and kill a pig.. OK, these ARE students, so why all of a sudden are they the equivalent of serial killers/rapists. Would a film maker really turn into a murderer just to make a good film? I doubt it, at least not at age 22 or whatever.This movie, although gruesome, gory and wrenching, does have some bearing on humanity and I have to respect it for that. I don't care for the brutality of the animal killings, but they do set a tone for what happens next in the movie, and the downright barbarity of the college film crew.8/10 definitely worth watching if you can keep a level head (good luck!!!)",Cannibal Holocaust

141,matthewnoorman,Animal cruelty,4,9 June 2021,"Theres a part of me that wants to like this film but killing 11 animals at the same time making a film thats criticizing violence, that takes away all the magic of film. With that excluded you still get a sloppy movie. The acting is poor, the script and the director are full of hypocrisy and the same ruthless barbarism that its trying to protest. I do however find this movie to have some really positive traits going for it.. The violin music that plays over the more disturbing scenes helps to really captivate you and sends chills up your spine. The theme of media manipulation and double standards is truly insightful and ahead of its time. Eli roth states this is his favorite movie. The movie is good but is dragged down by it's murder of animals for ""art"" and a director who doesn't know his limits.",Cannibal Holocaust
142,johnmichael-2,Cannibal Holocaust: Extreme cinema proves to be extremely excellent,10,21 November 2007,"Riz Ortolani's pacific melody opens up the credits, which are printed against a sweeping shot above the Amazonian jungle, and the only hint we have of the horror to come is the title itself: ""Cannibal Holocaust."" Then the story starts, in which we learn the infamous documentarist Alan Yates and his film crew has disappeared while shooting a documentary piece in the Green Inferno: an area in the Amazonian jungle, the homeland of savages, from which no white man has returned alive.With the help of two guides, Professor Harold Munroe ventures into that Green Inferno in hopes of finding the bodies of the filmmakers. When he reaches the natives at last (in an uneasy truce), what he finds instead is significantly more chilling: Alan's unedited film reels, mostly undamaged and fit for viewing.But are they really fit for viewing? The second half of the movie consists mainly of the professor and his colleagues in New York watching the documentary before they air it on television. I do not want to spoil what comes next, but suffice it to say that it is both shocking and sobering.The first thing you probably heard about this film was that is was violent. Exceedingly violent. Such a rumor is correct. Ruggero Deodato achieves with $100,000 what our modern torture flick couldn't achieve with $10,000,000: graphic violence that looks and feels real. Sure, there are a few moments where the effects are obviously fake, but most of the time the violence and sexual assaults are hideously powerful--primitive to the core. Fitting that such acts should be associated with the indigenous tribes of the South American jungle, tribes that are reported cannibals.But then the movie raises this question: who are really the savages? Is it the uneducated, uncivilized culture groups of the jungle, or is it the ""civilized"" people who invade their lives and take advantage of their naivety? Who are we to consider ourselves superior merely because we have an easier, more fortunate lifestyle? Many people who sit down to watch this film do so in hopes of getting all the gore they've been promised. But what they also get is a great adventure yarn, and on top of that is timeless social commentary that will make this film outlive more than 99% of the horror movies that have ever churned themselves into the theaters. I am not exaggerating here. This film is a timeless classic.Admittedly, this film will never make its way into a mainstream audience. It is off the deep end of extreme cinema, and very few moviegoers will have the stomachs to stand this film. I recommend that you keep this in mind before you decide to watch this masterpiece. And make sure the little kiddies are tucked into bed. Or if you're like me, wait until your parents and siblings are tucked safely away in midnight slumber.Other aspects of this film: Satisfying actors. A mockumentary style that isn't at all distracting or annoying. If you didn't mind the shaky cam in the Bourne series, you won't mind it here. A musical score that is unforgettable. The main theme counterpoints the extreme violence and makes for a memorable viewing experience.Cinephiles: watch this now! Gore hounds: prepare to be satisfied, but also be prepared to think. Everyone else who can possibly stomach this movie: start stomaching! To those who don't fit in this category: I'm very, very sorry. You're really missing out.",Cannibal Holocaust
143,drunken_critic,Realistically fake,8,10 April 2005,"Cannibal Holocaust This movie wasn't scary, but what scared me was that it seemed realistic. It scared me because some of the scenes looked so real. The most amazing shot in the movie was the tribeswoman put on a stake. How was that done? That looked amazing, and I kept saying, ""No way! That looks too real!"" The makeup is too good. I kept thinking what is one dead tribes person? Nobody would notice in the jungle. Just maybe they really put an adulteress tribeswoman on a stake, and the director lied and said it was not real. That was in the back of my mind. I know it was not real, but I kept thinking, who really knows? The special effect (makeup person) deserves a lot of credit. Another amazingly realistic scene was the castration scene. Ouch! The ending of the movie was the definite climax. The slaughter of the end was amazingly realistic. This movie did the trick. It made me say, ""Wow, how did they do that?"" Any movie that makes you question what is real and what is not deserves some credit.I understand they used real footage of animal food preparation. That did not scare me or bother me, because what do primitive tribes in the Amazon do? That is right, they hunt to survive. This movie contained exploited tribe's people, if you want to call filming tribesmen preparing food exploitation. Who cares except Veggans and PETA? I don't mind seeing tribesmen demonstrate how to gut animals to prepare food. 78/100 high score for realistic makeup and special effects.",Cannibal Holocaust

It's too horrifying for words, and yet IMDb has a minimum of 1000 words, so here goes.Step by step, you are brought to a place where you hate the film crew more than usual. I think that the Nigerian executions are disturbing and upsetting, and it plants this terrible seed in your mind: ""Is this real footage?"" Going in to this movie, you know that it's staged and that the cannibals do not actually kill the actors, even if Deodato was prosecuted for murder on the basis of the film -- but you still have a little voice in your head asking ""How did they do that? This looks like stock footage of Nigerian shooting squads."" Then the atrocious film crew. They are smokers, and in 2014 smokers are always evil. (The 2014 audience would probably want to see people torn to shreds simply for smoking.) But no, they are murderers and rapists, too, and they make you want to kill them yourself.All things said, there is something wrong with the whole project, something morally objectionable.

While the feature is shot beautifully and has a truly mesmerizing score by Riz Ortolani, its hard to break past the aspects that made this film so controversial to begin with.Yes, the film depicts the actual slaughter of jungle-dwelling creatures. Yes, traumatic horrors such as rape seem glorified as ""just"" forms of punishment. Its not easy to handle... and yet, that was the goal of the film.Deodato did not set out to make a film for the masses. He created an underground feature for a very select crowd, but shot, edited, and scored it masterfully. Cannibal Holocaust is more of an experience than an actual film - and that's just what the makers of this feature planned.If you can stomach it, watch it in disgust, shock, and reverence.

148,brainofj72,A Brutal Profile of Madness,8,1 November 2005,"Italian horror - a genre as equally celebrated as it is reviled. The undisputed master of the craft was the legendary Dario Argento, famous for his strong sense of surreal imagery and and poetic violence. Then there was Lucio ""Godfather of Gore"" Fulci, who was something of a poor man's Argento, but the bulk of his work is still highly enjoyable and he has generated a cult following possibly even more dedicated than Argento's. And then there was Ruggero Deodato, a director who possibly could have joined Argento and Fulci in the ranks of the Italian horror elite, if it weren't for a premature ending to his career due to a scandalous little piece of work called Cannibal Holocaust. Where Argento was known for visuals and Fulci for over-the-top gore, based on Holocaust, it looks as though Deodato could have made a name for himself based on sheer unapologetic brutality.The film follows a researcher (Kerman) as he travels to the South American jungle in an attempt to find a missing film crew who were shooting a documentary on the cannibalistic natives of the area. The filmmakers are long dead, but their footage is discovered, and what it contains is among the most shocking brutality ever witnessed.If you're at all familiar with classic horror, then you've undoubtedly heard about Cannibal Holocaust and the ravenous infamy that surrounds it. The question that seems to hang on the minds of those who haven't seen it is: does it really live up to its reputation? The answer: absolutely. Don't be mistaken; it isn't gore nor is it actual violence that makes Holocaust so infamous - hell, almost any of Fulci or Romero film is gorier than this. No, what makes Holocaust do disturbing is, among other things, the unflinching realism of the brutality. Deodato was actually arrested and the film was seized upon its completion, and he had to present the actors in court to prove that he had not actually butchered them to make the film. I wondered, before viewing the picture, if it was even possible to make film violence look THAT realistic, especially back in 1980, but upon watching the film, I have to say that I can easily see why the courts had their suspicions in '80. Hell, the film would probably be brought under question even if it were made today. Though Deodato was able to prove that he did not actually murder anyone, he was still thrust into further hot water due to the fact that the cruelty toward animals in the film was real. Even after Deodato was able to release the film, Holocaust's future was to be rough, to say the least. Throughout the world, the film was either heavily cut/censored or banned all together, even in its native Italy. It actually holds the record for bannings: sixty countries.So yes, it is brutal. Yes, it is shocking. But is it really any good? Well, the film suffers from poor dubbing, a common affliction amongst Italian films of the era. This tends to be a big contributor in making Italian horror films so famously campy, and while Holocaust isn't repulsing with unspeakable horrors, it does tend to be a bit campy. The mediocre acting also plays a role in this. However, Deodato's direction is actually quite good, as is the cinematography and the acting of those portraying the documentary film crew. Riz Ortolani's strange score is also quite good; the film opens with a series of beautiful aerial shots of the jungle accompanied by a peaceful, sad, almost pop-like piece of score, and then CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST flashes on screen - one can't help but feel that this is an uneasy juxtaposition. In fact, the first forty-five or so minutes of the film don't really prepare the viewer for what is to be unleashed upon them in the latter portion.But on top of being the most infamous exploitation film ever made, Holocaust is actually a very powerful piece of cinema.*BEGIN SPOILERS* As the faux-documentary footage begins, the viewer is subjected to a group of ""civilized"" filmmakers who commit disturbing acts of brutality on both the less aggressive natives and the jungle animals. The desensitized manner in which these people behave is presented masterfully by Deodato and is truly frightening to watch. These men (and woman) slowly descend further and further into repugnant insanity, and this loss of all things humane and decent comes to a climax in a despicable scene in which the three male members of the crew take turns brutally raping a young female native. What makes Holocaust so powerful is the manner in which it presents the demise of these maniacs. Yes, the aforementioned rape scene is very troubling, but in a subsequent scene when all of the heinous acts committed by the crew come back around and are inflicted upon them by the more aggressive natives, I found myself asking: why is seeing the woman from the film crew violated so much more affecting than seeing the helpless native girl violated? Why is seeing these reprehensible people getting what's coming to them so disturbing? Why am I afraid for these horrible people? By the time the footage is over, a troubled executive who was viewing it calls the projectionist and says ""I want this footage burned. All of it."" What a powerful note to end on. (Yes, I'm ignoring the last ""Who are the real cannibals?"" line of voice-over dialogue, as it is blatant and unnecessary.) *END SPOILERS*Cannibal Holocaust is one of the few films that delivers on the hype.

It is one of the ugliest things I've ever seen on a screen. There is barely a story and the dialogue is forgettable. This movie also contains the murdering of some beautiful animals. Normally, that's ok because they're not really killing them, it's just movie magic but oh no! They kill them here. It's despicable and absolutely revolting and I have seen quite a few movies in my life and most things don't make me this angry.

I wish I hadn't watched it.First, they committed a lot of animal cruelty filming this movie. But I'm sure you know that if you're reading this. Humanely killing animals for food is one thing, but inhumanly killing animals for a movie is quite another. The animal cruelty was the most disturbing aspect of this movie because it was real.Second, the acting and writing are just terrible. The characters aren't believable. The writing and story are about as good as you'd find in a low-budget porno film. Four unbelievable psychopaths go into the Amazon jungle to make a documentary. While in the jungle, they terrorize, rape, and kill people. Then they are raped, killed, and eaten. There is a thin veneer of an idiotic message to justify all of this: the hippy-dippy BS self-abasement message that modern western civilization is no better than cannibals-the end.I can't help but think that they used that message to justify making a simulated snuff porno film.

152,eminges,Ten minutes away from immortality,8,11 August 2001,"Incredibly frustrating to watch.  I mean, the actors are carved out of balsa wood; as big a fan as I am of gratuitous nudity, do we need EVERYBODY to shuck out of their shorts, including the Professor?  And big chunks of dialogue were apparently written by somebody with a length of rebar lodged in their skull - ""Who are the REAL cannibals,"" indeed.But, lordie, when Deodato hits his groove, this thing ROCKS.  Several viewers have mentioned Blair Witch - how about Blair Witch crossed with Begotten?  The jungle sequences in the first sixty minutes, in particular, are GORGEOUSLY shot, the premise beautifully established, and this silly-ass splatter film you rented suddenly starts looking like a major work of artistic creation.POSSIBLE SPOILER FOR THE ARTISTICALLY SENSITIVEWell, Deodato loses control for about ten minutes.  He's not skilled enough to convince us that the first film crew is actually capable of cold-bloodedly going to the lengths they do to phony up a documentary.  It would have worked a LOT better if they'd at least started out fudging a few shots, rather than making the whole 'documentary' up from scratch. 
But, amazingly, he finds it again, and in the final sequences in the jungle he gives a clinic on cathartic violence that only Straw Dogs approaches. 
So if Coppola can rerelease a recut Apocalypse Now, why can't Deodato have another shot at Cannibal Holocaust, including shucking the drive-in-friendly title?  He's ten minutes away from a masterpiece, instead of an exceptionally well-done splatter film.

Unfortunately, the film displays neither the intelligence nor insight to be anything more than sensationalist tripe. This isn't even a horror movie.  It's ""Faces Of Death"" with a plot, and even that's a bit of a stretch since the story is strictly bare bones (pardon the expression).  The acting is pretty much non-existent and by the time the end credits rolled by, I found myself wishing that director, Ruggero Deodato had been devoured by a tribe of cannibals himself, thus sparing us from such amateur fair.Now, let me be clear that I am not a squeamish type when it comes to movie gore.  I think directors such as George Romero, Peter Jackson and David Cronenberg (to name but a few) have raised blood and guts to an art form. But it's painfully apparent that all Deodato strives for is shock value. There is no artistic vision evident here.  Just plain ol' exploitation. It boggles the mind why Cannibal Holocaust would appeal to anybody except aspiring serial killers who might get a kick out of watching animals being tortured and slaughtered for the sake of a dumb movie.",Cannibal Holocaust
154,dmc102,The Most Effective Modern Horror Film Ever Produced?,8,1 June 2007,"(1980) D: Ruggero Deodato S: Robert Kerman; Francesca Ciardi; Luca Barbareschi M: Riz OrtolaniStraight laced university lecturer Kerman is presented with the case of four documentary film-makers who disappeared in the Amazonian jungle. Leading an expedition to find them, he discovers a tribe of natives who feast on the flesh of humans. The most memorable part of the film consists of the recovered footage of the ill-fated documentary crew's exploration of the tribe.As repulsive as it is important, Cannibal Holocaust is a genuinely unsettling film experience. Deodato's relentless portrayal of cruelty and violence is by no means reserved for the cannibal tribesmen - the documentary film-makers are presented as voyeuristic and violent people.A comment on Italian 'mondo' documentaries of the 1960s and 1970s, Deodato makes a clear point about the invalidity of reporting on primitive civilizations when the film-makers themselves revel in the sadism and cruelty. However, Deodato's social commentary falls short due to his own actions during the film's production - the genuine slaughter of animals and the re-use of violent footage from a 'mondo' documentary are precisely the actions that the director is condemning.Performances from Robert Kerman and Francesca Ciardi are the highlights here, with fine supporting roles from Barbareschi and Salvatore Basile. The acting is generally of a higher standard than other Italian exploitation fare, as is the production. Music from Riz Ortolani is chillingly misplaced in parts, the score is one of the film's most notable achievements.The strength of the imagery in Cannibal Holocaust is the factor which, to some, renders it unwatchable. To others, however, it is the film's most shockingly effective feature. Whether you love or hate Deodato's exploitation film, you will certainly not forget it.One might argue that Cannibal Holocaust is the most effective horror film ever produced. For me, this is a perfectly valid argument. Never before had a film taken the unique stance of actually attacking the audience with such brutal scenes. Never before had a director blurred the line between fictional killing and actual slaughter to such an extent that some genuinely believed Cannibal Holocaust to be a 'snuff' film. Important and brutal, Cannibal Holocaust deserves none of its reputation as a 'schlock' horror film - it is far more valid than that.",Cannibal Holocaust

I was expecting a flimsy splatter movie and what I got was a film that actually had something profound to say. ""You think this is funny? then you're sick and depraved!""

That being said, the cruel acts in this movie are quite graphic (especially the rape scenes) and the effects do look awfully real.  This is a classic example of the cannibal sub genre and well worth seeking out if you're curious.  The movie is well edited and the acting is about a 6 out of ten; which is fairly good for a film of this genre.  The pacing is great and you never find yourself itching to use the fast foward button.  The message of this movie (that the explorers are the true savages) is anything but subtle.  There are three fairly graphic scenes of animal deaths that are NOT faked and some might find this fairly disturbing.  All in all, it was not what I expected, but still a solid movie.  8 out of 10.",Cannibal Holocaust

For a 30 year old film, it still reigns as highly disturbing. Each scene pushes the limits of the human psyche, whether it is the extreme animal cruelty, the over the top rape scenes or the devourment of human entrails. The film starts off with a professor and two well trained men going into the jungle seeking answers to a film crew's disappearance. The first half of the film is rather mundane with little intensity, however, your interest is still held. With that said, there still remains some controversial scenes to the dissatisfaction of the weak willed. The second half of the film, where the film crews reels are recovered and brought back to ""modern"" society, begin to slide into nothing more than an exploitation film. This however, is not necessarily a bad thing if you are into such. The camera view changes to ""actual footage"" the film crew shot. The rape scenes are somewhat over the top and not very convincing, and at times drag on too long. The animal cruelty is real and you do not get more convincing and nauseating than that. Having a strong stomach for
gore, I found myself disturbed by the beheading of the turtle and the stabbing to death of the squealing ""muskrat"". There are four other views of animal killings, however the impact pales in comparison to the two previously mentioned. The gore filled cannibal scenes of entrail devourment and the mass squabble for raw meat are gruesome, however typical fare for zombie films.In the end, you feel justified that the film crew got what they deserved, but are left with disturbing thoughts of who the real ""savages"" were, not to mention, how modern society relishes in the exploitation of others for money and for continued sensationalism.My rating is solely based on the contents of the film, the films direction and its effects.

The pathetic thing about CH is that, maybe, it could have been a better film without all the (animal) cruelty and the excessive gore, because it does have a few interesting aspects, such as the ""found footage"" plot, the film-within-the film structure, which would later inspire fine movies such as ""The Blair Witch Project"".
This was innovative back in 1980, and this movie also has a sense of rawness and freedom which would be unthinkable in these dry, politically correct times.

160,carlykristen,One of the most effective horror films ever made,10,10 October 2006,"*** May contain possible Spoilers ***At the beginning of the movie, I was treated to a very long disclaimer from the distributor that they do not want to be blamed for the content provided by the filmmakers. (They do, however, want to make loads of money off of it.) They even went so far as to quote Thomas Jefferson (?!?!), play the opening credits, then provide another disclaimer.This film has the most interesting history behind. It is famous for the real animal slayings and for being accused of killing real humans. Deodato went to court to prove the film was not snuff and appeared on TV with his actors to prove they were still alive. The film grossed $1.9 million ($5 million today) in the first 10 days of it's opening before the film was banned in it's native country of Italy. Besides for the sheer cruelty and ""realness"" of the film, they put fake documentary information on their DVD Extras and website (www.cannibalholocaust.net) to pretend this was real. I am not surprised the filmmaker was accused of making snuff.The basic plot is this: A Professor and Explorers discover the fate of a missing documentary crew that disappeared in the jungle. They locate the missing footage and learn what really happened with the ""savages"". The Professor finds that after the crew finds the tribe to be docile, they push them to the brink of madness for the sake of good film-making, with disastrous consequences.It is hard to side with anyone other than the Professor in this. The young crew members are shown at first as just young filmmakers looking for the truth. They have fun together, fall in love, and want to expose the truth. The real truth comes when the Professor discovers their footage and watches their slow decent into chaos. They become savage themselves by first killing animals, then the people. They suffer a horrible fate by the end.Deodato should be proud for blurring the lines. The direction here is excellent. There is a social commentary at the nasty little heart of this film. It speaks volumes of civilization, the effect of media on society, ethics, morals, etc. This is not a sleazefest as you would think by its outward appearance. There are nuances added to every scene that adds something new to the story. For instance, in one scene the couple in the crew is having sex in the jungle. What adds to the creepiness is when you realize that their friend is filming it. The camera slowly turns and you can see that they forced about 50 villagers to watch this happen to ""teach them how Americans have sex."" The sex was not put in this film to draw attention, but to draw attention to the complete disregard of humanity.{Portion of review removed to stay within word limit. View full review at HorrorYearbook.com}This is an incredibly effective and powerful film. It is too realistic to be considered entertaining, but it is the first film in a long time that made me feel something real. Horror films disappoint many adult lovers of horror today. They can no longer make you squirm or give you nightmares. Well, this one hit home for me. It might be today's events (War on Iraq, Genocide in Africa, Bordertown in Mexico, etc.) that make this all too real. I felt shell-shocked when it was over. I felt like a victim watching this as though I was assaulted too as these are crimes against all of humanity. At the same time, I felt guilty for watching as though I was committing the crimes myself by not intervening. There is a huge blame placed on the rest of society because these crimes do occur everyday and we sit and watch the news and believe everything that is told to us without question. This film will make you either hate mankind or want to hug your neighbor.I should mention the animal slayings. These are all real. The camera looms over the animals with the gore shown in detail. The worst part is hearing the animals screaming. The muskrat killing was the worst and almost brought me to tears. It took multiple stabbings before it was killed.The sound quality was decent considering it was shot in a jungle, but there was weird transitioning between dialogue and background noise causing a bit of ""popping"" in a couple scenes. The film quality of course was fantastic. The look and feel of the film was real giving the viewer the sensation that they were watching actual footage.Favorite Quote: One of the main characters says, ""It's Survival of the Fittest. The strong overcoming the weak,"" as a little piglet is tied to a stake in the ground, kicked repeatedly, falls down squealing, then is shot for no reason at all. This scene is real. It is said that the actor practiced his lines repeatedly then flubbed them due to the nastiness of this scene. They could not reshoot it as they could not find any more pigs to kill.DVD Extras: Audio Options, Commentary, and Trailers. ""Inside the Green Inferno"" gives detailed fake bios for each character, tribes, ""New Findings"", and the original script. Bottom Line: Do I think it should be Banned? No. For the disillusioned horror fan of today, I highly recommend this. It will blow your mind. The 25th Year Anniversary Collectors Edition is being released now. But for the weak of heart with weak stomachs, most definitely pass on this.

161,tomq5p,Extremely disturbing and misguided,2,22 November 2006,"Many people claim that this film shows how the so-called civilized world is actually brutal and violent. That may be true, up to a point, but the overall tone of the film still portrayed the indigenous people as inferior, stupid, and worthless. This film was incredibly racist in its portrayal of the indigenous people of the Amazon. The animal torture and murder was completely unacceptable and unnecessary. However, the point could be made that the same type of thing happens on an enormous scale every day in factory farms. The acting was utterly terrible, as was the dubbing. The cinematography was strangely captivating at times, and many of the visual effects were quite believable. The film tried to be philosophical, but it was really an excuse to make a brutally graphic, exploitation film that would shock viewers and cause controversy - which it has now been doing for decades. People do not watch this movie to understand how indigenous people are affected by the invasion of documentarians, settlers, imperialists, or any other outsiders. People do not watch this movie to understand the media's obsession with violence and sex.And, people don't watch this film to better understand human nature. People basically watch this film to see how graphic and disturbing it really is. Some even watch it because they enjoy the content. The former is understandable; the latter is upsetting to say the least. This movie is ""gore for gore's sake"" with a pathetic attempt at creating some semblance of a moral. That is not to say, however, that the film is completely without merit. The realistic style was interesting. The constant nudity (male and female) definitely goes against the grain. And, lastly, the effects were very innovative for their time. With that said, the overall movie was racist, misogynistic, cruel, and in extremely poor taste.

I'm not talking about the lousy story or the ridiculous acting, but about the mutilation of animals.Who on earth decided not to use special effects for this? Besides, this is one of the worst horror films I've ever seen. Horror films are supposed to scare the hell out of people, but in that this films fails big-time! It's as scary as Mary Poppins and the poor production values indicate that there was only one Saturday afternoon spend on writing the script. Well, the only thing that scared me about this film was that some people came up with money for this and that there are people who actually like it! 33 % of the voters voted a 10! Can anybody tell me in what asylum I can find these people?The makers try to sell this film as it was made as a documentary and that everything was real. A concept that was done much, much better by the makers of The Blair Witch Project. This is the only thing I have to admit that was good in the film: The concept. The execution is worthless. The main characters lack every depth and/or motivation. (They are supposed to be professional film makers, but instead they kill natives and film each other while naked).Cannibal Holocaust is a poor attempt to shock people, but it only proofs the retardness of the makers.

164,mrphantasm,A brutal shocking fictional experience.,10,20 November 2005,"One of the oddest pleasures in life is witness the work of a filmmaker who not just satisfies himself entertaining the audience, Cannibal Holocaust achieves that. After this trip to the deep corners of the savage nature of man, it's hard to forget Ruggero Deodato's masterpiece. As a cyclic process in the late 70s and early 80s Italian creators made for Horror the same thing they did for the classic Western in the 60s. In 1974 Tobe Hooper created a savage tale inspired by Ed Gein murders The Texas Chainsaw Massacre; Massacre shocked the audience for its raw cruel vision of the world. But the ultimate piece of cruelty in film reached the surface some years later.Ruggero Deodato was an Exploitation-director he could pick a movie of gladiators, spaghetti-westerns or horror movies. But for some strange design he ended up directing one of the most extreme, violent and gritty films ever made, and maybe to be able to make movies out of profit helped Deodato creating this massive work of desolation, despair and cruelty. Yet Cannibal Holocaust is not only a collection of brutal scenes, one after the other.Some calm and quiet music introduces us to what the world has come to name the cornerstone of civilization New York, but if the movie is comprehended as it should be, after the final titles close we'll have not only to feel disgust of how an inhabitant of the Amazonas eats raw meat. The first thirty minutes of 'Holocaust' work as introduction to the world of the tribes of the jungle in a semi-documentary style, after minutes pass we see more and more of the brutal human nature at its best; it's a crescendo of blood and death that crushes the senses of the audience more and more.Deodato uses nudism, and a wide range of cinematically avoided elements to transport the audiences to a dark cornerstone of the mind we know but we refuse to accept. Inside this distorted view of 'reality' we recognize we are not as civilized as we claimed to be. We are greedy; we kill for fun, money or lust. Cannibal Holocaust uses gore, which is as realistic as it could be, to be the ultimate lesson of how the self imposed habits of society create the ultimate butchery, that's the reason why this could be made once and worked perfectly once. Finally 'Holocaust' is a moral tale; it can be a real enlightening experience. There are little chances that someone remains unchanged towards this work, whether you define it as good or a bad movie.",Cannibal Holocaust
165,WOZ inOZ,Voyeuristically sick.,1,20 January 2000,"Finding Cannibal Holocaust 'entertaining' may well come down to personal boundaries of taste. For Cannibal Holocaust is an uncompromising exercise in exploitation film-making about as far as you can take it. It contains scenes of real animal cruelty, which are far more sickening than the rehearsed acts of violence in the film. It seems a common ingredient in a lot of cannibal films, which have understandably been criticised and black listed because of it. But for anybody to suggest it has any redeeming social commentary to make, maybe looking too deeply into something that is simply not there.
Admittedly Deodato (the director) deserves his dues, for an exploitation pic' Cannibal Holocaust is a lot more crafty and manipulative than most and is certainly the better of a pretty awful bunch of movies, but that doesn't mean it's all that good in it's own right either. Despite it's shortcomings it does manage to effortlessly attract the curious like a bad roadside accident, and has the same strange, unclean and hard to ignore quality, which ultimately becomes a nauseating experience leaving the viewer wondering why the hell they are watching this sickening display, something a few of the 'video nasties' have in common, the other being that most of them are plain trash. Cannibal Holocaust recently has collected more of it's fair share of attention, with people pointing out similarities with 'The Blair Witch Project' and it's use of 'lost footage' and a storyline of a film crew ending up in s**t creek down in the woods (or in this case the jungle). Unfortunately this is giving the cannibal film a bit of cheap publicity riding on the back of the more recent, genuine bit of clever student film making, that Blair Witch is. Personally I believe Cannibal Holocaust should remain an obscure oddity, because a film that delights in animal torture has no right to be more than even that.  Like I said in the beginning, I guess it's a question of taste, or lack of it. If you are on the look out for some kind of queer cheap thrill some may find in the carnage of an auto-accident (which lets face it, can be pretty horrific if you're into that kind of thing) or perhaps you are simply intrigued by so many people's comments, you may be suckered in by attempting to find this movie, but on the other hand if Deodato's disregard for both human and animal life sickens you (and I hope it does) as much as the director relished putting it up there on screen, I can only hope you're choice in whether to watch is more of a thoughtful than voyeuristic one.",Cannibal Holocaust

167,TrickTaylor,Didn't live up to billing,7,15 September 2006,"I had been waiting to see this film for some time, and finally broke down and bought the re-released 2 disc version. All the stuff I had read about this being the mother of all sicko films had me expecting a completely over the top film experience. Maybe I watch too many sick and depraved horror and exploitation flicks, but I must say that Cannibal Holocaust did not deliver the knockout punch I was hoping for.The plot needs no major highlighting here. Let's just say that the story follows a college professor and his guides and they attempt to find a lost group of young filmmakers who had set out to document elusive amazon tribes. The professor manages to make it through several encounters with various tribes and finds film canisters revealing the fate of the first party. It is the viewing of these canisters where the tension is supposed to come from in this movie. I will say that the idea is unique for the time and was obviously ripped off for Blair Witch Project.The first party of young filmmakers end up being total assholes who ravish and manipulate their footage, trying to show the savagery of the primitives, but only end up revealing their own violent nature. You guessed it. The primitives turn on them and horrible things ensue.To it's credit, Cannibal Holocaust takes itself more seriously than other cannibal movies, therefore it has higher production values and a decent story line. The scenes of savagery are nasty in some cases, with the adultery punishment ritual being particularly disturbing. My gripe is with the way the younger filmmakers were disposed of. The film goes out of its way to shock, only to have what should have been a long gruesome death turning into a quick slash em' up. They really missed an opportunity to let the cannibals show the full extent of their brutality on the film crew who obviously deserved it. A real let down after some decent build-up.Cannibal Holocaust is more vile and disturbing than 99% of most movies out there.

All in all I found it to be a pretty decent movie. Yes it has some graphic images but sadly this is tame compared to some of todays slasher movies. It also has a pretty engaging story which kept me interested all the way to the end. I really enjoyed how our victims demeanors transform throughout the movie. We go from our initial impression of the film makers as being victim too learning that it was they who were the violent sadists and that the cannibals were in fact punishing and executing them for their atrocities. A neat note: Clearly Eli Roth took note of this movie in making ""The Green Inferno"" which I am now very eager to see.

The acting is pretty horrific, the entire plot is a mess, and the violence is mostly laughable.If you enjoy fake rape or the totally unnecessary killing of real animals, this film is for you. I'm a little more interested in story, acting and directing, none of which can be found here. Ignore any and all reviews praising this as some kind of cult classic with special artistic value or hidden meaning only the truly gifted can comprehend. It's a poorly executed attempt at shock, and ends up falling well short of being anything less than an hour and a half of your life wasted.",Cannibal Holocaust
170,edgein15,Another totally sickening film from Italy--what a shock,4,6 April 2001,"Let's face it. Those 19-year-old Eberts in the making who consider this an art film are without a clue. The only reason people seek this movie out is because of the total depravity contained therein. So for the total gore hounds looking for fun, I'll summarize this flick for you:The REAL stuff (naturally all the animal torture in the film is sickeningly real):1. Muskrat getting stabbed in the neck, blood pours out.2. Monkey getting its skull split open by a machete.3. Pig being kicked, then shot in the head with a shotgun while the ""actor"" gleefully smiles.4. Giant (and probably endangered) sea turtle gets decapitated and then totally ripped apart.The FAKE stuff:1. Two separate scenes of gang rape.2. A guy getting his wee-wee sliced off.3. A bound woman gets raped with a stone phallus, then she gets beaten to death.4. A primitive abortion is performed on a very pregnant tribeswoman.5. Women and children are forced into a grass shack, which is set on fire, then they are shot while trying to escape. 6. A tribeswoman is impaled through her vaginal opening all the way until it exits her mouth. 7. And of course, there are countless scenes of naked people getting mutilated left and right. For any person to have the absolute gall to call this film social commentary should just take a look at any of Deodato's other films. The man is a Mondo hack, nothing more. Whatever sensationally offensive subject matter will offend most, he will include. Probably the only Deodato film readily available to the general public would be his THE HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK. Watch that little gem.

Utterly offensive, nihilistic and cruel, sadistic and torturous to sit through, this is a mean spirited exercise in exploitation that comes very highly recommended but with serious reservations. You need a cast iron constitution to sit through it.It's set up like a documentary and plays out as such and remember people, this is 1979, 20 years before the Blair Witch phenomenon, so this film was revolutionary in every sense of the word.It also makes some very powerful statements about civility and that the perceptions of civility are thinly veiled by a deep seated animalistic urge of survival in all of us.I personally challenge any viewer to not be moved by the climax of this film and walk away unaffected. It has a grimy, gritty grindhouse look to it and all this adds to the layers of cruelty on screen. I have some serious moral objections with the film, the animal cruelty is truly reprehensible and unnecessary and it's the reason the film loses a star, but this is still a grindhouse classic that will probably never be matched in the annals of horror.A Classic!",Cannibal Holocaust

Its not whats on this movie that shocks, its more the way it is told. What is surprising is that its quite a political movie, even an intellectual movie in its own right. It seems to be quite aware of what it is doing. Its a critic of what it is itself, and thats kind of what makes it so hard to watch. Thats what kind of makes it genius even.

When you're a teenager it's easy to think something as bizarre and brutal as this has an underlying message to it. 16 years later I find that it bears NO message. It's just a bunch of poorly done shots complemented by the unnecessary killing of animals. That's about it. I am a big horror and gore lover (Braindead, Day of the Dead, Re-animator, the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre). And I easily fall in love with depressing and disturbing flicks (Irreversible, Dancer in the Dark, Funny Games). The score (which is always applauded on reviews I've seen) is lame and mediocre, and the violent scenes are done so poorly you can't help but laugh at them. Animal deaths have no dramatic point whatsoever. This is not Apocalypse Now, and it is no OldBoy. When you see Oldboy's octopus sequence, there's a true dramatic impact to the death of the octopus. This one is totally stupid, pointless and has no true impact on you other than feeling sorry for those creatures. The acting is horrible and cartoonish. How can you feel disturbed by something this amateurish? That's beyond me. The one that goes all the way? hahaha. Guys, if you can take R.

It's graphic showing of, well, everything leads CH to be an extremely hard watch.Most people will watch this for one reason; the gore and sex. Well, it definitely delivers in that department. Did you ever want to see a native abortion, or cannibals raping and then eating a women? Then you are a sicko, but it's all in this movie. One thing I must question is the real life animal deaths, such as the three minute turtle slaughtering scene, or the deaths of coatamundi, snakes, pigs or monkeys. It was really unnecessary to do that, but if you really don't like that type of thing, there is an animal cruelty free DVD out there somewhere.The plot is actually interesting for an exploitation movie, and lends a great deal of added horror to the movie, as it makes it seem for 'real'. Also strange for an exploitation movie is just how well shot CH is. The visuals are crisp and clear, and the reels 'found' in the Amazon jungle are well shot to add every bit of realism that they can. There isn't too much that can be said about the acting, it wasn't over the top or fake looking.So why the (reasonably) low score, considering how much I have been praising the movie? Mainly because I personally didn't enjoy the second half of the movie, with the 'found footage'. But it is real easy to decide whether or not to see Cannibal Holocaust. If you want to see all the gore and sex you can handle, in what is probably one of the best exploitation films ever made, watch it. If you don't, don't watch it. Simple as that.",Cannibal Holocaust

I give the film it's due on being a strong statement about the state of humanity, and the exploitation and rape of cultures we deem base compared to our own. Especially the arrogance of white man.However, nothing I saw done to any of the humans was any worse than you see in your average horror film. Rape, and mutilation, unpleasant yes, horrifying and disturbing, not if you're a hardcore horror fan. Burying live babies in mud or throwing them in rivers, happens in reality people.As for all the people going on about the animal slaughter. How many of you people would say to my face after I said I was vegan ""mmmmmmm bacon"". Hypocrisy, pure hypocrisy. Kicking the pig before shooting it was not necessary, however much much worse is done to pigs in our modern ""civilised"" slaughter houses. That pig was lucky it died quickly, without being tortured first.I was waiting to see a living turtle ripped apart, because that's what you read in reviews. It was dead, and then it was butchered. No different to how other animals are killed and butchered for meat eaters every day. If anything the animals killed in this film were killed more humanely than animals killed in our modern ""civilized"" abattoirs. So if you're going to get worked up at those scenes and you eat meat, you are a hypocrite.How many of you would step on and kill a large spider or a snake? A horrific death compared to just being chopped in two or beheaded which is pretty much an instant death. Same with the monkey scene, quick and clean. Especially when compared to cctv of teenagers torturing kittens and pigeons today.Human suffering in films has no effect on me at all. Animal suffering does. However sometimes you have to look at images through a detached state to understand how messed up mankind is, and to appreciate the level of people's hypocrisy. Anyone who can't do that and loves animals I advice DO NOT watch this film or watch holding the remote ready to fast forward. I was ready to skip, but I didn't see anything that horrific.The special effects were probably pretty impressive for the time, and given what they had to work with back then the imagination used for some of the effects was impressive. However, how anyone believed people were actually killed making this film I really don't see. Unless I saw some ultra tame mega cut version.Would I watch it again? No, it was just OK.

183,ashturner-79373,"A brilliant piece of grindhouse cinema, and deserving of higher praise!",9,29 January 2019,"As is often the case with horror movies, one of the weakest aspects of this film is the acting, which is serviceable at best with the exception of Robert Kerman as the lead, Monroe. It helps that the character he plays is a very likeable one, who leads this expedition in search of the missing filmmakers with the best intentions - he immediately sympathises with his Yacumo guide, and respects the Yanomamö enough to strip naked and wash in front of them and even to share human meat with them. When he returns home to view the footage, he becomes, both literally and symbolically, the audience and the filmmaker at the same time.Seeing the story from Monroe's perspective means we see the aftermath of the missing filmmakers' expedition during the first half of the film, and the footage of the expedition itself during the second. It was a neat touch to show Monroe in between his reviews of the footage - at first he's eagerly trying to interview the deceased's families, but by the end he's advocating the tapes' destruction. One thing that doesn't add up, however, is why the filmmakers would have recorded themselves committing these awful acts if they were trying to stage everything - why film themselves raping a woman?In addition to some great gore and cadaver effects there are lots of haunting visuals, including the shrine made from human bones wrapped in recording equipment, the raped girl impaled on a wooden pole, and the numerous animal killings (which were genuine, and are VERY hard to watch). These contrast effectively with the more beautiful shots of nature and wildlife. The sound design is gritty, with the volcanic gunshots being most noteworthy, and the score is just amazing - from the beautiful yet subtly eerie opening theme, to the quiet, foreboding ambience of tribal drums, to the track ""Adulteress' Punishment"" which is beyond words.There's some great, albeit on-the-nose, dialogue throughout that puts the film's lofty message across nicely - that perhaps we're worse than the 'savages'. This is a film about ""children of the space age"" being consumed by a primitive world they thought they could conquer, as well as about the ethics of journalists that exploit the less fortunate for entertainment.I wasn't disappointed when I first watched this film.

But here is a film which does both.Cannibal Holocaust is the story of three documeantry film makers which get lost in the Amazon jungle. Later there film footage is the only thing left, and is found by a team in search for them. (Sounds like Blair Witch)The film contains GENUINNE animal killings which are extremely graphic performed JUST for the camars. This is what disturbs most about the film. Although without this unnesary killing Cannibal Holocaust would now be forgotten. It is there simply for shock value and to give the movie a much more real tone. This is the reason I believe people 20 years ago thought the actors were also killed (of course untrue). Although there is a scene which a native girl is seen impaled on a pole which looks pretty real. It was done with a bicycle seat  and a couple of poles, very simple but the effect looks real.Special mention however goes to Ritz Ortoloni's haunting score, which belongs in a much better movie (He also did the Score for House At The Edge of the Park) also for Deodato.

186,jukangliwayway,It's one of the most brilliant yet horrifying films I've ever seen and I NEVER EVER WANNA SEE IT AGAIN.,9,26 April 2013,"The depiction of such savagery (and im not talking about the actual cannibals here) is so disturbing it hurts my soul and body. Looking past the cannibalism, the graphic sexual violence, mutilation, brutal animal killings (which was real, adding to this film's notoriety), this is actually a well-made film. Sure, some may say it's not gory enough (that coming from a generation where the basis of how good a horror fim is by how much blood and goo was shed, or how many extremities were amputated.)This was made in the 80's and you gotta give Ruggero Deodato props here, he's a genius. From the camera movements, the internal organs (which looks so real that makes u rethink twice whether this is truly a snuff film and those were really from dead actors), and his ability to repulse his viewers and hate his film so much they feel so exploited after watching it and vowing never to endure such a painful viewing experience again.. then yeah, genius, as I've said.It is a film about media's exploitative nature for the sake of sensationalism. It's not about cannibalism. It's about human beings' innate savagery hiding beneath the guise of 'civilization'. I mean let's face it, despite our pretentious superiority among all other God's creatures, we are still animals. With animalistic instincts locked up by the weak cages of social norms and civilized manners, begging to break out. We see it on the news everyday. In history classes. That makes this film so scary. Because deep inside us, as we watch every brutal scene unfold, eyes wide with horror, we know that men are capable of what we were seeing. It's easier to watch ghost films or psychokillers bashing their hapless victims' heads because we think it's just plain crazy and unrealistic. But to see civilized people killing other people, killing animals, raping, lying, JUST BECAUSE THEY CAN,. It's beyond scary. And It's real.Awful. Repulsive. Horrifying. Insulting & degrading (esp. if you are a woman, and u see the rape scene, impalement, and forced abortion.). this is one film you will never want to see again But it's also one of those THAT YOU HAVE TO SEE before you die.

Not because it shocked me, but mostly due the contradictory and nonsensical message of this: We, the viewers, are supposed to believe that this is a criticism of how the media makes the public hardhearted and indifferent toward the violence, but deep inside, is just a vulgar, exploitative film that only wants to shock the audience. There is absolutely no beauty, fun or joy in this film. It is ludicrous and disgusting, but it takes itself way too seriously to be unintentionally funny or interesting. Ruggero Deodato shows us the most shocking and disgusting scenes, but unlike filmmakers as David Cronenberg, who are able to make the ugliest and most grotesque situations beautiful and poetical, those scenes are just plain ugly and tastelessThe title of the movie ""Cannibal Holocaust"" promises us a cheesy, gory B-movie, and yet, what it delivers is a dull, pretentious and heavy handed tale of human cruelty, without any kind of originality nor art. ""Cannibal Holocaust"" is a complete mess. It tries to be way too hard to be solemn and poignant, and instead of that it ends being just nihilistic and boring. Yes: There is a lot of blood, sex and violence in this film. Yes: The animal cruelty goes beyond anything that I had ever seen before. But it is a good –horror film? I don't think so. There are thrills, no mystery or anything that should be considered as horror material. Just mindless, graphic violence, without any beauty. That's all.

This is easily the most disturbing movie I've ever seen.  Not the goriest (that would be Dead Alive or Terror Firmer) or the most violent (Hard Boiled, perhaps?), but definitely the most disturbing.  Why?  Because unlike putrid trash like Cannibal Ferox or I Spit On Your Grave, this movie is actually pretty well made.  The dialogue is reasonably intelligent, the acting (at least by the documentary filmmakers) ranges from acceptable to good, and the hand-held camera keeps all the nastiness looking believable. On top of that, the score is curiously haunting.  It sounds ridiculously childish at first, but provides a strange counterpoint to the action that is quite effective (especially in the hut burning scene). 
If you read enough of these comments, you'll hear more than you need to know about the animal deaths.  They should never have been allowed to happen (the poor harmless young boa constrictor being hacked up was especially disturbing to me, but that's just because I have a pet boa).  For another thing, I'd like to know what kind of turtle is killed...it's one big honkin' turtle.  I'll bet it was an endangered species to boot.  The turtle killing is probably the single most disgusting thing I've seen put on celluloid. Makes ""Day of the Dead"" look like an episode of ""Iron Chef.""Indeed, the outrageousness of the cast of ""Cannibal Holocaust"" in killing these animals recalls the outrageous conduct of the filmmakers within the story who rape & kill the natives.  Deodato hammers into our heads over & over that the filmmakers are the real cannibals, the real savages, because of what they did to the natives, merely for the sake of their film.  But didn't Deodato do much the same thing to the animals, merely for the sake of his film?  I think this is either an incredibly stupid oversight of hypocrisy by Deodato, or a brilliant touch of irony.  Overall, I can't say I ""enjoyed"" the film.  Honestly, I hope NO ONE ""enjoys"" it.  I don't want to see it again anytime soon.  It's effective and interesting, like dissecting a frog in biology class, but I'd be a little wiggy about someone who called this one of their favorite movies.
I would warn those of you (probably most of you) who are reading these comments and want to see this film because of its reputation not to build up your expectations too much.  If you learn too much about its shocking scenes, they might lose some of their shock value.  And frankly, the true horror would be watching this movie WITHOUT being shocked.",Cannibal Holocaust

But I was not prepared for the cruelty of ""Cannibal Holocaust"". I've read a lot about the most controversial sequences of the film before seeing it but it was too difficult for me to not feel shocked with all the violence/gore of the film. ""Cannibal Holocaust"" was definitely one of the toughest movies I've ever seen. It's more than just an exploitation film, ""Cannibal Holocaust"" it's a like a free ticket for your worst nightmare. It's a ride you won't forget for a long time. Sequences like the impalement scene and the murder of a large turtle were to cruel and nasty to watch. And for a 1980's film I have to confess that I'm shocked how real it seemed. In the film, six animals are killed and those are really intense and gruesome scenes. It's a crazy, rude and cruel ride where you will ask yourself sometimes why are you watching the film but at the end of it, after all the evidences of this crazy journey are finally destroyed, you will understand that this is not just a simple horror movie. ""Cannibal Holocaust"" shows us the cruelty of men and leaves us with a really interesting quote ""I wonder who the real cannibals are."". It's a really graphic film and it's hard for me to advise you to watch it but despite all this things I've said, ""Cannibal Holocaust"" manages to deliver and accomplish everything a true horror-movie fan really wishes.

How did Ruggero Deodato know in the 1970s itself that the scenario he created then would come true 2-3 decades after that scenario was released? This film is a prescient exploration (done in the 1970s!) of the age of exploitation and voyeurism that we are living in now. Yes, CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST has its shortcomings. At times, the film seems amateurish. But that is maybe because the film required that raw look. As for the violence shown in the film, yes, it's graphic, but that perhaps compares nothing to the age we are living in now. I wonder if CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST would create any ripple now, when videos of public beheadings are easily available on the internet and circulated via WhatsApp?

193,husks,Effectively shocking,9,2 February 2008,"Viewing even the first part of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, it's easy to wonder what all the fuss is about. The film is fascinating in the sense that the locations weren't really scouted and the process required amazing pains by the cast and crew. Kerman particularly does an outstanding job. But the film itself isn't truly special, at least not to the extent where it should still remembered twenty-five years later. Even the scenes with Kerman and the tribe seem staged when there is no conceivable reason for them to. It plays like NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC without the cinema verite'.When they go into the jungle, things change dramatically. At first, it is the extremely disturbing slaughtering of a tortoise who probably lived well over a hundred years before Alan's crew (and Deodato's if we're being entirely fair) came along. Even Faye is unable to take this as she vomits at the sight of the mutilated animal, betraying her tough exterior. Ciardi truly was disgusted by this and her revulsion is not faked. The rest of the group gleefully tears into the creature. Yet, we are taught to simply place this in the context of documentary objectivity. Just the other day, I saw a random image on one of the nature channels. An elk slips through the ice, kicking and screaming and according to the narrator, taking a long time to finally drown. What is left unsaid is that in all that time, the crew never attempted to intervene in the animal's painful death. After all, they had to retain their objectivity and let nature take its course. I can't help but think that the elk may have disagreed. I would never approve of cruelty to animals, but I merely point out that Deodato practiced the same horrible things documentary filmmakers do to this day.The crew continues to stumble upon or instigate several grisly happenings. As they record every moment, they remind themselves to feign shock and disgust so the audience will not see them as monsters. Looking at the raw footage we know they are more interested in filming violence and tragedy than preventing it. To be fair, Deodato's motives also remain unclear.When the crew is left without their guide in the jungle, things look ominous, but they play up their quandary, focusing on the work. They do meet up with the tribe and find that while the images are interesting, they just aren't very good television. Under the guise of a nonexistent war between tribes, the crew themselves comes in with their modern technology and brutalizes the tribe. The tribe, which has it's own barbaric customs (including a disgusting reprimand against adulterous wives) are actually not as savage as the advanced interlopers. Eventually, they even massacre them in a scene that recalls the American devastation of Vietnamese villages like Mei Lai.Things don't continue to go as well for the crew as they try to make their way out of the jungle. The cannibals hunt them down and their footage details their shocking demise. It's brutal and heartbreaking, yet none of us could honestly say the filmmakers didn't get what was coming for them.",Cannibal Holocaust

Take away all the actual animal killing and what you have left is a piece of crap. The acting was awful. The only performer that seemed to have some type of acting skills was a porn actor. So in a nutshell, what you have is a porn actor as your star, actual killing of animals, rape scenes, and killing. Really stupid story. Real bad. Probably the worst film I have ever seen. 0/10.",Cannibal Holocaust
195,derekbellas,"One of the best, scariest, nastiest movies out there.",8,14 April 2016,"Cannibal Holocaust tells the story of a film crew that was lost in the amazon while filming a documentary on life in the jungle. Their camera reveals the a horrifying truth about what really happens away from civilized society. From start to finish, the movie is filled with shocking and graphic moments, so if you get squeamish at the thought of cannibalism, I would recommend steering clear of this movie.When people tell you not to watch this movie, they mean it. I saw this when I was 15 after I was told by several people it was too intense for anyone. I thought I would be able to handle it, since I watch a lot of scary, intense, and gory movies, but Cannibal Holocaust too it to a whole new level.Even though this movie is extremely well made, and delivers it's message well, the one major thing I don't like about this movie it it's REAL animal cruelty scenes. Yes, actual animals were killed while this movie was being filmed, and it was all caught on camera. I could have gone my whole life without seeing those scenes, and I would have died a happy man, but not anymore.",Cannibal Holocaust

""Cannibal Holocaust""... this film was banned around the world and I can understand why... definitely not a film for everyone... but i really have to say this is one of the best films that i've seen which really touched on a lot of questions about humanity... i was glad the director decided to take this film to the extreme... some of the modern films really did a rip off of this one such as ""Hannibal"" (of course), ""Blair witch project"", and all the cannibal films that came after it....I think the director did a good job on explaining why he decided to portray the violent extremnism in this film... there was the constant contrast between eating a human and eating an animal... he showed both the savageness of civilized society and the jungle people... the last line of the film pretty much explained everything ""I wonder who's the real cannibals""... this also brings up the usual question of knowledge and innocence... such as that the jungle people eat flesh for survival which they do not know the difference btwn eating a man and a pig for they are innocent... but civilized society hunt animals for entertainment, we kill and consume food beyond our needs ... i definitely dont think the intensions of this film was to gross anyone out but to raise some questions about us as human beings... and it also portrayed a different kind of reality like all the other films out there that try to show reality as it is... i think this film can be talked about in deep context and im glad i was able to find it.",Cannibal Holocaust
197,Mondo-Cane,A diamond in the rough......,10,17 December 2001,"I first heard about Cannibal Holocaust, through the internet. My initial curiosity and desire to see the film was because it was supposedly the most violent and gory film made, which is a subject matter than can be debated. But when I eventually got a copy of this I was blown away.The opening of the film has probably some of the most beautiful music I ever heard,while filming shots of the Amazon from bird's eye view.I was surprised to see that this film was much more than a violence fest. I would be lying if I said that the violence in the movie is insignificant to it's underlying message because it's not. There are real animal killings which are pretty brutal to watch, but on the lighter side, the animals killed were eaten by cast and crew after filming, so they did not die for the viewer's entertainment or whatever.Cannibal Holocaust can be called ahead of it's time, due to the fact that makes you question watching reality as entertainment, and where to draw the line. Also themes of consumerism, the media, and what it means to be civilized are present within the killings,flesh eating,rape,sexual assault,torture,and other such extreme things filmed. I would compare this to Clockwork Orange in the means that there is a message in the madness.And it was quite obvious where the Blair Witch creators got their inspiration from, this movie.",Cannibal Holocaust

There wasn't much of a story line but it didn't really need much.Anyone who can stand animal cruelty will be fine but I just cant see any animals being hurt and those parts really upset me - and im a HUGE horror fan and can watch anything but I definitely cant watch animals being hurt.Very well made for the year and budget, and there is nothing else out there like this movie which makes it even more interesting.

A wonderful music is rendered by Riz Ortolani which in an excellent way complements the plot. There's an extreme violence right from the beginning. Many of my friends could not watch the complete movie. Such gore it has.As the movie progresses, it becomes increasingly disturbing. There are claims and allegations that the people are really killed in the movie while it was shot. It might be false. But such a doubt to arise in the people's mind, the maker of the movie should have done a wonderful job.There are many gory movies but none can come near this one. This is a cult-classic.

201,Dr_Drew_Says,Dr. Drew says... 6 out of 10,6,11 October 2013,"Cannibal Holocaust (1980): The Good, the Bad and the Necessary?Synopsis: A team of documentary filmmakers go missing deep in the Amazonian jungle in the search for legendary cannibal tribes never before captured on film. A rescue team is sent to try and ascertain their fate, only to find a gruesome discovery and the film left behind to tell the tale.The Good: The idea is a brilliant one and it gives us one of, if not THE earliest found footage films. But let's skip to the chase here... the question is whether or not the idea works... and I would say the answer is mostly yes. Whenever cannibalism is the concept, the idea is to shock, because that's why the idea of cannibalism is so appalling. The idea that someone could eat human flesh is a primitive and rather nasty proposition. If you see a movie titled ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and you think you are not going to see gore that is meant to shock the senses, I am not sure what you are expecting. So if it's shock value they went for, then yes... they definitely did what they set out to do. While the film tiptoes the line of believability, I think the graphic scenes mostly do what they set out to do... which is shock the senses. I do have to admit though, I am a hunter, so some of the animal kills (which I believe to be 100% real) weren't nearly as effective to me as I am sure they were to others. There were certainly times where you could tell things were fake, but when they threw in REAL animal deaths, it made you wonder about the validity of the ""found footage"". That is an effective film, because it did what it set out to do.The Bad: This is certainly a tale of two films. The first 40 minutes is about the attempt to find the missing filmmakers. It is not shot as found footage, so it is just meant to be a movie. Then, the last 50 minutes is some council of sorts watching the footage and trying to determine whether or not to publish it. So some of it works and some of it doesn't. The film's opening leads you to believe that it's all a documentary, so that's what I was expecting. So 15 minutes into the film, I was scratching my head a little that it didn't seem to be filmed documentary style. The beginning is a little slow moving and like I said, it takes a full 40 minutes to figure out what happened to the crew and find the lost footage. While there is some initial shock (tribal rape), the first part of the film is relatively tame and almost a bit boring. The non-tribal actors are not very good either, both in the film part or the found footage, which certain detracts from the ""authenticity"" aspect of the film. The crew just doesn't act natural enough. Speaking of the crew, they are my biggest beef with the film. So a noteworthy documentary crew goes to great lengths to film ancient tribes and their rituals and really they are just hacks that stage everything to make a buck? I don't buy it. Usually documentary film makers have a passion and love for what they do, which is why they usually don't make much money or become famous. They tell stories that mean something to them and that most of us would otherwise not see. So instead of filming with those values in mind, they torment, rape and burn the villages of the locals simply to get good footage? Bah... like I said, I don't buy it.The Necessary?: The question I asked myself as I sat through this film was ""is this a necessary thing to have to show?"" I mean, certainly cannibalism has a past and possibly even a present in this world. It is fact that certain cultures have practiced cannibalism as a way of life or part of religious beliefs, so certainly there is a tale to tell. However, is it needing to be told under the guise of ""horror"" or ""shock value""? It's a tough question, because most horror films are meant to shock your senses. I guess maybe the component that is different is that rape, torture, mutilation and cannibalism exists and the story is shown in a way where you are meant to believe it as real footage. This is why it is shocking to the viewers, even if they know the found footage isn't real. It's done well enough to be disturbing... especially given that there is enough real animal death footage to add to the ""real footage"" claim. It was certainly done to add authenticity and it works, right or wrong. Most will argue that real animals shouldn't have to die just so some sickos can enjoy being shocked watching a movie and I heartily agree. Still, there is a raw, disturbing feel to watching this because it affects you and that's what films are made to do (especially the rape scenes, which were hard for me to stomach, because there is no joy or entertainment value in it). There's no doubt you end the movie feeling like you saw something different. Regardless of whether you feel repulsed, angry, sad, cheap or even guilty after watching this movie, the fact that you felt strong emotion means the film worked and did what it set out to do. For that alone, the film is a success. Me personally, I didn't think it was overly disturbing aside from the rape scenes and the animal deaths were nothing I haven't seen in real life (although the monkey killing is quite disturbing). It's worth a watch if you can handle the content. Just know what you are watching before you hit play.",Cannibal Holocaust
202,qiowisj,Thoughtful exploitation,7,13 November 2006,"A great deal's been said about Ruggero Deodato's grindhouse ""masterpiece"". That it's been banned in numerous countries, real animals are slaughtered on camera, or many believed it was an actual snuff film.Digression aside, should a person watch Cannibal Holocaust? Yes and no. The sensational title leaves no doubt that it is not proper viewing for everyone. Even many disreputable 42nd Street moviegoers thought the movie too intense. With that said, film buffs looking for a little more extreme cinema may as well start here. Cannibal Holocaust is considered the epitome of this particular genre. The jerky hand-held camera movements and plot can be widely recognized in future films such as The Last Broadcast and Blair Witch Project. Examination of media violence was covered here long before Natural Born Killers; Deodato has gone on record as saying that Oliver Stone is a fan of his pseudo-documentary.In the final analysis, Cannibal Holocaust should be commended to a degree for its out and out ballsiness.

205,gibbog,"Interesting, slightly disturbing film",6,11 April 2005,"This is another in the long line of films that you hear so much about that if you are at all curious, you have to see.I bought a copy off of eBay after having downloaded a version a year ago.I only skipped through the downloaded copy to see if what all of the reviews were saying was true.For the most part the reviews were right. This is a pretty disturbing film. The thought of cannibalistic tribes existing is not a pleasant thought. Some of the images are a bit shocking, there is no question. There are scenes of animals being killed. While this is a common occurrence, and is something that can be seen on the Discovery Channel, it seems a little too much as it is presented here. Yes, the tribes had to live off of food they caught and killed. It's just a bit too much to include for the sake of a film.There is also a lot of rape and brutalization of women. In one gruesome scene, an adulterous woman gets raped, with a stone, has mud stuffed into her, and is bludgeoned to death with the same stone. In another scene, a pregnant tribe member literally has a fetus pulled from her and then the fetus is buried in the mud. The woman is then stoned by other female villagers.The cannibal scenes themselves are not the most gory part of the film. Yes the tribes do eat human meat, but they are not ripping and gnawing at anyone as you might expect. The fate of the original camera crew is indeed brutal, and in fact was partly brought on by the way they treated the natives. The four Americans did savage and provoke the tribes into further violent behavior. Not to excuse cannibalism by any means, but as Professor Monroe says, ""I wonder who are the savages""? I found it hard to feel any sympathy for the documentary film crew. They were a pretty idiotic bunch, and as stated previously they treated the tribes terribly. Prof. Monroe was easy to side with, as he clearly saw that the concern over the film crew was overshadowing their nasty behavior, and lust for making a ground-breaking film. It was only towards the end of the film that I could sympathize with Faye, as she was the only one with any conscience.One thing I found so odd about this film was the soundtrack. The theme playing during the opening and closing credits seemed a little too happy for such a serious movie. As for the rest of the music it was great, and fit very well with the feel and look of the film.All in all, not a bad film. Deodato did a great job with the jungle locations (though the editing was a bit choppy). Pretty much what I expected after reading the hype.Rating: 6 out of 10",Cannibal Holocaust

If you think this is the type of movie to watch while with your girlfriend than your sadly mistaken. This isn't your normal horror movie its not even horror at all its a total new genre in itself. some scenes in this film really make you think (what was the filmmaker thinking?) from a slicing open of a little rodent animal to a innocent tourtoise being sliced and diced. the film really crosses the line and makes you appreciate you don't live in the amazon.

207,MikeRydal,Must see for true horror fans,10,16 May 2011,"Lets get this bit out of the way first.As I'm sure you are already aware, this is possibly the most notoriously banned movie ever made. It features animal killings in extremely graphic detail and, rightly so, was banned. As a reviewer, i do not condone the use of such acts in film making, but whats this brings to the film is quite astonishing in effect. On with the ReviewThe violent nature of this film is well documented, and its my belief that overshadows the incredible direction of the film. It is a film of 2 halves. The first, is the story of a professors search for a group of film makers who were documenting cannibalistic tribes. The search leads the Professor to the jungle, where he meets with a team of trackers who agree to take him to the tribal village where the documentarians were last seen.This journey sets the tone beautifully, its a well executed insight to the tribes way of life, a brutal, savage and alien world. The direction is wonderful, Deodato, as brutal as his methods were, captures the essence superbly, as beautiful as it is horrific.Upon reaching the tribal village, the professor discovers the remains of the young film makers and manages to acquire the film canisters containing the footage that the documentarians had shot.The 2nd half of the film is the reviewing of the footage found by the professor, what ensues is a truly horrific masterpiece of cinema.The footage shows the story of Alan Yates and his team. as they trek their way, unmercilessly, through the jungle to capture the footage they want at whatever cost.As they quite unsympathetically brutalise the tribes people to film their reactions, they become almost drunk with power, as they rape, pillage and destroy their way through the tribes village. Deodato builds these characters so well that you develop a hatred for them, which in turn, makes you cheer on the cannibal tribes to dispose of them. Despite its grotesque nature, the climax is incredibly satisfying.Credit to the director Like i said at the start of this review, i do not condone the killing of animals for the sake of entertainment. But this is an incredibly well directed picture, the pace of the film keeps you watching till the end. The music is astonishing. In the scene where the film makers are burning the village, the main theme plays, which is a soothing piece of music, quite an irony to nature of the film. It adds so much to the main characters, it makes them seem innocent yet they are the ones who are savage.Overall This movie excels all expectations, and Deodato made sure of that. Its a gripping story that is well executed. Inspite of its obvious disrepute, this is a fantastic horror flick, it shocks, scares and disgusts to an extreme level. If you are a lover of horror, then this is a must watch.",Cannibal Holocaust

This was of course not correct, but since the movie was banned in Norway, and rumors went out of control, I didn't know better. Not good for a kid...But, you should know that this is an exploitation movie!! This includes animal cruelty (killings) and sexual violence. If you can't live with that (many can't), DON'T watch this movie! The movie is made to look like a documentary, and therefore everything looks more genuine. The story is (very short): What happened to some explorers who went into the jungle, and second, analyzing the film footage they made. It's following this ""horrible"" footage we will see what happened to them. Not very good things, I can tell you.As an adult, I have to admit that I actually like this, even though I could have lived without the obvious exploitation part. But, I guess, that is also what makes it so bone-chilling. ...that something has ACTUALLY been done ""inhumane"" in this movie, and not only ""film tricks"". Makes me think that; ""Am I really so immune to violence and gore"" to actually accepting to watch this? Sorry to say, Yes.If you do accept watching this type of movies, I think you will like this one.It looks ""genuine"", the directing is quite good (considering what the movies goal is), the acting is good to mediocre and the film quality is quite good (later releases).Again, if you have ANY problems with animal cruelty, don't watch this (if the movie is uncut)! And (of course), do NOT show this to young people! Even though (when I was a kid) I thought it was a ""snuff"" movie (with the following nightmares), I think it still would have made some scares to my atheist ""soul"", not knowing it to be so.This is not the worst exploitation movie made, not even close, but it is something in between. I won't name the movies that are worse... But I can say (in my opinion), that if you go further down this route (exploitation movies), the more ""hurt"" you can get (like watching the poor actors who stars in them). Then it's no longer ""acting"" at all, in my opinion.For more info about the story of this movie, read many of the other reviews here at IMDb, or search the internet.

216,Bataeu,Brilliant in every way.,10,11 June 2006,"After hearing so much about this film, I was so happy to finally get my hands of a copy of the DVD. When I got home I immediately put it in my DVD player and sat down, anticipating one hell of a ride, considering everything I'd heard about it.The movie itself is a beautifully shot piece of cinema. Never before have I seen something filmed/directed like this before. The film ran so smoothly, there was never a dull moment, and the locations were perfect. The acting was average, but still not bad enough for me to loose interest. I have to admit the scene where Faye had the spider on her shoulder seemed a bit overacted, but otherwise- as I mentioned earlier- average all around.Now onto the gore. Mainly when I watch a gory movie I just take it as it comes, knowing that the filmmakers have tossed in a gallon or two of blood for good old fashioned gory fun. With CH, the gore was more realistic because it wasn't overdone. You really believed that that's what it would look like if someone did have their leg cut off, or did have their wang cut off, or have their guts pulled out and thrown about by savages. There was no over the top bucket of blood effects, just believable amounts of blood. After all, I think Deodato wanted more to get his message across than the gore. ;) The animal killings were quite easy to sit through because- as I mentioned in another thread- you see that kind of thing all the time in documentaries on the discovery channel, granted that it's lions or tigers doing the killing. But I took it in the sense that the Deodato was trying to show that people in ""normal"" society can be as brutal as the cannibals. Meat is meat, and you kill what you need to survive. The cannibals kill humans for food just as we kill cows, chickens, or even turtles for food. Natural selection- the food chain. Only for cannibals humans are on the food chain.I quite enjoyed the way that the film took a stab at the media- exploiting people to give them a bad name or to look worse than they were, as shown in the Last Road To Hell sequence.When compared to Cannibal Ferox, Cannibal Holocaust is definitely the more intelligent of the two. Ferox was made in the hype of Holocaust's release- just as nowadays you have movies coming out in a ""genre-hype"". Although Ferox had no real grounds to be so in your face about it as Holocaust as there was no real underlying message other than, ""Here's a gory cannibal movie."" To say it any simpler, Ferox was to Holocaust as Deep Impact was to Armageddon. In a word, inferior. A director/studio trying to make money by copying someone else's success.I conclusion, Cannibal Holocaust was a highly interesting and enjoyable movie to watch, and I shall be watching it again and again, because it has a great underlying message, which is also the final line in the film.""Who are the real cannibals?""",Cannibal Holocaust
217,angrymidget19,"Mind blowing, a must see for any horror fan!",10,29 January 2007,"First off, this film is not for the faint of heart. It is absolutely brutal! It's not violent throughout though, it's definitely a horror/drama. The director, Ruggero Deodato really makes you get to know each character. None of that bullsh!t where you can't remember a character's name, and couldn't care less about what happened to them. This film really pushes it to the limit, and does a good job of it.The downside to this film is that the animal killings are 100% real, and graphic. A coatimundi (sort of like a muskrat) is killed and eaten. A turtle is pulled from the water, dismembered, disemboweled and eaten. A pig is shot in the head, and eaten. A monkey has the top of its head cut off, and a native eats the brain (Rugger Deodato wanted to use a fake monkey, but the native insisted it be real, because monkey brains are a delicacy to them). Also, a tarantula is cut in half, and a snake has its head cut off. But nobody cares about them, because they're dumb. The animal killings, however brutal they are to watch, aren't THAT bad, considering that the cast cooked and ate them afterward. It's merely food preparation in graphic detail.Overall, if you're looking for a pointless film with tons of gore and depravity, this is not for you, you'll be bored out of your skull. Go with something like Murder-Set-Pieces or August Underground/Mordum. If you want a great drama that isn't too graphic, go with something like Green Mile or The Godfather, or City of God, because this will shock the sh!t out of you. But, if you want an amazing drama that makes you feel for the characters, but also has mind blowing gore and depravity, then look no further, because this is the film for you. #8 on my top 10 of all time. #3 best horror of all time. Incredible movie.",Cannibal Holocaust
218,Jellygoose,what can i say,10,20 July 2000,"im not gonna go on and on about the blair witch similarities im not gonna go on about how this is the sickest film ever made hey guess what im not even gonna say how unnecessary the animal killings were instead im gonna tell you the way it is Personally i love this movie even though i have a hard time watching it and even though its a hard movie to watch over and over i guess its a love hate thing with this movie no middle of the road its one extreme or the other wether you feel this movie was sick enough for you or not is a matter of taste but dont degrade it as overhyped violence cos it shouldnt be judged by what you see but the ideas behind it so what if the effects arent realistic enough for you when the native is raped with the rock the idea is shocking enough for it not to have to look real to all you special fx experts so what if you didnt like the message or didnt get the message - if you were looking for it you knew it was there so whats the point its not gonna shock you. the irony of all this is that whether you loved it or hated you all felt strongly enough to comment on it in one extreme or the other in my eyes that makes this a brilliant movie, because whether you thought it was the best of its kind or the worst piece of trash ever, just try to forget it.  Thats the power of this movie and i urge everyone to see it",Cannibal Holocaust
219,conedust,Not for the Faint of Heart...,5,18 July 2015,"So, I watched Cannibal Holocaust (that title!) last night - my third viewing over 20-odd years and the first I even half enjoyed. The revelatory restoration currently available on region A Blu-Ray courtesy of Grindhouse Releasing has a lot to do with that, especially when measured against the dubiously sourced, pan-n-scan VHS that introduced me to this infamous sleaze epic way back when. Where I once saw only a turgid and poorly-framed mass of washed-out browns and yellows, I now fully understand why so many praise Cannibal Holocaust for its visual qualities. Sergio D'Offizi's lush yet gritty cinematography gives Ruggero Deodato's film a sweat- soaked, jungle-vibrant eye candy appeal that I was never before able to properly appreciate.And the gore is spectacular. Let's get that out of the way right up front, as it's undoubtedly a huge part of this film's lasting cult appeal. Even with thirty-some years of horror fandom beneath my belt, the unforgettable (and much-reproduced) image of the impaled native woman remains one of the most astonishing practical effects shots I've ever seen. It's as brilliantly simple as it is brutally effective. That said, I'll probably never become comfortable with the film's ghoulish displays of real-life animal abuse. While even its most upsetting moments do have thematic relevance in context, I'd have been far happier to go through life without ever having seen a living monkey's tiny face chopped off. In moments such as this, Grindhouse's otherwise glorious high-definition restoration is no blessing at all.Cannibal Holocaust is often celebrated for its social criticism. With all due respect to the film's many erudite admirers, I personally feel that it's too obvious and hypocritical to make a truly meaningful statement. While Deodato clearly condemns the ignorance and exploitative cruelty of the ""civilized"" interlopers who view Brazilian rainforest tribespeople and their customs as ""savage"", he milks a shockingly ignorant, flatly racist cartoon of the latter's culture for cheap shock value. And though he seems to implicate his audience's bloodlust in the carnage we witness on screen, he uses this potentially intriguing critical vantage primarily as an excuse to wallow in lurid atrocity (much like Paul Verhoeven in Robocop and Starship Trooppers). Despite all that, I'm not inclined to condemn the film or its makers. Racism aside, there's nothing so terribly wrong with the sort of cinematic hypocrisy on display. And though Cannibal Holocaust's ethical incoherence sabotages its claim to moral authority, it fuels the feral, leering intensity of a true exploitation classic.Amid the carnage, it's interesting to note the seldom-mentioned inclusion of (appparently?) real human execution footage in an early, context- & character-establishing flashback sequence. This documentary-styled section of the film seems to comment, if indirectly, on Jacopetti and Prosperi's Africa Addio and the ensuing murder trial. Perhaps one could describe Cannibal Holocaust as a ""what if?"" exercise imagining a documentary crew even more monstrously cynical than Jacopetti & Prosperi were alleged to have been by overzealous Italian prosecutors. With that in mind, there's a certain bitter irony in the fact that Deodato and his crew were themselves brought up on (and ultimately cleared of) murder charges following the release of their film. Plus ca change...What else? Wonderful music!!! I desperately want a copy of Riz Ortolani's perversely beguiling score on vinyl. And I'm glad to have finally understood - and to some extent appreciated - a celebrated/reviled horror ""masterpiece"" that long eluded me.",Cannibal Holocaust

222,blando3,I hated this movie!,1,1 June 2000,"I heard about this movie through a friend and a few of us rented it a couple of weeks ago.  The only reason we got it was because of the excessive gore it supposedly contains, and the fact that it was the film the Blair Witch Project is based on.  I hated it.  Not only was it not very graphic (I think I saw an edited down version), but it was really boring for the first 45 minutes or so, and even when the gory footage was shown, I was still bored. It was obviously fake as the camera got really shaky every time something graphic occurred so you can't tell what's happening.  The characters were completely dislikeable and deserved what they got.  The only parts that were hard to watch were the scenes of real animal torture and killing.  Don't listen to what you hear about this movie.  It's not worth it.  2/10",Cannibal Holocaust
223,friskysman,Wonderful film,8,23 November 2003,"I have never considered myself ""extremely jaded"" but I must rethink that idea after watching Cannibal Holocaust. I had read all the reviews and knew what to expect, but I was not a bit disgusted by anything I saw. At least not on a physical level. Of course, the horrible things shown in CH are disgusting on an emotional level when you consider what the filmmakers do to the natives and how they meet their grisly end. However, I was not scarred after watching it like I thought I might be. Perhaps all the research I did ahead of time helped. I don't know. But as far as disturbing movies go, I have seen much worse.That's not to say CH is a bad movie. It is not. The scenes are beautiful and the process in which the story is told is revolutionary. I suppose my only complaint with the film (other than the fact that real animals were actually killed in the making...but that's another subject for another time) is that I see no motivation for what the filmmakers did. What reasons did they have to round up an entire village into one hut and set it on fire? I can sort of understand the rape (though I don't in any way condone it) but genocide I do not.All that aside, CH does what it aims to do brilliantly. I don't think the gore is as bad as some make it out to be, but I certainly wouldn't recommend it to someone who has to close their eyes during Scream. If you can stand violence, rape, and animals being killed, this is a masterpiece of a film.",Cannibal Holocaust

Ah, if only wishes could come true.Sometimes movies are heralded as classics just because they're old. This is one of those films. It's not a classic horror like The Shining, A Clockwork Orange, The Amityville Horror, or even The Entity. It's just an old overly hyped torture porn flick. If you're into that, watch it. I watched it for free, so I'm not fussed about the hour and thirty plus minutes I lost on it.:: SPOILER ALERT ::It only starts to get disturbing or even interesting after about an hour into the movie and frankly, the most disturbing part of the film is the apparently needless slaughtering of the animals and the savage on a stick. For a low budget film those ""special effects"" looked pretty d*mn real far surpassing most present day films of the same caliber that had/heave a MUCH bigger budget. I hope they at least fed the dead animals to the villagers. Poor turtle.Didn't feel the least bit sorry for the ""environmentalists"". Their deaths were well deserved. Don't f*ck around with the tree people. Live like a savage die like a savage.Overall, the movie was MEH. I give it a six because it's fairly watchable, the effects are excellent, and it is thought provoking provided you've got more than two brain cells rubbing together.Who are the real savages?I'm going to say, the human race as a whole.",Cannibal Holocaust
225,Hector_The_Toad,Interesting and *gasp* intelligent exploitation,9,18 December 2006,"--CONTAINS SOME SPOILERS---Italian exploitation king Ruggero Deodato's genre classic CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST holds its own against defining horror pictures such as HALOWEEN, LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. While these three films conceptualised the slasher, rape and revenge and zombie picture respectively, CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST did something different - it created a trend of horrific violence in order to terrify audiences and, in this respect, Deodato's audacious picture succeeds wholeheartedly. The film's surprisingly intelligent plot is quite simple - an anthropology professor Harold Monroe(played with conviction by porn star Robert Kerman) goes on a trip to the Green Inferno - a jungle holocaust in the midst of the roughest Amazonian terrain, inhabited by warring tribes of cannibals. With his guide, Monroe sets out to investigate the fate of a group of documentarians (Jack, Faye, Mark and their leader, Yates) filming footage of such tribes. In their quest,they encounter a number of atrocities, most of which are committed by the Yamamomo's rival tribe, the Yacumo. One such set piece that remains one of the film's most enduring images of extreme violence is a ritualistic punishment of an adultress. This is one of CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST's most violent and disturbing scenes. When Monroe and his team reach the Yamomomo's, they are given Yates' team's footage. Monroe returns to the NYU with the footage and screens it. The documentary is truly vile - Yates' team are shown killing animals (real footage subject that laid the film in solid disrepute, the most controversial being the turtle scene), raping tribal women and committing a mass homicide of Yamomomo tribespeople. Finally, the Yates team receive their just desserts from the natives they tormented.CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST is an undeniably powerful film with some solid performances and great direction. The score is also a highlight, with Riz Ortolani utilising some of the skills that had nominated him for an Oscar over a decade before. CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST is undeniably intense in its violence however none of it is gratuitous - it perfectly encapsulates the atmosphere of helplessness that Deodato succeeds in conveying. The fact that the film is titled 'Cannibal Holocaust' arguably leads to its ultimate downfall: gorehounds wanting Deodato's classic slice of exploitation to live up to its title will be disappointed - cannibal action only really appears in the last fifteen minutes. Likewise, those wanting an intelligent film will overlook CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST because of its title. Overall, CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST is a solid film that has lost little of its power in some twenty-six years.",Cannibal Holocaust
226,fudgepax261,"Effective Holocaust asks ""are you good?"" **** outta ****",10,21 May 2006,"The other night I was watching a news report on real depicted violence caught on camera phones that are sent,posted and shown on the internet for laughs,a trend progressing in the U.K. where unknowing victims are slapped viciously,ultimately killing them.There is also violence for entertainment starting in Texas just like in the U.K. where willing participants are slapped,punched,and dragged across the pavement almost killing them,it is filmed and sold on the internet for $20. I believe this is what Ruggero Deodato was trying to convey in his film,""Cannibal Holocaust""for its harrowing straight forward violence and real animal slaughtering,it is a film about the nature of humanity's cruelty and how crazed we are on violence.The director and one of the film's producers were arrested and the film seized a week after the premiere,the courts in Milan believed Deodato actually had the actors in the film murdered for the camera and was tried,so Deodato took the cast members to a talk show to prove they were alive.Deodato came up with the idea after witnessing his son watching the news and they focused on the violence just as you would watch the news at night seeing people kick helpless people to death. It begins with a search for a missing documentary crew by Harold Monroe who goes to the amazon rainforest and is accompanied by Jacko and Miguel with a native they've have captured to guide them to his tribe in search for the missing crew,they witness an unbearable punishment ritual.When they get to the natives tribe they find the films footage but not the missing documentary crew,Professor Monroe goes back with the film to New York and talks to television executives,he plays the found film footage for them and for us. We see young a young group of a documentary crew Alan Yates,the director,his girlfriend Faye Daniels,two cameramen Jack Anders and Mark Tomasso being accompanied by a guide Felipe,the crew are in it for fame and fortune,they film abortion rituals and terrorize the village.On not wanting to show much of the footage Monroe talks to a female executive and talks to her what it would feel like if she were one of the tribes-people,we find out how the film crew's lives were and the people they left behind do not even care,the greedy executives insist that they show the rest of the footage and showing it off as a real documentary which angers Monroe"" You haven't seen the stuff that even your editors didn't have the stomach to put together, and if you had, you wouldn't hesitate but to agree with me!,""with resilience he shows them and us the rest of the footage and what we see is terrifying,unnerving and intense.There is a scene where one of the crew members are carried off by the angered villagers we see a terrified expression on Alan,it gives us a chill knowing what they had done was wrong. Accompanied by the celestial music of Ritz Ortolani which captures the atmosphere of ""Cannibal Holocaust""it gives us a chill while watching the demise of the film crew,there is a scene where what could be the native leader says in his language and we do not need subtitles because it is obvious what he is saying wailing and howling at Harold Monroe played elegantly by porn star Robert Kermen as a professor standing up to his principles.Alan yates played slyly by Carl Gabriel Yorke a conniving snake with a sense of greed who thought he was going to be killed after witnessing the animal slaughtering.The film may be known for its slaughtering real animals but it is not what Deodato wanted but since most of the natives were cannibals they did eat the animals including a monkey that was going to be a prop but the natives insisted a real one,by the end we hear the obvious line that we thought all along but we needed to hear it to be reminded.Ruggero Deodato made this film not to shock makes us think,what he wanted to but look away and asks""what does our society look for in violence?""",Cannibal Holocaust
227,triton_ogletree,It's just not very good...,5,13 June 2020,"This film is quite graphic and it exhibits real animals being killed, as well as scenes of rape, plenty of blood and guts and other disturbing imagery and yet, this film was able to inspire both the found footage film genre and gore flicks all while telling a cautionary, ""moral"" story. That said...I can drone on about how animals were killed to make this and how this is just an excuse to be gory and exploitive like everyone else seems to but the fact is that all that sensationalism takes a back seat anyways because, this movie just...isn't very good.The film quality is bad (as are a lot of horror flicks.) The quality is somehow beneath TCM, Night of the Living Dead and in parts, even The Blair Witch Project. The unnecessary dubbing is less like The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (which is another Italian made film) and more similar to that of Godzilla (not Gojira because that version of the film isn't dubbed.) Most of the actors and actresses are speaking English which is the film's language, rendering the dubbing useless in the end anyways. I understand that Italian films were often dubbed later but whoever did it was amazingly bad at it!The acting is atrocious! The only decent actors are a few of the victims. The musical theme, while memorable and slightly eerie, is also extremely repetitive and ultimately nothing to write home about. The effects are ok but not extremely impressive as they are just basic splatter make-up effects on a shoestring budget. In fact, most technical aspects of this film are at best, middle of the road.The message of the movie is probably its strongest aspect. It's simply telling the viewer that sensationalism (while a great selling point,) tends to be ""wrong"" and turns ""civilized"" people into monsters. It makes this message well known, all the while ironically creating a sensationalistic movie where the actual film's crew also behave in a similar (although far less dark) manner. Again, they killed real animals on set which I would say is kind of sensationalistic, wouldn't you?At the end of the day, the viewer is left with a story about a man who goes in search of a film crew and discovers that they are victims of local cannibals (if you believe this to be a spoiler, you apparently didn't consider the title to be much of one) only to consider why this would happen to ""good people"" in the first place. It sounds like it would be powerful and interesting but it just isn't that well made. The level of gore is a small achievement but is probably less impressive than Dawn of the Dead. The commentary on society is present and valid but not well delivered and as previously mentioned, it is not a particularly well made movie which ultimately results in a very mediocre film experience. Hence, you don't really need to hear about how ""gross"" this film is. All you need to know is that this movie shoots itself in the foot by becoming that which they are warning the viewer about and creating that with only mediocre skill level. If you are a gore hound/completist, I probably wasn't going to stop you from watching it anyways but if you are just randomly curious about this film, just know that it's really not worth your time.If you want gore, watch Traces of Death. If you want horror, watch The Shining. If you want a powerful message, watch The Shawshank Redemption. If you want none of the above in one package, watch Cannibal Holocaust.",Cannibal Holocaust
228,streetsofla,A Disgusting Mess,2,23 May 2001,"There are two main categories which the humble video nasty can fall into. High art, where the film uses excessive violence but in a way and for a purpose which has deeper meaning behind. These include the films `Last House on the Left', by Wes Craven and `Straw Dogs', by Sam Peckinpah. Then there's ones which simply exploit the genre, and rip off  preceding classics. Cannibal Holocaust fits into the second one, although it's initial idea seemed very promising. It's story seems very cleaver, a couple of people go off into the dense rain forests in order to make a documentary about the local cannibal tribes. They are never heard of again, and only their video tapes remain. But it's through Ruggero's messy and shock provoking direction where the basic principle gets lost, and what remains is a vial, sick inducing mess of a movie. Ruggero only wants to show the audience the most violent things possible in the hope of making them feel sick and depraved, and in that sense he succeeds with flying colours. Repeated scenes of rape, torture, murder and, by far the worse, real-life animal cruelty ensue and destroy a perfectly good concept for a film, see `Blair Witch' they did the basic idea much better. Ignore all the others on this page, this is not high art, just another exploitation movie which thinks it's saying something of importance. Go and see `Straw Dogs' or `The Last House on the Left', they explore the themes of extreme fear and the human condition much better, and leave this film well alone.",Cannibal Holocaust

233,HeroOfTheDay666,"Horrifying, Brutal, Disgusting, but Great",8,28 December 2013,"Cannibal Holocaust is a 1980 Italian horror movie directed by Ruggero Deodato which is shot in a documentary style. It sounds campy by the title, but it is anything but. It has been often titled as the most controversial movie of all time. If you measure controversy in terms of international legal action, then that might very well be a true title. If it wasn't outright banned in a country, it was almost always censored heavily due to its graphic violence, animal cruelty, and allegations of murder of some of the actors. With the murder charges dropped, only now did the original, uncut version become available for consumer viewings, and it's no surprise to those that have seen it that it still shocks and disgusts to this day.The premise is that a group of film students at NYU go to the heart of the unsettled and uncivilized South American rainforest, dubbed ""The Green Inferno"", in order to shoot a film about the natives there and their customs. They never return however, and an anthropology professor embarks on a rescue mission to discover the fates of the students. I don't think this is much of a spoiler given the title of the film, but surprise, he discovers that they were eaten. The film they shot, however, remains intact, which he takes back to New York, and is viewed by the film executives who were responsible for publishing the original film. Despite the preconceived notions the viewer probably has about the ""savages"" vs the ""civilized"" filmmakers, it becomes apparent upon watching who the real savages were. Murder and rape of the natives, along with the brutal animal slayings performed by the students with smiles on their faces, all for the sake of filmmaking, will disgust you to your core. As the professor says at the end of the film, ""I wonder who the real cannibals are.""Personally, the most fascinating aspect of the film for me is that I consider this one of the most revolting films ever made, but not because of the actual violence. Don't get me wrong, it can be bloody and horrific, but strictly speaking in terms of gore it's not bad compared to modern torture porn films. The real reason it sends shivers down your spine is because of the incredible disregard for life and a lack of basic humanity in people that surround us every day. I won't spoil these horrendous acts because honestly they need to be seen to be believed as to how terrible they are. Another reason the film is so brutal is that it never lets up and never pulls a punch. The horror is nonstop, especially during the sections set in the Green Inferno. Even the ways that the film producers shrug off much of the horrifying acts shown in the recovered footage are sickening to me.The most controversial aspect of the film is probably the genuine animal slayings portrayed on film. Even though I am a meat eater, this is where I feel the film's biggest blunder is. The point of the film is that us civilized people can be extremely savage, but actually killing animals for the sake of a movie, even one with a message such as that, is hypocritical to me. Even the director later regretted the decision to kill these animals. If you're of faint of heart, you will be horrified as to what you will see. In what is probably the most infamous scene, a large turtle is decapitated, has its exterminates cut off, and its shell torn off, followed by the removal of the entrails, all shown in graphic detail. Another scene people tend to point to is one in which a small monkey has its head chopped down the middle. To me, however, the most disturbing animal killing is one in which a coatimundi (a type of raccoon) is stabbed multiple times in the neck while it shrieks until it finally succumbs to its wounds. All the more horrifying is that the actors do these acts with smiles on their faces. I'm not sure how someone can do something like that and seem so OK with it, unless they are just as morally corrupt as the characters they portray. Despite how disgusting and sickening the film is, I still recommend it, but with caution. This film is NOT for everyone and it is likely you may be sick to your stomach. Nonetheless, it is well acted, well shot, and well executed, animal killings aside. The political message behind it is refreshing, even though it will make you depressed and degrade your hope for humanity. You can find the original uncut version on YouTube, but know what you're getting into.",Cannibal Holocaust

In spite of its hypocritical production (again, I'm not getting into it) the basic idea is about sensationalism and how the media chooses to spin things, so to be completely fair it is pretty clever......at first. Like I said, this movie is very disturbing and veeeeery uncomfortable. It is admittedly very well acted, though inevitably some of the ADR is kinda flaky, the idea is quite clever and I hate to admit it but it's directed and shot very well, especially by 70's/80's exploitation standards, but none of this justifies anything that happens on screen.

The acting wasn't brilliant but the characters came across very well.The cinematography and editing were both top notch, much better than expected for such a gory movie.I found the music a little annoying,I'm sure it would go down better in the '80s, but does seem dated now.I did find i had to look away at times during the animal killings,i didn't find the turtle scene as shocking as i found the cries of the little rat thing they kill very early in the film,i didn't watch any of that scene, the sounds of the poor little critter was more than enough to send a shiver up my spine! So if you are a animal lover like me just get the version sans the animal killings, i knew i wasn't going to like them but like them or not, they are part of the power of this film.I don't think i have seen anything that really freaked me as much as this movie, yes i frequent such wholesome places as rotten,ogrish etc and have also seen the faces of death series, paramedics etc and yet none of the real images/movies i have seen have the power of this film.This really is one shocking powerful film,not for the faint hearted, but if you think you can handle it, grab the DVD now.",Cannibal Holocaust
236,kleinjeremy,Very split on this one.,5,7 November 2019,"This is a good film made by a pretty shoddy director who made some bad choices that really muddy up the film somewhat.The discussion of the intersection of civilization and civility is actually pretty powerful, but the animal cruelty is unnecessary, not scary, and just flat out gross. Clearly, as many people know, the director wanted to make this film as realistic as possible so people would think it was real. The problem, though, is that this didn't work out, the director was arrested (and understandably so), and now everyone knows the film is fictional... with the exception of the animal killings, which aren't frightening, but gross and unethical. Some people say it's no different from the meat industry, and you'd be correct, but if you want to watch a film about that, go watch a vegan documentary.Still, for some people, I think the film might be worth a watch. It's not a bad film overall. I would try to find a version without the animal deaths, though. The soundtrack of the film is very good, the special effects are great (notwithstanding the real animals), the acting is good at its peak and charmingly cheesy at its trough, and I actually like the film. I don't like the director, though.",Cannibal Holocaust

Ive seen all the Traces of death, the men behind the sun films, and the Guinea pigs and I still think this is king.  It is simply so well made, acted, atmospheric and the brilliant score by Riz Ortalani sets the scene so well. The fake documentary style never slips up.

Actually i don't think i would be able to take it in a movie theater. But in the comfort of the home, this is a guilty pleasure. Deodato managed so well with his camera. Camera is actually the ""hero"" here. The camera films everything, including death of poor animals. Cannibal Holocaust will stay in memory because it got it all as Grindhouse DVD says. Well i was lucky enough to get the EC DVD (uncut), brilliant printing, and above all, the sound is nearly perfect. Cannibal Holocaust wont be the same without such a brilliant score !

241,vishvakarman,This movie is intense. It's shocking. It has a message.,9,25 May 2004,"The message of Cannibal Holocaust' is: While human society has advanced tremendously in their technology over the past 5000-10000 years, modern man has become alienated from life itself. Behind the veil of modern technology and (political) philosophy lies a pervert, not a savage. The killings and atrocities of the Westerners are erratic and sadistic, while the punishments of the Natives follow ritualistic patterns related to their lives as a group and the groups' struggle for survival. In other words: the murders committed by the Westerners are unnecessary, while the ones committed by the Natives are not. The native brutality and cannibalism are part of ritual, i.e. they serve a distinct function. The brutality of the Westerners imitates those of the Natives without understanding the ritualistic function. The savage breaks loose, but it is a perverted savage who does not understand what he is doing.In terms of this message, Cannibal Holocaust' does a better job than Apocalypse Now' or other movies that deal with related topics. I wonder however how Ruggero Deodato shot this film: the Natives don't look like they are actors at all, but like real Natives who really don't know what a camera is. That makes the movie very realistic and shockingly disturbing.
Highly Recommended Viewing.8/10.",Cannibal Holocaust
242,ultrasween,Cannibal Holocaust,1,19 June 2018,"This film only warrants to be used as toilet paper during The Day After (1983) (TV). From the real killings of a turtle to that of a spider monkey, this film is about an NYU professor who goes to South America to salvage the film recordings and find the crew who were sent to investigate a cannibalistic tribe. Soon he returns to New York to view the tapes with his peers. They discover the crew's heinous intent in South America - which seems to be bent on destruction and violence along with the poor portrayal of the native tribes. Filled with offensive and graphic scenes such as rape, murder and the killing of numerous live animals, the story speaks on a very shallow level about violence in the media. The footage from the crew is filmed in a very gritty cinema verité documentary style, somewhat convincing the viewer that what they are seeing is in fact real. Although this is somewhat intriguing, the film fails to produce anything but a ultra-violent pseudo-snuff film which makes you want to get into a Delorean, kick in up to 88 and drive into a brick wall. This review is a warning: DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM! Not even for those with a strong stomach. The crew's footage will most likely shock and disgust you, and not in a good way. No wonder the director spent some time in jail due to this - above all else - loathesome piece of celluloid. S",Cannibal Holocaust
243,Prince_of_Darknet,ESSENTIAL FOR GORE FANS,8,12 March 2003,"Cannibal Holocaust is the prototype for Blair Witch. Shockingly realistic and unsettling, it's light on plot but heavy on shock value. Basically the same plot as BWP, a documentary crew of 3 young people travel into the Amazon jungle to research a film crew who previously disappeared. They encounter among other things, a girl being raped (which they dutifully film). The 3 main characters are unlikeable from the start, bickering, lewd, crude and annoying. It's hard to feel sorry for them when they are finally dispatched by a tribe of hungry cannibals. The visuals of bodies being torn apart are incredibly realistic, you have to remind yourself it isn't real. Recommended for gore-hounds and lovers of cannibal/jungle flicks!",Cannibal Holocaust
244,Lovechild_77,"Pretty OK horror/shock/mockumentary, but overrated.",5,4 November 2005,"Actually I thought that this movie should be a little bit more shocking. I presume that I saw the UK cut version since it wasn't especially offending (not for me at least), and there were signs of sloppy editing and music where they did the cuts. This was obvious in the tortoise scene because they only dragged the poor fellow up from the water and then the girl puked and then they ate. Hmm..Well, I think I'm glad I missed out on that because I really hate animal cruelty, but from what I've heard the animal slaughter scenes were made in hunter tradition so I guess they could be left alone.Now about the story, the movie is pretty exciting although the first half hours was a little bit slow. And these ""photographers"", well they surely should die I think. What arrogant, evil bastards they were.I don't really understand a few thinks about this movie. The professor and the other two guys in the beginning was rather sympathetic, but this gang of cruel photographer-rapists was rather strange. I mean, first they walk through the jungle, behaving like a bunch of teenagers with a camera, and then when they finally reaches this isolated village with it's primitive cannibal tribe they start to suddenly behave like insane. Where did this suddenly insanity came from? We never know I guess. It looks like this was only an excuse to make the viewer hate this documentary crew. What was the meaning of burning down the cannibal's house? Was it to get some respect or just to create some shocking pictures of documents to show when they returned back home? I dunno, but they certainly were mean, cruel and stupid and they certainly deserved to die.I think the best part in the whole movie is when the bitch gets it, this photographer whore. That was a pleasant view, to see her being ripped to pieces. (And she had ugly tits too).My final verdict:The picture: 8, this was a fine print, bright and sharpThe Music: 6, it pales in comparison to Antropohagus for exampleActing & Characters: 7, the acting is good, no b-movie feelingExcitement: 5, it's always more exciting to see the unseen thenactually seeing it, when you've seen cannibals eating""human flesh"" it's not exciting anymore.

245,rbjr330,Cannibal Holocaust is a masterpiece,9,20 January 2005,"*** May contain some spoilers *** I am a huge fan of the Italian horror sub-genre of the 70's and 80's and Cannibal Holocaust is one of the best film's to come from that. It is known as the most controversial film of all time and is highly dissed by many for it's disturbing gore, real animal violence, and graphic sexual violence. But this film is one of my favorite horror films ever. Not only because of it's unflinching realism, but also it's stunning direction, good story, and one of the best scores i've ever heard. The film starts of pretty good with Robert Kerman traveling to the jungle in search of a missing documentary team. There he discovers a tribe of cannibals, who have the documentary teams missing footage, which is right with the teams remains! He manages to leave with the footage, which he brings back to New York, and that is when the real show starts. We get to watch the team's footage and see how they met their deaths at the hands of the cannibals. Definitely a shocking film, not for the squeamish or any animal activists. Great movie, I give it a 9/10. The only reason i don't give it a 10/10 is because you can't recommend it to people(at least not normal people).

Geek show violence coupled with an infuriatingly half baked sense of self righteousness. The film lingers on acts of violence and cruelty and then has the nerve to step back and try to tack on morals and social commentary, so not only is the film reprehensible, it is also extremely hypocritical. A truly thought provoking film could have been made with similarly taboo subject matter. Apocalypse Now and Aguire, the Wrath of God spring to mind. Both of those films featured shocking acts of violence and real animal killings, but they had a purpose other than simply shocking the viewer. They had moments of true beauty and introspection, great acting and cinematography, and they didn't exploit their subject matter and then add some phony morals to make it all okay.",Cannibal Holocaust

Sure, I'd been at parts of my life a vegetarian but I've jumped off of that train again and it seemed to me that the animals, especially the tortoise, were dispatched fairly quickly. Granted, what they did to the turtle was pretty gross but by that point it had been long dead and I'm sure that equally disgusting stuff going on in the neighborhood slaughterhouse.The story itself is fairly simply but thought provoking, and while I'm sure that most people will be entirely put off by the on screen slaughter, those that demand more from their films will probably enjoy the subtle (?) message and come-uppance that the main characters get.",Cannibal Holocaust

""the green inferno"" to shoot a documentary about the native ""cannibal"" tribes. After a short period of shooting they discover that the footage they have shot so far is not spectacular enough so they decide to stage the whole thing. Their misbehavior is put at an end when they come across one of the ""real"" cannibal tribes of the region. When the home front discovers that the crew shows no sign of life they decide to send out a rescue mission. These people (an anthropologist and his guides) retrieve the original footage that the missing crew has shot and they bring it back to the US...I decided to wait for the uncut European version of the film because i am not a fan of censorship (each individual should be able to decide for himself what he wants or doesn't want to see) but this can ONLY be the case with FICTION. This film however contains actual footage of animal killings (a snake is beheaded, a spider is squashed, a monkey is scalped, a turtle is beheaded and after-wards eaten, a pig is shot in the head,...)and this is not the essence of a horror film. Horror movies are supposed to be fictional stories with great special effects and effective story lines that entertain or scare you with their originality. Movies like this one give the horror scene a bad name and why...? This film is ""famous"" for it's ""great"" special effects; the special effects in this movie are so bad that every scene that contains one of these ""so called"" effects is shot out of focus (the filmmakers get away with it because they can use the excuse that it has been shot using small portable cameras). The only times the gore is convincing is when they use actual guts from real animals and make it look like it came from a human body. The story line of the movie is completely unbelievable (with footage of rape and torture that are just thrown in without adding any originality whatsoever- the mere reason they put this in is to ""shock"" the viewer even more/ they didn't succeed), the make-up effects are weak (just some guys painted white and wearing wigs made out of straw) and the acting is probably the worst acting in the entire history of cinema. The only positive thing i can say about this movie is that it contains some great images of the untouched fauna and flora of the rain forest. This is however not the reason why i have bought this film. It is said that Deodato regrets that he has made this film and he should be; it is a total waste of time and money.",Cannibal Holocaust

After having exhausted pretty much every 80's American horror film 2 years ago, I switched my attention to the Italians who seem to have more imagination if not less money or acting talent. Yet they seem to do a whole hell of a lot more with it. Nudity is very plentiful all the same.

I've never seen an animal killed for real in a movie aside from documentaries, and this IS NOT a documentary. They chopped, shot, and slaughtered live animals just for this movie, and that is ballsy to say the least. Which may be the reason it was banned in so many countries, though, it could've been the violent rape scenes, or that really real looking girl skewed on the pike.The story is actually really ingenious...documentary filmmakers who take great advantage, in every way, to make their film dramatic and meaningful, even while they are the ones raping the natives, and burning the village. Just to make the God-almighty dollar. It's all in the editing, is it not? Still, the effects were amazing for the time, and I'm still not sure they were all effects!

The journey of who the real Cannibals are, makes you consider the definition of Cannibal once more. Considering how Cannibals can be hungry enough even for another human being to be degraded and belittled of a stone-age culture. With those film cameras in grip like a pistol, it adds more the journey of these ""lost Americans"" and their intentions of recording footage as a trophy and eradication more than an observation of stone-age cultures.Clearly this was a big deal in 1980 for how realistic it looks and even makes CGI in today's technological standards look like a couple of steps behind! But once you've seen it again it is obvious with the practical effects and if you research the controversy that surrounded this film. They literally had to take this film to court! Blair Witch Project was good, but jittery and shaky if the lack of dialogue makes you impatient.

One asks why, because the movie neither has good actors, good cinematography, good music or anything else then the usual cheesy bull that comes with horror flicks of this caliber. As it seems, some people are wetting themselves because some animals get killed along the way  and slap around other people for not being amused by this, as it is the ""human way"" and ""controversal"" and stuff. Surely the natives like a good snack of monkey-brain, but I'll bet they don't usually slaughter turtles and then mash around their bowels like they were Play-doh!? As natives go, I think they just eat them without much interplay  but, hey, that would not be as ""shocking"" as it is, no?Anyways, as the director had only so much money, and thus the ""special effects"" look like stolen from any run-down ghost train, killing some animals were apparently the only gore effects he would get. Also, with all the ""social criticism"" going on one begins to wonder (when not beginning to nap) what a false picture most people have from war correspondents and the like: Dang! So you have to rape, pillage, slaughter and overall behave like a complete bastard to get your pictures sold and maybe a Pulitzer Prize from time to time. No wonder the ""white men"" from the west have such a bad reputation amongst all these stupid indigenous people.And what did the Yanomamö think about these white guys who were doing a ""movie"" and wanted them to act this way and that? Good we stayed in the jungle? What the dang? Are all white men totally insane and perverted? But, back to the one thing that makes Cannibal Holocaust a movie to remember: The ""message paradox"". As many stated on this site, the movie has a message about how evil, corrupted and perverted humans are, and how all the worst human characteristics come out just to get a higher audience rate. Now this struck me as something strange. A movie who ""criticises"" the outrageous depravation of humanity  and only ever got heaved beyond the cesspit of abysmal horror flicks because it does the very same! Without all the senseless slaughtering of animals this so-called movie would rot away in the deepest corners of movie-making (and rightly so).The question is: had Ruggero Deodato this in mind when making this crap-fest?

This is a group of three men and one woman, who seem to be pretty decent people. A professor sets out with two other people to retrieve the lost film. On the exploration, the professor finds the skulls and leftover possessions of the documenting group. At this point you are most likely sad to see that everyone in the group is dead.Fast forward to where the professor is actually viewing the footage of documenting group. You will see that same group terrorizing, killing, and raping members of the tribe they set out to document. After some time they are a captured and met with the same fate that they inflicted on the tribe. And it is at that point that you realize that you should not feel sympathy or empathy for that crew.I like that it is sort of a backwards tale.

Strange, some horror films I proudly talk about and say it's the best, but Cannibal Holocaust is so shocking and disturbing, it's painful to actually rate something that is shocking, but as the film had a morality about who really are the Cannibals, it's us for wanting to see such gory stories and images, that morality to the story alone makes the film so much better and the best.

And forget the Blair Witch comparisons, I mean, the flicks are 20 years apart, with one medium similarity, BIG DEAL.",Cannibal Holocaust
262,FunkyDan,"Somewhat disappointing, but good none the less",6,27 October 2008,"First and foremost, because it's going to be talked about, whether I want it to or not, the animal killings. It's not that I have a problem with this, but I feel too big of a deal were made about them. I'd have to say, the animal killings seemed to take up about three minutes in all, most of which goes to the turtle scene. I'm not complaining, but people should just shut up about them, especially when the likes of Cannibal Ferox and Mountian of the Cannibal God have worse. Anyway...After three years of waiting, with great anticipation, to see what I believed to be the potential Holy Grail of horror films, I finally got around to watching this. And I must say, I'm somewhat disappointed, which pains me to say in ways you couldn't imagine.First off, while I knew beforehand that this wouldn't be incredibly gory, I most certainly expected much more gore and cannibalism. That is my favorite aspect of cannibal films: The gore. Now, while many say this is made up by how disturbing it is, I feel it fell just short of the mark here too, partly due to the aforementioned aspect. Which subject matter like this, it's necessary in my eyes to go a little further. Furthermore, if the film crew wanted to be gruesome and sensational, then they should'nt gotten a cameraman who likes to furiously masturbate while filming stuff(it's the only explanation I can come up with regarding the poor camera work of earlier bits of footage). I also feel like the film wallowed in its message a little too much. And lastly, the film put a bit too much emphasis on those rape scenes.As for good things: The score. Riz Ortolani is my favorite film composer, and I make a point to see the films he worked on(big mondo fan here, by the way). I've loved it ever since I first heard it, and it's even better when watching the film.The acting. The people who play Alan, Monroe, Faye, and Jack are all quite excellent(everyone else has too small of a part to mention). Alan Yates is perhaps the best movie villain ever put on screen, and it shows. Faye comes off as rather natural too.Special effects. Though, as I stated before, there isn't that much gore here, what gore there is is incredibly realistic. These make the final moments(my favorite part of the film) so great. The use of real pig organs was ingenious, and the leg amputation was one of the best partial dismemberment scenes I've ever seen. While on the subject of harrowing parts of the film, I also really dug the hut burning sequence. Now THAT was disturbing. If there was more of that sort of thing, this film would've been great.All in all, it gets a 6/10.",Cannibal Holocaust
263,Chipsmannen,Yeah I get it.... Pure F****** violence. Good? No...,7,16 February 2009,"When I first heard of the movie Cannibal Holocaust I though it was just another stupid disaster movie. Later on I suddenly heard good stuff about it (Friends, IMDb.com etc).A guy told me that he cried of this movie because of it's grotesque violence and animal cruelty and another guy told me this movie stank and he said it was horrible and rash and he wish that he never saw it. It thought: Wow! This movie is worth risking your life for! I though of this as the real version of La Fin Absolude Du monde from Cigarette Burns.In the beginning of the movie I got this good mood and the thoughts of this movie turning out to be a masterpiece of the 70's. Later on when I had spent time watching raping of women, molesting of people, animals getting molested, and not to forget the poor little pig getting kicked at and shot made me cry. It was just a total failure. The movie just wanted me too feel bad and sick I guess.I'm giving it 4 out of 10 because it only made me realize that I should treasure the good things in this world.",Cannibal Holocaust

That's the basis for this hard core gore film, apparently all the scenes in which animals are killed were real, and the human murders were pretty damn realistic too. however, after viewing, a turtle getting beheaded and gutted, a young pregnant native getting the fetus ripped out then bashed on the head with a rock, a women being raped with a rock, a young female native being raped by Americans and then seeing what they did to her afterward, impaling her on a spike through the back of her head coming out of her mouth. i'm extremely glad for what happened to those arrogant Americans but i have come to a conclusion, this is just an excuse for extreme gore...the story is irrelevant...one more thing i have been thinking is who is this film marketed to? not a lot of people",Cannibal Holocaust

270,LatinoNoir,"Not a good film...disturbing for the wrong reasons, not as gory as people have made out",5,15 March 2003,"Now, considering myself a serious film buff, I make it a point to not limit myself from any genre of filmmaking. Also being that I'm an aspiring film maker, I tend to push the envelope as far as I can, content-wise and I'm always fascinated to see how far other directors have gone in their films. Of course, this ""cannibal"" film had me interested not only because of its notorious publicity as a serious ""gorehound"" movie and as ""the most violent movie ever made"" but also because it was supposed to have an engrossing morality story to it. So, I rented it and while I realized the influence it had on the overrated yet effective film ""The Blair Witch Project"" that was the only noteworthy aspect of it. The REAL animal killings, as mentioned by many here, were completely unnecessary and only served to disgust the viewer. Now, I have an ULTRA strong stomach, so I wasn't shocked by it, just angry that a filmmaker would stoop so low as to purposely kill a form of life just to hammer home the point that ""advanced"" society can produce people who are no more moral and civilized than the cannibal tribe we are introduced to in the story.  There are ways to do things.  The animal scenes just brought about a double-standard and a sign of hypocrisy from the filmmaker.  Of course, I would have had no problems if those scenes were staged, and if Deodato actually delivered on other gore scenes concerning ""cannibalism"" and human killings (obviously, those would have to be fake as well).  However, the film wasn't nearly as gory as others made it out to be as a lot of violent acts occured offscreen.  It was mostly sleazy, especially with all the nudity. The rape scene by the male reporters was realistically disturbing, but not convincing in its motivation. Worst of all though, it's ""moral"" message was delivered unintelligently and I wasn't compelled by the story at all. It didn't help matters that the acting was atrocious and that the dubbing was awful. The cinematography was simplistic, although that was the intention to capture the feeling of a documentary. What I got was a trashy, brutally awful film to sit through, without any redeeming or thought-provoking story behind it. Sure, I've seen plenty of graphic movies that actually entertained me, but that wasn't the intention for this film.  I wasn't expecting to be entertained by the movie, but I was expecting its so-called ""important"" message to be convincingly portrayed. Still, I recommend people to watch...especially film students.  Maybe they'll get something out of it, definitely not enjoyment.",Cannibal Holocaust
271,nigel_essex,Grotesque and shocking but not for the reasons you might think.,7,29 January 2021,"Cannibal Holocaust, tacky title but not as tacky as it first appears. This is a competent well made film with a lot to say and some new ways to tell a story.
Basically it's a film of two halves a) anthropologist seeks out a lost documentary crew and b) we find out what happened to them through the footage shot by the documentarians.
So it's an early 'found footage' film and you can see the proto reality the actors and director wanted to achieve. In this day when everything is reality (even though it's not) it's amazing to think how shocking this must have been back in the day. Now we have the comfort of viewing such material and saying, ""fake"", seeing the developmental special effects of the time (with Walking Dead jaded eyes) and saying, ""seen better"". But this looked real in 1980. Hence the controversy. Yes and no.
What is really shocking is the degree of sexual violence in this film. Rape and genital mutilation are rife and this makes for uncomfortable viewing. I suppose this is a metaphor for the West's rape of nature and the destruction of virgin rainforest. It's overdone and unnecessary. I can imagine the writer explaining this to the producers who went, ""gee, we can up the nudity and throw in some rape scenes"" while perhaps another said, ""yeah, I like mud wrestling, can we put that in too? "". I seems they missed the point.
Further to this is the film's treatment of animals. Various unfortunate creatures are dispatched live on camera. OK, death happens in the real world all the time but I don't want to have it as an entertainment. Unfortunately, the cannibal genre seems to portray this a lot. I suppose it reflects the savagery of nature but animal snuff footage is wrong.
So two big negatives to this film. But taking those aside the film works as an 'man against nature' adventure, an Emerald Forest or The Revenant in its way. Its message is clear (although one feels as if one is sitting next to the director shouting it through a megaphone) the civilization of the West is far from civil.",Cannibal Holocaust
272,nevsky41,"Trite, badly mad movie infatuated with it's own pompous sense of self-righteousness",1,30 October 2004,"This is a bad movie. DO NOT believe anyone who claims any of the following:""The gore effects are so realistic!"" ""This movie has a powerful message!"" ""The music in this movie is so haunting, it's amazing!"" ""The acting is so excellent!""This movie falls apart under the weight of its own pompousness. Filled with an annoyingly high sense of self-importance and self-righteousness, the entire movie plays out like some twisted morality play that takes itself far too seriously. The acting is pretty terrible from start to finish, particularly the doomed film crew. (Yes, I know that Italian films are filmed without sound and dubbed in post. It doesn't matter. I've seen many Italian films using that method that featured excellent performances. There is not one performance in this movie that comes anywhere near acceptable, much less decent.) The performances are so bad, that I couldn't even be compelled to dislike the film crew. I just didn't care. The music is annoying Phil Glass-type garbage, and it sounds like two pieces were written, and Deodato alternates between the two. Anyway, the same music is featured over and over again, with no variation, another element inspiring apathy. It's one thing to have a theme that plays throughout a film's score, but to use the same piece of music ad nauseum is another completely. The music becomes gratingly annoying by the end of the film, and when the movie ends, the end of that awful music is just one reason you are glad the movie is over.Apparently, I'm the only person to ever see this movie and think the gore effects are incredibly unconvincing. The gore effects fooled me never for a second, nor did they even inspire me to suspend disbelief or become squeamish (like the eye-squishing from Kill Bill 2). As for the animal slaughterings, I'm no member of PETA, but these are completely unnecessary. The muskrat killing is particularly hateful, purposely drawn out for no other reason than for shock purposes. Perhaps Deodato was sending a subliminal message about how watching this movie will make you suffer like this unlucky muskrat.In the end, after watching this movie, the only reaction I experienced was that this movie was two hours of my life that I will never get back.",Cannibal Holocaust
273,maxwellbruhn1992,The Most Interesting Film I Have Yet Seen...,10,10 November 2012,"This film, while somewhat over the top and overly gritty and violent, DOES make you think at the end of the day... ""Who are the REAL savages?"" A question posed by the main character towards the end of this film.. now I did have a FEW problems with this film...PROBLEMS: Okay so the movie was great but way too nasty and violent (and I saw the U.S. Edit!) here are some examples. The rape scene (which leads to the raped girl being murdered by her people and hung from a stick, from her anus to her mouth), the birth scene (baby is born then buried alive in thick sludge and left to suffocate.. then the mother is killed), the castration scene (self explanatory) BUT!!!: While all these scenes were hard to watch (just a little hard to watch, not as graphic as you would think.. or maybe thats because I saw the US Edit).. while these scenes are graphic, they are amazingly well shot, and in a morbid and odd way, beautiful. I'm NOT crazy, and I hate violence, I simply am saying for a film done in 1980 the effects are BEYOND the effects of many of today's films, hands down.As far as the animal killing scenes ( done with real animals, I do NOT approve =,( ) but as far as they go, they are cut from the US Edit, so watch that version to be safe.. Although in the US version, it is not shown, like the sea turtle is not shown being killed, but is shown being eaten.. and the pig is not shown being killed OR eaten, so yeah..IF you watch this movie PLEASE remember it is just a film. Just a movie. This is the first movie ever where I can accept and appreciate the directors vision and see the art side of it. SO remember its JUST a movie, and TRY to APPRECIATE it not for violence, killings, castration, mutilations, or anything of that sort, but try to appreciate the moral question, and art-drenched shots in this film Thank you for reading my review",Cannibal Holocaust
274,blayzer_trayl,Remarkable. What a film!!!,10,2 December 2004,"I cant believe some people have scathed this great film. It deserves a lot higher rating.I got this movie out thinking it was going to be a brainless splatter fest. But after watching it in completion I was bowled over ..I wasn't expecting to be challenged by its visuals as well as with the sociological lessons and questions it raised.The film is real, genuine and honest to the subject topic: 'Barbarity' can be innate in all humans.It can be argued that humans coming into the homo-sapiens stage of evolution survived and expanded because of what is now considered barbarous savage ways. Savagery was a survival tool. We came from barbarity...and to an extent we still are savages.Though the acting is poor in most places ...the film director portrays cannabilism and barbarism ...and portrays it rather intelligently.Obvious connotations can be made to Blair Witch Project. I'm sure the crew that made BWP was inspired by this movie.The film follows a Professor investigating the disappearance of an American film team (3 guys and girl) that went into the jungle of South America to film a documentary about the native cannibals.The Professor with a couple of jungle assistants venture into the jungle to trace the lost Americans footsteps. He manages to get on the trail and slowly uncovers the grizzly ways of the jungle tribes! By carefully befriending these natives he captures the lost film reels and returns back to his skyscraper clad conurbation.In amongst the film there is the media business cogs turning. The dilemma of TV executives battling with the Professor to air the once lost footage on TV for the viewing public. The professor is reluctant.The professor seems the only person possessed with moral understanding and compassion throughout the film ..everyone else it seems is after ratings, fame, money or blood.The film commences its ending by playing back the raw footage of what the expedition team filmed...and it is shocking. Questions arise: Who is committing the real 'evil' savagery here?As for the animal cruelty scenes: Yes they are real and shocking. But should it be anymore shocking than the beef burger that is served up in McDonalds. Cows are slaughtered everyday. Perhaps one needs to watch a bovine neck getting slit before they take it for granted they are eating a nice juicy steak on their plate. The film portrays the reality of human meat consumption...and yes all kinds of animals are killed for the human appetite, especially in the wild - someone will do it! For those who dispute this film on these grounds 'Can you handle life?' This stuff still goes on regardless of whether u see it happen or not.This film is absolutely brilliant. A cult classic. I can see it making a revival...but don't know when...perhaps in some years time.",Cannibal Holocaust

But it is a film everyone should consider watching. It's very graphic and raw and well made, that's what makes it so good at delivering its message.The film ends with a question, ""Who the real cannibals are?""
I think it's referring to cannibalism as a way to take something from someone for your own benefit or amusement.
It can be literally eating people, causing harm and suffering to get good footage or using that footage despite it's moral contradictions.It's a film about journalistic integrity, difference between civilizations and similarities in the nature of man.",Cannibal Holocaust
276,HorrorFan265,Not my favorite in the cannibal genre but definitely something to remember,10,30 January 2019,Cannibal holocaust made in 1980 is considered to be the most controversial movie ever made. One of the many italian cannibal films of the time the story is about a professor searching for a missing documentary crew when he finds the footage and brings it home he realizes how the film crew really acted. After the film was released the director (Ruggero Deodato) was arrested on obscenity and murder charges but prooved he didn't kill his actors. Overall the film is entertaining and enjoyable but may be hard to watch it has many scenes that are very graphic. Including scenes of real animals being killed. But one scene stands out from the rest and that would be the ritualistic punishment scene it's so hard to watch and so graphic. The score for the film is great from the main theme to savage rite it's definitely one to save on spotify. I do perfer man from deep river and cannibal ferox over this though.,Cannibal Holocaust
277,ethanmitchell-76313,A Truly Powerful Film,10,29 March 2018,"There isn't much that can be said that hasn't been said before, but I will reiterate on why Cannibal Holocaust is one of the greatest pieces of cinema of all time, not only in terms of exploitation or horror, but generally one of the greatest movies ever to be made. Before we get started for those who do not know, this movie is extreme, brutally violent, depraved, and vicious, it is not for the faint of heart. But for those who do stomach it they are in for one hell of a ride.The plot seems so similar to other cannibal movies, which in 1980 was still a young subgenre and had yet to be given any praise outside of extreme cinema fans or thrill seekers, but this film holds much more in its heart than to purely shock crowds, it has deeper commentary than can meet the eye. Cannibal Holocaust tells the story of a professor and his rescue team whom travel to the heart of the Green Inferno in hopes of finding a film crew who has been missing for several months, they had been shooting a documentary on the monstrosity of the cannibalistic tribes that reside there, but soon we will see who the monsters really are.I want to keep this a spoiler free review, so I won't go into great detail on many of the scenes, just the ones that everyone already knows. We will start with the gore, I am a gore hound and I love gory movies. The effects in this movie are done mostly in a found footage type of way (the first of its kind) and it really adds a charm to the scenes, it makes you feel like you are watching a real snuff film which was obviously the point seeing that people thought the director Ruggero Deodato really had his actors murdered, he had them sign contracts to not make any appearances at any of the screenings, Deodato really went the extra mile on making us feel like we just watched a brutal massacre. There are of course the typical cannibal movie tropes that seems to happen in almost all them, a beheading, penis sliced off, etc., but in this film it feels different, other movies like Cannibal Ferox (which I also enjoy), would go on to copy almost all of these scenes repeatedly. With that there are some effects that are much different, one for instance the impaling sequence, it is so realistic that Deodato had to prove how he performed the scene in court. Though in today's world some very desensitized minds wouldn't bat an eye to the atrocities that take place throughout the course of the movie, but in 1980 it was unparalleled in its brutality. Most people still feel that this movie is reprehensible and disgusting due to the gore, but that's the fun of watching a movie like this, just to see if you can make it through.All the gore effects weren't faked in this movie though, and some on screen lives did meet their demise. If you don't know what I'm talking about and you are an animal activist than this next paragraph and this movie as a whole isn't for you. Cannibal Holocaust shows some very intense on screen animal executions, from quick killings of monkeys, and pigs to one extremely hard to watch scene where a turtle is killed, cracked open, and decapitated. For me personally these are the most hard to watch scenes in the movie, even though I will say I am not offended by them like many people are. I think they are necessary actually to truly put you in the mood the Deodato was going for, it just makes your heart hurt and that's what this movie should do! The killings are there to make you feel bad, and that's exactly what they do, they're present to show us how civilized and sheltered we are from our true animal nature and our place in the food chain. To us these animal scenes are evil and terrible, but to the tribes it's a part of everyday life and not a big deal at all, if your average person today went to a farm they would be just as upset over what they see there if not more so than what's shown in the movie, and that's why I'm not offended by what's portrayed. Other cannibal films would follow directly in the footsteps of Cannibal Holocaust and kill plenty of animals along the way, the problem with those is the killings seem to be there purely for shock factor, where as in Cannibal Holocaust I find them to be essential for portraying the theme on today's society.Some of the hardest scenes to watch for a lot of people are the ones filled with sexual violence. Long shots of people being raped, and large objects being forcefully shoved inside of women. It is pretty intense and I think much more exposing than that of other films with similar content, like Last House on the Left or I Spit on Your Grave. The big difference between those 2 movies and Cannibal Holocaust is that the female getting raped gets avenged, or gets her revenge, in Holocaust though, we see none of that, you are assaulted and essentially left for dead. I don't feel I need to explain the social commentary that's being portrayed here and how unfortunately relevant it still is today. As I said earlier, mankind has become sheltered, and even still sexual violence seems unavoidable and this movie shows how quick someone will take advantage of others less fortunate. It's safe to say things haven't changed much.I think when compared to other movies of its kind that came out of Italy, Cannibal Holocaust has some of the best writing and editing ever. There are times when the acting suffers, but in most of those moments it's because the actors in the movie are acting as bad actors. I understand that sentence may not make any sense what so ever, I will explain, after we see some characters in the film do terrible things for no reason, we then see them act on camera that they did nothing wrong. You will just have to watch it to really understand. Also the score of this movie, it's downright amazing. I have an issue with Italian Horror movie scores, I usually find them to be oddly placed compared to the theme and pace of the movie, but in Cannibal Holocaust it is spot on and helps build off of what we are seeing on the screen tremendously. Cannibal Holocaust is one of the most powerful films I have ever watched and in a painful way I enjoyed every second of it. It definitely ranks as one of the most influential horror films of all time, it inspired the likes of Eli Roth and many others, and changed the face of what we looked at as exploitative and violent. This movie should make you look at yourself and question humanity and morality. Cannibal Holocaust has stirred more controversy than arguably any other movie ever has and that is an achievement in its own right, considering we are still trying to top it today. I recommend Cannibal Holocaust to anyone who wants a powerful watch and isn't squeamish, anyone who considers themselves a film buff, and most of all any and all extreme horror fans. Cannibal Holocaust ranks in my top 10 films of all time, without a doubt.",Cannibal Holocaust
278,Udo,Best of its kind...,10,28 September 1999,"Forget all the hype, forget any kind of ""message"" Deodato tries for, and forget the bannings. What we have here is a one of a kind movie experience. I love the jungle/cannibal genre of the seventies and early eighties. Cannibal Ferox, Eaten Alive, and Jungle Holocaust are all entertaining, but you can't take them seriously. Cannibal Holocaust gives you no choice but to take it serious! The violence is brutal and real, but it doesn't come across as crass or sensationalized. It's almost like being desensitized to violence in war. Bottom line is, if you like extreme horror or Italian exploitation films, you'll love it. Don't approach it as a morality movie and don't approach it as a dare, based on its reputation.

I mean, I refuse to give any film a 10, because I would never be able to give anything a higher score, and I want to wait for that one film to come along that will, without a doubt, demand the perfect 10. And one would assume that this would not be that film.  I mean, it's disgusting, boring, reprehensible, obvious, and unoriginal.  It actually shows animals being killed and ripped apart.  So it deserves a ""0,"" right? Well, I think so, but I am not sure.What is a movie supposed to do, if not show us something we haven't seen before.  This plot is so stupid, these characters so disgusting and flawed, and this murder so indefensible that I am forced to wonder if this is the worst or greatest film of all time.  In real life, the plot isn't always interesting or brilliant, the people aren't always good or useful, and animals die by our collective hands.  AND there are actually people in this world who eat people.  This film is so stupid it's actually realistic.  It is bad, but so are we, and as the only film to be evil enough to actually show how bad we are, it must be great, right?  It must be the greatest film of all time, to show us something like this...something with no story or conventional filmic technique that dares to be as horrible as we are. There, it gets a ""10.""  Or does it?By the same logic, all pornography is equally brilliant for being willing to show us how graphic and lusty we are.  Now, I have nothing against pornography, but there is quite a bit of it, and by my own argument, there can be only one ""10.""  How do we pick which one?  Not only that, but what if someone comes along and actually makes a sicker movie than this?  Does that then get the ""10,"" or do we call it unoriginal for failing to be sick soon enough?  That is the problem with film criticism.  We never really know what we should look for.  And I don't know the answer, but I have figured out what to give this film...""0""...if we are to praise extreme cinema, we have to do so with a different set of rules.  When reality is all around you and there is no escape--even though the limits of cinema are being stretched--the value of cinema is being lost.  Because what is the magic of a movie?  The ability to shock us by showing us what is all around and scary and shocking and sadly true?  Or is it that more refined and useful ability to play off that reality and give us something in which to escape, and then something in which to find ourselves again?  As soon as someone figures out how to make a movie that is completely realistic and completely cinematic, then we must revise our views.

281,Mysticum,A Haunting Masterpiece,10,15 September 2008,"Those who have seen Cannibal Holocaust either love it or hate it. If you read reviews on this site, or anywhere else, ratings tend to land at the extremes rather than anywhere in between: some give it 10/10, others 1/10. As in all matters of taste, it is absolutely pointless to attack the other side for being ""wrong"" about the movie. The movie is what it is. Either you love it or you don't.With that said, I obviously belong in the category of people who love Cannibal Holocaust. So much so that I make no reservations about calling this one of the greatest cinematic achievements of the 20th century.I cannot abide animal abuse. I am to this day haunted by pictures of dead pets that I glimpsed for a second, years ago. I find the inclusion of real violence toward animals to be reprehensible, and yet I realize its purpose, and know that part of the overall effect of the movie is to be credited to this animal snuff. By switching between real animal killing and fake human killing, the line between fact and fiction is ever so subtly blurred, and the effect is powerful. I am very hesitant to defend cruelty to animals, but it is undeniable that it is part of what makes Cannibal Holocaust so stunning.Another key element in the movie is the breathtaking score by Riz Ortolani. The movie opens with beautiful shots of the jungle, filmed from a helicopter and accompanied by the most beautiful music I've ever heard in a movie. Then the music fades out, the plot moves along, and it isn't until much later, during the most terrifying and meaningless act of cruelty in the movie, that the theme song returns. The effect is simply amazing. I for one got goose bumps all over my body.The acting is not Oscar-worthy, but neither is it horrible. I found most of the actors to be quite convincing, and some of their reactions are certainly so, since the actors reportedly often reacted with revulsion to the scenes in which they acted.The plot is well-structured, and flows with masterful steadiness toward the climax of the final scenes. Apart from a few weak parts, the story and dialog are not at all bad. The way in which the feelings of the viewer toward the four filmmakers are manipulated is sublime, and ensures that the ending leaves one with a feeling of revulsion and satisfaction all at once.I cannot recommend this movie enough. If you, reader, have not yet seen this movie, I strongly urge you to seek it out. It is of course possible that you'll end up hating it for whatever reason, and that is a perfectly valid response to such powerful material, but it just might be that you react as I did, with awe and reverence.",Cannibal Holocaust

283,grahamn-5,A more profound movie that I expected,8,30 September 2018,"I'll admit it, I watched this movie because its notorious, but was surprised to find the cannibalism was minor. What it really is is a movie about exploitation that is a lot more than skin deep and mixes a fictional movie with reality in ways that are quite disorientating - I found that I couldn't easily compartmentalize the violence, rape and gore into ""this is just a movie"" as easily as usual. The reason is simple - the animal deaths are real, the guts that are portrayed as human are probably real animal guts, the director exploits the real natives (they were real and none of them get credits), the main characters exploit the natives, the natives exploit each other, the studio execs exploit everyone, I (as a watcher) am exploiting the natives and the animals.Very interesting to ponder in the days after you've watched it. Don't get me wrong though... the finale is pretty gruesome and looks very very real, partly because it maintains the handicam/lost film idea right to the end.I guess I didnt give it a 10 because the it doesnt really age well - but most certainly this is a one of a kind movie that can't be easily repeated - certainly not by Hollywood.",Cannibal Holocaust
284,LavaHound_76,Falls Short of Brilliance,7,20 November 2002,"If you have not seen Cannibal Holocaust then this is the review for you since it contains absolutely no spoilers.Prior to viewing Cannibal Holocaust I was warned about the incredible amount of violence it contains. This warning came in the form of a note written on the rental box at my local video store which basically said, ""Avoid if you're squeamish or an animal lover"".I've viewed a fair amount of horror films which had lots of gore, but this was way over the top and it didn't lighten up the situation with humor like Dead-Alive or Dawn of the Dead did. Real animals are slaughtered and eaten (some aren't) but if you've ever gutted a fish or watched a nature show then this will not bother you. Although, I must admit, the buffet of slimy guts the giant tortoise contained was quite disgusting. Fear not, all common household pets were spared.The story is about an anthropologist from NYU who ventures deep into what I presume is the Amazon Rain Forest of Brazil (called ""Green Inferno"" in the movie) to locate a film documentary crew who have gone missing, and to study the cannibalistic tribes of the area paying particular attention to the mysterious ""Tree People"". With a few close calls the anthropologist and his guides locate the Tree People and the dead remains of the film documentary crew. They also find tapes that the crew recorded for their documentary. The true horror of Cannibal Holocaust lies within these tapes. Expect the unexpected. Any further information of the plot would be considered a spoiler.Beyond all the gore, sex, and amoral acts there lurks something much darker in Cannibal Holocaust which should have been explored to a greater length if only the film could escape its own genre. For this reason I felt cheated to a certain degree. It's as if the viewer is shown a journey with the destination being the belly or the heart of a beast, but the journey ends abruptly in the beasts knee. If the journey ended in the beasts heart then I could have said that Cannibal Holocaust is a perfect blend of The Blair Witch Project, The Heart of Darkness, Lord of the Flies, and Natural Born Killers.A few worthy things to note:I rented Cannibal Holocaust on VHS tape so the picture quality wasn't good. However, I also saw a digitally re-mastered Collector's Edition DVD which I am sure has the best possible picture quality.The acting in the film is good. I'm sure the realism of the shaky hand-held camera work along with some great editing enhanced the performance of the actors.All in all, Cannibal Holocaust is a mediocre horror film which could have been a lot better. While viewing the film I kept asking myself who the real savages are. I did not over-look Ruggero Deodato and his team.",Cannibal Holocaust
285,dotdman,Arguably the best cannibal film ever (Possible Spoilers),10,6 January 2003,"First off, I was rather shocked with this film, and it wasn't because of the violence.  It's because it was so well made.  This is honestly a great movie with a very meaningful story if you can take the chance to see through all of it's genuinely disturbing factors.  There are no less than five scenes of rape, all of them utterly convincing and quite impactful.  The scenes of human dismemberment are simply the best that I have ever seen, in any film. There is also considerable animal cruelty, with the death of a muskrat, turtle, and pig to name a few.  And now on to the review.Cannibal Holocaust starts out with a professor going in search of a crew of four documentary film-makers who were documenting cannibals in the Amazonia. After getting together with two guides, Professor Monroe locates the remains of the film crew and their film canisters.  He is successful in convincing the Tree People to give him the canisters and returns to New York.Once in New York, he and a group of producers watch the crew's footage, and realize all to well why the cannibals killed them.  There are scenes of the crew huddling a group of natives into a hut and burning it, raping an innocent native girl, as well as shooting the natives just for the sake of media recognition.  But they soon turn from the hunters to the prey, as the cannibals capture each of them and kill them.  It is then decided that the film should be destroyed.This is a powerful film.  The mock-documentary footage is suitably realistic and the actors never fail to portray their characters just as they should. As I said earlier, the special effects crew new what they were doing, and have created the most convincing gore effects that I have ever seen.  And unlike most films of the same genre, Holocaust holds it's own in skilled acting as well as direction.  Make no assumptions, this is indeed a disturbing film.  But it is also a great film, and I recommend it to anyone who thinks they can handle seeing it.",Cannibal Holocaust

I'll simply tell you that whatever interest I may have had in it was completely washed away by a scene of (real) torture on an animal (a giant turtle). Don't get me wrong; I don't mean that it's OK to kill people (lots of which is done in this film, in most brutal detail) but not animals. I'm just saying that anything to do with animals, in this film, looked and felt much more grotesque than anything else.

289,CrimsonKingLives,Haunting and visceral,9,14 March 2009,"I first witnessed Ruggero Deodato's 'Cannibal Holocaust' about 5 years ago, so I was probably about 14 or 15. At that age, I was just getting into Mondo/Exploitation/Sexploitation/Sleaze/Gore/Giallo, the list goes on, 70s and 80s gore films. This was among the first few, along with Nekromantik and such.The film is almost 30 years old, and if you're a youngin I doubt you'll appreciate it much, although I'm 19 at the moment of this review, and I've loved it since the macabre day I laid eyes on it.The film has a unique and very eerie premise: A group of young folk who are well known for their controversial documentaries (The very disturbing clip from 'The Last Road to Hell')set out on a journey to what's referred to as the ""Green Inferno"" to study cannibal tribes in the wild. The group don't return months later, and soon a rescue team is sent out to find them.Among the team is Professor Harold Monroe, Mr. Chaco Losojos, and a guide to help them through the Green Inferno. What they come to realize is that the cannibals are, at first, very hostile, but are soon friendly in a way, and only to discover during their journey a horrific and disturbing display of human and animal cruelty.Most of the movie after their discovery is ""lost footage"" of Alan Yates, his girlfriend Faye, cameraman Jack Anders, and their guide Felipe in a world of mayhem and horror.The film is extremely real (most of the time) and pretty disgusting and graphic. Rape scenes are not of the norm, the violence is gory and horrific, and there are several animals, REAL animals, that are butchered through the course of the film.What's haunting, to me at least, is the end of the film, the last ten minutes of footage seen through the lens from Alan and the crew. It's horribly real and lingers in the back of your mind, and it took me a while to shake it off.The message is quite simple: Who are the real savages? The cannibals trying to live peacefully among other tribes in the wilderness, minding their own? Or the civilized, ""smart"" city folk of today, who are scared of change and the different? You make that judgment yourself.This grueling, horrifying and gruesome masterpiece gets a 9/10. Watch at your own risk",Cannibal Holocaust

Most notable, Green Inferno, the notorious film-within-the-film, gave birth to FF. The rest is history...'Holocaust isn't shocking by today's standards, of course. And yet, as vintage-horror playing by its own rules, it's still raw, still nasty, still thought-provoking — morally, politically and technically.

Pretty cheerful if you ask me. It constantly starts playing the most ill-timed moments in the film, but I guess it's to add some more effects.I was also a little disappointed with the amount of gore (I saw the uncut version). Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of gore in it, but I just hoped it was a little more gory when this film has the record for having been banned in over sixty countries and some of them still forbiddens the uncut version.

Now with this movie in the spotlight I decided to finally give my thoughts on it.  This movie is great and is one of my favorite films.  For 1979, it was ahead of its' time and very original.  As many have heard, the makers of the Blair Witch Project showed no shame in ripping off the plot which focuses on a missing documentary team and their ""lost"" footage.  Although I gave this movie a 10 I can understand some of the negative comments about it.  It is disturbing beyond anything I've ever seen.  The animal killings are repulsive and disgusting.  They serve no purpose and I personally kept my head turned during those scenes.  Looking apart from these scenes, the movie is perhaps the finest film to come out of the Italian horror genre. I can't agree with some of the negative critiques on the acting because many of the actors are dubbed. So aside from the realistic animal killings, Cannibal Holocaust is a masterpiece.  It's a classic worth being watched and judged fairly for the great movie I found it to be.",Cannibal Holocaust

I came out a little disappointed when it was over. I expected more, I guess. The effects were very good and some of the film was difficult to watch, especially the scene with the forced abortion. Far as the animals go, the turtle was 100% not necessary and barbaric. I read about this scene and when I saw it coming I left the room, so my husband filled me in, to my dismay. The camera work is good and the score is haunting and beautiful. When you watch this you realize who the real barbarians are, and it ain't the cannibals.

And yes these films are often crudely made, the acting isn't incredible, etc. But that's not why I watch ""drivel"" like this.It's a good movie if you aren't put off by the extreme torture sequences and, in all honesty, does make some pretty strong statements about the media as a whole in its portrayal of violence.

301,Robot_Kitty,Abysmal..,1,9 August 2011,"Where to begin..The plot as other reviewers have stated is probably already known to whoever is reading this so I won't waste words explaining it. Suffice to say that I was wholly unimpressed with it. It was not creative nor original. I was not compelled to think about society and it's morals, rather, I was compelled to think about society in regard to how one could possibly call this amateur attempt at filmmaking a ""movie"". Acting: What acting? I am all for attempting to capture realism and so forth in a movie but I am appalled that some other reviewers deemed the acting anything more than abysmal. It felt as if the actors were reading their lines off of a TelePrompTer rather than having memorized them and recited them with passion and conviction. Dialogue: Let me start out with this statement: I do enjoy 80's action movies and so forth and as such I don't mind corny one-liners, somewhat cheesy, bad dialog and what not. This movie elevated the definition of cheesy to new extremes. The dialog sounded like a fourteen year old who has a D for a grade in English class had written it. Normally, in a decent movie the dialog is meant to illicit some form of emotion, serve as a vehicle for character and plot development and so on. In this movie, I would say it detracted from the experience. Whenever one of the ""actors"" (though I find it offensive to put them in the same category as credible actors) reads a line and spews it forth it comes off as contrived and unbelievable, not that it isn't to begin with but that is beside the point.""Special Effects"": Well, if you enjoy movies that don't even qualify as B grade horror than you may enjoy this. I was looking at the display to see how far into the movie I was because though some scenes were brutal, I found them utterly ridiculous and boring. The special effects (if one would go so far as to call them that, as they lacked any semblance of ""special"" and barely qualified as ""effects"") were fairly atrocious. I won't spoil the killings for the reader but I WILL say that as stated before, I found them banal and ridiculous.Entertainment Value: Seeing as I am an individual and tastes vary I won't make any broad claims but I found the movie to be nothing but an exercise in pointlessness. Watching this movie is like watching a child pull the wings off of a fly and then burn the fly and watch it writhe in agony before finally stepping on it. To anyone who finds that entertaining, Its like watching a group of adults who are drunk play ""Scene It"" and act out the scenes from the movies then drinking some more and attempting to hack apart a chicken. After hacking apart said chicken they then proceed to play with the organs and laugh hysterically whilst trying to appear serious and menacing.That is what I experienced when watching this movie. Some may see this as a masterpiece but I see it as nothing more than a black hole that sucks viewers in and spits them out 90 minutes later wondering what just happened and lamenting the 90 minutes of their life that was wasted.",Cannibal Holocaust
302,rrclimber,Like a porno for gore.,5,6 February 2006,"It is not surprising that this film stars a former porn star. The plot plays out pretty much the same way. Much like a porno, where the plot serves only to get you from one sex scene to the next, the plot of CH serves only to get you from once scene of intense gore to the next. Here is the general idea: A group of documentary film makers goes to the Amazon to film Cannibals. They disappear and so some big wigs in NY hire a guy to find out what happened to them. He finds the film and takes it back to New York with him where they watch it in a attempt to have the footage shown on TV. The plot of this film is really of very little consequence. If you are interested in this film it is surely not for the story line anyway it is for the gore. The idea here is fit as much over the top gore into one movie as possible. Want to see a turtle dismembered? You got it! Want to see a guy get his cash and prizes cut off? No problem! How about a woman getting a forced abortion and then having her newly aborted fetus buried in the mud? Sure! It goes on and on... The acting is sub-par at best. The tribal rituals are laughable excuses for violence and the only really disturbing scenes in this movie are the when violence is done to living animals.

303,tomouse23a,"Brilliant, Not only a must for genre fans, but a must for everyone...",10,12 September 2007,"...who can stomach it that is! Not only does this film deliver what is promised, it raises many morality issues that so many films attempt to acknowledge but fail horribly.The basic plot is good as it is: A professor is hired and funded by a college to rescue a team of documentary makers who went missing in a jungle in South America, however it is made all the more intriguing by his find of their films - and his ultimate screening of the films to TV executives upon his return.The gore is all there, but in such an instance I would say the term 'gore' is unnecessary as the violence within is wholly necessary. Literally each wound is there to provide some support to the story or actions of the characters - after all this is about how these people lived, so none of it was out of order for them.The film brings up the idea that attempting to westernise or alternatively attempting to demoralise foreign or what some may call primitive peoples is a foolish idea and that the very idea is primitive in itself, whereas the use of the word primitive to describe the peoples is in-fact misused as their way of life is simply different to our own, a fact which most of us westerners find difficult to comprehend.I'm gonna round off now cos as you can see I could go on for years about this.Basically what I'm saying is that the film isn't about the violence, it's about the people and how they deal with the situations and how they treat each other and peoples with whom they are not familiar.If you choose to take my advice and view this motion picture, then hopefully by the end, if it effected you as it did me you will find yourself - like the film's Dr. Monroe - thinking ""Who are the real cannibals?""

I had read so much about it and the trouble it caused that I had to see what the big deal was. I'm still waiting to find out. This movie is a joke. The directing and acting are terrible (go figure...bad acting in a horror flick), the characters unlikable. Since I knew ahead of time that there are real animal killings, I was able to stay on the lookout, and I forwarded past them. Call me a wimp, but I see no reason to watch animal slaughter for cinematic purposes. So, excepting the animal cruelty, I have NO FREAKIN' IDEA why this movie was barred in, what, 5 countries? I fail to see the controversy. The gore is absolutely laughable, and is no worse than any of the Faces of Death movies. The cannibal people apparently had no language of their own, because all they did was grunt and scream to communicate. This gives these scenes the air of being conceived and acted by teenagers with clubs. Governments arrested the director for indecency? People actually thought this was snuff? Ridiculous.

Without going into too much detail, a small group of people go into the amazon and with complete 'white man' arrogance start to f**k with the natives (literally) leaving them fair game for all sorts of nastiness. They film their exploits with complete disregard for the danger that lurks all around them and their film is later discovered and shown to a couple of 'normal' people who raise the only moral objections in the whole film (with the exception of the guy who found the tapes). the film contains multiple scenes of rape (white on black, black on white) and torture (including a particularly nasty scene on the coast) as well as an exceptionally high amount of animal torture (look out for the scene involving a knife and a screaming muskrat, even I found this to be quite disturbing). All in all an excellent picture with enough gore and sadism for the most twisted of us. If you like it you'll REALLY like it, though if you haven't seen 'Cannibal Ferox' I would advise watching that first to strengthen you constitution. If you're just going to watch it and then complain about the content, please don't bother, this film is not for you.",Cannibal Holocaust

This movie will separate the boys from the men, and it's saying something too. To me it's that we as humans being are all savages. I don't believe the Animal killings are as bad as most people seem to think. If you were in the jungle and wanted to eat you'd kill that turtle the same as they did. And I do believe that they ate the animals after. So if that bothers you then eating a cheeseburger probably should do the same thing then. Because they do have to kill a cow to make it..... But back to the movie ahaha. This one goes all the way, awesome gore, animal slaughter, a bleak statement on the human race. Is this the greatest movie ever made? I think so.",Cannibal Holocaust

308,Baphomet-4,Dramatic and ambitious,8,18 March 1999,"Cannibal holocaust is easily the most messed up ""legit"" film that I've seen. But tenderness aside, is it worth hunting down, (ha!) and paying huge prices to watch, and endure? Well, yes, I think so.The tale begins with an anthropologist venturing into the amazonian ""green inferno"", infamous tribal cannibal territory, where they quickly capture a live savage, who they use to lead them safely deep into the jungle, in the hope of recovering film reels shot by a previous expedition. The savage leads them to the land of the ""tree people"" and the team find and recover the reels, in exchange for a tape recorder. Cut to civilization, where the reels are examined, and restored, with the intention of broadcasting them nationwide, but the network executives haven't actually seen them yet...So what's the fuss about? Well the scenes that stand out are the animal killing scenes particularly, including the painful killing of a muskrat, the decapitation and gruesome disembowelling of a giant turtle, (bear in mind this is done by the actors) The punishments for adultery, the gang rape of tribeswomen, and general murder and mutilative cannibalism of tribesmen and explorers alike, one of which looks very real, a little too real...Through all this visceral gore and gruesomeness, there is a basic point: We may live in cities, surrounded by techie advances, but ultimately, we are the real savages, and have no real right to encroach on so called ""primitives"".What I can't believe is that this film has been released almost worldwide at one time or another, which is odd, since Rugerro Deodato has made a very dubious film here. Nevertheless, it is worth a viewing, although don't expect to like it, as it is utterly tasteless.",Cannibal Holocaust
309,IrisGoeth,Sad irony...,1,7 July 2007,"Amazing and very depressing to see how many adult individuals will justify, deem irrelevant or simply ignore the killing and torturing of animals in the name of human entertainment and shallow shock-value. A really AWFUL film which relies heavily on the visual representation of violence and kills animals because HUMANS CAN'T BE MINDLESSLY KILLED ON SCREEN IF YOU EXPECT TO EARN SOME BUCKS, is a cowardly, hypocritical and clearly damaging work. It's degrading to watch, to make, to sell and to buy. It tells a lot about people and their numb ways. Really hopeless...I could of course just say that the story is stupid and cliché, that the characters and actors are extremely poor, that the cinematography couldn't be worse, that the music is frankly pathetic, that the ironic oh-but-we're-violent-too! twist is laughable and unbearably childish. I could arguably point out that this ""work of art"" (hah hah... ) would have been forgotten the very minute it was premiered had it not been followed by sheer controversy on the grounds not of some revolutionary philosophical standpoint but thanks to the most reactionary and ordinary tool available: gratuitous, easy, law-abiding cruelty. But quite honestly, after having witnessed the deaths of several animals just for the sake of it, and to make the fake and boringly told human deaths more shocking (what a cheap trick, gawd... ), I can't even said it's a film what I've just watched. It's a piece of pathetic crap. It's so easy to shock people by torturing defenseless beings. And it shows below-zero brain activity. Congratulations.It's all so ironic and amusing, yeah...

310,kubpink,Hypocritical at all cost,2,11 August 2006,"I came across this some years ago. It carried a Tagline reading ""The most controversial movie ever"" or ""The most violent movie ever"", which I have to admit, hooked me. I saw it only recently though, when my brother brought me the 25th anniversary DVD edition. I call it ""cinematic form of expression"" because, to me, it doesn't deserve the ""movie"" denomination. Actually, I can't find any qualification that suits ""Cannibal Holocaust"" fine. This is the telling of a journey through the jungle by two crews of occidental people. A second crew looks after a first crew of reporters, which aim was to shoot a sensational documentary on cannibal tribes living in the Amazonian Forest. The second crew, led by a so called ""professor"", discovers the reporters' rests, their film, which is taken and showed to the civilized world: us, the viewer. The footages consists of several (actually real) animal killings and several (fake) human murders committed by 4 morons laughing their pleasure of doing it out loud, and who end up dismembered and eaten by the people they were viciously taking the p**s out of. The professor's quest also consists of killing animals and slaughtering people notably with the help of machine-gunned soldiers. Cannibal Holocaust finally consists of muddy rapes and dancing naked in a river while being sex-toyed by a bunch of nymphomaniacs. All this is meant to be real and tackled the way documentaries report real facts. But it's a failed attempt, due to the following aspects. INTENTION: denouncing our modern world bestiality and mass media as manipulated tools, through the objective eye of the camera. Cool, but why such a ""subtle"" showing of everything? STORY: see above. SCREENPLAY: meant so serious and dramatic that you can't stop laughing. Several lines are cult classic. ACTING: was there any actor? They were so good it seems these guys had been doing it (e.g. tearing turtles apart) since they were born. Very deep a**holes! ART DIRECTION: they had to kill real animals to make you doubt and be OK with the blood and dismembered bodies design coarseness. No need to mention the use of custard to fake vomit. PHOTOGRAPHY: 16mm camera for the real footages, 35mm for the professor sequences. But why both were used the same way? The picture is grainy, shaky well, documentary-like. EDITING: Where did these Ed Wood style shots came from (snakes, crocodiles, monkeys...)? Otherwise, that's -overall scene shotclose up shotaction shot- sequences one after another. Simple and effective! Or should I say boring as death? SOUND: unsynchronized several times, coarsely dubbed, lousy effects (gunshots, screams). MUSIC: too prominent, as irritating as the sound and made to cover the latter. DIRECTION: obliging, admiring and thus praising what it is supposed to denounce; it's hypocritical and insulting the viewer's intelligence.

So the government decides to send there an American ethnology specialist, with to help him a sort of bad-ass Rambo afraid of nothing, and an Indigenous who knows the tribes and the forest by heart.The films focuses on the professor's travel and in parallel the footage shot by the American reporters. This is the shocking part of the film , where you find out their methods to approach the local tribes. This film is known as many people as a horror or gore film, which is wrong. Of course there are some unbelievably violent scenes of animal killings, or rapes, but the real aim of this film is to denounce the modern methods of the reporters, who are ready to do anything to amaze. There is also a brilliant critic of the relation between occidental people and Indigenous people. To finish, a word about Riz Ortolani's music : He's a genius !

This was my first Vipco's vault of horror film and i watched it with my friend who i'd told. As much as i knew it was only a film and the acting was fairly laughable, the special effects had the film looking like a snuff flick. I understood why it was under investigation from police. There are various scenes in the film, which get carved into your mind and you can't forget. I liked how it was filmed, the style, really added to its effect. Its filmed as a documentary off explorers cameras. similar to the style of Cloverfield but without all that shaky camera business. The main theme, love it. Really made me feel so uncomfortable. For an old early 80's film, this film delivered a shock, that made Hollywood films like Saw and Texas chainsaw massacre look like the Teletubbies. This film is a definite win, if your up to been shocked and very disturbed.

I now see where films like ""the Blair witch project"" got their inspiration. the only difference here is that cannibal holocaust shows literally EVERYTHING. The first half of the film built suspense and laid down the story for the rest of the film to follow. the native tribes were very realistic in their portrayal of primitive, and violent people. the disturbing parts of the film are in the second half, and build up the almost unbearable tension until the devastating, brutal climax. where my mixed feelings are about the film is it's multi layered characters. i do feel that the journalists were savage and brutal and deserved what they had coming to them, but on the other hand i did not feel that i had to see it in such horrifying detail. if you want to see a scary movie, i highly recommended this one. although it is nearly unwatchable, not due to it's direction or action, but more it's content and realism. be warned that there are real animal deaths on film, which added to the extreme controversy upon it's release, but i only feel that this made the film seem more real, and it succeeds in making the viewer uncomfortable and ultimately...afraid. but that's hat horror movies are supposed to do, this one certainly holds up to the hype.",Cannibal Holocaust

316,peytong00,"Once you've seen it, you'll never unsee it...",7,14 March 2019,"Cannibal Holocaust truly is one of the most disturbing and uncomfortable films I've ever seen. Released in 1980, the movie has gained a reputation over the years as being one of the most controversial films ever made, and I think it rightfully deserves that title. Now this is a hard film to recommend, especially considering all of the brutal onscreen violence, rape, dismemberment, genital mutilation, and of course the incredibly hard to watch real life animal killings. However, whether you love or hate the film you can't argue that it's very well crafted. As with most Italian movies the cinematography is great, the soundtrack beautiful and the locations exotic. The tropical scenery truly is stunning to watch and music even greater to listen to.The film focuses on a group of young film makers who venture out into the Amazon Rainforest to make a documentary on the local tribes, and as to be expected they never return. A professor is destined to recover the lost footage to put the story to rest and hopefully find out what happened to the crew. What unravels next is an example of one of the earliest found footage horror films ever conceived, made nearly two decades before The Blair Witch Project, and similar to that film the director strived to convince the audience that what they were seeing was real, so much so that he had the actors sign contracts to disappear from the media for a year to let the realism of the film sink in which later lead to his arrest, as the courts were convinced that the deaths depicted in the movie were genuine. However once he was able to get in touch with the actors and have them appear in court all charges were dropped, other than a small fine for the animal killings.From its shocking visuals to its gritty realism Cannibal Holocaust is a very effective film that, like many people have said, is very realistic and has a much deeper meaning to it than one might think. Director Ruggero Deodato's intention (or so I think) was to make a film that deglorified our civilized society, showing the viewer that we, the civilized people, are the true monsters, not the cannibals. The movies' pessimistic tone and negative outlook on society actually makes for an overall depressing and unpleasant experience, a film that truly makes you feel bad in the end.The movie has quite a sporadic fan base, with famous directors like Oliver Stone, Quentin Tarantino and Sergio Leone all supposedly being confessed fans of it. So much in fact that Oliver Stone payed homage to the film by replicating one of the most famous scenes in his movie Platoon (1986) and Sergio Leone wrote a letter of gratitude to Deodato complimenting him on the realism and the ability to produce such an effective and encaptivating movie. If you're looking for a fun horror film to watch with friends this is definitely not it. The movie is very dark and unsettling, making the viewer feel horrible after watching. Approach with caution, this movie is not for the squeamish, faint of heart, or easily offended and I suggest that those younger than 17 should avoid completely, only recommended to the most hardcore of horror fans and exploitation enthusiasts.

I suggest you watch it but this is not something you will be chatting with your parents about over dinner.When I first saw the film, I had no information on it and assumed that all the scenes were real. I thought I had watched a snuff movie. Even after doing a bit of research, I still look upon this as the closest thing to snuff I have seen (including The Guinea Pig part 2).Aside from the gore, the film has a very uneasy edge to it.

It's certainly disturbing to see animals killed in horrible ways for no other reason than to convince the director that he is furthering his ""art."" Killing the cow in Apocalypse Now probably qualifies as essential to the movie; the killing of animals in this movie just looks like a perverted mind getting off on how ""edgy"" he's being.Other than that, I didn't find this movie to be shocking as much as boring. It's really hard to be shocked by the violence as you have zero emotions invested in the characters, mostly because they are so wooden. It's saying something that the most convincing actor in the cast was mainly known as a porn star.The plot is almost non-existent; it feels like the things that happened did so only because there was no other way to get to the end of the movie.Also, I have no idea why anyone thinks the cannibals are scary. Basically, the scenes with the cannibals looks like somebody went to the local Home Depot lot, found some undocumented workers, threw a bit of paint on them, then told them to run around in a field and scream a lot.I can think of so many better movies for people who might be interested in this garbage due to stuff you've heard on the net. If you're looking for something that is just flat out disturbing, watch Salo or Irreversible. If you want gore, get a good copy of Day of the Dead. If you want to see natives acting like natives, see Aguirre.The only reason I gave this a 2 instead of a 1 is that I only give a 1 to movies I know I will forget.

The footage was so realistic, that the director was charged with murder until he proved the cast were alive and well.Beneath this gruesome facade lays the narrow divide between what is considered to be civilised and what is deemed barbaric. The first half of the film picks up the pieces of the final and most hard hitting half which is the lost doco footage. Is it here where Holocaust really shines in its desired context. By the end of the film, we are cheering for the Amazonian tribes-people lost in a forgotten time, and leering at the sensationalist Western filmmakers who substitute their moral conscience for the most depraved acts of murder and pillage possible towards these villagers.

326,hearse_for_hire,An inflection point in cinematic history.,8,20 October 2013,"Cannibal Holocaust is a film approached by viewers with a variety of attitudes, ranging from reverence to utter disgust. I will attempt to add my two cents to the pile without retreading too much or delving into cinematic history too far. Cannibal Holocaust is a 1980 film directed by Ruggero Deodato, chronicling the journey of an NYU professor into the South American jungle to recover the films of his four associates, who have mysteriously disappeared whilst on assignment. With help from some equally experienced and jaded guides, he navigates through the lands of the Yacumo tribe to the Yanomamo tribe, who with some coaxing and a peace offering relinquish the films of the crew. With some other associates in the television business, he reviews the films and learns the horrible truth behind the film crew and their expedition, which ultimately forces the viewer to question: who is the civilized, and who is the savage?The professor's journey serves as a lesson, wherein we learn about the intricacies of the two tribes, and how despite the typically Western view of such cultures and their inherent brutality, there is indeed a sense of justice and a harmony among these people. But make no mistake: the jungle is still a dangerous place, and the justice itself is both harsh and swift.What we learn from the footage of the crew is that while the outside world views the tribes as a primitive and backward people, it is ultimately the conduct of the outsiders in the film crew that disrupt the balance of life in the tribes, and the result is captured in all its gory glory on the film.This film contains not only gore in the conventional horror sense, but a certain amount of real life animal killing. I will not run down the list of animals, but the most famous/infamous scene, which features a large turtle, is one of the most sobering things I have seen in any movie, ever. Even as a jaded horror fan, this scene still induces a chilling silence in the room, in both mixed company and my own solo viewings. From a historical perspective, this movie is extremely important, as the culmination of the entire ""Mondo"" genre and a prediction of things to come in human experience and entertainment. The film ""Mondo Cane"" represented a bleeding edge of film, where human experience, sometimes sublime, sometimes frightening, was captured in real time on film. Only after some time and investigation did we learn that some of Jacopetti and Prosperi's classic footage was embellished, or in some cases outright fabricated. Flash forward a few years to Cannibal Holocaust, and we are forced to ask ourselves the question that arises from this phenomenon: If we can take cinema verite and make it ""realer than real"", then what limits are there to impose? We can not only capture the truthful horrors of the world, but make an even more repugnant reality by manipulating the brush with our own hands. And to what end? Before, it was to outline a certain line against which reality and human morality bristled. Now, we use the line for our own ends to create outrage, and the resulting titillation is entertainment. So, by nature, this film is the climax of a wave of Italian cinema that predicted our current forms of entertainment, like reality TV and other self-referential products, by a good amount of time.But, the judgment is yours. Is it right? Wrong? Were these the only films, or even artistic movement to predict this concept? Maybe it was the inevitable result, as bloodsport is not unique to humanity, but comes and goes in waves. So, art? Trash? You be the judge. But I implore you to definitely watch it!An interesting note: some people have seen this and thought it was a snuff film, which gives me a laugh. But one thing does sit oddly with me. If this was an Italian crew, in the middle of Colombia, how did they get all that meat and blood to shoot those gore scenes? Maybe reality is a little more blurred than I once thought.",Cannibal Holocaust

Well it's hard to talk about this movie, i mean i really think it was awesome movie. BUT there were scenes in there that just made me want to fast forward. There was a lot of graphic material in this movie that is very VERY disturbing. I felt weird after watching the movie when i was in my car, and kept thinking about some of the stuff that was shown. Especially the animal killings. It is sad enough to see special effects fake animals die in movies but the animals were REAL. They killed REAL animals. I think that is wrong, especially because the only reason these animals were killed was for the sake of a movie. That is just sick. I would have honestly gave this movie a 10 if it wasn't for that. Animals dying for the sake of a movie is sick that is why i will give this movie a 7/10. *POSSIBLE SPOILERS* The plot was really genuine, actually , it was one of the coolest plots i have ever seen in a movie, and the question of ""who the cannibals really are"" is very neat to think about. Another scene that i DO NOT want to see again is the total mutilation of that one American documentary cameraguy. That was so disgusting, and it looked so real. HE GOT CASTRATED!! and they showed it close up. EWW GROSS. The rape scenes were also very disturbing, and they were very graphic. The Special Effects in this movie were honestly some of the best I've seen. For some parts it really looks like people are being murdered. I still think that cameraguy is missing his penis. That scene was incredibly real. And so was the pole that is holding the dead girl. I repeat the special effects were a 10/10. I just wish that the animals were fake and didn't have to die for a movie. or this would have gotten a 10/10 from me.It was the most graphic/disturbing film i have ever seen",Cannibal Holocaust

Seriously this movie was crap at its finest, freaking boring shizzle. As for shocking moments? There aren't any, except that there are some animal slaughters ( only thing that was real )and some guy who gets his privates cut off ( but that looked so lame you wouldn't believe ). Now for the more basic stuff.. the acting was horrible at best..no known names in this turd of a movie. The directing was bad as well but the worst part besides the acting and the plot has to be the cinematography which seriously made me wanna hurl.So what else can i say except AVOID this garbage.. unless your one of those social rejects who gets his kicks out of animal slaughters.",Cannibal Holocaust

I don't mind watching bad special effects in a film. I know that no one was actually injured or killed in making this film. BUT, animals are actually tortured, mutilated and killed in this film. For this reason, I don't recommend this film nor will I watch anymore of it. Animal torture is NEVER ""entertainment"". There's a huge difference between fake death for films and the real mutilation and death of animals. This film crosses the line and should be banned. It's pure garbage. Screw the film makers. They should have gone to prison for what they allowed to be done to those animals. This is not entertainment!! It's more like a snuff film or a crush video. I HATE IT.

However, torture and violence is NOT an essential part of a human diet. And that's exactly what this movie was.Anybody who had a part in making this movie should have their face cut off by a machete, and be cut apart limb from limb and then be EATEN by anybody who enjoys this film before they are kicked and then shot in the head, so they can talk about animal torture in the darkest circle of Satan's Domain because that's where the turds who kill animals go.",Cannibal Holocaust

It's positively disgusting, but written well enough that it still has a cohesive, compelling story between the grossout moments, which is something far too many ""extreme"" films lack. The characters are well-acted and compelling, and though you know that the film crew will ultimately meet their demise, you find yourself feeling a warped sense of justice seeing it unfold in all its grisly glory.
This is the only movie that has managed to make my stomach churn. I could talk about the animal cruelty, as so many have, but I feel that since the animals were all later eaten (or so I've heard), it's just a fact of life that we first-world movie-goers aren't used to seeing portrayed in such graphic, visceral fashion. The soundtrack only helped it along, heightening the anxiety that came along with these scenes and helping to truly cement the film into the back of your mind forever.

343,hfrostyboy,Good...but excessively over-hyped.,6,14 October 2005,"Before finally getting to see this film, I had read the requisite amount of ranting and hype that the good old internet is full of. Most fans of horror or cannibal films will begin foaming at the mouth and begin to tell you all about how this is the greatest film of all time. It is good, but it has far too many glaring flaws to recommend without some kind of warning.To begin with, the version I own is the uncut version, animal killings and all. I should probably get this out of the way first. The animal killings are incredibly morally reprehensible. Whether or not you want to watch them is your own decision. They do, however, serve a purpose in the film. The killings are done in long takes so there is no doubt that they can be real. This shows exactly how living creatures are expected to bleed and look inside when they are beaten and sliced open. In many ways, the prosthetics used for the human killings are modeled to look like the animal ones. This succeeds in blurring the line between fantasy and reality and making the film all the more disturbing.And despite all the hype, the film is not as gory or graphically violent as you might expect. My first reaction as a gore-hound was one of disappointment. Where was all the nasty stuff? Truth is, this film is going for the shock factor, not rivers of blood. If you're looking for kicks you might want to go elsewhere.In terms of story the whole affair is very ho-hum. Documentary makers disappear. New York Professor goes in to find them and their footage. It isn't anything to write home about but it serves its purpose.The film is divided into two parts. The expedition to recover the footage, and the footage itself. All of the acting and effects during the expedition section are incredibly hammy, low-budget, and overdone. In fact, they almost encourage you to turn off before you get to the good stuff. All of this is a device. It just serves to make the footage seem even more real.The music, by Riz Ortolani, is excellent. Some people hate it. Personally, I think it is one of the best soundtracks of all time. The juxtaposition of the happy, cheery theme music with the atrocities depicted is one of the most effective things in the entire film.Overall, those looking for a gore-fest will be disappointed, as will those expecting a subtle moral, but those looking for an exercise in clever and deliberate film-making will probably have a good time.And those who adore cannibal films will never see a better one.",Cannibal Holocaust
344,theLunchMovie,I want my 2hrs back...,1,18 February 2006,"I've recently heard that the average human life lasts about 650,000 hours. This breaks down to @ 74 years. That being said, when the moment of my death comes, my last thought will be ""damn I wish I had back those 2 hours I wasted on CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST."" Granted,CH was made with a modicum skill, but this ""masterpiece"" talk is excessive. The score sounds like elevator music. Every performance is one-note. Nevermind that the characters are unsympathetic -- that's actually minutely cool -- they are, most of the time, boring. And stupid. You have a sound girl who in the beginning is chiding her boyfriend/director about not being ready to marry her. Days later she screams at him while he participates in a gang-rape ... but wait -- she's not screaming 'cause he and their other 2 pals are raping a woman, she's screaming 'cause the camera is still on! Good film-making, and good art in general, should be about some attempt at truth. Not fact, but some revelation or expression of a point of view. For all the credit CH is being given in these pages for the ""Who are the real savages"" debate, moments like the one I just described strip away any of those points -- I do not believe these characters -- I feel like I am being lied to when I am asked to believe that these people would act this way. Therefore the movie is a lie ... and worse. It's a boring lie. Apart from some horrific treatment of animals (which has already been given tons of lip-service here so let me only say that it is tragic that these poor animals died for such a weak movie) the rest of CH is extremely tedious. Ya sit there waiting for the next shock ... and then waiting and waiting s'more and listening to that ""beautiful"" monotonous score.Points have been given to CH for being ""gritty,"" like this was some artistic choice. This was not a choice, this was a buncha hacks working so on-the-cheap that they couldn't $pring for anything better than hand-held. The score sounds like elevator music -- I know I awready said that, but I need to reiterate it in response to how many people said it was ""beautiful"" -- it sucked. Did it make for an unusual juxtaposition on a few occasions? Sure. It still sounds like Ross Geller plunking away on his Casio in Central Perk. Von Trier ending DOGVILLE and MANDERLAY with Bowie's ""Young Americans"" after 150+ minutes of Handel and Vivaldi -- now THAT'S a friggin' juxtaposition!!CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST is not scary. It is repulsive, but not shocking. Shock would require some element of surprise. CH ploddingly meanders way too often for any suspense to build to the point were a ""shock"" may happen.

Of course, in therms of plot depth, this movie is far better than them, but I wasn't expecting a warning sign for the cruelty of the civilized men, I just wanted some gore, and this movie was a joke. I nearly fell asleep.

And last night I watched it... What an absolute mess. This film is a joke. The acting is dismal. I can't believe some reviewers on here speak of ""realistic"" acting. I have seen better in Kindergarten Christmas plays. - The horror-scenes are unspectacular. The axes with which most killing takes place look pathetic, and the special effects are poor. - The nakedness and rape scenes are simple crowd-pleasers. As this film as nothing special to offer, Deodato throws in as many nude scenes as possible, which is typical for early 80's Italian B-movies. - The animal killings are sad (in all senses of the word sad). Deodato realises that these are the only truly gruesome scenes and he milks it by spending too much time on it.

347,RastaPiggy,Cannibal Holocast (8/10),8,25 March 2005,"Cannibal Holocaust has the name of being one of the most shocking movies ever made. Although it sure does live up it's name of being shocking, I'm not sure if it's the most shocking, because I never saw that many 'shocker' flicks, but I bet some mondo flicks are worse. But the gore, isn't really what make this movie so powerful and shocking. The rape is worse, but that isn't really he key element neither. This movie isn't all about the gore/rape, it tries to shock you by putting you in the jungle, with the crew and showing you what they did. How purely 'evil' they actually were. Offcourse it is fake, but sometimes you really believe it's all real.One of the most shocking scenes had no gore or rape in it. It just showed you how far these people would go for some images. The most direct criticism of the movie was directed towards the makers of Mondo Cane 'shocumentaries', ironically the makers did sort of the same, by slaughtering a total of 6 animals in front of the camera. Even though this is off-course gross and shouldn't have happened, you should realize this is nothing at what happens on daily basis in our 'civilized community'. I am a vegetarian, not without reason. Even thought the animals in this one are killed pretty brutality, they died a quick death compared to the animals in the bio-industry. But I'm rattling and probably boring you, so let's get back to the movie :).The movie is about a crew of 4 (3 men, 1 woman) who decide to go into the jungle of southern America (the green inferno) to search for 2 cannibal tribes in war. They never came back and a rescue expedition is organized. After a subtle progression in the Green Inferno they find the remains of the crew and the cans of film. Back in NYC a big TV company wants to air the material, but the professor that was on the expedition know's what the material shows and tries to convince the TV 'dudes' by showing them the most gruesome footage. This includes a total of 5 scenes of rape, a 'sh_tload' of gore, mutilation and other stuff that would surely gross out the average person.This movie isn't something you watch with a cup o' tea with your parents. You should realize before watching it, that it does have some very intense and graphic images. Make sure you can take it, and watch it. It will be worth it. Very powerful, intense and very well made movie. Never mind the acting, it's terrible with maybe an exception here and there. It will leave you thinking about it for the next few days.8/10",Cannibal Holocaust
348,MrOrange1980,Deodato broke that barrier...,10,22 March 2004,"With Cannibal Holocaust Ruggero Deodato managed to completely smash the barrier that Umberto Lenzi had been pushing at before him.The movie is perhaps the most brutal entry into exploitation cinema ever, more savage than Lenzi's 'Man from deep river'or 'Cannibal Ferrox', much more intelligent and self-aware than the likes of 'Slave of the cannibal god' or the damn awful 'Cannibal Apocalypse' or 'Eaten Alive' (oh dear, what happened Lenzi???)..... Cannibal Holocaust stands alone in its sub-genre.Deodato has a colorful record for raw exploitation cinema with credits such as last cannibal world (Jungle Holocaust) and the down-right cruel house on the edge of the park to his name, nut with Cannibal HOlocaust he transcended the genre as a whole...**POSSIBLE SPOILERS***(Not too in depth)The Story is fairly linear - a crew of journalist go into the Amazon to film the lives of the dwelling tribes and never return... A search team is sent out for them only to find that they have been eaten by the tribes and that the only evidence of what happened lays within the films taken by the deceased crew.... Arriving back in New York (Well, As near as you are going to get the feel of New York from Italian Directors such as Deodato and Lenzi) Robert Kerman's lead man begins to watch the footage he has procured from the cannibal tribes, this is when the real horror begins....I found myself watching this move with a real sense of dread as each scene ended, frightened of what might follow in the next scene.... Deodato has got the balance perfect, enough on-screen violence and savagery to disgust the viewer, but more than enough social-awareness and cleverly crafted irony to keep the viewer entranced with its downright beauty.One scene that nicely summed up the intelligence of Deodato in his parody of Journalistic media is when one of the crew is commenting on the sickening death of a tribe elder, and the fact that she will soon be eaten by crocodiles; as the girl in shot with him waves cheerily to camera, like a small child completely self concerned, unaffected and unmoved by her selfish ego.For any true fan of exploitation cinema (Particularly Italian), this movie will be your bible!!! For anyone who is unsure about strong violence I would seriously recommend that you give this movie a miss...The recent Grindhouse release is certainly the definitive DVD edition of this movie in my opinion. However, to see the infamous road to hell scene in it's entirety, the EC Ultrabit edition is the best version to get hold of10 / 10",Cannibal Holocaust

In an era of multi-million dollar Hollywood special effects Cannibal Holocaust gets it's point across in a direct, unflinching manner.

My generation has seen Iraq, 9/11, and Colombine, so in actuality a fake docu-drama doesn't get me all the worked up.Half way through the film one realizes the power of the film when it is revealed that the journalists themselves cause the cannibals to war and commit violent acts among each other.

351,Gensyn,"A grand tale of despair, apocalypse, and death.",5,12 December 2006,"First, I don't know how to effectively rate this, so I choose the middle ground, but that's irrelevant. I'm not sure it's a movie that's made to be rated in any normal way.No use rehashing what the plot is once more, suffice to say it's very efficient and was, at the time, pretty innovative. But the plot device would have been moot were it not for the stunning craftsmanship of Ruggero Deodato and co. It's an extremely well done production, and I have never seen anything like it before or since. One of the main protagonist of the movie is often overlooked: the Amazon jungle. It's probably one of the most terrifying place ever rendered in any movie. Cannibal Holocaust wouldn't be half the movie it is were it not for the permanent sense of foreboding one feels amidst the oppressive scenery. It's easy to have empathy, at least on that level, with the film crew. Deodato makes the viewer feel like he's lost in the middle of nowhere, in an incredibly dangerous environment where everything can happen, at any time. By ricochet, this sense of terrible isolation takes its toll on Alan Yates and friends, and is also part of why they snap and produce mayhem on the tribes they later encounter. The last reel of the crew's footage is probably the most intense thing I've seen on a screen. It is apocalyptic, disorienting, sordid and heartbreaking. In more than one way indeed, Cannibal Holocaust is a sad, despairing movie. And even though, by that time, the viewer is supposed to despise the film crew, it is quite disturbing to see anyone end up that way. The Pirkanen scene is a moment of such savagery, of such disregard for a human being that it stays with you for a long, long time. From his castration to his complete dismembering, it's a vision that will make anyone suffer, one of the most haunting scenes in any film.I have to add that these scenes, and most of the rest of the movie, wouldn't pack such a punch if it were not for the incredible score by Riz Ortolani, which is the soul of the movie, and the reason why some parts are so hard to watch.On the touchy subject of the abominable animal killings: perhaps everything and its contrary have already been said about those, but there are some precisions to add.The ""they were killed for food"" line of defense doesn't hold close scrutiny, I'm afraid. The shot baby pig wasn't eaten afterward, but left for dead as is, for one. Secondly, the infamous monkey scene had to be shot twice, so they in effect killed two animals. I highly doubt the friendly tribesmen stuffed their face twice with monkey meat because of the movie's needs, their love of monkey brains notwithstanding. Same as, I'm not quite convinced that tribes people do have goofy fun with turtle guts prior to eating it, when they hunt one. When I saw Pirkanen enjoying his fun and playing with the turtle's severed head (still gasping for air) in front of the camera, I somehow doubt it made his food better.For those who have the Grindhouse DVD edition, it's said in a crawling text introducing the feature that this matter has been ""a subject of regret for everyone involved, Ruggero Deodato included"". Allow me to highly doubt that, to say the least. As recently as 2003, when the one-hour documentary on the feature was shot, none of the crew involved seemed to regret anything in that area, to put it mildly. Barbareschi (who is the one who shoots the pig, among others) goes even so far as saying he simply didn't give a s*** at the time, and still thinks today that the scenes and the movie ""called for it"" (i.e. the animal butchering). So please. Enough hypocrisy already. It seems to me that the crawl text regarding the so-called regret of the makers was put there by Grindhouse only to justify what is otherwise a good idea, i.e. offering an ""animal-cruelty free"" version of the film on the DVD. I don't believe for one second that it is a sincere comment, though. The only ones apparently genuinely disturbed by this aspect of the movie are Carl Yorke and Robert Kerman (""it was like they had pierced heaven,"" as he put it, in reference to the muskrat's cries of pain and anguish as it is being slowly and painfully sliced open). Not Deodato, not Barbareschi, despite everything they might tentatively say to the contrary. As it stands, I think the film suffers much from this. It's the movie's major drawback, as has been said repeatedly before.No matter what the ""message"" is, annihilating lives for entertainment's sake is vulgar, cowardly, and inelegant. Case closed.All that being said, I think the point is not to like or hate this movie. Its qualities are obvious, as are its few but very nasty drawbacks. The point being, it's an experience unlike anything else in cinema. Whether one wants to have that experience or not should really be an informed decision. The first time I saw it, 25 years ago, I wasn't in the least aware of what was ahead, and at the time I deeply regretted having seen this. Watching it again recently has put, of course, a perspective on the way I see the film, if only because I've read so many things about it since I first saw it, but even so, many of the old sensations came back as the film unfolded when I watched it again.This is a very, very potent piece of film-making. This is something you can't ever unsee, and it's very unlikely you'll be able to forget some of the imagery once you've seen it, so proceed with caution and don't presume of your resistance to awfulness. This one has shocked many a gore hound...",Cannibal Holocaust
352,madballs4,review of some disturbing parts in movie,5,2 January 2012,"*This review may contain spoilers, I'm not paying attention to see if I am* I give it 9 stars, not because i enjoyed what he did in it, but because it is a very disturbing film. I have to give him credit for that. If you want to see this film, make sure to get the unrated Grind House release version, it's the only one that is completely 100% uncut. It is so disturbing because Deodato, I think his name is, didn't have a big budget, so to replace all of the gore he couldn't put in the movie, he murdered at least 7 animals, 6 on screen, for the movie. The one you don't see on screen is in one scene, the cannibals kill a monkey by cutting his head in half, and eating it's brains. He killed two for that scene, because the first one they killed he said they didn't do it right, so they killed another one. There is also a lot of rape in the movie, which is some of the most disturbing and gruesome scenes in the movie. Most of it is gang rape, and they normally kill the victim in a painful way in the middle of it. *If you watch this film, be warned. It is a very sickening film, do not watch if you don't have the stomach for it*madballs4",Cannibal Holocaust
353,john_life,Too much for me,2,25 April 2012,"I love horror flicks. Gore. Exploitation flicks. Getting Gangster flicks. True crime shows on ID or TruTV. Slayer's music.I thought I'd seen it all but I hadn't apparently. Ran across this awful movie by accident on the internet and decided to buy it. Watched it last night and it went straight in the trash.Mind you, I re-watch Zombie movies. I love ROB Zombie's movies. I've seen The Texas Chainsaw Massacre about a dozen times and it never gets old. But this flick I saw just went too far for my taste.I read the reviews, knew going in it was going to be hard to take but bought it and watched it anyway.If you're ever tempted to watch Cannibal Holocaust, don't. It's not bad as in cheesy or bad as in no plot or bad as in bad acting. It's bad because even if you're anti-censorship like me, it left me wondering why they did what they did in this movie.It's from the late 70's and was one of the first ""found footage"" movies (like Blair Witch Project), a novel concept at the time. The plot is as follows: Four documentary film makers (three of which have a mean streak and their girl Friday) have disappeared in the Amazon and an anthropologist goes to see if he can find out what happened to them. The first half of the movie covers his travels and the film he finds and his journey can best be described as interesting, semi-humorous, and non-offensive. Generally speaking, it's how you would treat natives if you wanted to engender good will and get out alive.When he brings back the found footage to New York and the network begins preparing it for broadcast, you get an idea of what you should NOT do to natives if you want to get out alive.Filmed with real natives, upon release the film was banned in many countries and the director was arrested. He had to prove it was not a snuff film.The film is advertised as ""a shotgun blast to your senses."" The makers of ""Hostel"" said it was the most disturbing film he'd ever seen. Those are spot on assessments.And just when I thought I was desensitized to portrayals of cruelty.",Cannibal Holocaust
354,tony_ramos5,The best cannibal film,9,10 May 2004,"Ruggero made a great film here.  He had us believing back then that this movie was for real, (what BWP wanted to do as well).  The first half of the movie is very mild and a little uninteresting, but the action picks up when the second crew finds the footage that was shot by the lost crew.  From here on anything goes.  This movie makes you think quite a bit, some people might just watch it and be repulsed by the gore and realness of it all (even the actual animal killings portrayed) but if you just dig a little deeper, you might see that what this movie is really about... when civilized people think that the rules of society are out the window... would they stick by them?  would you?

The film then essentially becomes blair witch but with some truly horrible moments of gore, all filmed with realism, and we then become the voyeurs of violence the same way as the investigators do as they view the footage, and try to make a sensational tabloid story out of.this is a genius structure for a horror film of this sort, works much better than blair witch, comments on many themes such as violence, voyeurism, disrupting ones territory, trying to re-sculpture those in society who have there own lifestyle (the tribes), the arrogance of white middle class society's desire to change those who are happy with their lifestyle and don't need it changing (the journalists).very gross and hard to stomach, but if you can, and can get hold of the uncut version, do so, the violence in this actually makes sense, unlike mels passion of the Christ.",Cannibal Holocaust

357,Fetusman82,"Sickening, a perfect exploitation film with a mild point.",7,12 September 2006,"In 1999, a film called The Blair Witch Project was released. There was plenty of talk surrounding the horror mega-hit. Mostly because of it's jerky, hand-held, unsettling camera work. But no one knows the technique was pioneered in the notorious, controversial 1980 film Cannibal Holocaust.Director Ruggero Deodato was arrested shortly after it's release, and the film was confiscated. Deodato was charged with the murders of his actors in the film. The charges were later dropped when the actors turned out to be alive and well, only serving a short sentence. Twenty-six years later, it's still as controversial and sickening as it was back in 1980.Salò, or The 120 Days of Sodom will always be the most disturbing film to me, but in terms of violence Cannibal Holocaust wins (and I've seen my share of shock cinema).Cannibal Holocaust has been known as one of the most notorious movies ever to grace our screens, and deservedly so. Mostly for it's attitude, realistic human murder scenes, and, of course, the real on-screen animal slaughterings. Especially the infamous turtle killing, where a large turtle is beheaded, deshelled, gutted, and eaten.Mostly shot with a hand-held camera, the film is given a more grainy quality and realistic feel to it.Another quality to the film is that you end up supporting the cannibals. For the white film-makers are more savage than the savages themselves (ex. animal killing, burning a village, and the rape of a native).Overall, the film is good, but it's not for everyone. It's not a life changing experience like 2001: A Space Odyssey or Salò, but it'll stick with you for awhile. And you'll definitely feel the need for a shower after you watch it.",Cannibal Holocaust

I heard of this movie and i took a shine to it. I've always been fan of gore movies, and things that generally screws with the mind. For about a year i thought of the movie and wondered where to get it and so on. Then i was watching Cannibal The musical, and it came to me, i remembered CH. So i pondered over the internet looking at reviews and clips and so on. I thought ""hey! I'll watch it"" So last night, i decided to download it (I know, its illegal) but it was just to see if it was worth getting the special edition.I got it, i was a happy boy. I started watching and i was bored at first then it all started to happen. The vicious savage beatings, the slaughter of animals, the rape of that women, which was seriously f***ed up considering the dude who did it shoved a load of mud in her, yeah...... I kept on watching, and then it came to the first real gory scene, the muskrat scene. I saw the man pick up the muskrat and just put a knife through its throat, it screamed, and the man kept doing it. I was DELIGHTED i knew i was in for a treat. The film, is well made in my opinion, i just loved how it was all filmed so carelessly like it was a bunch of people going through a rain forest. Well made, yeah, especially the brutal scenes of death. It looked so real, it makes you wonder if it is real at times. The turtle scene, where its horrible ripped apart, was amusing, its head kept moving XD A lot of scenes were generally pointless, like when the goofy army dude walked around naked with one of the cannibals on a leash What the Hell?!A lot of scenes satisfied me, but a lot were a bore, there's not much to the movie, except shock value. I thought the women impaled on the stake/pole was hilarious, and yet looked so real. With the animal killing scenes, i was comforted by the notion, they were eaten by cast and crew after filming. Its not a film you want to watch with your girlfriend or wife or someone like that. Unless they have a screwed up mind like you do. The part that was rewarding to watch was that ass-hole of a rapist get his penis cut off. Yes, JUSTICE IS SERVED!!!The film is great fun to watch, unless your an animal rights activist.

361,eperez-7,dinner and a show,4,12 January 2007,"I just saw this movie for the first time, but after first seeing the blair witch project. This movie was better only because it actually had some horror in it.* * * MAJOR SPOILER ALERT * * * ***Don't read any further if you haven't see the movie.*** The main criticism I have other than the dated score was how the atrocities were depicted. On the one hand the film crew drew first blood against the natives while no horrific music played in the background. These acts were no worst than what an enemy tribe would have committed. Yet when it came time that the natives retaliated then the horrific music played. I kept thinking, ""If you go into the jungle to commit a massacre on film, of course you're going to get what you deserve in the end."" The natives were better off left alone.* * * END OF SPOILER * * * I read that the music was particularly beautiful, after seeing the movie I disagree, I thought it must have been OK back in 1980, but I believe some people would find it annoying by today's standards.A lot of what happens that drives the characters forward is from their own observations of the natives. Unfortunately their misguided motivations are what get them in real trouble. Much of the reasoning behind the actions of the natives other than the retaliation is unknown or pointless, and its the assumptions of the film crew that attempt to explain what's going on.The methods vary, but the animal/killing/eating was the most violent part of the movie if you look at if from the standpoint that everything else is acted out. But these actions are no worse in the end than what any seasonal fisherman or hunter would do seen or unseen.As far as the authentic movie-within-a-movie footage of the road to hell is concerned, its far too brief (even in the 96 min. deluxe edition version) and only depicted what sort of history the film crew had and could have easily been omitted without being missed.",Cannibal Holocaust
362,Pelintra02,"The Pinnicle of all Exploitation Films, but by no Means Enjoy it....",1,21 January 2008,"Cannibal Holocaust is gritty, intense and disturbing, sadly it effects you the same way off screen for many days onwards. This is the type of film that is tolerated on a gut level, but should be by no means enjoyed. Whilst on the most part the animals slaughtered in this film were killed in true hunter gatherer fashion, the treatment of the south American tribes depicted on film is truly something unforgivable.The directional style of this film isn't really direction in a conventional sense and the acting for most part seems entirely improvised. This alone would make for an interesting pseudo realist picture, but combined with the blood curdling violence and the unnecessary rape scenes (and I will include the abortion of foetuses with that comment) Cannibal Holocaust becomes something entirely different. This is quite frankly a film spawned from the pits of hell.Sure one can argue that Ruggero Deodato and his crew of merry men were showing us a metaphor for our own westernised society, but I beg to differ. I can see no thought at all put into real life debates on consumerism, war or gender roles, this is exploitation at its pinnacle. A loathsome experience by any standard. The only thing more disturbing than watching Cannibal Holocaust is the thought of those in our existence who can frequently watch it with enjoyment.",Cannibal Holocaust
363,alfondo,Debate your morals,10,2 June 1999,"This is a must-see for everyone over 16 to debate one´s morals. It is a pornographic film, which means it may excite you, and it´s very thought-provoking at the same time. Very dark in style, also dark view of mankind, very sexy performances, many ingredients which make up a cult classic...My personal analysis:Humor      3/10 Drama      8/10 Offbeat    10/10 Music      10/10 Violence   10/10 Sex        8/10The music is overwhelming, it sounds pornographic most of the time in a seventies style; The apocalyptic chord arrangements are cruelly existentialist, I  must admit the music has a very disturbing effect on me.Of course it is a very cheap and repetitive score, but the effect is great, it strengthens the scenes.The film is very extreme, more shocking than scary, it´s got a strong drama component as well regarding nature in general, mankind,...  that won´t be appreciated if you cannot bear watching the bloody scenes (most people can, as I mention below, though most of us deny it).It makes you feel pity of mankind, but at the same time I found it absolutely sex related, it even excited me. Some of the characters are depicted as civilised people putting out their most primitive instincts while being inside the savages environment. And it must be noted that it is not as a defence at all from the cannibals: The reporters film a fire they cause on purpose as if it was a real fight among the cannibals just for the sake of filming something of interest for american viewers when they return home,they rape a young girl from the jungle, they f*** in an exhibionist way with all the cannibals watching them just for fun, ... They are obviously getting mad because of being in the jungle for so long, and because they begin to understand they´re going to die in a short while. They are ultra competitive, they are anxious about filming every monstrousity real or not, to be more prestigious as reporters.I really did not find the scenes so disgusting, but curious in style, very obscure, twisted and maddening. I liked most of the film camerawork, it´s very impressive. In Spain some medical TV shows are aired in which doctors perform live operations to patients. I hate this kind of show, it is even more raw than two cannibal holocausts together. I really find some of those scenes disgusting, everybody watches the show, and people don´t get so angry about it since it is about medical practises. People who don´t consider themselves as twisted or perverted find it interesting and entertaining (???). There´s too much hypocrisy, the same people would not bear watching it on films, as it seems a perverted portrayal of human nature or whatever to them.Many of the bloody scenes are both entertaining, and not really exaggerated. They are not just pretentious, but gives hints to the plot. The scene in which a huge turtle is disenbowelled will provide a good example. The white reporters are starving and there´s nothing to it around, having spent a few days in the jungle. These people are in a very unusual situation, and that´s what I like the most. From their reactions you know more about them, the girl pukes (she is the most sensible of them); one of them giggles and plays with the turtle´s head in front of the camera, just for fun, as showing off a trophy, which means they are competitive, unsensible people. It is not a coincidence that later on, the cannibal women play with this man´s head as a trophy, celebrating his death. It´s a great paralelism.Furthermore, whatever may shock you, might be a typical practise elsewhere. In Spain cows are still disenbowelled in small towns, because the tripe is sold afterwards as an edible product. Just imagine the scene, a cow´s intestine might be twenty times the turtle´s bowels. My parents don´t find that disgusting at all, as they´ve seen that through their lives many times.I enjoyed the rape scenes, which took me by surprise, since I never watch porno, or enjoy such scenes in other movies. The actors are all very sexy. I would pay for a porno movie featuring these men for the first time in my life.If you feel sick after watching it, I would recommend The double life of Veronica, just to get the impress that the world is more a magical place to be in, a more spiritual feeling of things and people... This is one of my cult favourites too, but it´s just the opposite view of the world. My election of a Kiewsloski film proves I´m not just a horror film buff when analyzing cannibal holocaust. I love Fassbinder, Bergman, Derek Jarman, and many art house films.Which of the two views do you like the most? The horrifying, agressive, in Cannibal Holocaust or the religious, spiritual, magical, lyrical in The double life of Veronica???  Your personal view is up to you, but which one is a closer portrayal of mankind?  Who knows?",Cannibal Holocaust

And it is pure exploitation. There is no ""message"". There is no fake.All animals were harmed for real. They were killed for this movie. The Savages who supported this movie ate them later on. But they ate them everyday. Not only when the movie was made!!  What are you eating each day? Have you watched a butcher at work?And a Message???  Ruggero Deodato had private problems in the late 70s. He was frustrated and in a very dark mood. So he wanted to create a very aggressive movie (it worked!!). Just because of some conventions and to make Canibal Holocaust more cynical he put in some footage about the jungle/city-comparison.Wake up guys!! This is not Tim Robbins!! This is Italy, the 70's, Ruggero Deodato!!

I consider myself desensitised to violence, so was not too shocked by the violent content. However, this is the most powerful and though provoking film that I have ever seen. For the first time in my life I was actully left feeling numb after viewing a movie. Everything about this movie is perfect. The acting is immense, considering that the majority of the cast were gained from acting schools. The cinematography is unbelievable for such a small budget ($100,000). In my opinion, the best piece of this brilliant cinematography is the scene when Professor Monroe decides to play a recording of the Tree People chanting, as a last ditch attempt to gain their trust. The way that the Tree People immerge from the thier giant tree house and the way they react is brilliantly shot and captured. However, the most special aspect of Cannibal Holocaust is the score. The main theme that Riz Ortalani created is a classic. I do not understand why some people lambast this film because of the animal killings. I have seen many upon many documentries on the Discovery channel and so on that show Amazon tribes freely killing rare birds, monkeys and so on. This was done for entertainment purposes. So there is no difference between the animal killings in CH and those shown in nature documentries. What are people trying to say?

368,fergarza71,"A movie so ahead of its time, it will never be equaled",10,7 April 2008,"While a lot of people would be offended by the subject matter, I find it fascinating as part of a genre that wasn't like this at all. Part of the Italian cannibal genre, beginning with Umberto Lenzi's 'Man from deep river' in 72, the main draw was as morbid as you could imagine, since the only thing going for these movies was to see a bunch of people being eaten by cannibals. Ruggero Deodato (and Franco Clerici) had the idea to be equal to the movies that were in vogue in those days, part of the ongoing 'Mondo' movies, like 'Mondo Cane' and 'Africa Addio', made by two Italian mavericks called Jiacopetti and Prosperi, who were also made famous by the same accusations of staging scenes for shock value on their documentary films. Of course Deodato being a filmmaker, decided to base his movie with this in mind, as a tale of black ethics and demoralizing anti-heroes that no way you would root for. That's the power of this movie. While I definitely do not agree with some of his decisions, they are part of what makes this movie look so real. There's no way a movie like this would get made today, since this type of 'guerrilla' filmaking doesn't exist anymore. It's obvious that Deodato was filming without any regret or remorse, and he wanted to make a film that would stick to you no matter what, and he succeeded. The tale is bare bones, but its social commentary is what puts it above anything else in the cannibal genre, and horror movies for that matter. The camera work, cheap sets, and passable acting add just what the movie demands, which is to say that it looks like it was made by amateurs, not professional actors or filmmakers. Let's not forget that indeed the cannibals look bad because they have to be like that to survive in the jungle, but the filmmakers in the story are far more depraved and horror filled that their means do not justify the end. In the case of Deodato, I have only but praise for such a maverick director to tackle such a difficult project that will be vilified and praised as nothing short of a masterpiece. Remember that this movie was made in the 70's and just to be still talking about it proves it's power to titillate and disgust.

Some parts were quite difficult to watch, but I thought that the cinematography was beautiful and the score was magnificent. Yes, it is a very rough movie to watch and I suggest no children under the age of 13 or so should see it, but of course this is truly up to the adult who decides whether the child is mature enough to watch it and not do anything stupid. I, myself, saw this film when I was 14 years of age and I did not go and do anything stupid, but some children are more easily influenced. My point is that it's not a Disney family film. It's art.

Secondly this is a low budget film and the quality of production shows this.This film however is fascinating: you can see where 'Blair Witch' and countless other movies got their ideas and influences from.

371,The_Berserker,Too Shocking To Be Exploitive SPOILERS,10,12 August 2003,"(Refers to the Uncut version)Having seen this version I can understand why both the BBFC in England and the MPAA in the U.S have always had a problem releasing this in its uncut form.Unlike many other films that fall under the 'art' category but are still shocking nonetheless (Guinea Pig: The Devil's Experiment & Salo to name but two) this film has no purpose on this planet other than to put in front of you a nihilstic vision of the world and to purely and simply shock you into oblivion. Though, on the other hand, what do you expect when you send a bunch of people with cameras into the jungle that's populace is made of cannibals?Basically, the version that many people all over the world have seen is the 86 minute cut (In Britain anyway, almost everywhere else it has either been banned or is still under consideration).In this version you see...Less cruelty to animals...The killing of a muskrat by the 'jungle tour-guide'. The complete evisceration of a large turtle. The kicking of a pig that is tied up. The head-slicing and blood drinking from a monkeys head.Less violence (both sexual and, well, beating up and stuff)...An angry native dragging his 'adulterous wife' through mud and forcing her legs apart. The same angry native raping and humilating her with - what seems to be - a large, wooden phallus. The same angry native putting nails into a mudball and placing the same mudball (with nails) in the woman's ""groinal area"".Less of the rape scene between the female camerawoman and her colleagues. Less of the female camerawoman being raped by the natives after they are overpowered.Less nudity throughout.All in all the film has 5 minutes and 44 seconds worth of cuts.On one hand I can see (after viewing the uncut version) why these cuts were made to the British video release, on the other hand I don't admire censorship and believe that people should choose whatever they wish to watch no matter how horrific.The question is - will these cuts be made to numerous other releases of the DVD/Laser Disc/VHS?Whether they do or they don't, this film is still as shocking today as it was whenever it was first released so bear in mind that it's not very pleasant, whatever the version.

372,Hannah-Balsom,Disgusting but thought provoking film,6,4 March 2005,"I'd heard a lot about this film and being a big horror fan I was itching to see it. I rented it out, settled back and let myself in for the most gruesome horror film I have ever witnessed. To begin with, I found it quite slow and within the first hour was beginning to feel myself getting bored. When's the horror going to start I thought to myself. I stayed with it though and was glad I did (I think!). The film contains the most gruesome scenes I think ever featured in a horror film. Even though the main characters (the film makers) are portrayed in a very bad light, and it is very hard to sympathise with them, I think you would have to be a monster not to feel for them with the torture they face. To watch a man having his testicles removed before being quite literally ripped apart is not a pretty sight. At times I nearly had to look away from the screen as I just could not stand the relentless horror of the situation anymore. I felt sick for ages afterwards and it really played on my mind because that sort of thing can and has happened before.The film seemed to try and justify itself by having a moral thread running through it. The film makers blatant disregard for the 'cannibals' and the rape and torture they put them through is hard to stomach. The film seems to be asking us to consider who the real monsters are. The cannibals or the film makers. And I would have to say it's a bit of both. I'm unsure however, if the makers of the film simply put this in to cover up for the fact that they were making a horrible film which would sicken anyone who saw it. They were trying to say ""Hey, this isn't just mindless violence you know, we actually have something to say!"" Overall, I wouldn't go so far as to say I actually liked the film but it did have it's good points. It has it's audience and will always be renowned for it's subject matter.",Cannibal Holocaust
373,faidwnasgk,Absolute garbage,10,23 March 2012,"Let me say from the beginning that I have absolutely no problem with scenes of 'brutality' or 'extremity' in films. It might not be my personal taste usually, but I think that every film should be watched for what it is, without creating subjective expectations.Having made this clear, let me take the next step into something even more controversial - the infamous scenes of real animal killings. I will be honest, I don't want to judge the film for its animal cruelty depiction - for many reasons. Most of all, because it would be unfair. Why? Because then, if we wanted to be fair, we would have to take the same fact into account when speaking about Tarkovsky ( 'Andrei Rublyov' ), Coppola ( 'Apocalypse now' ), Jodorowsky ( 'El topo' ) and the list goes on. All of these are filmmakers that tortured or killed animals for the camera in the films I mentioned, all of them genuine masterpieces in my opinion. And after all, can we really define with accuracy what's 'allowed' in art and what's over the top'? Of course the answer is no.But the problem is that the film doesn't stay there, it's supposed to be a 'social commentary'. And it is, indeed. A social commentary that only a lobotomized would appreciate, and I'm not even talking about the 'message' that the movie is supposed to have. I could even say that the film was quite a strong experience for the first 40 minutes or so, and when the real subject came up and the 'real face' of the teenage documentarists starts becoming clear, you simply can't resist thinking that if this was the ending of the film, it could even be considered as a great film. But no. Ruggero Deodato apparently has very little respect for his audience, thinking that the viewer is probably a retard unable to understand the 'deep meaning' of the movie, so he simply forces it with such naivety that after some point you really want to start banging your head against the wall and scream that even Michael Moore is an intellectual compared to this guy. The ultimate peak of stupidity comes in the last sequence, where one of the producers of the documentary - who by the way was a profit-hunting scum that didn't give a s**t about human pain so far - gets so shocked by the violence of the footage, that he commands for ''all the reels of the film to be burned''. And in case any viewer with an IQ of 5 didn't get it yet, don't worry at all! Because then you have the last scene, where the anthropologist/main character walks out of the building with a 'confused' face, and his consciousness wondering in voice-over 'who are the real cannibals'. Simply outrageous.I think the problem is that the director took himself too seriously and had an ambition that he wasn't able to execute without becoming ridiculous. And he probably got a bit confused along the way, because the 'real cannibals' of the film are obviously the ones behind the cameras.",Cannibal Holocaust

375,robert60000000,a rite of passage,6,11 March 2021,"I see Cannibal Holocaust as . It's famous for its horrific imagery, and that's the biggest overall feature of the feature.
We have some embarrassingly overdubbed footage going with less than inspired acting in some of the scenes, but where the movie lives is its interaction with the tribes and the latter half, where we see a new face of cruelty, coming from the more ""civilized"" part of the world. Of course it's all a commentary on sensationalist journalism, but when the creators themselves partake in sensationalist filmmaking, it smells more like a justification than anything else. Still it's a more interesting angle to approach the subject from. I was surprised at the horrific scenes, and some of the inspired choices made in the cinematography here. It's worth mentioning the score as well, which as great and as haunting as it is, the movie displays a clear formula in utilizing it. Something messed up happens? Bring on the scary or the cheerful score, sometimes one after the other for some ""artistic"" flare. It's effective, but repetitive. Still, the scenes themselves are extremely realistic, which is helped by the way they are shot and it's stark contrast with the rest of the movie. Be wary though, there are scenes of animal death and mutilation, which. turns out, are completely real. This is the point where one has to wonder if it even matters if an actor is portraying a character if the acts of cruelty are just the same.
All in all the movie is unique, but not necessarily great. What thrill seekers are searching for from the title ""Cannibal Holocaust"" they will definitely find, and will feel the impact of those choice scenes, but all the rest is just serviceable. Definitely wouldn't call this a classic.",Cannibal Holocaust

I go on tho, but after a scene where they kill a small monkey alive, and believe me, this is no fake, I start to skip thru the movie.

377,bloodyruddy,Beneath the bloodshed,10,4 September 2013,"Cannibal Holocaust is a necessary cinematic example of the deterioration of morality when released from a cultivated civilized society. A documentary film crew sets out into the Amazon to study the lifestyle and sacrificial justifications between the conflicted tribes of Yacumo and the Yanomamo. Exposed to the undeveloped lands of the Amazon, it is soon realized that the behavior of the student posse undergoes a drastic and disturbing direction. Their acts of rape, murder and destruction illustrate the distinction between human nature and human brutality. Their subjects as they see them indeed practice cannibalistic rituals and live primitively within the nature that surrounds them. Ironically, this becomes reason enough to elect a congratulatory dismissal for any cruelty/humiliation and destruction the film crew inflicts because they are fundamentally above these uncivilized people's. As to be expected, their victims lash back and resort to their animalistic resolution to threat - murder.So tell me.. who are the real savages? This film is very graphic and had raised a lot of speculation and controversy. The only thing that I would like to mention is the mutilation of animals. It is possible that the director may have approached these animal killings by asking these native people to demonstrate how they kill and prepare their foods. The remains may have been used. Personal theory.Beneath the bloodshed there is something to it!",Cannibal Holocaust

This is a horror classic.. The film was heavily banned due to the graphic violence and gore but mostly due to the on screen killings of animals. Despite the horrific imagery being shown on film, the music makes the movie feel like its not a horror movie because the music score seems to be happy and later turns crazy towards the end of the movie.

379,Cuclean,Cannibal Holocaust,9,23 February 2005,"I feel that this film may not be the best one ever made, in fact it's flawed at times. However,in it's complete uncut form it remains to be one of the most disturbing and shocking horrors I have ever seen. Although the depictions of animal cruelty are disturbing and sadly genuine, it still remains as a horrific element of a horrific film. Although I think that cruelty to animals is wrong, I put this aside while watching the film and concentrated on the affect that the director had in mind.Before seeing the film, I had been warned by numerous people that no matter how much I was sure I knew what I was in for, I still was going to be horrified. The opposite was the case when the opening credits rolled. The ""Different Strokes"" style opening music (don't ask, it's just what it reminded me of) got me in a good mood and I found the opening to be rather slow. Things naturally changed. This film isn't notorious for nothing! I don't wish to harp on about the different scenes of depravity and animal slaughter but it's necessary if one needs to see why director Ruggero Deodato decided to make his slaughter-fest in such a way. Why would a movie be made with such emphasis on the close up on the genuine dissection of an animal? In my mind it is the point of view that we are being shown that is relevant to the statement of the film. There is the obvious idea that the real monsters in the film are not the cannibal's but the filmmakers who rape and murder their way through the jungle, but one needs to look at what we are actually watching. It is the footage found of the filmmakers, therefore it is what they themselves thought would be the most interesting footage. I don't feel that the film is as horrific as the levels to which a human being can stoop for their own personal gain. This is the core of the film shock factor in my mind. The music although very dated, strikes a chord (No pun intended). The eerie eighties screeching synthesiser makes the images seem more horrifying as it is an inescapable atmosphere that the music wraps you in. The music during the most graphic scenes is a repeat from earlier in the film, it is the overture so to speak, and the repetition reminded me of a time less than a few short minutes ago where I was safely watching a normal gore-fest and had since then been thrown into this mad world of hedonism and evil.What was most unusual about my experience with Deodato's Holocaust, as it may be with yours' is that it took me some time to realize what I had just watched. Normally a film stays with you for some time, and this is no exception, but I walked out of the theatre knowing that I had just finished watching one of the sickest things ever, but it took time for the images to sink in. A few hours later, I felt exhausted, as if I had been on some odyssey of exploitation. Even for those of you who think your hardcore just remember, You have been warned.",Cannibal Holocaust

I was mislead into thinking this might be a really good movie.The acting is bad, I don't know why there are so many reviews saying that it is good. The camera shake makes it look like it's real, but you can tell at the first glance that it is not.The plot is weak and the violence is not what I expected, it is NOT BRUTAL, it's just something that might look brutal and have an impact, but in another movie, with a different crew.Basically, if you would take aside the animal killing (which is for real, it doesn't bring anything to the movie and is just disgusting - I don't know how some people can enjoy watching that), you would end up with a movie that doesn't make you feel anything.

At first you feel despise for the cannibals but then you end up hating the white guys.It's real intention wasn't to be scary, but to be shocking, and while watching it, I felt like it's gotten old, and as if it's lost that effect.

This film has reached mythic proportions.I sat down in front of the film, waiting to be floored by nightmare-inducing images and all I did was laugh for two hours at the poorly composed synthesizer background score. Don't get me wrong, the gore is fantastic, but the only terrifying thing about the film is the turtle mutilation scene. If you can't stomach cruelty to animals (and from what I understand, they ARE real animals) please don't watch this film.Interestingly enough, Deodato seems to afford more emotional weight to the beasts of the jungle than the humans that don't belong there. Moral of the story? I don't know. Some say the director is vilifying the violence portrayed in those jungles by the cultures that inhabit them, but if that's true, then all he achieves is a misplaced critique of indigineous peoples and their own set of ideologies and cultural norms.What I feel Deodato is most successful at is portraying the danger of ""outsiders"" penetrating an unknown world. In an attempt to expose the ""terrifying"" in said culture, ""Holocaust's"" fearless whitebread filmmakers (the main characters) make a swift transition into a much more horrifying world,committing those very acts they have set out to demonize: rape, cannibalism, and brutality.The whole time I was watching, while not busting my gut laughing, I thought about that Nietzschian warning: ""Whoever fights monsters should see to it that in the process he does not become a monster."" This it would seem, to me at least, was Deodato's thesis, or at best, the impetus behind creating a world of violence, no matter how his viewers or his critics translated that violence.",Cannibal Holocaust

Atrocities are committed all the time in history, but we don't think about it as much because we can't relate to history if we weren't there.Well this makes sure you know.Hotel Rwanda and The Boy in the Striped Pajamas are the only movies I've seen that have a similar theme: We think you are evil, but in reality we are more savage than you.Yes, the incessant animal cruelty was unnecessary.

387,Weevlitz,A Social Commentary?? Not quite.,4,8 September 2001,"Well, I must say that I have been in pursuit of this film for a long time and I finally got to watch it this evening.  I guess the feeling I'm having is an overall disappointment.  I'm not going to say that it is a horrible film, because it isn't.  However, I can not believe there are people that feel this is a masterpiece....some of you even go so far as to say that it is the greatest film of all time!  You must not get out too much, or you spend too much time watching horror films.Now where to begin...let's see...first of all I don't really find this to be a horror film at all.  I was more frightened pressing play(due to all the hype) than i was throughout the entire film.  In fact...I was NEVER scared. Sure, I was repulsed by a lot, that's a given, but because something is sick and twisted doesn't make it horror.  Hell, what about American Pie, or There's Something About Mary?  Sick and twisted comedies...very good one's I might add!  Anyway, back to the task at hand...I dunno, maybe I'm just too picky, but I like my horror movies to scare me...at least once.The biggest problem with the film is that the victims...the four film makers...are not likeable at all.  They're not funny, they're not attractive, they're cruel, and basically reminded me of drunk fraternity brothers with their sorority slut.  That being said, I was glad when they were killed...they deserved it.  Now, many people are saying that this was the point of the film...""Who are the real Cannibals.""  Please....if you want to buy that and it makes the film work for you then that's great.  I'm happy....but it doesn't work for me.  As a member of a society, I am truly offended that these four heartless schmucks are supposed to be representative of us!  I don't know ANYONE that would charge a group of KNOWN CANNIBALS and start burning their huts down!  I know many filmmakers, as I am an actor...none would do what these people did.  So right there all validity of this message is lost.  That being said, let's think about  how this movie should have gone.Let's say we don't make these characters ridiculous stereotypes of filmmakers who will do anything to strike it rich...sorry folks...that's a myth....when it comes to being eaten alive...any filmmaker will not...well I don't need to tell you that.  So, make these characters likable...make them TRULY victims...not jerks who got what they  deserved.  Let's have them filming these tribes from a far...captured...held captive for weeks while still allowed to get footage, and then ultimately...one by one...for footage sake...are murdered.  Then, you could bulk up your media types that want to release it...you could make them more the bad people....they were on their way to being the bad guys, until you actually see the filmmakers.  So you see where i'm going....if the people who actually are killed are cared for by the audience...then we have a reason to identify with them and be frightened..thus the essence of good horror.On a positive note, the score...while repetitive, is very effective.  I jokingly said that I would buy the soundtrack...however, in it's simplicity, the main theme is very haunting and works well.  It's just a shame that ithad to be wasted on a mediocre movie.One last thing....I've avoided the animal issue until now.  I am a meat eater!  I like my steaks and hamburgers medium rare.  I appreciate the sacrifice that animals make to feed and cloth us.  But I am sorry, there has to be a line drawn when it comes to entertainment.  So the animals were to be food for the natives...fine..then let the natives do what they must in order to feed themselves and live their lives...but do not use this as an opportunity to try to entertain.  Those that find blatant animal cruelty entertainment, then I guess this is the movie for you.  The fact that the animal cruelty was real does nothing for the films story.  In fact it TAKES AWAY FROM THE FILM'S STORY.  A fictional story is just that...fictional...I am not impressed by the mutilation of a turtle...now...if it was fake...I might have been impressed...but anyone can do what they did.  It's just wrong...and anyone who defends it as necessary for the film is someone that seriously needs to re-evaluate themselves as a human being.
I'll tell you...it would have been better if the animals were spared and the actors really killed!  So...in a nutshell...Cannibal Holocaust contains the following:-Interesting concept -Good cinematography(Some of the amazon shots are beautiful) -Good Score(Very haunting, and very appropriate) -Bad acting...all around...nobody is good. -Horrible dubbing...it looked like they were mouthing english..so what the hell? -Pretty good special effects(The cannibal scenes did look real...well most of them) -Unnecessary animal cruelty(Does not help the film) -Bad Story(Would have worked better if the main characters weren't scumbags) -No Scares(Just gross-outs....SERIOUS gross-outs) -Mediocre direction(Although with those actors...not a lot to work with...it's not hard to figure out why these people never became famous)All in all...a dud.  If you want to be shocked and disgusted...then this movie will do if for you...the animal scenes...the cannibal scenes..and the acting should handle that for you.  If you want a commentary on society, dont' see this. IF you want to be frightened...don't see this.  If you want a good film...don't see this.4 out of 10",Cannibal Holocaust

It's in your face, it at least seems real (and is real in some parts). Never have I ever seen such convincing special effects in a movie and this was a low-budget 70s movie, CGI will never recreate it. But beyond the special effects there is a message and meaning and very engaging story.I'll break down the review into sections.Plot/story (9/10): Think of The Blair Witch Project, except not trying to put itself off as real. A group of 4 documenters go into the amazon jungle to film the ""savages"" and cannibals that live there. They do not return and it is up to an anthropologist to find them or at least what was left of them. Throughout the movie we learn of the documentary crew's tendency to push and bribe people into committing extreme acts of violence through actual footage from people being killed by soldiers in Nigeria. The movie portrays it as if it was a documentary shot by the crew in which they payed the soldiers off to kill innocent people execution style. As the story progresses the viewer is forced to try and comprehend who exactly are the real savages. Not to mention the social overtones of how modern society ties into all of this. It loses a point, though, because the dialog sometimes is very iffy, even though you can tell they were trying to be realistic, but this hinders the actors, especially with their lack of experience.Acting (7/10): This is where the movie suffers. It gets better as the movie progresses and things get more intense (this may be do to the actual moralities of the actors and how they felt about the movie showing through in their characters). But when it starts out, I'm almost reminded of campy b-movies. The cinematic presentation and pure intrigue is what kept me going. Again, though, the script writing obviously provided some challenges for the actors.Cinematography (10/10): Speaking of cinematic presentation, this movie does it beautifully, even from the opening shot from a helicopter flying over the rain-forest. The studio and movie-style aspects of the film are very convincing and very well-done. Hollywood couldn't do better with a 10 million dollar budget. The creativity and use of close-ups really pulls you in, and you begin to question the reality of even the part of the movie that is presented as fictional. And that doesn't even cover the great mockumentary work. The director's understanding of how documentaries are made and how they work is extremely convincing. the use of normal scenes of the crew kind of doddling around really help to present a feeling of reality. And the aspects of limited film and the amateurish/spontaneous filming style are almost convincing enough to make the viewer think they used real footage to build a fictional movie around.Audio (10/10) Again, I'm reminded of Apocalypse Now. The music is melodic and somewhat peaceful, adding a real eerie tone to the serious and macabre theme of the movie. It is very 70s though, and I would not expect to here the same soundtrack in a new movie, although some of the musical flavors are indeed timeless. And there are some more intense scores in the film, but they are not over-intense like most Hollywood today. Then we get into sound design, which is very convincing, the tearing and the screaming all sound real, or as I would expect them to sound. The new mixing with stereo is well and really helps immerse the viewer.On the animal violence: This is something that I thought would disturb me. The animal scenes in Amorres Perros disturbed me even though they were not real, but this was real and I wasn't that perturbed by them. People have said that the killing of the animals is useless and doesn't help the plot of the movie, but I feel otherwise. It brings into light that you do have to kill to survive. The documenters kill 6 animals (one is a spider, which some may not count, I do) on screen and 1 is killed off screen. And it obviously irks the actors a little bit (note: when you see vomit, it is indeed real). But the animals are eaten. And all of this adds to the reality of the documentary. It would have been hard fake some most of that. Plus, think of the meat industry today. Hundreds of thousands of cows and pigs slaughtered and millions of chickens and turkeys slaughtered every day in gruesome ways, just so we can eat them. ""Just because you don't see it, doesn't mean it doesn't happen"". Our society frowns upon killing animals, but that burger doesn't magically appear. Blood had to be spilled for our dining pleasure.",Cannibal Holocaust
398,fakeokblue,A Cannibalistic Masterpiece!,10,12 November 2007,"Wow, What can I say about this outstanding film? Well to start, It is definitely not meant for kids for there is many sex and nude scenes throughout the film and no, its no just the cannibals. There are also rape scenes which is definitely something a kid should not watch. This is the most violent and disturbing movie I have viewed, but it is not something to vomit over. Of course, I never thought anything was disgusting, From faces and traces of death, to faces of gore, I've seen them all. Still, If you are new to extremely violent films, I suggest you start out a little less then this one. The deaths are so realistic, I couldn't tell the difference if you told me it was real death scenes. The gore is way surpass its time of 1980, The director must of worked night shifts to make that gore look so realistic. The movie also has a nice and easy to follow plot. You can never get bored with this movie, You will find yourself watching the whole film even if you cant take the gore. So to sum it all up, I recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 18, maybe even 16. Younger then that, I really don't think this film is something for you to watch.",Cannibal Holocaust
399,bambilola90,CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST: a haunting film with a damn good storyline,9,27 February 2009,"Wow! What an amazing and original film.I had heard about this film once when looking up ""snuff films"" on the internet to see if any actually existed. The director of Cannibal Holocaust, Ruggero Deodato, was arrested upon making it and charged with the murder of the main characters. He had to actually bring the actors to court to prove to everyone that it was not a snuff film! (though it was for two squirrel monkeys, a turtle, a coatimundi, a snake, a spider and a pig).I was very scared to watch this film! But once it began, and the gruesomness started, it was like being on a ride, i could not get off, I had to see what happened next.It is a simple enough storyline. A group of young documentary filmmakers go on an expedition to the heart of the Amazon in search of primitive cannibal tribes in which to make a documentary. They never return, but their footage is found. The film actually has quite a strong message. For most of the film we wonder what must have happened in the jungle for the group to be murdered so savagely by the natives. By the end of the film, we realize that their gruesome and violent demise at the hands of the natives is just revenge for what they inflicted upon the natives. Alan Yates and his crew had been ""savaging"" the savages, murdering and even raping for the sake of sensationalism in their ""documentary"". The found footage ends up not being a documentary on the savagery of the natives, but an exploration of the cruelty of the ""civilized"" world, and how far they will go to get a good story. They had gone to the jungle in search of a story, and failing to find one interesting enough, had created terrible situations in order to film them. Afterwards I actually had to look up how the special effects were achieved so that I could believe that the human deaths were not real. It is quite a short film, just over an hour, and actually has a pretty damn good story line, and a good message too. It is a graphic commentary on sensationalism in documentaries, and I am glad that I saw it, though it is not for the faint hearted and is quite disturbing. the only thing that really upsets me in the film is that there was actual animal cruelty, it felt perverse to put that in a film, as part of entertainment. The last line of the film is sad and thoughtful. Harold Monroe (who found the groups footage) having just watched the footage again, walks out of a building and says with defeat in his voice, ""I wonder who the real cannibals are..."" the music for this film is also amazing. It doesn't have the cliché tribal drumming that a cannibal film easily could have gotten away with. The music is beautiful and ironic and compliments the films dark themes and gory images in an almost sardonic way. More horror films should have music like this. I give this film nine stars out of ten, because it got its point across, I am still thinking about it, and, despite some minor qualms about animal cruelty, it is really a fantastic film and I will watch it again some day, but perhaps not for a while. I would recommend this film to those who have not recently eaten lunch.",Cannibal Holocaust
400,polson-13,I need a cleansing,1,16 February 2008,"Watching this clumsy, ham-handed attempt at movie-making was a vile and regrettable experience. Anyone who claims a shred of cinematic merit for this bucket of swill needs his or her head quite thoroughly examined. Every reel, every cell of this firm should be incinerated -- an irony considering a comment made during one scene. The making of this movie affirms every base and cruel value which the film attempts to ""portray."" Watching it has made me complicit in something truly disgusting. The only good thing about watching this abomination is that I downloaded it illegally; paying for it would have been money better spent on a diuretic.

401,mjmelia2002,A Genuinely challenging film,9,11 December 2006,"This film was far from what I expected. Having held out for many years against watching it (mainly on account of the terrible animal killing that goes on in it), i finally plucked up the courage to watch the uncut version of Cannibal Holocaust.How surprising to find not a cheap and nasty exploitation film (which sometimes is no bad thing!) but a genuinely moving, urgent and powerful piece of film making which reflects on the nature of Western attitudes to nature.The camera never shys away from showing you the mutual brutality of primitive and civilised man, asking the question, have we in the west really evolved as much as we think? Yes, the imagery is shocking, brutal and extreme containing scenes of an enforced primitive abortions, male castration, the terrible fate of a tribal girl accused of adultery. The cruelty and brutality of the tribes (graphic as it is) never seems as shocking as the violence carried out by the team of journalists who go into the 'Green Inferno' as they burn, rape, and mutliate their way through the bush. The camera never once urges you to enjoy the events, but it is a powerful way of gauging your own reatcions to what is happening on screen, as first we follow a university professor into the jungle as he attempts to discover the fate of the four young journalists, (he himself is forced to take part in a cannibalistic act), the second half we see events through the cameras of the journalists filtered through the reaction of the TV execs in a screening room, watching the amateur footage.I felt the film was a graphic but sober meditation on the nature of civilised man, a film whose power comes in part through its haunting and powerful score (which should be available on CV). Lush, soulful strings accompany the images of a young girl, previously raped by the journalists, impaled on a stake prove quite jarring yet impact the image powerfully in the mind of the viewer.Finally, some mention has to go to the famous animal killings. These over the years have provided Cannibal Holocaust with its reputation as the most horrific film of the genre. These scenes are barbaric and ultimately pull the film down. However I believe a cut is available without these scenes in.This aside, i was hugely surprised by this movie, and would recommoned it to the strong of stomach. It is a horror film like no other of its type, genuinely moving, tragic, sad yet extreme, brutal and violent.",Cannibal Holocaust
402,cryptictac,Overrated but not without some interesting concepts,5,22 June 2009,"This is your typical 70s/80s-cusp independent, low budget movie: actors you've never heard of, questionable acting, poor dubbing in parts, B-budget effects and camera work. The only difference is this film is an exploitation film, which is a genre of film that promotes exploiting shocking or lurid subject matter. Such films always end up with a notoriety to their name and often way overrated as a result.The first and foremost thing about exploitation films is they are usually grossly stereotypical. In ""Cannibal Holocaust"", cannibalism is exploited by means of setting up the stereotypical idea of what a cannibal is - an uncivilised and undiscovered tribe hidden in the depth of a jungle, each member with bones through their noses and always portrayed as complete savages. The cannibalism genre of exploitation films pretty much always follows the same formula. In the first half of this movie, we're aware that the tribes did something to the missing film crew but the audience given little clue as to what or why. We just assume they got eaten because the cannibal tribes are savages, the end. The first half follows Professor Monroe's expedition into the South American jungle to uncover the truth, cautiously befriending the tribe by means of assimilating himself into their culture. This leads him to the discovery of the strange totem-like shrine the Yanomamo tribe had erected with the missing film crew's body remains and filming equipment. He makes a bribery exchange with the tribe for the film and takes them back to America.Cue the second half of this film. This is where things get troublesome. The female executive of a news coverage empire wants to sensationalise the disappearances of the film crew by using the footage on the film to create a documentary uncovering the mystery of this undiscovered tribe. Professor Monroe begins viewing the material and slowly starts to piece together exactly what happened to the film crew. This is the interesting facet of the film - the social commentary on who the savages of society really are. The film highlights this quite well. However, it also goes to unnecessary extremes to highlight this, too. This movie includes actual animal torture and slaughter. A turtle is beheaded, dismembered and graphically disembowelled; a coatimundi is skinned alive; a spider and a snake are killed with a machete; a pig is executed with a rifle; a monkey is mutilated and beheaded. I have no issues with the concept of animal death in movies *if it's not actually real*. But this was real. Yes, it added to the ""realism"". Yes, it highlighted the point that civilised men are actually the savages as opposed to the uncivilised tribes. But it was unnecessary and very upsetting.As Professor Monroe views more and more of this footage, we are shown that the film crew destroyed the Yanomamo villages, raped their women, killed members of their tribe, basically executed an ambush that left this tribe who were supposedly completely unfamiliar with white man, terrified for their lives. Thus, the Yanomamo tribe eventually fought back out of survival and the film crew became their lunch. The cannibalism scenes were hardly graphic - well, not to me. I was expecting blood, gore, guts, the whole shebang, but all there was to be seen was innards being pulled out of obvious dummy/doll cadavers. I suppose the likes of more grisly gore hound/horror movies, as well as the many mind boggling things on the internet, have desensitised me. Plus, it's hard to be grossed out by the (fake) cannibalism after watching six animals being mutilated and slaughtered.In the end, after Monroe has finished watching the footage with the executives, they decide and agree that the footage be destroyed, as opposed to using it to sensationalise journalism and fabricate a story for the purpose of, well, sensationalism. Monroe's last words uttered before the credits roll: ""I wonder who the real cannibals are."" You could say this film is a social commentary on western, civilised society being the cannibals, or ""the rape of the natural world by the unnatural; the exploitation of others for Western entertainment"". I would say that's not an unfair commentary to make, because it's true. What *does* it mean to be civilised? It's an interesting question to ask.However, I dislike the fact that animals were slaughtered in the name of sensationalising this film. That in and of itself is hypocritical - the film slams sensationalism of the media and of the Western world raping the natural world, yet involved animal killings in the name of that exact same sensationalism. Apparently, director Ruggero Deodato regrets ever making this film nowadays, or at least regrets including the murder of actual animals. And so he should. I couldn't watch those scenes. They upset me immensely. The sexual violence was upsetting, too, though I understood its purpose to the plot.This film is not art. It is not deserving of five stars or of critical acclaim. It is, in my opinion, an overrated movie but with interesting concepts. It is not the gore fest many would have you believe - animal cruelty aside, it's actually a pretty tame movie. Then again, back in the day when this was released, it would've been considered extremely graphic. Times have changed a lot in the horror genre of film (though, I hesitate to call this a horror movie - more of an exploitive cult movie, I guess). Don't believe the hype about this movie; this is a film for the morbidly curious rather than because it's actually worth watching.",Cannibal Holocaust
403,orange-zombie,Disturbing? Yes! Did I like it? Of course!,9,27 May 2009,"I really enjoyed watching this movie. I felt inclined to take a peek because I have heard around the web that some believed it was in fact a snuff film. It was pleasing to the eyes how realistic the filming of this movie was. Although I do not condone animal abuse, I thought it was a really fascinating event to watch. People still hunt and kill animals for food to survive, and although the director didn't mind the real animal slaughtering, it was a good view on how savage people are. I didn't really find the original film crew who we watched most of the time too great of people. The men were too money hungry, but again isn't it just human nature? Alan had a disgusting personality and it added to the extremity to the film. Cannibal Holocaust was intensely disturbing and wrong, and it made me love it even more. I hold this movie one of the best ever made. Every scene that showed the suffering of humans, you really felt it. I can't believe how well it came out. Even knowing that the movie wasn't real, I had that question in my head, ""How can those actors make everything so real? They can't be actors,"". After watching this movie I was became apprehensive that I would not be able to enjoy any other horror film, because nothing can top this masterpiece.",Cannibal Holocaust
404,FrozenFireBalls,An Exercise in Cruelty,10,27 October 2009,"As ready as I thought I was to deal with ""the most controversial movie ever made"", after viewing this ""masterpiece"" it was quite apparent that I was not whatsoever prepared. Before even trying to collect my thoughts on what I had just seen, I consulted the mirror to see what my eyes said about the experience. I looked about as enthused as that muskrat must have felt.I have known about and wanted to see this movie for the longest time, so when I saw that Amazon.ca had it in stock, I felt a purchase necessary. Thankfully I decided to view it online beforehand to see if it was really worth my money. Thank Jesus i didn't waste my hard-earned cash on this vile piece of garbage.Now before I get into WHY i hate this movie, I must point out that it does have a few things going for it. For one, the cinematography (especially in the second half) does a marvelous job of making the viewer feel uneasy. Secondly, the musical score is quite remarkable, and the manner in which it is juxtaposed with scenes of extreme cruelty is genius, and makes the film that much more unsettling. And i guess the story is interestingly told for the most part. But that's where the good ends, and the nausea begins.Honestly, except for the fact that almost every woman shown on screen is inevitably raped, the human violence did not bother me that much. In fact, it seemed to be of the level of most gore oriented horror films of the time - nothing to write home about. However, the animal violence is SO immensely vile that I think it sabotages the entire film, and does not make the human violence any more realistic. As for the crew members and natives supposedly eating the animals they killed - that is a lame excuse for what went down, as it's not so much the fact that seven animals were killed 30 years ago for a film that bothers me - its the loving detail in which this cruelty is captured on screen. The voyeuristic camera lingers on the deaths of the animals, yet most of the other significant violence is committed off screen. This might have fooled people back in the day, but it does nothing more than prove that Deodato was a lazy bastard who had no regard for life today.I suppose in lieu of my response I cannot recommend this film to any one with a clear conscience. Even if you are a horror fan, I don't think this is a must see. I certainly wish I'd never seen it. But if curiosity gets the best of you like it did me, make sure for the love of god not to spend any money on it. I am confident that you would regret such a decision.",Cannibal Holocaust

406,jtsackett,An Absolute Masterpiece.,9,8 April 2004,"****SPOILERS AHEAD***** No other cannibal film or horror film for that matter has as much originality as Cannibal Holocaust. Sure, the name of the film could have been better, but the movie itself is in its own league. This film paved the way for A LOT of cannibal films and Euro exploitation films in the late 70's and early 80's. If you look closely at the plot of the movie you can tell that it also paved the way for The Blair Witch Project in 1999. The gruesome story of 4 film makers disappearing into the hell of the jungle, never to return is something as real as the disturbing images in this movie. REAL animal deaths, tons of blood and gore, castration, a fetus ripped from it's mother's womb, rape, torture, pretty much all the ingredients necessary for a disturbing and very controversial movie.Legend has it that even director Ruggero Deodato had to prove to the courts that the human deaths were fake, even bringing the actors and actresses before the courts to show them they were alive. What a powerful film this is and the reality of it all makes the film believable. For we know cannibalism is real and there are tribes in the darkest of jungles that feast on human flesh. This unnerving thought is portrayed brilliantly in this film. Riz Ortolani's stunning score has yet to be matched in any horror film. The beautiful serenading orchestra music as villagers are burnt to a crisp in a hut. The sad, dark violins and stringed instruments churn in almost a sorrowful manner as a woman is tortured to death for committing adultry.All together Deodato knows his craft well in Cannibal Holocaust. It is something you must see once in your life to experience it. For weak stomached, easily disturbed, or faint of heart do not even attempt to see this film. I would like to see Hollywood put out something as realistic and powerful and potent as Cannibal Holocaust. Good luck.9 out of 10",Cannibal Holocaust
407,eye_on_the_wall,Rabbits in the Sky,2,19 October 2007,"The plot & supposed morality of this film are as schizophrenic, obnoxious & unintelligent as its pitiful soundtrack, which is in itself an atrocity. Beginning with some actually decent but rather dull guitar muzak, it then randomly shifts from orchestra to various other instrumentations. None of these permutations seem related to each other or what's going on on screen. The exception being what I call the 'gore theme,' which chimes in to let everyone know when something is about to be disemboweled.The 'genius' of this film is supposed to be its realism, yet it is not realistic in any meaningful sense. The only thing that seems realistic is the depiction of violence, which with the animals is real. If something is real, how can if be credited with realism? The violent scenes involving humans don't look real at all. People get shot and just fall over; there isn't even blood. In one scene, a woman is being cut from her throat to her pelvis & it looks like all they did was rub paint on her. Besides the animal killings, the only aspect of the film that seriously establishes any realism is that it is actually filmed in the jungle, which again begs my earlier question. Since when do directors get called clever because they shoot on location? It's as if the animal killings are thrown in to shock people into not questioning the laziness or absurdity of the films' other elements.The supposed 'message' of the film makes even less sense. If the director is so passionate about showing the viciousness of modern western society, then why didn't he do any research? The film makes no attempt at fact checking whatsoever and will immediately be seen as a complete distortion by anybody with even a Sesame Street understanding of Anthropology. Again, where is the realism? When the film ended I watched the interview with the director hoping to hear some sort of elucidation of the film's thin attempt at social commentary, but all he talked about was minutia like how much money it made, how much was spent on it & where the actors are now. He seemed like a blockhead.Altogether, the film comes across as a shameless, cynical & jaded play on people's knee jerk reactions to reap the profits of controversy.",Cannibal Holocaust

I liked this movie a lot, and since his rating here is 6, I needed to find out why it is so low, so I read many user's comments. Non of them didn't mentioned that this movie is about capitalistic society. When professor talks to the lady from TV network he says something like: ""Would you like people to make money of your misery?"" that reminded me of a quote from Carl Marks ""Capital"" in which he says: ""Capital is a vampire that sucks out the life from the worker."" And that is exactly how capitalist society works. Workers are forced to work much for small wage cause they have family to feed, they get only the small piece of what they earn, and the rest goes to capitalist who gets richer and richer every day. The other thing that made me to think this way is that at the end when professor say the last line: ""I wonder who the real cannibals are?"", camera focuses on the skyscrapers that somehow reminded me of the pyramids that were build on the suffering of the slaves. The 3rd thing is that Alan and his documentary crew is literally eaten by their desire for money, success and fame,cause modern society force you to wish for these thing and don't leave alternative for happiness and self-satisfaction.So we must ask ourselves who are the real savages. Are they the jungle people who will kill a man for food or the ones who byes 50 million $ yacht while millions of people starve to death?When this movie was made this wasn't such a big problem but today we must think how to force the big companies to cut their profits in order to save environment or we all might soon be eaten by desire for progress and profit.

I am not trying to display swagger and bravado and ""Huh, I've got an iron stomach and ""nothing fazes me"" attitude, but I felt that all of the violence was completely in context with the storyline. I didn't think any of it was gratuitous, all of the nudity and violent acts had a place in the story; it was relevant to the subject matter. Even the animals which were killed, I didn't think it was done in a ""macho"" way-once again, I felt that those scenes belonged there. I hope I don't appear insensitive, because I am not, I will shed real tears over RSPCA stories of animal abuse, as well as being a contributor to animal(and people!)charities. I think thats the difference here, the animals were used (as food it would seem), and not ABused, which is where the difference lies. Overall, the film is quite good, no way deserves all the sensationalism it got (gets?), there are far more gory and gratuitous things on ogrish.com, and I definitely think the crew(in the film) deserved everything they got-what a reprehensible bunch they were!!

414,johngimble,"Bleak, unrelenting horror",10,7 May 2006,"Cannibal Holocaust. This is it, people. The holy grail of extreme cinema, the apex of exploitation. All avid film buffs- particularly those with an interest in horror- hear of this notorious exercise in cinematic depravity sooner or later. What makes it so infamous? Where to begin...The plot is simple. A group of American filmmakers, seeking to study primitive peoples, have vanished into an area of the Amazon Basin inhabited by two warring cannibal tribes. NYU anthropologist Harold Monroe is sent to investigate, and this is where our film begins.Professor Monroe (played by porn star Robert Kerman) is justifiably shocked by the cruel rituals of the natives, but earns the cautious friendship of the secretive 'Tree People' when his band drives away their enemies. He shortly discovers the missing film crew- what's left of them, at any rate- along with their footage.From here on out, Holocaust becomes a grueling endurance test, as the viewer is assailed by gruesome imagery and scenes of unimaginable violence. The adventurers are shown to be sociopaths who crudely hack off their guide's leg when he gets bitten by a snake, eagerly filming his death; burn down a village, roasting many of the inhabitants alive; gang-rape a young girl and smirk at her terrible fate. The film does a marvelous job of turning the viewer against them.The cannibals wreak terrible vengeance in the climax, and Deodato pulls no punches. Castration, decapitation and rape are among the acts committed against the vile crew, and all are graphically depicted. Are we supposed to cheer their arguably justified revenge, or condemn it as the monstrous act it is? Or are we simply meant to cringe at the grotesquerie of it? The film closes with a troubling (if not exactly subtle) thought, voiced by Monroe- 'I wonder who the real cannibals are'. This is the film's raison d'etre, the message it is trying to purvey. The 'uplifting forces' of civilization haven't eradicated our darker impulses, which can emerge under the right circumstances. There are those who say the 'deeper meaning' was simply tacked on to justify a morally reprehensible exploitation film. Undoubtedly, there is at least some truth in this criticism. Regardless, it remains unsettlingly relevant today, over a quarter of a century after its release. Moving on to the technical aspects, the cinematography is nicely done. The faux-documentary footage is appropriately shaky and scratched, immersing the viewer into the world of the 'Green Inferno'. Riz Ortolani's score is simply magnificent, ranging from soothing to harsh as needed. One of the best effects in the film is the juxtaposition of the placid theme with images of extreme violence, disorienting the viewer. The acting is generally solid (particularly when compared to the other Italian cannibal films), with Kerman giving an especially strong performance.It would be amiss for the film's most controversial aspect- the authentic animal killings- to go unmentioned. In particular, the butchering of the turtle is one of the most stomach-churning scenes in cinematic history. The suffering of the animals is terrible to see, although they weren't dispatched in 'cruel' ways. These scenes have the impact of a sledgehammer blow, and ramp up the intensity to almost unbearable levels. Needless to say, this is not for everyone. The violence is far too extreme for a mainstream audience, and the animal deaths turn a great many off. But for those who can stomach it, Holocaust is a disturbing look at the violence inherent in human beings. It isn't simply one of the best exploitation films ever made- it's a great horror film, period.",Cannibal Holocaust

416,dharris-3,"Vile content, but not realistic shocking violence",8,9 November 1999,"Well maybe it's because I've read so many reviews, but this movie didn't revolt me, or give me nightmares, and it certainly didn't get me anywhere close to throwing up.  After getting a copy, I watched up to the first ""scene"" with the ritual rape, then stopped the tape before it really started.  I figured I was at the top of the roller coaster hill about to take the plunge into 'extreme' cinema and decided to hold off until I was ""mentally prepared"".  So after about a week of the tape in my house, I finally went through with watching it..fully prepared to have my brain assaulted with images of ""holocaust"" proportions.  Then I see it.  What's the deal?  There's no orgie of grossness, or vile special effects showing some giant dildo tearing up a womens genitals.  You see a little blood between her legs after the mud ball and spikes bit, but thats it. Everything is implied, nothing explicit.  The cannibal dudes motion didn't even LOOK violent (obviously he didn't want to really hurt the actress). And the head crushing, come on...nothing.  This ""gentle violence"" continues throughout the movie, apparently to be passed off as ""hideous and shocking"". Sure, the animal violence is real, and I glimpsed at only about 50% of the turtle scene, but it played like just some kids killing and maiming an animal because they have low IQ's.Maybe I saw a cut version, but the only explicit scene is the dick severing. No graphic decapitations, no graphic eye gouge or native women playing with the guys head (where was this??).  And the cheesie scene with the guts wrapped in clothes pretending to be the guys body getting hacked apart was so obviously just that, totally fake, that even I felt I could have made the scene better.  At least tell the natives to hit the cloths harder and more violently since there ain't no one in it!  Whatever...All in all, I did actually like the movie, but not for it's supposed ""snuff"" footage.  The music playing while the documentary guys burned the native village was very effective.  The message WAS there, and a good one.  It effected me more than any of the violence.  The chick-on-a-stick scene, as it is referred too, was more than just a shock scene..in fact it wasn't really shocking (maybe because I knew it was coming though).  The scene was important to the movie's point, that the film makers were so desparate to get an award for their work they would fake their own reactions.
Anyways, I just don't think this movie has the realistic special effects it is said to contain.  There was just no real cutting, slicing, or hacking scenes which made you wince (or toss the cookie's).  The scene with a native on his/her back getting split down the center just looked like a lot of makeup with some natives ""gently"" drawing their rock hatchets up and down a body.  You never saw the blades actually CUTTING anything, or any BLOOD coming out during the cutting.  It was just a static gore scene, with native obviously pretending to be doing the cutting.  After I saw the scene, I was thinking ""....Oh...that's what they were suppose to be doing"". Cheeeesie..So much for the mighty Cannibal Holocaust as some mind destroying horror movie.If anyone thinks what I described was a CUT version, email me.  I purchased my ""Cult Videos"" title through an online auction, which apparently is UNCUT.",Cannibal Holocaust

418,Ghost420,Just because you CAN doesn't mean you SHOULD,2,12 June 2010,"When I heard that a movie made in 1980 called Cannibal Holocaust was one of the most controversial films ever made, it peeked my interest and I decided to check it out. After watching the movie I was disgusted and wondered how they were able to pull off such realistic violence for it's time. Scenes like an impalement and animals getting tortured and murdered appeared very real. And while I learned how the impalement was done by sitting on a bicycle seat, I was disturbed to find out the animal slaughters were not fake, they were indeed real. Why? Because the director could, that's why...Well just because you can doesn't mean you should. We're all capable of doing horrible things but should we? No, because we know it's wrong.It was just as easy to fake an animals death as it was to fake everything else in the film but it was shot deep in the amazon where there were no laws against animal torture and killings. So director Ruggero Deodato had several animals murdered for his own sick pleasure.The sad thing is people try to defend this film and say its message is about the medias love of violence for ratings. Either the director is a huge hypocrite (condemning violence in the media while killing animals for the purpose of a film) or viewers are missing the real message in this movie: Deodato wanted to unleash his vile fantasies in a movie and try to pass it off as meaningful.Deodato was trying to make us all sick, and in that way he has succeeded. So instead of a 1, I vote it a 2. But anybody who claims this is a meaningful movie has been manipulated by a disturbed hypocrite.",Cannibal Holocaust

I, like many of you, have seen many, many movies in my lifetime. No movie that I have ever seen has touched me the way that this movie has, nor offended me in the way that this movie has. This movie had to be made, and should not be censored of banned. History should be remembered by all, in every gory detail. Furthermore, what kind of half-wit would honestly think this was a snuff film, even after investigating it. Not to say that it wasn't some of the most convincing effects that I have seen.

422,brookshire-1,Questionable Daring,4,24 June 2006,"This is the sort of movie that people might hear about, but few actually see; therefore people who are familiar with one of its versions start to feel proprietary about its reputation: after all, what's the point of digging it up and sitting through this poorly edited, ridiculously acted, grind-house shock film disguised as self-reflexive subversive social commentary if you can't wax critical about its wonders? It's worth seeing for the spectacle if you have the stomach, but don't fall for the hype about its importance. If you've never entertained the notion that 'civilized people' can also behave barbarically, perhaps it will seem profound.As a mockumentary, it has little value, and some discussion about its breaking ground in this department is clearly overlooking Louis Bunuel's much better Land Without Bread.Instead of comparing it to a truly disturbing work like Wild At Heart, it is actually better compared to a movie like Saving Private Ryan.Much like Saving Private Ryan, one leaves the film with little doubt that an unscrupulous film maker has used the least pleasant regions of human experience in the service of his own career, dressed it up as art or culture, and let other people do the work of figuring out what it was really worth.Precisely like Saving Private Ryan, it is ultimately disappointing. People are made of meat, bone, and various sacks of juice. It is not all that hard to take apart a body, and the world can end for any of us in the least pleasant of ways, without remedy, at any time. It doesn't take a genius to figure that out, and it certainly doesn't take a genius to film it. It is something to see: you've never seen anything quite like it. If you want to get a fairly good idea of what happens when a human being gets taken apart either movie will be quite helpful.

424,iceman654,Not your usual cheesy 70s horror flick,8,4 July 2006,"Back in 2005 when I first read about Cannibal Holocaust right here on IMDb after starting my ""extreme movie"" quest, I decided to track down an uncensored copy of the movie. At the time it was one of those VERY RARE movies that you only heard about & never actually got to see.At the time, I had heard Australian customs WILL confiscate ANY copy of Cannibal Holocaust that finds its way to the boarder. So what Did I do? I had a look on eBAY to see if I could find a lucky chap which had successfully imported an uncut copy of CH into the country. To my surprise I found a copy straight away, there was an uncut, legit copy of the EC entertainment Deluxe Collectors edition for just $15AUD. I quickly chose the ""Buy Now"" option & wallah! I now owned one of the most violent, morally repulsive & downright sick movies every created.This year an UNCUT version was released here in Australia after a 25 year long ban. As an extra on the disc it even included the infamous ""INTACT VERSION"" of The Last Road to Hell sequence. Naturally I picked it up.Now to the good stuff; I've been now been collecting extreme/hardcore movies for over a year & I can tell you.....Cannibal Holocaust is STILL in my top 5 most disturbingly violent movies of all time. Why? As you've already heard the movie contains REAL animal killings, purposely done JUST for the movie, endless rapes, brutal violence & all that stuff right? You may think that a movie with such content would have no hope of actually being a decent movie right? Wrong. The movie follows the atrocities committed by a group of young doco makers in the Amazon jungle, most of the movie is footage in which they recorded whilst tormenting the jungles natives in an attempt to manipulate them so that they could get exactly the footage they wanted for the doco.Be prepared, it may sound simple but......Nothing like this has ever been done before & nothing will ever come close in the future. The sheer brutality of the violence, rape, animal cruelty & forced abortion promises to turn stomaches. Most people probably wouldn't even be able to finish the movie, so unless you're an extreme horror/gore fan such as myself then stay FAR FAR away.But don't get me wrong, there's more to CH then meets the eye. It's also an incredible movie with an important message but at heart it's still a hardcore, underground exploitation flick with BULLS!

The technologies and the clothing (or lack thereof) of the two groups are further compounding the contrasts between our societies. The culinary and social habits of the primitive cannibalistic society are supposed to disturb and anger a civilized individual but what follows shows that we're not all that different from the Amazonian tribal societies. We have anger, perversion, hate that are only enhanced by out technological capabilities. Who are the cannibals here? Another contrast could be noticed in the attitudes of the documentalists and the anthropologist who came in search of them. The anthropologist managed to win back the primitives' trust and good graces, because he was ready to lower himself to their simplistic level at which they could understand and accept each other. He came not to judge but to learn from these tribesmen. Ultimately he showed how the contrasting societies of our planet should deal with each other - not judge but accept, not hate but connect, not preach but bridge.",Cannibal Holocaust
429,bradpittsgf,Definitely not the most graphic movie of all time,5,5 March 2021,"I'm not a professional in any way and everything that I'm about to say is just how I feel and what I took from the film.I'm a huge fan of gory / disturbing / graphic films, it can be hard for that kind of content to really even phase me, so going into this hearing it was ""the most graphic film of all time"" gave me high hopes. However, it just didn't have that effect on me that I wish it could have had, and I'll go into detail about the various elements of the film that prevented that.The movie is called ""Cannibal Holocaust"" but it honest to God seemed like there was more animal torture than actual human torture, contrary to what the title made me believe. Most of the actual intense ""cannibalism"" just takes place in the last like, 6 minutes of the movie? And, in my opinion, it's not really anything I haven't seen before- but of course I watched it in 2021, whereas people who watched it upon its release in 1980 were definitely going to be more disturbed by it as that sort of CGI wasn't something that people were used to seeing (at least from what I've gathered from other reviews, I believe that's true) (also the fact that the found footage style made some audiences believe it were actually true). I'm sure that if I could experience it from that POV, the effectiveness would have been stronger for me. But unfortunately, I can't force myself to see it that way, although I almost feel like rewatching the movie just to really put myself in it and truly experience it the way it was intended.I briefly mentioned the animal torture / killings above, but it's of course a hot topic when it comes to reviewing this movie. It seems to be controversial, but in my eyes it doesn't take much thought- plain and simple, it's wrong. In addition to the fact that there were way more animal killings than necessary, using actual living animals who were there involuntarily and brutally taking their lives from them, and exploiting it for a MOVIE, is also completely unnecessary. If you could use special effects and whatnot to make literal humans appear to be murdered and cannibalized on screen, then WHY could you have not done that with animals. It's straight up horrific and crosses the line between it being a ""just a movie"" to being something that actually claimed the lives of living creatures. I know that the director has said he regrets it, but how someone could have such a lack of respect for life in the first place is beyond me.ALSO, not to mention the random & horrific r*pe scene where the characters are literally laughing and making the whole thing a joke?Although animal cruelty in film is something I will always try to avoid and will always upset me, it's obvious there was a reason for it in this movie. Unlike some movies where they randomly abuse or kill an animal for no reason, or for shock value, the animal deaths in Cannibal Holocaust helped further the story. As I saw in another review, someone said it shows that ""you have to kill to survive"" (which is not true in civilized society but definitely applicable to living in the jungle) and I feel that the killing and eating of the animals was important to the story development and introduced the important concept of killing for food and survival / foreshadowed what would later happen to the characters. But as I mentioned, I felt there were too many animal deaths than necessary, just a couple would have sufficed as a way to show what they did to survive. The killing of real animals was just cruel- it's a movie, no one should lose their life for it, whether it be human, animal, whatever. It just doesn't make sense.I can totally understand the cultural significance of the movie though, in that it basically introduced the found footage style, and I can understand the powerful effect it would've had for those seeing it when it was first released.I gave this movie 5/10, I think it is a well directed movie, great cinematography, interesting storyline, the music and main theme is beautifully remarkable & haunting, and plenty of aspects of the film do an incredible job at keeping the audience hooked.

People watch this due to it's infamy, not for the acting or plot- in my opinion, the anthropologist is the best actor and the only person I felt any sense of dimension from.Are there plot holes? Yes. It makes no sense why the documentarians are complete sociopaths, why the members of the broadcasting company are so... shallow, and I have no idea what happened to the guide at the start of the film. However I have heard there's a missing 5 minutes and 19 seconds of this movie that can only be seen if you watch the rare DVD copies. I hope the issues of the plot are explained in the extended version, which I will not watch.It isn't as difficult to watch as some of these ""most controversial movies"" for the fact that there's little psychological or mental torture, but rather complete physical brutality and inhumane violence.The message of the movie is commendable though, and speaks to the evil that is colonisation, as well as the irony of the white definition of a 'savage'.

Now that's a truly groundbreaking discovery, isn't it? And that's already the first, and major problem I'm having with this movie: only to show off how thin, or even non-existent, the layer of civilisation is, the movie utilises some (or, actually, a lot) of the worst racist clichés I've ever seen. It's as if all the fantasies of the 18th and 19th centuries with its black-and-white contrasts of the ""noble"" and the ""beastly"" savage have come to life, fantasies we should already know were a product of the ideas of western, of caucasian superiority. Granted, the movie tries to show (or, at least, claims to do so) the minimal difference, but nevertheless, depicting natives like that is racist to the extreme, as if cultures outside our civilisation had to be savage and cruel by default. Besides, does The Civilised Man really need to be out in the jungle to behave like a beast? The Holocaust part of the title alone should make you doubt that As to the animals being killed: No, I'm not a vegetarian, and yes, I know that the burger on my plate was once a cow which had been slaughtered, but I wouldn't get off killing them, or watching them being tortured; and I'd seriously consider changing the butcher if I found out that they were enjoying the act of killing. Hypocrisy? Burying my head in the sand? Maybe; but I think there's a crucial difference between not having problems with a fact (like, animals being killed to be served on my plate) and relishing watching and hearing them being tortured. The coatimundi's piercing screams of panic and agony, the spilled-out gutts of the turtle, the smashed spider (which turns the female scientist into a damsel-in-distress), etc., are, let's be honest, only included to add some real kinky stuff; they lack both dramaturgic (if the movie has any at all) and cultural relevance. Ritual slaughtering, be it Indian tradition or any other (e.g. Roman, kosher, halal, to stay within the boundaries of ""civilisation""), does NOT include gratuious cruelty, to the contrary. An animal slaughtered that messily would be considered impure; and I doubt a real Indian hunter would be that clumsy.

I'll give you a little background so I can point out my favoritely awful part.  The whole movie is premised on a group of students or some such thing that travel to the ""Green Inferno"" where two tribes of cannibals live. These students have gone other places doing documentaries and are supposedly world renowned.  One of the members of the ""team"" is a girl named Faye.  The ""team"" heads into the jungle and has a few run-ins with the wildlife (mostly them killing it with hatchets).  Then Faye screams and the camera turns to show a spider on her shoulder.

Now im not adverse to animals being killed in films when they are animatronic but this film took it to the extreme.I watched it just like I was a kid playing with a new toy and I really enjoyed it, it was only after I left my friends house and got thinking about it that I felt I had had my senses raped.

438,kimmysticks,Worse than expected,2,2 April 2008,"I first heard about this film only a couple of weeks ago. As a horror fan and a believer that there is not much left in the world that will shock me, I wanted to see it to find out what all the controversy was about. I went in knowing the basic plot and what I was going to see. I thought 'Either this movie is going to scar me for life, or it's going to be stupid as hell.' Well, I'm going with the latter.I realize this is an exploitation film and perhaps the whole purpose of it is to shock/disturb. So maybe you could say 'I should have known'. But after viewing it, I felt like I should be ashamed for watching such garbage. Not because of any moral code, an extreme sensitivity to 'bad' subject matter or anything comparable to that. I just feel like it was disgusting simply for the sake of being disgusting. And not even in a good way - as I can think of plenty of films that have grossed me out - but I still enjoyed them and felt they had some intrinsic value in the end. The film clearly had a point to make - having the viewer question who the real savages are. This could have been a powerful message, but it was lost due to the never ending onslaught of horrific scenes. I suppose that discussing world issues was not the main reason this film was made. But nonetheless I feel it comes across as contradictory to have a serious issue presented alongside such disgusting scenes, and it leaves you feeling as mixed up as you are sick.I am not an animal rights activist but I feel that the animal scenes were a bit much. I also thought the repeated rape theme was overdone. As an animal lover and a woman you might think these scenes bothered me simply because of those facts. But as mentioned, I think I am pretty open minded and not overly bothered by these subjects. But now and again a line gets crossed and even the most liberal person questions the taste of things.If there's one thing I've learned from this film, it's that this sort of cinema is probably not for me. I was going to give it one star but figure maybe two is more realistic (not that it matters much between the two). Deep down I feel I hated it, but I could see that it might have some enjoyment value for other people. I mean, there were times during the film when I just had to laugh at the pure insanity of what was going on. I guess that counts for something.",Cannibal Holocaust

I have watched horror movies since I was 7. I've seen everything there is to see, but nothing could prepare me for this.This is a masterpiece. Ten out of ten doesn't do justice for this film: 15 out of ten might be closer.

440,hinesadam,Unneccessary.....,1,3 May 2003,"I won't go over the plot for two reasons: One, the less you know about a horror film going in the better, and two, the plot is almost legendary by now so you've probably heard about it already. With that said, here's a very quick summary to get you started: Some people film a documentary, they disappear, the footage is found later and watched.This movie was disturbing. The deaths are realistically shot, and the grainy ""stock footage"" quality plus the believability of the situation makes it truly shocking and horrific. But that didn't warrant the ""1"" I gave it. Horror films (true horror films) are supposed to be shocking - that's their nature. Films that make people take, that force people to participate in debate because of their extreme nature, always are a good thing. Movies are there to provoke reaction. Anything less is failure on the part of the filmmakers.So, in that respect, it was a stirring success.However, there are scenes of animals being tortured, then killed. Now, this alone would have been fine, and would have added to the film's horror...had it been faked, like the deaths of the people. It wasn't. Every bit of animal torture and death is real. The animals died. All for a movie. And that's shocking for all the wrong reasons.So, I was forced to give it a ""1"", and if it was possible, a ""0"". People have made the argument that the pain and suffering incurred by the animals were warranted because of the pain and suffering that goes on in the wild everyday amongst the predators and their prey. This is a bad analogy. Predators kill and eat their prey because they have to. They need to kill and eat to live. The filmmakers tortured and killed these animals to make a 70's horror movie. See a difference? The fact that the tribe ate the animals afterward is inconsequential - it wasn't necessary. And if it's not necessary, there's absolutely no excuse.Horror movie lovers will undoubtedly like this film for it's uncompromising brutality. Logical minds who THINK about the real deaths won't.",Cannibal Holocaust

Now this was just truly disgusting and cruel. They did things to these animals that is so (I want to cry) horrible. I just think ""What was the unimaginable pain of that muskrat, or the turtle, or the monkey."" And f***ing a v*gin* with a wooden stake, WTF! Who sits down and comes up with this, and if you do, you don't film it. I love artistic movies like The Tracey Fragments and The Blair Witch Project, but this was by no means ""art"".

442,spradlings,Good film....just doesn't live up to the hype.,7,10 February 2009,"As a die hard horror and exploitation fan, I couldn't help but add Cannibal Holocaust to my list of viewing experiences. What was delivered was certainly not what was promised by the many reviews I had read. I am partly to blame for this since I made the rookie mistake of relying too heavily on marketing hype before viewing the film. As a result, my expectations were set too high. After it was over, I was literally asking myself: ""That was it?"" Honestly, I felt cheated in a way.However, in all fairness, Cannibal Holocaust is a good film with beautiful scenery, a unique plot for its time period, and one of the most electrifying musical scores in horror film history. Looking beneath the surface, the subtle social commentary is what should have been used to push this film rather than the "" all-out, in-your-face exploitation flick"" as it is currently labeled. Even the animal torture scenes weren't as shocking as I was led to believe. Although bad, I have seen worse in slaughter house footage. The message I took away from this movie is that despite how sophisticated our society has become, there still remains a primitive side to mankind that has yet to evolve. It forces you to re-think many of your political and social points of view.If you have yet to view Cannibal Holocaust, I would suggest you do not read the internet hype and view the film objectively. If you are looking for the hard-core gore fest, this film is not for you. For these fans, I would suggest the Traces of Death series (not to be confused with the inferior Faces of Death series). After you view these films, you will be jaded to anything you see from that point forward as this series holds nothing back. I purchased the Traces of Death box set a few years ago and anytime I need my reality ""gore fix"", I pop one of these into the DVD player. When it comes to exploitation, nothing beats the real thing. With that said, Cannibal Holocaust was seemingly ahead of its time on many aspects but for most, it is nothing you haven't already experienced.",Cannibal Holocaust

It was way before it's time. Blair witch even ripped some elements off of it. This movie completely captures the media induced stupor that was 30 years in the making. You can see shots at reality TV in this movie, and it had not even been conceptualized yet. The things that were done in this movie could not happen today, and that is a shame in the fact that if there was ever a time when a movie like this was relevant, it is upon us.DisclaimerI do not condone animal cruelty, I just think that this films impact would have hit harder if it came out today then in 1979. Why was I born in that year? Maybe that's an omen? Or probably just sheer stupid luck.

I did not find the murder of animals on-screen revolting or offending, but rather quite a will-taking thing to do (Yes, I have been to ""world of death"".com before). But, even though I liked this movie very much, there were things I hated about it.1: The sounds and effects of the shootouts at the beginning were AWFUL! There wasn't even blood! 2: Even though I can stomach most stuff, I did not like the fact that a woman vomiting FOR REAL on-screen because of the turtle dismemberment scene... I don't know why, but vomit anywhere just disturbs me far more than animal abuse. 3: Not as horrible as they say it is. The violence isn't as bad as, let's say, a Silent Hill or Saw movie. Most of it is on-screen, yeah, but when it's off-screen (Let's say, the raping scenes), it's NOT that bad!

446,angusrex357,What is there to say about this film that hasn't already been said?,5,31 October 2010,"This is not a movie that bears repeat viewings (well, not unless you have something really wrong with you.) I would watch ""The Human Centipede"" twice before I watch ""Cannibal Holocaust"" again. This is hands-down one of the most gut-wrenching movies I've ever seen. I took an antacid halfway through, just in case my stomach got the better of me. The strongest feelings of true disgust are elicited from the six (!!!) genuine animal killings in the film: a native boy amateurishly slits the throat of a screaming coatimundi, grinning Americans decapitate and disembowel a giant turtle, a squirrel monkey has its face cut off and brains eaten by natives, etc. This did not need to happen, although it does fill the viewer with a lot of animosity towards the Americans (not that the subsequent rapes don't do this equally as well without anyone actually getting hurt in the process), making their deaths less of a tragedy and more of a karmic public service.And then there are the rapes. There were at least 3 by my count. That is waaaay more than my yearly recommended intake of rape scenes. Needless to say, the fact that these were fake didn't make them any easier to stomach. I rarely have to look away from a movie, but I broke that rule tonight. Ugh Despite the good special effects (please god, tell me that guy didn't really get castrated with a rock), the rest of the production was borderline awful. The sound was off a lot of the time and the acting was shoddy at best. This could easily be attributed to the ""found film"" aspect, but the segments that weren't ""found"" were just as bad. Then again, what do you expect from a low-budget Italian exploitation movie from the 80s? Bad production is just par for the course.As posited by many critics, I can see the film as heavy-handed social commentary about ""civilized"" society. The most vile acts perpetrated in the film were at the hands of the American film crew, who went into the jungle to document the savage ways of the cannibalistic tribes. The cannibals in the film are portrayed as simplistic jungle people, so their actions, while horrifying (the adultery-shaming scene comes to mind, plus the whole cannibalism thing), are excusable. The actions of the Americans, however, are in spite of everything they have been taught by society. Thus we see how uncivilized the ""civilized"" truly are. The aforementioned heavy-handedness comes primarily from the last line of the film, ""I wonder who the real cannibals are."" (In case, you know, all the rape and murder in the last 90 minutes didn't spell it out clearly enough for you.) While the social commentary somewhat redeems this nasty, short, brutish thing of a film, the generally low production quality, bad acting, and copious unstaged animal killings are sure to turn off all but the morbidly curious. Don't watch this movie unless you really feel like you need to see it. It shouldn't interest all but the most hardcore of horror fans (who have probably already seen it), but if you are just getting into extreme horror movies, go for it. Nothing I can say will deter you anyway.",Cannibal Holocaust

But I am telling you, Cannibal Holocaust is in a class all it's own (well it probably fits in with the other extremes like this but I digress). Nothing you have seen will prepare you for this. If your looking at my review chances are your probably debating whether to watch this movie or not. The only people I would recommend this movie to is horror fans who want to test what their able to handle. I'm a huge horror fan who wanted to quench his sick thirst with some of the most gruesome and freaky movies over the Halloween weekend. Admittedly i'll just say I was not ready for this.It's actually funny how I came across CH. I was in the hostel 2 forum reading about what people had to say about it (i've already seen that). Then I came across a poster who said he was glad that he had seen the scariest movie ever finally(lol). Then someone posted back to him ""are you serious"". He then replied ""you know something worse"". Little did I know his recommendation would scar me for the rest of my life.The story is about a anthropologist who (foolishly) sends 3 reporters to a jungle to find the other reporters who didn't come back. Needless to say I forgot the rest of the story because for the last 3 1/4 of the movie i was fighting back vomit.Don't get me wrong it is a good movie for what it is. The director did a great job at making the story something that you could actually understand. The actors while i must say do a alright job in this movie they have to be downright f***ing crazy to even be in such a human disgrace like this. I do applaud them however cause I swear you will never in your life see a-list(or b for that matter) actors and actresses in a movie like this.

There are extreme torture scenes that regardless of your gender will leave you with your mouth hanging open, hands clutching your chest, and your mouth repeatedly saying oh my god.

Instead I traumatized myself with this horrifying beast of a film.The rape scenes are numerous and extraordinarily graphic. But much much more disturbing to me were the animal killing scenes. I cannot understand how any reasonable human being would be able to watch those scenes. I had to turn away or just skip to the next DVD chapter each time. The turtle and coatamundi scenes have plagued me since I watched them.I use IMDb daily and have never before felt compelled to write up a review here.

As I said, I am a fan of gore and an extremely liberal person - but this film impacted me like no other I've ever seen.

451,metathedemon,"Pretty impressive, but careful who you watch it with",6,28 January 2012,"Ahhh, the infamous Cannibal Holocaust. First off it's pertinent (not to mention obvious) to note that this film is NOT for everyone. Those friends you have who cite Halloween or Texas Chainsaw Massacre as the goriest, most effed up films they've ever seen.. Do NOT expose them to this movie. They will likely never speak to you again. That being said, I loved this movie but have some glaring problems with it. I felt that the animal slaughter scenes were perfectly fine and can respect the realism of them given that these animals were supposedly fed to the actual natives as happens everyday in the rain forest, so the acts themselves I do not consider gratuitous. However, I do feel that the way in which these killings were filmed and focused on bordered a bit on the verge of disaster porn. The ""muskrat"" killing, though somewhat benign compared to the others, seemed particularly egregious. Closeup of squirming animal with a knife through its throat, squealing and convulsing. Wait for it to die. Scene over. It was just unnecessary in my opinion and could've been portrayed with a bit more tact. However, this is modern man trekking into the wilds to essentially reconnect us all with what we come from, and this is beyond commonplace in nature. The acting was not as bad as I expected, though some scenes truly were awkwardly performed. The viewer I assume is to believe that these film makers, after being exposed to harshness of the jungle descended into barbarism, which was magnified by their programing from growing up in the calloused society of Western civilization. Unfortunately the acting just was not there. I found myself scratching my head as the atrocities became greater and greater while the actors conversed as if they were walking in the park on a rather mundane day. And not in an eerie sociopathic sort of way.. more of a ""We don't have much of a range as actors"" sort of way. That being said, this is a brilliant film if taking into account what they had to work with. The juxtapositions of commentary about ""The Green Inferno"" paired with shots of NYC, the by and large convincing gore, the iconic impalement scene, the very convincing look of the found footage and the overall message of civilized man being just as barbaric but in less overt ways were nothing short of very impressive in my opinion. I finished this movie much more impressed than I expected, thinking it would be nothing more than a fake snuff film that relied on animal cruelty for shock value.

Truly, the only two things truly disturbing about this flick are the animal killings, and the appalling atrocious acting, directing and writing. First, there was absolutely no need to have actors kill real animals. This is hack work (both literally and figuratively) at its absolute worst, at the sacrifice of defenseless beasts. Watching a turtle get decapitated and eviscerated does not fall into the category of enjoyable viewing for me.As for everything else in this film, what a crude, barbaric, amateurish attempt at film-making. People talk about the special effects as being so convincing. I was so convinced, in fact, when I saw the cannibals blatantly miss stabbing the girl with their spears that I would have laughed, had I not been so awestruck by just how pathetic this movie is. And why oh why are these ""documentarians"" out to destroy villages, kill innocent villagers and rape women? Aren't documentary makers supposed to avoid interacting in the fates of their subjects? The four filmmakers were so obnoxious and downright cruel and evil, that I actually enjoyed when the cannibals killed and ate them.Deodato's masterwork is a cheapjack con job which in the hands of a talented director could have been disturbing.

First is a musk rat, which is stabbed in the neck repeatedly with a knife. Then you see them drag a sea turtle up on shore and decapitate it. Not only do they cut off the head but the first whack doesn't kill it and you get to see its feet kicking in fury as it's head hangs halfway off. Next is a monkey who's face is cut off with a machete. Then you have a piglet which is tied up, kicked around, shot (but not killed yet) and left twitching on the ground. There's plenty of realistic looking gore in this movie done on people with use of special effects yet the animals do not get this luxury and are just slaughtered for a shock effect. It eventually gets to the point that every time you see an animal, you find yourself saying ""are they seriously going to kill a -insert animal name here- now?""For those saying ""animals are killed all the time, you eat hamburgers"" yeah, animals are killed for food, purpose, these animals were killed for reaction. Not a single animal in this movie was killed for food.Oh and to those calling it a masterpiece, really? This is the most boring piece of garbage I've ever seen.

456,LookAtTheBlood,What an awful ending to such a promising film,4,28 April 2005,"Well...I have to say, the ending ruined the entire feel of the film for me.Yes I was shocked when the animals were killed...but I was actually more relieved that it wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. Anyone who has seen slaughter house footage knows that it is MUCH worse than anything in this film...although I in no way am justifying the sick and sadistic murder of these animals. I'm also relieved that the footage showed the film crew actually eating the animals (well, only muskrat, turtle, and monkey) so at least they didn't go to waste (spider, snake, and pig did though).I watch horror films to watch SPECIAl EFFECTS...CH is a cheap cop out that uses real animal SNUFF instead of SE...so there's no CRAFT to it...just sadistic measures because make-up is too lazy to create effective SE. I enjoyed the FAKE HUMAN GORE (See FAKE, note CRAFT and SPECIAL EFFECTS) at the beginning of the film and felt I was watching something special, that I could look beyond the animal snuff and watch something entertaining. NOPE! Ruggerro really makes us hate the crew through very effective measures, they kill without remorse and sacrifice even their own crew for the shoot. However, when the time comes for them to get their...WTF!!!! First off, Jack is too far away for us to really see anything worthwhile...we get guts flying in the air and a quick penis shot...lame. He should have been more in pain, we should have seen his penis SLOWLY cut off and him SLOWLY gutted, it seemed as if he were dead already, what's the point? Then Fay get's hers, well, we see her get raped enough (very fake looking, the natives are humping ALONGSIDE her, obviously getting nowhere near penetration) and when she gets bludgeoned, camera shakes from afar, no deep cuts, and then they hold up a very fake looking head. The head looked so fake that a tree was obviously used to cover the flakiness of the shot. I did not watch any of the scenes FRAME BY FRAME either...I WATCHED IT IN ONE SITTING AND let IT PLAY THROUGH AS IT WAS Meant TO BE SEEN....VERY FAKE!! Ater this, the two remaining crew members are taken care of by having the natives rush the camera, the camera spins around, and a head covered in Caro syrup lays before the fallen camera while the natives do a little dance behind him.PUH-lease! The gore at the begging was so effective when the cannibals were eating that arm and then when the Dr. had to feast with the cannibals and also the remains of the crew (or any remains for that matter) looked so great that I was really excited for the rest of the film, looking forward to the climax.Nope...there is no justice to be had and we don't get the pleasure of seeing these bastards torn limb from limb as the film promises. The whole film was a giant tease, paying off in the beginning and promising more that would never come.Instead, we're treated to snuff crap and a cop out ending and some of the dumbest revelations ever (we are savages in our own right, NAW! YOU THINK!? Yeah, ""civilized"" wars are so much better than ""uncivilized"" wars - sarcasm if you can't tell) Still...it was a nice attempt, although when the executives become disgusted with the footage and the one of the phone says he wants it all burnt it feels like the cheesy ""moral learned by all"" ending.The crew had done immoral things for their past documentaries (Last Road to Hell ( which was real footage - yup they killed that little kid and now you know what it looks like to see a child die, aren't you a better person?) was supposedly set up by the crew as well, the woman states that Allen ""payed the soldiers to do a bit of acting"" and Allen says while burning the villagers alive ""Yeah, a set up like in (forgot name of place, but referred to Last Road to Hell, I'm not gonna look it up or watch the movie again)"")in the past and...what? Is this suppose to be the last straw? Bullcrap! So it's OK for them to pay soldiers to kill people but NOT OK for them to kill people themselves? Yeah right. If the execs supposedly ate up Last Road they would LOVE Green Hell and edit it to their liking and release it. Anything for a crowd pleaser, that's how media really are in many instances.Thus the film really started out with something special, but then gave us a really stupid resolve. We don't witness the punishment of the true bad guys and the point of it all is thrown out the window. Supposedly this is a commentary on how media is obsessed with violence and suddenly violence disturbs the execs to the point of destroying what they were seeking.Not the smart movie it promised to be...just a dumb exploitation film...and not even a good one at that. Watch the first third and the mondo scenes if you MUST, but if you're the kind of person to seek this film out then you have seen worse...trust me.",Cannibal Holocaust

The things that stand out most are for sure the special effects and plot, but mostly the morality of the tale in whole. At first it seems like your average tale of woe as you wait for the build up and once it gets going you find yourself relating to the film crew as normal folk seeking answers to the primitive unknown. You feel sorrow for there plight once Professor Harold Monroe (Robert Kerman) finds they've been dismembered and possibly eaten.

460,texas12,it's a movie,10,30 December 2004,"Sickening yes- repulsive no. For if you are repulsed by the portrayals on the screen , you are rejecting your own inner demons and the very nature of humans. That's what Ruggero is aiming for. To make us all talk about what is sickening and horrible, and to think about it. Of course, he seeks to profit from it as well. People and animals die. It is the way of the world. There is no glorification of the issue of death, merely a representation of it. If you watch the movie and comment on it, you are as culpable as the next person for furthering its allure. Positive or negative feelings aside, anyone who decided to watch it, CHOSE to. That's a life lesson. Choices. We can choose to suppress our primordial urges or fess up to them. We also choose what to watch and what to believe. You can hide from reality, but you can't avoid it. That doesn't mean we have to accept ""barbaric"" behavior. I think this movie just keeps us all a little honest. It's no more pathetic or gratuitous than most other ""horror"" movies. The message or representation it gives is what is really biting. More so than what you get with cheesy high end Hollywood productions with special effects galore and such. Bravo to the director for his vision . Sickening it is, but so is society to a great degree.

The screenplay is very simple, the performance are bad (too bad), an the appearance of Salvo Basile (one of the most horrible actors on movie and TV history) makes this film very unreal. If you can to avoid this movie do it, if you want to torture you (if you are masochist for example), or if you enjoy the free blood and the simple, unreal and stereotyper point of view of the director about the American natives who lives in the Amazonas, watch it, I only say to you: beware this is one of the most coarse and rough film ever made, but if you have a fascination for this kind of movies, i only can say: watch it and good look.

Having handed over my £19.99 to the store I took the DVD home and sat down to watch again a film classic. Well what can I say. I do not know who edited it but they cared little about keeping the original element in the film. The quality of my copy was not that good, quite a lot of background noise. It almost seemed that the DVD was made from a video copy. The original, although violent had a style about it but this version, because of the editing, seems to have lost most of the 'shock' factor which was what made this film. I was so disappointed that I rang the store and returned the DVD the next day. Sorry Holocaust fans. I would really think twice before handing over the money for such a decimated version.

463,WannabeSmartass,The worst movie I've ever paid real money for.,3,2 April 2005,"I first heard of this film on a message board where it was described as too brutal for anyone ""normal"" to watch. This, and numerous other sources accolading its grisliness, got me interested and I decided to take this test of character and see what category I fell into. I don't consider myself a person who's easy to make squeal, but if the action gets spooky enough, I can be seen peeking at it amidst my fingers. That said, I really looked forward to seeing this.When I finally got through watching the 86-minute version after just gawking at the DVD-case for a few days, building up the expectations, I have to say that I was utterly disappointed. I wanted to be shocked out of my worn out socks, but this just didn't happen. It completely failed to live up to its controversial hype. It didn't even come across as a horror movie, but as a half-assed sociological statement made into a too long film.The much ballyhooed gore did nothing for me. People got ritualistically raped, bludgeoned to death, staked, eaten and whatnot, but I just noticed myself thinking that all of it was just part to that primitive society; those were customs of that people, as gruesome and cruel the acts might seem. It was like in nature documentaries where you see lions rip a zebra's guts out. I don't lose my stomach in the sight of nature running its course, nor did I do so while watching this film. The scenes that I'd heard to be the most horrifying, like the slaughtering of the pig and the turtle, were cut out from my version, but I don't think those would have made much of a difference in this respect. Though, I do think it was absolutely unnecessary and sensationalist to kill live animals. This was probably the most daunting aspect of the movie, a questionable merit to say the least. Excluding these, the most disturbing parts were the atrocities conducted by the portrayed film crew itself, as these people had no real motive behind their actions, besides making money and becoming famous. Unfortunately, these scenes were taken too much over the top to be credible and, thus, effective.There is a message in this film. It is not gore just for the sake of it, I kind of wish it were, but it's not. The message isn't really concealed in any way, but repeated very explicitly several times during the the film so that even the most dense viewers get the picture. It's basically criticism towards the way anthropologists and documentary filmmakers manipulate their study subjects to make them behave in a certain way. This is demonstrated, for example, by having the film crew, consisting of four (4) young people, round up an entire cannibal tribe into a shack and setting it on fire in order to stage some war footage. Unbelievable? Believe it. Such overstating just took the edge off for me, although I was quite pleased to see all four of them getting torn to pieces in the end because of it. A more subtle and discrete approach would probably have worked better. The other major theme  using the term major loosely here  is the question of who the savages really are: the all-exploiting urbanites or the people living in trees in the jungles? The contrast between these two worlds is brought forth by showing footage of the jungle and camera pans of skyscrapers subsequently, with eerie music playing in the background. This is done several times, inefficiently. The movie goes for these issues in a very simplistic and monotonous way, which gets very tiring.This thematic straightforwardness combined with non-existent acting and somehow sub-par voice overs leaves very little to be enjoyed. Also, the fact that this trash is considered horror is deceiving at best. Real horror doesn't come from blood and guts alone (even if you add some eerie samples to the mix), Mr. Ruggero Deodato should have known that. This piece of trash is best described as mondo. Three stars just for the cut off penis at the end  that made me chuckle.",Cannibal Holocaust

It's exploitative trash, plain and simple.The copious amounts of animal torture serve no practical purpose, and exist only to garner a measure of controversy to help titillate the film's jaded audience. To argue that this type of cruelty is no different from that meted out ( no pun intended ) in the butchery trade is risible, as this sort of snuff is done exclusively for the ""entertainment"" of the viewer and offers no redemption for the act of killing other than to satiate the blood-lust of your average voyeur.Leaving the animal torture aside, what actually exists in the ""body"" of this film to justify such overblown praise? The acting is abysmal, the soundtrack is monotonous, the story line is sophomoric and the dialogue is laughable.

Last week when i saw the movie i was not able to sleep all night.

For most of the time during the film i really thought that the footage shown in the film was real.The rape scenes in the movie are also disturbing. Also the punishment to the adultery is also very gruesome and gore.

466,davidatkins,"In parts a fun film, but it can't escape its own hypocrisy.",6,28 February 2010,"I really loved aspects of Cannibal Holocaust. It was far gorier and shocking then any of other of the so called 'video nasties' i've watched so far, and it was put together with aplomb. Although this wasn't the first film to use fake documentary footage, it's incredibly realistic and undoubtedly bought the technique to a mainstream audience influencing, if not directly, The Last Broadcast, The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield. Much like The Blair Witch Project, it was deliberately implied during promotion of the film that the four documentary filmmakers were not actors and that the recovered footage shown in the film was real. Unlike The Blair Witch Project, this claim is slightly preposterous as half of the film is shot in a traditional cinematic way.The gore in Cannibal Holocaust is at times incessant, but still manages to maintain its realism and shock factor. One infamous scene shows a woman impaled on a tall wooden stake, the spike protruding through her mouth. The effect was so realistic the filmmakers had to explain how it was achieved in court to avoid a murder charge. The marketing trick of blurring the line between fantasy and reality obviously worked on the Italian authorities.Cannibal Holocaust is a damning criticism of the media's tendency to focus on horrific images when covering war and violent conflict. At the time various news agencies had been accused of faking such images to improve ratings. More broadly, the film questions who is more uncivilised, the cannibals with their unusual and primal rituals, or the civilised filmmakers who exploit them for ratings and cheap shocks?Although often lacking in subtlety, Cannibal Holocaust's script makes its point well, especially during the last half of the movie when the viewer is shown the recovered reels of films. These scenes are narrated by the disapproving Professor, ensuring that even a ten year old can understand the underlying point of the film. The documentary makers not only exploit the tribes by filming their day to day rituals in a lurid manner, but they also interfere, terrorise, murder and rape the tribe's people to elicit responses for them to film. When the documentary makers discover the woman impaled on a spike the cameraman has to tell one of the men on film to stop smiling; he can't help showing his glee at finding something so horrific to capture on celluloid.The original cut of the film lingers on a depressing amount of animal cruelty, presumably because it's a cheap way to make the viewer question what is real and what is fake. After all, these crazy uncivilised tribes will cut anything up for some wacky ritual or a quick bite, the film's just showing what happens in the real world, right?And this alludes to my problem with Cannibal Holocaust. How can one point the finger at media for exploitation when the filmmakers themselves think it's acceptable to film an extended sequence of giant turtle being caught, decapitated and gutted, just for a cheap thrill? How can they justify cutting a live monkeys face off (twice, to get all the shots required) in the name of art or to make a political point? The filmmakers are either completely naive or, worse, making a film they know is exploitative and immoral, using the political message as a get-out clause, something to excuse the barbaric and stupid, stupid, stupid animal cruelty. It's heartening to read interviews with the directors and actors expressing remorse for using animal cruelty, but this doesn't excuse it.Cannibal Holocaust is in parts a fun film, but it can't escape its own hypocrisy. It's a shame that the animal cruelty happened, because without it the film would be a sure fire classic.",Cannibal Holocaust
467,scott_jacobs,Uncomfortable and disturbing.,8,21 December 2020,"I first watched this on Google video when I was in my teens with a friend, expecting to sit there and mock the film for entertainment. Yet, in ended up being a film watched in silence and horror at the scenes I had just seen. It wasn't the usual fun I have with a film, and definitely wasn't like anything I'd seen before. The gore and the violence is extreme and horrific, and the soundtrack to this day haunts me. I can not hear the main theme without being taken aback.Despite this, being from an age of the Internet and hearing about nasty urban legends of horrible videos, the film has a strong moral point, which I guess can be said in reference to media coverage on acts and these urban legend videos. The tension and violence builds to an explosive finale that, despite wanting to turn away, your eyes are transfixed.It's not a film I have seen often, yet I respect its raw and controversial part in horror history. You can't ignore its impact, and if you wish to look beyond the content, it's one of the most original and fantastic bit of filmmaking. The SFX are incredible, and anyone interested in SFX I would highly say to look at a certain scene on a pole. I've only watched a few cannibal films, and they have all be somewhat campy and just shock value, but Cannibal Holocaust, though is offensive, has shock value, isn't campy and stands to be a social commentary on western culture and their views on what is deemed different to their society, and who is the real villain. (I might not have explained that last part particularly well, so please forgive me if it doesn't make sense)I don't hound or shame anyone for not choosing to watch this, I do not recommend this to anyone, and would just recommend reading about it if you are unsure about viewing it. For someone who has a strong stomach, this for me, sits right on the edge of the line. Also, there is some very unkind and horrible animal cruelty in this film which brings this film down.

The purpose of this film is to teach a lesson. The average city man is not as civilized as he thinks he is. Even compared to a tribe of ruthless cannibals, we still reign the most ignorant and careless. Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust shows real animal killings, to show that we just don't give a care about who or what dies. We destroy the rain forest, we deplete the ozone, and we cause global warming.

There is no subtlety, a factor that takes away from an otherwise high-quality film.Besides that, the actual message is taught by the director creating unlikely characters. He's wanting to teach us that we are as barbaric as those ""savages"" we deride, yet does so by creating far-fetched scenarios.

It's a beautifully done film, with a capturing storyline, vivid characters, beautiful landscape, and above all a divine soundtrack, that if you hear without seeing the film you could never believe that its tied to such a morbid expression of art.

I did watch this movie for gore and guts, but in the end I came to realize that its not the violence that makes it special, but the beauty that shines through from behind the carnage.... as for those who say its a cheep flick... well they either have a too sensitive stomach or a feeble heart or, maybe, a too stubborn head, an excess of violence is not necessarily a flaw, it can also be, like everything else in the world an expression of art.",Cannibal Holocaust

488,matthewfinlay-43878,The Last Road To Hell,7,27 January 2019,"It's tough to really talk about Cannibal Holocaust. Not because it's a high art cinema masterpiece, more because it's a gut wrenching crawl through the pits of depravity. Even today, 30 years after its release, it's still a film that brings out intense disgust and revolt. A film so controversial, it still remains banned and heavily censored In numerous countries. A film so gruesomely realistic, the director was charged with obscenity and was accused of making a snuff film. Yet without Cannibal Holocaust, the world wouldn't have found footage movies, a low budget genre of horror which presents itself as a real event, captured through a home camera which was popularised by films like The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity. This film birthed a genre, and for that its cemented itself into film history.Cannibal Holocaust is ripe with numerous cliches for the genre. The typical, group of film makers go missing and their footage is discovered later. Interestingly the film itself spends a large amount of time focusing on the discovery of the footage. Professor Harold Monroe (portrayed by famous porn star Robert Kerman) ventures into the depths of the amazon in search of a missing documentary team (consisting of Alan, the director (Gabriel Yates), his girlfriend Faye (Francesca Ciardi), and their two cameramen Mark (Luca Barbareschi) and Jack (Perry Pirkanen)) who were shooting a film on the Yanomamö and Shamatari tribes. Upon discovering their footage, he takes it back to New York and clashes with TV executives who desire to use the footage in a guaranteed ratings success documentary. Upon viewing the footage, the true nature of the crew shows itself in one of most testing, stomaching churning films ever made.Cannibal Holocaust mainly consists of two things. One: incredibly realistic and graphic violence and Two: surprisingly effective commentary on journalism ethics and western modernisation. Don't get me wrong, Cannibal Holocaust is muddled in its message. In its attempts to portray the ill effects of sensationalism, the film itself devolves into it. Beneath the commentary on journalistic ethics and treatment of indigenous peoples, is a horror film and a brutally violent one at that. Yet surprisingly, it manages to get its warped message across beneath the buckets of gore and horror. The crew making the documentary are cons, staging murders and causing terror in the search for the perfect shot. In a notable scene, the group stumbles into a Yacumo village where they hoard the villages up in a hut and set it a light, filming the resulting panic and chaos. Another notorious scene involves the male members of the crew violently rape a native girl, knowing full well she will be executed by the tribe. They discover her impaled corpse on the shore later and gleefully film the sight. The executives are aware of Alan's habit of committing murder with his crew yet they turn aw blind eye, because as one of the executives puts it ""Today people want sensationalism. The more you rape there senses the happier they are"". In a way she's right. Cannibal Holocaust paints a horrific picture that isn't afraid to use some of the darkest stuff ever set to tape to get its message across. Yet, there are times where it gets a bit out of hand.There's another thing about Cannibal Holocaust that tends to get people upset. The animal violence. Cannibal Holocaust uses genuine animal gore. Why it does this I have no idea but the nearly 5 minute scene of a turtle being bisected and disembowelled is where I started to get angry. Indeed, six animals are slaughtered on camera, the last five in a space of 30 minutes. Snakes and spiders are sliced in half, a pig is beaten and shot and in probably the worst scene of the film, a coatimundi is stabbed through the neck and dies a slow, painful death while screeching in agony. It's rancid, exploitive and most importantly: Cruel. Yet if you can look past such a thing, the actual meat and bones (pardon the pun) of Cannibal Holocaust is surprisingly effective. Yes it's overly gruesome, yes it's hypocritical, but I'll be damned if it didn't make me think. The film's harrowing conclusion is where things really descend into hell, as the crew are all violently massacred and eaten by the tribe. Yet still, even while their crew mate is gang raped and beheaded, the remaining crew insist on filming, even until they're torn to shreds. The footage stops and Monroe ponders to himself ""I wonder who the real cannibals are"". Cannibal Holocaust is disgusting. It's a vile, wretched piece of cinema that never ceases in offending and revelling in its own degeneracy. But still, it's a surprisingly effective and well thought out critique. On the western world, seeking to reach out its grasp into what remains of ancient tribes and to crush them. On the corrupted journalism scene, which warps the truth and commits heinous acts to get the perfect story. On the dangers of not respecting cultures alien to us. It's a long road to hell. And Cannibal Holocaust paints it perfectly, dripping with blood, realism and most of all truth.7/10",Cannibal Holocaust
