0,bkoganbing,"""You've Got Skills""",6,14 January 2011,"Into the life of Cameron Diaz who hails from Wichita, Kansas and is trying to get to her sister's wedding in Boston and who is the sexiest auto mechanic you'll ever see comes secret agent Tom Cruise. He's got himself an all purpose battery developed by Paul Dano that he's on the run with. Pulling the old Murphy shuffle in the Wichita Airport he puts it in Diaz's luggage. After that her life is in his hands.I have to say that Diaz for someone who has no training does take to the life of a secret agent on the run quite naturally with Cruise. Of course he's innocent, he stole the battery which will have perpetual energy to keep it from another agent, Peter Sarsgaard, from turning it over to an international arms dealer played by Jordi Molla. In the space of a few days Diaz and Cruise are all over the globe, Wichita, Boston, Salzberg, Spain, and even a nice tropical island for a brief respite which is rudely interrupted. The plot is reminiscent of the Cary Grant/Audrey Hepburn classic Charade which is not quite as action packed, but has the same premise of Hepburn never quite sure if she can trust the charming Grant.No one will ever list this as one of Tom Cruise's best films, but his international star brigade will be pleased.",Knight and Day
1,Leofwine_draca,Dreadful spoof of the spy genre,3,26 June 2017,"I found KNIGHT AND DAY to be a slick and soulless slice of screen entertainment, bloated by a budget stretching in to the hundreds of millions and lacking any kind of style, wit, or originality of its own. It comes across as a comic spoof of the BOURNE franchise, loaded down with random action sequences which come thick and fast but do nothing to further the plot, and overly reliant on CGI and super-fast editing to make it all a mindless jumble. Tom Cruise's arrogant super-agent is one of those characters who can take down dozens of villains without breaking a sweat and there's something inherently creepy about him here. As for Cameron Diaz, slipping into her familiar 'bumbling dolt' routine, she's dreadful, and I'm afraid that's my approximation of the film as a whole.",Knight and Day
2,SnoopyStyle,Stupid Fun,5,6 October 2013,"Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) is a mysterious secret agent. June Havens (Cameron Diaz) is an everywoman who's trying to get to her sister April (Maggie Grace)'s wedding. Then the two characters get tangled up in a flight.Almost none of it made sense. The more you think about it, the less reasonable it is. Why would they let her on the plane? Why would he keep trying to involve himself with her? Don't think about any of it or you'll get a headache.It's best to turn your brain off. Once you do that, this is a watchable action farce. The chemistry between Cruise and Diaz is artificial, but they're good enough actors to play. And sure they're playing here. It's playing fun and games. Nothing serious. I won't recommend it, but it's not the worse thing in the world.",Knight and Day
3,claudio_carvalho,Brainless and Forgettable Adventure,6,28 December 2010,"While waiting for her flight to Boston at the Wichita Airport, June Havens (Cameron Diaz) is bumped by a stranger twice. Then she has trouble to embark in the aircraft but she finally gets a seat in the plane. During the flight, she learns that the stranger is the former agent Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) that is under FBI surveillance and has just killed everybody on board including the two pilots, who were agents trying to arrest him. Roy lands the plane in a cornfield and tells June that she is in danger; then she faints under the influence of the drug Roy secretly gave to her. On the next morning, June awakes at home and sooner she is abducted by FBI agents. But Roy rescues her and tells that he is protecting a powerful source of energy and its inventor Simon Feck (Paul Dano) from the rogue agent Fitzgerald (Peter Sarsgaard) that has framed him and from a powerful drug dealer and they want the invent to sell it. But when June overhears a conversation of Roy with a woman, she questions whether he is telling the truth or not. ""Knight and Day"" is a brainless and forgettable adventure that uses all possible clichés to entertain despite the countless flaws in the story. The 1.75 m height Cameron Diaz is a good comedian and ""steals"" the film. The 1.70 m height Tom Cruise insists in performing this type of character but could be a reasonable action hero if he were 20 cm taller. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Encontro Explosivo"" (""Explosive Encounter"")",Knight and Day
4,nogodnomasters,GOOD ACTION-COMEDY ROMANCE,10,7 May 2018,"MINOR PLOT SPOILERSThe name Knight comes from the real name of Tom Cruise aka Rob Miller aka Matthew Knight. Plus he uses a toy knight to conceal an experimental battery that can power a whole city. I am sure there may be some other knight symbols, such as knight in shining armor etc., but the movie isn't designed to be that deep. Cruise bumps into Diaz (June) in an airport as they get on the same flight. After some innocent flirting Diaz goes into the airplane restroom and does some primping, trying to figure out how to hook up with Rob Miller (Cruise). While Diaz is looking in the mirror checking out her T&A, Cruise is being attacked by everyone on the plane. Diaz comes out, has a drink with Cruise who explains that the pilots are dead.Later in the movie Diaz attempts to have a serious conversation with her former bf. As she explains about the airplane, he ignores her and tries to talk about ""the relationship."" The movie is filled with these numerous turn arounds, most of which come near the end. One chase scene reminded us of that ""Mission Impossible"" criticized impossible train explosion scene, as Cruise jumps to the wind shield of an automobile which Diaz is driving. Crusie jumps around building tops like The Phantom and at one point Diaz models a red bikini for us. Eventually Diaz gets into the whole spy thing and decides to take matters in her own hands. The movie is fun and clever. The action has impossible chase scenes, but what action movie doesn't. It would make a great date movie.Occasional dropping of the F-bomb",Knight and Day
5,kosmasp,Vacation time,7,21 October 2010,"I had seen an interview with Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise, while they were shooting this movie. And one thing became apparent (which also is very much apparent in the movie): They had lots of fun doing the movie. And while it does have quite a few flaws (story/continuity-wise and so forth), you could just sit back and relax a movie, that just wants to entertain.Not all jokes work (for me), especially a pay off, at the end of the movie, delivered by Camerons, just feels too forced, but all in all, this was entertaining enough. Just try not to think too much about it and let this warm-up for M:I 4 (at least for Tom Cruise) do the job for you. Yes you can and some probably will hate it (and it's completely understandable), but I let my doubts (even after watching it) aside and gave it 7 instead of 6 out of 10 ...",Knight and Day
6,jboothmillard,Knight and Day,5,21 August 2010,"I saw the trailer and thought it looked cool and funny, and then the two stars appeared on Top Gear, I was definitely going to check it out, from director James Mangold (Girl, Interrupted; Walk the Line). Basically car mechanic June Havens (Cameron Diaz) is carrying old car parts for her father, and heading for her sister's wedding, accidentally bumps into charming and handsome Roy Miller (Tom Cruise). After bumping into each other again they find out they are on the same flight and have a flirty conversation, and after returning from the plane bathroom she finds out what he really is. Roy is a rogue FBI agent who unclear intentions, and June caught right in the middle of the chaos, she has no idea who to trust, Roy or the FBI, and only that both sides are looking for an energy source known as the Zephyr. Through the course of coming into contact with each other again, Roy and June travel all over the world to Massachusetts, California, Austria, Jamaican Islands, Illinois and Spain among others. Roy has the Zephyr and is counting on June to help protect it, and he also has the inventor Simon Feck (Paul Dano), the bad guys want either of these things to succeed. Eventually, Roy comes to the conclusion that his old partner in the FBI, Fitzgerald (Jarhead's Peter Sarsgaard), is setting him up and planning to sell the Zephyr to the terrorists, but don't worry, the world and the June are saved in the end. Also starring Taken's Maggie Grace as April Havens, Marc Blucas as Rodney and Doubt's Viola Davis as Director George. Cruise and Diaz make a good double act, and there are just about enough explosive action, chase and guns blazing sequences, the North by Northwest style story could have been worked on, but overall, not too bad. Cameron Diaz was number 65, and Tom Cruise number 32 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Diaz was number 26, and Cruise number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and Cruise was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Worth watching!",Knight and Day
7,Tweekums,Mission Ridiculous!,7,9 January 2012,"The review I'd heard suggested that this wasn't a particularly good film but when I saw in on the bargain shelf I thought I'd give it a go; after all both Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz have been reliable in previous films I've watched. I didn't have to watch for long before realising I made the right choice. Diaz plays June Havens a mechanic who literally bumps into secret agent Roy Miller, played by Cruise, as they are about to board a plane. She is initially told it is full but later is told there is a space; strangely the plane is almost empty. While she is in the lavatory freshening up the other people on the plane make their move against Miller; he quickly dispatches them all and is forced to land the plane in a field this is just the beginning of the action. June wakes up at home but is soon taken into custody by people claiming to be federal agents; she is soon rescued by Miller but still doesn't know if he is the good guy, a bad guy or dangerously paranoid and delusional. The later finds herself in a variety of locations including an island in the Azores, in Austria and in Spain as Miller tries to find Simon Feck; the inventor of the 'Zephyr' a battery which can apparently power a small city, never runs out and is no bigger than a regular torch battery A variety of people also want to get to Feck or to Miller who has pocketed the only working version of the battery.The action was all fairly exciting and included gunfights, explosions, car chases, fights on a train and even a scene where the protagonists ride a motorcycle while being chased by bad guys through streets full of rampaging bulls! Some of the action included CGI but that was fairly well executed and where the stunts were real they looked good. While it isn't full of one-liners or slapstick it made me laugh out loud far more than I expected. Cruise and Diaz were good in their roles they work really well together. I had expected Cruise to be the main character but in reality it is Diaz; the story is seen from her point of view and we don't see all that much that she doesn't see this does of course mean we don't see how the pair escape from an apparently impossible situation after he drugs her or otherwise renders her unconscious something he does on a regular basis! While this is no 'Citizen Kane' it was a lot of fun; I'd certainly recommend picking it up if you see it on the bargain shelf or watching it on television.",Knight and Day
8,paul_haakonsen,Action-packed comedy with a punch!,8,30 October 2010,"I was sort of influenced by the somewhat bad reviews I had read about this movie, but decided to watch it anyway, because both Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz usually make good movies. So I sat down and watched it, and I am glad that I did.There is action all throughout the movie, from the beginning till the very end, and it is the sort of action that is in your face and keeps your adrenalin pumping without being too much over the edge. And the action scenes were well choreographed and worked well.Also, the comedy in the movie was well used at the right times, adding a lot of flavor to the movie. This aspect gave the movie so much charm and it worked wonderfully. Both Cruise and Diaz were good with these comedy twists.The story is pretty straight forward and easy to follow, leaving some up for you to guess and speculate about, and that was good.As for the cast, well as always, Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz put on magnificent work. I personally think that this is actually one of Tom Cruise's best movies. But of course, we all have our own preferences. The supporting cast also did well.My friend said that this movie seemed like an imitation of the ""Mission Impossible"" movies, but I think it is in a whole other league. This one is an action-comedy while the others are pure action.This movie is good for an evenings entertainment with lots of action and laughs. And the chemistry between Cruise and Diaz makes it worth it just for that alone. If you haven't seen this movie already, get to it!",Knight and Day
9,Quinoa1984,"a fantastic hook, and some charming moments, but it fizzles out and doesn't recover",6,17 July 2010,"Knight and Day has, what we might call in Screen writing 101, a 'hook', more than that it's a terrific hook when used with the right star (Tom Cruise) and a possibly good leading lady (Cameron Diaz). A woman is about to get on the plane and bumps into a man near the entrance at the airport. He tries to warn her, perhaps too subtly, not to get on the plane. But she does, they have a long deep talk, find a connection, looks like a romantic thing will happen... and then he shoots everyone on the plane, including the pilots, as they're all out to kill him. Luckily, he can land the plane (mostly safely), and as it turns out he's really a secret agent. More to the point, a rogue secret agent who has a MacGuffin device that other people, nefarious characters, want in their possession, and this baffled, sometimes hysterical woman, has to go along for the ride.It is a fine hook, delivered with some verve and humor by way of James Mangold's direction and a smart script that, at least at first, gives a lot for Cruise to chew on. We haven't seen Cruise have this much fun in a role in a while (Les Grossman notwithstanding), and here and there (like the ""You, without me, you with me.. YOU without me, you with me"" moment made me think of ""Help ME, help YOU"" bit from Jerry Maguire), and Diaz brings her charms and little moments of believability to the party as well. But it's around the forty minute mark or so, around the time we know what this 'thing' is that can power up an entire city (again, MacGuffin, if a little more hi-tech than usual), and when it kicks into a generic action movie plot, that it starts to go downhill.It's not an immediate descent. We still have some moments of star-power quality, like when Cruise's character Roy Miller drugs June (yet again, rolls eyes), and takes her to his hidden island out in the middle of nowhere. This is a very cool little scene, even when it might get spoiled by June taking a phone call that reveals their position to the nefarious characters. But generic-itis, a mode that happens when the story decides to kick into a kind of auto-pilot, takes over. I could tell beat for beat everything else that would happen; it also didn't help that a sub-plot of sorts involving Peter Sarsgaard seemed very reminiscent (if not just by coincidence the same) as a sub-plot involving a certain character in the recent A-Team movie. This is only a spoiler if you've seen the A-Team, but really, is it that not obvious?This could all be passable, and it sometimes is, if the acting quality remained the same throughout. But as the generic plot takes over, a lot of the charm and surprise from early on in the film drifts away as well, as June becomes a lot better equipped with her sort of borrowed spy- ability. It functions till the end as decent escapist fare, with a few neat sequences (a running-of-the-bulls scene intertwined with a motorcycle-car chase is fun). If only the certain awesome quality of the hook was maintained through the rest of the film, instead of the lesser qualities of the Screen writing 101 class didn't take over, and if only other supporting actors (i.e. Paul Dano) were used to fuller potential.",Knight and Day
10,tavm,"Knight and Day has good-looking leads in Cruise and Diaz, decent action, and nothing else",4,10 May 2011,"Watched this movie on Netflix with my mom. While Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz are both easy on the eyes and there's plenty of good action and some humorous visuals, this was a pretty confusing concoction from the start. I mean, the Diaz character is supposed to go to her sister's wedding and she doesn't worry too much of how much time has passed during most of the movie? And we don't really get why these two seem to eventually get along well at the end. Still, those chase scenes are pretty awesome so there's that to look forward to. And the movie has only about 90 or so minutes to fill. With all that said, the only thing I'll mention is that Knight and Day seems like decent time-waster if that's your thing.",Knight and Day
11,edwagreen,When Chivalry is Long Gone: Knight and Day *1/2,3,11 June 2011,"Very bad film with Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz teaming up in a picture that is ill-conceived. You know we're in for it when Diaz is refused to go on board a plane and suddenly she is allowed to and the plane is mostly empty.If only the ""k"" in the title had been dropped and we had the old Cole Porter biography instead. In the old days, Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn would have played these parts with a far superior script.As Roy Miller, Cruise is supposed to be a hero-like figure smitten with ""passenger"" Diaz, who becomes his partner in all this. Each time each wakes up to another day of adventure in another land entirely.Cruise is hiding the zephyr. What is this all about?",Knight and Day
12,michaelRokeefe,Always a bride's maid...but she meets her man.,7,15 January 2011,"James Mangold gets to direct two eye appealing actors, Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz, is this globe-trotting action flick. June Havens(Diaz), the beauty she is, is on her way to her sister's wedding when she literally bumps into a man who will change her life. June finds herself in the middle of fight between a rogue government agent, Roy Miller(Cruise), and the FBI. Being warned of future questioning, June is whisked off to safety as Roy stays on the move to exotic locations like France, Spain and Austria. Amongst all the confusion and automatic gunfire, June forges a bond with Roy. It's like he couldn't shake her off if he tried. Roy confides to her he is actually trying to protect a newly invented energy source that could be of enormous wealth to who ends up controlling it. But does this mean good guys are going bad? Cruise and Diaz appear to work extremely well together. I wouldn't mind seeing this pairing again. Especially Cameron walking away. I think this movie may be able to cause more interest in Cruise, who I think may have lost some of his luster. Along with the action and attractive settings there is a very good soundtrack featuring the likes of Hall & Oates, The Kingsmen, Scorpion, Christopher Cross and probably the best song of all featured during the closing credits...""Someday"" by The Black Eyed Peas. This exhilarating action-comedy also stars: Peter Sarsgaard, Viola Davis, Jordi Molla, Maggie Grace and Marc Blucas.",Knight and Day
13,sunwarrior13,A Fun Ride Provided By Cruise And Diaz,6,10 October 2011,"Knight and Day is a romantic action comedy film starring Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz.The film is directed by James Mangold.The plot follows the adventures of Roy Miller (Tom Cruise),a spy on the run, and June Havens (Cameron Diaz),a car restorer.He is seen watching Havens, and he bumps into her a couple of times as they go through security at Wichita Airport. While she is making her way back home to Boston from Kansas after picking up spare parts for her deceased father's car that she is restoring for her sister as a wedding gift. Even though she has a confirmed reservation for her flight, she is told at the gate that it is overbooked.The movie follows their adventures across the globe as both run from their perpetrators.The movie was pure fun and nothing more.It was a joy ride as we see a new roles for Cruise and Diaz in comedy.It is also worth mentioning that the chemistry between them seems lacking. I prefer them in together in Vanilla Sky and future drama films rather than this comedy. A 6/10 rating is decent for this film.",Knight and Day
14,Scarecrow-88,Knight and Day,7,10 June 2011,"To think, all of the action that takes place in the Summer blockbuster bait of ""Knight and Day"" is because of a special kind of battery. Cameron Diaz works her charm as an auto mechanic; her garage primarily focuses on restoring old classic cars. She meets Tom Cruise, special agent, at the airport, gets a ticket on board a flight containing an entire crew and passenger manifest consisting of shadowy assassins attempting to retrieve the battery—not to mention, eliminate Cruise who becomes ""solitary killing machine"" when Diaz hits the lady's room.The rest of the movie has poor Diaz mixed up in Cruise's global cat and mouse with the company he was once employed with, FBI or CIA, some sort of governmental entity which trains special agents and assigns them tasks and operations to perform.""Knight and Day"" is standard absurd escapist fare designed to cater to a crowd expecting thrills while munching on popcorn. Cruise's agent can accomplish stunning feats like multi-tasking when ""the enemy"" is after him, such as keeping his equilibrium in check despite having to shoot different weapons while on the top of cars as a number of people are firing machine guns in his direction. His motorcycle ride with Cameron as his passenger through the streets of a Spanish city during the ""running of the bulls"" and how Cruise constantly avoids certain death while people are chasing him is as preposterous and exciting as it gets. There are plenty of James Bond type heroics for Cruise here, but, to be honest, he's essentially sliding into the vacant chair Sly and Arnold filled during the 80s and 90s. The violence to those Cruise annihilates is shot in a manner befitting a larger viewing audience, no graphic bloodshed, despite the climbing body count and use of artillery. ""Knight and Day"" has the stunning locations typical of a globe-trotting action movie, such as a train in the Alps or the many places in Spain. Perhaps the biggest action sequence occurs in Boston, where Diaz' character lives.Sub-plots include Diaz preparing for her sister's nuptials and discovering Cruise's parents home (they believe he's dead), Paul Dano's misfit genius who invented the batter constantly in peril with Cruise his protector (although, Cruise treats him like a big brother), Peter Sarsgaard as the agent out to catch Cruise (he's actually the villain who wants the battery and framed Cruise as the ""rogue agent"" who betrayed his government), and Jordi Mollà as Antonio, also wanting the battery because of its value, using the many Spanish henchmen as his disposal in order to do so. Diaz finds herself knee-deep in espionage inadvertently, even one point having herself kidnapped by Antonio so that she can reunite with Cruise when they are separated. One funny scene has Diaz drugged by Antonio with a truth serum so that she can unveil the location of the battery, but all it does is cause her to ramble about everything except what he desires (it gets even funnier when Cruise storms Antonio's compound to rescue her and she admits they would probably have great sex!). ""Knight and Day"" has the usual mixture of romance, comedy, and ridiculous superhuman abilities of its hero (and heroine, since Diaz even performs some pretty impressive feats such as driving a car from the back seat while hunching over a dead driver while Cruise is dangling from different areas of the vehicle, not to mention, shooting a gun while sitting in Cruise's lap as he is driving the motorcycle through crowded streets and alleys with constant gunfire aimed right at them) we expect from a movie designed to target a large opening weekend during the summer. Sarsgaard, a fine actor, is really on auto-pilot here, not asked to do much except connive and plot his strategy for getting the battery. Cruise has several scenes (including the flight from Wichita and on board the train, where he must combat highly skilled assassins) where he must use Jason Bourne type martial arts skills.The use of a knock-out drug which subdues Diaz (and even Cruise at the end) so that Cruise can keep her from hysterics is an interesting device which shows a skewed perspective from the point-of-view of the one under its influence, how she can visualize (in a haze) certain moments awakening for brief intervals, before finally returning to a lucid state (it also allows the director to avoid showing how Cruise gets Diaz out of a seemingly impossible trap with a veritable army of Antonio's men in a warehouse and to an island ""off the grid"").",Knight and Day
15,Doylenf,A good roller-coaster ride of a thriller/comedy...the perfect summer blockbuster...,7,29 June 2010,"TOM CRUISE and CAMERON DIAZ seem to be having a wonderful ""crime"" in this amusing caper set up as an espionage thriller which succeeds in being a fun romantic action film with lots of over-the-top action sequences and some well delivered and breezy comic byplay.With some tantalizing scenic eye candy along the way (Spain, California, Jamaica, etc.), and some aggressive stunt work, the script unwinds at a brisk pace as soon as Cruise and Diaz lock eyes on each other and never lets up the pace. I'll omit details of the busy plot.PETER SARSGAARD has a rather colorless role as the villain of the piece but VIOLA DAVIS is quite effective as a principal player in the scheme of things.For light-hearted entertainment, this one should leave patrons satisfied, even if the ending is somewhat predictable. The fact that nothing else about the plot is cut and dry will keep fans awake for a good summer blockbuster.Cruise shows he still as the right stuff and Diaz is refreshing as the innocent victim who goes along for the ride.",Knight and Day
16,CinemaSerf,Routine vehicle for Cruise with Cameron Diaz this time...,6,14 October 2021,"Carneron Diaz (""June"") is heading to her sister's wedding in Boston. Before and again on her flight, she encounters the handsome (small) ""Roy"" (Tom Cruise) and very quickly her life is turned upside down as she finds herself - with him - being chased all over the place. Why? Well, that's because he has pinched the world's only prototype of a tiny battery that will never run out, and swapped it into her luggage to avoid detection. The FBI are soon hot on their trail, as is Peter Skarsgaard (""Fitzgerald"") determined to regain his prize that he has to deliver to ams dealer ""Antonio"" (Jordi Mollà). The plot is pretty thin and predictable, but the film doesn't hang about - there is plenty of action, shoot 'em ups, car chases, pyrotechnics and there is just a hint of on screen chemistry between the two as Diaz adapts quickly to her new, somewhat perilous lifestyle! Not great, this, and it maybe takes fifteen minutes too long to get going - but once underway it is repetitive, but never dull.",Knight and Day
17,dbborroughs,This didn't work for me,3,4 July 2010,"There is a point at which you have to throw caution to the wind and just go with a movie where it takes you, sometimes there is a movie that is so over the top that you have to just go with it where ever it takes you. Then there is another point where you have to throw your hands up and go as much fun as the film isn't paying me back for going with it blindly...Knight and Day is a nonsensical film about June who get mixed up with Roy a spy who drags her into an ever increasing series of huge action set pieces. Is romance far behind? The bits are very well done, but they are staged so knowingly that it kind of sucks the life out of it (one can be too knowing and too jokey). Worse the film constantly cheats to get you out of disaster and on to the next piece. I was admiring the technical virtuosity of the film but at the same time I never connected. (Worse Cameron Diaz is at best a non-actor with the result she never sells any of it.) Rereading this post I find it doesn't make a heck of a lot of sense but then again neither does this movie.Worth seeing for the great action, but wait for cable where the lack of a real plot won't be as painful.",Knight and Day
18,zardoz-13,Above-Average Rehash of a 1960's Euro Trash Spy Thriller,7,27 June 2010,"""Walk The Line"" director James Mangold and television scenarist Patrick O'Neill must have watched a bunch of European espionage thrillers from the 1960s before they made the new Tom Cruise & Cameron Diaz movie ""Knight and Day."" This predictable but entertaining international actioneer brings Cruise and Diaz together as two people on the lam from Federal agents and a trigger-happy Spanish arms dealer. The first time that Cruise and Diaz worked together, they made the murky ""Vanilla Sky"" (2001) with Kurt Russell. Indeed, ""Knight and Day"" qualifies as a big improvement over ""Vanilla Sky."" Furthermore, ""Knight and Day"" surpasses the similar themed ""Killers"" with Ashton Kutcher and Katherine Heigl. Nevertheless, this breathlessly paced, Alfred Hitchcock style, thriller lacks the flair of Cruise's ""Mission Impossible 2"" that Hong Kong action maestro John Woo turned into a slow-motion bullet ballet with our hero surviving some pretty incredible predicaments. ""Knight and Day"" boasts its share of hair-raising, cliff-hanger scenes. Most of them, however, have been performed before without blue screens and Mangold cannot substitute momentum for imagination. This is one of those improbable shoot'em up sagas where the virile hero is mighty handy with any fully automatic weapon in sight. He knows a thing or two about riding on the hood of a careening car while firing at multiple villains pursing him. In fact, some of the scenes here look as if they were lifted from ""Tomorrow Never Dies,"" ""Wanted,"" ""Moonraker,"" and ""Charade,"" not to mention all those Euro-thrillers. Audiences looking for something different may enjoy this above-average but contrived travelogue with fantastic photography and a credible cast.Tom Cruise plays Roy Miller. This Roy Miller has nothing in common with the Roy Miller that Matt Damon portrayed in the superior Iraq thriller ""Green Zone."" Cruise's Roy works for the CIA. He has stolen a small, D-sized battery that is ""the first perpetual energy source since the sun."" He explains to June (Cameron Diaz of ""The Box"") that the Zephyr ""isn't your average Duracell."" In fact, this is one battery that never has to be recharged. The darned thing runs forever. In the Hitchcock thrillers, the object that motivates the plot is referred to as a MacGuffin. Basically, a MacGuffin is something that the good guys and the bad guys are prepared to kill each other for to acquire. FBI agent Fitzgerald (Peter Sarsgaard of ""Orphan"") heads up the team of gun-toting agents nipping at Roy's heels. At the Wichita, Kansas, airport, Roy spots pretty June and slips the Zephyr into her luggage packed with spare car parts so that it will make it through airport security. Initially, when she tries to board the plane, the airline attendant informs June that she will have to take a later flight. Savvy Fitzgerald spotted the switch in the terminal and allows June to get a seat on the flight. Roy was hoping that this wouldn't happen. Naturally, June is surprised when she finds more than three-fourths of the seats aboard empty. Roy and she strike up a conversation. She reveals that she restores old cars. The jetliner hits turbulence and Roy catches her falling luggage before it smashes into her. All of this happens so quickly that June spills her drink into her lap. She heads off to the restroom to clean up. While she is in the restroom, she wonders about this mysterious guy. Meanwhile, Roy has his hands full with several tough customers who try to kill him, including the pilots. He dispatches them all as if he had been trained by James Bond and Jason Bourne. When June emerges from the toilet, everybody—including the pilots—lay dead, and Roy crash lands the jetliner in a cornfield in the middle of nowhere at night. Predictably, as they are trudging away from the crash, the fuselage bursts into flames and several terrific explosions ensue.Roy explains to June that some suspicious people are going to visit her. They are going to tell her a lot of bad things about him. For example, they are going to call him a rogue agent with little regard for life and no qualms about killing. They are also going to tell her that they are going to take her to a safe and secure place. Roy warns June not to climb into a vehicle with these liars. Moreover, whenever they mention the words 'safe' and 'secure' they are planning on killing her. Afterward, he knocks her out with a drugged drink so he can get her out of the line of fire. Keeping June out of the line of fire is somewhat more difficult than Roy envisaged. He has to abduct her at gun point in broad daylight from a Boston diner to clear her name. If she appears to be Roy's hostage, then the authorities—principally the CIA's director of counterespionage, Ms. George (Viola Davis of ""Law Abiding Citizen"")—won't think that she is a conspirator. Meanwhile, Spanish arms dealer Antonio Quintero (Jordi Mollà of ""The Alamo"") dispatches hordes of gunmen dressed like a SWAT team to descend on our heroes.Clocking in at 110 minutes, ""Knight and Day"" lunges from one outlandish predicament to another like a James Bond thriller. The audience will find itself in the same shoes that June—the ultimate innocent bystander without a clue—wears because both the good guys and the bad guys parcel out information a little bit at a time to make sure that it doesn't interfere with the slam-bang stunts, high speed car and motorcycle stunts, and the exploding vehicles that somersault through the air. Cruise musters his boyish charisma and Diaz flaunts her terrific body. They are both sympathetic characters and director James Mangold has the good sense to slap on layers of comedy to undercut some of the high body count shoot-outs. Nevertheless, ""Knight and Day"" seems too incoherent and second rate to top even Cruise's worst ""Mission Impossible"" thriller—""Mission Impossible 3""—and the surprises aren't very surprising in the long run.",Knight and Day
19,Boba_Fett1138,Entertaining enough to consider this a watchable movie.,6,9 July 2011,"Of course this is not a great movie but I don't mind this sort of movies being made. The sort of movies with a big budget and a star cast behind it, that are purely being made to entertain. For the studios it's a good and safe way to make some big cash and for its audience it can be often a pleasant viewing experience. A typical popcorn-flick.And yes, you can say a lot about this movie but it at least is an entertaining one to watch. Just sit back and enjoy. A perfect movie to kill some time with when you don't want to watch anything too heavy.But by saying all this I'm not claiming that this is a great movie. On the contrary really. It's flawed in more than a couple of ways and most notably with its story. The movie is such nonsense and the story is highly unlikely and too often just doesn't make any sense. It just isn't the most clever spy-comedy around and it even gets quite tiresome after a while. It's definitely a movie that feels longer than it truly is and it could and also probably should all had ended way sooner. So no, I won't watch this movie any time soon again but still I don't regret ever watching it.It really is its high budget and star power behind it that makes this movie such a watchable one. Its high budget provides the movie with plenty of big action moments. The one more realistic and better looking than the other. But the movie gets still mostly driven by its actors. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz play the lead roles in this movie and you just can't really go wrong with those two. I have always liked Tom Cruise, especially in action movies. He can be a true action star, that on top of things also can really act, unlike most other action stars. And even though he's close to being 50, he still has the right looks for the part and can still play it convincingly. Watching him in this movie, you would never guess how old he truly was at the time. Same can be said for Cameron Diaz, who is also still great looking for her age and actually only seems to get prettier. I never cared much about Cameron Diaz' looks back in the days when she was the new hot star in Hollywood, around the time she did ""The Mask"" and ""There's Something About Mary"" but suddenly I'm now way more able to appreciate her looks and I'm even start to like her better as an actress as well.It's still kind of odd as to why all these big names, both in front and behind the camera, decided to sign on to this movie. I guess that things looked great and promising on paper, while the execution of it was a bit lacking and also sort of a disappointment. And I can really see this movie working out as a way better- and also more fun one, instead of the movie that it's now but at least it also isn't the horrible movie lots of other people are claiming it to be.A good movie to kill some time with.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Knight and Day
20,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,It's the little things,7,22 July 2010,"Yep, it really is. That's exactly where this works and stands out from its kind. Maybe I should start by saying that this is a fine enough piece of mindless popcorn entertainment, and if that's what you want, if you go in expecting just that, you are likely to not be disappointed. Where this really earns points is in the small stuff. The character development of the two leads is pretty solid. This doesn't turn every role into an irritating and over-the-top parody of a type, expecting that everyone supposedly knows someone just like that. It gets other things right that simply aren't a given in pictures like this today. As I was quite certain from the trailer(believe me, it's worse than it was in the previews), the comedy hardly ever gets it quite right. Timing, the material itself, other factors, a combination, I don't know. It certainly is forced and often tries too hard. The theater I went to was a quarter of the way full or so, and laughs were extremely sporadic at best. Dialog is Seinfeld-style. You know: ""The pilots are dead."" ""They're dead?"" ""Shot."" ""Shot? Who shot them?"" ""I did."" ""You shot the pilots?"" Paraphrasing a tad, but you get the idea. While I don't care much for it on that show either, Jerry and co. definitely do better at it than this does. This is never boring. There is a nice amount of action(keeping in mind that it isn't a pure entry into that genre, they fit in jokes, as well), and somewhere between half and three fourths of it is effective, exciting and fun. This takes us to a few exotic locations, and it's all filmed well. FX are largely great, keeping to the background and not stealing the focus. The story is predictable, not to be confused with dull. There are plenty of clichés, and this seldom surprises you. The ending is dumb and unsubstantiated, not to say that it isn't satisfying enough and it is one of the things where the setup and payoff are both present, and that goes for about two thirds(I swear I'm not trying to jampack this review with math) of it all. The acting isn't bad, especially Cruise and Diaz. Is Roy Miller a particularly impressive, strong American name? It was also Matt Damon's in Green Zone. The guns in this are relatively cool. This was directed by the man behind Walk The Line, Girl, Interrupted, and those were well-done and 3:10 to Yuma(that I hear is marvelous), if he did do Identity(well, I guess nobody's perfect). Did I love this? No. Did I enjoy it, and was it a fine distraction for 100 or so minutes? Yes. There is some blood and mild violence in this, and a little swearing(rare enough that it sticks out like a sore thumb in most cases). I recommend it to anyone hungry for a Summer blockbuster that have already taken in the considerably more endorphin-endorsing The A-Team. 7/10",Knight and Day

Of course, there's a bit more behind it than that and, of course, June turns out to have latent skills, and of course a relationship starts to develop (or does it?).Knight and Day (I can see where the Knight comes from, although blink and you'll miss it, but I still don't know about the Day bit) badly wants to be True Lies - both are predicated on secret agent with civilian woman involved in a caper, both have a woman losing control when firing an automatic weapon, both have a scene of amusing responses while under the influence of a truth drug, both have a sexy bit (Cameron Diaz in a brief red bikini which nearly invalidates the movie's 12 certificate), and so on. But Knight And Day never quite works.There's quite a lot which does - the action set pieces are mostly fun and fine: totally improbable, but that's par for the course, Cruise and Diaz have good on-screen chemistry, and Diaz is absolutely delightful (if somewhat unbelievable).I think the problem lies with Cruise's Ray. The character is so relentlessly good humoured as he happily demolishes property and takes multiple lives (most of whom are, admittedly, trying to take his) that he comes across as manic, and all too believably having a psychotic episode (which, per the plot, may well be the case). Things don't hang together as well as they did in True Lies, and there are an awful lot of unanswered questions (not least of which is where June keeps getting complete new wardrobes from).If you are a demanding movie watcher, this film is going to really annoy you.

24,ferguson-6,"Safety, Security, Stupidity",3,28 June 2010,"Greetings again from the darkness. I really liked director James Mangold's two most recent films - Walk the Line, and 3:10 to Yuma. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz both have great smiles and look really good in swim attire. Paul Dano (There Will Be Blood, Little Miss Sunshine) is well cast as an off-center nerdy scientist. That's the end of all the positive comments I have for this film.The negative comments are for just about everything else in this summer ""blockbuster"". It is billed as an Action-Comedy. There is plenty of action, though much of it is so far-fetched and ridiculous. There is almost no comedy. The rapid fire banter between Cruise and Diaz would have been much more effective had it been well written.A quality action movie needs a real force coming from the bad guy. Here, the filmmakers instead provide us with a ""is he a good guy or a bad guy"" story line with Cruise. Anyone surprised at the real answer? Because of that, we don't have anyone to root against. Some generic Spainish arms dealer played by Jordi Molla (Blow) and the government agent played generically by Peter Saarsgard. Generic is not a word you want associated with your movie.This is Cruise and Diaz together for the first time since the far-superior Vanilla Sky. They both deserve better than this slop, though I feel confident they had a good time with the globe-trotting to Spain, Austria, Jamaica and a few U.S. stops in between.

Having had the Blu-Ray for years,I decided it was finally time to take on the knight.View on the film:Bolted together by 12 different writers (but due to the Writers Guild of America,only one was allowed to get the official credit)the screenplay jumps over the huge coincidences for June and Roy's constant run-ins with a nifty romantic Thriller that hammers the house of cards of Roy's criss-crossing between the underworld and the intelligence services, with June increasingly moving in synch with Roy's fighting moves across the globe.Revealed in the making of by cinematographer Phedon Papamichael that the locations in Austria they had been doing two months of pre-production to film at,all got dropped just 12 hours before shooting was to start.Thankfully, director James Mangold reunites with cinematographer Papamichael and keeps the production troubles off screen with a glossy jet-set Caper atmosphere powered by stylish long gliding panning shots sweeping across city to city keeping up with the couple on the run. Keeping the thrills to being as practical as possible, Mangold charges up explosive Action set-pieces with sharp push-ins on Roy unleashing deadly take downs.Performing most of the stunts themselves,Tom Cruise & Cameron Diaz give sparkling turns as odd couple Roy and June, as Diaz brings out a fish out of water comedic charm to June finding herself caught in the middle of the action, as Cruise has Roy take down all would-be assassins with a slick casualness every knight and day.",Knight and Day
26,anaconda-40658,This Film Should Never See Night or Day.,4,2 July 2015,"Knight and Day (2010): Dir: James Mangold / Cast: Tom Cruise, Cameron Diaz, Paul Dano, Peter Sargaard, Viola Davis: High spirited action film that relies heavily upon its appealing stars to carry it. Title poises little description of this improbable action comedy. Tom Cruise plays a spy who involved Cameron Diaz in a life threatening scheme involving a battery when they ""bump"" into each other at the airport. Director James Mangold is backed by tremendous production and thrilling action that makes little sense. He has directed superior films such as Walk the Line and Copland. Cruise is excellent playing the confident spy who holds charm and wit in the palm of his hand while also happily being outwitted by his female companion. Diaz is a great foil who wakes up in no less than three locations after being drugged. Her life was normal until her sudden encounter with Cruise. From there her life is in fast paced turmoil until she eventually must master it. Paul Dano has a superb supporting role as the battery inventor who is kidnapped but ultimately manages to remain one step ahead. Other roles are basically props for silly action including a stampede of bulls. Peter Sargaard plays a predicted villain because, I suppose, casting directors feel that he fits the profile. Viola Davis also has a cardboard role as a CIA representative whose importance is the standard bull. The action is entertaining and well executed while the screenplay is mindless yet contains its share of plot turns to keep action lovers interested or involved. Otherwise this is a pointless action no brainer. Score: 4 ½ / 10",Knight and Day
27,FlashCallahan,with me...without me....,6,28 June 2010,"Tom Cruise is back in another summer movie that is high on action and low on plot hole filler.Diaz is on board to assist as the female sidekick. Have you seen Mr and Mrs Smith? Have you seen Mission Impossible 2? Have you seen True Lies? If you enjoyed these three movies, you will get something out of this.The film centres around a Macguffin known as the battery, which offers something to someone, and Cruise has his hands on it. He meets Diaz, Crash lands a plane, and spouts a one liner. Hilarity ensues.This carries on for the majority of the film, with Diaz falling more an more for Cruise, one scene that for any person who has 1% knowledge of movies, knows that Cruise isn't dead, and other set pieces being ripped off from other movies.But it's not bad. For one, it's a summer movie, so all reality is thrown out of the window, because it's a star vehicle, and the makers know, that it will make some money.The plane sequence isn't as exciting as the makers would like it to be. In all fairness, it's quite silly, but it's the poorest part of the film.The warehouse scene is taken directly from Mr and Mrs Smith and True Lies respectively. The train scene has connotations toward Ubder Siege 2, and the bike set piece is totally ripped of from tomorrow Never dies.But Cruise is great as always and lifts the film from absurdity. It's fun while it lasts but it's nothing memorable. The editing is slick as are the effects, although you feel that Cruise had some say, because when ever he does a huge jump or something dangerous, his head/body is put seamlessly on the screen (MI:2 is so ten years ago).It's great for a first date movie, it goes along at a steady pace and isn't offensive, but than again so was six days and seven nights.It's a summer movie of the highest order, and one of those movies that won't hold a special place in anyones heart who loves high concept.See it, feel guilty about seeing it, but enjoy it.It's not trying to be anything it isn't.",Knight and Day
28,gradyharp,Jolly Good Action/Romance/Comedy/Entertainment,8,1 December 2010,"KNIGHT AND DAY as written by Patrick O'Neill and directed by James Mangold is a terrific escapist diversion of a film. No, it is not a great movie worthy of Oscar attention nor does it pretend to be. This is just a fast moving, clever, surprising, high-speed chase of a spy thriller that provides two hours of fine entertainment. Roy Miller (Tom Cruise, back in his element) is a spy on the run, attempting to prevent the European bad guys (headed by Jordi Mollà) from capturing a new battery of endless life and power created by nerdy student Simon Feck (Paul Dano). In the film's opening segments Roy meets the beautiful June Havens (Cameron Diaz) while boarding a plane and from this innocent beginning Cruise and Diaz begin a treacherous ride through airplane hijacking, explosions, car chases, captures and gun battles - all the while Diaz' June appears to have no clue to the magnitude of the situation. The confusing aspect of June's dilemma is her instructions by the FBI (Peter Sarsgaard, Viola Davis et al) to avoid contact with Roy who they claim is psychotic. The film delves into family (Celia Weston as Roy's Mother, Maggie Grace as June's soon-to-be-wed sister, and the always excellent Marc Blucas as June's old fireman boyfriend), falling in love, and the underside of government intervention and just seems to have a ball with every twist in the story. Cruise and Diaz create a terrific screen presence - two actors who understand drama and comedy and romance - and they are supported by an exceptional cast. This is a well-made film on every level and should be watched for the fun of it! Grady Harp",Knight and Day
29,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Knight and Day,8,27 June 2010,"What a rush! Knight and Day delivers the quintessential summer blockbuster through a perfectly delivered adrenaline ride with big names, action and comedy put together. Honestly The Killers, in a similarly positioned film with the alpha-male and the ditzy blonde pairing have paled in comparison with the real deal now on our shores, and it had likely boiled down to the star power that Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz still command in this part of the world, if sold out attendances here are any indication.James Mangold's filmography currently covers a wide range of genres, and this experience had benefited him since Knight and Day contains plenty all rolled into one, with action, comedy, science fiction and even serious drama all included. The story really is quite flimsy, if not for the constant twists and turns that actually put you in the driver's seat and engage you in wondering who's who, and what's what, and just whose account you can trust, that of the suave spy, or the girl in shock, or how about the authorities for that matter.And success was due in part to comedy no less. Tom Cruise had shown that he's adapt at being a comedic actor, with his now iconic Les Grossman from Tropic Thunder being the most memorable. He's not pushover as the action hero, though it's actually been-there-done-that territory as Roy Miller, who possesses this streak of recklessness balanced with expertise and superhuman abilities, who never seems to be putting in the wrong foot. Always seeming to be one step ahead of the game, you'll be constantly positioned to question his motives, his intent and wonder whether Miller is good, bad, or straddling both sides as a double agent.Cameron Diaz on the other hand with her sunshine smile and demeanour, makes for that perfect eye-candy from whom we follow the proceedings, where her June Havens bumps into Miller at the airport, and following what she thought could be an opportunity for romance, soon finds herself wanted by a clandestine organization, shady underworld dealers, and somehow being doggedly in pursuit by Miller. She has no idea what's going on and it is precisely us following this huge question mark that proves to be half the fun.Cruise and Diaz share great chemistry together, and it's been quite a long time since they're last pairing together under limited screen time in Cameron Crowe's Vanilla Sky, where the highlight of their scene was in a car careening off at high speeds. And it's no different here as well, with their best scenes almost always involving planes, trains and automobiles, including a high speed Ducarti chase with jeeps and bulls even through the busy streets in Spain. Action here is all non-flashy, but has enough pizazz to thrill and put you at the edge of your seat.The one action sequence that stood out was the chase down the highway where Miller rescues Havens with the sheer audacity of taking on an army of agents in a convoy of vehicles with shootouts, blowouts, and impossibly executed stunts if not for computer technology. But not everything's quite polished in the film, and the special effects were alarmingly raw for certain scenes, where you can spot the obvious superimposition. The other surprise was a narrative one, which allowed for sticky situations to be explained away, for deft defying escapes to be done without being shown, with cheats applied through fade to blacks. Which is a pity because Tom Cruise obviously did some, if not most of his own stunts to make his character look the convincing bad-ass he is with the fluid leaps and jumps.Still the film worked, with supporting characters like a very restrained Peter Sarsgaard, and an almost unrecognizable Paul Dano playing quite one-dimensional roles. Ultimately it boiled down to Cruise and Diaz playing to their strengths, and the other major plus point would be the original music by John Powell, which jazzed this film up and added another dimension to this action-comedy. This is a definite winner in this year's rather dismal summer season thus far.",Knight and Day
30,SimonJack,One of the better non-stop action thrillers,8,11 October 2019,"""Knight and Day"" is one of the modern fast action, thrill-a-minute films that has become a staple in a more frenzied world. The appeal of most of these films is the action of the hero. Most don't have very plausible scenarios at all, and they generally have screenplays of the same caliber.For some reason, I enjoyed this shoot-em-up, smash-bang, adrenaline pumping film more than most. Tom Cruise does very well as the ""super"" hero here. His fast moves, defenses and physical feats are very good. Toss in his occasional quips for some humor and his Roy Miller is quite entertaining. The latter aspect sort of renders the fear and worry that Cameron Diaz shows at times, as unbelievable.This is the kind of film when one can enjoy the action, and film production talents, however far-fetched and unreal the action and scenes might be. It's one off the better films of the early 21st century in the non-stop action film category.",Knight and Day

At no moment in the film did I feel that this could be remotely possible, therefore the whole thing is nothing but an action fairy-tale. The action was good, though, excepting the ludicrous CGI, and the actors were decent for their roles. That being said, the roles were less than cardboard, resembling some insane cartoon that made no sense except in wishful- thinking-land.Bottom line: There is this ""leave your brain at the door"" saying.

32,Smells_Like_Cheese,"""I shot the first pilot then he accidentally shot the second pilot. It's just one of those things""",6,24 June 2010,"As you know from my reviews, I hate romantic comedies. Especially PG-13 one's that refuse to take any risks what-so-ever and are so family friendly that it becomes ridicules. But when I see stronger performers like Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz, I have a little more faith. Now granted, not the best actors of our time, but I'd rather see them than Ashton Kutcher and Katherine Heigl. So I wanted to give this movie a very fair chance and over all as predictable and stupid as it was, I still had a good time watching it. There were some really stupid moments, but if something is funny, why not laugh? Tom Cruise is great at playing this smooth killer agent and Cameron Diaz was also good as the naive bystander who just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time when she meets him. What makes this film work in my opinion is the chemistry between Cruise and Diaz, they have worked together before in Vanilla Sky. I thought they were pretty decent together then and now they're showing that they can really work together well in a film. They made this stupid story work.Roy Miller and June Havens bump into each other twice at the airport. Completely taken with Miller, Havens goes to the restroom; and the remaining passengers all attack Roy, he calmly informs June that everyone on the plane is dead, including the pilots. Believing it a joke, Junr plays along until Roy enters the cockpit. Crashing into a corn field, Miller delivers Havens home after drugging her and explaining that other agents will visit and that they are planning to kill or imprison her. The next day June is picked up by a group of intelligence agents. Roy arrives and, through a long gunfight on the highway, kills several agents and saves June. Roy explains that June is safer with him; and she agrees to follow him as they go to pick up Simon Feck, a genius inventor who created a perpetual energy battery called the Zephyr. As it turns out that Roy is being framed by his former partner saying that he will sell the Zephyr to terrorists. But June must figure out who she can trust in this crazy situation.While the story is beyond predictable and we have to have a lot of suspension in disbelief with it as well, I think it's something you can enjoy if you just let go and have a good time. I hate saying this as you know how I feel about this genre of romantic comedy. But it's one of those movies you could get a very good chuckle out of. I loved the scene where Cameron is taken by the FBI for the first time and she gets into a nasty car chase as people are shooting at her and Cruise just lands on top of her car like it's something he does every day and just talks to her calmly. Also the scene between her, her ex boyfriend and Cruise in the diner was very funny. Like I said, it's the actors that make this lousy story work, even if the characters are under developed. I think this movie is an example of mindless fun, so just let go and have fun with this one.6/10",Knight and Day

But it did have a lot of it's moments and was pretty fun to watch, although predictable, it was somewhat fun to watch. Now when viewing this film, I highly recommend you take the stuff that happens in this for what it is, cause there is no logic and is just preposterous at times. If you thought ""The A-Team"" (2010) was preposterous, this movie is way more absurd and stupid and yet entertaining at least for the most part, especially the first half. And Tom Cruise is back to his charming old school character style in this, which is a plus cause he was likable in this. Cameron Diaz looked old as hell in this, especially cause she tries to act really young with that bubbly personality thing going. Anyways yeah it's a absurd movie, but the first half of this was a lot of fun, just wished the second half was as good as the first half cause it turns into a very generic action movie and felt like the pacing slowed down in a negative way. Some people didn't really like the blackout parts of it where one of the character falls unconscious and the other character gets away some how without explaining, but I didn't really mind. The highly trained agent sticking with just a regular person has been done before, but I liked the direction this one went, at least for the most part. Not great, but it's a mindless fun.6.8/10",Knight and Day
35,thesar-2,Open your mind - see this either during the day or night,9,4 July 2010,"The mere title of Cruise's latest feature pretty much explains movie star Cruise and what people think they know of his private life: Knight and Day.When Mission: Impossible III came out in 2006, it immediately followed his so-called ""media meltdown"" and people had really rough opinions about him and voiced them with the low box-office returns. I could seriously care less about his couch jumping/pill opinions and went to see not only the best Mission: Impossible of the series (so far,) but a very good movie.It wasn't his politics that kept me away from his follow-up (unfortunate bomb/) movies: Lion for Lambs and Valkyrie, it was simply that I had no interest in the subject matter. I'm open to watch them some day, but not at the top of my list. I did, however see him in Tropic Thunder and applaud him for a fantastic break-away from the norm, though it was a short stint in the movie.Who gives a sh#t what happened four years ago on the show, Oprah, that should've ended 10 years prior? So, he has an opinion about prescription drugs? Please tell me your opinions are not only rational, but the great majority of the world agrees with you – and that's not saying they're right if anyone agrees. I don't. His movies have almost always entertained me – the majority was when he finally broke free of the typecast he acted his way in, in A Few Good Men, even though there were a few I liked prior.Cruise is a talented and gifted performer, and in Knight and Day he shinedin spades. He had a quick wit and floated/acted his way through this movie with the confidence I love to see in him, i.e. who cares what people think – this is what I do best. And believe me, he was awesome to watch.He cracked me up, made his ""lucky"" spy shots actually believable and was just as suave as any James Bond or, even, Ethan Hunt. Further, he had wonderful chemistry with the lead lady, Diaz, who had her turn at making us laugh and root for her – despite all her imperfections. That said, who probably wouldn't act like she did, given the circumstances a normal person was through into. Diaz was beautiful as ever and could match Cruise step by step, though you could tell Cruise was leading their tango both on and off the screen.Knight and Day follows the traditional Scarecrow & Mrs. King route where a super-spy uses and rescues a civilian who ends up getting just as tangled in the web of the espionage as the agent, himself. Nothing is coincidental for rogue spy Roy (Cruise); he's always in control and always adapts to his surroundings with the ease of a soaring eagle.Unfortunately for June (Diaz,) she's instantly smitten with a ""chance encounter"" (like I said) at the airport with Roy. Yada, yada, yadathey both go down in a plane crash and the impossible mission begins involving a Duracell the size of a cricket and the power of Godzilla.Obviously, it's not shocker that some people want this device and are, gasp!, willing to kill for it. Nor is it a spoiler that states there's gotta be a mole who our hero is trying to expose – oh, no! Lovable (very true, when it comes to his charismatic character – thanks Cruise) and undeniably patient Roy is the movie's Superman to June's Lois. She's always in peril, and he's always there to literally scoop her up, save the day and do best for her and his mission.This movie, for the most part is silly, unrealistic and contains a few too many noticeable CGI segments. In addition, it gets a little slow when it goes off the beaten path when the plot (needs) calls for June to get jealous.That said, I could forgive all that becauseit was just too much fun. I laughed out loud and thoroughly enjoyed myself with the banter, excellently paced quick jabs and one-liners and the secondary characters that will through you for a loop. (No, not the spies, I'm referring to a couple from Roy's past.)Aside from the aforementioned one scene of jealous – and again, it was a needed element, the movie never ever goes off track. It's silly in moment one through to the (unfortunately) predictable, though satisfying, closing. I have NO problem with a movie that's complete off its rocker, as long as it doesn't pretend or yearn to be something else. A perfect example was a definite lesser movie than Knight and Day, but it was what it was throughout: Ninja Assassin. Stay true Hollywood and you will gain more confidence (Cruise doesn't need that advice, he's as good as he ever was) and will gain praise for it, given people opening their minds.So, you have to know what you're getting into; this spy movie is unlike the Bourne Movies, James Bond films or any serious espionage genre. It's played as a fun summer ride, an obvious romance story with thrills, close calls that couldn't possible happen outside the desire for entertaining the audience.And sh#t. Me and the audience were thoroughly wowed. SEE IT!Disclaimer: Yeah, I swore. Sue me. It was to exclaim my love for this adventurous roller coaster fun ride. At least, I didn't jump up and down on a couchoops, sorry about that one. Cruise: I still love yah. Please keep making movies. Please continue to entertain.",Knight and Day
36,Robert_duder,Big potential but falls just shy of being a real blockbuster,7,21 August 2010,"Take your shots at me now but I still like Tom Cruise. I don't care about his personal life or opinions, I think he is still a movie star and while he hasn't had a lot of truly great roles lately he is still one of my favourites. This was really a good part for him, funny, action packed, spoofing his own previous spy films. The film tries to balance humour, spoof and action and sometimes succeeds but unfortunately stumbles a lot too which is unfortunate. This could have jump started a real force in a series of films. We don't get a lot of buddy films anymore that are worthwhile. While the film travels from the U.S. to Pacific Islands to Europe and beyond the problem is that it moves too quickly. Its like a slide show of locations and doesn't give you enough time to truly understand and appreciate the location of the film and what is happening. Some of the more intense action scenes happen so quickly that you just get the adrenaline running before it ends and moves on to something else. I think honestly they pack three Bourne films into one two hour comedy and it doesn't always work but I wanted it to and I was still entertained by it.As mentioned Tom Cruise fits this role well. I could see how some would think that Cruise acts vapid and empty in this role but I think you have to look at it from a funny spoof angle. He's poking fun at the James Bond/Spy persona and does great at it. He has dead pan humour and delivery and it actually is one of the high points of the film and he looks great! I have never been a huge Cameron Diaz fan but she does have her moments. I'm still not sure if she was right for the movie or not. Her and Cruise have good chemistry but I don't think its great enough to hold this film together the way it should. One of the biggest issues is that they really rush the romance and you don't get to see it develop. Still she is good in the role. One thing is for sure this is a Tom Cruise/Cameron Diaz vehicle. The supporting cast are absolutely nothing more than to support the two of them in a big way. Peter Sarsgaard, Viola Davis, Paul Dano, and Marc Blucas are four of the smaller supporting characters that really deserve mention in their roles.Director James Mangold is a great director. He proved that with the superb Walk The Line and even great films like Identity, Girl Interrupted...heck even Kate and Leopold was a fun movie. However, the issue is that I'm not sure the choice in director was right for this film. I think someone with perhaps a better hold on action films would have been better. John McTiernan could have turned this into a force to be reckoned with. So ultimately while the film is fun and footloose and fancy free I think there is too much at once, and perhaps the writers, and creators got excited and carried away and tried to get everything they wanted into it. Perhaps a directors cut is due that would help move things a long better. However, give this one a chance because while it isn't the best summer blockbuster it is worth seeing on a cold winter night...or day...see what I did there? 7/10",Knight and Day
37,bowmanblue,Not as bad as you've probably heard,7,22 August 2016,"Okay, so 'Knight and Day' had some pretty big expectations on its shoulders – basically, anything carrying such star power as Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz is going to be a massive hit, right? After all, look how well 'The Tourist' turned out for Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie! Yes, Tom and Cameron are great actors who can both carry a movie. Yes, they do have chemistry. And, yes, they're always going to attract the public. But will the overall package attract enough of the public to make the film the serious money it needs? The answer is: sort of.Possibly the first problem the film runs into is that it's hardly a new premise. Jason Bourne has been doing those 'innocent-spy-on-the-run' movies for years, so the fat that Tom Cruise is a super-secret agent who's wrongly accused of a crime he didn't commit is nothing new. Plus, wasn't that the plot for at least two Mission Impossible films?! Then you have the fact that the film doesn't really know what it wants to be. Tom Cruise provides the action, whereas as Cameron Diaz is more suited for quirky romantic-comedy movies. Therefore you're left with a weird blend between the two.It's an odd sort of film that doesn't really know what it wants to be. I found I sometimes didn't know whether I was supposed to be laughing or getting pumped up at the amazing set-piece car chases and punch-ups.However, it did make money. As I've said before both leads have legions of fans. It is nice to see the two of them together and it's their chemistry which does save the production. It's certainly no classic and if you're into your serious spy movies then this one isn't for you. However, if you like one or both leading actors then you should wring enough charm out of the story to keep you happy for a couple of hours. It's one of those films where renting or streaming is certainly more rewarding that paying full price for the experience on Blu-ray!",Knight and Day
38,dromasca,a welcome lighter touch,6,1 October 2011,"'Knight and Day' was one of the 2010 summer blockbusters. With a plot line that is one of the less credible action stories ever seen on screens there was not much alternative left for director James Mangold but to play on the combination between the special effects and the charm and chemistry of the two mega-stars in the cast - Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. To a great extent he succeeded.There can be no pretensions of credibility in a plot in which in order to get hold of a device the size of a battery (oh, it is actually a battery!) the bad guys simply make so that a whole commercial flight is populated by their men - passengers, pilots, stewardesses with the exception of our heroes, of course, who will kill everybody and land the plane relatively safely with no prior training or book of instructions. So as a viewer you better focus on the well choreographed actions scenes and on the ever changing landscape, with countries and continents changing at a pace that would make the envy of James Bond.While actions scenes are good, they are not enough to explain that this film has charm and humor and makes for a good entertainment. The rest is especially added by the performances given by Cruise and Diaz, who enjoy themselves and seem to enjoy working with each other. The two actors are towards the end of the period when they can play the action people with romantic interest, Cruise is doing it for 25 years (since 'Legend' and 'Top Gun' more precisely) and Diaz for a shorter period, but it may be one of their last occasions for such casting. The film does not take itself too serious at any moment and this is why we can enjoy its lighter touch.",Knight and Day
39,MLDinTN,silly action adventure that some what works,6,5 June 2011,"This movie was a little better than I expected it to be. I thought it would be one of those totally ridiculous action movies with corny jokes and lead actors that have no chemistry and a dumb story. Well, it does have some very silly action scenes ( such as Roy on top of a car without holding on and not falling off, or how about when he just shows up on the hood of the car, or escaping a fighter jet on a really tiny island, or on a motorcycle at top speed avoiding bulls and everything else). But, what was surprising was that Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise had some chemistry on screen and it just wasn't completely awkward. The plot made sense and didn't just come up with crazy twists.It's light hearted with comedy thrown in. I mean when June is in the bathroom on the plane and Roy is killing all the would be killers and not a clue what's going on. That was funny. As well as every time she was drugged and would wake up in different countries.FINAL VERDICT: Worth a viewing for the action fan.",Knight and Day

They have great chemistry with each other. Each also delivered a few funny lines.Overall, this is a fun summer movie.

43,CuriosityKilledShawn,Physics: Impossible,6,12 March 2012,"Knight and Day was cursed with a zillion rewrites and many years in development hell before it came to the big screen. It shows. Boy, does it show. Everything in the film is so half-assed, superficial, and disposable that's it barely able to stand on its own two feet. Thankfully, the 'star power' of Cruise and Diaz, now pushing the end of their prime and peak, keep it interesting enough.June is a ditzy blonde (a dangerous new role for Diaz!) who meets Ryan (why does Tom cruise?) at the airport. She is immediately smitten by him and is caught up in a whirlwind of adventure, leading from one ludicrous set-piece to the next, chasing a token MacGuffin, and avoiding a lame CIA bad guy (a quickly-aging Peter Sarsgaard). It's never boring, but the action is the usual post-modern trash with stutter cuts and impossible physics that do not once excite or take your breath away.The 'CIA Bad Guy' plot is so old it knew the dinosaurs. The Agent-gone-rogue crap was the story behind Mission: Impossibles 1-3 (and in an inverse sense M:I 4 also), as well as 5 Bond movies and all of the Jason Bournes. Puh-lease give us something new. Knight and Day (a stupid, virtually meaningless title) had about 50 people draft the script. I do realize it's hard to conjure up genuine intrigue and plot twists but if you can't do it then you're not much of a writer. Probably why Hollywood loves you then.An inoffensive timewaster. Do not go out of your way to see it.",Knight and Day
44,inkblot11,"Bright and playful, how I wish I had seen it sooner, its sooooo fun! Cruise is truly terrific and Diaz is good, too",8,26 August 2010,"June (Cameron Diaz) gets bumped. Three times, no less. She's at the airport and a handsome stranger, Roy (Tom Cruise), collides with her twice while she is making her way to the boarding gate. Huh. Then, she gets bumped from her flight to Boston, where she is to try on her bridesmaids gown for sissy's wedding. Unbelievable, she is given a ticket to another flight, which also happens to include Roy. There are very few other passengers so the two engage in a ""getting to know you"" conversation. Yet, when June heads to the restroom, all heck breaks lose, with Roy killing the entire run of passengers and flight crew. Whatsa up? Well, as Roy explains to a terrified June, once she gets out of the can, he's a secret U.S. spy and his agency is out to get him, for they believe he is a traitor. Roy lands the plane roughly in a cornfield and drugs June to clean up the mess and get her back home. But, things don't end there. The government agents, including Fitzgerald (Peter Sarsgaard) and his boss (Viola Davis), are still after Roy and now want June, too. A new invention and its young inventor are also targets, items Roy is trying to protect. Roy makes it clear to June that if she joins him, she might live but, otherwise she will be in constant jeopardy. Hopping planes, trains, automobiles, and motorcycles, and going from country to country in Europe, will this new duo stay kicking and breathing? And, will love spring forth between the agent and his damsel in distress? Wow, this film was a real kick, it was sooooo much fun, and this viewer is sorry she didn't buy a ticket sooner. Cruise, by the way, looks and acts great in a role that mimics James Bond but is far quirkier. Diaz, too, is fun as the lady caught in a web of intrigue and Sarsgaard, Davis, and all of the others do a fine job, also. Also adding to the film's enormous pleasure is the knockout, gorgeous settings and the clever, inspired editing. One would find it difficult to locate a movie with better scenery or camera work in 2010. Of course, the costumes, polished script and energetic direction are big bonuses as well.

Evidently danger lurks around every corner, but Miller is unflappable. He is like James Bond, except he keeps his mind on the task at hand, not easily distracted by a beautiful woman.There is excellent interplay between the two main characters, which gives the film appeal and allows the viewer to become involved in the action. In that sense it reminds me of ""The Thomas Crown Affair"".We expect Cruise to handle the physicality of a role. Diaz holds up her end as well, contributing substantially to the action scenes. In addition, she displays the charm of, say , Goldie Hawn.This film deserves a high rating because the characters are so likable and the action is fun to watch.",Knight and Day
47,tabuno,Fun Summer Entertainment,7,18 January 2019,"2 July 2010. The over the top action seemed to take away from this action, comedy thriller. The beginning sequences of this movie, however, were quite exhilarating not for the action, but for the close up facial shots of Cruise and Diaz in non-verbal human expressions that are rarely shot in these movies and made for some pretty fascinating cerebral contemplation and interaction not seen usually in such action comedies. The use of the unconscious scenes while interesting and also not often used while having a consistent theme and use at times were not well edited leaving the audience wondering about what and how the characters were able to accomplish what they did. The action thrill ride nevertheless was funny, captivating, and had the usual relatively predictable twists and turns that were captured in a slightly involving way, if not any spectacular. The movie really was a decent, entertaining summer movie, above average, and worth the ticket price though it won't win any awards.",Knight and Day
48,The-Sarkologist,"Good to watch once, but that is it",6,31 May 2013,"I look at the comment below about how Tom Cruise butchered the reviewer's opinion of this movie. Personally I cannot really agree with him, though this movie is one that one can watch and enjoy, but not really think too deeply about.Anyway, June Havens (Cameron Diaz) is getting onto a plane to fly to her sister's wedding when she bumps into Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) and from there she is thrust into an adventure involving spies and super technology that everybody is trying to get for themselves. From that point on it is just an action ride to the end with a few breathers in between. However there are a number of things in this movie that simply did not enable me to suspend my disbelief.First, they are traveling down a freeway when all of the sudden the driver dies and they find themselves driving up the wrong side of the freeway. How did that happen. While it is possible to drift onto the wrong side of a freeway in the country, that simply is not possible in the middle of the city. The barrier pretty much prevents you from doing that. Secondly, at the beginning of the movie she needs to get onto the plane to get to her sister's wedding, which seems to be happening the next day, but almost a week passes before the wedding actually happens.That is my gripe, but the interesting thing about the movie is how they used a drugged state to quickly pass through a number of parts of the movie. She is drugged in a field after the plane crashes and wakes up in her bed. She is also drugged in a prison, has some flashes of her escaping, and then wakes up on an island. This happens a third time and she wakes up on a train in the middle of Europe. It became difficult to follow at that point, but it was still a good movie, but not in the sense that it is deep and meaningful, but rather simply an action flick.I doubt I would go out of my way to watch it again.",Knight and Day
49,Floated2,Was expecting more..a lot more!,3,21 September 2010,"The tale begins at the Wichita airport, where we meet June and learn exactly two things about her: first, that she restores vintage muscle cars (so males in the audience will find her irresistible); and second, that she has a bad case of little-sister-getting-married-before-her. On her way through security, June repeatedly runs into Roy, himself a fetching grin sandwiched between windbreaker and sunglasses. June is bumped from her flight but is subsequently put back on it, only to discover there are just a handful of passengers on the plane, Roy included. (The reasons for June's bumping and de-bumping are obscure, an early sign that the screenplay--credited to newcomer Patrick O'Neill, but subsequently rewritten by half a dozen others) June and Roy flirt lightly until she visits the lavatory, at which point the other passengers, along with both pilots and the navigator, all try to assassinate Roy. Happily, he is much better at this kind of thing than they are, so he kills them instead, crash lands the jet himself, warns June about the nameless baddies who will soon come looking, and gently drugs her. She wakes the next morning in her own bed, with friendly Roy-notes offering life-saving advice scattered around her apartment.To describe such plotting as ridiculous might sprain the term itself. Yet, for those of generous spirit and easily suspended disbelief (you may wish to re-read the previous paragraph before deciding whether you qualify), the first few reels of Knight and Day offer a kind of giddy, kinetic nonsense. The two (Cruise & Diaz) are even supplied with a handful of moderately inspired gags, the best of which doubles as an ingenious way to cut down on the studio costs of a big aerial escape scene. As backup, Peter Sarsgaard, Viola Davis, and Paul Dano offer above-average spins on the Scheming Turncoat, the Hardnosed Spymaster, and the Good-Natured Geek, respectively.But in the end--or, rather, by the midpoint--it's not enough. Over time, the script's internal confusions become too vivid to ignore. (In particular, a subplot in which Roy, ostensibly for June's safety, contrives to have her captured by the very people he has claimed want her dead, achieves a level of logic-melting idiocy.) Worse, nearly every half-memorable joke in the film is told a second time, and in some cases a third--a textbook demonstration that recycling is not always a virtue.What is perhaps most dispiriting about Knight and Day is what it suggests about Hollywood and the comedy-thriller-romance subgenre. Knight and Day, fails more typically. Nimble enough on its feet when cars are crashing and bullets whizzing--Cruise and Diaz's best scenes almost all take advantage of the incongruity of conversation at such moments--it has no idea at all what a man and woman might talk about when deprived of such violent backdrops. When the action slows, the dialogue, which ought to pick up pace, stalls as well. (""Fitz set me up.... That's when I met you,"" he tells her; ""Who are you, really?"" she asks him. ""No one follows up or I kill myself than her"")",Knight and Day

During their getaway trip they travel through the world, mainly America and Europe, in order to help Roy clean his name. The first part of the movie was boring, even though there was much action going on. Scenes are being repeated, as well as lines, and the story is still confusing. However, fortunately, it gets better. The scenery is great, the action scenes are entertaining, even the dialogs are funny. But the end is disappointing.

51,TheMovieDiorama,Knight and Day is teeming with forgettable energy that will only last the day and night of you seeing this.,5,18 May 2018,"Vanilla Sky 2? Hmm...maybe not. Charlie's Angel? Nope, not feeling that either. Mission Impossible 4.5? Getting warmer. Tom Cruise: Typical Action Movie 9? Much better! I mean what do you expect Cruise to be doing in an action blockbuster other than shooting enemies, riding a motorbike in the middle of Sevilla with Diaz on top on him, jumping off cars in rush hour and well...just being himself. Nothing new here. A secret agent is on the run from the CIA who are tasked with obtaining Zephyr, a modernised perpetual energy battery. An innocent woman boarding a flight gets caught up in the shenanigans...and so the mindless action commences. This is easily Mangold's weakest directorial effort. I appreciate the buoyancy of his style, the pace and narrative felt light as it speeds along a nearly two hour runtime. The action set pieces and sequences were executed cleanly, maintaining frantic chaos with subtle visual comedy that is accompanied by Powell's Parisian score. Cruise commits to the stunts and explosive action as always, which is the primary appeal for this films. His chemistry with Diaz is perfectly satisfactory as the two bounce off each other well. However, no film will convince me that Diaz is a good actress. Again, like her previous credits, she overacts every little emotion. Shocked? She'll start screaming flailing her arms around. Sad? She'll drop to the floor in a puddle of tears. Happy? She'll laugh for about an hour. I just can't warm to her, it's all so false. The plot is a typical formulaic secret agent story where the rapid pacing conceals its genericism. The A-list supporting cast were wasted and sidelined to solely focus on the main stars. And, to top it all, the usage of green screen was highly noticeable and detracts from the production's authenticity. Yet, I simply just cannot hate this film.

54,Chris Knipp,Mission preposterous -- but it's fun,7,23 June 2010,"People will cast around for comparisons to explain what 'Knight and Day' copies most. Is it Brad and Angelina in Mr. and Mrs. Smith? Not really, but certainly dozens of sources have been gleefully plundered. A close comparison is early 'Bourne,' with Diaz's Franka Potente to Cruise's Matt Damon, but with the humor, braggadocio, and indifference to logic of the original James Bond stories.This couple in adversity, like the 'Bourne' one, is a linkage that comes about seemingly by accident when Joan Havens (Diaz) happens to wind up on a nearly empty plane to Kansas City that Roy Miller (Cruise) hijacks, after its crew tries to kill him. Miller is a CIA man, or a former one. He's gone rogue, or so some say. He's also in possession of some kind of inexhaustible energy source MacGuffin thingie created by a brilliant teenager nerd pal of his called Simon Feck (Paul Dano). Naturally everybody wants to get hold of this thingie, and later of young Simon. Sarsgaard is a CIA agent called Fitzgerald who's chasing Roy, and his boss is a black lady called Isabel (Viola Davis). Joan, who rebuilds classic American cars, is on her way to her sister's wedding. The greatest tribute to Roy's skill and a sign of his attention to the human side of things is that he gets her to the wedding, after a few car explosions and chases and dozens of dead bodies. Roy has two main ways of relating to people. He kisses them or he kills them. There isn't time for much else. Cruise carries this off with panache. Diaz is equal to the demands of her role: ditsy -- but glamorous and sexy -- blonde who's also a Charlie's Angel.When the stuff happens on the plane at the beginning, it's not remotely believable. It isn't meant to be. How believable is any blockbuster action? How believable is anything anywhere? 'Knight and Day' establishes right away (watch how the plane rocks when there's turbulence) that this is a garish, over-the-top comedy. The ridiculous opening sequence clearly establishes that this is an outrageous comedy -- and a romance -- as much as it's an actioner. The filmmakers are simply betting that the vivacity of the action and the charm of the stars will get you involved and that involvement will grow rather than diminish as the story progresses. The action is preposterous, but the protagonists are in trouble, so you forget it's silly and start to worry -- but you don't forget to laugh, and you're meant to. The movie manages to ramp up all three aspects and keep the cocktail stirred. This is a shameless effort to appeal simultaneously to three different genre demographics: Comedy, Action, Romance. And it just may succeed.Is this Ron Miller (Tom Cruise) a man on a crucial mission -- or an out-of-control nut case? This is the question this movie poses, and this is a role that both Cruise's friends and his enemies may find appropriate. . . But to stick with this movie and enjoy its wild action-romance-comedy ride, you need to set aside any feelings the actor's couch-jumping antics may have awakened and focus on the great movies he has been in, observe how well he and ace comedienne Cameron Diaz work together, and there's entertainment to be had here.'Knight and Day' is completely empty and pointless, but also quite a lot of fun. It's too long (like so many of the new pictures), and contains such a rich, indigestible mélange of action stuff -- somersaulting cars exploding on highways, shootouts, chases, fires -- and such lush locations, including Pamplona at bull run time, picturesque Austrian towns, Langley, and the Orient Express, you feel overfed. But then you walk out and it's all, pleasantly, forgotten, except for Tom Cruise's manic smile and Cameron Diaz's look of wide-eyed astonishment, which are enough to take home from a summer blockbuster in a season when one of the NY Times' lead critics praises Jonah Hex and Pixar's strung-out third installment of Toy Story is hailed as a masterpiece.Empty of solid content though it may be, 'Knight and Day' succeeds, for one thing, because it does something woefully lacking in today's blockbusters -- alternates the heavy action with quiet times. Here, they're usually romantic pauses, in which the lady (Diaz) changes into something more comfortable. Joe Carnahan, who has a sense of humor and knows his way around tough-guy scenes, should have kept this in mind when he made 'The A-Team,' a movie that never lets up and consequently leaves you just feeling weary. You remember nothing but Liam Neeson puffing on cigars in a movie he should never have been in. 'Knight and Day' has sense enough to give its leads appropriate roles and let you catch your breath every now and then.In development, this movie went through various titles; the one it landed with, 'Knight and Day,' only makes sense at the end and even then won't hit you over the head with its logic. 'K & D' also went through many writers -- at least nine. Considering that, it's a tribute to director and cast that the whole thing hangs together as well as it does and the different sequences don't just feel like pieces in a disassembled puzzle.Tom Cruise's character is invincible and his accidental partner, Joan, tends to get overexcited or lose her ability to cope with the gangs of assassins, the 90-mile-an-hour car chases, and the explosions and Roy resorts to drugging her so he can whisk them both safely away. From being scared and dubious, Joan begins to have more and more confidence in Roy and as this turns to attraction she shows startling abilities of her own: ""you've got skills,"" Roy tells her. Indeed. And however preposterous, so does 'Knight and Day.'",Knight and Day
55,elshikh4,Thin Air !,6,10 July 2010,"It's shown in our cinemas in Egypt under Arabic commercial title that stands for (Explosive Encounter). The theater was half full. During the viewing, the audience chuckled 3 times.. quietly, while I didn't. I noticed that I nearly fell asleep at its second half; due to the air-conditioner?, or the uninteresting nature of the whole thing?! After its end, I wasn't happy or satisfied. I remember saying: ""What a thin air that was"", thanking God that I didn't have to pay more than 10 pounds for watching it!The story is so old. And this time, the treatment wasn't less trite or careless. There are absolutely no characters. It goes like this, hero: crazy secret agent, heroine: clumsy girl, bad guys, a chase, and THAT'S ABOUT IT. Nothing is detailed or special. The whole movie ranges between learned by heart clichés and pure cartoon. I felt all the time like it was an action comedy with all the talking scenes removed. While it's supposed to be a mix between James Bond and the buddy comedies, it isn't as big as Bond or as comic as any buddy comedy!For me, (Tom Cruise) is no important. (Cameron Diaz) is half important. So when the makers rely on the stars' attraction to carry the movie single-handedly, it must fail for me. Here's a movie where it seems that the writer of it is whether a robot, someone who used to watch good action movies with pressing ""mute"" while anything but the action, or maybe he's a secret agent himself who's sure not allowed to say much. (Knight and Day) makes its viewer as the same as (Diaz)'s character for most of the time: drugged!Then, what it is with the American cinema lately. Not with the mute action movies, but rather with a growing formula? The mix of Bond and the buddy comedy; where there are 2 buddies; one Bond and one clumsy into a chase--became an increasingly recurring pattern with: (Knight and Day), (Killers), (From Paris With Love), (MacGruber); with clumsy Bond, and (Night Date); which was the most creative with 2 clumsy Bonds. Let alone that all of them appeared in just the first 7 month of 2010?! It's not the golden age of that formula, it's the golden age of Hollywood bankruptcy!There is a nice movie there, but barely breathing. I didn't feel related to anything or anyone. Save the action, they forgot to make everything. For instance: the reason why (Cruise) went to meet his enemy's girl wasn't clear? (Cruise) survives every time from deadly predicaments without anyway to explain how; that, if it was being cared of, could have made us really love or respect the guy. Even Bond has some sophisticated gadgets to help him out, but (Cruise) didn't have anything but being (Cruise)! Don't ask how the TV is anytime, anywhere, always on, with only the leads' news; it could've been a running gag, but in another movie! The way (Diaz) re-says all the movie's SHODDY gags at the end was pathetic and unfunny; that needed real complete movie before it to be effective. I knew that (Chris Tucker) and (Adam Sandler) were considered for the lead role; indubitable with people like them, the movie would have been at least funny!I was sad for the good potentials; like dancing music during the fights; now that's frank entertainment, plus the action sequences. Sorrowfully all of that was drowned in 100 min of dry silliness. Even some of the action were tarnished by obvious CGI. What I had was colored shadows running on block of ice. It's all in (Cruise)'s frigid, comedy's feigner, and a bit aged face. With the European backgrounds and the mysterious atmosphere, it reminded me of (Charade - 1963). But forget it entirely, because this is nothing but (Mr. & Mrs. Smith: The Prequel!).To whoever made it: next time, learn well that ""movies aren't trailers"". I write this review as fast as I can, because I know that with (Knight and Day), I'll go through the case of ""Forgotten it all within a week of watching it"". Now I figured out why I slept through it; it's the cold air of it, not the air-conditioner's. Grrrr, even its title is so naive!",Knight and Day
56,DarkVulcan29,"I liked it a little more than Killers, but Knight and Day puts The Bounty Hunter to shame.",10,28 June 2010,"I'm still trying to figure why this movie tanked at box office. I mean when i saw it, what i saw was a fun flick with two leads who have wonderful chemistry. The action was over the top, but thats what it was meant to be, like a Transporter flick that never takes itself too seriously.June(Cameron Diaz) is trying to catch a plane home, to her sisters wedding. She bumps into Roy(Tom Cruise) a handsome polite stranger, who she thinks he is what he appears. When she gets on the plane with Roy, she quickly discovers he is not what he appears to be. When he kills everybody on the plane, mainly they all tried to kill him, now June is drawn into his world of danger, not knowing if she will come out alive.Knight and Day was just an entertaining popcorn flick, it does not try to be anything more. It had a little better action than Killers, but it had a thousand times more laughs than The Bounty Hunter. Cruise and Diaz are great together, I hope they will team up again someday. Also a great supporting role by Paul Dano(There Will Be Blood).",Knight and Day
57,freemantle_uk,A Mediocre Blockbuster,4,11 August 2010,"In theory Knight and Day should have been a winning formula, it has two big name stars in the lead roles and directed by James Mangold, director of Walk the Line and 3:10 to Yuma. It also had a combined formula of action, thriller, romances and comedy. But it sadly failed and it deserves to be Tom Cruise's lowest grossing film for 20 years.June Havens (Cameron Diaz) is a car mechanic who was on her way home to Boston for her sister's wedding when she meets Roy Miller (Cruise) at Wichita airport. Unknown to her Roy is a rogue spy on the run from the FBI and CIA. When Roy kills a place load of spies with June she is forced to join Roy on a international chase, from Boston to New York to Europe, as they are chased by the American government and a Spanish arms dealer, Antonio (Jordi Molla).The reason why Knight and Day fails is because it is mediocre on many fronts. Mangold is a good director but he is known for character based dramas: but with Knight and Day he had very little to work with from the script. The action was average: it was well done but offered nothing new. The CGI was about on the same levels of Jumanji: good for the mid-90s but pedestrian now. It should have been a film that should have used CGI as a last resort and Mangold is good enough to do that. The jokes were not bad but there didn't offer true belly laughs either: the best jokes were in the trailer. The plot itself was simple but not braindead either; but there are holes and there is a lazy device that when things get difficult June is knocked unconscious and then the film skips ahead, so we don't get to see how Roy and June in an action set piece. But Mangold do show some flair, like when he plays typical rom-com music over a scene when Roy is killing a lot of people.The acting is okay throughout, no one is bad but no one stands out either. After an excellent cameo in Tropic Thunder Cruise wanted to do more comedy and he does have comic timing: but he does not have a lot to work with in the script. He is also trying to keep his persona of being a major blockbuster action film, but people can't take him seriously after he started preaching the word of L. Ron Hubbard and going nut on Oprah. It's a shame because Cruise can be a good actor. He needs to do a smaller drama directed by a respected director like Paul Thomas Anderson or Martin Scorsese. Diaz is also decent, offering the audience the occasional laugh and it's clear she has strong chemistry with Mr. Cruise: it was confirmed to anyone who saw them on Top Gear. However it is a stretch to believe Diaz looking as she does and acting clumsy to believe she is a mechanic.A example of weak filmmaking with a limited plot. Inception, Toy Story 3 and even The Karate Kid and The A-Team offer more entertainment value.",Knight and Day
58,dfranzen70,"Cruise, Diaz surprise",7,3 July 2010,"There are two spy movies out this summer involving mismatched couples played by real-life annoying actors. Knight and Day, starring Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz, features the lesser of two evils - faint praise - but turns out to be really a lot of fun, hearkening back to Cruise's action-movie days, and is much more entertaining than you might expect from a movie with two annoying actors in it.Cruise plays Roy Miller, a spy-or-maybe-not who accidentally on purpose ropes June Havens (Diaz) into some espionage. Seems Roy has absconded on a perpetual-energy battery created by some just-out-of-high-school wunderkind, and his former agency partner wants it for bad purposes, as do some really bad Spanish gangsters. June's along for the ride because she got on a plane with Roy that she wasn't supposed to be on.So at first it seems like a lovers-on-the-lam movie, much like the one with Ashton Kutcher and Katherine Heigl, but the big difference here is that it's eminently possible that Roy is, well, deranged, that he's actually the bad guy, who knows. It doesn't matter much. Because here's what's really nifty: Cruise's performance is like a knowing, appreciative nod to his work in the Mission:Impossible movies, only he manages to poke fun at his action-guy persona while still being that action guy.We know that Tom Cruise can act on occasion. He was aces in Born on the Fourth of July and in Minority Report. But too often he phones it in entirely. He smirks and bluffs his way through a movie, trying to coast on fading charm. Now, he does all that here as well, but there's the added is-he-nuts part that gives the movie a real edgy quality to it. And Cruise, bless him, actually pulls it off. He's a fantastic action-guy actor, remember, but up until now he's never really come across as someone who's in on the joke, too. (For all his faults as an actor, Arnold Scwarzenegger at least gives you the impression that he knows he's sort of one dimensional.) Here, Cruise clearly gets it. He's cocky, but not in the mean-spirited, jerky way he was in most of his earlier, virtually indistinguishable films.Then there's Cameron Diaz, who for years was just plain terrible whenever she had to do something other than stand there and look purty. (That duty now falls to Heigl.) With The Box, Diaz showed she had dramatic-acting chops, and here she pulls off the action and comedy to even greater effect than with the Charlie's Angels movies. June isn't a mere victim, but she's believably confused and disoriented by the whirlwind of spy games going on around her. What makes Diaz's efforts so valuable here is that she's never a piece of the scenery; she's sincerely proactive and does a surprisingly good job of making you feel for her without playing on her sexuality to make the sale.James Mangold is the director; he's given us the unevenness of Girl, Interrupted and Copland but also the awesomeness of Walk the Line. Like Walk the Line, he gets the most out of his two stars here, allowing Cruise and Diaz to overachieve monumentally. And Knight and Day is also a huge improvement over the last Cruise/Diaz collaboration, Vanilla Sky, which was a good example of what usually happens when Cruise attempts to act. Here, he returns to his action roots with a lighter, comedic touch, and it really works.",Knight and Day
59,PWNYCNY,Let's say hello to Hollywood's number one comedy team - Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise,8,25 June 2010,"This may be the first major motion picture where the story is completely jettisoned, or made so paper thin as to render it invisible, in order to showcase the comedic talents of the lead actors who, in this case, are quite entertaining. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz may be the Hollywood comedy team of the year. They are wonderful together. Both are funny and are really enjoyable to watch. Tom Cruise has a definite flair for comedy and Ms. Diaz is the modern day Goldie Hawn. Both enliven an otherwise trite script and are proof that good acting can carry a movie. Sometimes when someone's acting career is floundering, a good comic role, properly performed, may be enough to get their career back on track and in this movie Tom Cruise may have found his niche. This movie is a parody, a goof, of some of Hollywood's most iconic action movies and it works because of the presence of Hollywood's number one comedy team, Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise. Now that it is public knowledge that Tom Cruise can do deadpan and Cameron Diaz can act dipsy, the question is: how will Hollywood exploit it. There is little doubt that this movie will spawn at least one sequel. And let's not be surprised if Hollywood decides to do a remake of Private Benjamin with Ms. Diaz as Judy and Tom Cruise winds up starring in the movie version of The Office.",Knight and Day
60,dee.reid,"Pure Hollywood action-romantic comedy, but, boy, is it good!",8,24 January 2011,"""Knight and Day,"" for some reason or another, was a box office disappointment when it was released domestically over the busy 2010 summer movie-going season, yet it somehow fared a lot better when it was released internationally. The movie has two highly bankable stars, a competent director in James Mangold, stellar action sequences, some laugh-out-loud funny moments of comic relief, cheesy romantic lovey-dovey stuff, and a genuine feeling that you didn't just waste 109 minutes of your life.""Knight and Day"" has a cookie-cutter plot that's second-rate when compared to the enthusiastic performances of its two hot leads and slam-bang action sequences and pacing. ""Knight and Day"" was also hot on the heels of a similar-storied action-romantic comedy (""Killers"" starring Ashton Kutcher and Katherine Heigl) and while I know people flocked to see that movie in droves, this film was left out in the cold - shamefully, I might add, because this one is miles ahead of that picture.Part of the reason ""Knight and Day"" succeeds far ahead of ""Killers"" is because of the believable, electrifying chemistry between stars Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. Say what you want about Cruise's off-screen antics (couch-hopping on Oprah, his romance with fellow actress Katie Holmes) and Scientology beliefs, but the man has made an indelible mark on Hollywood and has made cinema history throughout his career with blockbuster hit after blockbuster hit; it's with his off-screen antics that some people claim his box office draw as one of Hollywood's most bankable stars has faded somewhat in the last several years. However, if his career were to end tomorrow, no matter what, he could fade into obscurity knowing that his incredible cinematic catalog cannot be denied by anyone, not even his most skeptic critics.Here, Cruise is Roy Miller, a seemingly everyday bloke with a pearly-white smile who literally bumps into June Havens (Diaz) while the two are waiting in line at a security checkpoint in a Wichita airport. Single girl June is on her way to Boston to be back home in time for her younger sister's wedding. She and Roy strike up a casual conversation in-flight and when June excuses herself to go to the restroom, that's when all hell breaks loose and Roy single-handedly dispatches the plane's crew, passengers, and pilots. As it turns out, Roy is actually a secret agent gone rogue (and I mean, really rogue), or so we're initially led to believe.You see, Roy is apparently on the run from his handlers who believe that he is all of mentally unhinged, unstable, and paranoid. (From his demeanor and actions, we're led to believe they're not kidding, but are his tactics for survival really the actions of an ultra-paranoid rogue super-spy?) He is also in possession of a perpetual-energy battery developed by a young scientific genius named Simon Feck (Paul Dano), who he had whisked away into hiding just a few days earlier. Pretty soon, Roy and June are both on the run from crooked government agents (led by Peter Sarsgaard as Agent Fitzgerald) and the murderous henchmen of a notorious Spanish arms dealer named Antonio (Jordi Molla). So is Roy really crazy, or is he telling the truth? Will he and June survive their time on the lamb? Will they fall in love? Do dogs love bones?""Knight and Day"" begins innocently enough but like Cruise's wild and unpredictable, nearly-invincible super-secret agent Roy Miller character, the movie goes ballistic once the action scenes begin. Cruise is good in a performance that makes great, I mean, excellent use of his good looks, charm, and his ability to carry out his own stunts without the use of a double or overly noticeable wire-work or CGI. And he's able to do all this in the most laid-back manner ever for a man whose life is perpetually in danger of being extinguished by bad guys left & right. Cameron Diaz is also good in one of the few roles in which I've really cared to see her in. She gets a few good comedic moments of her own that aren't too embarrassing for her and prove she does have a funny bone or two in there somewhere; her best scene is probably a moment when Antonio's goons give her a shot of an experimental truth serum and she ends up giving them more information than they asked for. In fact, many of her best moments occur when she is drugged out of her mind and wakes up in some new, exotic locale halfway around the world.Many of the film's action scenes belong squarely to Cruise who as I mentioned earlier, does many of his own stunts, including numerous times when he's jumping off the roofs of buildings or onto the hood of a speeding car. Mangold is skilled in keeping many of these sequences fast & furious (not to mention, bloodless), and undercut with a sly sense of humor that does more than get a few light chuckles but actually gets moments when you're actually laughing out at what's going on.""Knight and Day"" is a movie whose disappointing box office performance last summer really baffles me. It's a movie that should have gotten more attention from the movie-going public and a better reception from critics.""Knight and Day"" - it's your knight in shining armor, so be on the lookout for it, world.8/10",Knight and Day
61,estebangonzalez10,Unstable Knight and Day,5,26 July 2010,"¨They'll tell you I'm mentally unstable and violent and dangerous and it will all sound very convincing. ¨ That is probably the best way to describe Tom Cruise's character in this movie, which is also unstable in trying to be an action thriller, comedy, and romantic flick all at the same time. Knight and Day mostly succeeds as a comedy because of the performance from Cruise and Diaz, but as an action thriller it is pretty ridiculous, and the romance isn't all that believable. The action relies too heavily on poor CGI effects; the story is poorly developed and has too many plot holes. However, Cruise does give a comedic performance and his character is very likable so if you go into this movie expecting a satire of Mission Impossible then you might just enjoy Knight and Day, but don't expect a smart thriller with great action sequences because you will leave the theater disappointed. Mr. and Mrs. Smith began this trend of genre films that combine spy thrillers with comedy and romance, but it has gone downhill from that point. James Mangold has taken a huge step backwards with this movie after directing such great films as the 3:10 To Yuma remake and the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line, and Patrick O'Neill's debut as a screenwriter didn't begin very promising either, but you can't blame him only because the script was rewritten by at least 5 other people, including Mangold himself.I don't want to give too much of the plot away because the most intriguing part of the movie is wondering who Roy Miller (played by Tom Cruise) really is. You wonder if he is a good guy or a bad guy for the first minutes and that is probably one of the best things about Knight and Day. He really gives a good performance and is very funny on screen. He seems a little paranoid, but at the same time he looks relaxed and cool. At the beginning of the film Roy runs into June Havens (Cameron Diaz) in the airport before getting into the plane and uses her without her knowledge to get across customs. June is a mechanic who enjoys restoring classic sport cars and happens to be buying pieces for the vehicle she is assembling to give to her sister as a wedding present. Roy and June share the same flight and seem to click immediately, but everyone else in the plane seems to be trying to kill Roy (including the flight attendants and pilots). Fitzgerald (Peter Sarsgaard from An education) is a CIA agent that is also trying to kill Roy who apparently has something valuable that everyone wants. Even an arms dealer named Antonio (Jordi Molla) is after Roy. June gets involved in all the mess and together with Roy end up all over the States, Jamaica, Austria, and Spain running for their lives. Paul Dano also has a supporting role as a nerdy scientist named Simon Feck that Roy is also trying to protect.The plot is a bit ridiculous and the action is unfulfilling, but there is enough comedy thanks to Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz who are two likable actors who pull off decent performances although they are far from their best work. They've worked together in the past in Vanilla Sky, which is a clear reminder of how much better they can be, but in Knight and Day the issue wasn't their performance, it was the material. Mangold has also proved he can do much better and maybe next time he will stick to more serious material. I'm not saying this movie was terrible or a complete waste of time, but it is far from being a good film. It will satisfy those in need of some good laughs, but this isn't a movie you will want to watch over and over again because the more you think about the plot the more ridiculous you realize it becomes. This is an average film which could be enjoyed if taken lightly and viewed one time only. Cruise fans will definitely enjoy his performance. Not a good movie, but not terrible either.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/",Knight and Day

Tom Cruise does what he does, and as long as he can look thirty-seven instead of fifty, he will continue to do so. I may dislike him, but I cannot deny the charm, and the ability to toss off the one-liners. An amusing device used wherein a character is put to sleep (in various ways) and wakes up God-knows-where. And Cameron Diaz is really coming into her own. She has the timing down pat, and is, in my opinion, even prettier now than she was fifteen years ago.

I'm not entirely sure what the problem was, but for starters it was way over the top (which I think it was meant to be) but it was also all over the place. Diaz is June Havens who inadvertently gets tangled up with a secret agent (Cruise) which sees them dodging bullets and bad guys across the globe.After a while the fact that Diaz kept getting drugged became really annoying as did Cruise constantly saying her name. I also got tired of not knowing if Tom was good or bad or what the hell he was, that aspect just went on too long. No real chemistry between this couple either.

And just let me say that they are both fantastic casting choices! First off, they have great on screen together, they just have a very natural chemistry, it doesn't have to be forced. And even when they're not on screen together, they still carry their scene well. Of course no one should be surprised that Cruise is good in is role, I mean it's Tom freaking Cruise for gods sake. And Cameron Diaz is both comical and very likable and sweet, her performance just seems very natural and like she doesn't even have to try, which is the best kind of acting. Viola Davis is also good in her role, demanding and forceful, a no bulls**t kind of character. The writing is fairly average for this kind of film, and that really isn't a bad thing, I mean if they would've written an academy award worthy script, then great, but being realistic when you look at what kind of movie this is, who in the world would expect that. But it's not bad dialogue at all, it has some of the typical action movie clichés, but it also gives June and Roy some great scenes where they have meaningful conversations and it reveals a good bit about their characters. That's another thing I loved about the film, it had good character development. And of course the high octane action scenes are great fun and entertaining to watch. 8/10.",Knight and Day
67,3xHCCH,Cameron Diaz is the BEST Part of this Film,6,14 July 2010,"""Knight and Day"" is one of those action-comedy star vehicles with rather familiar storyline and generic villains. This mismatched spy guy meets funny girl was just tackled earlier this year in the Ashton Kutcher-Katherine Heigl film called ""Killers."" Of course, ""Knight and Day"" had the bigger stars and most probably a bigger budget.Tom Cruise plays Roy Miller, an ace but rogue government agent of questionable character. I felt he was the deciding factor whether you will like the film or not. It is either you like his performance or not. Sorry, I did not like it. He has all the familiar cocky acting tics we have seen him do in all his previous films. I personally felt he was too old for this film for some reason. Even his scene coming out of the sea with only his swimming trunks on (reminiscent of Daniel Craig in ""Casino Royale"") did not really show a flattering view of his aging body.Cameron Diaz plays June Havens, a ditzy blonde on her way to her sister's wedding, whom Roy befriends in order to sneak a top-secret perpetual energy source into the plane. I thought she was fantastic here! She was the best part of this film, and the reason why I think it is above the mean. She is sunny, sexy and very funny. She doesn't play it too seriously. I felt her bubbly character really saved this from being just another retread of Tom's ""Mission Impossible"" films. And on top of that, she looked great in that red two-piece string bikini.For me the first two thirds of the film was merely OK, and I could not help feeling that I had seen all that incredibly preposterous action sequences before. I felt the best action scene of the film was during the last third when they drove a sports car right into the running of the bulls in Spain! That was a highly original and very exciting car chase sequence I had never seen before.Overall, this film is not that bad, really. You just lower your expectations and you may like it. If you like Tom Cruise's portrayal of Roy Miller, then you will probably enjoy it more. Unfortunately, that is not the case for me.",Knight and Day

70,AudioFileZ,Surprisingly Entertaining...Good Summer Popcorn Flick!,7,21 November 2010,"Want to see a fantastical action flick that works as entertainment...Don't see The Expendables, see Knight And Day instead. Where the dark and ridiculous Sylvester Stallone summer action movie fails ""Knight And Day"" keeps it light, action-packed, and immensely entertaining.I always have to get past Tom Cruise, well, just being Tom Cruise. I was able to do it with the WWII historical drama Valkyrie and now, I'm happy to report, I have been able to do likewise with ""Knight And Day"" which is a slightly different take on the old secret agent action/comedy. This unbelievable stuff demands to be delivered lightly with a ""nod-and-a-wink"", that's exactly how Tom Cruise presents himself here to wonderful comedic effect. We know he can do over-the-top action as his Mission Impossible franchise has demonstrated, and with this laid-back performance the viewer is entertained so well as to forget the utter ridiculous nature of his survival as well as, perhaps, the even more ""out-there"" protection of Cameron Diaz's character. Who knew Tom Cruise was this good at light comedy? Bottom line: mere mortals would die within seconds yet these two escape whatever level of violence they are subjected to in creative and fun ways. Where I as a viewer was fed up with ""The Expendables"" because it was too much silliness while it plays itself as serious, ""Knight And Day"" never falls into that trap and is really fun.I believe the whole movie rests on this lightness of the script that delivers constant well conceived action segments and the totally in-sync performances of Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. Before seeing the movie I was thinking I wished the female role was anybody but Ms. Diaz, but after viewing I think her casting fit, she really contributes by nailing the tough, yet hysterical, female. If you get the feeling I was surprised overall with my pleasure you are correct. ""Knight And Day"" is a well executed summer ""popcorn"" action flick. The performances and the beautiful location cinematography augment a wild tale which is a fun ride indeed.",Knight and Day
71,Samiam3,A misfire ... plain and simple,5,14 December 2010,"Knight and Day is the kind of movie that works best when talent triumphs over studio...that doesn't happen here. To start with the obvious, Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz get wasted on account of a script which can't do much better than a few good one liners. The movie thinks because it is a comedy that it can get away with the employment of coincidence and contrivance to drive the plot, and the attempt to blur the line between action and comedy results in something that is way too ridiculous to enjoy. It's the kind of movie that you laugh at rather than laugh from.I wont argue that it's terrible. Knight and Day is at best watchable. The earlier parts are the better ones. Some of the banter between Diaz and Cruise is mildly cute and Diaz does a pretty comedic scream. Too bad she can't deliver her lines as well. The action stunts are sometimes clever ideas. I like it when Hollywood satirizes itself by mocking the kinds of moments that you see in...(let's say) Wanted, where one can make a bullet curve. Knight and Day has the potential to be such a satire, but instead of favoring comedy over action, it tries to mix both. The result feels bloated, and dumb, and is degraded further by the use of dreadful green screening and CGI.As is the case with so many blockbusters, Knight and Day does not have a very high opinion of its audience. Seeing the faces of two of Hollywood's hottest stars is a good enough substitute for introduction or explanation, right? ...wrong. We don't ever really get to know who we are rooting for which is kind of hard to accept, along with the whole scenario. Everything that happens in Knight and Day is something that we've seen before. I won't give examples just in case anyone reading this does plan to see the movie, but I can recommend better. Try the Other Guys, or the Losers.",Knight and Day

73,p-stepien,"Entertaining, if bland",5,6 January 2011,"June Havens (Cameron Diaz), your typical ravishingly hot 'wish-you-were-a-son' car mechanic with a love for scrap metal, is going to get prepped for her sister's wedding. While bound for a flight she bumps into Roy Miller (Tom Cruise). Twice. Literally. After some flight troubles and delays June ends up on the same plane with the suave charming stranger, where she quickly falls for his rasp lines and heartwarming demeanour. That is until Roy kills everyone on board, crashes the plane and than drugs June. The next day she wakes up in her own bed safe and secure... but the crazy fun is just about to begin...Actually an endearing little action comedy, which took me slightly by surprise. Yes, the plot is idiotic and some of the scenes don't really make sense and seem forcibly put in so we have a more or less successful joke with a crisp punchline. Yes, the morality of the whole film is flimsy at best with the people killed in the initial flight basically inexcusable. Yes, everyone in the movie is made out of cardboard and border on being fillers for the main two heroes.But all in all I did enjoy watching the movie - however forgettable it was. Despite not being a fan of either Cruise or Diaz I must admit they both stole their roles. Tom Cruise does a fine job as a wacky ueberspy with a touch of romance to him, whilst Cameron Diaz always nails it when it comes to playing screaming panicking slightly imbecilic blonds.All in all definitely the epitome of a popcorn movie and although it may not be as satisfying in that regard as ""Mr and Mrs Smith"" I can mildly recommend the experience.",Knight and Day
74,ArtVandelayImporterExporter,Dog And Sh*t,2,7 April 2017,"In a world over-flowing with stories and the talent to bring them to life, why does Hollywood keep cranking out such unmitigated piles of cr@p? The crazy Scientologist does what he does best - shows his teeth. Diaz can't act to save her life, either, but unlike Cruise she's not pretty to look at so I have no idea how she keeps getting cast in movies. There is no wit, no tension, no plot. Just posing. Producers should have taken some of the salaries paid to Cruise and Diaz and hired a competent writer or two, because this story is a mess. In fact, it plays as though they were just filming random scenes that got spliced together in the editing room. Seriously, if you were to take the movie, chop it up scene by scene and put each scene in its own container, jumbled all the canisters on a giant drum, and then reassembled the scenes in random order, this movie would make as much sense. If I'd paid $10+ to watch this at the local Googleplex rather than catching it for free on AMC, I would take a leave of absence from work and spend the next year boycotting that theatre. I give the Scientologist's teeth 2 stars. Everything else gets zero.",Knight and Day
75,justin-fencsak,Good movie for grown-ups to see,10,27 June 2010,"It's been nearly 10 years since Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise were in a major movie (that would be Vanilla Sky), so times have changed personally and economically for these two once-great stars. Now comes Knight and Day, a nearly 2-hour thrill and laugh ride that will have a good lengthy run at your multiplex due to smart acting, witty humor, and some cool stunts and action scenes (Tom Cruise did all of his stunts with his co-star). The locations are pretty cool as the two travel from coast to coast and ocean to ocean. The soundtrack is pretty good, with classic pop music. The script is original and the cinematography and sound mix are amazing. Go see it.",Knight and Day
76,Matt_Layden,A Fun Time With Diaz & Cruise.,7,30 November 2010,"June (Diaz) is on her way home for her sisters wedding, when she meets a good looking guy, Roy (Cruise) that is on her flight. Little does she know, he is actually a spy and a trained killer. He has a battery that is wanted by the same organization that he use to work for. Now they both find out that the only people they can trust is each other.Killers starring Ashton Kutcher and Katherine Heigl is almost the same idea here as Knight & Day. Blonde woman who is enjoying her everyday life runs into a handsome guy, guy turns out to be a trained killer, yet she tags along with him anyways. The difference is that Knight & Day has a better cast, script, comedy, action and is more fun. The film has its fair share of problems, but the overall product is a fun entertaining thriller with two leads who play well off each other. Cruise is back and this time he brought he comedic chops with him. Cruise was the funniest thing about Tropic Thunder and he might have a new genre to star in. He takes the role with charm, danger and fun. His co-star, Diaz, whom shared the screen with Cruise in Vanilla Sky, plays the role of the audience member. She is thrown into this world, knows nothing and is basically along for the ride. James Mangold, who has some good films under his belt, directs the film well enough so the viewer can actually see the action sequences. There are a few instances where the obvious green screen was a bit of a distraction, but other than that, the action set pieces were entertaining enough. We start with a fight sequence on a plane, which is then landed in a corn field, then a car chase, some more fight scenes, followed by more chases, both on foot and a motorcycle. The film goes globe-trotting and it's nice to see the Europe country side.The film does suffer from some weak writing for the so called bad guys. Throughout the film we are told two things. One, that the guy after Cruise is trying to sell the battery is framed him and two, that Cruise himself has gone rogue and stole it. It's obvious how the film will eventually unfold and this leads to some weak antagonists for the film. The banter between Cruise and Diaz is fun and there are some funny sequences when Diaz is drugged and so many impossible and crazy things are going on around her, but we the audience only get a glimpse of it through her dazed and confused eyes. It's a funny sequence that starts with them getting captured and ends with them on a beach in swim gear.Knight & Day is a fun way to spend 109 minutes and it's also nice to see Cruise back in films where he is having some fun.",Knight and Day
77,lewiskendell,Wasted cast equals lukewarm flick.,5,16 January 2011,"I really wanted to like Knight & Day a lot. Even now, I'm struggling to make this review as positive as possible and talk about the things I found appealing. Um, it was good to see Tom Cruise back in an action role. He has a natural flair for those. And the locations in Germany, Spain, and other places were gorgeous. I'd love to visit. Er, it's also a very sunny movie, which gives the cinematography a bright, pretty quality. And, well, Diaz's hair looked nice.It's just impossible to ignore the fact that Knight & Day is a generic action/comedy that doesn't stand out in any way, despite the considerable star power of the cast. There's absolutely zero chemistry between Cruise and Diaz, which makes the romantic angle fail right out of the gate. Paul Dano, Peter Sarsgaard, Viola Davis, and Maggie Grace are all wasted in parts that are inconsequential or two-dimensional. The action scenes fail to wow or captivate, the story speeds in a straight line to its convenient and predictable ending, and the attempts at comedy rarely warrant as much as a chuckle. Knight & Day isn't a terrible movie, it's just so safe and formulaic that it managed to not even be as interesting as a bad movie might have been. Let's face it, a movie like a train wreck can be mesmerizing, sometimes. Knight & Day is more like an old lady driving in front of you at 40 miles per hour, while you desperately hope that she takes one of the upcoming turns and gets out of your way.",Knight and Day
78,moviewizguy,Not as dumb and mindless as the previews make it out to be.,8,27 June 2010,"A chance encounter thrusts a woman and a charming but lethal operative into a series of adventures across the globe. As if dodging assassins and uncovering world-changing secrets weren't enough, she must now figure out if he is a good guy, a traitor – or just plain crazy. (20th Century Fox)K&D surprised me in a way that it isn't as mindless and dumb as the previews make it out to be. In fact, it reminded me of the spy movies in the 80s and 90s. There's actually a thoroughly engaging plot line and well developed characters we can root for. Because of this, K&D is one of the better popcorn films this summer. But let's not rule out the action because there are some absurd action sequences in here, although they looked very realistic compared to the action in THE A-TEAM I've experienced a couple of days ago.K&D doesn't dive right into the action like most action films do these days. It takes its time establishing the characters and the situations they are in, and I appreciated that. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz reunite once again after their last film together, VANILLA SKY, and it's their chemistry together that makes the film work so well. Tom Cruise looks like he's having the time of his life playing such a crazy character, although some would joke that he acts like that in real life. I enjoyed his character a lot and there's this unique charisma that only Tom Cruise himself can pull off. What can I say? I'm easily charmed by him. I also enjoyed Cameron Diaz very much in her very funny role as the person who can't believe she's in the situation she is in. Peter Sarsgaard, on the other hand, isn't really all that noteworthy. However, it's always great to see Viola Davis in any role she's in.But when the film finally goes for the action scenes, they aren't really over-the-top, with an exception of one or two--okay, maybe three sequences. The film keeps us grounded to reality in a way that it doesn't defy gravity and physics. I must say, though, as ridiculous as the car chase sequences may be, they are really impressive to watch. I haven't seen this good of car stunts since I rewatched Quentin Tarantino's DEATH PROOF a couple of months ago. There's also quite a bit of comedy as well. The comedic timing between Cruise and Diaz is fantastic. The film blends the action, comedy, and romance as if it was a piece of cake.And let's not forget the locations. The film jumps from many different countries that I thought were stunning to look at. All I could think was, ""Wow. I really need to get out there."" The pacing is also great because I've never once found myself bored or uninterested. John Powell's score is, in a way, copied and pasted from his score for MR. AND MRS. SMITH which disappointed me after his magnificent score from HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON.Overall, K&D certainly isn't your usual mindless and dumb popcorn flick of the summer. It's a thoroughly entertaining film with some great action sequences, a fantastic chemistry between Cruise and Diaz, and an interesting story with some thought put into it. It has action, romance, and comedy. Need I say more?",Knight and Day
79,bob-rutzel-1,Excellent. Pure Entertainment,10,1 December 2010,"Roy Miller (Cruise) is a former FBI agent who is protecting the inventor of a battery that will help solve the world's energy problems. The FBI believes he has gone rogue. June (Diaz) is caught in the middle and is not sure who or what to believe. I have never enjoyed a movie more than this one. I like it when a main character, in this case, Roy, is always 3-steps ahead of those chasing him. We see great action stunts and I mean really terrific stunts, fantastic CGI, good lines and some comedy as well. What more could an audience want? This is pure entertainment. Realism: take a back seat for a while, this is too much fun. As for Cameron Diaz, she really got her groove on in this movie. No, she is nothing like a Laura Croft type, but she really got into this story. I think because of some of the stunts she was also involved in she had to pay closer attention to detail, and you could see some concern on her face at times. Real concern. In other movies, I just thought of her as eye candy and an average actress, but she has shown that she can focus when she needs to. She displayed a gamut of emotions in here. Very good. Oh, she is still eye candy, but now I can consider her more than that. Okay, this is not Shakespeare, but does it have to be? There was one thing I didn't understand. When June goes to board the plane she is told she cannot as the flight is overbooked. A few minutes later an attendant says they found a seat for her. When she boards the plane she sees there are only a handful of people on board. She doesn't find that out of the ordinary and says something lame. There is no explanation. Why was she told the flight was overbooked when apparently it was not? See?The title Knight and Day makes you think the main characters' names are Knight and Day. Originally, I thought so. Wrong. The Knight part is easy, (and it's not the knight figurine – thrown in to throw you off -- Roy bought at the airport; I think he bought it, but I didn't see him pay for it. Pretty sure he bought it), but not the Day part unless you go along with some of the last lines in the movie. I don't, but there are no other clues. Not a deal breaker. Just something to ponder on. However, you have to go pretty far into the movie to discover what the significance of Knight is. Pretty sure he paid for it. Almost sure. FBI agent Fitzgerald (Sarsgaard) looks a lot like Kiefer Sutherland, don't you think? Maybe a little Gig Young too. He did a good job as did everyone else, and I think Cruise and Diaz worked well together. The photographer could have lingered a little longer on some of the scenery we were shown, but very good. As for Tom Cruise, hey, he's your next Clark Kent aka Superman. And, his wife Katie can be Lois. Think about it. But, he as Superman cannot shoot anyone. Will that be a problem? All in all a very enjoyable movie, sheer fantasy, pure entertainment. Hey, do you think Roy and June will meet Mr. and Mrs. Smith?Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: One F-bomb by Ms Diaz. Ouch!",Knight and Day
80,moviexclusive,Moviexclusive - Knight and Day,6,24 June 2010,"And here we have our next serving of 2010's summer blockbuster platter.Truth be told, we weren't very impressed with the title of this James Mangold (3:10 to Yuma, Walk the Line) directed movie. What's up with the unoriginal word pun? The poster showcasing two silhouettes of superstars Tom Cruise (Valkyrie, Tropic Thunder) and Cameron Diaz (The Box, My Sister's Keeper)? Frankly, we've seen better. The 110 minute thriller contains lots of action. Oh, it's a comedy too. But since it's the summer blockbuster season, and audiences are not required to be intellectual (in all senses of the word), we guess these marketing efforts were necessary. But what's with the unexciting theatrical trailer which gives away, well, almost everything for the movie? The ""been there done that"" feeling didn't bode well for the popcorn flick, especially with disposable movies like Andy Tennant's The Bounty Hunter and Robert Luketic's The Killers before this.The script has the girl getting entangled a strange guy who is a secret agent. He has some kind of dark secrets that invite all kind of trouble, involving lots of guns, arms and explosives. As the unlikely duo tries to stay alive by traveling to different countries around the world, they realise they need each other to survive this adventure. Not very creative, we'd say.It was with this perception that we stepped into the preview theatre, expecting a two hour yawn fest.Fortunately for everyone involved in the production, it turned out to be more enjoyable than expected. One huge contributing factor is the main stars' charm. Cruise and Diaz were mega stars (to some, they are still mega stars), and this movie clearly shows why old school star power still works. Things were going really well for the good looking Cruise until his recent sofa hopping antics on Oprah Winfrey's talk show. But in this movie, he effortlessly exudes the leading man appeal, running from continent to continent, looking extremely suave and dashing. He shows off his chiseled body every now and then by appearing topless. Girls, get ready to swoon. And Diaz complements this charisma with her ditzy persona. She may not be your typical damsel in distress, but the holds her own ground with that cuteness we last saw in McG's Charlie Angels movies. The blue eyed blonde will leave an impression with viewers with her likable performance in this movie. This results in a fun chemistry that has the two characters bantering with each other throughout the movie's runtime.Cruise is 48, and stands at 1.70 metres. Diaz is 38, and stands at 1.75 metres. But this is showbiz after all, so you won't be noticing the age and ahem, the height difference as the pair wheezes through different picturesque locations in the movie.So we have two personalities anchoring this movie. They are supported by capable actors like Peter Sarsgaard (An Education, Orphan), Viola Davis (Law Abiding Citizen, Doubt) and Paul Dano (Taking Woodstock, There Will Be Blood). One can't help but feel that these acclaimed actors are underused in this loud and noisy flick. Expect car chases, explosions, plane crashes, gun fights, hand combats and all other obligatory mind numbing elements that make up a summer blockbuster.Which also means, you shouldn't be too concerned about the formulaic plot. It brings you through the predictable story developments, through a series of mildly funny dialogues. The character caricatures are also nothing to shout about. But we are guessing this isn't of utmost importance to the filmmakers, who just want to make a breezy action comedy thriller to please the masses.But we are not complaining, because we have seen worse from other run of the mill movies that put us to sleep. At least the filmmakers managed to keep adrenaline rush going throughout this enjoyable flick, so that you'd wish you were there globe trotting with the good looking stars.",Knight and Day
81,Luigi Di Pilla,Very amusing action comedy thriller,7,19 December 2010,I found this movie much more better than Mr. and Mrs. Smith starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.I was very impressed by the high pace in this action comedy. I mean it happened every time something and it was never boring. I was also surprised about the many strong action parts. The executed stunts by Tom Cruise were really great. I think that all the crew must have benefited from the knowledge of Tom Cruise experienced in his Mission Impossible series. The dialogs were funny and some slapstick scenes reminded me the James Bond films. James Mangold directed very well. The places and the sceneries were well chosen and the pictures were superb too. I spent an entertaining Saturday evening and I had great fun. I rate it 7 but my wife 4 out of ten.,Knight and Day
82,stensson,Knight and night,4,20 July 2010,"Tom Cruise can't act anymore. He always knew how to smile and he still knows that, but he can't live on that ability. Not even in a film like this.This is a so called action-comedy. Since long, all discussions about censoring film violence is strictly forbidden, but if you still honour the rebel banner, you can of course say that killing about a 100 people with hardly any blood seen at all, can make some real damage to the audiences morals. Violence is neither fun nor clean.Cameron Diaz is making one of her better performances here and she's the only one who tries to act like a comedian. But the only must about this film is that you really mustn't see it. Too little good action, too little good comedy.",Knight and Day
83,saadgkhan,Its not as bad as critics says.. Confusing and unrealistic yet quite entertaining,7,19 September 2010,"KNIGHT AND DAY – CATCH IT ( B+ ) Knight and Day, well I've been waiting for this movie ever since it's in the making and when it came out, I heard the negative reviews. I was surprised as it has the biggest stars of Hollywood it can't be that bad. After watching the movie now I know why critics are so negative about it because the script or story line of the movie is really childish. You don't expect such plot line from Tom Cruise or Cameron Diaz. Still it doesn't mean it doesn't work, it actually work perfectly because once you get the story it's easy to buy the movie further. Knight and Day starts off really confusing and unrealistic plus the plane crash and then car chase sequences seems over the top. (Though they were brilliantly shot). Later on there are nonstop action sequences and the end action sequence within the Bull race in Spain is just simply Jaw Dropping. Tom Cruise is charismatic and Cameron Diaz is cheerful and their chemistry is the total base of the movie. Maggie Grace, Marc Blucas, Paul Dano, Viola Davis were wasted and Peter Sarsgaard is OK as always. (I always found him incredibly boring actor) They make it work big time plus the heavy larger than life action sequences makes it really treat to watch. I think if they worked a little more on the story it could have been a brilliant entertainer like Mr. and Mrs. Smith but still nonetheless it is quite entertaining. Watch it you won't disappoint and Tom Cruise haters should take rest now, leave him Alone!",Knight and Day
84,Troy_Campbell,Watchable thanks to Cruise and Diaz.,5,16 July 2010,"It's been a while since a movie has so heavily relied on the charismatic pairing of its lead couple to rake in the crowds. Chances are you won't see this because the action in the trailer hooked you in, but rather because you're interested to see if these two waning Hollywood heavyweights can still produce the magic they clearly had in their heyday. Well, I've got some good news and some bad news.The good news is that this potentially dynamic duo actually have a splendid chemistry. Their effortless banter is natural and humorous, as if they've been sharing the screen together for years. Cruise is especially electric as he confidently offers a tongue-in-cheek performance that isn't afraid to mock his larger-than-thou action star persona. Where I expected him to turn one way, he unflinchingly opts for path number two and takes his unhinged spy to a place I didn't previously consider. Diaz isn't quite as thrilling in her role – June is a much more stock-standard routine – however she provides the ideal counterpart for The Cruiser and indeed bounces off him with ease. She looks a whole lot better in swimwear too.Now for the bad news: everything surrounding Cruise and Diaz is dreadful. And I mean everything. For starters, the plot has more holes in it than Sonny's car in The Godfather. Not just small gaps that are accepted as necessary to facilitate the addition of a really cool scene, but rather large and mindless cracks that are formed because of lazy screen writing. Then there is the strangely uninspired and bland turn by the otherwise terrific Sarsgaard. The An Education actor doesn't appear to want to be there, mumbling and fumbling his dialogue with a woodenness I wouldn't have thought in his repertoire.Worst of all though is the surprisingly shonky special effects that accompany the already average action. With an estimated budget of over $100m, is it too much to hope for realistic computer and practical effects? It's not even a CGI-dominated film where the flaws can be spotted without difficulty, it's basic age-old techniques like background matting that fail miserably here. Every time we're watching people in a vehicle – which is a lot – it's plain as day that they're on a sound stage somewhere in L.A. sitting in front of a green screen. I can't even start to explain how dire the effects were for the bull-running set piece which featured our protagonists on a motor bike.Watchable thanks to Cruise and Diaz, but they deserved a much better platform to prove they still have what it takes in Tinseltown.2.5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",Knight and Day
85,pyrocitor,"Echoes of quality, ripples of youth",6,20 July 2010,"Knight and Day is a film rife with paradoxes, which, ironically, belies the utter lack of complexity the film displays. It is both a film behind its times and yet of its times, fuelled with the devil-may-care cheerful irreverence and willing outrageousness of the sort of action movies usually found in the 1990s (complete with stars who, at that point, were enjoying their heydays) yet also with a looming somber media sensibility indicative of post 9/11 times. It is a film which attempts to simultaneously subversively mock the action genre which also delivering bombastic, full out action, as such only succeeding to a limited degree at either goal. It is a film reeking of confused tone, yet with a clear vision: to have as much fun as possible. And, for the duration of its sticking to this vision, Knight and Day is as entertaining as they come. Unfortunately, such heights prove distinctly fleeting. The film unquestionably delivers a promising first act, allowing Cruise and Diaz to fire on full comedic cylinders while propelling them through an incessant slew of dazzlingly over the top car chases and shootouts while exchanging snappy banter and sexual tension like pros. Nonetheless, it is only a matter of time before the fun sputters, getting too caught up in its own spy thriller trappings to reminder to supply a nod and a wink and causing the general tone to shift to more stone faced, even as the ludicrous plot setting in (a MacGuffin about a perpetually charged battery) demands all the more urgently for irreverent comic relief. Equally, there is something unmistakably uncomfortable about the chemistry between Cruise and Diaz: both looking their age but attempting to play fifteen years younger, there remains a leery feel of faked youth which only serves to detract from the festivities. By the time the film tumbles along to its clumsy ending, fuelled by a particularly wince-worthy patch of deus-ex-machina and boorish repetition, any grins which might have crossed the audiences faces at first are more than liable to be replaced by frowns of irritation or indifference. That said, for at least the first half of the film, Tom Cruise ably demonstrates that his legendary steely charisma remains undiminished, coupling it with a recently rekindled sense of deadpan lunacy to make his super secret agent Roy Miller far more enjoyable than any such stereotype has a right to be. Cameron Diaz, despite raising the occasional (admittedly raucous) laugh, is not treated with as much generosity by the film's script. For the most part, Diaz (whose character literally has no impact or purpose within the film apart from exchanging sensual banter with Cruise) is stuck screaming or whining, making her enough of an irritation that by the time the film boorishly attempts to turn expectations on their head by making her the capable one saving Cruise's life, her character has become so outright dismissible that one cannot even celebrate her much needed empowerment. Peter Sarsgaard appears bewildered as to how he ended up on the set, delivering a performance so utterly bland and unoriginal as a fed chasing Miller that the absence of more than a shred of his usual talent feels almost insulting. Equally, Paul Dano comes on strong with a hilarious introductory scene as a somewhat unhinged boy genius, but is quickly shuffled off into a supplier of concerned exposition, much to everyone's inevitable disappointment. Car chases! Explosions! Gunfights! Sexual tension! Big stars! If the mere mention of such blanket head promises manages to evoke heart palpitations of excitement, at least the first half of Knight and Day is liable to deliver in spades. Nonetheless, those expecting any semblance of originality or more than a nostalgic echo for the glory days of Cruise and Diaz should hardly consider the project worth seeing the light of day. -6/10",Knight and Day

I am a Cruise fan, I loved Collateral, admired Jerry Maguire and weep during Rainman...But I honestly thought this film would blow.Cruise plays a character who is lovable with his charming smile and words of wisdom, and yet mysterious to the point were we question his loyalty. He delivers some wonderful lines with great enthusiasm...I found myself bursting into laughter during the ""I'm the guy!"" scene....Just hilarious and also what follows after.

So they marketed it as a comedy, and now we as the audience can laugh with them instead of at them.If we weren't told that we should be laughing at all the common action turns and contrivances, then this is exactly the same as every other action flick hitting the theatres.Full of high speed car chases, machine gun shooting, plane crashes, helicopters, trains and everything else that moves at top velocity, and of course the model-like heroine, the hero with movie star good looks and chiseled abs, the genius scientist, and more bad guys that might be good guys than you could even count.

It's a failed attempt at a spy satire that way tries too hard to be funny and resorts to back to back mindless action sequences in an attempt to be entertaining.The mix of humour and action might have worked if it didn't feel so forced and artificial.

90,hall895,Harmless fun,6,30 June 2013,"Knight and Day is never going to be considered any kind of cinematic masterpiece. It's not a great movie. But it is pretty fun. It's entertaining enough that you're willing to forgive its missteps. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz make for a good pairing. Diaz shows that she's up for pretty much anything as her character goes on a wild ride. Meanwhile Cruise gets to show off the charm and personality that made him a movie star in the first place. And there are plenty of action sequences too for Cruise to show he can still kick butt when required. The film breezes along. It's well-paced, never really dragging. You could quibble and say the film's second half doesn't quite measure up to the first. But there is still enough going on to keep you entertained all the way to the end.Diaz plays June Havens, an ordinary woman who innocently bumps into Roy Miller at the airport. Roy, played by Cruise, is not an ordinary man and it turns out his bumping into June wasn't so innocent after all. Roy is a secret agent and he and June are about to have a very eventful flight. What happens on the plane sets the tone for the rest of the film. It's silly, it's way over the top. But it's fun. And we go on from there. More silly, over the top, fun action sequences come in quick succession. Roy and June set off on a wild globetrotting adventure. And Cruise and Diaz sell it very well. The interplay between their two characters gives the film a lighter touch it needs considering the rather absurdly high body count. Along the way they pick up a young genius inventor, played by Paul Dano, who holds the key to the film's big secret. What is that big secret? Who cares? It's just something to move the movie along. This is not a movie about story, it's a movie about two big movie stars doing what they do best, entertaining you. Dano does fine with his role, Peter Sarsgaard has some moments as an antagonist. But the movie is all about Cruise and Diaz and they deliver. If you think about the story too much you'll probably realize how silly the whole thing is. So don't think about it. Embrace the silliness, appreciate what Cruise and Diaz give you. There's a lot of extravagant nonsense going on around them but they keep the movie grounded well enough. You buy into the evolving relationship their characters have. You root for them and you enjoy their adventure. Ultimately you enjoy the movie. It starts out with a bang and while it wobbles a bit in the middle it has enough momentum to carry itself to the end. Cruise and Diaz have great personality and charisma. And if you're a fan of big action who just likes to see a lot of things blown up the movie has you covered there too. Not a great movie. But a fun one.",Knight and Day
91,thekarmicnomad,Same old but with a quirky twist. Don't be too hard on it.,7,29 January 2012,"Tom Cruise is some kind of super agent/assassin type guy who jumps, rolls and shoots his way through the film closely followed by Cameron. Both are playing characters they have played a million times before, so the characters are instantly recognisable and well portrayed. Which is great as long as you aren't expecting anything new or original.What is a nice touch is Tom's character has moments where he is a cross between the Terminator and an Inspirational Public Speaker. He reels off encouraging nuggets of wisdom before jumping off a skyscraper to coldly gun down the bad guys. This was actually quite funny and Cameron plays off it fabulously.Apart from that, expect car chases, explosions, automatic weapons etc. etc. etc.Very enjoyable as long as you don't expect to be surprised.",Knight and Day
92,vitaleralphlouis,Definitely NOT for adults.,5,8 July 2010,"20th Century Fox falsely advertised KNIGHT AND DAY as the best summer movie for Adults. Not so, McGee; this one was made for 12 year old's --- just like 90% of the boring junk from today's Hollywood.The good points are Tom Cruise and Penelope Cruz and their interplay. There are maybe 4 or 5 good laughs. And the on-location scenery, particularly in Europe, is nice to look at.As for the story, there are multiple car chases, explosions, 50 to 100 dead bodies (mostly mowed down by machine gun fire), all the usual same-old same-old from the cocaine soaked nitwits that write ""screenplays"" but ought to enter re-hab instead.It was interesting to watch the Liberal Media having one virtual orgasm over the ""disappointing"" box office results -- beginning with the film's first hour in theaters; supposedly marking the dead end of Tom Cruise and his career. I have no clue why the Tweedledum Tweedledee media hate Tom Cruise. I don't like Scientology but could not care less if Cruise does. As for jumping up and down on a sofa on TV, this is what celebrities do. There are worse things, like molesting children, but the media folks love Michael Jackson and hate Tom Cruise. Go figure these jerks.",Knight and Day
93,dglink,Fluffy Action Comedy with Appealing Cast,7,18 December 2014,"Although far inferior in both concept and results, ""Knight and Day"" has its roots in the classic screwball comedies of the 1930's. Cute, seemingly coincidental airport encounters connect an attractive blonde, Cameron Diaz, who is en route to her sister's wedding, with a handsome man of mystery, Tom Cruise, and a series of wildly improbable events ensues. An early scene aboard a near-empty airliner is perhaps the film's highlight, as Cruise does battle with unknown assailants, while a blissfully unaware Diaz primps in the restroom, intent on seducing Cruise. Perhaps if the humor and pace of this scene had been sustained, the film would have been more successful. If Cary Grant were the dashing stranger and Katharine Hepburn the unwitting accomplice, the film would have been classic.However, while they are attractive leads, Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz are not Grant and Hepburn. Although the pair have undeniable star power and seem to be having fun, their eyes were likely focused more on the paycheck than on the superficial script which lacks the witty exchanges of classic screwball comedy. Also appearing for the money is a talented supporting cast that includes Viola Davis, Peter Sarsgaard, and Paul Dano; unfortunately, none of these gifted performers have roles that stretch their acting skills. With chases, gunfights, and rapid cutting, director James Mangold keeps the film moving at breakneck speed as the cast chases a ""McGuffin"" in the form of a super battery, whose importance is often lost in the sometimes confusing proceedings.Although even the classic screwball comedies stretched credibility, Mangold's film uses CGI to create sequences that are beyond preposterous. At times, Cruise seems to be a super-hero with supernatural powers; his close encounters are unbelievable even for a Batman or Fantastic Four. As the complicated plot unfolds, the characters' motivations seem to shift, and the audience is kept guessing as to who can and cannot be trusted and who is working for whom. The action, light comedy, and appealing performers will hold viewer interest throughout, although, like cotton candy, this fluffy piece will fade from memory before the closing credits finish rolling.",Knight and Day

95,Bob-45,"Entertaining fluff, but stars deserve better",7,7 January 2011,"""Knight and Day"" is a fun action comedy, with plenty of unbelievable stunts and sharp one-liners. However, I can't imagine this movie working with anyone other than Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. Tom and Cameron have such terrific chemistry that it's a pity neither of their two films (the other, ""Vanilla Sky"") has really showcased the seriocomic romantic potential. To its credit, ""Knight and Day"" doesn't dwell on the action scenes. Unlike some other reviewers, I liked the running gag of either Cruise or Cameron sleeping through the action-filled escapes, as I felt this reinforced the skimpy time devoted to the romance. ""Knight and Day"" reminds me of the much-better ""Charade""; had the action requisites been toned down a bit more, devoting more time for the romance, it could have been just as good. I truly hope to eventually see Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz in a more intimate romantic comedy, as they are as inspired a pairing as Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore.On it own merits, in addition to the charming leads and great stunts, ""Knight and Day"" boasts excellent sound and cinematography and good music. James Mangold's direction is good, but not outstanding, though it is certainly better than Cameron Crowe's in ""Vanilla Sky"".I give ""Knight and Day"" a strong ""7"".",Knight and Day
96,jon.h.ochiai,Fun Summer Ride,9,27 June 2010,"In ""Knight and Day"" while off the global communication grid on a remote island, Cameron Diaz as June asks Tom Cruise's mysterious Roy why he didn't warn her about getting on the plane, which lead to their current debacle. Roy says he did. June stresses next time he could say, ""You are going to f***ing die!"" Cruise and Diaz's whacky and disarming chemistry distinguishes Director James Mangold's ""Knight and Day"". Tom Cruise is amazingly fit and at his intense, funny best. Cameron Diaz is beautiful, goofy charming—she never takes herself seriously. No doubt ""Knight and Day"" has been done before, and consequently has polarized reviews. Cruise plays Roy Miller, framed CIA agent gone rogue, who inadvertently partners up with innocent passenger June Havens (Diaz). The hunt for Roy centers on the Zephyr—a green fusion source the size of AAA battery, and the teen genius inventor Simon Feck (authentically geeky Paul Dano), who was under Roy's watch.""Knight and Day"" is an action romantic comedy done well--simply a fun summer movie. I think ""Knight and Day"" may suffer from Cruise's Oprah sofa bounce, and perhaps from being formulae. Director Mangold keeps it fresh and moving. The story spans the globe from Wichita and Boston to Madrid, and the Alps. The cinematography is vibrant and striking. Writer Patrick O'Neil's screenplay is surprisingly clever, and funny. And there is signature action and humor. Cruise looks tight dispatching assassins on a passenger plane using kick-boxing and Aikido. Cruise and Diaz maneuver on motorcycle through the stampeding bull run in Spain in a spectacular display, and Cruise calculatedly attempts to save Diaz from agents seeking to kill her while on the hood of their speeding car. In one of my favorite scenes, after June is drugged with truth serum by evil arms dealer, she tells her rescuer Roy that she really wants to have sex. Roy tells June, ""You need to hydrate."" ""Knight and Day"" charms often, because it zigs, when you expect it to zag.Roy may have been framed as going rogue by someone in the agency. Writer O'Neil expertly veers smartly through this convoluted narrative. On the surface the accidental meeting of Roy and June is premeditated. Predictably they fall for each other. However, certain clues like Roy killing a bunch of dangerous bad guys on their airline ride are an obvious red flag. Cruise plays it so earnest—this works. He uses his movie star presence, tempered as this loyal and manic hero. We root for him as he clears his name, and protects June from collateral mishap. Diaz is amazing. Whether looking stunning in her bikini off the grid or heart broken when she thinks Roy betrays, she is vulnerable and completely beguiling. Both leverage their tangible chemistry, and understatedly shade their characters. Cruise smoothly hints at a mysterious and compromised past. Diaz plays out the subtle loneliness of June, who feels both empowered and protected with Roy.""Knight and Day"" is not at all Oscar fare. It is however, raucous fun and funny with some breathtaking stunts. Cruise and Diaz overcome the formulae with their spirit and charisma. In retrospect the story makes more sense, which is also unexpected. ""Knight and Day"" is a fun summer ride.",Knight and Day

Still, being both mindless and breezy, the film takes Tom Cruise for everything he's worth and pushes him in the forefront, letting him work all his natural stardom-talent and looks, never interfering with anything, in any sense. He runs the show, he's the spiegelfuhrer, and luckily, the camera locks in on him about 90% of the film. Cameron Diaz plays his love interest, blond, giggly, independent, and seemingly without ability to contribute to our hero's advantage except making further ruckus for him to solve. The film acts much like Alfred Hitchcock's 'North by Northwest', as we're taken on a spectacular journey where the plot is driven by a MacGuffin (which Hitchcock used a lot), and the narrative actions concerns set-pieces of explosions and gun fights. Condition mentioned, most importantly this film oughta be entertaining and joyous; and it is!

103,Likes_Ninjas90,Never quite as funny or thrilling as it should be,6,17 July 2010,"Flying in to attend her sister's wedding, June (Cameron Diaz) bumps into the same man twice at the airport. His name is Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) and they end up on the same flight together. The plane is almost empty but Roy and June make the most of the situation and spark up a conversation. When she goes to the bathroom however, Roy sparks into action and defends himself against a group of would-be attackers. Although June is left in shock and disbelief, Roy takes it upon himself to crash-land the plane. He briefly splits with June but realising the danger he quickly rediscovers her and takes her on an adventure, pitting them against his former CIA colleagues. Roys' adversary is Fitzgerald (Peter Sarsgaard) and they are both looking for a device known as the Zephyr, a battery which can be used as a significant power source, developed by a geek named Simon (Paul Dano).James Mangold's film, which he directed from a screenplay by Patrick O'Neill, makes little room for logic. This is an all-out action picture that is at least aware of its own absurdity. It sacrifices a cohesive plot in favour of staging improbable stunts throughout a variety of beautiful locations. The film was shot in the USA, Spain, Jamaica and Austria and the action in each of these places is slickly handled. In keeping with the film's frivolous tone however, the stunts are performed with minimal intensity and without physical limitations. Most of these sequences exist purely to allow the film to be as crazy and over the top as possible, rather than to develop the plot, making them less exciting than they should be. Cruise is most adept at the hand to hand fight sequences, which are admittedly slightly more visceral. By the final quarter the film seems to run out of steam, hinting at who can and can't be trusted, but it thankfully recovers with an exciting motorcycle chase amidst the running of the bulls. It is disappointing in this sequence and others though that for a big budget action film the visual effects are slightly more apparent and visible than they should be.What carries this film for quite a while is the undeniable charisma of the dual leads. Cruise and Diaz are two of the biggest names in Hollywood and they do share some nice chemistry together. They do well with a script that provides merely serviceable dialogue, rather than anything particularly funny or witty. More humour rather than just crazy action sequences would have helped to sustain the film for a lot longer. By the end, Knight And Day simply reminds us though that Cruise is capable of so much more. With his most intense performances Cruise can subvert his charm into something more sinister and intense. Two of his very best performances in the films Collateral (2004) and Magnolia (1999), which he was nominated for an Oscar for, are indicative of this. They reflect how the credibility of this powerful dramatic actor is regularly overshadowed by his personal beliefs and public relations issues. For all of his natural charisma Cruise is simply put through the motions here. His self-parodying is admirable and he does look cool and comfortable as an action star but this is hardly a challenging role for him. Diaz has a surprisingly nice presence here and is actually quite likable and attractive when she's isn't shrieking. What is certainly missing from the cast is a great villain. This could have been a deliberate omission so that the leads are not upstaged. It is a void that is never filled by Peter Sarsgaard, who is given little do and is unfortunately miscast. Paul Dano has an equally superfluous role as well with some appalling facial hair too.Although one can enjoy some of the self-awareness and lack of pretension with this genre film, it is never quite as funny or thrilling as it should be. More humour would have helped to truly subvert the action genre and sustain the film through its sluggish final quarter. It relies so heavily on the natural charisma of its leads and their star power that it fails to offer anything more substantial for those who are looking for more substance and less noise. As great as some of the locations look on the big screen, this is a film that should probably be reserved as a rental.",Knight and Day
104,Christian_Dimartino,The best movie of the Summer so far.,10,27 June 2010,"Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz star in an unoriginal but hilariously ridiculous Knight and day. Knight and day is the Romancing the stone for our ages. Knight and day has a lot to admire. It's very funny, very interesting, very entertaining, though a bit on the ridiculous side, it is my favorite film of the Summer so far.Knight and day revolves around June Havens(played by Cameron Diaz,playing her goofy self). When she gets on an airplane with Roy Miller(played excellently by Tom Cruise), things spiral out of control. She finds out that he is a spy and she goes on the run with him.The rest of the plot isn't for me to describe. But I will anyways. Roy tries to protect Joy and himself from the C.I.A. Peter Sarsgaard plays the real rogue agent who is trying to steal a nuclear battery from a scientist(played by Paul Dano).There is a lot to admire about Knight and day. The thing that mainly makes it work is Tom Cruise. Cruise's presence is really nicely timed here. Some of us believe that he is crazy. He may be a little crazy, but after seeing films like Jerry Maguire, Magnolia(his greatest acting job),and Tropic thunder, we can tell that he can be funny, and that he's a good actor.Diaz doesn't even have to try. She is goofy and lovable always. No matter what happens. She may play a role that it seems she plays a lot, but in some people's eyes, Cruise plays himself. The actors don't try,but they are delightful. The charm that they deliver is the main specialty of the film. Both actors are very talented,and funny,and lovable.The actors are lovable, and so is the film. I loved it. I knew i'd like it, I was excited for it. I went to see it last night and everyone I went with was skeptical. And they loved it too. Knight and day is so much fun. Beautiful places, good action, good acting, lots of laughs. This is a good romantic action comedy.Out in theaters also is Killers with Ashton Kutcher and Katherine Heigel. I haven't seen it, but i'm sure that this is a ton better. The upgrade. Better actors, not so predictable. And with a better director(James Mangold).Mangold has directed excellent films such as Walk the line, 3:10 to Yuma,and Girl,interrupted. Diaz and Cruise first starred in 2001's Vanilla sky, which I heard was a bomb. Knight and day, though not entirely original, is perfect.

But even though the comedy is amusing and the action scenes weren't directed by a hummingbird on cocaine, it's just not worth the trip to the theater.June (Cameron Diaz) is an average woman on her way home to Wichita to attend her sister's wedding. En route, she meets the charming Roy Miller (Tom Cruise). Before long, June is dragged on an adventure with Roy to prevent a super-powered battery from being sold on the black market.""Knight and Day"" is more of a love story than an action movie. The espionage story drives the plot, but it only serves to build the relationship between June and Roy. Cruise and Diaz have plenty of chemistry between them, but I just wish it was in a better movie. The story is too silly and the film tries way too hard for laughs, almost to the point of desperation.The problem is that it's too understated (but not in the way that Judd Apatow movies are). Undoubtedly, this is what director James Mangold was going for. To that extent, he succeeds; the relationship between Roy and June feels like a warm glow. But this kind of romance does not merge well with an action movie plot.""Knight and Day"" is definitely watchable, but it's just not as fun as it wants to be.

While there were activists in earlier days, they weren't as obnoxiously outspoken as they are today. Thus, destroying their stock.
Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz were stars. Real stars. Charisma you cannot fake through these glib stupid jokes they shoehorn into Disney/Marvel movies nowadays. Instead, their onscreen personality just...shined.
Many won't recognize this because they have some perceived notion of celebrity these days. That Tom's insane Scientologist background would somehow make him less entertaining. Instead, this movie, in hindsight is MUCH more fun than I remember seeing the first time.
And it says more about today's lousy cinema. Perhaps movies today are SO bad, you can reflect on a movie a decade old and realize we didn't have it so bad. I do recall watching this and thinking it was subpar to what I was promised. Having endured awful social justice stupidity of Hollywood, a truly escapist film, like this, was a balm.
Yeah, it has some problems, but it's simply all about entertainment value without the message.

110,moviemanMA,"If you're in a pickle, just drug the girl",4,27 June 2010,"Knight and Day is the latest film starring Tom Cruise alongside Cameron Diaz and Peter Sarsgaard. Cruise plays Roy Miller, a secret agent of sorts who accidental encounter with June (Diaz) sets off a chain of events that June would never have expected. Nevertheless the calm and cunning Miller is ready for anything.Miller has gone rogue or as he claims to have been set up by his agency. He has in his possession the zephyr, a potentially groundbreaking new energy source. His job of protecting the zephyr and its creator named Simon (played by Paul Dano) gets more complicated with June around.I don't feel like I need to get too into the plot. It's pretty obvious where this film goes. What you need to know is where it fails, and that could take a while.Neither of the characters make sense. Roy Miller is supposedly a secret agent who was trained to be void of emotion and feeling, going as far as cutting ties with his family. Yet for some reason he shows such affection for June who really serves no purpose to his cause. Why is he so charismatic and charming towards her. Aren't there more important things to take care of?June is an enigma as well. She runs an auto repair garage in Boston and has an ex-boyfriend who is a firefighter named Rodney (whose existence really does nothing for the film except allow for a few funny jokes). She plays the typical klutzy, clumsy, and extremely feminine sidekick running around screaming and doing the opposite of what Miller wants her to do (yet he always seems to forgive her). What I really don't get is not only does she have a change of heart for Miller (predictable) but she seems to gain some cunning and even some intelligence. How she does this, I don't know. But by the end of the movie you can basically call her a secret agent, too.The biggest flaw is the writing. What I was hoping for was a smart, sexy, and engaging screenplay, resulting in some clever banter between Diaz and Cruise. That's what I was so excited about. The trailers would make you believe that Cruise would play a more comical role than Diaz, which is true to some extent, but he didn't live up to what I was hoping for. He had some flashes of genius, only to be outdone by some rather terrible lines.The writing really falls on its face with the holes in the plot. These gaps in the story are ""fixed"" by drug induced blackouts. In order for Miller and June to get out of a hairy situation, he simply drugs her or knocks her out. We see flashes of what happens, but we finally wake up in a safe and secure location. It's funny maybe once, but three or more times is just ridiculous.Knight and Day has all of the makings of a funny action/comedy like True Lies. A strong male lead, exotic locations, and good stunts galore, the latter is actually one of the better parts of the movie. Cruise has several moments that remind us of his old self. Great stunt driving and a lot of falls (and of course the iconic Tom Cruise run). That's all but lost in this disheveled and confused summer blockbuster. Also, a word to the people involved with creating the title: make sure it makes sense. Yes, the word Knight is used in the film, but why is it in the title. The song ""Night and Day"" isn't even used in the film. Did they just take one small, insignificant aspect of the film and throw it into a commonly used catchphrase? Really? Come on.",Knight and Day

And absolutely nothing bares more than a second's thought: ask any sensible question and the whole thing falls apart. But then it isn't supposed to be anything other than that kind of film and if you like the formula, you might well enjoy it. Me, I only watched the full film out of duty because I knew I would be writing this review.Tom Cruise does his Tom Cruise thing, Cameron Diaz her Cameron Diaz thing and the rest of the cast follow orders and provide the scenery.

113,drpainters,Essentially mission impossible romcom,9,2 February 2020,"Such a good fun movie. Pretty much a mission impossible style romcom and it's so much fun, Diaz during her Charlie's angels days. Lot of fun to watch this one .",Knight and Day
114,diac228,"A collage of mayhem, action, flaws, and charm, Knight and Day is saved by the leads and unique summer freshness",7,23 June 2010,"Jump-starting the Mysterious Plot Summer Season (Knight and Day, Salt, Inception, Piranha 3-D), Knight and Day is quite an interesting thrill ride that's very fresh in the midst of a summer season with very little originality. With the two leads delivering charismatic, fun, and great performances, this movie is propelled by star power, intrigue, and never allowing the audience to be one step ahead of the flick. The twists and turns may have been a little unnerving, and the movie does suffer from being quite vague at times, the overall package is a fun one. Unlike most summer clunkers (there was some robot movie last year that was dismally pathetic, if only I remember the name) this one is forgivable for its flaws because of its style, loose direction, and freshness.Without revealing too much (trust me, predicting the movie from the trailer will do you no good), Knight and Day follows a secret agent (Tom Cruise) that accidentally involves a bystander (Cameron Diaz) in the middle of a crazy fight spanning multiple agencies and multiple countries. Written by Patrick O'Neal, this script is very unique, very refreshing, and at times quite off-the-wall. The story moves very fast, but has time for some character development and character revelations—even if they become little blurbs here and there. The only issue is that characters are revealed in such quick and awkward manners, but it might be more an editing issue rather than a writing issue.Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise were perfect for their leading roles here. Cameron Diaz has an undeniable charm that has made her not only a major box office draw over the years, but one of the few actresses that can carry any movie past mediocrity. At the same time, Tom Cruise also has the ability to propel movies with his impeccable charm and subtle timing. So, naturally, with these two together, movie magic is accomplished. Just like in Vanilla Sky (even if the editing and obscurity allowed the movie to collapse), Knight and Day is jump-started and propelled by Diaz and Cruise acting together. Their comic timing is great, and can still deliver the emotions when you need them to. Everyone else did a respectable job, but they consisted of dozens of small roles.The movie however suffers from one major flaw: potential. This movie could have been something very special if it had been given a little more love, a bit more budget, and better editing. James Mangold is heavily varied in his directing resume (Cop Land, Walk the Line, Identity, 3:10 to Yuma) so he has the ability to run an action film (unlike the indie-director of the last James Bond flick). But, the movie does this mildly irritating thing in which it sets up potential action sequences, but skips them entirely. While the movie does offer plenty of action, this irritating directing/editing blunder was done at least three times. The fact that it could have done so much more doesn't distract from the overall quality, but does unveil its potential. With a budget of over $120 million, Knight and Day looks like an action movie that was running out of cash.The action that we do get to see is plentiful, and fun. Plausibility and realism takes a timeout as we get insane chases, dozens of explosions, and plenty of fights. There is very little slowdown, very little time for the audience to breathe. The CGI is sometimes a bit much, but doesn't distract too much from the movie. Adding to the mayhem is the dozens of plot twists and turns, which range from small, to changing the flick entirely. Unfortunately, it seems like it was edited by someone with a samurai sword and too much sugar in his blood.Bottom Line: While it could have been so much more, and could have really been something truly special, Knight and Day is still an admirable movie thanks to its leads---even if age is starting to catch up to them. With a crazy script edited in a crazy manner, this movie is far from your average summer movie, and is a mildly refreshing visual trip around the world. No sequel or remake connections here, as the plot is unique, even if the action is your usual CGI-heavy fare. The directing, editing, and content choices however keep it from truly hitting the big leagues. But if you want something different and sequel-free to watch this summer (without screaming for mercy as the movie continues), then Knight and Day is your flick. Unique concept, unique movie, unique flaws.",Knight and Day
115,Magow-Intermean,Knight and Day Review,8,24 March 2019,"When commitment-phobic June Havens (Diaz) bumps into uber-spy Roy Miller (Cruise), it takes an on-rush of ditched planes, car chases, shoot-outs, bombing raids, train fights and general global mayhem for her to realise he may be the man of her dreams.
As balding, gut-bucketed potty-mouth Les Grossman, Tom Cruise's feckless alter-ego in Tropic Thunder, made clear - Ethan Hunt isn't taking himself too seriously these days. He's all about parody, refusing straight-up spy-clobber such as Salt and The Tourist for this full-throttled caper, almost but not quite a deliberate send-up of Cruise's IMF-persona.
Top Gun-grinning and chest-bearing, Cruise is Roy Miller, a rogue agent with the superhuman teckers to land crashing jets, hop between hurtling sedans and mow down henchmen with a supersized Uzi. Mostly while bickering with hostage-cum-love interest June (Cameron Diaz). He's a joke, of course, but not Austin Powers (or Les Grossman) madcap. Just ten degrees off centre, and for the initial third we half suspect he's a genuine nutball. The CIA claims he's off the reservation, but the idea gets discarded in the ensuing blitzkrieg.
It's breathless stuff: no chance of boredom, no space for finesse. Miller and June collide cute at an airport, next thing this charmer has ""deactivated"" everyone else on the Wichita-Boston red-eye and they're crash-landing in a field. From there, we hop explosively from Boston to The Bronx, the Azores and an Alpine express to find a missing scientist, pursued by the disposable ranks of the US secret service (headed by the smarmy Peter Sarsgaard).
If Mangold had any control over his material, he might have grounded his (obvious) conflation of Hitchcockian romantic peril and hi-tech pizzazz. Hitch is the guiding light. Deliberate nods to classic chase movies like The 39 Steps and North By Northwest are scattered throughout via perilous train rides, exotic settings and devious lovers. Odd Hitchcockian notes include the couple falling asleep at the wheel of a car unknowingly loaded on a juggernaut. There's even a MacGuffin in an everlasting battery created by Paul Dano.
But capering needs a light touch, not a heavy hand. By the second half the laughs fade and it flattens to an '80s thriller, over-enhanced with CG auto-crunch visuals that don't carry the heft of colliding metal.
The action is nihilistic commotion not thrill, closer to the fragging mayhem of video-games than even 007's cruel beginnings. Sure, the film is refracted through the gleam of movie-fantasy (no mention of terrorism, no hint of conscience), but why is this Bay-like glut of clamorous motion so shorn of imagination or humour? One of 100 chase sequences interrupts a Sevillian bull-run, a thundering joke to which there is no punchline, just a load of bull.
A star-based summer flick is welcome and it's not lacking chemistry. But Diaz, unzipping her magnificent grin, so good at offsetting her beauty with tomboyish steel, gets little reward for pluckiness. Her bullet-point backstory (an ex-boyfriend, a sister's wedding, a gift for auto repairs) feels like echoes from forgotten drafts. She's just a sparky personality buffeted by the airwaves of endless rewrites. At least Roy's supposed to be a blank invention - Cruise playing Cruise, a bit woodenly.
At heart, it doesn't know what it wants. Zucker-silly spoof on Cruise conventions? A-list driven odd-couple caper? Straight-with-plenty-of-chaser adventure-romance? If anything, it bears closer resemblance to Notting Hill, an ordinary gal hooking up with Cruise, the onscreen fantasy of him that is. A risky business at the best of times.
They make a fun duo, but none of the constituent genres work in this overbearing action-rom-com.",Knight and Day
116,Ramascreen,Cruise and Diaz Got This!,8,20 June 2010,"--Rama's SCREEN--KNIGHT AND DAY is one of the most fun you'll have at the movies this summer. Fasten your seatbelt and leave the drive at 'Cruise' control. It's non-stop action, entertaining, mysterious, thrilling and full of surprises. What The Bounty Hunter and Killers failed, KNIGHT AND DAY excels. The combination of rom-com and action is as worth watching as the chemistry between Cruise and Diaz who by the way are not only comfortable with each other, they really claim their roles and own this genre like it's nobody else's business.Imagine a less serious Ethan Hunt from Mission Impossible or Ethan Hunt with the just the right shot of effective comedy, and you'll have yourself KNIGHT AND DAY. In a way, it is kinda like the True Lies of this decade. Just like Jamie Lee Curtis, June (Diaz) panics most of the time and just like Arnold, Roy (Cruise) would smoothly save her ass from flying bullets. And Jamie eventually becomes part of Arnold's team. But what makes KNIGHT AND DAY more interesting is its ability to keep you guessing who might actually be the bad guy. I'm not saying action sequences are not gonna be far fetched but this is the kind of movie that you just have to allow to be what it is because it's got enough twists and turns to get you smilin' and satisfied.After Girl Interrupted, Cop Land, Walk The Line, Identity, 3:10 To Yuma and then this, I think it's safe to say that director James Mangold's name is synonymous with good quality films. The difference is, Mangold relaxes a bit with KNIGHT AND DAY, it emphasizes on making Roy Miller seem ten times more invincible than James Bond. There are scenes when Roy and June get captured but after a few minutes of unconsciousness and trying to regain consciousness on June's part, Roy suddenly gets June in a safe place all over again. Sometimes it makes you wish you could see what's going on or how Roy gets them out of that situation but you won't mind it at all because that's when the comedy comes in, along with the interaction between the two characters that will definitely crack you up.If there's one thing I think could be tweaked is that the runtime might be a bit long but hey, I'd rather have this than The Bounty Hunter where it completely doesn't make sense how Aniston and Butler got around to like each other after all their annoying arguments. In KNIGHT AND DAY, it's not tough for June to fall for Roy who is always there as her knight in shining armor, besides, girls love mysterious men. KNIGHT AND DAY feeds on that stereotype, so much so that when her opinion about Roy is compromised, they've spent enough time together that she can somewhat eventually calculate his moves, or at least attempts to. I think Roy is amused by June, he enjoys saving her, despite going through all kinds of trouble doing so. He admires her attention to family, the very thing that he as a spy is forced to leave behind. So there's very little confusion as to how on earth that these two different characters end up in a wacky but convincing romance. It definitely helps to have Cruise and Cameron in the lead. Cruise is charming and badass, and it's funny that his character remains polite even in the middle of chaos. Cameron is sexy and irresistible, because even when she's panicking, she doesn't get to the point in which she'll irritate you.--Rama's SCREEN--",Knight and Day

118,dvc5159,Cruise and Diaz shine in this enjoyable espionage action thriller/romantic comedy.,5,23 June 2010,"In the midst of a summer blockbuster season that is filled with predictable remakes and sequels (""Toy Story 3"" doesn't count) - ""Knight and Day"" manages to keep the audience at their toes and their attention span glued to the screen.Well, this film is certainly interesting, to say the least. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz are very unlikely co-stars so casting them in a movie together will have their fans scratching their heads. Is it a Cruise action flick? Or is it a Diaz romantic comedy?The answer is both.Among all the romantic action/comedy/thrillers out this year (""Date Night"", ""The Bounty Hunter"", ""Killers""), ""Knight and Day"" surpasses them in both scale and quality, slightly upstaging ""Date Night"". Surprisingly the film delivers what it promises - action, intrigue, laughs, romance, and most important of them all - escapism. This is definitely a spy fantasy come true - exotic locations, exhilarating action sequences, evil baddies, and plot twists galore. Yes, some of them are absurd, but keep in mind that the film is also a comedy, it's meant to be absurd. If you don't like it, stop reading this review and avoid watching this film.Cruise and Diaz play each other off very comfortably and both are terrific in the roles that they were given. The chemistry between them is terrific, as if the time between this film and ""Vanilla Sky"" nine years ago didn't affect them at all. Cruise does what he does best as the super (sometimes TOO super) secret agent - he also has great comedic timing to boot, poking fun at his ""Mission: Impossible"" character with tongue-in-cheek wit; while Diaz scurries around as an average Jane thrust into an unusual situation with lots of charm and cuteness from her. Peter Sarsgaard, Jordi Molla, Viola Davis and Paul Dano give good supporting performances that I would not spoil for you readers.Like I said earlier, the action sequences are WAY over-the-top, with a few scenes of obvious CGI, and sometimes the editing was a wee bit faster than usual, and some of the action sequences end too quickly and lose their momentum. Then again, there is almost non-stop action from start to finish when it first starts. Director James Mangold is a director of various types of films, and he shows a knack for directing tension-filled and exhilarating action sequences. The script is well- written given its type, and holds on to our interest. Production design and cinematography are great and holds up well compared to other action thrillers, but it's the music score that really stands out - John Powell, again, creates a fantastic music atmosphere that really puts you into the mood - be it romance and comedy or espionage and intrigue.In short, I really enjoyed watching this movie, and it's nice to see a movie that is meant for pure popcorn entertainment, pure escapism that is NOT based on a old movie/TV-series or another bland sequel. Cruise and Diaz are terrific together and I hope they do another film together.Entertainment value: 10/10Overall: 7/10 (Solid fun.)",Knight and Day
119,gary-444,"Light, Frothy, Summer, Fun",5,13 August 2010,"This is no classic, nor will it feature on the lists of the involved party's best work, yet as a straightforward popcorn pic, it's quite a lot of fun. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz dominate, and do a good job at carrying the picture. The action sequences are good, but the story is awkward, and the dialogue frequently terrible. That nine writers were involved in a series of rewrites is no surprise.Although billed as a comedy ,laughs are in short supply. But this is more than compensated for by a series of excellent set piece action scenes, the best of which is set in Seville, Spain. Indeed it is the locations and action which save the story from a slow death, combined with the energy and brio of the leads.The plot is simple enough, spy Cruise involves an unsuspecting Diaz in a swirl of danger, mystery intrigue, and excitement, and they fall romantically for one another. The running gags are cringe worthy, and the humour forced, but is not intended to be taken seriously and an early shoot out on a plane, of which Diaz is apparently unaware, does raise a smile. Director James Mangold has done some good work previously in the Chair with ""3:10 to Yuma"" and ""Walk the Line"" and as a writer with ""Copland"". Here he scrapes respectability by the skin of his teeth.",Knight and Day
120,Jackpollins,Never A Dull Moment,8,24 June 2010,"Even as someone who was getting tired of both Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz, I was looking forward to this movie. I though it looked like great fun and a chance for both Diaz and Cruise to make a fun comeback. Indeed I was right. Diaz and Cruise's comic and romantic chemistry is perhaps the best part of it. You just believe that they really would like one another and create some exciting scenes and great laughs off of each other. In the film, Cruise plays Roy Miller, a secret agent who one day meets June Haven (Diaz), a woman with a pretty plain life. She then figures out he's a secret agent. Thus our funny, action-packed, exciting adventure begins. The great supporting cast including Paul Dano, Viola Davis, and Maggie Grace also doesn't hurt. Cruise and Diaz have been losing the sparks in their careers for a while, and they get that spark right back with Knight And Day. I think this is a great step up for not only their careers, but for a young actor like Dano who has a very bright future ahead of him. I didn't come for plot or good acting, but I got plot and good acting, and I had a lot of fun. I don't know about you, but that's a highly recommendable film to me.",Knight and Day
121,bobbobwhite,A great comic book on film,7,7 July 2010,"Great action thriller with very creative comical twists and lots of cute mugging by the two biggest smiles in show biz, Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise. Biggest by a mile. Did the producers put them together for their big smiles? Hmmmmm.Nonstop, more or less mindless action and wild car/cycle chases with lots of inaccurate shooting by the bad guys and dead-on shooting by Mr. Wonderful Tom, always, as he killed his 100+/- bad guy quota each and every day it seemed. Maybe more. Great CGI throughout is common now in most films, but it always thrills when it is well done, as in all the wild and very violent action scenes in this one.Tom's character's constant icy cool and calming reassurance of ""June, June, June"" in a quiet but steadying voice in the middle of murderous mayhem when Cameron as June was always freaking out in terror was the funniest thing in the film, along with the very funny airplane bathroom bit. You have to see this one, it is so creative.Wonderful escapist nonsense for the summer with no relationship to any reality, but it really did work well to keep us from thinking of any more serious issues for 2 hours of well done nonstop madness and mayhem.That's what makes a successful film and a lot of money.",Knight and Day
122,webmaster-3017,HK Neo Reviews: Knight and Day,6,3 August 2010,"Mindless entertainment...Knight and Day can be fun if you want it to be. There is no point going into this film with an Inception mindset. It is not a film that will blow you away, but rather allow you to relax and enjoy the ride. In a way, this is most probably Cruise most charismatic performance in a long mile and the aging Diaz; she still remains one of Hollywood most attractive and genuine laughter and smile package. The action sequences are a joy to watch, even if the suspension of belief is way over the top. The dialogue is cheesy, cool and random, but it is one of those films.Tom Cruise plays a secret agent trying to protect and sell an everlasting battery. I have never seen a movie where Cruise talks so much, almost non-stop. While it may seem annoying at the beginning, it is really just part of the film. As for Cameron Diaz, it's been a while where she venture back into her winning comedy mode. After last year's dramatic turn in My Sister's Keepers, Diaz is far more relaxed when smiling and being randomly high with that famous laughter and grin. As for the chemistry between the two leads, there are some noticeable sparks, but at best, it is only workable. The Austrian dealer chick is hot and worthy of a mention.All in all, Knight and Day is pure mindless entertainment. It's not a film that will stay with you, but its certainly a fun film what it is. Should we forgive Cruise for jumping up and down the crouch? Probably not, but at least, he made something fun for us...(Neo 2010) I rate it 6.5/10www.thehkneo.com",Knight and Day

124,Jerique,"A masterpiece in comedy, romance and action!",9,8 July 2010,"What really makes Knight and Day a fun movie is a fully-packed theater. I've personally seen this twice now and it's so much fun in the theater to hear the entire room crack up on the jokes.I'm surprised to see there is people who do in fact like or even love Tom Cruise as much as me. Regardless of Cruise or Diaz lovers and haters, this movie is fun for everyone. Cruise excels at playing a spy but until recently, I've only seen him as a serious spy (ie. Ethan Hunt; Mission Impossible).Diaz is easy on the eyes but she gets an enormous amount of laughs for her role and the chemistry between Cruise and Diaz is a delight to watch. The action of Knight and Day is non-stop as much as the laughs. The small amount of romance is enough to make this a great date movie.It's clever, witty, charming and above all, great fun. Tom Cruise is still the man when it comes to spy and comedy type movies. It's not the best film of the year, but it's certainly my favourite thus far.

126,basrutten,Was expecting a bit more,6,18 July 2010,"After the generally fairly positive reviews for this movie, I was hoping for a bit more than what I got. It's not a bad movie per se, but it heavily leans on the star power of Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz, and doesn't do anything that hasn't been done a dozen times before, and often better.The movie does get off to a strong start though. The initial half hour with the aircraft fight and the highway chase are very funny and fluent action sequences. But the movie runs out of steam very fast, becoming a fairly generic series of half-finished action sequences.Which is a shame, since more could have been done with this. But it seems that almost every time that an action sequences starts to become interesting, it just abruptly ends, and we end up in a totally different location, usually after one of the characters has been knocked out. I don't mind that the action is over the top, but I do mind this kind of lazy story telling. It is needlessly confusing, it kills the suspense, and it just feels like half the movie is missing.Cruise and Diaz, meanwhile, do their utmost best and do actually manage to produce some funny lines and situations. But their characters remain shallow and rather boring, and the supporting cast is wholly unremarkable.In the end, this movie is still mildly entertaining. It's an uncomplicated over the top action movie with some big names in it and a couple of novel action sequences. But I can't help but feel that it could and should have been a lot better.",Knight and Day
127,canuckteach,You'll like it - my wife did... and it's kind of a tribute film..,8,8 July 2010,"This Cruise-Diaz vehicle was fast-paced and witty. My wife is not a Cruise lover, nor a fan of action films, but she laughed harder than I did. At one point, I thought we'd have to hospitalize her.The film starts a bit offbeat with a 'chance' meeting at an airport. Suspense builds as Cruise and Diaz engage in small talk on a commuter plane, with some turbulence making for a bumpy ride. You know something is up. When Diaz goes to the washroom, all hell breaks loose. Let's just say that when she exits from the can, the passengers on the plane are all sitting very quiet-like. Cruise tries to explain calmly and patiently. Diaz doesn't know if he's serious. But the pilots are quiet-like, too. Thus our adventure begins. Someone is after something, well, more than *one* 'someone' -- and Cruise has the goods (the 'MacGuffin' - the device Hitchcock used to drive the plot).I suppose there is a formula for these guy-girl buddy action flicks, but if the content is witty, and the story is pleasant to watch, we can forgive even if it's all been done before. After all: how many 'innocent man caught up in intrigue' did Hitchcock do?Knight & Day actually takes pains to mimic movie components & devices we've seen in the past, almost by way of tribute. Here's a few:1> a well-trained agent and an innocent girl on the run - (Bourne Identity) 2> everyone is after a valuable package he has (the MacGuffin device: Hitchcock) 3> a double-dealing CIA agent (Syriana - same dude, too) 4> Cruise looking over his sunglasses (Risky Business) 5> chasing bulls being led to the bullfight arena (City Slickers - same type of overhead angles, also!) 6> escape from a suspended torture/interrogation predicament (Lethal Weapon) 7> weapons, electronics, driving-to-escape expert (Bourne, again) 8> silly or impossible travel at high-speed (Mission Impossible) 9> bumpy ride on a plane (Red Eye)These days, you have to 'vett' even the PG films very carefully if you don't want to see a lot of smarmy stuff.

It isn't clear if the filmmakers wanted this to be a parody of the Mission Impossible & Bourne type movies or an addition to the genre.The plot is far fetched to say the least. Cruise plays an FBI agent who appears to have gone rogue. He bumps into Diaz at an airport and after that they keep ending up together as he is responsible for a mounting body count.The comic lines are very cheesy and the film is a bit too long but I found that by leaving the film wash over me and not analysing it too much I enjoyed it.I can understand how someone might dislike the film, as it is, essentially, ridiculous.

When June arrives to the airport, a man named Roy (Tom Cruise) bumps into her. What seems like an innocent accident turns into something more as Roy tries to keep June from boarding her flight home. When he fails from keeping June from boarding the plane is where the fun begins. While June heads to the airplane bathroom to powder her nose, we find out that the entire plane is full of armed men wanting to arrest and/or kill Roy. Roy takes out the armed men and now warns June that there was a reason he didn't want her to board the plane. Now, Roy and June must join forces and work together to protect a new invention that's so big that even the FBI wants a part of the action. A nonsensical but action packed and fun movie ensues...Within the first 20 minutes of ""Knight and Day"" I knew why people hated this movie. First off, it makes very little sense and its really out there. Don't get me wrong, this is a really fun movie but don't expect to ""get"" it because it doesn't make any sense. The action sequences are over the top, Diaz and Cruise look like they are having a blast the entire time, and the movie is somehow interesting despite the plot making no sense. It's a brainless summer movie with some dark humor tossed into the mix. Not what you would expect from the normal Tom Cruise action flick and therefore why people didn't enjoy it that much.While there are a lot of names in this film, Cruise and Diaz are the main stars and everyone else seems virtually unimportant. Cruise does a great job on this film with playing a wacky FBI rogue agent. He really uses his action star skills along with his comedic skills in this flick. Diaz, besides coming off as a brainless ditz, is fun to watch on screen. She really plays the clueless role in the film well and looks like she is having a ton of fun while doing it. I enjoyed watching her and Cruise because they have some really solid chemistry and know how to play off one another. The supporting cast consists of pretty solid actors although they are underused including Peter Sarsgaard and Viola Davis.The screenplay for ""Knight and Day"" was written by Patrick O'Neill, who hasn't written much besides a television series called ""Dead Last."" The script didn't lack action nor did it lack comedy, however, it did lack common sense. This movie made no sense and I really had a ton of plot holes. If you watch the movie you will wonder how can they get all these places so fast? How can they avoid being shot so many times? How is there no one flying this plane? How does Cruise jump from car to car when they are going 75 miles an hour? Those are just a few of the questions I have with the film. I also have questions about the plot, which has to do with a high school drop out who invented a top secret energy source that is the size of a battery. Why do so many people know about this? Why is it so valuable? And there are plenty more questions but hey this truly puts the title of mindless action flick to good use.The oddest thing about the film to me was that it was directed by James Mangold. For those who aren't familiar with the name, he is the man who directed ""Walk the Line,"" the western remake ""3:10 to Yuma,"" and the intelligent and underrated thriller ""Identity."" This movie just seemed like a odd choice for Mangold because he usually does dramas with some light action mixed in. This film was an action comedy and definitely not something Mangold has a lot of experience with. He did a fairly decent job with the film and really helped make sure Cruise and Diaz had fun with the film and looked good doing it.At the end of the day, I wouldn't say I loved ""Knight and Day"" but than again I don't usually love any action comedy. It was completely nonsensical but it was a fun and enjoyable action flick. It's not your typical action movie because it mixed a bit of dark and demented humor. Its plot makes no sense and nothing about the film is serious at all. Everyone is acting goofy and looks like they are having fun working on the film. I liked it but that's because I appreciated it for what it was. People expecting the typical action film will probably not like it as much as they would like and those who want to see it for the comedy aspect alone will probably be a tad disappointed as well. I can see how this had mixed reviews and mixed audience reactions. Its not for everyone but for those who are bored with the typical action film nonsense, you may like this one. It's a fun action packed ride, that's for sure! MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""Knight and Day"" is a 7 out of 10.",Knight and Day
132,GirishGowda,"""I shot the pilot, who accidentally shot the second pilot! Its just one of those things!""",8,16 July 2010,"You cannot go into this type of movie without suspending your logic and belief about gravity and many other improbable things. But you know what? Cameron Diaz has one of the best grins and Tom Cruise is still a hunk and a charmer, they make us enjoy the movie, with all its stupid contrived plots and overwhelming action sequences. Me and my friends all loved the movie. I didn't know its genre and hadn't seen the trailers for the movie, but went to see it as I am a fan of both Cruise and Diaz. After the dramatic Valkyrie (which was in 2008, took a full 2 years for Tom to make another movie!), it was good to see Tom back in a mindless action movie. Diaz and Tom team up again after a long time. In 'Vanilla Sky' they didn't have enough screen time together. Director James Mangold knows that this isn't a movie which has to be taken seriously and has made the actors have fun with it. The cgi effects are quite well done (obviously) and the cinematography is excellent. Most of the locations are just so grand and beautiful. Not to forget, the excellent bull chase scene in Spain which was awesome. Carrying a bagful of metal junk to repair her father's old car, June Havens (Cameron Diaz) is on her way to her sister's wedding when she accidentally bumps into Roy Miller (Tom Cruise), a charming and handsome man. After repeatedly bumping into each other at the airport and finally finding out that they are on the same flight, they just flirt with each other. She finds out during the course of a rather entertaining flight that Roy is a rogue FBI agent, whose intentions is not exactly clear in the beginning. She is smack in the middle of all the chaos just because she happens to be a witness to something called the Zephyr, a perpetual energy source. June has to figure out who she can trust in this crazy situation; the FBI or Roy? During the course of the story, June and Roy travel all over the globe (Massachusetts, California, Austria, Jamaican Islands, Illinois, Spain among others) to keep the Zephyr away from the bad guys. The FBI and many others are after Roy and the Zephyr, but it turns out that Roy is being framed by his former partner who wants to sell the Zephyr to terrorists. Will June and Roy make it out of this mess in one piece? There is also a sub-plot involving Roy Miller's parents. They think that their son is dead, but they don't know that Roy is keeping an eye on his parents for their safety. That was done just to give a background story on Roy's character. There are a couple of scenes which were definitely more suited for some other genre; Roy disappears from a room when the SWAT team is coming from all the exits of the room and a moment later we are shown him running across the roof top of the opposite building at full speed. That was a scene more suited for the supernatural genre. Well, he is more like Superman than an ordinary person here anyway, so I can forgive that. Tom Cruise is definitely ageing gracefully; he has lost some of his famous boyish looks, but his acting still packs a punch. Cameron Diaz looks gorgeous and still has her comedic timing intact. There are a few scenes where she looks old and haggard at times, but it is understandable as she isn't exactly the new kid on the block. The movie has equal amounts of non-stop banter between Miller and June, romantic tension and an overdose of extremely well choreographed action sequences. Plotwise, Knight & Day doesn't offer anything new, nor do we expect it to be anything new. It is a tried and tested plot of an agent out to protect something, and in this case the thing happens to be a source of infinite energy which could solve the energy crisis around the world. Do we really care about this Zephyr? Not a chance, because it could have been anything and still we wouldn't care about it in the least bit. All we want to see is Tom and Diaz create their magic on screen. One scene I really loved is when there is a chase scene and Roy jumps off from a motorbike and lands on the FBI car and tells calmly to June that her dress is beautiful, while killing off all the agents! The ex-boyfriend scenes were also very funny. Tom Cruise still creates the magic and you have to watch this if you are a hardcore Cruise fan, the comedy and action provides wholesome entertainment. 8/10",Knight and Day

134,krzysiektom,surprisingly good fun and splendid soundtrack,9,17 July 2010,"It was a nice surprise for me. I think Diaz is a revelation, full of sexy charm, while Cruise is quite OK. Both are very likable here and that is the entire point. The music is excellent, it is a simple soundtrack but there was not a bit I would not enjoy listening to and it effectively spunks up the action/tension. Cruise's character is a bit like a 007 on acid trip or cocaine, or something. The locations are beautiful, the plot moves along quickly and while a few action pieces are inevitably over the top and unrealistic it does not take away the fun, overall they were very well made. I have had splendid time watching this and maybe will watch it again with pleasure. Generally I am not a huge fan of neither Diaz nor Cruise, yet here I liked them a lot. And last but not least there is a nice few minutes on a train and I love when films happen on trains.",Knight and Day
135,colinrgeorge,"Fun By Day, Forgotten By Night",6,3 July 2010,"Has ""Knight and Day"" been sitting on a shelf somewhere since the late nineties? I can just imagine some backlot custodian blowing the dust from the canister and proclaiming, eyes wide, ""My God—This was supposed to be released thirteen years ago!""It recalls a simpler time, when summer blockbusters were sold on Hollywood star power rather than franchise familiarity. The stars of ""Knight and Day,"" Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz, now 48 and 37 respectively, are considerably older than the leads of last summer's highest grossing film, ""Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,"" (Shia LaBeouf/Megan Fox, both 24). But while the performers may have passed their commercial 'best by' date, they're nowhere near expiry; they bring a wholesome charisma to the silly script that might otherwise have been embarrassing for its over-the-top protagonists.In fact, the story is so absurd that Cruise and Diaz's performances are probably the only way to sell it. Sure, the twentieth-century goofiness is refreshing in an age where the dour Christopher Nolan is synonymous with action, but the film feels just as often like an instant- relic. ""Knight and Day"" is no ""Dark Knight,"" a fact that is made especially apparent as the film tips into its second half and the tendrils of the overgrown plot start to suffocate it.The difference, appropriately enough, is as stark as day and night. The first half has a constant energy to it, blowing by at such an airy pace that it doesn't really matter what's trite, or nonsensical, or what Peter Sarsgaard's deal is. Cruise plays Roy Miller (a spy every bit as distinctive as his name) who inadvertently becomes involved with Jane Average: June Havens (Diaz), on a flight gone awry. In eluding his aggressors, he must also protect her, while a mutual attraction blossoms—Yada, yada, yada. The latter hour then expounds on why Miller's being chased (a game changing super-battery called a zephyr—Just go with it), and the energy takes a nosedive. There's also greater emphasis on the relationship dynamic, which is anything but the movie's strong suit.In principle, I'm fine with so hollow an action film exploiting clichéd devices—Namely the girl and the McGuffin—But only as shorthand to keep the story moving. The second half of ""Knight"" stops frequently to nurture its ill-begotten narrative, and for the most part, I couldn't care less. Shoot some more guys.However, of the plethora of problems with ""Knight and Day,"" probably the most serious is that it provokes absolute ambivalence in retrospect. Anyone who saw Robert Luketic's ""Killers"" will attest that director James Mangold got something right here, but that something is largely devoid of spark. That Cruise and Diaz (both of whom are overdue for a great starring role) work so well in the film makes its utter averageness all the more resounding. Despite their best efforts, it's still the sort of experience you forget about the same day you have it.The film is just chemical entertainment; fun in a completely artificial way, like some palatable off-brand snack food you'll only eat once. Even with decent action and occasionally successful humor, I wouldn't recommend that anyone actually go out of their way to see it. Or change the channel, for that matter.""Knight and Day"" is a flash in the pan so forgettable that if the studio rereleased it in thirteen years, I'm not sure anyone would notice.",Knight and Day
136,thekyles99,My second favorite of 2010,10,26 September 2010,I've always been a fan of Mr. Cruise. He seems to be selecting the action roles these days like this feature and the upcoming Mission Impossible 4 that is presently filming and that is OK cause he has proved that he can do it all. Cameron Diaz and Tom have amazing on screen chemistry which only adds to the thrill ride this film is. Cameron plays June Havens who unwillingly keeps bumping into Roy Miller (Cruise) at the airport. Little does she know that this will lead into one whirlwind of a relationship. This storyline has loads of plot twists which i like. always keeps you guessing. Loads of action and a stellar cast round out what is one great movie. My second favorite of 2010.,Knight and Day
137,kunalkhandwala,Breezy Summer time Entertainment...,7,1 July 2010,"Summer time brings with it more than just the Sunshine. There is an aura of freshness after months of struggling with gloom, bitter cold and rain. Knight and Day is just that fresh summer time flick that doesn't overpower you with an incoherent or intricate plot but simply entertains you, providing that one element you need - Fun. James Mangold, of Walk The Line and 3:10 To Yuma fame, never made his film look like 'Inception' in the previews and therefore, you get what you expect. A light entertainer that doesn't strain your neurons and appeases the eyes with spectacular locations from around the world and some CGI enhanced, thrilling action sequences. Secret agent Roy Miller tries to elude the authorities by securing the newly developed battery - Zephyr that was developed by Kid genius, when his fate crosses June Haven's and the two follow their precarious path to peril. Chased through continents by the FBI and savvy villains, Roy and June escape bombs, guns, flying cars, bulls and airplanes. Without much navigation through characters and their sub-plots, Knight and Day keeps it simple while engaging you with the action and Cruise's charisma in a role that must be tailor-made for him. Many actors could play secret agents but none with the charm and energy of Tom Cruise. At 47, Tom Cruise is still a convincing action hero who can perform many of the crazy stunts by himself. Playing his charming character seems to come naturally from him and with Cameron Diaz, it does strike an interesting chemistry. Cruise gets to play the cool secret agent, capable of impossible feats, a rogue who is on the verge of turning evil and a half lover who always emerges as that indefatigable hero who walks upon rooftops. In expressing the humorous scenes, Cameron Diaz feels well at home. Her countenance and spontaneity in situations make her look at ease in her role and perhaps that is responsible for creating such good chemistry between the actors. We see the film through June's eyes while she passes out several times, thus transporting us from country to country while Roy takes charge of their escape.At around 110 minutes, the film is well paced with some thrilling action sequences that are consumed faster than popcorn and never fail to excite and surprise. Indeed, most of the CGI effects end up being over-the-top but that is easily overcome with Cruise's energy in his own stunt driven scenes. While there is enough cheeky comedy to keep you entertained in between the action, there is also a digressed sub-plot of the 'Knights' which fails to intrigue or engage. Sarcasm abounds in Knight and Day without being offensive or crude. Another prevalent theme is that of things being quite unreal. A secret agent on the run cannot possibly be so resourceful and there is no need for him to be with June Haven all along. But clearly, that is exactly what stands out in the movie. You cannot relate to any character or situation but from the first scene, can see things as an audience in the cinema where anything can happen and the hero always prevails. In the end, the humor, charm, spectacular locales and the exciting action keeps you engaged without the need for depth, intrigue or darkness. This is a summer time flick and the levity of it should be appreciated. 7.171 on a scale of 1-10.",Knight and Day
138,blacklist-1,"It flopped in the US and rightly so! A film that had potential, which it never reached",4,11 August 2010,"I saw Knight and Day in the trailer and thought it looked great fun with some great action and stunts viewed in the trailer and great acting with witty banter between the two leads. The film seemed a good idea on paper, Tom Cruise playing a charming rogue agent Roy Miller who on the run from his agency sweeps up innocent bystander June played by Cameron Diaz and together try and escape those that are after them. Action, romance and comedy is introduced. I sat in my seat with my friend and we both were looking forward to this almost giddy with anticipation, well we wished we hadn't bothered! Whilst the actions and stunts are quite impressive in a silly way, even then some are a rip-off like when Cruise and Diaz are on the back of the bike and she flips over and sits in front of him and shots at the authorities, remind anyone of a certain Bond film called Tomorrow Never Dies where that happened? The acting between the two main leads is good with some good moments of laughter and visually it looks cool and slick, this is just another Hollywood film all dressed up around gooey syrup with seeming to have intelligence and substance but is thin and dumb in the end with absolutely no romantic chemistry between Crusie and Diaz with thin characters like Roy has parents and a life but that is never delved into, a script that needs work and isn't a witty as it pretends to be with more laughs that should have hit, a story which is basic with some plot-holes in, for example when in the hotel room when June is going to sell out Roy to his agency by pressing a pen point down that alerts them to there location we see Roy standing next to her and then bang! He's gone, all we see are the swat coming in and then somehow Roy has gone onto the next building running along the rooftop, did he disappear out of the window before the swat came in? And did he jump to the next building despite an impossible distance? That's never explained. Also the battery he's got on him, why is everyone so intent on getting it? It heats up and has to be cooled down, but what is it's purpose? I don't think that was ever explained and the acting by Peter Sarsgarrd as the main villain who wasn't interesting and well he just looked bored. This had potential but it never gets there and despite some good moments this film should have just stayed on the paper but as a result us audiences waste our money on a film that lots didn't enjoy and ultimately are left annoyed and left me and my friend conned and extremely disappointed. Lets god hope there isn't a sequel.",Knight and Day
139,Jonathon_Natsis,"Temporary escapism. Nothing more, nothing less.",5,1 February 2011,"JJ Abrams hands over the directing job to the equally-capable James Mangold while Hollywood superstar Tom Cruise returns as Ethan Hunt in what is sure to be the final chapter in the Mission: Impossible saga. Waitwhat? My mistake. It's actually Knight and Day, the action-spy-thriller-with-a-giant-MacGuffin, not similar to M:I 3 at all. But, lucky for Cruise and Diaz, this film is at least different enough from Vanilla Sky to keep me from taking another low blow.Instead, Cruise plays former CIA agent Roy Miller, a man who's recently gone AWOL and has possession of the top secret Rabbit's Foot-I mean, Zephyr battery (I'm finished, I swear). Desperate to keep it out of the wrong hands, he winds up with the help of Diaz's June Havens, an ordinary civilian who has taken a liking to the maverick (And so ends my list of Tom Cruise movie puns).In what is pretty much the definition of an average movie, there is hardly any aspect of this film that stands out as either surprisingly good or offensively bad. Both Cruise and Diaz deliver the goods in the acting department, playing to the nature of each one's character nicely, but without overshadowing one another or the rest of their no-name cast.The overwhelming majority of positive reviews for Knight And Day lavished praise on the effortless on-screen chemistry between the two leads. Maybe it was because I had this in mind while watching, or maybe it was just a case of sheep following the shepherd, but I didn't see anything to suggest that their timing, interplay or ability to improvise was anything above and beyond what one should expect in a film boasting two of the most bankable stars in the industry. Not particularly memorable, but kept my attention, and complimented the quick, impulsive pace of the film after a sluggish start.At about the one-hour mark, the film progressed into a series of events that could have had real potential, if only they were explored and developed properly. As more details about the Zephyr and its connection to the CIA begin to unravel, we actually start to question who are the goodies and the baddies after all. It feels as if Mangold decided a couple of scenes later that he was trying to do to much with a film designed to appeal to the masses. As a result, this character conundrum is quickly settled and, disappointingly, the film hops right back on the beaten track. The climax is entertaining enough, but the following epilogue is what leaves the viewer with a truly sour aftertaste. While watching it, I was reminded of this quote from Robert Downey Jnr. in perennial favourite Kiss Kiss Bang Bang: 'Look, I hate it too. In movies where the studio gets all paranoid about a downer ending so the guy shows up, he's magically alive on crutches, I hate that. Why not bring them all back?'While this quote has little, if anything, to do with Tom Cruise on crutches, it does nicely summarise how I feel about the ending. Given the opportunity to do something a little different, any prospect of innovation is thrown out swiftly, and replaced by an eye-rolling ending with even worse dialogue. As I'm sure you've worked out for yourself by now, this film is nothing new, providing mediocre escapism for two hours on a lazy day.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*",Knight and Day
140,cadillac20,A fun summer popcorn flick,8,26 June 2010,"I didn't initially want to see this film. I'm not a fan of Diaz, and this film looked fairly uninteresting from the trailer. However, I was bored, and some good reviews made me think I could be wrong. Was I ever. This film was consistently fun and displayed Tom Cruise at his best in a long, long time.The film is fairly simple and straight forward. Cruise is a government agent who has gone rogue and is being hunted by his organization. Diaz is an innocent woman who ends up getting caught up in a plot involving Cruise' character, a battery, and a dirty agent. The story, however, is not that bad. It's clichéd, but that isn't really a bad thing here. I expected the story to simply be something cheap to hold the action and comedy up, but it worked surprisingly well. Now, when I say this is Tom at his best in a long long while, I don't mean that little stint from Tropic Thunder. While hilarious, it was a minor role. This is the same kind of energy Tom brought to that, extended into almost two hours. And it's this kind of energy that we like to see. It looks like he had fun making this film, and it really pays off. He's very funny, and the action is excellent, with some fantastic set pieces taking place all over the world. The action also rarely lets up, which is nice. It's good to see that this wasn't a film that was taken too seriously, thank god. Diaz is serviceable, but I'm still not a fan. While the chemistry works great with Cruise, and she is cute, I could see her being replaced with several actresses that I would enjoy much better. To her credit though, she did get a laugh or two out of me.Besides Cruise, the heart of this film is it's action. It's chock full of it. While I didn't enjoy the action in this film as much as I enjoyed the action in A Team (I'm a sucker for the over the top....way over the top), Cruise's charm and humor added to it. His character here is crazy, so watching him be non-chalant about shooting an innocent man in the leg or surfing on a car is pretty hilarious, while also exciting. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the action, because the trailer made the film seem rather dull and typical. However, I will be the first to admit I was wrong, the highlight of the film being the climactic chase. My only big qualms about the film are the villains, who once again, aren't nearly as compelling as Cruise. In fact, I found it very hard to believe that the main villain was once Cruise's partner. He seems to barely keep up with Cruise, who leaps and bounds into action without much hesitation. The other main baddie, some Spanish gun smuggler, was very uninteresting and cliché. I don't know what it is this summer about sucky villains, but these writers should really focus as much on the villains as they do on the heroes. It also wouldn't hurt to find actors who can really bring out the best in these guys.My second problem is in the frequent use of Diaz character getting knocked out. While I think it's an interesting technique for moving the story along, it also seems a bit lazy to me. It also gets old and annoying, and once we've seen Cruise move her from one area of the world to another, the second time around isn't as funny and just borderlines on being annoyingly over the top. It's really more of a minor issue, but I couldn't help but roll my eyes when they did it for something like the fourth time.Besides that, this is a great little summer blockbuster. I thoroughly enjoyed Cruise in this. Even if it is mostly a star vehicle for him (probably supposed to be something of a mini comeback after his more recent cinematic forays), I can't complain. I've always enjoyed Tom Cruise, and this helps continue to establish the fact that he is one of modern Hollywood's greatest products. The writing is also great, as is the directing. Color me surprised, but this was one film I really enjoyed, more so for the fact I didn't think I would. If you've been disappointed with this summer's releases, this film might be right up yer alley for an action fix.",Knight and Day
141,quinnox-1,"Nothing special, but not horrible",6,13 July 2010,"This is an OK movie. Tom Cruise is pretty good in it, and Cameron Diaz, who I normally hate, did a workmanlike job. I would say if you want a romantic comedy then this is a good movie to see. The action scenes are played in a goofy non-serious way so don't expect a real action movie, though plenty of things blow up anyway. Tom Cruise still looks good even if he is older, and basically is in most of these scenes so if you are a fan you will like this. I laughed a few times and there are some pretty funny scenes in it. I wouldn't call this exceptional or great but its a little above average and worth a rental. The major problem I had with this is it went on too long, close to two hours is too much for this kind of movie.

In the bonus features, the stunt coordinator states that she is a professional-quality stunt driver, and that either star could be a professional stunt performer. It's jolly good fun, in no small part due to a lively sequence involving both actors on a Ducati Streetfighter.

If you are looking for a movie that you can have fun with, thiz movie is definitely the one. It's a typical Hollywood popcorn movie. The storyline is predictable, the sequence is easy-watching, the comedy is corny, the action is absurd and they rely much on charisma of two main performers, who in thiz case are Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. Thiz is their second rendevouz since ""Vanilla Sky"" (2001) where the atmosphere was gloomy and serious, so people keep thinking how about to put them in another situation. We know Cruise is an extreme adrenaline junkie in real life with his motorcycle collection and extreme sport activities. Thiz movie is absolutely the perfect vessel for him to do what he always desires to do, for me thiz will be his trilogy extension of ""Mission: Impossible"" (1996-2006). Diaz is charming as always and could merge into anykind of character easily and she does it either thiz time. The most important thing, she looks like to have fun with her character, for me thiz will be her dwilogy extension of ""Charlie's Angels"" (2000-2003). I have to say, even without any addition, ""The Star Power"" of these two main Cast members is very powerful. The Director is James Mangold, a talented drama Director just like he has shown in ""Girl, Interrupted"" (1999), ""Identity"" (2003) and ""Walk the Line"" (2005). In thiz opportunity, Mangold tries his luck in action movie like thiz. Most of the times, some people say, ""Movie is for fun"". In that case, thiz movie provides an effective and entertaining element. The movie will make you forget how things happen, if you are one of the viewers who emphasizes fun factor as your needs.

147,MovieProductions,"The most fun I've had in a long time- And this time, it's not mindless!",8,19 June 2010,"*** out of (****)I just came back from an advanced screening of ""Knight and Day"" and I have to say, I was extremely impressed. I, as well as you, are tired of formulaic Hollywood movies that are disposable and provide little to no new elements to the table. This is the exact opposite of what the final product is of this film. ""Knight and Day"" brings many twists and turns, it is far from by-the-numbers, and is easily unforgettable. For starters, the action is quite remarkable and pretty darn satisfying. And the movie was just hilarious and had great comic timing. It should mean something when I tell you that the crowded audience was laughing. Not just a few people, the WHOLE audience and they took up almost all the seats. ""Killers"", a movie that fits under the action/comedy genre was one that I was looking forward to, but was a huge letdown. ""Knight and Day"" definitely doesn't disappoint and brings the laughs, with the big action. This movie is probably the most fun I've had in a while, and this is coming from a very harsh grader and someone that is let down very easily due to high expectations.""Knight and Day"" revolves around Cameron Diaz, who is boarding a plane to see her sister April get married. At first, she is forbidden to board the plane, but then the flight attendant finds a seat for her. And guess who Diaz sits next to? The inevitable Tom Cruise. After having a little ""talk"" with the pilot, the passengers, and the flight attendant, him and Diaz seek out to hunt down the antagonists, one which is played by Peter Sarsgaard. Although, Cruise warns Diaz that the bad guys will say that they are the ""FBI"" and will pretend she's in a safe place. However, through further investigation, Diaz may think that Cruise is unto something. In the meantime, the bad guys are looking for the battery and are not too thrilled about who holds its possession.First, let's get to the positives. First off, I liked that this movie established character development. Most action/comedy films fail to fully flesh out are leads and then we aren't registered with them. 3:10 to Yuma director makes us care about these characters, and when put in a tough situation, we just hope the best. Second of all, I thought the script was great. I thought this movie had some really funny one-liners and the film had great comic timing. It couldn't have been better. Thirdly, I thought that the performances were great. All the characters did their job and even stood out, especially Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise. Diaz and Cruise also had wonderful chemistry and their relationship never felt forced or phony. It came out as very authentic rather than artificial and syrupy. Moreover, I thought the film's pacing was excellent. The film is shy of two hours, yet feels like half of that. After the film was over, I thought there would be at least another hour added. Furthermore, I thought the action was awesome. It definitely delivered and this is the best action I've seen in a long time. And lastly, the cinematography was just amazing. I loved the scenery and great production values I must add.There are very minimal flaws with this movie. However, there are some. First of all, I know this film is intentionally nonsensical, but some scenes went so over-the-top, that when it occasionally was meant to be serious, it came off as cheesy or laugh worthy, fortunately, like I said, occasionally. Second of all, I enjoyed this movie so much that I just wish it were longer. Overall, ""Knight and Day"" is a great film because of its fresh script, great performances, amazing action, great comic timing, breathtaking cinematography, and a fascinating direction. And for the first time, it's actually not mindless! If you keep your brain on, you'll still thoroughly enjoy it. If you were disappointed by ""Killers"", don't worry, so was I, because you will still like this movie. Shoot, I enjoyed it so much I think it's even better than ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" which I liked. ""Knight and Day"" is one of those rare movies that just works on every level and is one of those rare movies that is worth full admission. See it at night with a large crowd, with a big bucket of popcorn, and a drink, and you'll have a blast. I enjoyed the movie so much that I wanted it to last from ""Knight"" to ""Day"". It comes highly recommended.",Knight and Day
148,eastbergholt2002,Disappointing,5,4 July 2010,"Knight & Day is moderately entertaining and a little disappointing. Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) is a secret agent on the run for a crime he didn't commit. He accidentally meets June (Cameron Diaz) a car mechanic who is in the wrong place at the wrong time. June decides to join the adventure and eventually becomes the film's love interest. Roy and June are chased throughout and the U.S. and Europe by the CIA and a Spanish arms dealer. The film looks expensive and it has high production values. Knight and Day has lots of chases and explosions and it's the type of film that Hollywood is usually very good at making. Miller's fighting skills are almost superhuman and he makes James Bond and Jason Bourne seem second-rate. He kills lots of people but none of it feels real, it's just cartoon violence. The film is mostly played for laughs so there is little tension and you never feel like any real harm will come to the characters. This combination worked well in Mr and Mrs Smith, but Pitt and Jolie were more convincing in their roles and had a wittier script to work with. Unfortunately Knight & Day just felt mediocre and it wasn't very amusing. Secret agents are better when they are angst-ridden (e.g., John Cusack in Grosse Point Blank) but Miller seemed just too perky and nice to be truly believable as an international assassin.Unfortunately Cruise and Diaz seemed to be getting a little old for their parts. Tom is 48 and his character behaved like someone in their twenties. It may have been more enjoyable and believable with a younger cast. The film contained no real surprises and I felt as if I had seen it all before. The ""innocent man on the run"" plot has been used in lots of Hollywood movies and it can seem old and tired. However if you like chases and explosions and beautiful locations and don't want to to think too much then this could be the movie for you. I was hoping for more.",Knight and Day
149,georgioskarpouzas,"action and romance, comedy and adventure",7,19 July 2010,"This is a very characteristic movie in the sense that it is single-minded as far as it's identity is concerned.It has a lot of action, killing, flying, driving, running;black humour and a romantic touch-the attraction between two very charming protagonists:Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz.This movie is addressed not to the logic or higher faculties of the audience, but to their physical reflexes, that derive from our primate ancestors and to the joys that action and romance offer us devoid of metaphysical perplexities and moral quandaries.Nevertheless, there is a moral to the story, in the sense that the hero, Roy Miller, despite being a compulsive killer, kills for a good purpose; to protect a marvellous invention from falling to the wrong hands. The innocent girl, played by Cameron Diaz, who by utter chance intersects with Roy Miller's bloody trail, matures in the process becoming less innocent and more adept in using survival skills in a tough world-to say the least.The bad guys, the obviously bad and the ones that turn to be bad despite first appearances are ably portrayed by the supporting actors. The sentimental aspects of the story are worked out, through the appearance of a young genius who is very simple-minded as far as the predicament that his genius has entangled him is concerned and a couple of old people that turn to be related to one of the main characters. Therefore the simpleton genius, for whom Roy Miller acts as a father/older brother figure and the couple of the elderly are the sole ""good"" persons in the movie. All the others implicated in the action have good and bad elements in their characters and the hero may be in the side of the ""light"" but kills so many people in the process that his morality becomes questionable to say the least.Humorous elements abound, in the flight sequence where Cameron Diaz's character has not realized the sort of person she has become entangled with and latter when the hero has to drug the girl in order to extricate her from difficult situations, when enemies surround them. In the end some fine lines are delivered when a reversal of roles has somehow been effected in the couple of leads.And one has to note that despite the fact that the movie targets the physical responses of human character, there is no sex except some kissing and some mild verbal innuendos.It is not a masterpiece but it is very pleasant to watch and the two main actors are very attractive human beings.",Knight and Day
150,Wililjam,Loved it,8,23 May 2012,"This movie do have lots of corny jokes, but it's great non the less. I loved it the first time I saw it, since I absolutely admire what Cruise and Diaz does in this movie and all the other movies they've been in. Tom Cruise plays the character Roy Miller who is, according to the CIA, an agent who went rogue who tries to steal the battery and sell it to some person of much important. June Havens is of course played by Cameron Diaz which is great in a ""blond jokes"" environment, she tells all those ""blond jokes"" and she does it with ""class"". She's a car restorer... restorer.. So she's on her way to the airport where Roy is smuggling the battery, that can run smaller cities or a submarine, through Junes traveling bag where she has parts of a engine or something. She finds herself on the airport, and Roy takes back the battery that he had hid. It's all like ""oh what a coincident"", then the action start and they get on the plane and Roy is all like ""Everything happens for a reason"" when June can't get on board the plane since there's ""no seat left"".

151,bjones,sufs,7,26 June 2010,"I want to inject a new word into the English language because I've seen it much displayed recently. SUFS; pronounced ""soofuss"". It means something in the entertainment world that has been ""set up for a sequel"". This film is a good example; but that doesn't offend when the item ""works"". This works.I expected some light summer entertainment and wasn't disappointed. I would have preferred seeing this in a different presentation, like B&W film noir, that would have made it even more fun. The story is a very well thought satirish thing that doesn't take itself too seriously. Examples abound but for easy examples, to me, was when the female lead - Cameron Diaz as June Haven - managed to coax about 400 rounds out of a 20 round magazine in an automatic weapon and the bit in riding reversed on a motorcycle; both were great.Speaking of Diaz, she did a pretty good job with what she was given, which was to portray a simple minded ""civilian"" caught up in amazing events. She had a few slow spots but nothing too distracting. She was funny as the frequently unconscious, unwilling victim.Tom Cruise as Roy Miller did a wonderful turn as the machine like, near-psychopathic spy. He seemed at his best when being the most ridiculous. He did the physical parts well and handled the silly dialog with a straight face so I guess I'd give him an A for the genre. He seems to be getting better as his roles edge closer to character types.Peter Sarsgaard, usually so stunning in what he does, is underfed script here so doesn't shine as much as one might expect, but he chews it well and doesn't offend in expectorating the resultant quiet type. What he does, he does extremely well. The unusual appearing Paul Dano as Simon Feck did nerds everywhere a service by not overdoing it while keeping up the charade.The only other two roles that caught my attention, were Viola Davis as Sarsgaard's boss, doing it while looking elegant and professionally competent. The other is not likely to go much noticed by anyone but me, it was the straight performance by Dale Dye in a role far removed from his usual exploits. It's nice to see a solid old Jarhead doing well . . . [; ) An honorable mention goes to the lady with the legs approaching Tom in a dark alley. We don't see her face but the legs are enough to be memorable. A short few frames later we see the stunning Israeli Gal Gadot, so the legs are supposed to be hers.You won't feel cheated seeing it; it might even be a fun night.Bruce L.

152,dudedazzreviews,Not bad...not bad at all. Better than Killers and The Bounty Hunter!,6,10 October 2010,"At first glance, Knight and Day seems like yet another predictable action-cross-romantic comedy with two of Hollywood's biggest nameswell, it is but there's more to it than meets the eye. The story doesn't really have any meaning to it or have any importance of some kind but it does the job of entertaining you and killing some time. So Knight and Day is about June, played by Diaz, whose life unexpectedly changes because of Roy, played by Cruise, who is being hunted down by the FBI because he's been suspected of going rogue. Add gunfights, explosions and round-the world chases to the mix and you have the best action-cross-romantic comedy movie of the summer. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz return on screen for the second time together since Vanilla Sky in Knight and Day which is nothing more than an entertaining action popcorn flick that's bound to make you smile even a little bit. Tom Cruise returns in top action form as rogue spy Roy and Cameron Diaz makes for some great entertaining viewing as June. The pair make a great and believable duo and the chemistry between Cruise and Diaz is what really makes this movie stand out from the other action-romcoms movies this year.Knight and Day isn't only funny but it also shows off some brilliant action scenes that will entertain and have you on the edge of your seat. While the movie doesn't really have character development or a solid plot, it works quite well as Diaz and Cruise make the movie with their characters. The movie is quite silly in some areas such as the scenes when June constantly gets drugged and some of the lines the characters say but it adds a certain charm to the movie so it's not a bad thing. The director, James Mangold who has directed movies such as 3:10 to Yuma, Walk The Line and Girl Interrupted, has done a great job in balancing the comedy with action and handles it superbly. The writing is good as it cleverly skips through the slow parts and starts before the action, which is done when Roy drugs June whenever she becomes a danger to herself. Also, the script can deliver some funny lines but there were times when it became a little tedious such as the FBI scenes. There are some laughs to be had in Knight and Day and it's pretty much for both action movie fans and romantic comedy fans.So Knight and Day is yet another action-cross-romantic movie Hollywood has offered lately, so let's look at the competition. We've had The Bounty Hunter, which starred Gerard Butler and Jennifer Aniston and we've had Killers, which starred Katherine Heigl and Ashton Kutcher. The Bounty Hunter is instantly forgettable as soon as it ends and Killers is just terrible so Knight and Day is easily the best out of them all as it was actually funny. There's a little something for everybody in this movie. Whether you like romance movies, action movies or comedy movies, you'll like Knight and Day.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",Knight and Day
153,TheAnimalMother,Perhaps the worst film of Cruise's entire career,2,2 February 2014,"After watching this film I'd like to rest my case that James Mangold is one of Hollywood's most overrated directors. Let's be honest, whether you like Tom Cruise or not, it is hard to deny that he has been a part of many entertaining films in his career. Well, let's not count this as one of them. They should have just made this story into a cartoon rather than a live action film because a silly cartoon is really all that this is. They could have just used the title of 'stupidity' and it would have fit here just as well. The film really isn't very funny, it's just dumb. We may as well just watch Tom Cruise do silly stunts for an hour and a half with someone doing marginal comic relief in the background and call it a movie. This is nearly complete garbage as far as I'm concerned, though I may have actually laughed two or three times.2.5/10",Knight and Day
154,jasontheterrible,Why this Tom Cruise Cameron Diaz Film Lost Money,6,17 April 2019,"You know how people on IMDB write: ""to enjoy this film you must turn your brain down to 3?"" Well for this film to keep your attention you cannot have a brain. So for all of you lucky, brainless people out there or kids under 13 this is a really good movie. Sizzling stars, tons of action and jaw dropping stunts. For the people with a brain out there, just when you get taken in by the story and the action you only have to wait 10 seconds for the director to go bananas with the most implausible, outrageous stunt or story-line shift. A million bad guys have them surrounded and are firing machine guns. Cruise decides to chat for awhile with foxy Diaz before firing back and killing them all and escaping. Believe it or not, pun intended, all of the scenes are like that. So you just have to imagine the actors and directors saying, ""we just want to be really crazy for the young kids, make everyone else laugh, give them great cinematography and get to the inevitable love connection. So guess what? On my fifth try of watching this over the years, I got it, had fun with it and enjoyed it. Now mind you I was able to get all of my household chores done at the same time, but hey, that is not all bad.",Knight and Day
155,d_art,"'Knight and Day' is a nutty, but fun, escapist action ride.",8,5 September 2010,"In the action spy thriller, Knight and Day, June Havens (Cameron Diaz) bumps into a stranger, Roy Miller (Tom Cruise), in the airport while en route to her sister's wedding. Roy appears to be a superspy who has a secret that everybody wants, and both of them find themselves dodging nefarious assassins and Federal agents all across the globe.Things start off with the strange and outrageous from the beginning of this film. A group of assassins have taken over an airplane to kill Roy, with June being the only civilian inside. An elaborate hand-to-knife combat scene ensues with Roy effortlessly killing all the bad guys (including the pilot who tried to shoot him) all the while June is in the restroom. Then, he calmly explains the situation to June as she comes out. Roy (who happens to know how to fly) winds up having to land the big plane in the middle of some field. It's established early on that this film isn't meant to be taken too seriously. The action is still quite fun, however.Upon looking at the trailer, one would think this film is mostly a romantic comedy with some action thrown in. Actually, it's more like an action flick with some comedy thrown in and maybe a small dash of romance. I would say this could be considered a very close cousin to True Lies and a second cousin of Mr. and Mrs. Smith. The humor and the outrageous action sequences borrow from our established understanding of spy action movie clichés. The action contains lots of stunts and has panache. For those familiar, I could also compare this film to a Japanese anime like Cowboy Bebop—it has that dry, dark, quirky humor to mix with the outrageous action—with slight nods to video games. Luckily, the tongue-in-cheek mayhem, lots of bullets, and stunt-filled, old-school action has more in common with True Lies than the silly CG-stuff of let's say, The A-Team. I could dig it.Tom Cruise is in fine form as Roy Miller, who is essentially a movie superspy (or our idea of it), who is quicker, more clever, alert, and quirkier than everyone else. He can get away from any trap, and beats people up real nicely, real quickly. He's not unlike Vincent, the amoral yet professional hit-man, from Collateral, mixed with an exaggerated invincibility of Ethan Hunt from Mission:Impossible and a dash of Cary Grant-type one-liners. Tom Cruise is extremely dedicated and precise with the action performances, seemingly doing many of his own stunts. Cameron Diaz plays the ""every-girl"" quite well as June Havens, who is along for the ride. For her, this is like a Meg Ryan-type role. The role doesn't really challenge her--she's likable, but plays mostly the straight person reacting to Roy's antics, although she has her fair moments of bullet-dodging and jumping. The relationship between Roy and June is strangely disturbing if you think about it, which makes for good dark humor. There is some chemistry and the dialogue between them amidst all the flying bullets is unexpected and playful.The plot isn't anything too complex. There's a scientific genius and some technology everybody wants (both of which Roy is hiding), with assassins everywhere. In planes, trains, automobiles, boats, and motorcycles, dodging bulls (in Spain) and bullets, one sees Roy and June escape these assassins all over the map with plenty of surrounding exotic scenery—Massachusetts, California, Jamaica, Austria, Spain, etc. It's silly, but the film is also partly an homage to old-fashioned spy thrillers, like Hitchcock's North By Northwest. The film doesn't have a problem relying on our knowledge of action flicks to fill in many of the gaps.Overall, I found this film to be a fun, escapist ride—and a well-done one. It's a fine summer flick. It doesn't pretend to be anything else, it's more clever than normal, and it's good at being...it. It pokes fun at itself and the genre without being too cheesy, as nothing here feels lazy--much effort has been put into the choreography and the look of the action scenes. It's nonstop and great to look at. Yes, it is light on romance. Tom Cruise's Roy is funny in a wacky and creepy way because he performs the ridiculous with a straight face. The dialogue is charming. It's good, nutty fun.You can also follow my more recent reviews on twitter.com/d_art",Knight and Day
156,montera_iulian,The action flick of the summer charged our batteries,6,26 July 2010,"Late late review... I know, but Knight and Day might be one of those movies that you know they suck but still manage to get your attention and entertain you to a certain level. I tried to compare this to the A Team. Where the A Team manages to win points Knight and Day loses and while I think I found Knight and Day more entertaining, the A Team was simply made better as far as execution goes.The storyline in Knight and Day is simple, cheesy but you kind of forget about what the movie is about since there is a lot of action that gets you pumped in the seat even if most of those scenes are hilarious and push limits that even Bond couldn't get out of those situations. With all that the dialogue was, in my opinion, well done offering some clicheic but funny moments. The acting helped a little bit the movie to not feel like a pain in the ass though I was expecting a little bit more from Javier Molla's character which was terribly handled. Remember him in Bad Boys 2?... That's how you build a character, that's how you shape it. Besides Javier Molla everyone done their job even if Cameron had some cheesy reactions.The execution of the movie was solid, few scenes were you could see the green screen in the back but they were short so I kinda forget about them, other than that what I really was disappointed especially in the first half of the movie was the soundtrack which didn't match the vibe the scenes had. It was poor inserted having nothing to do with the actual meaning of the scenes. After the first part it went on in a normal way but still it was ... ""meh""..After all should I say Cameron Diaz is still effin hot? And Tom Cruise still charming but I think he just can't pull a blockbuster role anymore. Just because he rides a bike and shows his abs doesn't mean he can pull another Mission Impossible. At the end of the day, Knight and Day did well to serve it's purpose and managed to keep some of us entertained. It's lucrative humor, hilarious action sequences and nice camera work around beautiful places seemed that kept me interested in the movie and made me give it a fresh review.",Knight and Day
157,ogdendc,Knight and Day? Cruise and Diaz. Warm and cute.,8,22 February 2013,"Knight and Day is basically a star vehicle. June Havens (Cameron Diaz) is your blonde ditzy heroine and Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) is your secret agent hero fighting rogue elements in his own agency.Roy Miller has the world's only perpetual energy source, named after a 1960s Ford for some reason, and everyone wants it I've a couple of problems. Why the title? It's OK, but doesn't relate to the film. Make the characters Roy Knight and June Day and it would have made sense. Also, should a romcom make you laugh out loud? This didn't. Diaz is cute, and there is some chemistry between the leads. But it's not really funny.However, it's the sort of film you can't really slate. That would be mean. Overall, it's a cute little action romcom spy movie and scores eight.",Knight and Day
158,Legendary_Badass,Mission: Ridiculous,6,23 June 2010,"Knight and Day isn't confusing or boring. It contains some good stunt work and has an occasionally witty line. The problem with Knight and Day is that it's a dime-a-dozen plot held back by its own lack of imagination.Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) is a special agent gone rogue. In an effort to flee Wichita, Kansas (trust me, everyone hear has tried this already) he swaps boarding passes with June (Cameron Diaz). The people trying to capture Roy clear June for her flight to Boston anyways, and she is caught in the crossfire that would have been her leisurely flight to Boston. Roy takes it upon himself to keep an eye on June while smuggling a much sought after eternally powered battery.What sounds like a simple plot isn't unveiled until two major action scenes into the film. This plot doesn't reveal itself; it has to be explained. When that explanation comes after tense action, there's little reason to care while observing the chaos. Roy kills people left and right, and the audience is in the dark over what we should be keeping an eye on or why we should care at all. Some of these scenes do look good. Tom Cruise is adamant about showing his famous facade while doing the stunts. Just like Mission: Impossible III, Tom takes a faithful leap off a building with an uncut perspective. I appreciate this stuntman approach; it aids me to see that a person is on the screen, let alone the star.Cruise gets every good line, leaving Diaz with little more than chances to repeat the obvious or gasp for air. Both are playing for laughs, but Cruise is more effective. These are two people functioning in the real world. CIA operates are trying to convince June to help bring in Roy with claims that he's losing his mind—a reasonable explanation for Tom to play Roy as demented. June's defining trait is that she's dumb enough to fly into Wichita for pony car exhaust tips. With all the technology on display, I assume the world of Knight and Day has eBay.The potential for Knight and Day may have been sealed by commercial limitations. Put two bankable stars into a summer movie action-comedy, then promote a promising director (James Mangold) to his biggest project, and you end up face to face with a computer readout of goals. The most likely route to reach these goals is through the PG-13 rating, and that's the path Knight and Day chooses. From there, things get lazy. The way the script recycles the POV narcoleptic condition to change surroundings gets old fast. The worst offense committed by Knight and Day is a shockingly convenient resolution. I don't make it a habit to knowingly dish out spoilers, but you'll feel stupid after seeing how the protagonist lucks- up. Call it Mission: Ridiculous.For Knight and Day, a negative counteracts each strength. Every good action set piece has its moment of obvious studio composite work; every good line ends up repeated to the point that it loses strength. There's certainly enough spectacle on hand to hold interest, but not enough to allocate a portion to the memory. With a brain on autopilot, tuned to receive the messages common with the espionage subgenre, the average viewer may have a decent time watching a rather average movie.",Knight and Day
159,blackmambamark,Pretty decent summer popcorn flick,7,23 June 2010,"Say what you will about Tom Cruise, but the boy can act. What? He's crazy because he believes in a religion that most don't follow, and he jumps on a couch on Oprah.....who cares. I like his movies. The day he starts picking stupid roles, and starts acting poorly, then i will jump on that band wagon. Until then, i'll keep seeing his pictures.The movie starts out pretty well. The combination of a romantic comedy and an action flick is done with the correct dosage. It knew when to be funny, it knew when to be romantic, and it knew when to cut all that off and throw you into the action. But as the movie went on, it slowly began to loose that perfect dosage.The second act started to loose me a bit. Mainly because it started leaning towards the romantic side and forgetting the other elements that make this an entertaining movie. Rather than have a romantic sequence followed by a funny skit or an action sequence, it was just a straight laced lovey dovey scene. Now i know most of the female audience will enjoy it.....but your male counterparts may find it a bit dull.But the third act kind of drops the ball. Tom Cruise who plays this funny, witty, and very professional action hero, starts to loose some of the traits that make him entertaining to watch. And i do not blame Mr. Cruise for this, i actually blame the writing. Because you can see on screen how confused Tom Cruise is. In these situations where he is suppose to suave and charismatic, like he was in 90% of the movie, he is now scared and confused.........needless to say, it felt a little out of place.Bottom Line.......it was a pretty good popcorn flick. The setup is really good, but i think that if they worked on the mechanics on the second and third act, it really could have been one of the summers better action movies. But i don't know if it was either trying to be that, or one of the summers best romantic comedies. Either way, the result leaves it as a decent action/romantic comedy.",Knight and Day
160,treeskier802,Perhaps Cruise's Worst Movie,2,12 December 2011,"Certainly a lot of controversy surrounds Tom Cruise. Some like him, some respect him as an actor, but many voice their hatred of him. I've always considered Cruise to be a good actor with great screen presence. While he is in some really great films such as Rain Man and A Few Good Men, he often is in films that may not be great, but at least are quite good such as Valkyrie, Mission Impossible, and Jerry Maguire. Knight and Day simply stunk. The writing was horrible. Why Cruise would want to take on this project after reading the screenplay to this disaster is beyond me. Even an actress like Cameron Diaz, (who I see as a star who is not much of an actress), surprises me as to why she would want to be involved in such a poor film. This movie had nothing going for it whatsoever. Paul Dano, who is a good young actor was basically picking up a paycheck. His talents were wasted in this film. The story was bland at best, the acting was dialed in, and the direction basically just got done; there wasn't much the director could do but to get the movie completed. I honestly do not know who this movie would appeal to. If it was supposed to be a comedy, it wasn't funny. If it was supposed to be an action movie, there were no sequences that really wowed you or that have not been done before.

It zips along from locale to locale, keeping you chuckling with its occasional good humor, if rarely laughing out loud or finding it particularly witty. At its best, some of the editing is quite expressive (especially when representing Cameron Diaz' flickering consciousness after she's been drugged), giving the film the feel of a movie of higher pedigree than you might otherwise expect from such a mid-summer diversion.The thing is, you've seen it all before, and you've seen Tom Cruise do it all before, and in fact, as you are watching it, you begin to feel that you've seen Tom Cruise do it all before in every single movie you've ever seen him in. That ultimately Mission Impossible is every bit as much of a farce as Knight and Day, and that his characters in those ""serious"" action movies are not a bit more believable or interesting than the one presented here, in glorious two-dimensionality. You think, maybe they should pass out 2D glasses before you see a Tom Cruise movie, to make sure that nothing ever pokes out as too realistic and jarring. Because that's the kind of movies he's good at, and that's what we pay for when we go see one of them: we pay to be reassured that nothing will ever rise above the level of entertaining into the realm of the thoughtful or the disturbing.Of course this isn't very fair. Tom Cruise has been in a number of interesting movies over the years. He was in Stanley Kubrick's last, strange effort. He had that crazy role in Magnolia, playing some sort of manic control-freak guru leading a self-help movement that exploited people's weak-mindedness. (Talk about a stretch!). But, being fair aside, I think we all know what I mean when I say, Tom Cruise just makes the same movie over and over again, and we pay the same ten, errr, thirteen dollars, over and over again, to feel the same weird kind of comfortable we feel seeing him be shallow, attractive, narcissistic, assertive, and completely inscrutable. That's just the way it is.",Knight and Day
168,TC-Batsy,Knight and Day is Fantastic,10,17 September 2012,"As a fan of the Mission Impossible movies, I really loved Knight and Day which combined the elements of a spy thriller and a romantic comedy into a terrific movie. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz's chemistry reflected their outstanding performance since Vanilla Sky, and they did an amazing job together as Roy and June. Tom Cruise still excels in comedy, he hasn't lost his unique charisma and ability to do his own stunts. Cameron was funny and convincing as the clueless girl who finds herself in the most awkward situations with a spy. The people who didn't like this film don't know how to appreciate a good movie that can make you laugh and entertain you. I give Knight and Day 10 stars. Well done Tom and Cameron!",Knight and Day
169,ad_upclose,"Fun, silly...but more fun!",8,26 June 2010,"Fun, silly, fun, silly...that pretty much sums up the movie for me. If it was not for Cruise, this movie would have been a disaster, but he saves it with his charisma, pulling off a very enjoyable character. Cruise fans will not be disappointed.The action and some of the sequences are downright silly/mindless; reminded me of Shoot em Up (but Knight is a better movie overall). Mangold would have produced a significantly better movie had he prolonged some of the serious scenes of the movie, but that is not the direction he wanted to go with it; he just wanted it fast and light on emotion. I liked how he directed the traveling sequences, leaving almost all of it to the imagination.As mentioned earlier Cruise is fantastic and one cant help anticipate what he will do next with his crazy character. I felt his chemistry with Diaz was good; she pulled off her role nicely as well.Overall, if you can switch off your brain for a few scenes and are a fan of Tom Cruise, this is an entertaining summer flick.",Knight and Day
170,amraampk,quite enjoyable to me,8,8 July 2010,"i happened to watch its premier show here in my native Lahore in a nearest theater and i wasn't disappointed. Tom cruise from very beginning is my favorite hero , and again his appearance in this fun packed action thriller was quite impressive. The more thing was good on screen chemistry between tom and Cameron diaz with humor. Both have re teamed after their part in vanilla sky. I liked its fight sequences very much , Tom cruise being an under cover secret agent and his accidental patch up with Cameron diaz who was just traveling in the airplane to attend her little sis wedding. Movie although little bit falls short of mission impossible 3 but it really has its good moments and occasions worth to enjoy.",Knight and Day
171,TheUnseenMovieLover,"Two terrific stars, one lacklustre movie",5,28 August 2010,"Knight and Day stars Tom Cruise as Roy Miller, a mysterious man who meets normal girl June Havens (Cameron Diaz) at Wichita airport. She's flying home for her sister's (Maggie Grace) wedding; he's fleeing from someone. On their flight, Roy kills everyone except June, then crashes the plane and drugs June. After waking up at her home, June tries to carry on as normal, but is apprehended by CIA agents led by Fitzergerald (Peter Saarsguard). They tell June that Roy is a dangerous rogue agent, but they're not exactly lovable heroes, either. So when Roy abruptly bursts back into her life, June makes a split decision to trust him. Cue a plot involving a perpetual battery and its inventor (Paul Dano), a Spanish arms dealer (Jordi Molla) and Roy's past This is essentially a star vehicle for Cruise and Diaz, and if you only looked at these two actors, the movie succeeds. Cruise wonderfully mocks his action hero persona with charm and warmth; it's the most fun he's had in a performance for a long time. Diaz doesn't get as much to do as Cruise, and her character's back-story is trite and manufactured, but she plays her role with such goofball enthusiasm that you're immediately won over. Alas, Roy and June's budding romance isn't given time to breathe amongst the action sequences and the unnecessarily over-stuffed plot. If a few of these plot threads and some of the action sequences had been left on the cutting room floor (such as a rooftop chase which unwisely tries to copy The Bourne Ultimatum) and if more time was spent on Roy and June's relationship, the payoff would have more impact. If the supporting characters aren't going to get anything of substance to do, it would have been better for them to have been cut from the movie too. Grace, Marc Blucas (as June's ex), Molla and Viola Davis (as Roy's superior) all try their best, but they are laboured by characters so undernourished and so inconsequential that the existence of Knight and Day as a star vehicle for Cruise and Diaz seems more of a curse than a blessing. The only two supporting actors who make an impression are Dano, both funny and convincingly scared, and Saarsguard, who pulls off his sinister role with ease, and even these two are struggling with wafer-thin roles.With brilliant and memorable titles to his credits such as Identity, Walk The Line and 2007's 3:10 To Yuma, James Mangold is an impressively skilled director. You wouldn't know it from Knight and Day. Mangold seems to have a checklist; Two movie stars? Check. Lots of exotic locations? Check. Plenty of action? Check. Some comedy? Check. It's a shame he didn't ground his story more in character and romance than in action. I was very rarely thrilled or compelled to find out what happens to Roy and June, and given that Cruise and Diaz are incredibly likable here, that's saying something. From the midway point, I was fighting the urge to do something that I very rarely do, and another thing which I have never done. Firstly, I wanted to check the time on my phone, something which a disconcerting number of people in the screening were doing in the last 45 minutes or so. Secondly, I wanted to actually get up and walk out. I mean actually walk out of the cinema and go home. It is rare for me to have this feeling about a movie, and that's why alarm bells were ringing in my head.Some of the comedy is effective. Cruise's indestructible buoyancy has some very funny results, whereas Diaz gets some opportunity to show her comic charm in scenes such as one where she is injected with a truth serum. The locations are gorgeous; the flitting between different places is something I've always liked about spy movies, even though the movie flies too fast from one location to the next that we're never given the chance to appreciate one location's beauty or sense of character. There are also some effective action scenes, even though they are sometimes stilted by sub-par visual effects. If I had to applaud the action sequences for one thing, it would be that the shaky camera is nowhere to be found. The first fight scene between Roy and CIA agents on the plane is exciting and funny. A later car chase where June and Roy try to escape gun-happy agents on the highway is also fun, whilst there is a close-quarters knife fight on a train with an unexpected climax. This is followed by a long, notably dull patch, after which the filmmakers apparently wake up and deliver the film's best action sequence, a swerving, quick but never confusing chase through the streets of Sevilla, Spain. I'll give you one clue; it involves bulls.There are two bona fide stars in this movie. But, as my dad said, ""people will see this movie because of the two stars, regardless of the quality"". Some of the action and comedy hits the mark, whilst I can't fault Cruise or Diaz. But there is too much going on, and this is a movie which should be light on its feet, not lumbering and uncertain. Half the supporting cast and subplots could have been dumped without considerable damage and would have improved the movie immensely. As it is, I just couldn't connect. The ending, for me, was very unsatisfying, and there was no emotional payoff from the subplot involving Roy's past, just an ineffective punch line. Maybe I'm being too harsh. I'm normally a generous guy, and I very rarely hate a movie. But I just didn't like Knight and Day. Take that as you will; I know a lot of people who liked the movie, and a lot of people who probably will like the movie. But for me, it didn't work.",Knight and Day

173,zterrell,A pleasant surprise,9,25 June 2010,"OK, so I give it 9 of 10 stars. Not because it equals the best movie ever, but because it is a fun ride. Critics who bashed this were maybe looking for something deeper than sheer entertainment. You want drama or profound characters with deep emotional scars...then look elsewhere. But if you want a thrill ride with great stunts and some very funny exchanges, this is worth your time. If you liked ""Get Smart"" then you will probably enjoy this film. My only wish is that I hadn't seen a couple previews. They gave away some of the best shots...though they work much better once you grasp the context. This is only the forth film I've been to this year, due to the low quality of movies...and directors like Greengrass who ruin action films with hand-held cameras. Refreshingly, you were allowed to see all of the top-notch stunts without getting a headache or sick to your stomach with this one. Great date movie...it's a classic throwback to a time when there was less gore, bathroom humor or crass language (although there was a single F word, just so you would know this was released in the era where no one in Hollywood can speak without using foul language at least once).",Knight and Day
174,drklabs,Fake teeth for everyone !!!,6,21 September 2010,"There are so many people that have written reviews for this film so i think all opinions have been told , but i'll try to add some interesting things after my evaluation , my opinion is that this film misses some important things that make a great movie but generally worth's its pop corn.Most interesting part was inside the big airplane at start in my opinion this was the whole movie for me if you ask me, after this point and before that point it was pointless really like a dead end like a Chinese man with strait eyes, i wont say more things about this scene not to add any spoilers .A lot of scenes was without interest at all after this scene i ll give an example who cares about the secret house of the spy's parents !!!!not funny at all, so the movie had the absence of a nice plot in fact i think that there was no plot at all ,it was only some parts from action movies reconstructed as separate parts of this movie and connected to a main idea that was to produce some fun and excitement.Most stupid scene of the film was the scene in Austrian hotel also the turn that took the plot with the guy who at start was the good guy and finally was the not so Innocent guy (how prototype loll) I wanted to write some more words but it really didn't produced any great feelings for me so The film after the start was really below mediocre.Diaz and Cruze was sympathetic a lot and in some times gave a little fun to audience and for the girl diaz i really think that has great potentialities but till now i haven't watched her to a nice plot that can give her best self always plays in mediocre comedies and stupid plots like ""The Box"". The film had some kick ass action and some fun and my opinion is too much money spended for nothing.The most important tool that was missing from this movie to make it really interesting and entertainable with such big stars of cinema was the vibrator...if this movie was completed with this instrument i could really gave it a 10 but now it takes my 6/10",Knight and Day
175,pandrews2104,Such an Underrated Film!,10,8 May 2020,"This is the perfect action-comedy. You have two of the most charismatic leads in Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz and a script and direction that breezes along. It reminds me of classic films like Romancing the Stone with romance, spy craft and chemistry at 11. It is such a breezy action comedy that if it had been made years ago, it would have starred Cary Grant and Hepburn.",Knight and Day
176,YourFamilyExpert,"Weaknesses made up for by stunts, laughs, chemistry",7,17 January 2017,"Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz star in this romantic action-comedy about an unfailingly polite (and somewhat crazy) spy and the girl next door he falls for. No matter your opinion on Tom Cruise, he is a hoot here as he spoofs his own ""invincible action hero"" screen image as well as his own eccentric real-life persona. In no other film has he made me laugh so hard. Diaz, for her part, evolves slowly from damsel-in-distress to a strong and courageous action heroine, and she is a surprisingly good comic and romantic foil for Cruise. Their chemistry, terrific action sequences, and very funny dialogue carry the film over its rather formulaic plot, some slow patches, and wide gaps in the narrative. Knight and Day is a great date movie for those looking for a balance of laughs, thrills, and romance. Audiences should know that there is brief strong language, a couple of innuendos (and the stars briefly appear in swimwear), and a good deal of violence, though the tone of the latter is so over-the-top that it is clearly dark humor and parody of the ridiculousness of ""invincible action-hero"" movies. Still, those troubled by any of the above should look elsewhere.",Knight and Day

They very soon form an unlikely team once they discover that the only ones that they can trust are each other.The FBI / CIA and several bad gangs and governments are all after the permanently re-generating power source – that is in Roy Miller's possession and would do anything (including bumping off their own man) to get it! Lot's of cool action scenes and stunts interspersed with some great comedy one-liners and visual gags (especially funny is the ""truth drug"" scene)  The very assured, able direction is by James Mangold (Cop Land, Walk the Line, Girl Interrupted) – who seems to revel in these high-octane adventure movies. The film is well paced and the story works with many twists and turns that should keep everyone interested.The thing that normally makes or breaks these type of movies is the chemistry between the main leads – and in this film it works really well as I think that this film is a vehicle made for Cruise and Diaz – and they excel in these type of roles.I think that KNIGHT AND DAY will be a very successful movie and I wouldn't be surprised if there were sequels to come.A great KNIGHT out  that'll make your DAY!",Knight and Day

179,patherwill,The leads didn't gel well!,3,25 October 2013,"I know this was billed as a Comedy/Drama and I went into it with an open mind because I really DON'T think Tome Cruise does comedy well BUT I thought 'Heck, let's give the guy a break and see?' Unfortunately my first instincts were right and unfortunately again in MY mind at least he was pitted-up-against someone who I personally think ISN'T very funny or maybe it's just the material she gets? Either way it seemed to me that the two of them made hard work of it all with Diaz playing what has become her usual 'ditzy' bimbo role - POSSIBLE SPOILER - When she lets loose with the Kalashnikov or whatever in the factory when Cruise and her go to see his friend, played by Paul Dano - SO OLD HAT NOW. OK THEY get to travel to a fair few places on the Globe, there is a 'basis of a story' there IF you can follow it BUT it's really a bit of a mess and hard work.He's done some very good work in my opinion - A Few Good Men springs to mind but I think he should stick to straight roles.",Knight and Day
180,mike_brunton,A great summer flick - Cruise and Diaz deliver.,8,26 June 2010,"I ordinarily lean toward the horror genre for my thrills, but one downside to that is the usual atrocious budgets horror movie directors have to carry out their visions. The Crazies was an example of what a good budget can do for a horror movie. I am sure Knight and Day had a gazillion bucks budget, although I am also sure that the days of ol' Tom commanding a $50 million dollar fee for his fine acting are long gone. Similar to Stallone -he reached his peak (arrogance) and has come somewhat back to earth. I loved Tom in Tropic Thunder - mainly because I didn't even know it was Tom, so the blue eyed son can act. Here Diaz and him have a reasonable believable chemistry as they evade baddies left, right and center. The movie reminded me of a comic book at times, the preposterous situations, the hundreds of bullets that didn't find their mark.... Mangold created two likable characters so you find yourself rooting for them both and enjoying their seeming imperviousness to small metal projectiles traveling at 500 kph. The story was not new, the action scenes had been done before, the locations were as expected but for example if Daniel Craig had played out this movie in the form of 007, many people could have come away thinking it was better than Quantum of Solace (a movie that disappointed me). Overall, an excellent return to the big screen for Mr Cruise, Diaz also continues to be an impressively attractive female lead, quite a feat - I still remember her in the Mask from what? 20 years ago? Smokin' !! Go with your better half, you will not be disappointed.",Knight and Day
181,thesubstream,Dumb but honest. Like a golden retriever covered in ketchup,4,25 June 2010,"Cameron Diaz does what she can with what little she's given to work with in James Mangold's brainless, hyperactive and utterly rote spy-romance-thriller Knight and Day. Paired with the increasingly wooden, increasingly off-putting Tom Cruise as half of a pair of mis-matched adventurers on the run with a valuable MacGuffin fighting off arms dealers and CIA agents alike, she seems to be the only one in the flick that's got a half-inch worth of ambition.Diaz is asked to play one of those uniquely stupid Hollywood-committee takes on a modernized cute-woman-in-peril-who-learns-to-handle-her-own-uzis, a tough-talking Bostonian who raised her younger sister and is totally girly, and cute, and goofy, and likes boys, but wears boots (!!) and fixes up muscle cars (!!). Cruise plays agent Roy Miller, the agent gone rogue who swoops into her life and together, they have a series of absolutely predictable kung-fu & fireball escapades across a series of scenic European rooftops.Knight and Day attempts to enliven its muddled, characterless story by kicking things off with the zenithal version of one of the tiredest Hollywood tropes - characters ""meeting cute"" - and it succeeds well enough in its early stages, where Diaz is allowed to stretch her cute-chops talking to herself in an airplane bathroom while Cruise's Miller wreaks havoc outside.It's all downhill from there, though, as Cruise robotically manufactures a performance that at best is reminiscent of the cocky, aggressive charm he could exude in decades past. The film trades in its early attempts at characterization for repeated slapstick gags and hard to follow plot twists, all of which it then tries to paper over with breathless action and hokey romance.To be fair, the film doesn't shoot very high. It wears its low-brow goofiness right there on its sleeve, and it mostly achieves its goal of being a light-hearted, dumb as a rock summer action movie, which is more entirely than can be said for, say, Ashton Kutchers' repellent Killers. See it in a good mood with low expectations and you might be well enough convinced that it's light rather than stupid, fun rather than ridiculous, charming and cute rather than manufactured and plastic. That last part is probably a stretch though. 4/10",Knight and Day

The movie wanted to be an action comedy like R.E.D. but it's not, thin line between plausible and absurd scenes is heavily crossed. Because the main character is just indestructible, falling from bridges, trains, cars and not a scratch. To him, Brus Willis in Die Hard looks like a baby. Romance between him and Cameron's character, where she is a damsel in distress, reminded me of the cartoon Beauty and the Beast. But there is just no chemistry between them at all, and they keep chasing each other for an entire movie.

Not quite as much action and gizmos as your standard Bond flick but more romance between the two, but not as much romance as moonlighting.I would consider it a great date night movie, not overloaded with the typical romcom story line but enough to keep those who enjoy romance movies itch scratched with enough action and adventure to keep most Stallone or Schwarzenegger fans happy.",Knight and Day

Didn't anybody learn from the previously failed pairing of the worst actress on the modern so-called ""A-List,"" with the all time clown prince of acting ineptitude (in Vanilla Sky)? Insanity is the only explanation for repeating a blunder of that magnitude, and expecting a different result. Diaz and Cruise spark neither comic nor romantic chemistry, only questions as to why this movie was even made. Fittingly, the scripting is as abominable as the leads are. It's a screwball romance/over-the-top spy adventure. Doesn't that sound incredibly original and promising? How about that astonishingly brilliant and inspired title? Let's pause a moment to enjoy an uncontrollable fit of laughter. It's even worse than you'd expect, though. Tom's playing his own uninteresting self as usual, precisely what nobody wants to see. Meanwhile, Diaz just seems to be posed like a broken Barby doll: her character is literally unconscious half the time, a source for more improbable and unfunny plot contrivances. When she is awake, she giggles nervously and stupidly. She rides shotgun with Tom on various vehicles while he shoots bad guys that for some reason don't hit anything they shoot at. The lowest point of this trash heap is when Ton and Diaz are on a motorcycle, making poorly written quips and one-liners while he kills everybody in sight. Hilarious.

Cruise plays a crazy guy not too unlike his real self, which keeps you constantly guessing who his character truly is. The humor is EXTREMELY well timed, and well written. The action is admirably sequenced. The direction and cinematography are consistently one step ahead of the viewer's expectations - there are moments where you think it's being poorly portrayed, only to be surprised.

189,faisal_khatib,"In the end, I honestly regret going for this movie in the theatre.",3,7 July 2010,"A movie that is trying to be a comedy and an action movie at the same time can go wrong in a lot of ways and unfortunately 'Knight and Day' was one of those movies that went horribly wrong in almost every possible way. Directed by James Mangold whose last directional venture was '3:10 to Yuma' (a movie I liked a lot), it was disappointed to see this quality of work coming from him.The problem does not lie with the concept which revolves around a secret agent Roy Miller (played by Tom Cruise) who's being hunted by his own agency because they believe he has gone rogue while he tries to clear his name, James bond style. His love interest is played by the completely ordinary June Havens (played by Cameron Diaz) whose character revolves around being the damsel in distress who gets saved by Roy Miller every single time. Now this has been done a million times over and can still be successful on an average level if executed well which is surely not the case here.The problem with 'Knight and Day' is the lead cast. Tom Cruise is old, and just because he manages to extract some abs out of his tummy at this age does not change the fact that watching him doing stunts that you would expect a much younger actor to do is a little implausible. Cameron Diaz on the other hand looked older than she has in any other movie that I've seen of hers and very tired. I don't know if it was the makeup or the lack of it but it does remove the slight quirky edge out of her character. Then there was the chemistry. It was hard to watch them romance each other in ways you'd expect 20 something people to do. It was mid life crisis on the big screen or something along those lines and it didn't look good.And then there was the feeling that this was just Mission Impossible 4 for Tom Cruise with a bit of comedy thrown in it. Mission Impossible 3 was bad enough, this one just felt worse. Also the lack of any substantial support characters didn't help either nor did the jokes that fell flat most of the time and just got half hearted laughs from most the crowd. Even the CGI was poorly done.The only saving grace was some of the action was nicely executed while Tom Cruise was good in patches. Even Cameron Diaz managed to save some face at the end when she managed to play the part of being drugged by a truth serum convincingly.In the end, I honestly regret going for this movie in the theatre.",Knight and Day
190,Apemangalore,An initially entertaining film that takes a tremendous nose dive in the latter half,4,26 June 2010,"Based on the trailers for Knight and Day, I expected a fairly middle-of-the-road summer flick. If nothing else, I thought, having Tom Cruise back to doing what he does best in the action-hero role would warrant a viewing. Having just finished seeing it, though, I feel almost as though I should be reviewing two separate films.The first half of this movie promises a solid, fun experience due primarily to the banter between Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz's characters. Initially, these two have terrific on-screen chemistry, with several scenes between the two of them being absolutely hilarious. It's the perfect marriage of action and comedy, and all seems to be going smoothly.About mid-way through the film, however, it completely switches gears and becomes this lazy, meandering, worn out mess of an action film. The witty banter between Cruise and Diaz feels lost, and the movie almost seems to go out of its way to show as little action as possible. Specifically, there are several sequences in which the duo is in peril, and rather than showing us, the audience, how this conflict was resolved, we see one of the two characters get knocked out, followed by them awaking in a safe and secure location. It's these moments in particular that make the second half of this movie frustrating, and this is all on top of a story that ends up being not the least bit engaging.Even the action that actually is present in Knight and Day, though, is hit-or-miss. The few action scenes found in the initial half are solid, with well-choreographed stunts, as well as the aforementioned dialogue between the two leads, which serve to enhance the fun factor of each sequence. However, as with every other aspect of the film, the action found in the second half isn't nearly as entertaining, and as often as John Powell's (the Bourne trilogy, Bolt) musical score attempts to liven the scene up, it all just feels like old hat.Knight and Day is a film that, despite its initial promise of a simple, fun action flick, takes a tremendous nose dive about mid-way through the experience. Ultimately, it's just another addition to the list of mediocre action films in a summer that's, thus far, been virtually full of them.",Knight and Day
191,cybersupam,Just like Mission Impossible-4,7,14 July 2010,"After seeing the high-definition trailer of Knight and Day in Youtube I was crazily waiting for it's release, and I vowed to catch it only in theater. I was totally impressed by the trailer, and the kind of storyline of which usually I'm a regular watcher. This is undoubtedly my type of movie - in which a spy and something mystery is involved.Finally, after it released I watched it today. I enjoyed it perfectly with its twisted turns and fast paced actions and comedies. The stunts performed with touch of CGI are great and entertaining. But for sure, to watch all the stunt scenes we need to keep our brain-logic aside for two hours, and we can never find out the logic of why 'a hero is always best'. After a successful Mission Impossible-3 (2006) Tom Cruise returned with a hard core action thriller, mixed with romantic comedies. In my judgment, the stunts and action angles carried out here are much improved and interesting than his Mission Impossible series.The storyline is simple and straight forward with common happenings - a man meets a woman and slowly something starts to happen between them. Cruise plays as secret agent Roy Miller who is skilled in delivering timely duties to his mission. In the beginning his role seems to be in dark side but with dangerous purpose, but slowly the real facts appear. He always follow June (Cameron Diaz)for unknown purposes, and protects her from goons. But there is always something as a reason behind these happenings. After interval we get to know the real identity of Roy Miller with short background.Cruise is perfect enough to opt for this kind of heroic roles, and entertain his fans. His fans would certainly enjoy with this male dominated movie. Cameron has lesser parts to show, other than her feminine characteristics. Certainly, so far, this is my favorite movie starred by Cameron Diaz. She appears terrifically hot and smart in her role with Cruise - much improved than in Vanilla Sky. But I think we could have seen hotter scenes between the 2 stars, as they have a sizzling chemistry.After 3:10 to Yuma, a western classical, James Mangold is back with this contemporary action thriller. His masterpiece Walk the Line or Identity are also memorable.At last, Knight and Day is not a masterpiece but definitely worth a watch, and entertaining till the end. Hope to see Cruise and Cameron come back together again.",Knight and Day
192,TonyHurtado,"Knight and Day, was OK",6,5 December 2010,"Well to start off I knew the critics weren't going to go for this film. Either because Tom Cruise was in it or they just didn't like it. Now when I say ""because of Tom Cruise"" I am not implying that Cruise is a bad actor I'm saying it because allot of people aren't fond of Tom Cruise. I personally think hes a great actor but just had a mini freak out during 2007. But, getting back to the movie, it's a very fast paced action flick that can be enjoyed by all. It also has a great taste of comedy in the film. Although I think the story line happened to fast throughout the film. I felt the two main characters met to quickly. Besides that I also liked that through the movie you can never really tell if Tom Cruise's character is a good or bad guy. To sum up i give this movie a straight 5 out of 10 stars for this film.",Knight and Day
193,ungy357,"Not great, but solid fun",7,17 June 2010,"Knight and Day"" is a comfort food movie. It's a pleasant diversion, a fun time at the cinema that doesn't ask a lot of of it's audience and offers an enjoyable ride. We've seen it all before, but it worked pretty well then, and it works pretty well now.June Havens (Cameron Diaz) is an average perky blonde romantic comedy heroine who runs into the charming and mysterious Roy Miller (Tom Cruise) at the airport, and is sucked into a series of misadventures when Roy turns out to be a secret agent fighting rogue elements in his own agency . . . or maybe HE's the rogue agent . . . It depends on who she listens to. there's a mysterious device called the Zephyr that Roy is either protecting or trying to steal. All of this is fairly predictable, and, again, nothing new. But director James Mangold (""Copland"", ""Walk the Line"", ""3:10 to Yuma"") always knows how to make a film play, and his skills haven't deserted him here. His pacing is brisk and fun, and he stages some terrific action (including one sequence from Diaz' point of view that did feel genuinely new).Of course, this is a star vehicle, and whether you enjoy it will depend a lot on how you feel about Tom Cruise. Dismissing his personal life as utterly irrelevant, I find him to be a solid and dependable actor who does action better than almost anyone in Hollywood. And, here, he gets a rare chance to flex his comic muscles, and hie's quite funny (though too much of the best material is in the trailer). Diaz is pleasant, but tries a little too hard to be cute. And, occasionally, the film itself has the same problem.But, overall, it's a funny little spy movie. part adventure, part romcom. Not destined for any Ten Best Lists, but enjoyable summer entertainment.",Knight and Day
194,gundognc,It's a rom-bomb-com!,5,4 September 2010,"While it is hardly high art, Knight & Day is a moderately entertaining bit of fluff. It's clearly been cynically designed to be film that men and women can both enjoy. The problem is that while you can make a good romantic comedy (there must be at least one, I suppose) and you can make a good comic thriller I think that a good romantic comedy thriller may be impossible. The elements are too disparate.Tom ""Bonzo Loony McInsaneypants"" Cruise is his usual charming self and runs a good level of manic energy. I'd seen the trailer a few times and in typical Hollywood fashion it ruined just about all the best lines of the film. The moment where Cruise says ""If anyone tries to stop me I'll kill myself and then her"" should have been hilarious but having seen it in so many trailers it just seemed tired. The word ""kooky"" could have been invented for Cameron Diaz and she is very charming in the film. Her transition from humble classic car restorer to international secret agent seems a bit unlikely but then so is this film so why not.SpoilerJune (Diaz) gets onto a plane with Roy Miller (Cruise) and ""wacky"" violence ensues. Whilst June's in the kharzi Miller kills everyone on the plane and crashes it in a field. Miller, you see, has absconded with a super-top-secret AA battery which can power a city. The US government want it back and think that Miller may have handed it off to June which puts her in the frame as well.This kicks off a global chase much of which occurs offscreen whilst June, drugged by Miller, is unconscious. End SpoilerIn the end Knight & Day is a compromise film. It's designed to be a good date movie. It has some crash-bang-wallop for the guys, some swoony-smoochy to keep the ladies interested and a bit of comedy to round it all off. All told it was moderately entertaining and for what it is designed to do it does fine. If you want to see a good film starring either Cameron Diaz or Tom Cruise there are better alternatives.",Knight and Day
195,martys-7,Awful Crap Apparently Written by a 10-Year-Old Boy,2,7 January 2011,"I gave two stars. One star for a couple of mildly amusing action or comic scenes, like Cameron Diaz asking Tom Cruise how come she is now wearing a bikini after been drugged. Another for a few scenes in Salzburg and Seville, including a bull race.The movie is total spy thriller nonsense as if scripted by a 10-year-old who spent time in Europe and saw a couple of the Bourne and Bond films. Not only we are asked to suspend all disbelief, we are asked not to think anymore. CIA agents take over entire commercial flights substituting airline personnel, a plane crashes and there is no federal investigation, passports do not exist, bullet wounds heal by themselves, airplanes and cars manifest out of nowhere, a lower middle class garage owner can take off traveling forever without worrying about bills or money; she is kidnapped right in front of everybody and her family does not looks for her, etc.Worse of it, Diaz and Cruise have ZERO chemistry: the are TWO BIG FAKES like everything else in the movie.A movie for morons and a total waste of time.",Knight and Day
196,billpappas-1,I must be psychic,1,17 September 2010,"First. I don't go to the movies any more, just what's on HBO or TCM, so I'm not speaking as a movie connoisseur. But, I like to check out if my initial impressions are accurate when movies come out from the previews, appearance on late night shows by the stars promoting them and even a 'making of XYZ' documentary as soon as the movie is released. When this came out and I saw the previews plus Cruise and Diaz on The Tonight Show hyping it, especially Cruise's fixation on the motorcycle scene with Diaz as though that was the highlight of the movie, I thought, 'no pass'. As I write this on 9/17/10, the gross hasn't reached the cost of the budget yet. And many reviews claim it's the worst movie ever. Second. Here's my problem. Two of may favorite movies, 'A Few Good Men' and 'The Firm' star Cruise, who was pretty good in them even though I didn't care for him when he first started and even less so the last few 'post Oprah's couch' years. Those 2 movies had great, interesting stories, good casts and were well made in all the ways that make for good movies; production values, soundtrack, editing etc. It's like someone actually cared about the product. They didn't occur to me as just money making ventures like this mess. The movie business is kind of mysterious. I wonder if Kevin Costner will ever get funding for another 'bomb at the box-office'. I guess Cruise will get a few more chances but it's full of pitfalls. He may try to compensate by making something really 'significant' or something even more stupendous and expensive with a lot of special effects. Why not simply make a good movie with a good story, characters and cast?",Knight and Day
197,TheBkMogul,Cruise is in good form.,7,7 August 2010,"I enjoyed this a lot more than I would, and that's because of Tom Cruise. It's a shame he's getting a bad rap recently, because his comedic timing and subtle tone are pitch perfect. Diaz plays the ditzy role a little too well, becoming more of an annoyance than a worthwhile companion, although she has a nice sequence towards the end with Cruise on a motorcycle.The plot is....well, who cares about that. It's all about moving from exotic location to another. It moves along nicely, without dwelling on anything deep, because once again, the focus is on Cruise who's great at delivering deadpan lines and kicking ass. It proves just how multi-talented he is. Hopefully, America will get re-acquainted with him because he's still got ""it"".",Knight and Day
198,Abir-Xtreme,I regret buying this movie!,4,5 May 2011,"When Knight and Day was Released it created such a hype i thought i must see this movie, hoping to get a decent action comedy flick i bought the movie. So i push the disc in and start watching the movie, after 109 minutes of of unimaginable disappointment, i just felt sad for the money i wasted for this weird film, For Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz this movie was just about having a good paycheck and having some fun along the way. The Movie is Plain garbage, From the Direction to the acting to special effects, it's all waste of money! so if you expect anything good from this movie, than i strongly suggest you avoid watching this movie. As it will do nothing but waste your time and money. Now those of who are blind fan's of Tom cruise or Cameron Diaz may dislike my thought's, but than again, i am just telling the truth",Knight and Day
199,shroyertour,Best - Excellent - definitely would watch it anytime,10,2 November 2010,"There is a (very) short list of Hollywood guys who are just too cool for school. Clint Eastwood, no matter how old he is; Bruce Willis, no matter how short he is; Brad Pitt, so many different and well done roles; and Tom Cruise, short too but who cares.And ever since ""There's Something About Mary"" I decided there's something about Cameron Diaz. She is not just beautiful, she is interesting. Just look into those stunning, sparkling eyes in a close-up to see what I mean.Cruise and Diaz combine for this action/spy/suspense/comedy/romance and they make it work brilliantly. Cruise is a super-spy returning from a mission who realizes that he was not supposed to survive. Diaz is the restorer of antique muscle cars who Cruise ""bumps into"" (twice) at the airport.Events quickly unfold to make clear that Cruise must pause from his agenda to protect Diaz from the harm she would suffer only because of their chance encounter. The chemistry between Cruise and Diaz is one of the reasons this movie works so well. Another reason is that both these actors give such convincing performances.The action sequences are thrilling. The comedy is amusing. The romance is touching. And there are some plot twists that keep one interested. This is a movie worth watching again and again even after you know how it comes out.",Knight and Day

201,poicop,The most action fun at a movie since Live Free Die Hard! People Yelled out for the hero! CRUISE!,8,28 June 2010,"Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz were excellent. The story although going through many rewrites, was very enjoyable, and Tom Cruises performance is what really puts a smile on my face. Diaz was perfect in the leading lady role. I like Tom. Not really clear why all the media attention or Tom bashing continues on this artist still. I hope this movie does well for him, and most of the people on the message boards...I don't think they even saw the film?I took my wife out the theatre and we had an enjoyable time, and I would recommend this film to anyone. I would see it again.It's not Mission impossible, and Tom doesn't have any James Bond toys, but it's very well done, spy, thriller, comedy, action, romance, who's lying, who's telling the truth. TOM and CAMERON Rocked It! Good Job!No spoilers from me, but people should know that I am a professional movie watcher, who can't understand why some movies are made, released, and they should be straight to video. And movies like these get bashed. Well worth the money. Good date movie for all ages. I think some of the violent fighting might be a little to much for some of the little ones. Maybe 10 and above, if your ten year old can handle it. There were a few in the theatre. They enjoyed it to. In fact some other adults yelled out for the hero in the movie, and that doesn't happen these days anymore...that often. And it's not in 3D.",Knight and Day
202,portsea,He's Back....,9,22 July 2010,"Not the greatest story every written, but then surely nobody expected it to be. Fun, gripping and very entertaining, cinematography was stunning, locations were perfect... . I could never say i liked cruise, and probably tall poppy syndrome would be to blame, but i always felt he was formulaic in the previous action roles, but he was pure entertainment in this, and frankly, for a man now his age, carried the action perfectly. Although some of the stunts were far over the top, he still made it just believable. By no small part maybe Diaz made him open up, she is a master actress, both beautiful, but talented in a comedy role. Some how, she seems to make cruise more human, or do i mean natural.... Anyway, loved every minute of this film, frankly, i wish it went on for another hour. both were so easy to watch.....do something else please, and hurry.....",Knight and Day
203,shorvath55,1 of the most idiotic films I ever saw! Don't waste your time on it!,1,4 January 2011,"I rented the movie the other day, not knowing what to expect from it at all. After I saw this complete and utter nonsense, I was glad it only cost me a Dollar Fifty for the rental. For starters, I am not a big fan of Tom Cruise, but I let that slide because I was more curious about Cameron Diaz. She too was disappointing in this production. The story revolves around a unique battery that government agents try to get their hands on. The so called genius who invented this battery is played a young man who looks more like a retard than a genius any day of the week! For an hour and a half You'll see these two running from the government's secret service agents who are after the battery that could revolutionize energy production world wide. Just as this theory is an impossibility, so is getting any enjoyment out of this film which in my opinion is total and utter crap, and a complete waste of time!",Knight and Day
204,seany_c,Sit Back & Enjoy,7,18 September 2010,"Don't listen to whatever the critics say about this film. If you can just switch off and enjoy a film then you'll enjoy this. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz are perfectly cast and the spark between them is genuine from the start. It's full of well choreographed action, witty dialogue and pure fun. If you're not a fan of the stars I'm sure you'll enjoy them in this. I'd think anyone would find it hard not to. It seems Cruise has been stuck in a bit of a rut in recent times with his personal life and film choices. But 'Knight & Day' is a welcome return to form. Diaz also impresses and nails her scenes with Cruise. Overall, entertaining and a pleasure to watch. ***/*****",Knight and Day
205,aj-to,How in the world does he stay that young???,7,5 January 2012,"Tom Cruise is about my age - well, that is to say: he's four years and five days younger. So I'm 53 now (although I still feel like 25) but look far younger. But when I look in the mirror I definitely see a man who fairly has passed his 40th year, grey and all. Why then is it that Tom still seems, say, 35? I wonder and find it unbelievable. And his play is always very skillful. Even when you may not like him as an actor (some people have their preferences) you must admit that he's convincing and has strong acting skills. A movie with Cruise always is enjoyable. And so with this one. There's action, fun, romance, humor, speed, and turning points. And Cameron Diaz is his worthy opponent; she's very suited for the role and plays it wholeheartedly. Go see this one, and you come to like Cruise and Diaz even better.",Knight and Day
206,filmbantha,Waste of time,4,3 August 2010,"There are some films that you just know you're not going to enjoy before even walking into the cinema. Knight and Day was one such film for me; in the back of my mind I was hoping that I could be pleasantly surprised, but unfortunately it turned out to be as horrendous as I first suspected, with lacklustre performances from actors past the peak of their careers.Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz star in this action comedy which fails miserably in both the action and comedy stakes. Cruise has no problems slipping back in to the role of a secret agent whilst Diaz is the stereotypical Blonde who becomes an unwilling partner in his daring exploits. Although they still have a great screen presence and a definite chemistry, Tom and Cameron have reached a new low with Knight and Day, its only appeal being the reunion of the two actors who must have a lack of good scripts being offered their way.Billed as a summer blockbuster, Knight and Day can not even be compared to other recent successful blockbusters such as Toy Story 3 and Inception, and doesn't even come close to the duff remake of The Karate Kid. If any other actors were in the main roles, this would be a complete failure at the box office and a film destined for the bargain bin. The action scenes are predictable and grossly unrealistic, for those daft enough to pay the asking price, prepare yourself for a ridiculous bike chase amongst the running of the bulls.Stay away from this awful film, even though it was a preview screening and my tickets were free, I am annoyed at losing two hours of my life. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz need to realise that their days as respected celebrities will be numbered if their attempts to replicate the earlier successes of their careers continues. Knight and Day could possibly be the worst film of the year so far, although I do have tickets for Step Up 3-D and The Last Airbender so this could soon change...",Knight and Day
207,the-timelord-victorious,A genuinely fun flick.,8,8 August 2010,"This is no where near a masterpiece, and I didn't expect it to be. This is a film that doesn't take itself seriously, and... it's great. I know this won't win any awards, and it doesn't deserve to. At the end of the day though, it's a movie that's supposed to entertain and it delivers. KNIGHT AND DAY is utterly hilarious, as well as having the perfect blend of action and comedy. I would give this one 5 stars, but there's two things that really bug me. The first 15 minutes really drag on, and when I say really, I mean REALLY. Once Cruise gets on that plane, the movie really picks up. The last 15 minutes are awful, and I absolutely HATED the dialogue reversal thing they did. Sure, a quote or two would be nice, referencing Roy and Junes time together, but an epic speech? No thanks. Overall though, this was bloody good fun. Cruise and Diaz make an unlikely couple, and Cruise himself makes this hilarious to watch. Oh, and I didn't understand the title. I get the Knight part, but who the hell is day?I loved it. Highly recommended.",Knight and Day
208,amarjunchu,Good enough if you want more Tom Cruise as a spy!,7,10 December 2017,"We have already seen Tom cruise play a spy in a lot of movies and here again he does the same. If you want more of him as a spy then that is exactly what you are gonna get in this one. The movie is not bad and has good comedy, but it's not great either. It is something that you can describe as good enough and thats the only negative aspect that matters because we expect great things from him and his movie. We do not want some just good enough experiences.",Knight and Day
209,hazel-752-685975,It was alright...,6,22 February 2011,"This film is very James Bond. It's fun, it's flashy and has a reasonably twisty plot. Nuff' said.The hero is a agent who is difficult to trust, is almost perfect in terms of witty banter and killing, drugs and drags along an innocent woman without her permission and in general seemed like a cardboard cut out to me. He never seemed to raise his voice above a whisper which annoyed me, same goes for his companion.The heroine has a lot more to her, the film seems to focus more around Cameron Diaz then Cruise in this. It's interesting to watch her character's skills grow throughout it and then see her effectively getting what I like to think of as her own back on Roy towards the end of the film with the drugging.Either way, the majority of the film is spent with one of the main characters being drugged or in a chase/fight/explosion scene. One of the few things good about this film is that the chase/fight/explosion scenes were good, yeah completely unrealistic, undramatic and Hollywood style but they looked cool. That's their whole point in the first place! See it for the effects, the fun and the plot, not much else.",Knight and Day

Amazing chases, rib smashing fight scenes with absolutely anything on the planet(fists, guns, knives, glasses, seat belts and what not),plenty of comedy and quite a chemistry between the leads.There is absolutely nothing in the world that Roy cannot do. (I feel Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz should make more movies together!) Although most of the action scenes seem a bit too implausible, Tom Cruise manages to pull it off with charisma.

And that annoys me, because it is clear she can do so much better. It is simply settling for the role of pretty girl who is taught to be lazy, cash in on her looks (babyface lolita airhead kind of charm) and simply skate through life. Ugh...Funny enough this is exactly why the SA&W approach saves the movie; she can go through the motions without doing too much damage, Tom Cruise is his usual over the top self and takes the mickey out of his own well versed genre. And that is what makes this movie palpable.To end on a high note regarding Cameron Diaz: I liked her in ""The holiday"", I didn't remember her role in ""Being John Malcovich"", the fact she is in there is a point in her favor. I looked it up, she was not in the way. But most of all I actually loved her in ""She's the one"".

I think I laughed more during this movie than at many so called ""comedies"" that are out today. It has it all - action, comedy, fun, good guys, bad guys, romance and a little spy stuff thrown in. Both Tom Cruise and Cammeron Diaz are quite good in the film and they seem to be having a lot of fun. The chemistry between the two is great.

216,kemicon,not a terrible movie but your suspension of disbelief will be working over time,6,28 June 2010,"I went into Knight and Day expecting it to be terrible, which was fine because I was supposed to see the A-Team which I'm sure was even worse. I was entertained by this film, it has a decent pace (although the first ten minutes drag) and it does a fair amount of James Bond like globe hopping which is good eye candy. The dialog was also quite good and both Cruise and Diaz deliver their lines with excellent timing that helps banter that might not be so funny on paper, sound better when they say it. Cruise is probably the stand out, his character reminded me a little of Vince from Collateral with more humor and less creepiness. In contrast however I found myself continual thinking that Cameron Diaz looked weird and alien like. The directors insistence on using so many super close face shots did her no justice. Diaz has a great body and she is more of an entire package actor, having a few more pull out shots would have done her sex appeal great justice.So why score this film a six you might be wondering? Well you've kind of already seen this movie, it feels really familiar so don't expect any surprises. Also the use of ""I got drugged so I'm fading in and out of consciousness and now I'm like 4,000 miles from where I was before"" is totally over done to the point where you'll be thinking, ""really... you're doing this again"".Lastly there are almost no real looking stunts in this movie. They all appear to be done with a ton of CGI, there are even cows done in CGI. In the end it gives a fake-ness to the whole film that makes you pine for better spy movies like the Bourne identity.",Knight and Day

I just don't understand why they felt it necessary to insult your intelligence at every turn with camp and completely ridiculous action. All this stupidity was beyond absurd and I just don't find moronic and impossible cartoon stunts fun to watch. Luck saved the day every time you turned around, not skill and that aggravates a viewer after a while. I thought I'd find a guilty pleasure. Instead, what I found was a waste of time and an insult to my active brain cells. Summer deserves better than this and better than what Tom Cruise is delivering nowadays.

What made me want to see this film was the same reason I saw ""Date Night"" earlier this year. It is your classic buddy-buddy romantic-comedy action film with a leading male character and a leading female character. It hearkens back to the films of the 70s & 80s with Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn or Mel Gibson and Goldie Hawn. This one takes an espionage angle and throws in the action and humor not unlike the Roger Moore Bond films or the Dean Martin Matt Helm films. It surrounds a story involving the transportation of a small Super-Battery that all the bad guys want. I also went to see this movie because I still love Cameron Diaz, but anyway .. You can clearly tell that the producers saved money on the special effects. There was a lot of bad green-screen work and some of the CGI was lame too. The editing was off and it also had a lot of continuity issues. That is the bad stuff. They had to throw the money at Cruise and Diaz, plus the locations where the film was shot were beautiful and the stunts looked great. It is a cute story and it keeps you thinking about who is bad and who is good. Cruise and Diaz work well together. The soundtrack was nice too. This is a great example of a sloppy but fun film. If they had polished up some of the technical stuff this would have received a much higher grade, but some of the mistakes were embarrassing.",Knight and Day

Cruise's characters has a lot of resemblances with his Mission Impossible character. Diaz is the not so clever girl who falls in love with him. With a plot like this, I was not expecting to see great character development or a surprising twist in the plot. Just plain entertainment. Unfortunately, I was more annoyed with how stupid it all was (""what do you mean I was not supposed to use my cellphone... can they track it???"" DUH!!). And almost every time I was nearly entertained (i.e. action!!) the silly girl blacks out and wakes up after the action happened. The writer must have thought, well you have seen mission impossible, you know what happens next. But since film is a very visible medium, I want to see it. He should have used this trick with the romantic parts of the story (Cruise blacks out every time it gets mushy). Also BIG surprises like ""you thought this was a good guy, well he is not"" and ""do you think Cruise is dead while we have 30 more minutes of the movie"" are plain stupid, we have seen it, does not work anymore. All in all, I was not amused, entertained or surprised... waste of money spend on the film...",Knight and Day

Perhaps a good way to enter a cinema; it means you'll rarely be disappointed.I was, however, delighted with this movie, and it seemed so was the bulk of the large crowd viewing it with me. Opening scenes include a fiery plane crash, witty romanticisms between Cruise and Cameron Diaz and secret agent intrigue. From here, the audience is taken across America and the globe, from Saltsburg to Seville. The stunts are amazing, with some truly fantastic car chases, but it was as much about the action as it was about Cruise and Diaz. Both gave fabulous performances, and delivered great chemistry as we rode alongside them in this mile-a-minute spectacle of a film.I really enjoyed the cinematography; it made me think of the glamorous 1960s films of 'James Bond' et al. The depiction of the luscious scenery and witty character directions have a real stylishness.While I could never figure out the significance of the title (Cruise is Knight, what was Day? A bad pun perhaps?) and the film certainly won't turn up in any VCE exams, it is well worth a watch as an action packed, fun laden romp!",Knight and Day

Cameron and Tom make a great team in these sorts of action/thriller/comedies 3. The theater was packed to the gills with an interactive entertained audience. 4. I will most definitely add this film to my Blu Ray collection 5. I think we need a sequel and it was certainly set up for a sequel. 6. The film was extremely well edited. There wasn't a single second of dead time. 7. The plot had few holes and is essentially a modification of a plot line we've seen time and time again..the falsely accused rogue agent up against the hidden corrupt government agents out to smear. Nevertheless it has some unique elements and a crisp screenplay. 8. The action sequences are a thrill ride. 9. The plot brings us to a number of exciting on location world wide locations that allow the cinematographer to set up some nice shots. Very little obvious CGI which is refreshing. 10. I was riveted and avoided completely my tendency to fall asleep at boring cookie cutter films. 11. I am perplexed over all of the Doomsday chatter about this film being a failure that marks the decline of Cruise's career. Cruise is alive and well and at the top of his game. 12. Applause. And thank God for the fact that there are other choices than Toy Story 3. 13. I give it a 10.,Knight and Day

Suspension of belief or what!! Talking of what!! What was Cameron Diaz thinking of when she agreed to co star in this not very thinly veiled attempt to portray her as a girly bimbo - surely the studio could have found some second rate actress to hang on the aliens arm. Oh I forgot, they wanted the box office kudos and dollars and boy did they get it.

This is an insult to the people who pay to watch or buy this movie believing this guy is a woman, an actress! Knight and gay would be the appropriate name for the movie at least then the consumer would have a better idea of what they are watching. This guy is pawning himself off as a woman, that is totally wrong and there are no legitimate notations to show this product is a fraudulent lie. While it's a funny movie with the pulling it off it's the expressions that give it away that Tom Cruise isn't looking at a 'woman', that he isn't kissing a 'woman'. I love Tom Cruz's acting but this woman has biceps like a body builder and monkey long arms with the face of an old man and you guys are calling him a woman? PATHETIC, I am a woman and I am INSULTED by this poorly worded label on this movie. If it's a transsexual then SAY SO and stop deceiving the public!

Tom Cruise did not put enough work into it i never knew that something this horrible is an action movie. Typical.

233,desert-jackets,Initially an entertaining movie turning to a waste of Time!,5,17 September 2013,"Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz appeared in this action-comedy movie which failed in both the action and comedy ventures. Tom Cruise as Roy Miller in this movie had no problems working as the role of a secret agent whilst Cameron Diaz is the conventional Blonde who becomes a reluctant colleague in his daring scenes. When I first saw the trailer of Knight and Day, I predicted it a fairly mainstream summer flick. I thought that having Tom Cruise back for doing his best in this action-hero character would guarantee his viewing. When I finished seeing it, I felt about as though I should be reviewing on two separate films.Hauling a bagful of metal scrap to repair her father's old car, Cameron Diaz as June Havens is on her way to her sister's wedding when she accidentally met handsome and charming Roy Miller (Tom Cruise). After continually meeting each other at the airport and finally on the same flight, they began to flirt with each other.The first half part of this movie assures a firm, fun experience due mainly to the jokes between Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. These two have great movie chemistry and some scenes between them are extremely hilarious. It's the perfect combination of comedy and action, and everything seemed to be going efficiently. It seemed like whenever the action scene was to get good they had to remind you how childish and silly this movie was to be. The amazing use of leather jacket by Tom Cruise in this movie made the jacket lovers attracted to him. The exact replica of his leather jacket is available at one of the leading websites known as desert leather. They manufacture the same leather jackets as worn by the Hollywood celebrities.Overall, ""Knight and Day"" is an OK movie due to its brand new script, great presentations, magnificent shooting incredible action, good comic timing, and an enthralling direction. And for the first time, it's actually not gratuitous!",Knight and Day
234,josef-6,Way Better than Mission Impossible,9,11 July 2010,"This movie was great! I loved it. My kids loved it. It was exactly what we expected. The outside shots of Europe were breath-taking! Tom Cruise was excellent in a comedic-dramatic role with a lot of good kidding around. I didn't like him so much in Mission Impossible. Cameron Diaz was near perfect. Those reviewers who thought it had too complicated a plot must not like action movies. Many reviewers seem to be pseudo intellectuals who just don't get action films, and would rather watch movies about ballet dancers or the mentally ill. A Beautiful Mind was so NOT Oscar material: Lord of the Rings was ten times better. Knight and Day was at least as good as Sherlocke Holmes, and it was way better than either Twilight movie. It is not going to be a classic like Indiana Jones, but then how many movies are? My sons thought it was ""awesome"" and we give it nine stars out of ten.",Knight and Day
235,GFDTommasino,Entertainment at it's best............Tom & Cameron rock!!!!,5,22 May 2011,"....a 10, yes TEN, for entertainment.. a great escape!!Before I say anything else, I have to say I have NEVER been a fan of Tom Cruise, and I was never crazy about Cameron Diaz either. But wow!!! this film rocks solid. I am glad I saw it because outside of ""Collateral"" Tom Cruise has NEVER impressed me. I have a lot of respect for Tom if he can make films as entertaining as Knight and Day. I think Tom's strength as an actor lies in the suddenness of the change in his character and (in Knight and Day) Tom makes even the incongruence of his lines work brilliantly. For example Tom's lines bang in the thick of the highway chase are the coolest!! Knight and Day rocks solid because it never stops. Knight and Day is a thriller and comedy-romance all rolled into one, and doesn't PRETEND to be either because it doesn't take itself too seriously. The chemistry between Cameron and Tom sparkles (or I am no judge of chemistry). In the first 15 minutes the pace of the film changes from ordinary to mind-blowing. I totally loved the split personality thing that happens when Cameron is in the toilet and out. And Cameron's reflections when she is in the toilet, esp. the line about the reflexes..so on message...because I was thinking the very same thing.I don't know what it was about the dialogue but I thought it was sharp and funny :-), and Cameron and Tom made it fun. Tom has great and funny lines like ""what number do you like?!!"" (my quote may be a little off). They don't make entertainment like Knight and Day too often. So grab it while you can.After the first hour or so the film loses steam a TAD but picks it right up as soon as Cameron starts to see things clearly beginning with the motor-bike ride.........Great non-stop entertainment....the film unquestionably earns it's stripes...if you are ever looking for a fun film which has that special something going for it, including dialogue (...okay lines) then Knight and Day is for you.",Knight and Day

237,marplesj,A light-hearted smirker of a film,7,10 August 2010,"Before entering the cinema to watch Knight and Day I thought - god I hate Tom Cruise, he's just weird - but after a few minutes of seeing him on screen I kind of forgot about my disliking for him and began to chuckle whenever he's on screen. As one of my esteemed cinema-going compatriots pointed out, he seems to now be relishing making fun of himself in his roles (following his Tropic Thunder escapade) and this actually quite suits him.Don't get me wrong, there are still moments in the film where he endeavours to be mr smouldering charmston and at these points you find yourself cringing a bit. But during the action sequences Cruise is nothing short of hilarious - even the way he runs his laugh out loud funny.On the leading lady front, Diaz plays her usual ditzy self. I found her to be a bit like Phoebe was in Friends, all of the jokes happen, you laugh and then she chips in with a 'funny' remark and you just think 'yeah, OK...you're just not that funny'. Her funniest scene involves her constantly falling in and out of consciousness (which says a great deal), waking up in increasingly dangerous situations - dungeon, helicopter, parachute jump... but to be honest this falls more on Cruise's action-like hilarity once again rather than Diaz herself.All in all, Kinght and Day surprised me as being a genuinely funny, quirky film. Yes it has a traditional blockbuster storyline involving bad guys, corrupt cops etc, but the appeal of this film doesn't lie in a twisting tale of great depth, it lies in the visual humour of Cruise, something (which I never thought I would say) I hope continues in his following projects.",Knight and Day

The perfect date movie if you like drugging your dates.From the first reference to Something About Mary, you know this film is shaky. But it gets much much worse. The plot is virtually handed to you on a silver platter. And if you get lost, there is plenty of dead air time where there is always someone that tells you what is happening. Even crazy scientists.The opening theme music made you feel like you were watching some psychological thriller, but then never goes there. The romance comes off feeling forced from the moment June (Cameron Diaz) peps herself up in the toilet of an airplane while Roy(Tom Cruise); her soon to be beau in Rohyponol dating, is busily killing people. And that is where most of the romance stays for the rest of the movie. In an airplane toilet.The CGI is at times childish. Maybe they are doing a homage to bad special effects I thought. Like the other miss-homages to Risky Business and the aforementioned Something About Mary, as well as scenes of Mi4 on a roof in China only this time in another part of the world. As I already stated, the homages started and began to fail immediately for me. Miss-homage after miss-homage had the film hemorrhaging all over the cinema floor.Some may call it a tongue in cheek movie. Some call it a popcorn movie although it better be some damn good popcorn! Unfortunately for me, the tongue in my cheek was bitten on firmly by the mind numbing script and I too found myself hemorrhaging. Luckily this film is so industrial strength cheesy in parts, I used bits of that to stop the bleeding and crawled out into the light of a much better world. Not for having seen the film.

243,rach_dll,Cruise & Diaz still got it!,5,13 July 2010,"Knight and Day Knight and Day passes for a decent romantic action comedy flick. Considering the amount of rom-coms coming out these days, more than half of which are below average, Knight and Day is rather watch-able.June Havens(Cameron Diaz) is a hot looking woman in her 30's, but one who has not lived her life yet, hasn't been out of the country, a rather sad and boring life altogether. In comes Roy Miller(Tom Cruise), an apparently rogue CIA agent, who meets June at the airport 'by chance'. June is going to her younger sister April's wedding when this so called 'accident' happens when she bumps into Roy Miller twice at the airport. They end up taking the same flight wherein she kinds of falls for the cool and macho looking Tom Cruise and decides to make a move. Once she is in the loo, Tom Cruise sets off on killing all on board, there aren't many, and at this point one doesn't know who they are and what they want really. As June gets out of the loo, not realizing there have been gun shots fired, makes her move. Sadly things don't go any forward since the pilots are dead too and Roy has to crash land the plane. Then begins a series of events where Roy and June end up going to places all over the world, from the US to Spain to Germany to Austria to a random undiscovered island somewhere! The bad guys, there are many, want something from Roy. And now since June is involved too, they both are making a run for it. A couple of more characters are included in the film, but they are of hardly any importance. That's all there is to this film really. But that is what works best for it too. You don't need to think too much! Cameron Diaz looks surprisingly old in this flick. Although in some scenes she does manage to look her old gorgeous self, but mostly her face looks like she's got 3 kids. But in-spite of all that she still has those moments when you totally fall in love with her. There is still that old charm from 'The Mask' left in her. And she can still act pretty decently, at least in a film like this. Tom Cruise is still the same cool looking dude that he was in 'Top Gun', although obviously older and a lot bigger it seems. But he still looks nice and plays his role in a pretty nice and sober way. No over the top jumps on the couch this time around! After films like 'Identity', 'Walk The Line', '3:10 To Yuma', director James Mangold has tried his hands on a rom-com and done fairly well, although the film could have been much much better. The action sequences are way too fake to give you a real roller coaster feel, Tom and Cameron escaping thousands of bullets from 10s of bad guys reminds of you good old action flicks of the 90's in India where Sunil Shetty was the hero! The soundtrack is nice and happy. The locations in some of the scenes are breathtaking. Overall I'd say its a job well done. You won't feel your money is wasted once you're done watching this film. And I am sure all you Cruise fans out there are going to love this film. Cameron fans are in for a treat too. Cheers! 5/10",Knight and Day
244,JamMovieReviews,Less than it could have been,5,23 December 2010,"This really an oxymoron of a movie in that I enjoyed it, but I did not really enjoy the main actors as the characters they played in the film. I couldn't tell if they were playing this movie as serious and making this movie a comedy by overacting or if they were playing things for laughs and just not connecting right. Tom Cruise's character comes off as either unlikeable or just overly smug with himself. Maybe it is just Tom Cruise bias on my part but I really enjoyed his Mission Impossible series so I can buy him as the secret agent, but I just could not buy him as Roy Miller, the part really did not ever seem to be under his control.As for Cameron Diaz, my problem with her was during the ""serious"" parts. For my recommendation If you are a fan of either actor, it can be a fun romp through the spy world at times, but it also has its moments that just feel wrong.

Cameron tried her best to make things seem romantic between her and Cruise. But Tom was the one who wasn't really getting along with Diaz. Is it because, *He's a douche-bag?or, *He's married?or, *He doesn't like Diaz personally?or, *He's too full of himself?2.

Sure they both look good in this movie, but those fake smiles couldn't save this movie from being a complete disaster.3. The plot is so messed up. In short, not interesting and predictable. Also this movie is filled with stupid and cheesy dialogs.4. When I go to see an action movie, I expect some really good action. But unfortunately, this movie has failed me in that department too. When we need action, it not there and when we don't need action, it's there. The bull-chasing scene is something I found completely ridiculous.Anyway, I hated this movie. I gave it a 4/10.

248,arunk-613-852555,Good watch if you want to see good acting,8,13 July 2010,Knight and Day is a watchable movie. Its lead pair have delivered an outstanding performance. What I liked about the movie is the spontaneous acting of Cameroon Diaz as she uncovers the dangers that lie in front of her and how Tom Cruise pragmatically tries and successfully convinces her that all is well. It looked all so real. Not like most movies where you would feel how a character would believe other in such circumstances. Tom cruise plays smooth talker spy. And Diaz is an intelligent blonde who is swayed by his talks.There is isn't much in the story line and the direction is average. Action sequences are good though. You wouldn't get bored one bit while watching it. There is lot of humor in it especially while the lead pair have conversation with each other. They compliment each other perfectly.Watch it if you want to see a light hearted action-comedy film with damn good acting.

But I decided to give it a shot...I will start with what I don't like: Almost everything!As soon as the movie started I knew I'm gonna suffer for the next 109 minutes. The movie has so many flaws and the acting was at the level of some '90s soap operas. Stupid, empty dialogs and childish looks gave me the feeling someone wanted to put two adults to play teenagers.The story? Very disappointing. Our dear Cruise somehow failed to leave the impression of a secret agent (probably because he was always trying to show that smile of his which made him an actor), while Diaz showed that she still can't act any further than whining and showing her fake teeth. Also, I don't think real secret agents steal the most expensive cars to drive around...Now for the worst part: Explosions and bullets. Yeah, yeah, I get it. Explosions are a must in action movies. Great! But this movie had the most idiotic ways to use explosions and bullets. (warning, spoiler ahead) I stopped counting at 5billion bullets fired, and then all of a sudden, even though he used the past 100 minutes to avoid bullets, Cruise walks slowly through a shower of bullets fired from automatic guns without getting hit? Come on!!! (end of spoiler)The explosions-counter wasn't really busy, but my brain almost exploded because of the stupid way the movie used explosions like (spoiler) the airplane crash (end of spoiler).And now, for the good stuff. After watching 109 minutes, and suffering from different kinds of nervousness, I managed to find something that is great in the movie: 1. The cars - everyone loves to see old timers, whether they're wrecked or look like new, they're beautiful. 2. (MAJOR SPOILER) the sentence ""someday is an excuse for never"" really hit me.

When the movie began, it started out a little slow. After a little while the movie did finally pick up the pace. Because of this, I do think the writers could have written a better beginning.

But there were a few flaws that just kept this from being on par with a Mr & Mrs Smith kind of movie. In that movie, there was plenty of comedy, action, and just a sense of coolness that this didn't have. I'm not saying I wanted a repeat of Mr & Mrs Smith, I was just kind of looking forward to some cool action with comedy thrown in.First of all, the chemistry between Cruise and Diaz just seemed forced. Cruise had this glazed over look the ENTIRE movie as if his character was just a beaten puppy going through the motions of a spy. In the Mission Impossible movies, I felt like he was actually a spy and he had a lot of emotion. But I just couldn't get past the vacant look in his eyes the whole time. His age is starting to show a little in his face and like he's desperately trying to hold on to the younger action roles he used to play. This translates into the chemistry between him and Cameron Diaz's character. I'm not sure I can even describe it, but there was just something missing in Cruise's performance that made him seem so distant. Maybe it was some sort of confidence....I think that might be it. His character seemed to lack that bad@$$ confidence we expect from our cool spies. It was like ""OK...I'm awesome. Sigh...but who cares. Guess I'll kill this guy.""The second thing that bugged me was how much was given away in the trailer that sucked the life out of the movie. There were some pretty decent action scenes, but they were almost all shown in the previews. I hate when films do that, but I know they gotta suck people in first and foremost with the eye candy. Along with that complaint, I gotta mention that the CGI was a little weak. Some chase scenes were just a bit too easy to peg as blue screen shots.Those pickings aside, it was a enjoyable watch that will suffice as a average to slightly above average action/(barely)comedy/ date movie. There's definitely a few movies I would put above this one on the must sees for the summer before devoting your money to this. But it's probably worth a matinée.",Knight and Day
252,grant-265,A bit of a turkey,5,19 February 2011,"Sorry - this film was so bad that I kept comparing it to one of the Leslie Neilsen spoof action movies. The plot was tenuous based on an impossibly stupid premise. The sequences where a complicated escape was required were brushed over by simply having Ms Diaz drugged or made unconscious. We the audience were drugged along with her and never knew how for example, our hero escaped several state-of-the art combat aircraft in a tiny two-man helicopter. Such cop-out sequences were frequent and suggested lazy writing where the writer used a device to avoid inventiveness and creativity. The call-back humour was predictable and not funny. As per usual, the bad guys were useless shots and both Cruise and Diaz were crack shots with their weapons whilst in flight or precariously balanced on motorbikes etc. If you're looking for a movie where no brains are required and you don't question the implausibility of the plot, then the movie is okay; high on 007/mission impossible action. If you're looking for and intelligence, go elsewhere.",Knight and Day

Hollwood just keeps making terrible films these days and this is one of the worst in a long time. If your IQ is under 45 though i think you'll like it. Something is clearly very wrong in Hollywood if films like this get through all the filters to find the scripts to get made. It trys to be cool and funny but its just dreadful, the DVD goes on sale in UK in December and if anybody is stupid enough to buy it you have been warned. i hated it as much as Alexander the 2004 oliver stone rubbish film or little miss sunshine or eraser head the David lynch disaster, yep its that bad.",Knight and Day
254,mikfisher64,A looney tune,5,27 September 2010,"When i first heard of this film i knew it had just about the right things to be a great movie. Come on, seeing Tom Cruise get back in touch with spy missions while having Cameron Diaz as his side-kick ? That aside, let me tell you this wasn't a movie - it felt more like a cartoon!This movie is about a rogue super-spy agent risking his life for having the possess of a superior artifact which is a source of endless energy, that can be used for the good and for the bad. In the meantime, he encounters a woman who accidentally gets in his way and the mission's - ultimately following him.Having a nice cast, great explosions and desirable locations are more than enough for producing a good motion picture right? Wrong. Plot. Please, please let it be a plot. There isn't. This movie is all about non-senseless , unthinkable and predicting scenes. Yes, there are an awesome load of action sequences, which may i point out looked pretty well done ; but there isn't much more to it - there isn't any story , the other characters don't even try to make a stance, and the gaps between the action sequences are just tedious. When i mean tedious, i mean boring, last-longing, and you will see that more than half of the movie is like this.So if you choose to see this movie, don't be surprised if you are checking your watch every 5 minutes, hoping it ends.",Knight and Day
255,rob-911-162983,Hollywood excess on display,4,1 December 2010,"Knight and Day isn't a bad film, it's just...sort of there. The first hour has some nice comedic moments, and as we discovered in 'Tropic Thunder,' Tom Cruise can be funny. Cameron Diaz portrays a character that is quickly becoming a cliché in modern comedic films: a beautiful woman who is hapless and quirky, and gets nervous around men. They have decent chemistry together, and even though Mangold is slumming here he puts together some decent action scenes.In the second hour, despite the use of gorgeous locations in Spain, the film becomes dull and repetitive. The creepy running gag where Cruise drugs Diaz's character every time she panics becomes particularly obnoxious. Peter Saarsgard collects a paycheck, and does what he can to breath life into an underwritten villain. I got a kick out the casting of Dale Dye near the end, perhaps the only moment in the film where I really smiled.In summation, this is a vaguely amusing action comedy that might help you pass time while you're waiting on a pizza or something. It wears out it's welcome in the second half, but it has its moments. According to the IMDb, a total of 8(!) writers re-worked Patrick O'Neill's script, and film making by committee would definitely explain why this bloated blockbuster feels so hollow.",Knight and Day

If you see it as a comedy movie about a spy, it stands up. If you set out to see a spy movie with a wry sense of humor, it fails miserably. If you see it as Tom Cruise playing a watered-down Ethan Hunt and Catherine Diaz playing a watered-down version of her character in Charlie's Angels, the movie is immensely enjoyable.The director seems to have his own clear idea of what the movie and the plot is all about.

259,Rick_Gershman,"It's a Beefy 5-Layer Burrito: Tastes good at first, but you'll regret it later",4,23 June 2010,"Bear with me for a minute while I talk about dinner. Trust me, it's relevant.Tuesday was a busy day. I was racing around to get everything done before the Knight and Day screening in downtown Denver.The YMCA where I exercise is just a few blocks from the theater. I got my workout in, but I only had a few minutes to eat before the movie. So I popped into the Taco Bell down the street, got two Beefy 5-layer burritos and ate them as I walked to the theater.Now, Taco Bell's Beefy 5-layer burrito is a glorious thing. It's 89 cents, which is awesome. It's incredibly filling, which is awesome. And here's the thing: It actually tastes pretty damn good. So even though I figured they'd be rotting in my colon until the day I die, at the time I was pretty damn happy with those two Beefy 5-layer burritos.A few hours later, however, I was regretting those burritos. Yummy as they were at the time, they left me feeling rather sick and bloated. My cholesterol probably hiked up about 50 points, matched only by my blood pressure. All of the good work I did at the Y, destroyed in one beefy, cheesy swoop.Which brings us to Knight and Day, the Taco Bell 5-layer burrito of the 2010 summer movie season.Actually, the metaphor doesn't quite hold true — the 5-layer burrito is less than a buck, whereas you'll be paying around 10 bucks for this action comedy starring Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. It would be a lot more palatable at 98 cents.Like my burrito, Knight and Day tastes pretty good on the first few bites. Cruise is in full-on funny, charming mode as Roy Miller, a (possibly) rogue federal agent assigned to protect a fancy energy source and its nerdy inventor. As June Havens, a Boston classic car restorer swept into Miller's mission, Diaz channels the winning sexy-goofy balance that served her well in the first Charlie's Angels movie.Though some other reviews say the starring pair lack chemistry together, I disagree. In fact, just about all of Knight and Day's charms come from the stars' interplay as Roy and June cruise along from one dangerous situation to another.And yes, ""cruise along"" is exactly what I mean — there's never the slightest sense of danger in the film, which apparently is exactly what director James Mangold was going for.If his name wasn't there on screen, you'd never guess Mangold helmed Knight and Day, which couldn't be further removed from his (far superior) other credits, which include 3:10 to Yuma, Walk the Line and Girl, Interrupted.It's hard to know whether Mangold or Patrick O'Neill's screenplay is to blame, but the flippant way Knight and Day handles its story — this is all just a video game, as grounded in reality as a Matrix film — wears out its welcome very quickly.One conceit that runs through the film has Roy drugging June whenever the action gets heavy. And since June is (mostly) the audience's proxy, that means we fade to black whenever she does. Thus, numerous scenes stop abruptly, and we never get to see the resolution. June just wakes up in a new locale. It feels like a massive cheat, perhaps intended only to lower the budget.Cruise and Diaz's star power is enough to overcome that problem for much of the first half, but after that the wheels come off.Knight and Day subjects us to some of the thinnest supporting characters of any film this year — specifically, the agents heading up the charge to corral Miller. These roles have all the weight of a Sarah Palin interview. (My conservative buddy Christian won't like that, but I hope he'll understand.)What's worse is that producers cast two superb actors in these roles — Peter Sarsgaard (An Education, Flightplan) and Viola Davis (Doubt, State of Play) — and give them nothing to work with!Also, why cast someone as recognizable as Maggie Grace (Taken, TV's ""Lost"") as June's sister and give her nothing but a couple of lines? What a massive waste of talent! It's a stark contrast to this summer's The A-Team, in which a couple of supporting roles were among the film's most interesting.All of that considered, Knight and Day remains fairly entertaining until the final act, when the formula really gets old. Sure, there's a cute bit where Diaz gets to have fun with June being under the influence of truth serum (yeah, she gets drugged a lot, which is a bit creepy).But then we get the crappiest of Knight and Day's action pieces, a car/motorcycle chase through Spanish streets that happens to coincide with the running of the bulls. The special effects for this stretch are mind-numbingly bad, looking worse than whatever your 12-year-old nephew could throw together on his Power Mac.The film has other issues, even if you're grading on the ""lighthearted summer fun"" curve. The title only half makes sense, and the way it's not-really explained seems arbitrary at best. Worse, the movie never provides a reason for Diaz's character to be involved in the story past the first half-hour.Knight and Day isn't the complete wreck the pre-release buzz might have suggested. It has some cute dialogue, some genuinely funny moments and some entertaining fight scenes. On the whole, however, it's a 5-layer burrito that's missing at least three layers. And two just won't do.",Knight and Day
260,riethc,As Entertaining as a Lobotomy,1,16 February 2011,"This film was not made for the viewing pleasure of its audiences, but rather for the sadistic pleasures of its creators. Like ""Zombieland"" and ""Tropic Thunder"", ""Knight and Day"" trumps its own genre by moving beyond any accepted framework that made movies of its ilk tolerable, and like a lobotomy it ends up removing some of the brains from the person on the receiving end of it.The only reason a film like this is even considered any where near decent, is because it uses the same ""tricks"" used by other Hollywood-films of its type, which have been deeply ingrained into the minds of its typical audience members as being good things. These acceptable ""tricks"", better called manipulations, can leave even thinking people accepting to the stupefying effects of this movie's video game violence and abrupt absurdities. The usual mix of action-comedy elements, of violence and stupid, are deployed like atomic bombs in this movie; leaving the audience members either in dumbstruck awe or confused by complete inanity.AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS.

The odd thing is, we both couldn't stop talking about it after we saw it. I just loved Cameron in the beginning scene at the airport when she's in the airplane restroom talking to herself and building confidence totally unaware what is going on inside the main plane section (I don't want to give anything away so I'll stop there). She was so much fun and I really liked the way her character took charge in the end. Yes, I like it when women take charge in a movie, I'm a woman. Of course, my boyfriend got his share of adrenaline right from the start. That was one of the things we talked about. The scene I mentioned when Cameron is in the bathroom and Cruise is running about the plane kicking butt. We were both really enjoying that moment and for totally different reasons.

I know what you are thinking and yes you are reading that right. You're thinking ""He gave this only 1 vote how can he say that?"". Well I came in expecting much, much worse having a very lame story involving Tom Cruise. It is a very bad movie but since I was expecting worse I was surprised and maybe too generous in my voting but I stick with my 1 vote. Tom Cruise has never been a good actor and his choices for what movies to play in have been more and more obvious cash grabs. Cameron Diaz used to do good stuff but has for a while been doing bad stuff, so when you put those 2 together with a garbage storyline as this then you end up with the stuff that this movie is. Like I said I was expecting worse so it is not as bad I thought it would be.

This film is a prime example of ""either you get it or you don't"". If you go with the clearly tongue-in-cheek approach, you love it. The sillier it gets, the more you love it. Especially when it plays the silliness so straight, which is the best way to go. Act as if it's all normal, and it's hilarious. Act as if you're being funny, and it's just painful.

Come on, even paraphrased, how funny is that?Some people disliked the truncated action scenes, such as the glimpses a drugged June sees during their escape to the island, even suggesting they were truncated for budget reasons. Well, maybe, but to me they were the perfect antidote to the equally-far-fetched but over- produced sequences in most action movies. Ooh, the hero is hanging upside-down by his heels, but assures us he's almost free. Wham! Somehow, he is... how? We never know, but by then it's on to the next action-movie trope (helicopter?), and the next, until finally we arrive in Paradise.For me, the characters were as convincing and real as they could be within this winking universe, and I have watched this movie several times, just for the pleasure of seeing Cruise and Diaz circle each other until they become a true fighting unit.

Enter 'Knight and Day', the pick of the night by attrition. I have to say, this is the most elated we've both been in a comedy-action-romantic in a long time. It was hysterical, and the chemistry between the two actors was pitch perfect. The action was executed perfectly and believable. So why didn't this movie dominate the box office. What happened?

The scenes with the supporting characters are great. How funny was the little bit that the parents keep on winning things like the clearing hours sweepstakes without even entering, very clever.

The ending--especially the dialog by Cameron Diaz--was terrible. It isn't her fault, writers should know when things sound stupid. That said, the middle is okay. There is plenty of failed humor, and lines that are just pointless. The characters are almost interesting. Diaz and Cruise play well together. They did an excellent job with a mindless script. The effects were decent, and there is plenty of action. This is almost enough to give it an extra star. Still, you can't fail on both the beginning and the end and get a marginal score.

June's character was so extremely annoying and one-dimensional, always acting the damsel in distress and always complaining about landing in one far-fetched scenario after another.Frequently throughout the film the bad guys are attacking with advanced gadgetry, Roy invariably perform gravity defying feats and acrobatics. Meanwhile, June will shout, whine, and complain about being dragged into various situations, which she is unaccustomed. Her shtick just became aggravating after a while because she really added nothing productive to the plot. Half-way through I was just hoping her character would die.Alas, this film could have been good with more humor and less dependence on fish-out of water routines.",Knight and Day

Say this, even if I love Cameron Diaz. Probably the examination plot can approach the kind espionage. The couple Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise is rich in alchemy and could have worked. however, he showed a good love story, platonic, fresh but with a delightful predictable end.

280,filmcritics-90397,"Good Directing, Mediocre Acting, Insufficient Scenario",6,7 February 2019,"I decided to watch this film because of Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz on the cover. I think the producers also had this, and possibly only this, in their minds, as the rest of the film can hardly attract the interests of the casual intellect.Expecting a full-blown romantic comedy action(?) from the combination of sexy Cameron Diaz who as always shines beautifully on screen and cool Tom Curise who uses no stunts and runs and jumps and rumbles (fights) as much as he can; I found, instead, a boring and unrealistic rush without a drag force on the viewers. Moreover, rest of the cast also do their (yet unhelpful) best. Effects are fine, visuals are best quality but not spectecular. Stage is professional to the extend available. All actions scenes are engineered to the masters degree. However there is a great problem in this film: it's nonesensical. And this unfortunately broke all the chemistry of the film...The problem is with the text. There's something wrong with it. It's not well defined. It's not clear. There is no emotion in this film. No excitement, no thrill, not enough fun, no clear jokes, no true love, no fear. It seems not enough effort has been spent on the story line.First of all, our guy is an unbeatable super hero? Is he really so, or is this part of the joke (comedy I mean)? Really it's not clear. Within all those action (fighting) scenes, he is just beating the next guy no matter what. He displays so much of an immortal super hero character that even Marvel or DC comic heroes dare displaying. Is this part of the intentional comedy nature of the film or just the dissappointing result of the poor character development, is again unclear. Tom C. displays the perfect secret agent in full cliché. No inventions of any kind is invested in him. Just a combination of his previous action stereotype roles. His cool voice stayed down cool, even in the most dramatic scenes just as in the landing of the plane, FBI chasing (he was on the hood of the full-throttle blind driven convertable in the middle of the heavy traffic and still saying ""June, please open the door"" as polite as he would on a Romantic dinner table). That's either he also felt the unnecessary absurdity of the non-stop action scenes he is froced to from one scene to another or because that was intentional, again unclear to me.May be this is too much criticism, taking it too serious for a comedy-action genre claiming no serious bits.

One of my favorite movies, comedies. Sure there are some bloopers, but it doesn't take away from Tom Cruise playing his straight man so well off Cameron Diaz' innocent comedic acting.

284,anna-101-422772,I liked that this movie established character development.,7,11 July 2011,"""Knight and Day"" revolves around Cameron Diaz, who is boarding a plane to see her sister April get married. At first, she is forbidden to board the plane, but then the flight attendant finds a seat for her. And guess who Diaz sits next to? The inevitable Tom Cruise. After having a little ""talk"" with the pilot, the passengers, and the flight attendant, him and Diaz seek out to hunt down the antagonists, one which is played by Peter Sarsgaard. Although, Cruise warns Diaz that the bad guys will say that they are the ""FBI"" and will pretend she's in a safe place. However, through further investigation, Diaz may think that Cruise is unto something. In the meantime, the bad guys are looking for the battery and are not too thrilled about who holds its possession.First, let's get to the positives. First off, I liked that this movie established character development. Most action/comedy films fail to fully flesh out are leads and then we aren't registered with them. 3:10 to Yuma director makes us care about these characters, and when put in a tough situation, we just hope the best. Second of all, I thought the script was great. I thought this movie had some really funny one-liners and the film had great comic timing. It couldn't have been better. Thirdly, I thought that the performances were great. All the characters did their job and even stood out, especially Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise. Diaz and Cruise also had wonderful chemistry and their relationship never felt forced or phony. It came out as very authentic rather than artificial and syrupy. Moreover, I thought the film's pacing was excellent. The film is shy of two hours, yet feels like half of that. After the film was over, I thought there would be at least another hour added. Furthermore, I thought the action was awesome. It definitely delivered and this is the best action I've seen in a long time. And lastly, the cinematography was just amazing. I loved the scenery and great production values I must add.There are very minimal flaws with this movie. However, there are some. First of all, I know this film is intentionally nonsensical, but some scenes went so over-the-top, that when it occasionally was meant to be serious, it came off as cheesy or laugh worthy, fortunately, like I said, occasionally. Second of all, I enjoyed this movie so much that I just wish it were longer. Overall, ""Knight and Day"" is a great film because of its fresh script, great performances, amazing action, great comic timing, breathtaking cinematography, and a fascinating direction. And for the first time, it's actually not mindless! If you keep your brain on, you'll still thoroughly enjoy it. If you were disappointed by ""Killers"", don't worry, so was I, because you will still like this movie. Shoot, I enjoyed it so much I think it's even better than ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"" which I liked. ""Knight and Day"" is one of those rare movies that just works on every level and is one of those rare movies that is worth full admission. See it at night with a large crowd, with a big bucket of popcorn, and a drink, and you'll have a blast. I enjoyed the movie so much that I wanted it to last from ""Knight"" to ""Day"". It comes highly recommended.",Knight and Day

It did not do well at the box office domestically because U.S film critics were harsh, but it performed superbly in the international market. International films fans understood to not take it too seriously. Both Tom and Cameron performed well in their roles. They had some adorably funny lines to deliver. Regardless of what is in the gossip columns on these actors, they are good, great actors depending on the roles and scripts they are given. If you want to see a nice escape from reality type movie, watch this one. About 2 weeks after I purchased the three disc combo, I enjoyed the extended version as well.

But when I saw it, it was definitely not what I was expecting. I'm not saying it was bad, just that I think it could have been way better than how it was. I mean Tom's acting was phenomenal and Cameron is doing better. They make a good couple, better than Ashton and Katherine in Killers & Gerard and Jennifer in The Bounty Hunter. It's just that the movie was kind of like those movies, well more like Killers than Bounty Hunter, but still like them.I mean in both Knight and Day & Killers, Tom is a secret agent and so is Ashton. Except in Killers they fall in love in the beginning, in Knight and Day, they fall in love towards the end of the movie. And in both movies, the women (Cameron and Katherine) are learning how to fight and use a gun. They are both being chased by people who are trying to kill them and the men (Tom and Ashton) come to save them. And at the end, there's a twist that you weren't expecting. But Knight and Day is still a good movie, especially for Tom Cruise fans. And of course, it is better than both Killers and Bounty Hunter most definitely.Besides the acting which was good, the comedy was kind of going a little to far, like in Grown Ups, but then it was better. So I say see it, it's a good action, comedy movie. Has good acting with some pretty good comedy. If you've seen the movie Killers, you would kind of understand how it is like it, but way better. But for me, it's not what I was expecting after seeing the trailer. But it was still a good summer movie :)",Knight and Day

Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise have great chemistry (stemming from previous projects with each other like Vanilla Sky maybe). The scenes with the two of them (most of the movie of course) were great. I loved the subtle ""jabs"" the movie took at other spy flicks while still taking itself seriously enough.It's not going to win an Oscar, but it's definitely a fun movie to go see with friends or on a date. I took a chick with me and we both had a blast. I feel sorry for anyone who's too uptight or jaded by Tom Cruise's personal life and beliefs to enjoy this film.I do have a couple of beefs with the film. I feel the movie would have been just perfect had it been about 20 minutes shorter. 110 minutes is not that bad but for such a fun movie with quick action; a shorter run time would have had me craving for more. Then again, my movie attention span seems to be getting shorter the older I get. I'm also unsure of how the movie will translate over to home viewing.

Firstly it's not meant to be taken seriously, I assume ! Just an escape action movie. Lots of fast action , only one overly gory scene with a knife , and I liked there wasn't blood splatters with all shooting.I like Tom cruise in action and even doing some funny lines in this too. It's mostly Diaz's character,I found had to believe, as she was so trusting , when she went into the car with all male agents , she should of fought and called out for help from her family , and the constant screaming I found unrealistic , trying to make her not be as tough or smart. And staying with him after he murders so many people , and how she's actually falling for him when he drugs her many times , it's like hey I'm single and he is handsome & a murder but hey let's keep hanging out ! And while drugged he changes her clothes, it's so creepy and comical, because if he was unattractive she'd be mortified and disturbed. I did like that she actually tried to beat him up when she was on the island , but even that turned romantic , just wishing there wasn't so much screaming. Tom cruise was great on it though ! Always believable !",Knight and Day

It was an action-ridden movie with some comedy elements, that didn't pretend to be any more than that. I guess you could say it was along the lines of From Paris With Love.Cruise's acting is usually over the top and in this case that worked perfectly; the way he delivered his lines provided some comedy on itself and really suited the movie as a whole.

This is the movie that Killers wanted to be, but while that one never quite lived up to it's potential, this was surprising in that it exceeded my expectations. Definitely worth the price of the tickets and theater popcorn--and that's saying something.The special effects were adequate, but not overpowering, the action was fast, the chase scenes well executed, and while the plot was not all that unusual or surprising, the characters were interesting and created enough interest that I cared what happened to them.All in all it was a good time, and good enough that I won't complain if I ""have to go to it again"" so my wife can see it.

Cruise is at his best when he plays these type of comedic roles. He seems in his element and very comfortable being the funny man with a nice sarcastic edge. I agree with an earlier reviewer that commented that both Cruise and Diaz's facial expressions and non-verbal communication made the movie that much more enjoyable. Also Paul Dano added a nice touch. Diaz is just all around funny and charming in this role. I just have to say that there are some scenes and interplay between Cruise and Diaz that literally had the theater in stitches with laughter. They certainly have a chemistry. I read in a review that the performance of this movie will be used in the decision on whether Cruise will be in MI:4. That's unfortunate because these are two different movie genres though they have the appearance of the same movie (Tom being a gun toting, shoot em up kind of action figure) and I believe he's still bankable.

It elicited laughs from us and a couple of times, some people from the audience clapped! Ha! Ha! The action scenes are just right. And one of the things that I really liked about it is that the movie was able to be funny without resorting to offensive measures (i.e. Borat). Cameron Diaz is perfect for the role and Tom Cruise looked like he didn't age a day since the first M:I. How does he do that?! Yes, we ogled him. Sue us. I can't imagine any other actor playing his part. If you want to have fun in the movies, see this. If you can, get this on DVD too when it comes out. It's great for a group thing.

If you like the first twenty minutes or so, you'll enjoy the film as a whole.There are two reasons the film probably didn't work at the U.S. box office. For younger viewers, who tend to drive the box office, the stars are a bit older and their characters don't have much connection with the viewers' lives. For more mature viewers, the manic action sequences may seem pitched more for younger viewers, and the characters' love interaction probably seems too juvenile as well.That said, for me the film worked. I am an older viewer and I'm probably more juvenile than others of my age. In fact, that's what I love about summer movies, because I get to indulge that younger side of myself.",Knight and Day

Ultimately, the film centered around Diaz's character rather than Cruise's, which was unusual to see in such a film and I thought it made it refreshing and worked well.Also, just for the record, the thumbnail on the preview doesn't do the film justice.

313,truejoo,Just a Delight,10,7 July 2010,"What separates this film from the rest of the action flick schlock that gets poured down our throats these days is that it doesn't attempt to take itself seriously. My expectations were met through and through. No windshield unshattered and no explosions glanced at. Perhaps the best thing about the film is the great Tom Cruise's performance. Wow! He plays the role of quasi-insane secret agent gloriously! Additionally, Cameron Diaz is also in the film.... Thats about all I have to say on that matter. What I shouldn't forget to mention is the supporting cast. As wasted as the talent was, Viola Davis and Peter Skarsgaard make for great familiar faces. I don't see why they were in the film, but I don't mind spending some time with them. Finally, I love how the film lacks any semblance of plausibility. The film is founded on an implausible plot, about an absurdly skilled agent,chasing an impossibly preposterous device. The escapism was much appreciated.",Knight and Day
314,stross-1,very disappointing,3,30 May 2011,"I had heard some good things about the action sequence, but it was stupid.....Cameron Diaz manages to be in the Swiss Alps, to a tropical paradise, to her sister's wedding in a couple of days? Come On....And all of a sudden Tom Cruise shows from nowhere on her windshield.....so dumb....Supposedly, this movie was Tom Cruise's benchmark to see if he can carry Misson Impossible 4.....good luck with that....maybe he might be better jumping up and down Oprah's couch on OWN....anyway, I'm told I don't have enough lines to get this review approved, so I have to write more lines to get this approved. How come Tom Cruise shows up all of a sudden in almost every action sequence? Him and his stupid smile in every scene? Where did that come from? Even though he all of a sudden shows up in a windshield of a car in Logan tunnel in Boston...Where did that come from? Again...dumb, dumb, dumb....hopefully, this is enough lines to get this approved. if not, I'll be back......",Knight and Day
315,jstang411,OOPS...forgot the plot,4,20 June 2010,"Knight & Day Producers' Checklist:Big Huge Action Sequences -- check. Two Big Name Actors -- check. Exotic Locales -- check. Extra Set of Bad Guys -- check. Romantic Elements -- check. Plot -- OOPS...now where did I last see that?The plot is not only unbelievably and insanely convoluted, it is also torturingly twisted to just get to the next scene. Numerous times it seems they even just give up, stranding you in the middle of what should be the climax of a key scene and jumping to the next scene in a different country. If you ever see the movie you'll learn how.On the other elements:*** Action you will get. It is well-done if normally not plausible.*** The one-liners are hit-or-miss, but good for a chuckle now and then (even if the ""straight"" dialogue gave me heartburn). *** Cruise and Diaz don't exactly carry this movie, but they don't hurt it either (and with this script it would be hard to). *** Some fairly grand scenery shots to take in (and as much money as was spent on this flick there should be).*** Not much on the romance front (with just a few script alterations Diaz' role could have been filled by Ben Stiller).For me this long film (2:00) turned into a real watch-checker without a plot to make me care about either the end of the movie or the characters. After a while, I became numb to the bullets and just took in the explosions.So maybe you want to see this if you are searching for the most pure strain of mindless action flick with some comic elements, but otherwise....",Knight and Day
316,hkinney2011,"Light hearted, ridiculous fun.",10,11 June 2011,"Warning: Don't go into this movie expecting Bourne or Wanted, and even if you do, don't be a grump when it turns out to be a humorous, well thought out, balance between espionage, romance, and comedy / parody. In addition, Wichita's airport is nowhere near that nice. It's actually quite dull for the air capitol. Just a minor flaw. This movie was absolutely fantastic, and I would certainly recommend it to anyone who just wants to watch a movie with family, friends, or anyone in general. After hearing the line ""I shot the first pilot, who accidentally shot the second pilot"", I realized this would be a ridiculous comedy, and put all previous thoughts aside. I hadn't heard anything about the movie, and had been skeptical about renting it as such, I was honestly anticipating a cheesy romance about espionage rather than what it truly is. There are car chases, ludicrous gunfights, plenty of clichés, and other things that would make a serious movie terrible; however, in this, it just adds to the fun. If you want to go watch an action movie, watch an action movie, 'cause this won't be for you.",Knight and Day
317,ch_ris127,Meh. Just a light action flick with great acting.,7,1 July 2010,"How many spy thrillers have been or are going to be released this summer? Knight and Day contain a lot of solid action and laughable humor, but somehow the whole movie feels unsatisfying. It's as if you don't feel anything at all; it's all good, but not good enough to make it to the top movies list, it's recommendable though. The story is fine, though I don't really see that it plays too much part in the movie. It's the characters that took the spotlight, they are fresh, fun and never dull and always likable; Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz play the perfect role with superb acting and charm, they are the reason why the movie works. The chemistry between them really pulls things off and they basically stand out from everyone and everything, even in the huge explosions and action scenes. But what is the point of the movie other than good acting and fun scenes? That's the problem I find -- the characters are all fun, easy and uncomplicated, that's what. Cruise's character Roy Miller is an expert spy, so expertly trained that there is no doubt that he would die when getting stormed by bullets and exploded cars passing above him. Fine, heroes are supposed to be that way, but he pulls it off with a jolly smile and a beautiful face. Then there's Diaz's role as June Havens. She's a confused woman who gets involved in all the action and later on falls for Roy. But is love really that strong to be able to make an auto-repairer woman with no combat training voluntarily face a group of brutal Spanish gunmen? Isn't she afraid to get shot on spot? I mean, they could've just killed her and get the stuff they wanted afterward. The personality change, or more correctly, the sudden change in response is just fast enough to make the character unbelievable or flat and scripted. But again, this is a romantic comedy, not a serious action. I don't mind the minor problems mentioned above, and it really doesn't ruin anything, but it makes the movie normal, like I said, it feels empty. If you're looking for a shallow fun action flick, a very, very light action flick, then the movie's good to go. But be warned, the action is mostly anticipated and CGI generated and light. I suppose that good acting and solid stuff just isn't enough nowadays.",Knight and Day
318,irelanda69,Lacks... Almost Everything That Isn't Over-Done,2,26 December 2011,"Everything about this movie can be seen on the surface. I feel like Hollywood is just trying to make money from showing well-known actors doing just about anything from evading cheesy fiery explosions to cheesy slow first kisses.This movie was pretty much Mission: Impossible with the characters dumbed-down and a bit of a comedic touch involved (though perhaps not intentional most of the time). I rated it so low because it lacked originality and film brilliance, but if you were looking for a good movie to put on to entertain your ten-year-old while you cook and/or make whoopee (or something), sure, toss it in!",Knight and Day
319,smetod07,What was that?,2,20 November 2010,"I thought that this is a comedy, I thought that it would end like ""Vanilla sky"" or like someone's dream, but no, it was all for real. I watched it to the end, hoping that some reasonable explanation will occur, but there was no any explanation. And even though I saw the movie two days ago, I don't remember how it ends, or what was the point. I couldn't even understand why is Cruise an agent, why is Cameron Diaz in love with him, why can't I connect with the characters. It's not even for kids. Who needs these kind of movies? Why? I like movies that you don't have to think about very much, like ""Kindergarten cop"", ""Bird on a wire"", ""Lethal weapon"", they are easy to watch, they are enjoyable, you feel entertained. I have nothing against jumping from a moving motorcycle, but only when I'm watching movies like ""Matrix"" or ""Minority report"". This movie insults me, insults my intelligence.I gave it a 2 because of those guys who did the special effects. I don't want to get more into the details of all the bad bad things this movie has, I just don't want to waste your time.",Knight and Day
320,john-paul,Slick and well crafted - espionage with a hint of tongue in cheek,7,28 July 2010,"Check your brain in at the door, grab some popcorn (or whatever your pleasure) and watch two of the words biggest screen stars play to their strengths. Knight and Day is an action comedy, which sees Cruise rebuilding his brand in the way that he knows best (wielding weapons, performing daring stunts whilst brandishing a wry smile). On top of that Diaz plays the sort of goofball Rom Com role that she has made her own her throughout her career.Cruise plays Roy Miller a rogue secret agent who is trying to protect a perpetual energy source and its creator from 'the bad guys'. A chance encounter sees June Havens (played by Diaz) caught up in the situation and she finds herself being dragged along on an ultra-dangerous journey to ensure the safety of Miller's charge and ultimately get her life back to normal.The film is slick, has some very well crafted and choreographed fight sequences, cracking car chases and a twisting and turning plot that, although not overtly testing, does keep it fresh throughout. And of course the on-screen chemistry works well meaning the romantic side of the tale does hold up in the face of all that is going on. On the negative side the string of time passage sequences and the smattering of cheesiness in places did leave me squirming in my seat at times somewhat.In summary if you're looking for some light entertainment with plenty of action Knight & Day will certainly put a smile on your face. However don't expect to remain in the realms of reality for long as this film steps off that plain pretty quickly and descends into a fanciful world of clean cut espionage with a hint of tongue in cheek. Fresh is the keyword here.",Knight and Day

That did not take much away from the enjoyment, but to have seen them fresh would have been better. I do enjoy Tom Cruise when he is not trying to be serious. The character is, but the actor had fun with it. I will say that Diaz could have been replaced by another without much changing, but she did well enough with her part. Overall, a fun movie to see.

327,neens0,A cheap and tacky movie,4,22 November 2010,On the whole this movie was all a bit silly really. I felt the dialogue was poor; and jokes were used more than once which was pretty lame. The shots of Cruise/Diaz either in a car or on a bike looked fake. Didn't look like they were really on the vehicle - I thought that was all done in the 60's etc? I liked one joke but this has been used in the trailer so we all know it - they were really plugging this movie a sign it's not very good. As an Actor Cruise is not great - he has his niche and action movies is his thing. The action was pretty good; big explosions; big car chases etc. but I really must have a good storyline with some decent dialogue with it. This didn't deliver.There is zero realism in this; yes it's a movie but when it becomes so silly one has to take stock and think oh come on please...It's not awful but I was disappointed watching it - there is dialogue in the air plane which I found odd; and then there's the thing how Cruise takes down 500 men on his own on more than one occasion. Defo cheap and tacky - no substance in this movie whatsoever.,Knight and Day

I got the feeling that they had a real laugh making it - they have good chemistry on film. I'm going watching it again with my husband and I'll buy it on DVD when it comes out. I think the humour is brilliant and I think the drugging part is funny. I giggled throughout, as did a lot of other people in the cinema. I'm glad Tom Cruise did this film, he's funny. I went to the cinema today wanting an easy fun film and nothing too serious and that's exactly what I got.

Terrible ""witty"" dialogue that no one would say in real life, and a body count in the hundreds.However the main, huge, turnoff for me was the ""running joke"" of the Diaz character being drugged, undressed and dressed, to wake up in another country because ""she wasn't handling"" the carnage well. Drugging and dragging an unconscious woman without her permission and consent across borders is not ""romantic"", it's human trafficking. It just makes Tom Cruise and his movie character more creepy.As for the rest, imagine a joke told by someone with no sense of humor, and romance between two cardboard figures.

333,salterbach,Good comedy with great delivery of lines,7,22 June 2010,"I saw ""Knight and Day"" tonight at an advanced screening. I really liked it. For me, I considered it more of a comedy, rather than a thriller. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz have great chemistry, and did wonderful line deliveries of several running jokes. Their facial expressions, non-verbal actions, and then their unique line delivery - just made everything fit together into a delightful comedy. You will enjoy yourself and laugh out loud. Tom Cruise does a great job of reminding us why we like him as a performer and actor. (Recently, I think too many of us have been side-tracked by his off-camera non-PC comments and antics; so it's good to get back to the basics, that he really is a wonderful actor.) Cameron Diaz is funny, warm,beautiful, and spunky. I loved the way these two actors interacted with each other. Well done. I know another reviewer here kept dropping ""Oscar award winning"" several times - but for myself, I would not go that far.

Knight and Day was just the opposite. It felt good to be laughing at intelligent humor, not to be laughing at how bad someone is. I even found myself laughing at the same parts in the trailers I watched a dozen times. The plot and execution of the stunts and lines kept me involved until I unknowingly reached the punch line. Realizing what I had just witnessed had me joining in with the rest of the audience in laughter. Totally unexpected outcomes.I heard Tom Cruise does a lot of his own stunts and wondered how many he did in this movie. Many scenes looked like it was him in very dangerous situations. Some even with Cameron Diaz. I don't know how their insurance company could allow it.The plot had many twists and change ups that had me wondering to the end of the film. The movie is filled with these little details that crack you up in laughter. It is a movie that you could see several times and it would still keep you in stitches.

It ended up being great fun and a lot of laughs. So if you go see this movie knowing that it's just for fun and that it probably won't win any Oscars, I think you'll find it thoroughly enjoyable.Contrary to a few reviews I read, I thought everything made sense and was properly tied together. One review suggested that the initial airplane scene never told us why they were even on the plane in the first place.

The usual hyped up, over-rated actors with Tom Cruise playing the super hero action-man and Cameron Diaz, the fatally attracted blonde who becomes his action women. I'd rather watch Superman and Batman. At least we're under no illusions that they are fantasy.It's the usual, predictable tripe that's prevalent in movies these days. The hero can pilot planes, do motor bike stunts, race cars through buildings and against heavy oncoming traffic, firing guns, playing with computers and pulling stunts all at the same time. He always leaves a trail of destruction and dead bad men in his wake but never gets shot himself. At one point, about a dozen baddies with guns have the drop on him but he manages to joke with Diaz while killing them all and then gets away.

339,leanne-alessandra,my evaluation of the film,7,4 September 2010,"Alas yet another action-comedy has been made! However is it any good? Well, quite possibly yes. Having received mixed responses from other critics and generally scoring around 5/10 on most occasions, it is thought that many people may in fact enjoy it, although will not be impatient for it to come out on DVD, however it still should be seen. Directed by James Mangold, who also directed the award-winning 'Walk the Line,' the film is likely to have some good potential, which it does.The perhaps star-vehicle film stars none other than Mission Impossible lead Tom Cruise and Charlie's Angel Cameron Diaz who appear together on our screens for the second time after Vanilla Sky. Both stars can be seen as 'objects of desire' as on at least two occasions Cruise's top is off showing his fine, fit body and Diaz shows off her amazing body while in a bikini, thus making it a good film for couples to go and see as both would have someone to feast their eyes on.The film cleverly makes some spectators alternate their views on whether Cruise's character is the good guy or the bad guy. Making the spectator think can be an added bonus into creating a good film. However the film lacks the in depth detail of the main characters which could loosen a spectator's connection to the film, therefore making it a film more suitable for people who seek escapism from realism.Escapism is easily seen because of the large amounts of typically American action scenes such as gun fights, car chases and explosions, which added with the witty comedy, are shown pretty well and make it enjoyable to watch, which surprises me when I found that the film did better globally ($200 million, box office) than domestically. One explanation for this is that it couldn't compete with family orientated films such as, The Karate Kid and Toy Story 3 which both seemed to generally do better. On the other hand, The Karate Kid is a remake of the 80s classic and Toy Story 3 is the third in a series of films that is adored by many generations, so both would obviously seem more popular.Although the comedy element of the film doesn't make you laugh for hours on end, it is filled with many witty comments that keep the film light-hearted and keep it from becoming boring, and Diaz and Cruise create this well with the use of good chemistry.I personally rate the film with 7/10 as apart from the lack of character in depth, the mixture of wit, Cruise and Diaz, and amazing action sequences, create a great film for couples and families (particularly with teenagers) to watch.",Knight and Day
340,stchristoph2000,Highly underrated,9,19 September 2010,"I watched this movie not expecting a whole lot since the reviews were just average. However this movie turned out to be extremely enjoyable. The clichés are stylistically placed and exaggerated in a funny way. The action sequences, which there are quite a few of, are very well done. Also this movie never got boring. There was always something going on. Repetitive sequences were fast-forwarded in a clever way and everything just seemed to fit. The romantic scenes were kept to an enjoyable limit and the main focus was on the story, action and comedy part of the movie which I found to be a welcome chance to the typical action romantic movies.I must say this was one of the best movies I've seen this year.I highly recommend it to everyone who enjoys action and comedy movies.",Knight and Day
341,rmrdenovic,Mission: Impossible with romantic twist,7,2 August 2010,"I think this movie was very entertaining and easy to watch. The genre is action romantic comedy. This movie will not make you think, it will not make you admire the storyline or the script as the story does not bring anything new to the genre. However, this movie will entertain you, it will make you laugh and it will connect you with the lead characters (well played by Cruise and Diaz). This is a good example of a summer blockbuster movie which achieves its purpose, entertainment. Maybe you are wondering how this movie did not score a lot at the box-office since it is fun and has two major stars acting in it. I think the reason is simple, recent decrease in popularity of its lead actor due to his statements covered by the media. If this was not the case this movie would easily earn over 150m $ in the US.The lead actors, however, have good chemistry between them and this is what the whole movie depends on. Although they are making movies pretty long time they handle their roles with enthusiasm typical for younger actors. Well done Cruise and Diaz. And last but not least, director James Mangold who has a line of good movies behind him contributed significantly to make this movie fun and easy to watch. However, this movie cannot be considered to be one of his greatest achievements since he also made Identity, 3:10 to Yuma, Walk the Line etc, Maybe best way to describe the movie would be to say this is Mission: Impossible with a romantic twist to it.

Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz are obviously having a blast, and anytime they are on screen, the movie's energy and fun level pegs the meter.

This isn't a traditional spy movie or action thriller; it's not a traditional rom-com and it's not a spoof. It is hard to categorise and I think that has contributed to some of the poor reviews. People expecting either fish or fowl will have found that this film failed to live up to their expectations. For my money, Knight and Day was exactly what I wanted for a quiet summer weekend: a gentle, giggly, ditsy summer comedy with laughs, action, romance and two charming protagonists. I particularly liked the fact that Cruise and Diaz were older and not your usual rom-com 20- somethings. I will be buying the DVD to add to my collection of feel-good mood- lifters.",Knight and Day
348,cupidsarrow11,The Ultimate Date Movie! Cruise and Diaz shine!!!,8,23 July 2010,"Knight And Day is such a feel-good movie! I would say that this is the BEST date movie that I have been to in, like, forever! It's one of those great, old-fashioned escapades that has action, suspense, romance, rapid-fire humour, breathtaking locations, and two gorgeous, lovable lead characters. Director James Mangold has shot it with a classy elegance that recalls uber-romantic Cary Grant films (except for the CGI and explosions, of course), such as North By Northwest with Eva Marie Saint, or To Catch A Thief with Grace Kelly). Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz bring true, classic Movie Star panache to a genre that has recently suffered through the likes of The Bounty Hunter and Killers. Amongst those low-wattage duds, Knight And Day shines as something infinitely superior, with a much sharper, wittier script. Just pure fun! Sit back and enjoy! No movie this season has had me leaving the cinema with this big of a smile on my face! I'm 21 and a girl, so I REALLY appreciate a decent, proper date movie, because we don't have many of them anymore. So I urge all couples from teens to 80-yr-olds to see this movie together. Or if you have been crushing on a special him or her, this is the perfect first date! It will leave both of you in SUCH a good mood. Anyway, I think I am rambling now, but this movie totally deserves Cupid's Arrow of Approval (hey, I like that!) For this genre, and unless I wanted to get into SERIOUSLY minor nitpicks, then I honestly can't fault K&D as wonderful escapist entertainment. The comedy is genuinely funny, the performances are dynamite, and the action is rip-roaring! Highly recommended!",Knight and Day
349,FutureAuthoress,Average...but enjoyable,6,19 June 2010,"Let me just preface this review by saying that I like Tom Cruise.There, I said it. I think that he's done some great movies in the past (A Few Good Men, Mission Impossible, Tropic Thunder) and that he can be a pretty good actor if you get him in the right role. Sure, the guy might be a little kooky, but I have no interest in his personal life as long as he makes good movies.Cruise and Diaz star as Roy Miller and June Haven in Knight and Day (2010. The movie is average. It's predictable. Anyone who has ever seen a spy thriller will be able to predict the plot: Guy Meets Girl, They Fall in Love, Guy Must Recover MacGuffin, Bad Guy Does Bad Things, Guy Recovers MacGuffin. It's gotten to the point where the only thing directors are able to do to set their movies apart is to make the dialogue entertaining or to have the special effects go BOOM instead of just bang.And the dialogue in Knight and Day is certainly entertaining. The light, comedic banter is enjoyable, and the running gags throughout the movie (Cameron Diaz's character getting drugged, for example) spice up the relatively standard fare. The movie is kept low-key, and doesn't try to be more than it is. It's family friendly, with only a few chaste kisses and a F-bomb dropped. You'll certainly be entertained, if not surprised.And if you didn't like it, well...at least you got to see Tom Cruise with his shirt off.",Knight and Day

Everything he did I saw him do better in MI 1, 2, 3, and 4. Car chase scenes and motor cycle chase scenes were lame. Running across roofs and faking deaths, I've seen done before and recently. And Cameron Diaz does not come close to Paula Patton's performance as his female lead in MI 4. I cannot figure out why she feels anything for him at the end. It looks like they were trying to rekindle some good scenes they had together in Vanilla Sky 12 years ago. The it was original, now it is just boring. I'm glad I did not spend $10 or $12 dollars on this one. Don't waste your time. See one of the MIs instead.",Knight and Day

I prefer not knowing anything & I simply wish to be surprised. This film did the trick.Knight & Day has an excellent flow & kept me guessing. It began it ended & it took me for a ride.Knight and Day is a date movie that gave a lot more to this action fan than expected. I was reminded of Top Gun but Knight and Day is its own film & Is certainly more feminine.My first impression was that Knight & Day is a kind of YIN & YANG story. The theme plays a lot on this kind of drama, it does it well & it has good balance.It is a movie for the newer generation & may be a bit too complex or 'boring' for some. The action is traditional, but the plot is new. If you enjoy cartoons & video games, you may get a kick out of this movie.If you aren't afraid of violence & enjoy being emotionally responsive, definitely watch this movie! If YOU enjoy Anime & don't want to see this movie, squash the cinema aspect into 1:1 (makes it TOONY)",Knight and Day

Sure there were some entertaining action sequences throughout the film but the overall experience is dampened by corny punchlines and physically impossible stunts that leave you wondering whether this was done intentionally. James Mangold (the director) has dropped the ball this time around, which is truly disappointing considering the phenomenal direction he delivered in Cop Land and 3:10 to Yuma.Bottom Line: If you are bored and have nothing better to do then feel free to waste your time watching this flick, like i did.",Knight and Day
355,denver5357,Like Watching News from the Early 90s,4,14 July 2010,"You know going in that the plot of ""Knight and Day"" will have huge holes and at the same time will be utterly predictable. But you go anyway, because it looks like fun.And it might have been fun, except the two leads - Cruise and Diaz - really show their age in this constant action flick. Oh, they look good, and the movie offers a couple of gratuitous shots just to give them a change to show us they still have nice bodies. But their faces - especially Diaz's - and the simple fact they are in their 40s belies their silly actions.For the first half of the movie, Cruise has an answer for everything while Diaz screams like a lost 8-year-old. If she were in her 20s, that might work. In her 40s, she reminds me of those divorced women of that age who insist on sharing clothes with their horrified teen daughters.Inexplicably, in the second half of the movie Cruise makes blunder after blunder (including failing to check his unconscious island guest for a cellphone and being beat up by a bad guy on a train) while Diaz becomes an at first accidental and then purposeful hero. Also inexplicable, given we have seen no evidence that Diaz's character would ever be capable of this.There is a lot of mugging by Cruise as the movie tries to make him come across as winningly charming. Most of the time it is more like he is a looney toon who most people would run from immediately.In the end, ""Knight and Day"" felt like a movie that would have been better if it had been made 10-15 years ago, when its stars were younger, the world a nicer place and the audience less sophisticated.",Knight and Day

It was funny, exciting, romantic, action filled and I thought both of the lead actors were wonderful together. There is nothing negative or critical to say. Casting, story, character build up and everything else was perfect. The showing we went to was completely full, so even though the movie has been out for a while, it is still drawing in viewers. I loved it and might even go see it again at the movies. Tom Cruise looks almost as good as he did in Top Gun. How many years ago is that? And although he may have some strange beliefs as an individual, he is as charming and charismatic as ever on screen. I (52), my daughter (29) and my other daughter (17) all agreed, he's hot and he must sleep in Tupperware.Cameron Diaz's stunning blue eyes, beautiful smile and comedic personality shines through. What a great match. Her character develops from a somewhat clueless innocent to a powerful woman role model. Thank you for that.

357,valentinavaselli-1,light and funny entertainment - perfect summer comedy,9,9 August 2010,"I've been to the cinema last week with my husband and sister in law, we are 30 and she is 20: while we were very much up for having a look on Diaz last movie, she wasn't very keen on the movie trailer and most of her skepticism was on the presence of Tom Cruise. After a week, we are all the 3 still laughing repeating some quotations from this comedy, so I was very surprised to read later that it didn't went well on the box office in US, so I hope it ll do well in Europe and elsewhere as the script has lot of nonsense but it is written to make you laugh, not to deliver a real action movie.Cruise, after the funny cameo in Tropic Thunder, carries on the way of taking some distance from himself and deliver a self ironic portrait of hero but is Cameron Diaz the sun around which the comedy engine works. There are a lot of scenes that reminds famous scenes and typical situations of American movies: perhaps the American average audience didn't realize that these hints were made as parody, not as mere recycling . Having seen this movie in original language version in an international city full of expats from every corner of the world, I can tell you the whole room (500 seats) was laughing constantly. I rate it 9 not because its a masterpiece of the history of the cinema, but as a comedy it delivers very good fun and if you are looking to watch a movie to have some relax this is a safe choice!",Knight and Day

360,minombreesashley,Knight and Day,7,2 August 2010,"Although I'm used to seeing IMDb have equally divided crowds, the ""This movie sucks!"" crowd's justification is basically it having crappy effects and being far too predictable. Personally, I think both aspects made the film what it is. (I think there might be spoilers ahead. Oh well.) The movie's practically a tribute to old secret agent films. The special effects are crud. Tom Cruise meets people in dark alleys and jumps from car to car without receiving so much as a bruise. His bullets never run out. He whips out what are probably illegal substances from non-existent pockets. Bad European men are going after something with a nifty name that starts with a Z made by a young genius, as a well a double agent who framed our beloved protagonist. It's got a happy ending and the guy gets the girl. Sound familiar? Of course, the movie does have it's original aspects and some nice jokes, which are brilliantly delivered by Tom and Cameron, but it wouldn't have been half as great had it not been so campy and impossible.Go watch this if you want two hours of giddiness and fun.",Knight and Day

Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise had good chemistry which I think, made the film. Cameron did a great job portraying her part in the film. She had amazing realistic and yet clever reactions to the circumstances happening around her. My main concern was the quality and computer graphics. There were a lot of scenes that stood out to me as fake which disappointed me. One scene, the main characters (Tom and Cameron) were riding a motorcycle through a huge wood door. They busted through it, but before then you can see a quite noticeable outline where the door was pre-cut so they could break through it easier. Not to mention after they broke through the door the hole was in a perfect rectangle. With that, I am displeased. I did expect more from the action scenes.",Knight and Day

The first trailer I saw for this movie did the best job of foreshadowing the theme, which is fun and entertaining without taking itself seriously; however, I later saw trailers that cast the movie more seriously and want viewers to know this is NOT a serious action flick. It is a fun and entertaining ride that has it's slow moments but is packed full of great dialog that is laugh out loud funny at times. Unlike many movie goers out there, I don't carry preconceived impressions of actor's personal lives into the theater. Tom Cruise plays his role amazingly and really carries the movie with his serious humor. As long as you walk into the movie expecting loads of over the top, well choreographed action and spot on humor you will walk away satisfied, all in all it is a fun watch worth seeing.",Knight and Day

Both Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise were at their best and they look great. Hard to believe Tom Cruise did all his own stunts. At times Cameron Diaz reminded me of Goldie Hawn in her old, funny movies.

After being surprised by the Valkryie, I was expecting ""Knight and Day"" to finally put to rest the doubts about Cruise's comeback from the Ophra embarrassment. Sadly, there are serious flaws everywhere in this movie. The plot is erratic, nonsensical, cheap and not very funny. Fortunately, this movie is way short.

I've went back to see Knight & Day multiple times in theater because I've enjoyed it so much.

That said, Diaz and Cruise have no chemistry. I had a hard time seeing them as a couple, and for me, they both came across as desperate to prove they are still young (really?), hot, and exciting. I kind of felt embarrassed for them. Maybe a bit overacted. I don't know, something was wrong here, would have been more endearing for me if Cruise made fun of his age a bit, like Harrison Ford did back in the fantastic Indiana Jones. Would have worked even better with a younger actress.I guess he has a hard time admitting he is older and needs to embrace it a bit, and Diaz was just bad casting, should have been someone along the lines of Scarlett Johansson, she would have rocked it.",Knight and Day

Paul blends well with Cruise and Diaz. This never happens to me but I didn't want the movie to end. When has that ever happened to you. Don't believe the hype. It is a fun film.

The plot may be a bit predictable but great acting by Cruise and Cameron makes us forget this flaw. Cruise and Cameron should work on more movies, maybe a sequel if this movie makes good returns or any other action comedy because of the great chemistry. The action sequence are really good and Cruise makes all those stunts look so easy yet we know how difficult and dangerous it might have been....got to respect Cruise for doing most of the stunts.

374,dagg0405,Completely Soulless,2,27 July 2010,I have only registered with IMDb in order to warn you of this terrible film. I have used IMDb for many years and have never felt strongly enough about a film to write a review but this piece of garbage has got me going. There is so little feeling that I am wondering if Cruise and Diaz might in fact be robots programmed with the script.The action scenes (most of the film) are fairly good; hence the score of two but even the action has no hope of saving this piece of drivel. After the titles have rolled the impression is left that no one involved with the making of this mindless trash gave a damn; certainly not the director or either of the two leads. It is a pastiche of chase scenes without anything meaningful to glue it together. It is neither thriller nor comedy (definitely not comedy) and completely lacks any heart.As you can probably tell I was bitterly disappointed with this rubbish and strongly recommend that you keep away.,Knight and Day
375,harrik04,A Throwback to the Strong but Not Silent Type,8,27 July 2010,"Covert agent Roy Miller (played by Tom Cruise) yells to June Havens (played by Cameron Diaz): ""with me your life expectancy is up here, without me it's down here!""The film Knight and Day (directed by James Mangold) is an action-packed comedic espionage drama. Identifying a theme in this film was difficult at first due to the comedic tone. However, it is clear to me that this film shows that anyone can become confident and strong through association. I believe that the title of this film should have been An Ode to Machismo. Roy Miller is a character that truly pays homage to the tough guys of old. He is a shoot first and ask questions later type individual with an extraordinary wit, charm and fighting skills.As I watched this film I could not help but notice how similar it was to Eraser. In that film, U.S. Marshal John Kruger (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) has to protect Dr. Lee Cullen (played by Vanessa Williams) and is ultimately betrayed by his own organization. And like agent Roy Miller, he has to go on the run to seek retribution and at the same time protect the damsel in distress. Both films demonstrate that when you associate with a strong confident individual it can rub off on you. Throughout the film Knight and Day, June Havens is docile and dependent on agent Roy Miller. And like Dr. Lee Cullen she eventually begins to assert herself and finds her inner warrior.There are two scenes in the film that truly shows the growth of June Havens and how she transitions from being a damsel in distress (traditional role of women in action films) to a co-equal partner (modern role of women in action films) to agent Roy Miller. In the first scene, Roy Miller and June Havens are cornered by assassins who are trying to take them out. Roy Miller gives June a weapon and when she attempts to fire the weapon, gun fire erupts all around her and she panics and runs back to agent Miller. Eventually, agent Miller leaps into action and outfoxes the assassins and keeps her safe. However, there is another scene in the film where Roy Miller and June Havens are on a motorcycle fleeing from assassins and June acrobatically turns on the motorcycle snatches two pistols from Roy Miller and as he injects the two clips into them she fires the pistols and takes them out.Dr. Lee Cullen does a similar thing when she has a shootout with a team of assassins in the midst of crocodile tanks. She holds her own until U.S. Marshal John Kruger shows up at the last minute and the both of them defeat the assassins together. In each case both women found their inner warrior and confidence due to association. Knight and Day is a must see for those who would like to see a hybrid between the traditional and modern action flick.",Knight and Day
376,jaypatel081,"A movie that thought it could, but couldn't",2,8 September 2010,"That One with Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise This movie is packed full of action and has plenty of one-liners to lighten the mood as we watch Cameron Diaz struggle to find out who Tom Cruise really is and whose side he's on. Or so the trailers would have us believe. This movie is one of the worst I have seen not only this summer but ever. Going to this movie I wasn't expecting a deep engaging movie that would leave me pondering the intricacies that I may have missed, but I was expecting a good action movie. After seeing the trailers, which consist almost entirely of car chases or fight scenes and explosion I naturally assumed this was going to be a movie filled with spectacular action sequences. Unfortunately the action scenes in the trailers are all the action scenes in the entire movie. There are many more scenes where you begin to wonder how Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise will get away from the bad guys that have them surrounded and outnumbered which could become action scenes. But instead of having an action scene Tom Cruise drugs or knocks Cameron Diaz out and the screen goes black. The next thing you see is Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz in some peaceful location. Apparently Tom Cruise is able to defeat or escape the bad guys while pulling Cameron Diaz's unconscious body along, but we don't get to see these amazing feats instead we get a black screen. The trailers also included some slightly humorous lines but nothing I thought would lead this to be considered a comedy, but seeing as it has been tagged as one I feel it necessary to say that this was about as funny as it was action packed. The occasional joke was enough to lighten the mood slightly but it never was enough to make and serious contribution to the movie. Some people may claim that this movie was a parody of spy and action movies. This has some merit because the black screens during the fight scenes could be seen as a parody of the ridiculous nature of action scenes where the hero is completely outnumbered but they still get away unscathed. Unfortunately this is really the only parody in the movie there are still many action movie fallacies that are incorporated into the movie and not commented on. If this was truly a parody of action movies it should have parodied more than just one element of action movies, there are plenty such as guns that never need to be reloaded and that bullets can cause almost anything to blow up. Instead these other flaws in action move logic are integral parts of the movie. ""Knight and Day"" also lacked character development except in the devolving relationship between June Havens, Cameron Diaz, and Roy Miller, Tom Cruise, and there was too much of a focus on this. The motives of the bad guys never were clearly explained and occasionally Cameron Diaz would switch from a ditsy blonde who can't count to three to an action hero who can cause a car to flip with a few shots. This change is never explained and they make it feel as if half of two movies were cut up and pasted together.""Knight and Day"" about a woman, June Havens, who gets accidentally involved in an internal government conflict. June crosses paths with Roy Miller, a spy, who has a special battery and she has to help him protect the battery and its creator. None of this was even mentioned in the trailer even the main character's name were mentioned only once or twice in a three-minute trailer. Even in the movie the plot seems to be an aside. This movie relied on people to go and see it mostly because it had two big stars in it not because the movie seemed interesting. Other movies, like the expendables, use this tactic to drawn audiences in. The big names aren't used only to get people in but are also used to increase the positive reaction to the movie. Having big names in the movie seems to make people say that they enjoyed a movie just because it has an actor they like in it and they don't want their favorite actor to have ever been apart of something subpar. This movie had the potential to be a good action movie or a parody of action movies, but it tried to be both and a romantic comedy yet it was none of the three. I would never recommend you watch this movie, Knight or Day.",Knight and Day
377,mcscowsailor,Really???,1,3 December 2010,"I love Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise but really? This movie was so unbelievable and the storyline was completely...well...lame! I wouldn't even recommend this as a renter. I am a big fan of fast paced action movies but this was just ridiculous. Life is short, don't waste your time on this flick!!!!Seriously...I can't believe that I am still typing for this wasted time of a movie. IMDb is forcing me to type a minimum of ten lines for a review. This after I registered on the site just to warn people of how bad a movie Knight and Day is. Honestly the headliners in this flick draw a crowd but don't be duped!",Knight and Day
378,sunneykw,Much better than I thought it would be,8,1 January 2011,"I watched the trailers to ""Knight and Day"" a couple times, and it looked so dumb. The previews really didn't do it justice and because of that, I wasn't planning on seeing this movie at all. Then my parents bought it for Christmas and my family wanted to sit down and watch this movie. I decided to watch it, just to get it over with. After watching ""Knight and Day"", I must say it is a really good action movie. It's got a great plot, great characters, and is very clean, which you don't see in very many Hollywood movies anymore. It's definitely a movie I would watch over and over again. I would highly recommend ""Knight and Day"" to anyone.",Knight and Day
379,xclusivekrean,Knight and Day,10,11 February 2011,It was funny a little dramatic and romantic and a whole lot of action. It is a must see for action lovers. It has a great plot. It has enough time and suspense in there. It also has irony foreshadowing and there are so many scenes with different places. Whats funny is June and Roy together that make such a great pair. I don't want to spoil any of this but I will just tell you how great it is. There is so many genres in it Romance Comedy Action Drama Adventure and thriller. They picked the perfect characters for the movie. Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise they are action people and look great together. They spark on the screen. Its so good I just hope they have a sequel for Knight and Day!,Knight and Day
380,Bennickharding,A little far fetched,4,27 December 2012,"Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz work well together, their movie history is proof of that, and this action is no exception (although the production team must work hard to make TC appear taller than Cameron given he's 5cm shorter!). Their on screen chemistry is evident in this flick too. Going in with an open mind, I did find this action entertaining, however, I think there were a little too many scenes that are a bit over the top. From riding around on top of cars at high speed (miraculously not falling off) to some over the top gun fire. You know when you think ""how can the bad guys fire that many bullets without hitting someone?"" - that happens more in this movie than all others put together. Not a terrible watch, but you can do better.",Knight and Day
381,blackstrong,Entertaining Enough,6,1 October 2020,"Watch this movie to compare with other, better movies of this genre. Also watch to compare these actor performances to their better stuff. Everyone in this movie needs a nose job, BTW. Hollywood cosmetic surgeons must have been on strike in 2009 or something.",Knight and Day
382,lunson,"Relaxing, Fun, a very entertaining movie (Don't miss it)",9,11 January 2014,"I saw that this movie had a 6.1 vote only. I was so close to missing out on this movie due to the votes.First off, to the people that dislike this movie. Some say they smile too much, some say its ridiculous. There are movies that are very logical and makes perfect sense in a real world, there are movies where they don't show that much of an actors smile, there are movies where there's a lot of blood & horror. But you'll have to understand, this is a COMEDY.If you haven't watched it yet, I really recommend watching. Don't be picky and try to be too critical, relax yourself, and just let the movie take you.IMO: The votes did this movie a lot of injustice. Relax and have a good time! enjoy the movie =)",Knight and Day
383,qgr14,A thoroughly enjoyable romantic-comedy-action-thriller.,9,17 December 2012,"A simple story, strong performance from two veterans, and the result is an excellent movie. While the plot has suspense, but you don't have to bang you head to understand it. More importantly, the story is free flowing and keeps you engaged till the very end.It's simple on the face of it, a woman bumped on a strange man, and strange things start happening. Some enjoyable action, some bust of comedies, a formula romance and to some extend, predictable suspense... so there's nothing much look for the script here. But then, at the end of the day, entertainment is the key, and the movie has plenty of that. Cameron Diaz was the center of the movie, and she did carry it brilliantly. Tom Cruise's actions were well crafted.Overall, this is just a movie that will light up your dull Saturday evening without having much expectation.",Knight and Day
384,carlin6580-679-396123,Worth watching,8,20 July 2014,"Great blend of action and comedy. I never felt that the humor and the small bit of romance (that they had to throw in to make the relationship between the two protagonists believable) detracted from the action. It seemed that every time I was about to think ""when's the next action scene"" the movie would stop the thought with a well timed laugh or another action sequence making me never feel like I was waiting for the story or the action to resume.It was also refreshing to see Tom Cruise play a part that wasn't meant to be almost completely emotionally impotent. I've never before seen him play a character where his face actually SHOWED such a full spectrum of emotions. Cameron Diaz also runs a gamut of emotional and psychological states as she progresses from the sheltered, Midwestern blonde who's in way over her head to the semi-savvy (albeit awkward) companion/sidekick of a rogue spy trying to clear his name. I found myself applauding at the end.",Knight and Day

386,paco1957,absurd!,2,27 February 2011,"anyone that watches this...and has a minimum of culture and education, has to walk away saying it is for idiots. Sevilla Spain.....great city, but having the running of the bulls (san Fermin Pamplona Spain) there is like watching a cowboy in Kenya or a Pyramid in Alaska! give me a break.....what lack of respect towards another culture. stupid and not credible...NOT Fun at all! The acting, or lack of it, is another ""compliment"" to this disaster. Cruise is back?....yep to the back of the line of mediocre actors showing his abs. Cameron Diaz....she is better off feeding her love interest popcorn than having an acting career.....you are getting old my friend...time to settle down and have a kid or something.",Knight and Day
387,andyj4077,Best movie I've seen this year,9,11 August 2010,"Not just the best action-comedy but the best movie so far this year. Cruise and Diaz had chemistry and excellent timing. Comic timing and good, funny gags - laugh out loud - and most of the audience did. The audience was a good mix of ages, so this one looks like it'd be a good family film too. The supporting cast was good too.The plot was simple but had interest and made sense. The action scenes were impressive and reasonably original. There's movie violence, but it's tongue in cheek stuff, convincing enough but not gory.It was thoroughly enjoyable, fast paced without being frenetic, good humoured and left a smile on my face when it was over. I recommend it unreservedly.",Knight and Day
388,rebecca-halldoff-us,Great entertainment,8,2 December 2013,"I was really surprised by this movie! I had seen the trailer and didn't really feel like it was worth watching and I had heard pretty bad things about it. But when I did end up seeing it, I really enjoyed it. It has some great action scenes in it that were very well made. I also love the Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz combo! I think they have great chemistry together. It was a very funny movie, something I did not expect at all. I thought the jokes were going to be boring and dry, so I was surprised when the movie actually made me laugh, and a lot too! The jokes were funny and you didn't see them coming. I definitely recommend it! A fun movie to watch and great entertainment for two hours!",Knight and Day

390,Maryamegan,Knight and Day is an action filled comedy with elements of sexiness! He takes his top off *wink wink*,9,10 October 2014,"Knight and Day was a really great film. I bloody loved it. From the moment they meet to the moment it ends the film had me on the edge of my seat. I just wanted them to be romantically linked and the tension and my anxiety throughout the movie paid off when their lips met. Well, I think they kissed, I watched it 4 years ago.. :) Tom Cruise's motorbike was amazing and even 4 years later I still wish he could take me on a ride. Cameron Diaz is a lucky woman! Knight and Day is a good movie. Watch it ... or die Hehe...P.s Love ya Tom!",Knight and Day
391,AnorexicHeMan,Tom Cruise never ceases to please...,8,25 June 2010,"James Mangold, of 3:10 to Yuma fame, delivers a great action thriller with comedy blended evenly throughout. The entertainment level of this movie is high, in that it keeps you on your toes, ready for the action to hit once again. In ways, a roller coaster of excitement drawing from the style of the old Bond films with smooth spy swagger which is then shattered with huge action sequences and gratifying comedic elements.Knowing that the fate of Mission Impossible 4, in a way, relies on Knight & Day's Success I very much hope for others to enjoy this movie as much as I did. Action and intrigue woven throughout a comedic tale of trust and mistrust. Tom Cruise slips in and out of this movie as a spy-agent with ease, sharing the spotlight with Cameron Diaz who plays the beautiful but confused blond. The story centers around Diaz's character June figuring out Roy's life and as their lives begin to intertwine with both comedic dialog and often times almost over the top action sequences, we learn that Roy is on the run and must figure out a way to prove to Diaz's character that he is innocent. The plot is fast paced and makes for dreamlike tale of confusion and comedy as the story takes its twists and turns. All in all, the character's interactions were satisfying and enjoyable. By any means this is not an AMAZING film but I thoroughly liked it because of the way it drew me in, solved my intrigue and tied everything up nicely. Very much a thrill ride of pleasing comfort, with many exciting twists along the way.A recommended film, you will be entertained.",Knight and Day
392,stephen_j_foy,Cruise and Diaz elevate this above your typical action movie,8,29 June 2010,"You can't help but like Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz in this movie. For all you Tom Cruise haters out there, get over it. He's a good actor and his recent roles (including this one) are proof. His character is an intense, lethal killer, yet also disarmingly charming. Cruise pulls this off marvelously. Diaz also has her share of critics, but she is perfectly cast- slightly quirky, yet utterly beguiling, and sexy in a feminine, vulnerable way. Tom (along with most of the male audience) is instantly attracted to her. You want these two to succeed, not only in the many life and death situations they find themselves in, but also as a couple. The developing romance is predictable, but fun to watch. This occurs against a backdrop of wall-to-wall action which is typical Hollywood over the top. At least the action is well done and Cruise does it in a style worthy of the best James Bond movies. All the action, special effects, and exotic locations add up to a big budget. What's ironic is that if they focused more on Cruise and Diaz they could have saved some money and ended up with a stronger movie. That's how much chemistry these two bring to Knight and Day and what elevates it above the typical action movie.",Knight and Day
393,stagebat,Light Fun filled Spy thrills,6,25 June 2010,"I went into this movie with a optimistic attitude from what I had seen in the trailers, The chemistry between Cruise and Diaz is evident from the get-go and the banter between these two is the saving grace for this movie. But the plot for this Action/Romantic Comedy is paper thin, the film does not stray to far from any guidelines you would have seen before. It's all a little to well polished and as an audience you feel like you are watching a collection of scenes you have seen in a handful of other movies. Every action cliché is thrown at you from a hero that is cool in any situation, shady government agency's, to charismatic arch villains with armies of henchmen that never seem to hit what they are shooting at. Luckily the movie seems to not take it self to seriously and this light fair is bound to entertain.",Knight and Day
394,mortimerplantagenet,Non-stop Action Adventure with Romance,9,14 July 2010,"Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz are great together. A small town girl, June (Cameron Diaz), bumps into a renegade CIA agent and is drawn into his schemes. Without knowing whether or not she can trust him she falls for him and follows him deeper into his troubles. The story goes from the United States to Europe and to South America. From one scene to the next she likes him, but doesn't know if he's good or bad. The action is non-stop and exhausting, but fun. The chemistry and humor between Roy (Tom Cruise)and June (Cameron Diaz) is fun and addictive to watch and continues throughout the whole movie. Cameron and Cruise make a great working team. This movie was great fun!",Knight and Day
395,leflermt,Pure Entertainment!,10,4 January 2021,"This movie delivers exactly what it was designed to deliver. Beside the fact that one man could be that much better than multiple highly trained men is a bit unrealistic, but this film feeds the part of your brain that wants to believe in a hero that is almost super human and truly righteous in his pursuit of justice. Roy is discplined, concise, intelligent, and pure if heart. You cannot buld a better human. In fact, this is the hardest part to swallow. I lived the film because it delivered what I wanted from it and the actors were perfect in their portrayal of these individuals that needed each other for more than just survival. Excellent story, acting, and cinematography!",Knight and Day

Go watch it now ! *** *** This is not a long review, it just looks long ***** Knight: l'm not one of those ''l told you so'' kind of guys, but l did warn you to stay off the plane last night.Day: When? Knight: Well, when l said, ''Sometimes things happen for a reason.""Day: That's not a warning, Roy! That's like a needlepoint expression or a bumper sticker.Day: Next time, try, ''June, if you get on this plane, you will f*c*ing die! '' **Action-Comedy genre has become so overrated with all those preposterous wannabes proliferating in. Really how many movies would you tag as Action-Comedy? 5 maybe 6. What actors come to mind when you hear Action-Comedy? 3 or 4 good names? In reality its very hard to make a Action-Comedy Click (unless you are Jackie Chan or something).I walked into this movie with no prior knowledge of reviews, word-of-mouth. I was pleasantly surprised. This is a good Rom-Com-Action movie. It brought me back memories of a great Action-Comedy: True Lies (1994).It took about 10 mins into the movie to understand the movie name. -Opposites Attract- She is the Damsel in distress and He is the Knight in shining armour. She likes to be rescued by him (or is that armour shining after all?). He is drowned in the night, begins to see the day when around her. -No, scratch that last line.** Knight: What day is it today? Day: It's ""someday""! Knight: Someday. That's a dangerous word. It's really just a code for 'never'. **There are a lot of sutle information in the movie. I like that. Thanks to the Director and Writer for not spelling out each and every information, we have brains too. Since its high paced, we have to watch it twice to get some through. Like what is Knight's real name? Its M.K., his mom spells it out :) Go watch the movie again !! Its really high paced with heavy scene jumps. I bet the Director and Choreographer designed it this way. They have Brains too you know. Take this scene jump:-** Frame1: The Knight has fallen (Literally).Frame2: ""Did you secure the Kid? Yeah."" Frame3: Kid is led to a benz car (in front of, presumably, CIA building).Frame4: ""Did they find Roy? We'll find the body. We have to. He went down with the Zephyr."" Now, she is led to a beautiful black Benz.Frame5: She wakes in a turbulent airplane, turns right. (obviously looking for the Knight) Frame6: She wakes up in bed.Frame7: She's in the yellow dress again, waving and smiling at Rodney. (I bet you noticed the girl in the black dress stooping towards Rodney). (Has he moved on with the new found fame?) Frame8: Her sister is married. She hugs her. Rodney bends down and picks up his Hat. **Mind you all this happens in exactly one minute. This movie is almost two hours, yet it feels like just one. Awesome high-paced movie. ** Day: With me, without me. With me, without me. Knight: With you. **Some movies to go along: Romancing the Stone (1984), Eraser (1996), True Lies (1994), The Peacemaker (1997), Salt (2010), Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005) . -Scratch the last one.Eagerly awaiting a next release. Possibility of more character development. Especially the father character Frank.K could pull some action.",Knight and Day
