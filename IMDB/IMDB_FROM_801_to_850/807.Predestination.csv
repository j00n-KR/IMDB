0,MartinHafer,"Very good, very dark and, perhaps, a bit confusing.",8,8 June 2020,"""Predestination"" is a very good sci-fi film. I enjoyed it very much, but I should warn you...it's very strange and a bit confusing. This doesn't mean it's bad...it has lots of neat twists and turns and is worth your time.
The film is about a temporal agent (Ethan Hawke) who is blown up, but not killed, at the beginning of the film. After extensive surgeries and rehabilitation, he is sent on another case....in order to recruit a new temporal agent. When he meets this future agent, John tells his life story...which is very sad and weird. But if you think this is weird...just keep watching!The acting, writing and direction are all very good. I also enjoyed Sarah Snook and her dual roles. There really isn't any other film like it...and I will wrap it up quickly, as I don't want to ruin it for you by revealing too much of the plot.",Predestination
1,Leofwine_draca,"Thinking man's - okay, person's - sci-fi thrills",6,3 May 2017,"PREDESTINATION is a thinking person's science fiction thriller that has more intelligence than a rival Hollywood effort like LOOPER. This talky Australian drama features strong performances from the two leads, Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook, and well it might as the entire delivery of the plot rests on their shoulders.It's a slow-burner at first, starting off well but then descending into an endless life story that seems to have little to do with anything. Stick with it, though, because it does all have a reason, and once the pieces of this crazy jigsaw start fitting together, it all comes together for a rather satisfying resolution. I wouldn't call it a perfect film - it's too low budget for that - but it does feel fresh and inventive, and you won't guess the outcome.",Predestination
2,SnoopyStyle,loopy time travel story,8,14 December 2015,"A Temporal Agent is trying to hunt down the Fizzle Bomber in the past before he devastates NYC in 1975. He fails and the bomb explodes in his face. After face reconstruction, he (Ethan Hawke) travels back to 1970 as a bartender. John (Sarah Snook) walks in claiming to write under the pen name The Unmarried Mother. Back in 1945 Cleveland, baby John was left at an orphanage as a girl they named Jane. She was different and smarter than the other girls. Mr. Robertson (Noah Taylor) recruits her into a mysterious government space program. It's actually a front for the time traveling agency.It's an original loopy take on time travel. It's literally loopy. What makes this more than a writing exercise are the two leads. Ethan Hawke is always a compelling lead and Sarah Snook is an amazing find. She does a gender bending role with emotions. This is definitely one of the stranger takes just when time travel stories seem to be oversaturated.",Predestination
3,Hitchcoc,The Worm Ouroboros,8,12 November 2015,"Sometimes it's hard to write about films that feature time travel. There are nearly always inconsistencies that rear their heads, having to do with mutability. Once I accepted this as more of a kind of parallel universe film, following the rules of that form, I really enjoyed this. There is something about Ethan Hawke, a kind of sincerity, that is quite engaging. He plays opposite an actress playing a character who has been through a sex change. He tells the story of being recruited because of his formidability as a young girl. Hawke is a time jumper who has a violin case with settings that allow him to go where he wants to go, although each time he jumps, he risks damage to mind and body. His purpose is to put a stop to people who will eventually commit horrid crimes, involving huge casualties. Once their paths cross, he attempts to recruit the young man/woman to work for his agency. It's not so simple because there is great unhappiness in this person and an unwilingness to let go of the past. This one is going to take a second viewing because I am somewhat confused by the shaping of events.",Predestination
4,Horst_In_Translation,"Mistaken identities, time travel and a terrorist threat",6,19 May 2015,"This is a 100-minute movie written and directed by the Spierig twins from Germany and it's not the first time they worked with Ethan Hawke. You have to pay full attention from start to finish to understand everything that is going on and if you are into the likes of ""Inception"", this is certainly a film you will enjoy. The female lead is Sarah Snook and I have to say I wasn't familiar with her before watching this, but she left a lasting impression and I can see why it seems her star is about to rise. After the first couple minutes and an introduction to who Hawke's character is and what he does, basically the first 60 minutes of the film is Snook's character sitting in a bar telling her life to Hawke's character. But then a lot happens real quickly and it's not always easy to keep track. So many questions: Is he the bomber? Is she the bomber? Is he the father of her baby? Is she herself the father of her baby? Who is Robertson? Can Hawke's character really be the bad guy? He mostly plays likable characters. How did he look before his face change early in the movie? Is the guy just making love happen between the two and will the story move into completely another direction for the rest of the movie? The ending will provide an answer to all these questions. I had so many thoughts running through my head while watching this that I cannot list them all here. One was that she was actually the fizzle bomber and it was Hawke's character's plan to set up a meeting in the past so she would actually kill herself. Well, that was not it I guess.I have to say, even if the second half is not as good as the first, this was a very delightful surprise. Maybe in the end, it was one plot twist too many, but there are quite a lot details in this film which made it very much worth the watch, like for example the story of her baby or the reference to her fertility. In terms of the time travel parts, it is always a smart way to explain a concept to the audience simply by explaining it to a less experienced character in the movie and this is exactly what was done here. Another thing I liked is that they kept it simple in terms of locations. There really aren't many of these, so it doesn't get too confusing and it helps in focusing entirely on and grasping the complicated story. Also, this is a film which is really worth watching a second or third time as you will probably always discover something you have not come across in previous sessions.",Predestination
5,Prismark10,I knew it was you,6,17 February 2016,"Robert Heinlein was a right wing science fiction writer whose beliefs seemed to have gained some traction with some right wing groups. The kind who believe citizenship should not be automatically given to people but be earned with all the rights that entail with it, just see the movie Starship Troopers whose adaptation actually gave Heinlein's politics the middle finger by the filmmakers who decided to be subversive to the book.Here his short story is adapted for the screen by the Spierig Brothers who make this topsy turvy low budget time travel film.The film starts off slowly as Ethan Hawke plays a bartender who gets into conversation with a man in a bar (who looks somewhat like Leonardo DiCaprio) in 1970.The Bartender is actually a time traveller on an assignment to stop the Fizzle Bomber who has been causing havoc for years and in 1975 will cause an incident that will kill thousands of people.The person he talks to is called The Unmarried Mother, a man who writes for women's magazines. The character is played by Sarah Snook and it is no surprise when he reveals that he was once a woman.The Unmarried Mother tells a bartender a tale but what is actually happening is that the tale merges with the plot of the film. The events and characters are all interlinked.Predestination like the film Looper gives an interesting slant on cause and effect and does so elegantly but there is a part of the plot which it skates over knowing that there is a potential plot hole.However once the film gets going it becomes intriguing and interesting. You kind of get to know where it is going once the filmmaker reveal their hand partway through the movie. It is enjoyable but some of it does not come off, despite Snook's efforts you know she is playing a female or transgender character. Hawke does well in keeping his motivation in check for a while into the film. Predestination is bound to attract a cult following.",Predestination
6,claudio_carvalho,Paradoxical Mess,3,26 November 2016,"It is hard to understand the hype surrounding ""Predestination"", maybe by people that has not understood the story but pose as intellectual; or maybe by people that wants to seem smarter or more intelligent than the others and easily satisfies themselves with a weak story of butterfly effect. The paradoxical story is indeed a complete mess and the screenplay is awful, spending a long period with the past of Jane and fast-paced later when the time travels are shown. A film that needs boards and forums to be discussed by countless viewers trying to find explanation proves how terrible the story and the screenplay are. The lovely Sarah Snook, from ""Jessabelle"", steals the show with a fantastic performance and is the best ""Predestination"" can offer. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""O Predestinado"" (""The Predestinated"")",Predestination
7,kosmasp,Point in time,9,21 February 2015,"Even if at some point you can see where this is going (and it is wicked indeed, in a good sense), it won't take too much away from the suspense or the general mood of the film. The Spierig Brothers directed this and they made a great unfortunately little seen movie. The story and the way it evolves is up there with other science fiction classic films, that have a complicated story as well.They bring ""back"" Ethan Hawke, who's as incredible as his female co-star. For some it might be hard to follow, for others very easy, but the different time-lines are necessary to make an impact on the viewer and it works like a charm. I generally avoid writing about the plot, but in this case you should avoid to read too much, to let it all flow in, while you watch the movie",Predestination
8,Tweekums,Intelligent time travel sci-fi,9,12 November 2021,"Agent Doe works for the Temporal Agency; an organisation that uses time travel to prevent certain occurrences. In particular he is determined to stop 'The Fizzle Bomber' who killed thousands in a bomb attack in New York in 1975. His latest attempted left him needing facial reconstruction and still didn't stop the bomber. When he recovers he is told he has one more attempt before mandatory retirement. Returning to the '70s he gets a job in a bar. One day a man walks in and they get talking; the man bets him that he has a story more amazing than any he has heard... it begins 'When I was a girl'. He tells the story of how that girl grew up become the man in the bar; it is a story full of disappointments, a shocking revelation and a significant betrayal. When it is over the barman offers to put the man in a position where he can kill his betrayer.When I saw this was a film about a time travelling law enforcement agent I assumed it would turn out to be rather similar to Jean-Claude Van Damme film 'Time Cop'... it turns out it is almost nothing like that. It is impossible to describe the story in much detail without giving too much away suffice to say
It was intriguing and kept me gripped from start to finish. As is often the case with time travel stories one has to be able to accept certain paradoxes and expect lots of twists. Some of these twists are less expected than others. The cast does a great job; Ethan Hawke impresses as Agent Doe but it is Sarah Snook who really stands out as the man telling his story and the girl who grew up to become him. Science fiction is often associated with a high budget and lots of action and special effects; this shows that if can be done well on a relatively small budget with the right story. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to sci-fi fans looking for something that is gripping but not full of action.",Predestination
9,blanche-2,"It gave me a headache, but I really liked it",7,28 November 2015,"I'm not going to say much about this film, ""Predestination,"" except to say that if you're interested in time travel films, this is a must- see.Ethan Hawke gives a terrific performance, as does Sarah Snook.The film deals with time travel, looping, time dimensions, and much more as an agent is charged with stopping a bomber in the past who is going to bomb 11 blocks of New York City and kill 11,000 people.I consider myself fairly intelligent, and I like time travel movies, but they have to be a lot simpler than this one in order for me to follow it. My idea of time travel is ""Back to the Future"" or ""The Time Machine.""I only had a partial idea of what this one was about. The very experienced viewers on Predestination's message board cleared up a few things.This film demands a second viewing. Intriguing and fascinating.",Predestination
10,Quinoa1984,"""The snake that eats its own tail, forever & ever...""",8,3 November 2015,"When it comes to time travel stories, you always have to expect that certain elements with the storytelling will get wonky or a little crazy. If one remembers Looper it's sometimes just difficult to talk about the subject (""Well be making diagrams with straws,"" was one of Bruce Willis' lines). But what happens if you take the paradox of time travel, of going back to a point in time when you saw things that you knew before - even see yourself - and it becomes a pivotal point of departure to see what it means to be just, uh, one with the universe? Predestination is quite possibly the weirdest time travel movie I've ever seen. It's deep down a well-made and crafted film, featuring one of Ethan Hawke's chances as an actor to dig in deeply into the moral molasses and questionable things when it comes to a person living a (to put it lightly) complicated life. Or lives. Or is it all one life? I could put the spoiler warning up, but if I went into spoilers with this story it would last like 10,000 words. Simple enough to say that this story starts off - after what seems to be a prologue where a character gets burned and then gets a face graft that makes the person come back as Ethan Hawke's character - in 1970 where a man comes into a dark bar at night and Ethan Hawke is the bartender. This man tells this story and it starts off with the words ""When I was a little girl."" This piques Hawke's interest; this man is actually a woman, played by Sarah Snook.Her/his story starts off with an orphan in 1945, a life with some extra strength in childhood and adolescence (a certain anger is there too, underneath the straight-A ideal student surface). Then she (""Jane"") is selected for a special program that seems to involve space travel... it turns out it's not, but that's something else. She's rejected due to a certain medical reason (you may see where it's coming by the he/she thing), and the story goes on from there involving a mystery man she meets/falls in love and has a child with, but the man has a) already left and b) the baby is taken. Lots of shady and heartbreaking things in this woman's life, all leading up to a new identity - a male persona, via surgery and hormones - and writing ""Unmarried Woman"" stories. But the proposition is simple: if you could go back to meet that man who did you wrong, would you kill him? Hawke poses this to Snook, she says absolutely, and away we go into time-travel-land.This first half of the story was really involving. At first I wasn't sure where it was going, but that's the key thing: you watch this story and the way the Sperig brother unfold every detail, from a baby girl found on an orphanage steps to becoming a male writer with a pseudonym in Manhattan, it's rich with character development (or at least observation, as to how one gets from here to there to there), and meanwhile Hawke's bartender watching and waiting to spring a piece of information he's been hiding that he knows of. I felt like I was in the hands of solid, rich storytellers who were relishing in telling a good story (from Robert Heinlein), and Snook is really astonishing here in making this a deeply emotional being. If this first third to half of the story was just what it was, I'd say it was a fantastic short brought to full life, with all of the outsider psychology and 'how-do-I-fit-in' character beats that make such a story so good.When it finally comes to the time travel story - Hawke reveals he's a special agent for an organization that's created time-travel (or temporal things, it's something like that) and that within a 54 year time frame from when time travel's been invented (1981, hey, it's science fiction after all) a person can travel, albeit with certain issues. Some of those figure their way into the plot, which also involves at the core (the sort of 'actiony' part, which gains traction in the last third) the destruction through a bomb of a large part of Manhattan in the 1970's. If I had any worry going into the movie it was the story would go into generic action movie territory - or, like Daybreakers, the previous film from the brothers, would have a concept that was awesome but not follow through in the run time - and that's not the case. What it IS, however, is absolutely, whole-heartedly weird and strange.Why it is is precisely why I can't even begin to go into spoilers. It involves the meeting in 1963 between Jane as a woman and her/his later journey back to that spot. But I can say that the twist (or is it a reveal) genuinely floored me. It should be enough to take me out of the movie, but at the same time it made me more intrigued to see where it would go from here. By the end of Predestination I was left with more questions than answers (perhaps, I might say, how hardcore science fiction usually should do), though it ends on a note where it's really uncertain about the main plot point, which feels as if the movie isn't done when it is.At least the final scene, which does involve (I can say without spoiling much) two Ethan Hawkes on screen from different time periods (and wildly varied hair), is massively entertaining and horribly dramatic (in a good way), and I think a lot of the effectiveness past the completely eccentric and warped thinking of how these two characters interact in the story comes down not just the Sperigs but the actors themselves.",Predestination
11,hitchcockthelegend,The one thing that this job has taught me is that truth is stranger than fiction.,8,14 May 2016,"Out of Australia, Predestination is directed by Michael Spierig and Peter Spierig (who also scores the music). The Spierig's also adapt the screenplay from Robert A. Heinlein's story ""All You Zombies"". It stars Ethan Hawke, Sarah Snook, Noah Taylor, Christopher Kirby and Madeleine West. Ben Nott is the cinematographer. If we throw up a simple synopsis for this pic, it's about a time travelling agent who goes back in time to stop a killer known as ""The Fizzle Bomber"" - whilst helping a trans-gender man who has just told him a fascinating and emotionally wrought story. But simple is not a word readily associated with the Spierig's deliriously complicated mind meld of a movie. The first half of film is the story being relayed by Snook to Hawke, and then the film spirals into a world of temporal loops and frazzled paradoxes. This demands the utmost attention from the viewer, a piece guaranteed to have you asking tricky questions, and also likely to have you rewinding some scenes for clarity - like I did!This is not an actioner, this is very cerebral and sedate in tone, adult science fiction that's as audacious as it is clever. Snook is quite simply outstanding, the various layers she gives to her characterisations grip with intensity and emotional heart tugs. Hawke once again is reassuringly great - in that how he doesn't need to overact, he recognises the tone needed here, whilst knowing it's wise to let his co-star take the main stage.Thematically the story blends its dizzying thoughts about time and its impact on the human race, with that of our basic human condition, that of identity. This is a very rewarding production for those who wont be popping off to make a cup of coffee during the viewing, it's hoped that in time this will garner more fans and be seen as something of a sci-fi gem. 8/10",Predestination
12,LeonLouisRicci,Sarah Snook Shines In This Twisted Time Travel Tale,8,18 April 2015,"If You Think about this Movie too much Your Head will Spin and Fly off Your Shoulders and Land at Your Feet. Then Where will You be? Two Places at Once. Welcome to Predestination.Christopher Nolan's Inception (2010) is like that. Just too Complicated to be Highly Entertaining and the Confusion/Frustration Factor sets in and Overwhelms. This is an Enjoyable Film if You can Buy the Premise. All Time Travel Movies ask for that Suspension of Disbelief. Some Work better than others. This one Works to a Point.Ethan Hawke is His Standard Every-Man Self as a Bartender/Time Traveler and is the Film's Fulcrum as He Listens to the Story Unfold by a Writer He meets at a Bar. Hawke is on a Mission to Find and Stop a Serial Bomber but He Pauses to Take the Time to Listen to a Weird Story.A Weird Story indeed. This Film has more Variations on the Twist than Chubby Checker. It's an extremely Complicated Tale, with a Modern Gender Identity Slant and You must pay Attention if You want to Keep Up. Good Luck.Sarah Snook is Outstanding and Her Talent is Stretched to the Limits of Reason-Ability in the Role. She will be a Force in the Future and is an Actress Destined for Super Star Status. Her Performance alone is Worth the Price of Admission. Adding to the Fun is the Production Design, SFX, and Makeup that are all Excellent for a Moderately Budgeted Film.Overall, if You can Buy Into the Paradoxes of Time Travel and Forget the ""What if I kill my Father?"" Type Questions, You're Likely to Enjoy this Heavy Headed Experiment. If You Can't there is No Way and its Best to Stay Away. In the End, and What an End it is, this is an Above Average Sci-Fi with a Great Deal of Introspection.",Predestination
13,grantss,Clever...maybe too clever,7,30 July 2015,"Clever...maybe too clever.A man, played by Ethan Hawke, is a ""Temporal Agent"", traveling back and forth in time to change events. More particularly, he is on the track of the ""Fizzle Bomber"", a person responsible for the deaths of thousands of people in a several-year span. Things start to get rather complex though...Based on a Robert A Heinlein story, the plot is very clever. Too clever. Sometimes it is as if the twists are all for cleverness sake. Everything fits together in the end, so the twists are relevant. I guess it is also the fact that the end is a bit anticlimactic too (though, once again, appropriate) that makes you feel you've watched a great cerebral exercise...with no consequence.Also, the great revelation near the end can be spotted a long way from the end.Good performance by Ethan Hawke in the lead role and Noah Taylor in a supporting role. The standout performance, however, is by Sarah Snook in two roles. Also, kudos to whoever did her makeup, especially for the male role.Ultimately, Predestination is every intriguing and, for once, a movie that makes you think.

His story about being her, the tale of an unfulfilled life marked by abandonment, is remarkable, but that's nothing compared to what the The Bartender has in the building's basement......Be patient with this film, very patient, see it a few times, and then you'll will reap the benefits of one of the most original Science Fiction movies made in such a long time.You cannot help but get dragged under deep magnetic grasp of the intricate narrative, and although there will be many, many different interpretations of the plot, and narrative, you cannot deny that the film is one trippy experience.Once you get over the fact that Snook looks like DiCaprio in make mode, its makes it a viewing experience I guarantee you haven't had in a very long time, and the majority of the film is set in a bar. The first act alone is Ethan Hawke listening to a story, but it's so gripping, you forget this.When the second act begins, the film goes bonkers mad, or very straight down the narrative line, depending what side you are watching it from. If you are watching it from Hawkes POV, you will realise he's just trying to straighten things out for the greater good, but if you look at it from Snooks POV, you set heading into Altered States territory.It's your average story of an experimental girl, who meets a man, gets pregnant, discovers she has make organs, turns into a man, goes back in time, meets his younger female self, gets her pregnant, and she gives birth to her/himself, and the probably turns into Ethan Hawke.Talk about loving yourself.But joking aside, its a brilliant movie, with a potentially difficult narrative explained clearly and excellently.Brilliant stuff.",Predestination
17,siderite,Time travel all over again,8,20 December 2014,"It is difficult to do a good time travel movie, it really is. All of the successful movies in the genre, and I mean ALL of them, are carried by their main actors and Predestination is no exception. The reason is that any time travel plot usually invalidates itself. If you think about it, what happens in Predestination doesn't make much sense either.So, what do we have? Any discussion about the plot itself is pointless. You have to watch a confusing series of time jumps and confessions (that's an internal joke, you'll get it... in time muhahahaha) just to get to the end Big Reveal. The acting of Ethan Hawke isn't worth mentioning, since it is good, but not that difficult. Instead who shines through is Sarah Snook, who carried the entire exposition of the film on her back singlehandedly.I didn't read the Heinlein short story (All you zombies), but from its synopsis it's pretty much the same plot, only in a short story written in a day. I liked the setup, the direction, especially the acting, but what I didn't like as much is that even if the story had its own strange internal consistency, the main character didn't feel consistent to me. Also the terrorism angle I don't think was in the original story and I don't feel like it needed to be in the film.Bottom line: an above the average film with an intriguing plot. The acting was great, the feeling at the end is that it was a little bit too long and it tried to much to be too smart.",Predestination

20,lasttimeisaw,an audacious adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein's short story where solipsism and inevitability has been emblazoned to the fore,7,22 June 2017,"Aussie directors-duo the Spierig Brothers' third feature is an audacious adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein's short story ALL YOU ZOMBIES, where solipsism and inevitability has been emblazoned to the fore with a little help of the time travel gimmick, but the original text is obviously inadequate to qualify as a feature-length material, the brothers must beef up their script thence they introduce the character of the mysterious ""Fizzle Bomber"", a consequential decision both burnishes and undermines the film's appeal. Envelope has been furthermore pushed in a way that now Heinlein's solipsistic concept finally reaches its ultimate crest where a person (please suspending your disbelief!) can literally be conceived and terminated all by himself/herself, everything is able to be pre-designed as long as the said person is set to meet different versions of himself/herself in the right time, which makes the contrivances of hermaphrodite and facial disfigurement utilitarian methods to obfuscate audience's apprehension, and it does work if one does have entrenched faith in the soi-disant ""predestination paradox"", to quote Wikipedia, here is its definition ""a time loop in which a time traveler who has gone into the past causes an event that ultimately causes the original future version of the person to go back into the past"".On the other hand, the Fizzle Bomber appendage inevitably takes the shine off the otherwise unified theory by press-ganging a stiff character transformation which isn't as persuasive as the rest theory (however cockamamie it is!), Jane, John, the time-traveling agent, are the same person in different phases, we can buy that (which is Heinlein's whimsical idea), but why he also must be the Fizzle Bomber? If inevitability is the overriding proviso, the audience probably might feel discombobulated to suss what damage has the bomber done? Has the hyped terrorist crime in 1975 been pre-empted or is it as inevitable as the narcissistic chance meeting of falling in love with oneself in a previous time-line (albeit foreknowing all the consequences)? That is what bugging me the most upon a first viewing. Whereas a fascinating story is at its core, the film itself is less flashy and without much flourish, lackluster flashback and barroom tête-à-tête fill up most of the time, the meager action scenes are slipshod and the sole explosion set piece is atrociously cheap-looking. In the acting realm, Ethan Hawke is habitually on automatic pilot, giving the ex-positional guidance in earnest and maintains a necessary patina of engagement, but the linchpin here is the lesser-known Australian actress Sarah Snook, takes the dualistic role in her stride and proves to be pleasantly chameleon-like in juggling both sexes, adding much ballast to an utter tall-tale, totally beyond one's wildest imagination.",Predestination
21,KineticSeoul,"It through me off at first, but wow!",8,12 February 2015,"So from the trailer I thought this was gonna be some cool and yet forgettable sci-fi flick with some twist and turns. Yeah, it does have twist and turns but it's a low budget sci-fi film that actually stays with you. I first thought this was going to be a time travel movie with few action set pieces. And to my surprise there just wasn't much action. Instead it when in a direction I just really didn't expect, which revolves around a conversation between two characters at a bar. At first I felt disinterested, but as the story progressed and started to reveal itself little by little it actually got me immersed into what was going on. This is one of those movies where your watching it and think it's average or slightly above average. But after it's finished and you think about it, you just can't help but be awestruck by it. When it comes to the revelation I was like ""whoa and what the heck"" and yet be struck by how clever it is. Ethan Hawke is good, he is just good at playing these range of characters. But what amazed me the most is the acting chops from Sarah Snook, her range is just superb and it takes a bit of guts to play the role that she played in this one. Overall, predestination is a movie that doesn't revolve around time travel but it's a device that there to carry on a cleverly constructed scenarios and story.8.2/10",Predestination
22,cherold,talky and tedious adaptation of Heinlein's classic short story,4,24 September 2020,"All You Zombies is a short story by Robert Heinlein that cleverly outlines a paradox inherent in the concept of time travel.Predestination takes the story, adds a terrorism story and one more iteration to the whole thing, and then proceeds to unspool a movie in which a huge chunk is one character telling his life story to another character.The filmmakers spend 100 minutes telling a 20-minute story, and telling it as dully as possible. And the little bit they added in an attempt to make it something more than the intellectual exercise of the original makes it less smart and less ingenious than the story.On the plus side, the Dickensianly-named Sarah Snook is excellent as the teller of the life story. It's a touching, nuanced performance that can't overcome the bland dialogue and sluggish pace she is stuck with.Don't bother watching this movie (I'm so perplexed that it's doing so well on IMDB reviews, but go figure). Do bother reading the short story.",Predestination

I guessed almost everything that was supposed to be a surprise. the final twist did nothing for me because I was already assuming that since he said ""then you understand who I am"" after already wondering about it earlier. There was not a single ""omg moment"" for me. and I know there are certain things you just have to accept when it comes to a time travel paradox, but they just took it to a new level. It just really makes no sense for the same person to be the mother father and daughter. usually time travel stories are a loop that connects the past and the future, this is just a closed loop that connects with itself and nothing else",Predestination
24,Robert_duder,Described as this years Looper is not far off...brilliant sci-fi film,10,19 January 2015,"The first I heard from this film was an interview with Ethan Hawke. I wish I hadn't heard that interview. Please whatever you do if you intend on seeing this film...stop reading about it right now. Even if that means you don't read my review (although I intend on NOT giving anything away) but Pre-Destination is brilliant. It might be one of the best Sci-Fi scripts ever written. It is stunningly intelligent and mind bending and right up there with Inception and Looper...two of my favourite films in this genre. It is the type of film that cannot be watched once because you'd never get it and yet you will enjoy it every time you watch it because you'll find something different in it every time you watch it. It is a thriller, it is a mystery, fill of crime and clues and twists and turns and while you're scratching you're head at certain things you'll know that there is definitive answer to everything. Best of all the two lead performances of the film are absolutely brilliant. Certainly anyone who doesn't enjoy the genre will find this too much for them and you have to have your brain on and constantly working. It is a brilliant thriller and just might be one of the best films I've seen in 2014.Ethan Hawke is dark and mysterious and brooding as ""the barkeep."" It actually is probably the best performance I can think of seeing him in. He is passionate in this role and mesmerizing and its no easy feat given his co-star. In my world of awards I would think Hawke and his co-star deserve far more recognition than what they get. The closing scene of this film with Hawke is just mind blowing. His co-star is Sarah Snook and this better be a breakout role for her because simply put...WOW! This is an Oscar worthy performance that isn't likely to ever get that kind of recognition. Snook is incredible playing duel roles that at first glance you don't think she'll pull off but as the film unfolds you become completely entranced with her and her performance. This is easily one of the best roles I've seen all year and bravo to her for pulling it off. Her and Hawke are amazing together. And for this cast (although there are a few very minor supporting performances) that's all that's necessary. These two actors make this story come alive and in your face in a way that I rarely see.The Spierig Brothers who directed this have gained something of a cult following but they really only have a few films to their credit. I thought Daybreakers was average but showed a lot of potential and while I've heard interesting things about their other film ""Undead"", I have yet to see it. But none of that matters because they've proved themselves without any doubt with this film which they also wrote. Their direction, the gritty setting, the way they handle time travel and the various time periods that are briefly visited and most of all the sheer intelligence behind this masterful script proves that these two have so much going for them that they've instantly made me a life long fan. I love a script that is undeniably brilliant and complex BUT it does make sense. You may have to watch it more than once and you may have to really think about it but its not confusing or complex just for the sake of being so. This made perfect sense the first viewing and it made me sit there as the credits rolled and say ""Wow."" That is the mark of an amazing film. If I can actually feel literally blown away then you've made something amazing. Predestination is easily thee best sci-fi film of the year and easily one of the best movies of 2014.

25,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Fantastic science-fiction that stands up to scrutiny.,8,16 May 2018,"'Predestination (2014)' is a fantastic time-travel film that stands up to scrutiny even on multiple watches. It is an unpredictable story that's riveting from start to finish. The narrative starts off slowly, seemingly insignificant for much of the run-time, but then a sudden change in pace and some major plot reveals shift all that came before and make each frame wholly necessary. It really is a surprisingly, and satisfyingly, complex yet cohesive story. The circles it makes make perfect sense. The flick has a much lower budget than most features, yet stands tall due to its fantastic script which proves it really is all in the writing. This should be seen by every fan of science-fiction or time-travel. 8/10",Predestination
26,bowmanblue,Better than I expected,7,26 April 2015,"I had never heard of 'Predestination.' I don't know for sure, but I'm guessing it never received a theatrical release in cinemas. Or, if it did, it was a 'limited run' and I didn't notice. Therefore, baring this in mind and the fact that it didn't have any 'big name' actors in it (apologises, Ethan Hawke), I kind of looked upon it as a B-movie that was released straight to DVD.But, regardless of its origins, it's actually pretty good. I have to confess that I wasn't really watching it properly to begin with. I kind of had it on in the background while I did other things. I read the blurb regarding its plot and saw something about 'time travelling agents' and preventing future crimes and considered it a basic 'bang bang' action movie.It isn't. There's actually very little action and you really do have to pay attention to get something out of it. It was because of that I started watching it again so I could actually know what's going on. Obviously, with anything regarding time travel, there are always going to be people who pick holes in the story, so you'll have to suspend your disbelief when it comes to the 'temporal physics' of it all.Ethan Hawke plays the time travelling agent who prevents crimes before they happen. However, even with all the technology at his disposal, he's still having trouble catching the 'fizzle bomber' before he strikes. At first it seemed that the story was going to be all about him, yet we meet a secondary character who sort of takes over the 'meat' of the tale.The tale itself is a twisted one. Anything concerning time travel is going to have to deal with paradoxes and parallel universes and realities. And 'Predestination' seems to involve all of them. And, if you can follow it (or should I say prepared to follow it) you'll definitely enjoy it. It's not an action movie and it's certainly not fast-paced. It's more of a thriller/sci-fi drama that you will have to follow closely to make sure you don't miss something. You're only going to get to watch it the once before you know all the twists and turns of the tale, so watch it closely and enjoy the mystery surrounding the plot.",Predestination
27,ThomasDrufke,An Instant Buy,10,9 July 2018,"Predestination is one of those science fiction films that perfectly exemplifies everything that confuses and fascinates me about time travel. It's both brilliantly cerebral and mind bogglingly complex. But the movie tightly tells the complex story in 90 minutes, without sacrificing any nuance. It's one of the few movies that I can say I instantly knew I was going to buy the blu-ray right after the credits rolled. Among the many impressive aspects to the story, is the story-telling structure. It feels equally part Nolan and Kubrickian, with a bit of a David Lynch/David Fincher vibe mixed in. However most importantly, Predestination feels like an original film bolstered by performances from the always great Ethan Hawke, as well as the career making turn from Sarah Snook. The depths both of them take their roles, but particularly Snook, is fascinating. And surprisingly neither of them were considered for Oscar noms in 2015. In short, Predestination is one of the best sci-fi's of the last decade.10/10",Predestination
28,cricketbat,A mind-bending twist of the time-travel genre,5,28 December 2018,"Predestination is a mind-bender. This movie offers an interesting twist on the time-travel genre. However, it takes so long to get where it's going that it becomes predictable. Sarah Snook and Ethan Hawke are good, but their performances are bogged down by the story and the pacing.

29,A_Different_Drummer,Snook is Amazing!,9,1 December 2014,"The one of a kind thriller is destined to make a mark. It is not only entertaining in its own right but pretty sets the bar for the ultimate trans-gender film, the ultimate time travel paradox story, and the ultimate riff on a popular insult which suggests that the target of the insult perform an un-natural act...Sarah Snook is astonishing. I need to use a thesaurus to find a better word. When you consider that they given Oscar nominations to films like TOOTSIE, you have to wonder what this performance is worth? Because her performance here is in a class by itself, so engaging, so empathetic, that the viewer would like to have lunch with both characters at the same time, if such a thing were possible.The Spierig Brothers deserve additional praise not only for handling this so well but you have to realize how much backstory and exposition they crammed into the first 30 minutes.

First of all, i was hoping for some good time travel thriller, as these are rare lately, ""Predestination"" looked like it can be very good flick. After watching it, i can say that5 it left me somehow disappointed in overall delivery.The craftsmanship of this movie is very good. Acting is especially solid by Sarah Snook, and as usual OK by Ethan Hawke. Directing, pacing of this movie are solid as well, as for running time 90 min i was engaging in a story. But after movie was over, i was disappointed in final experience. I love movies that surprises you. But this one left me more confused then surprised. The story is kinda original i you ask me, but i didn't get it by the end - well, i did get it, but it wasn't the most realistic time travel movie if you ask me, and this one, based on paradoxes is interesting, but overall i think it's just nonsense - that's just mine opinion.Overall, ""Predestination"" is very well crafted and intriguing experience, but one that will leave you confused rather then satisfying.",Predestination
32,tabuno,A Really Good Cerebral Time Travel Adventure Requiring More Than One Visit,9,8 January 2019,"21 November 2017. Ethan Hawke stars as a time traveler to prevent major crime from happening. He and a woman are separately introduced to a Space Corp for women which requires some blind acceptance on the part of the audience until a reasonable explanation occurs about a third of the way into the movie. Like Point of No Return (1993) with Bridget Fonda, there is a lot of character development during the first part of the movie, though not quite as exciting and thrilling as Fonda's experience compared Sarah Snook's character in this movie. Her experience continued to be shrouded in much more mystery. Her flashback, recollection of her past, was presented fairly decently and the mystery to her story was sufficient to retain an interest in the story even without the action of Fonda's character's somewhat more intense rebellious attitude. However, what makes this particular movie stand out is its relevance to the contemporary social mores of the times and how the twist in this movie provides some insight into the current tension being felt in today's society, though to say too much more would be to reveal too much to the audience. Additionally, the script is character-driven, so much more than most sci fi action,/// adventures, including mysterious relationships and innocent pure love.This is also a science fiction movie about adoption and even kidnapping and yet the story flows well, incorporating these themes and enhances the audience's appeal to and concern for the characters in the movie. At the same time, the level attraction towards Snook's character is of some revealing importance and, for the most, is sustained of which she deserves some credit due to her appealing as well as revealing performance and it almost takes up half the movie at that. The reveal of this movie is striking and in some ways quite poignant. The next scene, reveals some pretty poor shooting skills, a rather distracting and irritating revelation, perhaps unfortunately necessary for how the script was written and almost borders on laziness and lack of creativity yet is also includes a double reveal that quite compelling in itself. The use of the time paradoxes are quite strong in this movie and the director doesn't shy away from it. Yet by the end of the movie, it seems that the whole movie comes full circle, unless one is smart, so that at least two viewing are recommended or just go to Wikipedia instead for answers.",Predestination
33,The-Sarkologist,One Awesome Time Travel Film,9,31 March 2021,"I had almost given up on Netflix films, and Australian Sci-fi films until I stumbled across this one. Actually, it is based upon a novel by Robert Heinlein called 'All You Zombies', and even though I haven't read that story the thing that stood out was that it seemed to be pretty close to the events in the novel. I say that because the organisations, and the dates that were mentioned, were clearly the style that I would have come to have expected from Heinlein. Mind you, there are a few things in this film that quite surprised me, considering that Heinlein was pretty conservative, but it was still pretty impressive.Mind you, I really don't want to say anything about this film because even the tiniest hint could give too much away. However, what I can say is that it is about time travel, and they really take the concept to the utmost extremes. Okay, normally I would give more away than that, but it really depends on how good the film is, and honestly, this film was really, really good.Another thing that stood out, other than a story that has an awful lot of twists, and some great acting,was also the way the film was put together. It was pretty slick, especially since I suspect that it was rather low budget. Yeah, this film was really, really good, and really well put together, and I certainly recommend watching it, especially if you like sci-fi, time travel, and lots and lots of twists.",Predestination
34,eddie_baggins,A real Aussie beauty with a fantastic performance by Sarah Snook,8,4 February 2015,"If someone were to tell you that originality in movies is dead, you need to look no further but to point them in the general direction of this Australian effort by the Spierig Brothers, a stunningly constructed and emotionally deep Sci-Fi that will be running around in your head for days after the original viewing. Predestination really is a unique piece of work and one of the most fully developed Australian films in recent memories that features a star making turn from young actress Sarah Snook.Based upon Robert A. Heinlein's short story All You Zombies, viewing Predestination is best done as blind as possible as the movies convoluted yet well told tale is one that people will be picking apart for years to come, usually the best sign that a Sci-Fi movie has hit the mark. Australian duo The Spierig's deserve full credit for their handling of this story and it's great to see the directors act upon the promise shown in their original horror debut from 2003 Undead and the hit and miss Daybreakers from 2009. Predestination has a quality feel to it, a strong directional sense and it would've been an easy task for a director or in this case directors to get lost in material that consistently flaunts the line of credibility but as a whole the movie absolutely succeeds at expressing a cohesive and an at times emotionally profound tale that features one of 2014's most outstanding acting turns.While Ethan Hawke is a well proved and solid performer, Predestination's star is without question Sarah Snook. An actress perhaps previously best known publicly by her turns in TV show Packed to the Rafters and films such as These Final Hours and Sleeping Beauty, Snook in a role that is anything but one note, powerfully acts out some of the most difficult and emotionally taxing scenes your likely to see in such a genre and her turn is often jaw on the floor good. It's a joy watching Snook ply her trade in a role that allows her a full arsenal of different emotional arcs and sensibilities and for those in Hollywood that catch this little seen yet well regarded gem, you get the feeling they will be on the phone to Snook's agent in hope of securing her services. Predestination is absolutely Snook's film and without her services it could've quite easily been less impactful than its final product.A hard film to talk about without spoiling much of its narrative gold, Predestination is a thoroughly enjoyable and original piece of Sci-Fi movie making and a quality example of what Australian films can be. It would be wrong to say Predestination is a film with twists, but its plot developments are undeniably intense and often shocking and this really is a fine calling card for The Spierig Brothers and a smack-down acting turn from Snook that should see her quickly become Australia's next big thing.

35,leonblackwood,Confusing! 4/10,4,12 April 2015,"Review: This is one of those movies that I have to watch again because I haven't got a clue what was going on. Its based around a time machine and a agent who prevents crimes before they happen. That bit I understood but I didn't get the whole bomber aspect. Was it him? Was he the girl? I haven't got a clue and when the whole thing pieced together at the end, I was still confused. You do end up sticking with the movie because you want to see how it pans out but in my case, I really didn't get it. I liked the whole story of the woman who changed her gender but that storyline also got confusing after a while. Its a cleverly written storyline which has some good performances but I hate when directors have to over complicate films, like Christopher Nolan with Inception, which I still don't understand. Anyway, if your super intelligent and you like your time machine type of movies then this is right up your alley but I personally got fed up with the whole back and forth into different dimensions, concept. Confusing!Round-Up: Ethan Hawke is another one of those actors who had a promising career but then his movies started to go straight to DVD. He was great in Training Day and he has got a lot of praise for his role in Boyhood but his consistency is questionable. I personally think that he hasn't got enough tools in the box to become an all time great actor, but he has made some decent choices in his career which has kept him in the spotlight. I liked Sarah Snook, who played the woman/man role quite well but I haven't seen her in anything else so I can't compare her performance with anything else. This is definitely one of those movies that will strike a debate because of the different ways that you can take the storyline. It does start off quite good and it was quite easy to follow but once the violin box came out, which was the time machine, it went all over the place and I just couldn't keep up with who was who and what was what.Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $3.4millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their sci-fi thrillers about an agent who has to use a time machine to catch a bomber. 4/10",Predestination
36,howard.schumann,Challenges us at every moment,9,26 July 2016,"Whether or not space-time is an actual reality or simply an illusion, a convenient concept of the mind to get us through the day, is not relevant here. The Spierig Brothers (""Daybreakers"") mesmerizing film Predestination postulates that it is real, but that is only the starting point of a film that challenges us at every moment to make sense of a plot that becomes more and more complex as it unfolds. Based on Robert A. Heinlein's 1958 story, ""All You Zombies,"" the film flashes backwards and forwards in time between 1945 to 1992, opening in 1970 as Temporal Agent (Ethan Hawke, ""Maggie's Plan""), attempting to defuse a bomb left by a serial killer known as the ""fizzle "" bomber, is badly burned and must undergo complete facial reconstruction.The man, a time-traveling government agent who is dedicated to preventing crimes from happening before they occur, has repeatedly been unable to stop the bomber set to destroy a few blocks of New York City a few years later. The story then moves to where the now facially rebuilt agent in working as a bartender. When he serves a drink to an androgynous looking man, the strange customer bets that he can tell him the most bizarre story that he ever heard. It may not be the most bizarre story the ""barkeep"" ever heard, but it is definitely one of the strangest I have. The story teller, known only as ""The Unmarried Mother,"" a writer of true confessions articles, tells how he grew up as a female after having been dropped on the doorstep of an orphanage by an anonymous stranger.From the beginning, the girl named Jane feels different. Physically strong and aggressive, she tries to become a member of Space Corps, a group catering to the pleasures of lonely astronauts run by the enigmatic Mr. Robertson (Noah Taylor, ""Lost in Karastan""). A brief love affair and pregnancy with a man who suddenly deserts her puts an end to her dreams. After giving birth, she is told by her doctors that she has been born with both male and female internal organs and will have to live her life henceforth as a man. Changing her name to John, he/she is now offered the chance by the barkeep to go back in time and kill the man who ruined her life without facing any consequences.Unlike many films of the genre, Predestination pauses long enough between plot twists to tell a very human story that is emotionally engaging. Most of the reason for this is the empathetic performance of Australian actress Sarah Snook (""Steve Jobs"") who has the sadness of ages written on her face. It would not do justice to the film to try and explain it (even assuming that I could) since half the fun of the experience is to figure it out, or, in any case, give it your best shot. Suffice it to say, if you are thinking about building a time machine and going back in time to correct some egregious mistake you made, the message of the film is that it might be better to leave well enough alone.",Predestination
37,TheMovieDiorama,Predestination foreordained its paradoxical nature and exploited it with individuality.,7,21 October 2019,"""Which came first: the chicken or the egg?"". An evolutionary question, now the setup for many punchlines, that has transcended time itself. The causality dilemma that considers both cause and effect. Infinite regression. Unsolvable. What really shapes a person's biological anatomy or their metaphorical soul? Evolutionary diversity at birth or the nurturing of our surrounding environment? The aforementioned philosophical paradox is one which The Spierig Brothers held closely to the central plot that, on the surface may befuddle even the most avid sci-fi viewers, but dig somewhat deeper and find that the temporal trajectory is bursting with thematic representation. A time traveller is sent back to 1970s New York to prevent a terrorist, known only as the ""Fizzle Bomber"", from murdering thousands.To mention certain plot strands, even touching upon their delicate coating, would be to spoil this ingeniously creative film. Therefore, as a precaution, I will not discuss the second half. Including the paradoxical plot twists of conception and death. This is a mind-bending sci-fi tale that purely excels when focussing on the human elements of its characters. Forget about the jarring tonal shift from exquisitely detailed flashback narration to sudden sci-fi extravaganza. Put aside the occasional heavy hand-holding (although justified for the dense concept) that unimaginatively explains the limitations of temporal shifting. Exclude the multitude of entrancing twists that seemingly allow the narrative to crumble towards its inevitable conclusion.Predestination works best when it's exploring the human condition. The drive that constitutes our soul. And a central focal point, but not the sole purpose, of the story is Jane's gender reassignment into becoming John. A ""woman"" valued as intersex. Internalised male organs as well as female. Despite raising transgender issues and justifiably exploring the emotional conflict of such a scenario, it's never treated as unfamiliar territory. Much like the film in its entirety, it garners an identity. Enhancing accessibility by turning an irrelevant piece of fiction into a relevant transcendental concept. Snook gave an arousing performance of someone undergoing such a procedure. Harnessing female and male acting qualities and nudging them subtly through her performance.Returning to the preliminary question though, the eternally talented Hawke offers this dilemma to the prognosticating Snook, who simply replies ""The Rooster"". And yet whilst it was a humorous retort, it maps out the ingenious narrative cohesion that The Spierig Brothers moulded. That intimidating evolutionary deliverance, providing a cathartic allure of inevitability. They masqueraded causality through a simple life story told vividly within the confinements of a cigarette infused bar. Strangely, much like with other labyrinthine features, the second viewing allowed me to sniff out breadcrumbs more clearly. The hidden clues that the Brothers had deliberately positioned to reach the predetermined final destination. Extraordinarily clever.The minuscule runtime should've been extended to better build the narrative foundations from the weight of all the mind-blowing twists, but The Spierig Brothers defied genre expectations by pushing a time-orientated story to its limits. The conventional boundaries of storytelling now extended indefinitely, addressing common time travel related issues and exploiting them ingeniously. Intelligence prevails once again.",Predestination

39,jtindahouse,A patient wait worth every second,9,4 January 2015,"Time travel movies are always a lot of the fun (with the exception of 2003's 'Timeline' of course). I've always found they're a lot more enjoyable if you simply turn your brain off, to an extent, and except the way the filmmaker chooses to portray this intricate subject. The rules are always a little bit different from film to film but who's to say what's right and what's not considering time travel doesn't actually exist. 'Predestination' is a very tricky little story that's a lot of fun to watch unravel. For almost the entire first half of the film we are treated to a story being told by Sarah Snook's character 'The Unmarried Woman' to Ethan Hawke's character 'The Bartender'. I wondered briefly if I had put in the right film, but I recalled that yes the opening title 'Predestination' had appeared, so I stuck with it and continued to be patient. It did help that the story and scene were masterly acted especially on Snook's part. She's a wonderful actress who has a big future in the industry.The story, it turned out, was a very nice set up and launched a brilliant second half of the film which culminated in a perfectly executed twist reveal that will leave jaws gaping. It never cheats, in fact it's so well crafted you could kick yourself for not picking exactly how it would end. But that's what's so good about it is that you don't. I haven't seen any of the Spierig Brothers other films (this is only their third feature length) but if 'Predestination' is an indication of their quality then I may have to check the other two out - and sadly by the looks of it wait about 6 years for their next film.",Predestination
40,Turfseer,"Unusual, original time travel tale combines sci-fi and noir elements but features a twist ending more speciously clever than meaningful",6,25 October 2018,"An unusual Australian import, Predestination features an odd combination of sci fi and film noir elements. The film stars Ethan Hawke as a time travelling ""temporal agent"" who belongs to a shadowy government agency in 1985 attempting to prevent the evil ""Fizzle Bomber"" from setting off a bomb in New York City in 1975 which results in the murder of over 10,000 people. The film is based on a 1959 short story by Robert Heinlein entitled ""-All You Zombies-.""
The story starts off with a bang as the temporal agent is severely injured when one of the Fizzle Bomber's bombs explodes in his face requiring facial reconstruction surgery. In his new identity, the agent goes back to NYC in 1970 where he works as a barkeep (the character is identified with that name in the credits). There he meets a bar patron identified as ""The Unmarried Woman,"" a True Confessions writer played by Australian actress Sarah Snook.
Snook steals the show as a woman who undergoes a sex change operation and is now a man, recounting a sad but absorbing tale of how she arrived at her present circumstances. Her story begins as an infant left on the doorsteps of a Cleveland orphanage in 1945 by a mysterious man. She grows up as ""Jane,"" a shy but brilliant young woman who applies for an early 60s space program entitled Space Corps.
The women there are groomed as glorified ""Comfort women,"" The plot twists grow exponentially as Jane is forced to leave the program after getting pregnant by another mysterious man with whom she falls in love but who suddenly disappears. While delivering her baby, the doctors discover she has vestigial male sex organs and they're forced to operate, changing her into a man. If that's not surprising enough, soon her baby is kidnapped from the hospital which leaves Jane (now ""John"") shattered and bereft.
At this point the story is fully engaging but soon the focus shifts to Hawke's character. He offers the newly minted John a chance to take revenge on the man who got her pregnant and then disappeared if John agrees to take over the agent's job. When John jumps back into time, he meets his earlier self as Jane and falls in love with her. John impresses Jane by constantly ""guessing"" what she's thinking. John realizes now that he's the mysterious stranger who got Jane pregnant and then suddenly left her.
Even more bizarre is the big reveal that it's the temporal agent who steals Jane's baby from the hospital and brings her back to orphanage. SUPER SPOILERS AHEAD. That creates the paradox that Jane, John and their baby, are the same person!
If that's not enough, the Temporal Agent returns to 1975 to help the agent who's injured by the Fizzle Bomber's bomb. That agent is actually John so we now realize that John is the same person as the temporal agent but due to the paradox of time travel, they both fell in love with Jane, their former self.
Hawke as the Temporal Agent after facial reconstruction, gets to finally save the day by going back in time and killing his future self, the Fizzle Bomber. Instead of the big explosion killing thousands in NYC in 1975, Hawke's Temporal Agent ends up saving thousands of lives along (I guess) a newly created timeline.
You might actually have to watch the film a second time to understand everything that's happening (or even read the Wikipedia plot summary!). I get the whole idea that Hawke's character is competing with Snook's for the love of their former self. But why go through this whole thing of kidnapping the baby and ensuring that all the principals are the same person?
The plot summary in Wikipedia explains it-but I'm still uncertain whether this is a satisfying explanation. Actually it's Robertson, the head of the temporal agency that has engineered the creation of ""an agent who has no ties to time. This ""perfect"" temporal agent was responsible for both his own conception and death."" Without all these machinations, the temporal agent will end up as the Fizzle Bomber, who has become deranged due to time travel. There would be no one left to finish him off had Hawke's ""perfect"" temporal agent not been perfected through all the selective inbreeding.
In the end, Predestination is designed simply to shock by the introduction of a clever but specious twist ending. Contrast that with another time traveling tale such as ""Back to the Future,"" where the underlying premise has an overarching theme: the restoration of masculinity formerly denied. No such theme emerges here. Still, the bulk of the film, which chronicles the fascinating tale of an intersex character, sets this time travel tale as a decent enough entry in the pantheon of such a genre, due to the unusual history and pedigree of such an androgynous character.",Predestination
41,drqshadow-reviews,"Flawed But Daring, Its Last Ten Minutes are an Incredible Rush",8,25 March 2015,"Under-the-radar, concept-driven science fiction with a heavy dose of suspense. Ethan Hawke plays a decade-leaping ""temporal agent,"" dedicated to stopping the spree of a mysterious mass bomber who wipes out several blocks of New York City in the late 20th century. Along the way, he randomly stops by a bar in 1978 where he settles in to share stories with a down-on-his-luck patron and the plot seems to derail. It's strange, confusing pacing that sets aside the core concept in lieu of a very long, seemingly-unrelated aside, but naturally there's more here than meets the eye. That digression is an intriguing one, albeit in a completely different vein than the advertised premise, and tucks neatly into the endgame during the film's chaotic, full-throttle closing act. Fans of Total Recall and Inception will find themselves mesmerized by the percussive power of its late plot twists, even if they are made a hair less ambiguous than I think was really necessary. These are some pretty big swings, and they'll probably turn off a good portion of the audience, but I enjoy that kind of risk-taking and it feels like they transform what had been a mediocre also-ran into something much closer to the remarkable.",Predestination
42,XweAponX,"I know where I come from, but where do All you Zombies...",10,17 December 2014,"If Robert A Heinlein and his wife Virginia had lived to see this, they would have been more than pleased. They would have sat there with jaw agape at how perfectly this film follows every detail of the story it is based upon.I heard about this project a few months ago in a Reddit board. Whenever I hear about my favorite books or stories being made into Film, I always wonder how much they will muck it up. In the case of this, the source matériel is so unusual that I knew that regardless of who made this film, I would be seeing ""All you Zombies"".Of course, anyone who has read ""All You Zombies"" - The Short (very short) story by The Dean of Science Fiction, would have every detail of it memorized. It's one of those stories you have to read, and then read again, and then wonder what the blazes you have read, so you read it again. This is one of those stories that you have to read maybe 50 timers before you really understand what's being said.Because there is no ""Unwed Mother"", there is no ""Bartender"" and there is no ""Fizzle Bomber"", at least not as individual people. And there never was a baby dropped off at the steps of an orphanage in 1945. And John Never met Jane. And most important, the Chicken never laid the egg that grew back up into the Chicken.Of course, that ""Chicken"" would have also have to have been 1/2 Rooster. But that is Heinlien's Handywork for you, his twisted humor, which he revisits in his last four books from ""The Number of the Beast"" to ""To Sail Beyond the Sunset""- All of which deal with Time Travel and Alternate Universes. This is a story that takes time and tosses it into a blender and re- shapes it, but where other Time Travel paradox stories fail is where 'All you Zombies"" is a perfect circle, we can see the clear direction of Time's Arrow.Speaking of which, the story which comes closest to Predestination's planned perfection is Star Trek's ""Times Arrow"" two parter which spans from 1890's San Francisco to the planet Dividia II in the 24th Century- Beginning and ending with Data's Head. But where some of these Time Tales revolve around an ""Altered Timeline"", this one has none of that- It's all the same Timeline, the time-line of a single individual.But this story can never go past the 50 year mark - 50 years from when time travel had been ""stitched"" out, in either direction. Because just like Heinlein's very first published story ""LifeLine"", this is all told from within the life span of one person.In a way, John and Jane's story is the story of every man or woman on Earth, but In John's case, he actually was ""his own grandpa"".I have read All You Zombies at least a hundred times, I know every facet of this story. And whoever ""The Spierig Brothers"" are, they not only created this perfect rendition of the story, even doing much of the special effects and music - But on top of that, they UNDERSTOOD exactly what Heinlein was saying, and so there is not one idle phrase from the story that is not represented here, in this visual retelling.I have been waiting for this story to be made into a film all of my life, and I for one am in no way disappointed with any part of it - The story is recanted by Jane/John to ""The Bartender"" just like the written story, and the events of John's story match every detail of the original short story.There are some things that go a little further than the story, like this stuff about a ""Fizzle Bomber"", And I think it was a logical way to include the Ending of the story - Because the short story only has the Beginning and the Middle and then the beginning again, so the added material actually provides the end of the Ouruboros' tail- The snake that eats it's own tail.It's just another Brief History of Time, but in this case it tells a remarkable and fascinating story.",Predestination
43,estebangonzalez10,A great story weakened by the time traveling elements,6,19 December 2014,"""Let's face it. Nobody's innocent. Everybody just uses everybody else to get what they want.""Predestination reunites the twin directors, Michael and Peter Spierig, with Ethan Hawke after their contribution together in 2009's Daybreakers. This sci-fi time traveling film was based on Robert A. Heinlein's story ""All You Zombies"" and adapted by the Spierig brothers themselves. Time traveling films can be tricky because the paradox and rules can be confusing at times, and for me it didn't make sense logically speaking and therefor had a large amount of plot holes. Predestination is still entertaining at times, mostly when it stays away from the time traveling and the ""Fizzle Bomber"" subplot and centers on the narration by Sarah Snook's character of her personal history. That was the highlight of the film for me and I actually found her story quite engaging and inventive. The resolution on the other hand left me unsatisfied and when the time traveling begins to take center stage you know what direction it is heading. The twists aren't surprising as they try to be and you get to the resolution before the film actually does. Your appreciation for this film might depend on whether or not you buy the entire paradox of the movie. I didn't, so much of the resolution was unsatisfying and failed to resonate with me. I did enjoy the mid act of the film and will give the film credit for introducing an interesting narration that kept me engaged with the story. I just wished the film could've centered more on Snook's character instead of wondering off in the final act and returning to the ""Fizzle bomber"" subplot.Ethan Hawke gives a convincing performance as the Temporal Agent who is on his last mission trying to stop a bomber who has eluded him over the past. The sci-fi element of the film wasn't actually my favorite, but when the film settles down in a bar and focuses on a narration and dialogue between his character and Sarah Snook's the film excels. Sarah Snook takes the film away from Hawke and gives one of the strongest performances of the year. She was impressive and I wish the rest of the film would've focused on her interaction with him. Her character goes through a series of transformations and the story could've centered on it instead, focusing on how she dealt with her shifting identity. Instead the film introduces some of these issues only to get the plot moving and never really deals with her inner struggles. They were just pieces of a puzzle that were conveniently placed so the audience could fit them together in the end, when it actually could've been a one of a kind character study instead. Predestination has its high and lows, but it is worth the watch for Snook's performance and the memorable narration that takes place in the bar. It is a great story, which unfortunately suffers from an unsatisfying ending. Looper is much more effective when it comes to time traveling, but this has an intriguing story going for it.",Predestination
44,Fluke_Skywalker,Trippy time travel tale,7,19 June 2015,"Based on a novel by sci-fi great Robert Heinlein ('All You Zombies'), 'Predestination' is a briar patch of time paradox issues. When such issues aren't just a result of actions taken by characters, but the framework of the entire story, it can potentially sink the entire affair. Fortunately the brothers Spierig thoughtfully craft this intricate tale, and even during its wonkiest moments, 'Predestination' is held together by strong performances from the somehow still underrated Ethan Hawke and especially Sarah Snook. The latter is an actress to watch and was deserving of Oscar consideration here (likely snubbed due to the Academy's aversion to recognizing science fiction).",Predestination

46,jimbo-53-186511,"Will no doubt take countless viewings to fully understand it, but is it worth the effort?",5,25 February 2016,"It's evident at a very early stage that Predestination is a film that you'll really need to pay attention to whilst watching it. It's a dialogue heavy film and one that I feel perhaps spends too much time setting up its story and not enough time telling its story. Interestingly this creates a film of two halves where the first half is a little on the slow side and the second half actually seems rushed and a little messy - this perhaps explains why I found it confusing as it threw a lot at me in the final act. I also felt that it was needlessly complicated and at times I got confused with all the time-travelling - it literally 'jumped' backwards and forwards far too much with very little in the way of explanation as to what was going on at certain points within the film.Despite the rather uneven approach adopted here, Predestination never feels like a complete waste of time; it's themes of self-discovery and struggling with one's identity do make it relatively interesting and did give me something to think about whilst watching the film. The other strand to the plot regarding preventing crimes before they happen does enough to keep the story moving, but ultimately isn't quite as interesting or original as the main theme on offer here - we've seen this sort of thing done before in Minority Report.Hawke is pretty good here even though, at times, it sounded like he was doing an impression of Rorschach from Watchmen. Snook is the one that really deserves acknowledgement taking on a more complex role of dual characters and giving each character a unique identity.I've watched this film twice now and whilst I got more from it upon a second viewing (and managed to also understand it more on the second viewing) I still feel that it throws too much at the audience and tries to do too much (clearly a less is more approach has not been adopted here). I couldn't help but feel that it was trying too hard to be clever as well. It probably does require a few viewings to be able to get your head round it, but I'm not sure if that will prove to be a particularly constructive use of time.",Predestination

50,peterp-450-298716,A hard nut to crack but a brilliant storyline ...,7,20 December 2014,"""What if I could put him in front of you, the man that ruined your life. If I could guarantee that you'd get away with it. Would you kill him ?"" Sigh! Where are those good old days you could enjoy a movie about time traveling like ""Back to the future"",""The Terminator"",""Timecop"" or recently ""Looper"" while lying relaxed in your seat without craving for a glass of aspirin as the film progresses ? The principle of paradoxes known to time traveling is cited in these films (like Michael J. Fox becoming blurry and the threat of disappearing because of his parents growing apart), but isn't of primary importance for the entire motion picture. ""Predestination"" is something completely different and is put together pretty damn clever and shrewd. But I assure you, the numerous plot twists and interwoven time loops will make you completely dizzy. The film is a hard nut to crack and requires tremendous concentration. It's a film where you go from one surprise to the next. It's similar to the ""chicken and egg"" conundrum. At one moment you are very sure that the egg came first, but new developments and revelations make you doubt this fact again and you'll revise your conclusion.The film is based on the short story ""All you Zombies"" from A.Heinlein and tells the story of a ""Temporal Agent"" (Ethan Hawke) who, using an ingenious violin case, can travel back and forth again through time in order to prevent crimes . Especially that of the mysterious ""Fizzle Bomber"" who's responsible for a destructive bomb attack in the 70's in New York killing about 11,000 people. In a bar the agent, who is employed as a bartender, listens to the story of a certain John, who looks like a kind of Brian Molko from the 70's. What comes next are some bizarre drawn out story lines which, as the film slowly proceeds, merge into one point to ensure an obvious highlight. I'm not going further into details because this would only reveal the intricate puzzle. Unfortunately the final denouement only evokes a ""Ah that's how it is"" reaction. Eventually it's just a quirky fictional story with an identity crisis as central topic. However I think that the level of difficulty of this film will be a bit of an obstacle for most spectators.""Predestination"" is a masterpiece on a different level. The created atmosphere and especially the performances are eye candy. The 70's are beautifully portrayed. The zeitgeist of that time with its authentic locations, fashion and music. But mostly, the performances by Ethan Hawke and for me the so far completely unknown Australian Sarah Snook made this film worth viewing. Ethan Hawke once again played a convincing role after his less memorable performances in ""Getaway"" and ""The Purge"". Not an easy part, but again one that suits him. Sarah Snook, however, is the one who steals the show and plays a fairly special role. Personally I found the reasonable long scene with those two characters in the bar, where Snook told her life story, preternaturally gorgeous. A fascinating story with delightful pieces of conversations and highly entertaining. It also takes over half of the film to complete and is the foundation that bears the whole story. After this, things start to unravel.If there's a movie for which the concept ""Mind F*ck"" was invented, then it should be this one. A fascinating story. But it would be handy if they wrote a manual for it. Don't be daunted by the slow and stretched first part. It's there that the identity crisis of John is decomposed with surgical precision. The second part is dominated by the time travels and the resulting paradoxes. And then you'll understand the usefulness of the extended first part where all the pieces are manufactured, so they can be fitted into each other very subtle. Somewhere they gave it the name-tag a ""retro-futuristic thriller"" with also a bit of romance and humor. A film which is difficult to grasp, but definitely worthwhile. And now I have a reason to watch ""Jessabelle"". Sarah Snook, a name to keep your eye on.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",Predestination

This is slightly surprising considering it's very easy to get wrong and Predestination is a very good example of that.

By the time the last scene finished i sat there opened mouthed , not understanding very much of what i had just seen.

52,AudioFileZ,Surprised It Was As Good As It Was,7,29 October 2017,"I like good Sci-Fi flicks. I've not been much of a reader in the category however so, I was unfamiliar with Heinlein, I get he's one of the father's of the genre to many. This means often he's considered along side some of his contemporaries who became known better (i.e household names) than he, that would Asimov and Clarke. That said what I was able to read about Heinlein seemed promising so I thought it's Ethan Hawke and mostly he's enjoyable to watch and when he's not it usually doesn't take longer than 10 in and I'm done. So, Predestination got the nod for a look-see.Predestination has theme of time travel and a sub-text of how it could relate to keeping catastrophic events that happened from ever doing so. Perhaps it has a whole other question of what a person would do given the chance to alter outcomes? I guess time travel will always be of fantastical interest as in ""what if?"". But, terrorism and serial killing in a story from 1958that's impressive as now we are aware of a much different world. This would be shocking in the time it was written and sadly not so much when this film was made. Sometimes Sci-Fi incorporates things which seem far-fetched only to later become more relevant as if the writer saw the future. This quality is always impressive in retrospect. In as many ways the story has little relevance to the terrorism abatement as we know it (i.e. we can't travel back to alter time) but, it is somewhat amazing that in '58 that element was used, and in NYC as a key part of the story, which is definitely mind-bending. In the end it's pure entertainment and because it gets complicated with human emotions and smart slow reveals (as to who the travelers are) it holds your attention. The ending will be brilliant to some and frustrating to as many but, it's the ride in between that pulls the Sci-Fi fan in. In that regard it is quite an original and good flick.",Predestination
53,TheOneThatYouWanted,The worst kind of twist is the one you see coming.,6,16 May 2016,"So this movie has been on my watch list forever because someone told me it was worth watching. Somehow I avoided spoilers and went into it literally knowing nothing about it. And the first 5 or 10 minutes of film are pretty good. You get action and it gets you pumped up but goes nowhere because the movie is more or less just about the stupid twist you that you end up guessing within at least 30 minutes into the film. And that is the biggest problem with the film, it becomes so about the twist and tries to justify and hide the twist and it is annoying. The worst kind of twist is the one you see coming. If the film focused more on the event or ""person"" they're trying to stop and less on the lead character(s) of the film, it would have been better. It is the type of movie you start playing in the background while you're surfing the net or doing something else. Anyway, overall the film is boring as all Hell and the performances by Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook are wasted. Maybe they had to make it boring as all sh!t just to keep the budget down? Who knows who cares. The first 5 minutes and the last 5 minutes of the movie are the only reason I'm even giving it a 6 out of ten.",Predestination
54,Seraphion,"Witty and unique, another enjoyable time travel movie",7,28 November 2014,"An unnamed temporal agent goes back and forth through time preventing large scale crimes that would have claim many lives. In a 1975 New York boiler room, he finds a bomb. He disarms most of it, but the bomber beats him but the smaller bomb explodes. He reaches to his time machine. An unknown man helps him. He escapes to 1985 Temporal Bureau base and gets a facial reconstruction. Healed, he goes on his last mission to chase the Fizzle Bomber, who eluded them all this time. He lands in 1975 New York as a bartender. A man starts to chat with him. The man then tells his life's story. He was born in 1945 as an orphan girl who was named Jane. She grew smart and strong but with bad social life. In the 1960s, Jane was recruited by Mr. Robertson for an astronauts program, where she excels at every test. But her physique had a rare anomaly. She had both sets genitals, male and female. She was disqualified from the program, but they didn't tell her about the anomaly. She moves on with her life, meeting a stranger, falling in love for him until she bore his child. But the stranger left and never came back. Jane gave birth to a baby girl, but she was kidnapped. The labor's bleeding damages Jane's female genital so the doctors reconstructed her into a man using his existing male genital. Thus Jane transforms into John. Thus ends the man's story.The bartender reveals his true identity as a temporal agent and offers John a chance to kill the stranger that ruined Jane's life. John takes the chance and they go back to 1963 when Jane meets the stranger. But it turns out that John is the stranger whom Jane met. The agent continues on chasing the Fizzle Bomber. He goes back to the 1975 boiler room some time before his old self finds the bomb. He finds the bomber but again gets knocked out in a fight. He wakes up at an explosion and finds that he was the unknown person helping his burned self to the time machine. However he manages to get some info on the Fizzle Bomber and gives them to Robertson back 1864 when Jane had her baby. He then takes Jane's baby girl and brings her to the 1945 orphanage. He goes back to 1963 to get John and explains that himself, John, Jane, and the child is in fact the same person, a unique paradox in time. Also it's needed that the agent tricked John with Jane. The agent then takes John to the 1985 Temporal Bureau so John can start his job as the young agent. The agent then gets decommissioned, and chooses to live in 1975 New York. Before he goes, Robertson gives him his own own info on the Fizzle bomber. So when he finds that his time machine doesn't decommission properly, he continues on searching for the bomber using the info. He finds him, and it turns out that the Fizzle Bomber is actually his future self, claiming to have saved lives from the crimes his old self prevented. The agent kills the bomber. But he knows that he must go on as the bomber to ensure his past self's existence.I must admit that I was kind of shocked to find that actually this has more than one movie about time travel with a witty and intriguing story. The old joke of asking ""what comes first, the egg or the chicken?"" really takes it's meaning philosophically and literally in this movie, and so does the concept of a snake eating its own tail. What's nice is that the story can have it's mystery element feels so dense with all those technical setting done just at the right combination. The coloration selection, the scenes which often dominantly feel lonely, and all the dim lighting used in this movie enable it to achieve its intended mystery.The movie can quite play on the viewers anticipation. As soon as the first act starts, we will be tempted to think that the Unmarried Mother is the Fizzle Bomber. But that assumption is broken at the end of the first act. But then all assumptions are shattered right at the very end when the agent is faced at the forced existence of his crimes to ensure himself preventing them.Although the story in this movie is not as elaborate and involving as the almost three-hour long Interstellar (2014), But Predestination (2014) has a story that really can match the complexity and mind bending aspects of any great time travel mystery movie. The only weakness in this movie for me is that it takes too much time in developing the character Jane in its first act, On the other hand, the movie itself is only a little bit longer than ninety minutes, thus we see the character John feels only like the shadow of Jane as he is only seen mostly narrating Jane's part of the character's life, whereas John should have a more significant screen time as the younger temporal agent. The acting side in overall is a good job for me. I like how Ethan Hawke stayed nicely on his character and not even once giving any hint that he knows who Jane and John really is. Sarah Snook is also worthy of praise. Her acting as both Jane and John with visible distinction. Noah Taylor did well in his role that gives the viewers a kind of anchor within the different back and forth time frames that doesn't have distinctive difference.For me Predestination (2014) deserves a 7 out of 10 score, and a quick yes for a recommendation. It's one more time travel movie with deep and witty story with a nice pace.",Predestination
55,Matt_Layden,Check This One Out Before People Start Talking About It.,7,7 January 2015,"The Spierig brothers first came onto the scene with a film entirely funded by themselves and their friends. This was the Australian horror zombie fest Undead. While the film had an annoying lead character and some tone & pacing issues, it was pretty clear that these guys had some serious talent. I expected big things from them in the future and 6 years later they came back with the genre flick, Daybreakers. Daybreakers came just after the sexy leading man vampire of film (Twilight) and television (The Vampire Diaries). So it was nice to see the gruesome, bloody, ugly creatures that they are come about in this film, which has an interesting enough premise to warrant a watch. Well, almost another 6 years later, the brother are at it again, with Ethan Hawke at their side for the second time, with their sci/fi time travel picture; Predestination. Hawke plays a temporal agent, a man with the task of going through time to try and stop catastrophes before they happen. He's tracking down a man known as 'The Fizzle Bomber', responsible for the death of thousands of people in more than a dozen bombings. His next bombing will apparently kill over 10,000 people in New York. If this sounds similar, it's because this story has been done to death in time travel films. Someone has to go back, multiple times, to try and stop a bad guy from doing a bad thing; Source Code, Terminator, every other time travel film. Now while the premise of the film seems redundant, everything else about the film is not. I promise you, you've never seen anything like this film before. I won't go into detail about the story plots of the film, anything I say will ruin the twists and turns the film throws at you. Yet the one fundamental flaw the film has is the fact that it is a time travel film. People will go into this film, I know I did, with theories about this and that, way before there are any hints of it in the film. Predestination suffers from this and it doesn't help that the Spierig brothers drop pretty blatant clues in the first act. I caught them pretty clearly, which made me guess certain things...but here's the weird part; even though guesses came true, I still sat there dumbfounded at what I was watching. Hawke is pretty great here, he gets the opportunity to have some fun in certain scenes and lead with some heavy drama in others. The guy is hard to peg, he certainly does love his genre films though. Even though he hasn't done anything to really wow me yet, I find his films to be entertaining enough and a lot of it has to do with his abilities on the screen. Yet the real standout here is the fresh faced Sarah Snook, who undoubtedly has the hardest task here. The backstory behind her character is tragic, weird, gross, mysterious...she pulls all of this off nicely and I look forward to seeing more of her work.Well shot, but from my experience that is to be expected. The film's premise would make you believe that the film has a lot of action, chase sequences and shootouts. Yet there is hardly a whisper of that. This is a deliberately slow paced film, yet it never drags. Despite the film being about Hawke pursuing a bomber, the brothers are not interested in that aspect. They would rather have the film pursue other means and themes, such as love, identity and purpose. Predestination wraps itself in all of this and more. I don't expect this film to make a big splash anywhere, yet I can tell it will have a cult following. I enjoyed the film, I found myself coming up with some of the craziest scenarios that could happen and smiled when most of them were right on the nose. Predestination is a fun, stylized science fiction film and should be seen by more people. Check it out.",Predestination

But it's not just the chicken & egg nature of the time travel conundrum/paradox. After a straightforward chase scene and preparation for the next mission, an odd narration takes over. For about twenty minutes I was left wondering what's happening here? At the same time the lead actor is left without dialogue, just reacting to the narration, which felt a bit forced.Another problem with the storytelling was that the jumping around in time forced a quick series of flashbacks near the end to make sure the audience wasn't totally confused.They should have had a sex scene - a foursome where Hawke boffs Hawke and Snook boffs Snook, followed by a switcheroo.

57,Sergeant_Tibbs,Thoroughly entertaining and thought-provoking despite its flaws. Sarah Snook is a discovery.,7,9 January 2015,"The Spierig brothers' previous film with Ethan Hawke Daybreakers always looked like a tempting dish. Pehaps an entertaining, dark, surprising vampire movie, as trite as the genre has become. Now Predestination proves I should've given it a go. However, it's a shame that the brothers delegate themselves to such clichéd framing devices for their high concept ideas, as derivative as they may be themselves. It's hard to believe anyone would act the way the characters do. But at the very least, it's cinematic and it's consistent, embracing the contrivances and making them it's own. Predestination immediately wraps you up in it's intensity with its tight photography and editing. This is the kind of stuff that the Wachowski siblings or Christopher Nolan should be doing. The film's style is immediately reminiscent of Inception and Looper sharing the same brooding glimmer. The real revelation is Sarah Snook, who whips the film away from Hawke's hands with pleasure in an incredible transformative performance. It's a campy film, but thoroughly absorbing and fascinating on ideas of identity, gender and self-destruction, as absurd as they may be. Probably my favourite sci-fi of the year, though half of it has little to do with its technology.7/10",Predestination

59,Troy_Campbell,This year's Looper or Inception.,9,3 September 2014,"Twisty, turny and mind-bending, one viewing won't be enough for this time travelling head scratcher. Two plots – one revolving around Ethan Hawke's temporal agent seeking to stop a terrorist, the other following the life of a precocious orphan who isn't quite like everybody else – are intricately and intelligently woven together to not only build tension but to explore provocative themes to spoiler-y to mention here. In fact, Predestination is one of those movies its hard to say much of anything about. It's such a meticulously drip-fed thriller – slowly and superbly unravelling as each and every minute of the runtime ticks on – that the real joy here is unwrapping and grasping (or attempting to any rate) what it is you're actually witnessing. In his second collaboration with Aussie filmmakers the Spierig Brothers, Hawke is in career-best form as the veteran time traveller on the brink of burning out, whilst relative newcomer Sarah Snook (born and bred South Australian) is outstanding in a complex and demanding role that has rightly grabbed the attention of Hollywood. The Spierig's also demonstrate their diversity in both the writing and directing departments, going from the enjoyable but tonally lightweight splatter-fest Daybreakers to this altogether more mature, thematically heavy and narratively elaborate sci-fi saga that still manages to maintain a high excitement level. This year's Looper or Inception.",Predestination

61,Prashast_Singh,I was predestined to love this film.,10,6 August 2020,"As expected, Predestination is an intelligent masterpiece. It's an original, creative, imaginative, fun time-travel epic that must be seen at least once in life. Not just the concept, even the performances will leave your breathless, especially from Sarah Snook: I was really shocked and I don't want to say why, or how. I'll leave that for you to experience yourself. And Ethan Hawke is of course brilliant: he delivers the dialogue effectively and shows his acting chops with finesse.The film has a perfect blend of well-choreographed action, touching drama and surprising twists as it unfolds. The best thing about the film is it's not too convoluted or hard to follow. The makers have done a really great job at handling this and have tried to keep it as simple as possible to understand. It's the ending, however, that left me by surprise. I'd myself predicted a number of possible twists but to be honest, none of them came true. It's that unpredictable!At the end of the day, Predestination is an exciting and engaging sci-fi action thriller that will pull you into the premise and its atmosphere, and you won't even realize when 90 minutes will fly by. This is indeed a thoughtful movie and by the time it will end, you'd have realized that you were predestined to be thrilled. Don't expect the film to leave you with all answers, though. It will interact with you, it will want you to piece together every bit of the story, and that's where it truly wins.",Predestination

64,Stephen_A_Abell,"Not The Best Time Travel Movie, Though One Of The Better Acted And Told.",8,27 April 2017,"This is a very well sculptured and acted time travelling tale about an agent who is on his final mission to stop the fizzle bomber. Throughout all his travels back in time, the bomber has always appeared to be one step ahead of him.The Spierig Brothers, Michael and Peter, wrote a nicely crafted and layered story based on the Robert A Heinlein's story ""All you zombies"". As directors, they do a fantastic job of bringing the story to the screen and getting the best out of their actors. I've always rated Ethan Hawke and here he excels as The Barkeep; the agent on his last assignment. Along with Sarah Snook, who is brilliant as The Unmarried Mother, they add a touch of class to the movie.This is not an action-packed movie as it relies on the story rather than glossy special effects and fight scenes. At times, it's slow and thought-provoking as the audience is slowly immersed in an emerging mystery. The climax makes Oldboy's seem tame in comparison.There is absolutely nothing wrong with this film...Except for one thing...From H G Wells' The Time Machine to Doctor Who to Back To The Future to Dr Who there's been one absolute that a time traveller must not do... but they always do... The paradox. Unfortunately, if you like science fiction and time travel then you will probably figure out the ending of the film before it comes. I had an inkling in the first scene. Then, by the twentieth minute, I'd got most of it figured out. Ten minutes after that I understood. Which left two-thirds of the film left to go.However, this wasn't much of an issue as the film pretty much carries itself strongly throughout and I enjoyed every minute of it, right up to the chilling finale.This is not a film for everybody, though if you don't mind the slower dramatic style of movie-making then you should enjoy this film.",Predestination
65,brchthethird,Mind. Blown.,9,24 January 2015,"I honestly had no idea what to expect going into this movie. All I really knew was that it was directed by the Spierig Brothers, starred Ethan Hawke and had something to do with time travel. Boy, was I in for a surprise! Based on the short story, ""All You Zombies"" by Robert Heinlein (which I haven't read, but now kind of want to), it follows a Temporal Agent (fancy term for 'time traveler') played by Ethan Hawke who is on his last mission to track down a mass murderer known as ""The Fizzle Bomber."" Part of his cover involves working at a bar, and one night this man comes in and tells him a story. After this, the story takes a number of twists and turns which I won't spoil. In fact, this movie works best if you go in with little to no prior knowledge of what it's about. Suffice it to say, I thought that this was a wholly original take on the time travel paradox that also takes a look at the concept of identity (take that for whatever you want it to mean...). However, none of this would make a difference if the performances weren't also top-notch. Ethan Hawke, Noah Taylor, and most importantly, Sarah Snook, do excellent work here. I also liked how natural and low-tech the sci-fi elements were, which made the concept even more believable. Overall, this is the first nice surprise of 2015 and I highly recommend that you see it for yourself.",Predestination

69,eminkl,Flawed but daring,8,18 April 2020,"Under-the-radar, concept-driven science fiction with a heavy dose of suspense. Ethan Hawke plays a decade-leaping ""temporal agent,"" dedicated to stopping the spree of a mysterious mass bomber who wipes out several blocks of New York City in the late 20th century. Along the way, he randomly stops by a bar in 1978 where he settles in to share stories with a down-on-his-luck patron and the plot seems to derail. It's strange, confusing pacing that sets aside the core concept in lieu of a very long, seemingly-unrelated aside, but naturally there's more here than meets the eye. That digression is an intriguing one, albeit in a completely different vein than the advertised premise, and tucks neatly into the endgame during the film's chaotic, full-throttle closing act. Fans of Total Recall and Inception will find themselves mesmerized by the percussive power of its late plot twists, even if they are made a hair less ambiguous than I think was really necessary. These are some pretty big swings, and they'll probably turn off a good portion of the audience, but I enjoy that kind of risk-taking and it feels like they transform what had been a mediocre also-ran into something much closer to the remarkable. Flawed but daring, those last ten minutes are a helluva rush.",Predestination

If you found that cool in Gilliam, you'll find it at least as cool, and probably more cool, here.And... It's a truly touching story.

71,gregsrants,Brilliant,9,23 October 2014,"Brilliant. Thought-provoking mind bending brilliance.  Coming under the radar and screening on Tuesday night as part of the  Toronto After Dark Film Festival schedule, Predestination stars Ethan  Hawke (Sinister) in a film that caught us off guard and sent us home  with the reality of just witnessing one of the best films of the year.  Ethan Hawke plays a character without name who is a time-travelling  agent for a secret agency that uses their ability to transport to  specific dates as an opportunity to stop crime. Hawkes character (known  as The Bartender) is on the tail end of his career. And on his final  assignment, he is tasked with stopping the ""Fizzle Bomber"", a terrorist  that exploded a bomb in New York City in 1975 that killed over 11,000  citizens. The bartender had a chance to stop the bomber once before but  failed and now after a recuperating after his final jump, he jumps from  1960's through the 70's, 80's and 90's to achieve his final objective.  The time travel machine used to jump is basic and brilliant in its  simplicity  a violin case where the adjustment of the numbered and  lettered locking mechanism determines the date to which one will  travel. It is during an early jump that Hawkes character finds himself  in the 1960's acting as a bartender in a small dive bar. It's here  where he meets the character played by Sarah Snook (again, no name is  given for the character just the description ""The Unmarried Mother"").  The two main characters begin a conversation that is part Tarantino  part Mamet in its delivery and genius. The Unmarried Mother begins to  weave a tale so unbelievable that it's mesmerizing to hear it unravel.  The bartender does not seem as overly surprised at the details and at  the conclusion of the anguishing story, he offers the Unmarried Mother  an opportunity to go back in time to face the person which caused her  such grief.  The time jump of the two characters sets the timeline path for a story  that goes in directions that will be completely unseen. By the time the  Unmarried Mother meets her oppressor and the Bartender confronts the  Fizzle Bomber the directing duo of the of Spierig Brothers (Peter and  Michael) have laid out a complex plot of intersecting stories best  described as a ""snake eating its own tail."" Ethan Hawke has worked with  the Spierig Brothers before with 2009's Daybreakers which this reviewer  thought was a well above average tale of vampires in a futuristic  world. But with Predestination the collaborative efforts of the  brothers and Hawke have created a brilliant time travel science fiction  film that betters Rian Johnson's Looper in its vision and execution.  Predestination is a movie where washroom breaks are not recommended.  Every detail of the story circles back to the wonderful final reveal.  It's a film that commands attention and then rewards the viewer for the  courtesy.  When the year finally comes to a close, we will have screened over 200  films released in 2014. Predestination is sure to be on our list of Top  10 when the tallies are constructed.",Predestination

But one thing is for sure, you haven't seen anything like 'Predestination'. This unflinching film takes the time-travel genre to new heights and has a more affectionate story line than most of these sci-fi time-travel films tend to show. 'Predestination' is an adaptation of Robert A. Heinlein's short story 'All you Zombies' from 1959.He wrote the story in one day and is one of his better short stories that tears at the heart strings as well as show his unique story telling methods and creative worlds he writes about. Directed by the Spierig brothers ('Daybreakers' and 'Undead'), 'Predestination' follows a guy (Ethan Hawke), whose name we don't know, who works as a bartender, making craft cocktails and engaging with his regular and new customers. However, there is more to this man that he lets on. In fact, he is a temporal agent who works for the Temporal Bureau, where he and other agents time-travel to stop the most violent and vicious crimes committed around the world.These agents are almost always successful in their missions, but for the bartender, there has always been one person who has eluded him each time. This villain is known as 'The Fizzle Bomber' and is responsible for killing thousands of people. Even 'The Fizzle Bomber' got the best our faithful bartender once, causing him to be disfigured, but due to plastic surgery, has a new face. One day, a new customer comes into the bar and tells a very compelling story to the bartender. It's a story so surprising and insane, that the bartender has never heard anything like it before, although some aspects of this stranger's story seem recognizable.The Spierig brothers have done a magnificent job here, weaving and molding this complex story full of twists and turns, where everything matters and comes into play into a cohesive and compelling story. There are some thrilling scenes, a few dark and ultra violent moments, and some very odd and disgusting scenarios played out here. But each aspect is told with grace and with full consistency that each emotion and plot play out perfectly. From what I described above, it doesn't seem like there is much going on here, but rest assured, this is a heavy and intricate tale of self discovery, which hasn't been done in the fashion ever before.The Spierig brothers also did a phenomenal job of telling a story that comes full circle in a way that will cause you to go back and re-watch every second of this film to see if you could have predicted the outcome if you just looked a little harder. Even the biggest cinephiles here will be impressed. Both Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook own each of their roles, delivering a great range of emotions and physical attributes to their characters. 'Predestination' is such a well conceived and executed story and film, that you'll find yourself going back again and again to see if you can pick up something that you didn't notice before. Along with the great visual effects, excellent acting, and brilliant story line, this film should be high on your list.",Predestination

77,Likes_Ninjas90,"If you can keep up with all of this, and don't feel bad if you don't, its unpredictability is intriguing at times",5,28 August 2014,"Michael Spierig and Peter Spierig, the directors of Predestination, are identical twins who were born in Germany in 1976. They moved to Sydney and then Brisbane in the 1980s, where they both received a Bachelor's degree from the Queensland College of Art. They have directed television ads and short films about zombies but it was their Australian zombie feature film Undead which gave them a cult status. Some drew comparisons between their work and Peter Jackson when he was a low budget horror filmmaker. They followed up Undead with a vampire film Daybreakers which starred Ethan Hawke. These are monster features and genre films but it must be asked whether these films mirror personal experiences of the twins. Films about zombies and vampires are about losing one's identity and humanity and the power of social conditioning. Perhaps some similar emotions are derived from working as twins or maybe they're simply inspired by geek culture. They are fans of Wachowski siblings, praising The Matrix trilogy as one of the greatest sci-fi trilogies ever and naming Bound as one of their favourite films.The comparisons between the Wachowskis and the Spierig twins forges symmetry with how both sets of filmmakers examine gender. As one of the Wachowskis is transgender, their films like Cloud Atlas have provided characters with hidden identities and thoroughly blurred the distinction between male and female characters until the male and female identity is unrecognisable. Predestination is adapted from Robert A. Heinlein's short story All You Zombies. The film features a female character with both male and female genitalia, and is a fair comparison to Cloud Atlas. It also has a bizarre, wild and immensely convoluted narrative that left a lot of people at the media screening scratching their heads. It is described in the film's production notes as being comprised of at least five films rolled into one. It could be more if you were counting properly. It is a science fiction film, a time travel plot, a period piece, a love story, a thriller and an essay on subversive film structure. If you can keep up with all of this, and don't feel bad if you don't, its unpredictability is intriguing at times. At a time when thrillers are comprised of set pieces and bloodless action it deserves full marks for its uniqueness. The story structure is initially linear before it becomes circular, folding in on itself so that scenes are repeated from a different perspective. How much you engage with the characters is dependent on staying with the elusive structure of the plot, best summarised by a line in the film about a snake eating its own tail. While gliding through multiple time periods, the film could not be described as authentic in its recreation of the era. It is more like a hardboiled Noir graphic novel or comic book in the cartoon-like aesthetic applied to the retro 1940s era before moving through several decades up to the 1990s. These shifts are due to the film's lead character The Barkeep (Ethan Hawke), who is a Temporal Agent who travels through time to stop a terrorist bomber. He also works in a bar and is listening to the life story of The Unmarried Mother (Not Suitable for Children's Sarah Snook). Snook's transformation into the downtrodden transgender character, using prosthetics and makeup, casts her as unrecognisable and allows her to vanish into the role. If you also believe that in reading this you've already pieced together the story threads of the narrative it is not even scratching the surface. What doesn't sit as comfortably is the irony of seeing an Australian-made film lose all trace of its own identity because it doesn't look, feel or sound like one. The emphasis on style does not mask some of the storytelling flaws either, specifically the amount of exposition and the way are hovered over, using Snook's voice over to compress them, so the drama doesn't unfold organically. It is an extremely challenging film to discuss in one viewing because it is about being manipulated or disorientated until you lose your sense of yourself. The experience of watching the film is eerily similar. For a mind-altering, gender bending experience, I prefer Pedro Almodovar's science fiction film The Skin I Live In, which is comparable but also cohesive and impactful in a single viewing.",Predestination

79,timdalton007,"""They've Filmed The Unfilmable!""",8,21 August 2015,"From HG Wells' The Time Machine with its various screen adaptations to films like Back To The Future and TV series like Doctor Who, time travel has been a popular theme in science fiction for more than a century now. It's proved to be especially rich ground for those making film and television entries into the genre. Perhaps one of the more remarkable and overlooked takes on the science fiction film is the recent Spierig Brothers film Predestination, itself based on one of the literary tent-poles of the genre.At the film's heart is its two leads performances. Ethan Hawke (who starred in the brothers previous film Daybreakers) plays the mysterious time-traveling agent at the center of the film who is in pursuit of the equally mysterious Fizzle Bomber which takes him to 1970 New York City. It's there that we meet the other protagonist of the film played by Sarah Snook. While Hawke proves himself to be an interesting and underplayed protagonist, the real star of the film is Snook. Her performance in the character of the unmarried mother and the journey she takes through the film is a remarkable one, aided by both a strong script and some excellent make-up. The two of them combined effectively are the film's cast and give the film's many twist and turns a human dimension as we see the effects played out upon them, especially Snook. The duo is wonderfully supported by a sparse supporting cast who pop up from time to time including Noah Taylor as Robertson who heads the time travel agency. As a result, the film is well-acted if nothing else.Though hailed by some for its originality, the fact is that Predestination is in fact based on a nearly sixty year old short story. A friend of mine, upon finding out that the film was based on Robert Heinlein's "" '—All You Zombies—' "" said ""They've filmed the unfilmable!"" Having now read the story, it isn't hard for me to understand that sentiment. It's a complex story with many twists and turns and one that, on the surface would seem impossible to bring to life on screen. Yet the film manages to stay remarkably faithful to the original story in terms of plot and complexity and even manages to bring some of its best moments to life. For something that was supposed to be unfilmable, the Spierig Brothers have done a remarkable job of bringing it to the screen as faithfully as possible.Though the Spierig Brothers do make one notable addition to the film. Perhaps to give its time traveling antics more cohesion, they do add the plot element of the Fizzle Bomber. This addition, and the twists that go with it, don't detract from the Heinlen story. In fact it might actually help the film considerably. With the addition of a mystery to the plot and slightly more action element that comes with it, the film gives the original Heinlen story both more relevancy to a modern audience and something that perhaps also gives it a bit more direction as well.For all these reasons, Predestination stands out amongst the pack of recent science fiction films. It's a well-crafted film with strong performances from its duo of leading actors, including a remarkable performance from its leading lady. It also stands out as one of the most faithful adaptations of a literary science-fiction work onto the screen. In both cases, it's a must-see film for fans of the genre and one that will hopefully find the audience it so richly deserves.",Predestination
80,Imdbidia,Totally predictable,6,22 March 2017,"I had great expectations about this film because I love science-fiction and time traveler movies, and also because of the high ratings on IMDb.Predestination has a great atmosphere, great lighting, and a good production. The acting is decent on all parts, but Sarah Snook shows her versatility as actress playing different roles and different life stages with conviction.The movie has a good central idea with interesting ethical embedded questions that some people might find daring (that is my case) and other people might find appalling or even shocking. Also, there is an ambiguity in the film that, at least in my case, kept me wondering whether all was happening in reality, was just a sort of hallucination or perhaps half-half.Unfortunately, neither the ethical questions nor the ambiguity are explored to the fullest and, the worst thing is that the script is predictable is you are an usual science-fiction watcher, even if you aren't, so not especially exciting. Don't take me wrong, this is an enjoyable film to watch, but right in the middle regarding everything except for Snook's brilliant performance.",Predestination

82,billygoat1071,Designed to Overwhelm,9,26 February 2015,"Predestination is one of those films that is impossible to talk about without giving away too much information about the actual plot. The trailers do make it look like it's another saving-the-world premise that uses the concept of time travel. But the actual film has done something much snazzier and thought-provoking than what one's first impression suggests. Firstly, this is more of a neo-noir that transforms itself into a complete mindbender that reveals several twists which sometimes hardly makes any sense, but otherwise made the experience remarkable. Predestination is meant to surprise, playing tricks at the storyline with flummoxing paradoxes and other weird ideas, which makes it the most fascinating Science Fiction movie you'll see in a while.With the vibe of an old school mystery film, the first hour settles with two strangers slowly building up their characters, setting up some sort of strangeness or an asset that might help stopping an attack from a Fizzle Bomber. The audience would expect it as a time-travel adventure, but the high concept is basically used a backdrop for something bigger to come. This film plays around with its characters, their backstories, and their changes; finding a logic within the complex narrative. The big reveal may end up looking silly, otherwise a mind-blowing twist. It doesn't actually matter, anyway, how the storytelling put these pieces together is ultimately impressive enough for a weirdly valuable experience, just like how gunfights and explosions pleasures us in an action film.While the storyline is fascinatingly constructed, the movie does live up with its production. For a B-movie, there is a cool gritty and retro look around, which works excellently for its Sci-Fi/Neo-Noir ambitions and personality. The performances is one of the things that made it work; with Ethan Hawke showing off his usual charisma and grittiness. But the real star here is Sarah Snook who takes a much challenging character that goes through different kinds of level at every turn of the storyline, and she has done all of those turns terrifically.Whether you liked the twist or not, Predestination still manages to amaze. This is a high concept that doesn't compromise on extravagant elements or subplots, all of the story's contents have something to do with the eventual twist. And for that, it instantly makes it a brilliant ride. There's actually nothing thematically transcendent outside the concept, this is just a game that plays with the moviegoers' minds. There may be better mind-bending films out there, but Predestination is one of those that concentrates with the idea. It gets pretty absurd, but the smart direction sure makes it gripping and really fun.",Predestination

84,MattBrady099,Predestination is worth checking out,6,20 April 2015,"It took me a while well actually it took me forever to get around and watch this movie and I'm a bit disappointing...that I didn't watch this sooner.The story to Predestination is about a order to ensure his law enforcement career for all time, a temporal agent must navigate an intricate set of time-travel journeys. But his final assignment pits him against the one man who has eluded him in all times - but to protect his future, he will finally have to stop him.The reason why I didn't get around to seeing this is because I didn't know nothing about it and I have seen different reviews by critics and YouTube Reviewers that didn't make sound anything that interesting so I didn't bother with it. When I was on the plane to New Zealand for a holiday you get those little TV's in front of you that can play TV shows and movies and guest what was playing, yep this movie so I just thought ""F**k it"" and checked it out since it was a long flight and never again will I put a movie to the side, because Predestination is not just good it's freaking great.The directors of the movie Michael Spierig and Peter Spierig who did the 2010 film Day Breakers which by the way I thought was okay and in this movie the two directors did a great job telling a story with it's twist and turns and keeping my interest till the end.Ethan Hawke once again brings a great performance in this movie just like in every movie that he's in and in this one there's no difference.Sarah Snook to me is a unknown star, I haven't seen her in any other movies just this one and let me tell you that this actress needs to be in more stuff because Sarah Snook did an outstanding performance in this movie that most of the movie she carried it.Some people may have predicted the ending to the film but I didn't and I thought it was a really good twist, to those who disagree that's fine but remember it could have been a stupid twist like in some movies today that try to have edge to it's twist or it could have have been way to predictable. Just be grateful. Now for problems and these not a lot but if I have to be nick pick I would say that the movie should have started with Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook character at the bar talking to each other, because if you have seen the movie you know how the movie starts with the big action but as I said before I would have liked it if it started with Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook character at the bar. Besides that the movie overall is worth checking out. The writing was smart, the acting was all good and it may not get the attention that it deserves but it will one day.",Predestination

87,frukuk,Flawed (inevitably?),5,22 February 2021,"A wonderfully entertaining film -- and the story The Unmarried Mother tells is truly harrowing -- but, after some reflection, I suspect this works much better on the page than on screen.In the original short story by Robert A. Heinlein, on which this film is based, I assume you're left to imagine how the characters of The Unmarried Mother and The Barkeep look and sound. But, once given a physical realisation on screen, it makes it difficult to suspend disbelief. (I can't say more without including spoilers.)So this is a wild, entertaining and disturbing ride as you try to work out the relationship between the various characters.

88,room102,Double Review,7,5 December 2014,"WARNING: Major spoilers ahead - don't read this before watching the movie.-- Review after first watch --Sarah Snook's performance is just incredible. During the entire movie I couldn't tell whether she plays both characters or whether it's an actual male actor with similar looks (I thought it might be Dane DeHaan from The Amazing Spider-Man 2 - they look quite alike). IMO this is an amazing performance - Oscar worthy. Bravo to her and to the makeup artists.The movie itself has plot holes and obviously some major time paradoxes, which obviously is the point of the film. The plot itself is original and interesting while not really making sense - all at the same time. I think the movie works mainly due to the excellent performance and the ""experimenting"" with time travel and the what-if-you-get-back-in-time- and-kill-you-grandfather paradox.6/10 Highly recommended-- Review after second watch --Brilliant. Even better than the first watch. The second watch help me realize how great the movie is and it let me enjoy it even more than in the first watch.Amazing performance, cinematography, makeup and direction, good score. And the writing is just brilliant - there are so many clues, which are right in front of you but you can only get them on the second watch. I like how they thought of almost anything and gave an explanation to everything and every difficulty or paradox without trying to avoid it. The idea of predestination (as the title suggests) is handled very well here and I like how all the stuff fits into the puzzle - again and again the characters WANT to change the cycle and you think it's going to happen, but you're given the reasons why it doesn't happen and everything happens the way it was and the was it will again and again, and the movie gives you the answers without trying to avoid them. I'm not sure how much of that was in the original story by Robert A. Heinlein and how much was invented by the Spierig Brothers, but in any case it's brilliant.I don't know why this movie went so low beneath the radar and had such a TERRIBLE release, which I'm sure will hurt its chance to win some Oscars - I won't be surprised if it won't be nominated even for one, which is more than a shame - it deserves a few, first and for all for Sarah Snook and the makeup artists. Another fact that can definitely hurt the movie is the fact that it's Australian, not American.I like the fact the story deals with two transformation (from Jane to John and from John to the older John), two ""time cycles"" (one to the past and one to the future) which interweave and two revelations: Jane finds out who John is and John finds out who the older John is. It's like two great stories interwoven into each other. Two great plot twists THAT ACTUALLY WORK, in the same movie. Just brilliant.Side note: Sarah Snook seems like a mix between Emma Stone, Jodie Foster and Ellen Barkin.7/10 Brilliant, one of the best movies of 2014 and it might get a higher rating the next time I watch it",Predestination
89,ericrnolan,"A short review of ""Predestination"" (2014)",9,11 April 2019,"""Predestination"" is a grim, moody, well directed time travel movie, beautifully performed by Sarah Snook, Ethan Hawke and Noah Taylor. The storytelling style reminded me so much of Christopher Nolan's work that I had to check the credits again to make sure he wasn't at the helm. (Coming from me, that's high praise.) I'd rate ""Predestination"" a 9 out of 10.I don't think this movie is for everyone. It's hard-core sci-fi, adapted from a short story by Robert Heinlein called ""- All You Zombies -,"" and its stranger story elements will challenge the viewer instead of of pleasing them emotionally. (This would be a very confusing choice for a date movie, for example.)And there is a major plot element here that requires so much suspension of disbelief that I think many viewers will be put off by it. (And it doesn't involve the plot-enabling time travel tehcnology.) I truly enjoyed this film, and even I struggled with its plausibility. I feel certain it was easier for Heinlein to get across on the page than for any filmmaker to show on screen. (Would any of us react the way these characters do if we were in the same situation? I don't think the human heart works quite the way the story suggests it does.)Still, this was a very good movie for a science fiction fan. If you are in the mood for something dark, different and demanding, then give it a chance.",Predestination
90,James_De_Bello,7.5/10,7,20 August 2015,"Smart, intelligent and very stimulating, this is one of those special films that, despite not being the perfect package I desperately wanted it to be, deserves respect and admiration all around and offers so many points of discussion and reflection, both regarding the plot and the filmaking behind it, it is difficult not be delighted.I will say that this is one of the best scripts of the year and gives ""Ex Machina"" a run for its money. It has its limitations, that are highlighted by some directing choices, which I will get into later, but looking into it I really admire what the writers managed to get onto page. With such a complicated storyline to get through it is astonishing to see you never get lost and you are always given the exact pieces of information needed plus the perfect beats where to breathe, recollect and then get back into it again. I cannot make heads or tails of how someone starts to think and elaborate this plot, let alone get it on paper. The best part is that it is actually a fascinating story, with interesting developments, no cop outs and twists that make the storytelling go deeper and dig more emotion.Other than that we also have a movie with very solid performances by both its leads. Ethan Hawke is one of those actors who doesn't get mentioned enough and as soon as he appears on screen he always reminds me why I admire him so much. He has a very recognizable face, but no matter what he always manages to disappear in the character and give him a unique presence. The score is also engrossing and the editing is brilliant, you really don't realize it is there unless you think of it and that makes it even more successful.Where the movie trips is basically in its themes: endurance of love, perception of time, meaning of time and ironically, but most importantly, predestination. They struggle to emerge throughout, given also the fact that the story is always having the majority of screen time and be it noted that it needs that screen time to develop, and are ultimately not delivered especially because of an needlessly abrupt ending. I think that the point in which the movie ends might even be OK but I don't see why it was so accelerated towards the end, there really could have been fifteen minutes more and that is probably the first time I ever say that for a movie. Basically the end point of the film relies very heavily on what the film is about thematically, but we are never given the time and material to grasp those themes and digest them fully so when we come down to the finale we are left with a little uncertainty on what we should be shocked about.When it comes down to it this is a worthy science fiction film with a very solid emotional core yet thematically it fails to achieve what could have brought this to the next level.",Predestination

I cant shut off the mind that has sunk into the depths of such a genre as ""sci-fi"" because to that same mind it is only ""sci possible"" and so I foresaw too much of this coming. Did this ruin the film? Not really. It speaks volumes of the character of actors in such a film, whom chose to be in it, almost like they knew the outcome of the endeavor. BLAH BLAH! And so on lol.

Initially he's a deeply depressed and tortured soul. Then as the barkeep he is happy-go- lucky and casual. Too much of a change for me.The story in the bar was continually interesting.We get to the actual time travel and the film starts to waiver. Snook is going to kill the guy who ruined her life. But she really didn't grasp that it was her all along? (I can forgive that, though.)It really was mind-blowing that Snook falls in love with her other character. Never seen that in a film I can think of. Very freaky and compelling.And the kid. Wow! I was thinking it was the younger Hawke. But they took that extra step.There's the Fizzle Bomber, who was also Hawke later in life who had gone crazy. Now if he didn't get the bomber in that one instance, why not just try again at that one instance, being time travel and all? No trying at different times. And the laundromat scene was just desperation to wrap up that one angle.Now the HUGE paradox. There was no beginning to the Snook/Hawke character. None. She/he conceived in the middle of their life and deposited at the beginning of the story. Sure, they threw out the chicken and the egg scenario, but that wasn't enough.Maybe there's some vast philosophical underpinning that I'm missing. But I doubt it. It was simply some really interesting stuff that will stay with me for awhile that made absolutely no logical sense.",Predestination

The originality of this creative tale alongside the skilful staging of Snook and Hawke are why Predestination lives up to each of it's deserved rewards and ratings.

The last one (Daybreakers) was already 5 years ago. The one before that (Undead) was 6 years before. It's best you know as little as possible about Predestination to enjoy it to the fullest. It's mostly story driven and will keep you on the edge of your seat for most of it's running time. The screenplay is based on Robert A. Heinlein short story 'All you Zombies' (wouldn't that be a great film title!) -written by Heinlein in one day no less- which revolves about Time travel paradoxes. The Spierig brothers got to work with Hawke again, an actor who knows how act in service of the story and delivers big time.

Apart from Robert Heinlein being an excellent storyteller (see other movies adapted from his work; his stories are excellent material for movies), this movie is a fantastic example of how to put all the aspects of a movie (casting, performances, music, direction, editing, cinematography, etc.) together in a perfect fashion.

102,digdog-785-717538,a different kind of review,5,9 December 2014,"Spoilers Ahoy!!!So you have watched the film, and you have read the reviews. And sure enough most of the people talking about this film focus their attention on the logic of the events and the time-travel paradoxes. What if she didn't do this or that? Why would he not do this or that?But my point of view has nothing to do with any of the above.Predestination is an average length film whose first 52 minutes are spent between two actors talking; the story they speak of is the background of the film, but nevertheless, it's a whopping half of the film. By the time the much awaited time travel happens, you know there won't be much action in the film.After said nearly-an-hour of dialogue, there are a few brief scuffles but they clearly feel like a token action sequence got throw in for good measure. There is a brief twenty minutes of hurried development, where the rest of the plot is laid bare for those five or six guys in the audience who didn't get it yet.Now i promised i wouldn't go in detail with the paradox, so i'll keep it very brief. The characters are all different versions of the same person - a common enough theme in time-travel films. The actions which lead to the development of the plot are completely irrational, and they only and exclusively serve to drive the plot forward.Then there is the conclusion, which i'm sure the director thought it was poignant - full of sophisticated, existentialist meaning.. but it's not. The plot on its own makes sense from a purely mechanical point of view, but just like the horror film cliché where the dumb girl dies first or the hero goes in the dark room alone, the plot *is* the story. If the characters at any point chose instead to not perform an action, there would no longer be a story, as any other loop-based script (i believe John McLane was in something similar, a little while back?), there is nothing driving the characters forward if not themselves.I watched this film and i honestly knew the end by the half hour mark. Ethan Hawke is a charming actor and watching him do his classic dark role is a pleasure, but the film has zero talent for making you wonder what will happen next. In my opinion, Predestination is5/10 - a complete waste of time.",Predestination

106,Christopher_Reid,"An interesting idea, done quite well",7,28 May 2018,"I was so confused with the first half of this movie. I thought it was meant to be a sci-fi time travel thriller. But we get this biographical story for a large part of the running time. It's engaging, but makes you wonder - where is all this leading? What is this movie even about? Is this the right disc I inserted?Ultimately, I don't think it has any one clear message or point. But it's thought-provoking. It asks a lot of interesting ""what if"" questions. There are plenty of surprises and twists. It raises moral questions about the costs when trying to save lives. And about doing things which cause pain but knowing that you have to do them anyway. One underlying thread is the eternal question of the chicken and the egg and of male vs. female.The movie doesn't really make sense when deeply scrutinised. But it doesn't have to. The plot holds together, but it's unrealistic. But that's okay. It's abstract. It's about pondering these made-up ideas. It takes hypothetical time travel scenarios to their logical extreme. It could've been more concrete and had more of a connection to some kind of purposeful series of events, but it's works for what it is.The acting and directing are good. I like the tone overall. It's an easy movie to relax into, not trying too hard to entertain or preach or blow you away. It just takes you in with a fascinating story which raises a lot of questions. I can't remember the music, meaning it probably did its job without being either terrible or great.So I recommend this movie to people who like intricate stories with well-developed characters. However, it doesn't really lead anywhere profound. It's more about the journey itself and some general themes about existence, choice and identity. It's more of an interesting dream than a realistic story which can be taken seriously. And it's flawed and maybe even a little self-indulgent. But at least it's pretty unique and well made.",Predestination
107,santiagocosme,Was it the chicken? Was it the Egg?,5,13 December 2014,"I would love to say the most positive things about this movie because, at least, they are trying to mess up with your mind and they are trying to do it with a new approach. The problem is that they don't really achieve that, and for all the twists and turns they want to create in your viewing experience, the fact is that you could see how this film would end from miles and miles away. In this time traveling adventure, there's only one thing to decipher: What does connect all the characters? Simply that they are the same person. Yes, the waiter talking to a weird-woman- turned-man-after-a-sex-operation in a bar are the same person. The abandoned baby she talks about, same person. The ""Fizzle Bomber"" that the undercover-agent-turned-waiter is trying to catch. It's the same person... All of it due to time traveling and coming across themselves in the past which affects the present time. Several characters, same person.The only problem is that when you think a little there's a massive problem. How did this person come to be in the first place? It did not start with that baby left at an orphanage...So, there's just no answer, because there's no logic, and that's why this movie, in my opinion, does not deserve a better rating.I enjoyed watching it but I felt really disappointed at having deciphered the movie so easily.

109,headly66,All You Zombies giving this a 10 should rethink,5,24 November 2014,"Predestination is a very faithful telling of a 1958 short story by Robert A. Heinlein called All You Zombies, and as it was written in one day it leaves a lot to be desired in filling plot holes and explanations.I will not go into a detailed dissection of the plot as I do feel this is a decent movie that should be viewed, but not more than once and here is the reason. The SHOCK ending revealing that the main characters are all the same person was no shock to me as I figured it out halfway through and I have never read the original story.Several things gave it away such as never revealing the face of the bomber and it was obvious that the burn victim was the woman being helped by herself in the repeat of the opening scene 30 minutes before the ending.What is most bothersome it the lack of explanation of the origins of the time travel machine, the Temporal Bureau and why they are doing this all to begin with.Well acted and directed but not a fully fleshed out film.",Predestination
110,mgruebel,Good Heinlein adaptation,7,24 February 2015,"One way to solve the time travel paradox is to have a hermaphrodite as a male travel back to the past to impregnate herself before the sex change operation, steal the baby and drop it off even earlier in time to grow up into the impregnated girl that then has a sex-change operation.The death part can also be neatly taken care of if the hermaphrodite is then burned in the face so as not to recognize his later self, who recruits him to the very time travel agency that makes it possible for him to impregnate herself, whereupon he shoots himself to end the loop before traveling back in time to burn his face, and wait to live to be killed.That sums up the plot, which is as brittle as all time travel stories are, but in Heinlein-fashion hole-free. It appears the Aussie scriptwriters stuck close to the master's template. After seeing the face operation at the beginning, and hearing the first few minutes of the post-sex change time traveler's tale in the bar, the rest of the plot was obvious. Some people strangely consider this transparency a weakness, but since there's only one way to tie up the plot, I think it's a compliment.The real joy of this film is not to guess the next move, but to relish in its inevitability. The story really just has three actors in it, two of them playing the same person. Sarah Snook is the real star as the female and young male hermaphrodite, and Ethan Hawk provides great support as the older half of the loop. In the end, films are only interesting if the characters are interesting, and here they certainly are!The film should have embraced its inevitability more, and not hidden from the viewer by cheap tricks who was who when. Just show it all, starting with the Caesarian section scar on the older male self. This is where a great auteur like Hitchcock stands out: he feels no need to hide from you exactly what happens the moment it happens because that element of surprise is unimportant. It's the cat-and-mouse game where the viewer knows but the characters don't (yet) that makes Hitchcock so enduring. So 7/10 it is because a film that relies on doling out all-to-transparent secrets can't be seen over and over again, even if the whole thing is a never-ending loop.",Predestination
111,stephendaxter,A unique and compelling take on time travel,8,27 November 2014,"Predestination was one of the more original and creative films of the last few years, the Spierig brothers i feel made themselves known to the movie world with this unique concept and take on time travel. Everything from the storytelling to the acting performances were fantastically executed keeping you engaged from the very beginning to the very end. Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook really shine as they bring these characters to life in a way that makes them interesting to watch and you can really feel for them in this film. They both have just given us one of their best performances of their careers so far. The film itself is full of twists and turns that will keep you invested until the closing scene. One thing this film does very well is the way it explained time travel and made it make sense with very minimal plot holes, something that is hard to do when dealing with such a concept. This was a compelling and unique film with fantastic acting performances that i think deserves a lot of praise from the more mainstream movie community.",Predestination
112,mohit_sinsniwal,'Predestination' deserves more recognition.,8,26 May 2019,"Brilliant. Thought-provoking mind bending brilliance. Coming under the radar and screening on Tuesday night as part of the Toronto After Dark Film Festival schedule, Predestination stars Ethan Hawke (Sinister) in a film that caught us off guard and sent us home with the reality of just witnessing one of the best films of the year. Ethan Hawke plays a character without name who is a time-travelling agent for a secret agency that uses their ability to transport to specific dates as an opportunity to stop crime. Hawkes character (known as The Bartender) is on the tail end of his career. And on his final assignment, he is tasked with stopping the ""Fizzle Bomber"", a terrorist that exploded a bomb in New York City in 1975 that killed over 11,000 citizens. The bartender had a chance to stop the bomber once before but failed and now after a recuperating after his final jump, he jumps from 1960's through the 70's, 80's and 90's to achieve his final objective. The time travel machine used to jump is basic and brilliant in its simplicity - a violin case where the adjustment of the numbered and lettered locking mechanism determines the date to which one will travel. It is during an early jump that Hawkes character finds himself in the 1960's acting as a bartender in a small dive bar. It's here where he meets the character played by Sarah Snook (again, no name is given for the character just the description ""The Unmarried Mother""). The two main characters begin a conversation that is part Tarantino part Mamet in its delivery and genius. The Unmarried Mother begins to weave a tale so unbelievable that it's mesmerizing to hear it unravel. The bartender does not seem as overly surprised at the details and at the conclusion of the anguishing story, he offers the Unmarried Mother an opportunity to go back in time to face the person which caused her such grief. The time jump of the two characters sets the timeline path for a story that goes in directions that will be completely unseen. By the time the Unmarried Mother meets her oppressor and the Bartender confronts the Fizzle Bomber the directing duo of the of Spierig Brothers (Peter and Michael) have laid out a complex plot of intersecting stories best described as a ""snake eating its own tail."" Ethan Hawke has worked with the Spierig Brothers before with 2009's Daybreakers which this reviewer thought was a well above average tale of vampires in a futuristic world. But with Predestination the collaborative efforts of the brothers and Hawke have created a brilliant time travel science fiction film that betters Rian Johnson's Looper in its vision and execution. Predestination is a movie where washroom breaks are not recommended. Every detail of the story circles back to the wonderful final reveal. It's a film that commands attention and then rewards the viewer for the courtesy. When the year finally comes to a close, we will have screened over 200 films released in 2014. Predestination is sure to be on our list of Top 10 when the tallies are constructed.",Predestination
113,gcsman,Amazingly close rendition of Heinlein's story,9,2 May 2016,"The screenplay of Predestination claims to be based on a famous short story by Robert Heinlein called 'All You Zombies' and sure enough ... it is! This is one of the most faithful adaptations of a science fiction story to the screen that I've ever seen. (For another, longer story in the same category that's even better, see 'Contact' based on Carl Sagan's novel.) A lot of the script is taken direct and minimally changed from the story, which is probably a testament to how strongly Heinlein's writing was built on conversations between pairs of characters and also, of course, how instantly readable it was. And it definitely helps that the original story was written in the 'good Heinlein' era, when he was spinning off lots of ideas that had immediate appeal.This is a mainly Australian production and I like their habit of concentrating simply on the story and not overwhelming us with special effects as a Hollywood effort might have done. It's got perfectly good production values and good visual effects that are used when appropriate, but the story stays central. After all, it's a good story -- a time-travel theme pushed to the limit of apparent self-contradictions that are mind-spinningly possible given the setup. It didn't need any exaggeration to work well on the screen.Overall, congrats are due to both Heinlein and the production crew for coming up with a winner. As for the actors, it's pretty much a two-person show: Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook carry the bulk of the action and dialog, and they're perfectly fine. Before I saw this movie I made sure to go back and re-read the original story first, and I actually recommend doing that. To some extent it gives away some spoilers, but it made me enjoy the production even more.",Predestination
114,priyantha-bandara,One of the recent best in time travel,9,6 December 2014,"Reviewing this movie is really tricky. Because this movie is not the type that start from the start and end in the end (What am I even saying?). In fact Predestination has no start or an end but though at a glance it does not make any sense it makes a lot of sense once it's done. Predestination could be one of the best science fiction movies based on time travel and predestination paradox theory and it is truly mind boggling shocking piece. To be honest white it feels like Inception (2010) for a while it is standing inch shorter with Primer (2004). And nothing comes close to the feeling this leave you with once your struck by some completely unexpected ending.There is no easy way to explain the plot of Predestination. But let me try. An agent who works for a top secret time travelling agency has the challenge to stop a serial bomber who made devastating damage back in 1970s. In one of his crucial visits to the 70s he meets a man who has a very shocking yet interesting story to tell. While this story makes no sense to one person it makes perfect sense to the other.Obviously the time travelling related theories are pretty complex. And movie makers have come up with lot simpler versions themselves in the name of entertainment. Whatever it is most time travel based movies are quite interesting to watch but hard to explain as such. Predestination is one of those hard to explain type and it is OK to say that it's different to the usual bunch. Based on a short story ""All You Zombies"" back in 1958 the Spierig Brothers who directed Predestination has done a fascinating job at it. The sheer style of storytelling makes this movie somewhat unique for a sci fi and takes more of a dramatic approach for a good deal of time. Though more action could have being awesome I'm glad it doesn't go gun happy like Looper (2012) which again is one of the successful mind bending time travel based sci fi action flick. But the sheer amount of suspense and twists in Predestination make you forget any action for that matter and takes you in a more serious journey through time.My only worry is the lengthy scenes that take place in a bar that at times feel unfit to be in a sci fi viewing it as a fan of sci fi. But taking the movie as a whole if you managed to get through that phase you will realize that it has a crucial part in making the whole plot up so steady though some of it can be reduced to shorted sizes. It seems like directors were keeping the best for later so patience maybe a good idea.Finally keeping a note about performances and cinematography both are very well made. Ethan Hawk who plays the time travelling agent does a fine job at it but the real talent is with Sarah Snook who plays the other character. You will not be impressed of both performances instantly but once the show goes knee deep things will looks different. All in all Predestination is a must watch for Sci Fi fans and certain psychological thriller hungry fans.",Predestination
115,rprince-832-6294,"Pretty Good, but Some Elements That Aren't",7,8 January 2015,"-Predestination is a sci-fi film that follows a man, played by Ethan Hawke, who is tasked with stopping a bomb from going off in New York in the 1970s. Along the way he meets a woman and gets to hear her story. The two discover they have much in common and, without giving anything away, a series of things occur that change the way they look at time and destiny.-Any movie about time travel has its plot-holes in it, but this one lays things out pretty well. It's not too bad of a movie either! -The story seems to be split between the bomb and the woman almost unevenly, but they come together well. The story does get weird though.-The pace is pretty good. A lot of the film is dedicated to one big chunk and it shows, but it doesn't feel slow.-The acting is nothing special, but I think Ethan Hawke did a very good job. I really liked him and his character.-As characters go, there is a lot of depth to the characters and seeing it unfold is pretty cool.-The time travel stuff is also original, in my opinion anyway.-I liked the editing, but none of the actual filmmaking is worth noting that much.-The music is pretty fitting and worth another listen, but it blends in almost too well.-One of the things I did not like about Predestination was one of the, I guess transformations, one of the characters goes through. It's weird in a less-than-likable way.-Predestination holds a light R-rating. It has a heavy PG-13 amount of language, a PG-13 amount of violence, and a PG-13 amount of partial nudity. I guess all three together pushed the rating up.-I like thinking sci-fi movies with cool leads and twists, and Predestination gave me that. Some of the film felt a little forced and I was not a fan of one or two elements, but it was still a really good film. I won't say it's worth seeing in theaters because limited release, but I would definitely pick up Predestination in a $5 bin! I would give it either a strong 7 or low 7.5. I really liked Ethan Hawke's character, so I would probably give it a low 7.5.",Predestination

I was kind of reluctant on seeing this film because I haven't heard much about it and I read a couple of bad reviews on it, but I took a chance and I'm glad I did. This film was remarkable and genius. It really didn't get the credit it deserves. This film doesn't start off slow to build up, it catches you from the very beginning and even thought a huge part of it is one of the characters telling about their life it still keeps you interested. Like some time travel films it'll go in a certain direction and have you in deep thought. Sarah Snook and Ethan Hawke were wonderful in this film. This is by far the best one Sarah Snook has done. She should be proud of herself because I am. The Barkeeper (Ethan Hawke) is an agent on his last mission trying to catch a terrorist. Sounds simple, but some of the simplest things can be more complicated than they look. This is probably one of the best sci-fi films I've seen.",Predestination

120,lois-lane33,A decidedly odd choice for a science fiction adaptation.,6,14 January 2015,"I thought newcomer actress Sarah Snook was good in this film-this bizarre film-that has the female lead played by Sarah Snook-having a relationship with herself across time and gender lines and then also creating a bay in the same situation which ends up being identified by the film as the female lead herself taken back in time by Ethan Hawkes character. That is a paradox within a paradox giving birth to itself. All in all I do find that a creepy idea. Even if it is well dated. Ethan hawk played a major role in this film although he is identified as playing 'the bartender.' That would be technically correct but the film hinges on his part in it. I think it is good to be creative especially i science fiction but at the same time I think they should watch what they put into films like this. I think the film suggests that lengthy hospital stays in young persons are maybe because of latent Hermaphroditism and the resultant 'correctly diagnosed sex change.' I think that is a psychiatric absurdism that hinges on what is considered to be ""normal"" behavior that omits what a person feels about themselves. So the film is sort of also a soft cell for psychiatric BS also. I don't know if it intends to be but it is. It is sort of like saying that what a person feels is not as important as what a persons biology is, which is contra freewill-what has come to represent the whole GLBT thing. The film is a screen adaptation of a classic Robert Heinlein SF story. I only gave it a six because I thought it was something done in order to get praise, as opposed to something done out of a desire to make legitimate ""art.""",Predestination
121,quinnox-1,Silliness echoing across multiple time dimensions,4,21 January 2015,"I'm a time travel and science fiction fan, but this movie was just way too preposterous and nonsensical to take. The plot is laughable, and its basically something you might catch on a really late night playing on the sci-fy channel, that kind of low-rent quality level. The only bright spot is the emergence of a new actress I had never heard of or seen before, the interestingly named Sarah Snook. She does a superb job with her character, and is much better than the movie deserves. I wish the whole movie had centered on her character, and then also had had a halfway decent story line too, instead of the ridiculous plot that is on display. 4 stars for her performance only, even though its wasted in a stinker movie like this one.",Predestination

It started off somewhat slow....BUt the last half of the movie just blows by and it's really intense. I have to admit I couldn't completely follow it, it was a bit too complex with all the time changing. I did get the whole paradox aspect which was achieved very congruently.

123,paul_3-960-896774,Predestination just blew my mind,9,28 January 2015,"I didn't really know what to expect when I watched the film, since I wasn't familiar with the Robert A. Heinlein's source material. The trailers were good but a little weak and now that I've seen the movie I understand why. Predestination is smart. Every piece of the puzzle is perfectly laid out so that the story pulls you in slowly, keeping your mind in sort of laser sharp focus because it's a time-travel movie and usually that's what you need to understand these movies. But in this case that is exactly what will get you fooled. From start to finish, I was so into the story that the craziest of possibilities escaped me. I ate everything they fed me and was left dumbfounded once the story unfolded. I am doing my best not to spoil because the movie is an experience that I would encourage anyone to have. Predestination surpasses expectations and carefully untangles a knotted storyline that will slowly start to take all of its tragic, dramatic sense. Everything makes sense, it all ties together and the same thing goes for the cast, Ethan Hawke, Sarah Snook, and Noah Taylor are amazing. Each of them bring something specific to the table, creating this tight knit story that left me reevaluating everything I saw once an untangled knot in the storyline took its meaning. Sarah Snook & Ethan Hawke's performances brought real emotional weight to the characters they're playing. Particularly, Sarah Snook whose character could have drag this movie down the drain if she wasn't utterly convincing.The sci-fi aspects aside Predestination also touches so many current subjects and could be interpreted and/or seen in so many ways. The story becomes about Jane's emotional journey and her transition into a man and throughout life. There is also something to be said about loving and accepting yourself in the movie but I can't go too deep into that without spoilers.Peter and Michael Spierig delivered a methodical, almost anal retentive film. It's intense, a bit contrite but it's a good film. Predestination is a great take on time travel and fate. A thought- provoking film with an entertaining and complex storyline lead by a great cast. @wornoutspines",Predestination
124,therealjaysmoke,My take on this exceptionally breathtaking masterpiece,10,24 July 2020,"So the first time I watched this movie, I didn't take much into account. So I decided to watch it again and this time paid very close attention. Now I've read some of the comments here and I think many are still missing the story so let me explain what I think is going on here.The movie starts off with Sarah Snook (Unmarried Mother), who is on a mission to find the fizzle bomber, at the same time, the Ethan Hawks (The Barkeep - Unmarried Mother's Body, Ethan's Face), has also traveled back to the same spot to try and stop the fizzle bomber. He gets into a fight with fizzle bomber, gets whooped and fizzle bomber gets into a shooting spree with Unmarried Mother which leads to Unmarried Mother burning his face. The Barkeep comes in and helps him escape. Later on in the movie, you will realize that after this incident, the Barkeep regretted his actions which led to the face burn and had he not jumped to that scene, Unmarried Mother wouldn't have burnt his face and needed a face transplant. So the Barkeep sets out to correct this which is the entire point of the movie IMO. BUT to correct this, he has to correct all the wrongs done from all his previous jumps hence why he had to go back and steal little Jane, meet up with Unmarried Mother and try and correct the hurt caused when he left Old Jane without an explanation. So in so doing, Unmarried Mother realizes he impregnated old Jane so this time he won't sleep with her therefore Old Jane won't give birth and won't find out that she has that condition. And because Unmarried Mother couldn't get into the corporation with her condition, the Barkeep helped her get recruited by jumping her to the future. Then the Barkeep will go back in time, kill the fizzle guy which happened to be the person whose face he is wearing (I think that was just a plot twist that had nothing to do with the main story), Barkeep then takes his identity and lives happily with Alice, which meant that Unmarried Mother, now an agent, will not be sent on that mission to stop Fizzle Bomber where she burnt her face. At the end of the day, the Barkeep completes his final mission and sets things back in order.I hope I made sense 🤣",Predestination

Ethan Hawke is fantastic as the time travelling agent. Ethan has truly come into his own as an actor and it shows with compelling dramatic flare.Sarah Snook is a newcomer; albeit, very good at her part.The plot is fantastic and the movie paces itself very well.

126,eschetic-2,A must for Sci-Fi fans; first class Heinlein from the Spierig Brothers,8,20 December 2014,"PREDESTINATION isn't scheduled for U.S. release until January of 2015, and I strongly prefer to see films for the first time in a movie theatre, but the chance to see an advance copy of what was reputed to be a first class adaptation of a famous Robert A. Heinlein story (""All You Zombies"" although this is not another voguish ""zombie"" film) was far too good to ignore. ""Far too good"" the film certainly is, with great performances, cinematography and adaptation, but commercially it will probably do best with those already predisposed to the best speculative fiction of Robert A. Heinlein (The Past Through Tomorrow and To Sail Beyond The Sunset) or Isaac Asimov (The Foundation and Robot Series).Ethan Hawke, in a performance reminiscent of his career landmark in GATTACA, plays an agent of a secret agency charged with preventing disasters after the fact with the aid of a limited time travel ""McGuffin,"" nearing the end of his career. That is the basic idea underlying what becomes an exceedingly simple variation on the classic ""snake eating its own tail"" story (which is, in fact, alluded to in the story). The story is simple - an intelligent audience familiar with classic time travel fiction with its limitations and paradoxes will guess the gimmick of the story - how the Hawke character came to be and what he will become - easily by half way through the story, but the execution is so beautiful and feels so true that taking the rest of the journey to enjoy the details of the execution remains a delight.Hawke is matched every step of the way by Sarah Snook as a relatively androgynous young man Hawke appears to meet in a bar where he works as cover for his real job. If there is a weak point in the story, it's probably the supposed ""revelation"" that the young man had started life as a woman. Most of us had guessed from the first words out of his/her mouth, but as the story progresses, the very androgyny helps us suspend our disbelief and go with the different aspects of the story as the Spierig brothers reveal the layers of their onion without clinging to chronological order.As third billed Noah Taylor repeatedly assures Hawke that he's the *only* person so uniquely qualified to do the required job, he lets the audience in on a key to the ultimate solution - as well as perhaps inadvertently dropping a hint at a solution to the identity of the mysterious bomber frequently flirted with in time travel detective stories, but seldom pulled off successfully. The fine cool emotional balance between the Hawke and Snook characters adds to the ultimate satisfaction with which this film's final solution and aftermath are handled.The prosaically titled PREDESTINATION is definitely a must see for serious Heinlein and other science fiction fans; an important if relatively minor film worthy of consideration by ANY serious film buff. I doubt that it will be found among the year end list of top grossing films of 2015 or Academy Award nominees in 2016, but it brings enormous credit to both the Spierig Brothers and the industry itself and WILL bring long term satisfaction to the fans who find it. Do try to be in that number!",Predestination

128,murtaza_mma,A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: One heck of a cinematic experience with mind-bending twists and turns,8,30 November 2014,"Predestination is a mess of a film with glaring plot holes and paradoxes (whether deliberate or not, it's an altogether different matter), but it's an intriguing mess that proves to be quite an interesting cinematic experience for the cineastes on the lookout for a breath of fresh air. The endless inconsistencies in the plot don't pose any major impediments unless one is in the habit of nitpicking. Predestination has already been compared to other mind-bending films like ""The Prestige"" and ""Inception"" and while the comparisons may come across as a bit far-fetched there's no denying that it's a film of great ambition that tugs at the heart with its themes of love, solitude, compassion, and sense of duty. The movie beautifully toys with the concept of space time continuum that elevates it to the realms of a typical Kafkaesque conundrum. Ethan Hawke is absolutely brilliant to watch (in a remarkable turn that harks back to Hawke's portrayal in Gattaca) and is well complemented by Sarah Snook who, in some scenes, even succeed in stealing the limelight from the shape-shifting Hawke. Overall, Predestination, proves to be one heck of a cinematic experience. Highly recommended!!! 7.5/10.For more on the world of cinema, please visit my film blogsite:http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",Predestination
129,themissingpatient,An Entertaining Challenge,8,18 April 2015,"Predestination is one of the most thought-provoking science-fiction films to-date. This is not only because of the paradoxes that stories involving time travel challenge us with, but also due to some unsavory, possibility even taboo, subject matter.The first half of the film is a conversation between a bartender and a customer. The customer bets the bartender their life story will be the strangest thing the bartender has ever heard. The bartender, played by Ethan Hawke, is highly doubtful and takes the bet. At this point, we've already come to understand Ethan Hawke's character is not just a bartender, he is a time-traveler. Therefore, we too doubt this customer's story will be anymore shocking or strange as time travel. Where the film goes from here is a mind-bending challenge. Yet, as deep as the story goes in this first half, we are constantly being brought back to a relatable reality, that this is all just a story being told to a bartender.The last half of the film is where the main story gets back on-track. The bartender is really a time-traveling temporal agent who's mission is to stop a terrorist known as The Fizzle Bomber. Things continue to get more mysterious and complex, possibly a little convoluted. Though the relatable aspect of the story is completely lost, what keeps us connected is it's heart, which is both Sarah Snook's performance and character.At it's surface, Predestination is a small, independent science-fiction film about a time-traveler. What you'll soon find, once the film passes it's opening credit, is that you are about to be sucked down a rabbit hole. The story has great depth and is emotionally rich. It's a dialogue-driven character study, while also being a suspenseful thriller. The plot twists do not take away, they add more of a connection between the audience and the characters in the story. The Spierig Brothers have raised the bar on everything a science-fiction film can achieve. And while not everything presented is pleasant, it's an entertaining challenge.",Predestination

What if someone had the ability to travel through time and affect your life at various stages and successfully put you in a time loop? Once such a mission was accomplished, you should never really be able to get out of it.Spoiler AlertPredestination takes this concept and pretty much spanks your brain with it. Not only is the victim in a time loop but crucially, he is convinced that his existence is dependent on the successful continuation of the loop itself. The opposite of going back in time, killing your father and causing yourself to never have existed at all. Why would you not perpetuate your circular existence if you were convinced that it was the only way you could ever exist?As far as the question as to where the loop begins, the only scenario that makes sense to me where the baby taken by the Barkeep to the orphanage is not mother Janes child but is in fact baby Jane herself swiped by Robertson from her real parents and switched with mother Janes child. All the Barkeep is then doing is taking his infant self from the ward to the orphanage.Convince the Barkeep that he is 'special' and born of a Paradox and that it's his mission to perpetuate his existence and he will keep completing the loop, endlessly, forever.",Predestination

After saturating myself with numerous such time-travel movies I mostly stick with a single interpretation for such films nowadays.While judging such films I try to focus just on aspects of film-making rather than the fictitious concept of time travel. 'Predestination' is a fine addition to the genre with a good story alongside the time adventures and great acting by both its leads. I would not like to talk about the plot as it would really enjoyable for you to sit through this one not having any idea about the story and fix the pieces of puzzle as they come. The story has good amount of emotional and rational depth, plus a lot of twist and turns to play with your minds. With a short run time of about 100 minutes, the first half is necessarily taut and the second half is spontaneously rushed. Ethan Hawke has given another strong performance like in 'Boyhood' and Sarah Snook is simply marvelous. Another great thing was the stylish soundtrack by Peter Spierig who is also the director and writer along with his brother Michael. Technically, the cinematography and effects were good. In the end, Predestination is an amazing and enjoyable ride. The time-travel element is extravagantly used leaving you exhausted, but the story never loses its focus. Its gripping and keeps you on your toes guessing what is the next twist. Not to be missed at all by people who love time-travel and sci-fi movies.RATING: [3.5/5]",Predestination
136,evan_harvey,Brilliant,9,28 August 2014,"Short: Australian time travel movie, paradoxes, Ethan Hawk, great writing, well-filmed and directed, might be a little predictable to jaded hacks, mind-blowing.***POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW*** Long: The Australian Spierig brothers just keep getting better and better with every film they make. 'Undead' was a mixed bag of zombie weirdness, but still a great debut. 'Daybreakers' was only a minor classic of the genre, but still good. And now they've outdone themselves with 'Predestination'.It's based on a Robert Heinlein short story (with a few extra bits added in).The real strength of the film is not the plot - it's the characters, acting and writing. The story that the main character tells is compelling, and at first seems completely out of place. I was thinking ""Wait a minute, where's the time travel?"" However, the slow pace and great acting/dialogue just draws you in.The time travel story loops around, and some viewers might see some things coming. The plot does require a certain suspension of disbelief, but it's so inventive and creative that it's easy to follow down the various rabbit holes.In contrast to other Australian films, it's nice to see one that is actually good with a wide commercial appeal. It's been a long while. The film doesn't feel overly 'Australian' though in comparison to some other recent productions.",Predestination
137,voyou-703-655350,Time travail,6,26 November 2014,"Predestination is beautifully filmed and acted, and that would almost make it a good movie. Almost. Truly, I found it compelling from the very first pictures, and I enjoyed the eye-and-ear-candy until the end.Despite its extreme predictability. For a number of reasons, every trick, every bit of smoke and mirror is instantly and completely see-through, and the entire jigsaw is understood before the half-mark. All that's left is to see how it will develop in the details. I could do with predictable, but what really reduces the value of Predestination is that the story keeps kicking itself in the gonads.That's the kind of stories we write when we are 12, and that we trash right away because they never work. Not without too many convenient extraordinary occurrences. Not without being contrived to the point of ridicule. And above all not with the human factor. Respect of chronology is not enough. Characters' actions need to make sense. Here they never do, neither the agent's, nor the Bureau's.I still recommend to watch it once for its qualities and despite its idiocy. It may even make you dizzy if you're not used to time travel.",Predestination

139,jonnithomas,This is a thought provoking drama dealing in temporal paradox,9,23 April 2015,I thoroughly recommend this film to anyone that enjoys a classic thought provoking drama with a basis in science fiction. Is that you ? Well how do you know ? What made you decide ? If you don't watch it what will you do instead ? If you do what won't you have done in the time that you sat and watched it ? The film is well written and directed and makes you think of time and how we perceive it. Would you kill Hitler as an baby of three months old ? The baby is innocent of any crime against humanity but will become a monster as an adult. If you knew this fact and could kill an innocent baby and change history would you ? So the film says nothing about Hitler but looks at the process of action and reaction and cause and effect in a time traveling setting.The acting is solid and really makes you like the characters without understanding at first what is happening and who they really are and their role in the drama.The directing is competent and the actors are well cast.

142,LilyDaleLady,Dreary adaptation of classic Heinlein story...,3,5 September 2016,"I give this a 3 out of 10 almost solely for the wonderful performance of Australian actress Sarah Snook as the protagonist. She can't save this mess -- nobody could -- but this is a career-making performance and she gives the film an emotional depth and resonance that otherwise it would utterly lack. I look forward to seeing more of her work in the future!So OK: lot of folks here do not recognize this as an adaptation of a very old Robert A. Heinlein short story from 1958. Legend says he wrote it in one day. Heinlein is one of the classic masters of Sci Fi, author of ""Stranger in a Strange Land"" and ""Starship Troopers"" among many others.Actually, since they gave it the name ""Predestination"" (?) and not the original story title of ""All You Zombies"", it took me a good 45 minutes to figure this out. I hadn't read that story in years. It's very short -- a few pages -- and unlike the film which is very dark and dour, the STORY is humorous and breezy. It is clearly done as a lark, a kind of meta-joke. At the time Heinlein wrote it, for one thing, people knew virtually nothing about DNA. Also Christine Jorgenson was in the news, making people aware for the first time of transsexuals and sex reassignment surgery -- very shocking in that era.On top of that...Heinlein wrote this around the time of the old humor song ""I'm My Own Grandpa"" (sung briefly in the film). Twirl all that around in a blender, and you get ""All You Zombies"". Also add some serious lack of knowledge about genetics, DNA, inter-sex and hermaphrodism. But again, it was a HUMOR story....meant entirely to be a brain twister. If you put yourself in a 1950s frame of mind, and not a 21st century frame of mind, you can see the humor. Heinlein wanted to come up with a story about someone who changed genders from female to male, AND had a baby. He wondered if you could do that, could you -- theoretically, with time travel (!) -- be your own parents?Well, aside from the lack of time travel....this is stupid. You can't change genders that easily. A woman (even a hermaphrodite appearing as a woman) would not suddenly lose her womanhood because she had a difficult delivery, even if she had a total hysterectomy. (Do women TODAY who have hysterectomies become surgical males???) Even in the 1950s, it was hardly the norm to do forced surgery without consent, on an otherwise sane ADULT. (Here, Heinlein may have read about a few rare cases back then, where a MALE child had a traumatic accident to his penis, and so surgeons - with consent of the parents -- tried to turn such a victim into a female. These attempts utterly failed, BTW.)On top of that...Heinlein knew astonishingly little about genetics. A child of two twin siblings (say, fraternal twins) would likely have horrible birth defects, from multiple copies of genes. It would be a perfectly terrible idea, not some brilliant way to create a ""time travel agent"".Mostly though, it is a short breezy story full of bad sexist jokes (the worst is that the heroine wants to go into space, and so joins an organization of female prostitutes who service astronauts (!!!) called W.H.O.R.E.S. Yes, Heinlein was really THAT sexist and misogynistic (but then, it WAS the 50s).Spinning this out into a full length film and making it glum & serious just ruins whatever charm the original short story had. I think it could have been a terrific episode of the original Twilight Zone, had they been able back then to deal with issues about gender, sexual identity and unwed motherhood. But at this length, and with this overly solemn attitude, it feels too much like it was plucked from sci fi historical obscurity SOLELY because it is about ""gender identity"" and transsexual surgery. As such, they can't participate in Heinlein's JOKE over this, but have to be politically correct. It sinks this slight story like a massive two-ton boulder strapped to a piece of tissue paper.Among the epic failures....Ethan Hawke is badly miscast, since he looks NOTHING like Sarah Snook, and unless sex reassignment surgery makes you TALLER and muscular, no excuse about a ""face transplant"" will explain the differences. In male makeup, Snook looks a bit like a younger Mickey Rourke, and I can only imagine how good he would have been in this (25 years ago, before he ruined his face boxing). Surely they could have found someone who was slightly built, and had more of a resemblance to the actress though.Unfortunately this reveals the problem in translating this to the screen: in a STORY, we see the characters only in our imagination. In a FILM, if you see right off that the time travel agent and Snook look nearly identical, you would be in on the twist right away (yes, even with a ""face transplant""). In any event, the whole thing doesn't work at all, and is doomed by its 1950s ideas about sex reassignment surgery and even gender identity. No surprise this went direct to video. Watch it only to see Sarah Snook; she is worth sitting through the lameness. I predict she will be a major actress in short time.",Predestination

👨‍⚖️ Review :
Predestination is sci fiction marvel which encapsulates time travel, journey of love, fates in ones lives with brilliance. The theme of the movie is a paradox of events like which came first the egg or the chicken. Directors Michael and Peter Spierig make you stick to your seats till the end ,while simultaneously getting thick inside the plot and leave you stunned and mind blown in the end.Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook are outstanding. Brilliant screenplay and direction makes it a treat to the eyes.The experience of watching a great movie should not begin and end within the cinema house itself. It should spark debates, excited discussions, urge countless recommendations and leave you thinking about it for a long time afterwards. This film accomplishes all of these things and in abundance.

146,vandelour,They got the title wrong,3,29 November 2014,"Predestination. Nice title. A whiff of science fiction, a touch of ooh what is that. Only one problem, they got the title all wrong. It should be 'Predictable' or 'Pretentious'. My vote would be for predictable. Literally from the the very first scene before the credits roll I got the movie or at least 95% of it. The parts I didn't get didn't matter as the slog to get TO those parts were so uneventful and devoid of suspense or intrigue I almost had to resort to exercise to stay awake. I'm starting to feel like science fiction fans are thought of as easy marks, suckers for anything Hollywood churns out and labels as SF. Toss in a space ship or time travel or hell anything in the future and we're supposed to fall in line at the theaters like lemmings. Sorry, but transparent junk like this movie are not for suckers or true believers, they're for morons who don't pay attention. If you still want to see it, don't open your eyes until the credits start to roll past otherwise you'll suffer as I did.",Predestination

It thinks it's smart, fresh, not seen before, new.It's NOT !The movie is slow, dull, and brining.Most of the movie takes place in one set even.Neither the actor using or efforts are anything to write home about. Worse yet the story is SO bad!I'd rather watch a D rated SyFy channel original movie.",Predestination
148,toddg-473-289818,starts slow but gets interesting,7,19 November 2017,"As soon as the opening credits for this movie rolled, I noticed that it had its roots in Australia. I reminded myself to be patient with the plot unfolding, as Aussie movies tend to be deliberate in how they spell out their tales. They are definitely not the instant gratification type movies that are made in North America.Having said, that, it takes over half of the movie for Ethan Hawke's bartender character to hear the story of the mysterious androgynous patron. We then learn that Hawke's character is not there by coincidence, but instead to give the patron, better known as the Unmarried Mother, a chance to go back in time and alter the course of his/her life.The story then takes off, with time travel and characters not being what they seem at first glance becoming the norm. There are definitely hints of INCEPTION and LOOPER that follow, but in a more subtle way. Worth watching to the end.",Predestination
149,ups-36964,Get ready for Brain yoga,8,23 January 2020,"Few movies succeed to mess witn your mind, and very few are enjoyed by us while they do so. Predestination (2014), is one of them.A sci fi thriller, directed by the Spierig brothers, is although based on time travel, comes with a twist, Predestination Paradox. Acc to it we can't change our past no matter how hard we try. We can either end up getting witness it or be a part of it. The story is interesting though. Especially, the twist at the end will blow your mind. Ethan hawke has done a great job, but Sarah Snook is the one who steals the show. Her acting as a homosexual woman and her transition into a man is just brilliant. The cinematography and screenplay are excellent too.Now, talking of the flaws, the length of the film is short. Some other interesting elements could be added. The barkeep's hunt for himself could be extended by creating suspense. Also, few more characters could be added for humor.",Predestination
150,MovieSonic,Good but didn't meet my expectations,7,28 November 2014,"I was expecting a lot more from this.I don't mind that almost the entire film is a character-driven film as opposed to being 'this year's Looper' (it's not). As soon as I realised, I adjusted my expectations and just enjoyed what I was watching. I like films that have interesting stories and that rely upon the acting and script so I'm fine with that and it's well worth watching for that reason.What I didn't like was something I now call the 'Shyamalan effect'. Where you're expecting a certain ending or advertised/implied plot point to actually materialise and then it doesn't. It's really bloody annoying! I didn't feel like the film ultimately had anything to say or anything to overcome (once it ended) and I can't say why without spoiling the film.I predicted almost every major plot point as it unfolded and I feel that the lack of thought that went into developing an actual bad guy so to speak, really let the film down.It's still a good film and everyone involved should be proud but maybe next time, deliver what you promise.7/10",Predestination

Is Australian cinema half a century behind the curve?
I thought the reminiscences in the first half of the film were interesting because the reminiscences in the first half of the film created a unique atmosphere. Usually, screenwriters are careful not to include reminiscence in reminiscences. So when I saw it in this film, I thought, ""Oh? "" And Later I was like, ""Oh, so that's what happened,"" Then, for me, well, story wasn't that surprising .
Even so, the reason this film is not a bad film is because of the sharpness of the script. The fact that no extra characters are included in the story is good. Also, there is no inflated episode at all. Everything is neatly fitted in like a well-done short story, and it's easy to watch with a sense of speed.

Plausibility: this is not the aim of the movie so it should not be too much of a concern. The whole idea of time travel is implausible at the moment. However, in terms of plausibility of action and reactions to those actions, the movie does quite well. People can do whatever it takes to give themselves a purpose. Again, it all comes down to emotions. Storytelling: very good storytelling method. Moves very fast and reveals the events in a very interesting way that keeps you wondering and wanting to know more. Character development: There is one main character that comes during different stages of his/ her life. You understand the reasons behind all her/his actions and that makes the character deep and understood. Casting: Great leads and great acting. Very fit for the role.

Yes.. positively ""artsy"", but an artsy movie does NOT make a good movie. It's what annoys me about artsy movies that some people think artsy means good and leaves a high review. It, in my opinion, is NOT good and not worth even a 5.0 rating!
Felt like watching paint dry.. and at the beginning of this movie the whole thing became pretty predictable. Nothing about it in the last 30 minutes left us with a ""who'd have thought?""

That Villain is called the Fizzle Bomber.Time travel movies are tough. Tough to figure out. Logic is thrown out the window. It's like a dream where everything is possible, especially the impossible, and nothing can be explained to anyone's satisfaction. If you try to figure out Time Travel stories doctors will be called in, the family will go into Intervention mode, friends will stay away, and your dog won't know you anymore. The story starts with ""a man walks into a bar, and tells a story."" In order for you to figure things out you must pay close attention to the story, the song playing on the juke box and later on there are visual clues to help you. These visual clues will determine if you are on the right track. The ""story"" will take some time and seem like this is a play that is very talky, (all plays are talky, talky, talky) but later on you will draw on that story to piece things together. Hey, you can do this. This review is hard to do without giving too much away, but here is what I came away with. The Bar Keep doesn't want this to be his last mission and engages in various scenarios to insure that. The movie would be more readily understandable if the title was ""Realities."" See? Did I give away too much? HmmmOne thing I learned from this movie: if Time Travel becomes a reality we must take a deep breath before the Jump. Ha!The acting all around is excellent.

157,andrewburgereviews,A perfect circle,8,20 May 2019,"Directed by The Spierig Brothers (Michael and Peter), ""Predestination"" really is the type of film that would require two people to maneuver it. This is due to its linear yet complex script which's paradox makes it extremely unstable, barely sustainable from a narrative point of view. So, after letting the wounds from my brain heal for a few days, I finally decided to write this review.I will keep this spoiler free, which means a few things that I would have liked to say I will not. ""Predestination"" is not your average plot twist film. It does not have one big plot twist close to its end a-la-Shyamalan and, also unlike Shyamalan's films, its quality does not stand only in its plot. It is also from its stellar performances by one of the most consistently good actors in the business, Ethan Hawke playing a bartender (more or less) and the one who truly steals the show, Sarah Snook, portraying a complicated character--this is all I will say for the sake of not spoiling anything. This is the performance of her career, a multi-dimensional, daring portrayal of a tortured soul.So what is the deal with the plot? In short, the plot revolves around a temporal agent going through time to prevent crimes before they happen--yup, time travel. The key here is that the plot can be defined as a perfect circle, ingeniously crafted so that it has no entry point. Chronologically speaking, is like the ""snake that eats its own tail"". From the twist perspective, it slowly unwraps itself, clearing more and more until the final picture, predictably but satisfyingly, completes itself.Apologize for the ambiguity, but know that this is a film which is built on keeping the viewer engaged, and while it had moments when the narrative struggled to keep the logic, it succeeds in the end by staying on the edge of the aforementioned circle. Compared to Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"", another mind-bending work, this film relies on everything going according to plan. Happily, the plan is one hell of a twister in its own right.If you are an attentive viewer, then ""Predestination"" will leave you stupefied and fascinated, and you will feel the need to turn it around in your head over and over again trying to find a gap in its continuity, but trust me, you won't. And to think it started with a pure, newborn baby girl and ended with a psychotic old man.",Predestination
158,freydis-e,"Yes, watch this. But watch the film before reading these spoilers .",6,4 February 2019,"This review has BIG spoilers. If you have an interest in this movie, I'd advise you to go ahead and watch it first because a lot of the fun here comes with the surprises. Maybe read this afterwards and see if you agree with me?Not quite as good as its high IMDB score, it's not far off though. The actors do fine, especially Snook in a very odd part, and everything else is good except for the three major flaws listed below.One: It's based on a short story written in 1958 by Robert Heinlein (classic SF writer for any who don't know). All the time-periods in the movie (except for 1945) were Heinlein's visions of his future, but all of them are in our past. Therefore we know that the future he envisioned (e.g. female-only sex workers in space to service all-male astronauts - and a whole lot of other chauvinist stuff which Heinlein was generally known for) didn't happen. The film-makers have chosen to follow these aspects of the story closely, thereby transforming what Heinlein intended as reasonably realistic SF into what for us is an unreal, sometimes absurd, alternate-reality fantasy. Paradoxically, following the story closely has produced an effect its original author did not intend, and it wouldn't have been hard to make the story work with secret time-agents operating through the real past we know. Or indeed to shift it into our future.Two: The previous objection was to following aspects of the original too closely. Paradoxically again, this one is about NOT following it. Like so many movies based on books or stories, this isn't as good as the original. This is chiefly because it loses focus by adding the yawn-worthy bomber sub-plot, which: is banal and ordinary compared with what is going on elsewhere; has little to do with the original story; was presumably included to introduce fights and violence and make the movie more 'exciting'; and makes no sense. This is particularly sad because the original extraordinary story always made perfect sense. It would have been far better to follow it and concentrate more carefully on what the story was about.Three: One of the major revelations is that Hawke and Snook are playing the same character. There's a lot of explanation to try and make this believable - the face was burned and had to be reconstructed, the vocal cords were damaged, changing the voice, etc. However film-makers ignore the fact that Hawke is six inches taller than Snook. The height difference is obvious throughout and actually referred to in the script at one point, making the whole notion ridiculous, so it just feels like a cheat when it's revealed. Yes, these actors are good in their parts, but it can't have been beyond the casting department's capabilities to find two people of roughly the same size when it's so central to the plot. This makes as much sense as casting Steve Buscemi as Muhammad Ali. He'd have done a better acting job than Will Smith because he's a better actor, but it just wouldn't be believable on physical grounds.This review concentrates on the negatives. To re-iterate, this is a good and entertaining movie based on an interesting 50s SF premise and well worth a watch, even if you do know what's going to happen (or in this case maybe it happened already!)",Predestination

When the movie was over i was...dumbfounded. No no. I felt dumb.

Sci fi?
Fantasy?
The plot was okay when Jane was telling her side of the story, it got me really interested, then. When it came to the time machine part, they lost me there.

160,flowirin,a nice wee movie,7,29 November 2014,"from the get go, this movies is obvious and unsurprising, by scene 3 all the elements are played and the conclusion is inevitable. (although my partner who is not such a scifi buff didn't understand what was going on at all and got hung up on how he could be his own mother). Despite the obviousness, the story itself rolls along nicely, drawing out the confirmation of the twisty plot in an engaging manner. There were moments when the sheer emptiness of the world was a little draining - with only one person making up nearly all of the story, and barely 2 or 3 minutes of screen time with other people involved. The end encounter with the aged self was also played too straight for true entertainment - the director could at least have highlighted the opportunity for suicide to derail the merry-go- round, but hey. overall, a nice light movie with a little bit of mystery kept back. the acting is OK, although suspension of belief is required if you are supposed to not notice the guy was not a woman in drag.",Predestination

In fact, only his minor works have ever been done, and until now, the film translations of these minor works have failed or at least disappointed (Puppet Masters; Starship Troopers; 2-3 low budget 50s movies). Well, the short story that Predestination is based on is still a minor work, but the realization on film is jawdropping. From my perspective, a 100% success. And who is/are the main character(s)?

Yup you've guessed it!So basically at any point in the film they could have resolved the main plot at any point and resolved the needless deaths of innocents & the troublesome life that awaited them (over & over) if they just stopped rather than prattling on about the idea's of the 'chicken & egg' or the Ouroboros (snake eating its tail)The only Ouroboros this film delivers is one's head being stuck up its own backside.,Predestination
173,jadediamond,A Strange Paradox,6,4 July 2020,"Checked this movie out because the premise looked interesting for an Ethan Hawke movie. This is a crazy time travel movie about a continuous paradox of a man/woman time traveler falling in love with different versions of him/herself throughout his/herself, going back in time to procreate a baby version of themselves with their male and female self, then kidnapping the baby version of themselves and then traveling back twenty years in the past to drop the baby off at an ophranage so they can grow up to as the female version of themselves to mate with the male version of themselves to create a baby version of themselves which the future version of themselves will kidnap and then go back in time to drop the baby version of themselves at the orphanage to start the cycle again. The final predestination is the protagonist meeting with the future antagnoist version of himself. Instead of accepting the dark part of himself, he kills the dark part of himself and begins the neverending cycle once again.Interesting concept which is way easier to follow along than Cloud Atlas. This movie explores The Great Paradox. As humans, do we have free will or are our lives, paths, choices predestined?",Predestination

175,jordanthomas_2009-346-914758,One of the best time travel films you'll see,10,27 June 2018,"Based on the short 1959 novel, Predestination stars Ethan Hawke as an agent working for a secret organisation that prevents crimes from happening. Disguised as a 70's barman, he looks for information regarding a very dangerous bomber nicknamed ""The Fizzle Bomber"". He meets an isolated person who feels disconnected from society and straight away you think this person is the suspect. It takes a completely different direction by focusing on a solid story rather than the action routine that we are so used to seeing in time travel films. The majority of it is told in flashbacks via conversation between these two characters. The time periods have a very authentic feel to them jumping back and forth from the 1940s, 60s, 70s and 80s. It gets off to a slow start but it becomes a highly engrossing film where we feel a solid connection to these characters. It will keep you thinking all the time with its constant twists and turns. Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook are so convincing they give the film a lot of edge and intrigue. These two actors really play off of each other and the chemistry is flawless. However there are a few unusual choices some characters make, but the writers do their best to explain a lot of these things which I won't spoil here. It's about time travel so there is bound to be plot holes and a lot of confusion but through great editing and the occasional exposition dialogue, they manage to pull it off. It's a great technical achievement from the makeup, costume design, set design, editing and sound effects. With fully fleshed out characters, great acting from everyone and the sometimes witty dialogue, Predestination is a well made film worthy of a sequel.",Predestination
176,haosstoposto,Bizarre. In some ways.,5,12 December 2014,"So, we have another time-travel movie. Made after a short story by Robert Heinlein. I can't say this movie is bad, it has something unique, although a little bit perverse. The idea to be your own mother and father looks like some crazy-racial-supremacists wet dream. Eine Mama, ein Papa, ein Volk:). However, the movie avoids to entangle itself into time travel paradoxes. As it seems, everything is in accordance with the idea of time travel and the it's paradoxes, take for example grandfather paradox"". The downside of the movie is it's lack of suspense and the not-so-surprising twists. I read many time-travel stories, and must say that there was not a single thing in the movie that I didn't see coming. The only thing that is bizarre is the fact that John doesn't remember his face when he was a lover of his younger female self. But we cannot expect 100% logic in todays sci-fi cinema.

178,CharlieGreenCG,Impressive!,10,6 January 2015,"Now, surely you are all familiar with the story of the man who walked into the bar, right? If not, the answer is often corny. Predestination is very different. Instead, a man walks into a bar to tell barman Ethan Hawke an incredible story of his life - 'When I was a little girl ' he begins.Following is a paradox of awe and wonder as the longitude of narrative unwinds, winds, twists and does backflips in explaining itself non-linear - you may half expect it to be the brain-child of Christopher Nolan.Soon, it becomes apparent that Ethan Hawke barman, is a time- travelling agent who is on his final mission to kill the 'fizzle bomber', a terrorists that exploded a bomb in 1975 and killed 11,000 New York citizens. The bartenders had a chance to stop him once, but failed. Now jumping through the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's he must complete his objective.Granted, it a complex story that does pleasure us with answers, just a slowly increasing pile of question. Yet, masterful and with an ultimatum of science-fiction behind it. As far as time-travel films go, this is not too formulaic, instead thought-provoking to the point your head hurts.Directed by Michael and Peter Spierig (the Spierig brothers), the film advances from not having many cast; mainly just Ethan Hawke, Sarah Snook and Noah Taylor. Hawke, in now his second Spierig film (Previously on Daybreakers) is exceptional as he continues to show raw talent in pretty cool' indie films.Sarah Snook, who also has a majority of screen time, also shines. As an Australian newcomer, Snook and Hawke, with their directing counterparts (also Australian) have crafted a surprisingly original, gritty, genre-bending film – all in a spectacular 1 hour 37 minutes running-time.

179,joris-nightwalker,Love this,8,22 December 2014,"Movies that depend on plot twists are always valued better after a second viewing. Is it only the twist that numbs your judgement or has it more to offer than only an interesting narrative? In the case of Predestination I'd definitely answer with the latter. Even more so, after a second viewing it got better! Once you know what is about to happen you don't have to worry anymore about so-called predictability and the tiresome competition to guess how the movie is going to end before the actual end. This annoying trend never appealed to me and I like to be flabbergasted without dozens of suggestions about what might happen. I don't measure these kind of movies on my own capacity of how super awesome I am when guessing the end before everybody else does, proclaiming afterwards that it was just all too predictable. When valuing Predestination I like to take into account the provocative way it incorporates a brilliant gender-bending experience (thanks to the amazing Sarah Snook) and how the metaphysical inclinations of the story open the way to more philosophical questions about determinism and free choice. The movie never is the end of the thought process of the viewer. It doesn't stand or fall with its possibly (un)predictable plot. Predestination might appeal to fans of Looper, Minority Report, The Adjustment Bureau and the Wachowski's. Those who deem themselves of superior intellect, refrain yourselves from watching this. The world doesn't need more conceited losers.",Predestination

182,Pulpthatsfiction,Sarah Snook Shines in this Intelligently Crafted Film,8,9 March 2015,"Time traveling movies are a tough nut to crack. This film is based on the short story ""All You Zombies"" by Robert A. Heinlein, which for many years was thought to be unfilmable. What the Spierig Brothers, the writers and directors of the film, have done here is tell a story that's faithful to the source material and give their own changes to it that adds to the story rather then takes away.The film stars Ethan Hawke, Sarah Snook, and Noah Tyler who are all great in this film. What's really great about this film is that it's a sci-fi story about time traveling but the filmmakers and actors ground it by making it a character story and that's where Sarah Snook comes in. Sarah Snook plays a character that has had a really troubled life. I don't want to spoil anything but she shines in this movie and I think her performance that was really overlooked last year.The only big problem about this film is that when it hits the third act the film becomes really hard to follow. A lot of story lines come crashing together in great ways but it's just a lot to take in. I had do some research after watching, usually I hold it against the film but I won't for this one because even though I was lost I still very interested to what was going to happen.This is a wonderful Sci-Fi time traveler story that will keep you guessing all the way through. If you have a mind for this type of story then you'll have fun guessing what's going to happen next. Highly recommend this film is you are in the mood for a great time travel movie.3/4 Stars",Predestination
183,derbo73,Boring and flawed,2,19 May 2015,"First of all I must admit that it is entirely possible, that I just didn't understand, or ""get"" this movie. Not because it is overly complicated, but probably I totally ""missed it's point"" somehow.I do like movies that build up slowly, that leave you wondering for a long time and only begin to make sense towards the end. But, they still have to be interesting enough while doing so, to keep my attention, lest me entertained. This movie failed totally. The moment the bar scene sets in, the movie comes to a full halt for almost half of its running time. The story told isn't that bad at all, but it just is so misplaced and keeps you hanging after the start for so long, I was very close to quitting it.The whole story of Jane is so absolutely exaggerated and artificial, it simply doesn't work. For long periods I wondered what I was watching here - an orphans drama? A trans sexuality story? It explains why the protagonist has no family bindings, and is perfect for his job, OK. But where typical Hollywood movies simply skip story build up, this one goes way too far. After the the third time you here that Jane, being the best and smartest, yet again was a total failure because some stupid little twist, you simply stop caring.At about half the movie I guessed that she was all persons including the baby. And this was even more stupid, because the movie not only ignores known causality issues with time travel, it makes them worse by making it all happen to one person. After the end is being ""revealed"" it is no surprise at all and I was happy this movie finally ended.Smaller issues are: how is Jane saving mankind by subduing a bomber that had killed about 11.000 ""only""? (Maybe here I missed some detail, as my attention wained). Why didn't he kill the bomber right at the bomb, while he was showing his back to him? He had his gun pointed at him already, but he waited until he could turn around an fight back. Bullshit. And please, why ""Fizzle Bomber"" - what a shitty name, it doesn't sound like someone causing terror, it sounds like a lemonade marketing name.So basically, the story all in all was lame and it was told badly. I can't understand why this movie was produced on that budget at all. Only special effects was a gust of wind caused by the violin case time machine (stupid, how should a temporal distortion cause such a material effect) and the overdone 60s interior design of Space Corp.All time travel movies suffer from causality paradox problems, but this one takes it self very seriously and ruins itself by it.I dunno, I just couldn't enjoy this mess.",Predestination

190,the_bluesman,"What comes first, the chicken or the egg? – The rooster!",10,28 April 2016,"'Predestination' had been sitting on my watchlist for quite some time before I finally decided to watch it the other day. I don't really know why I waited so long to watch it. Reading the very vague description of the film's storyline about a time-traveling agent who pursues a criminal that managed to get away throughout time probably has something to do with it. Nevertheless, I had read mostly good things about 'Predestination' beforehand and Ethan Hawke is a great actor, so I had somewhat raised expectations for this film.How shall I put it? The film completely met my expectations and exceeded them hands down. 'Predestination' is a masterfully directed film that is so much more than the time-traveling agent storyline. From the description and the film's poster I expected a sci-fi action thriller, which 'Predestination' is to some extent, but it is also something quite different. In fact—even though it starts with action-filled scenes and sci-fi/mystery elements—a big part of the film is more of a drama that takes place in a bar, where Sarah Snook's character tells the barkeeper a pretty unbelievable story. Gradually we learn more and more about the character of The Unmarried Mother and how the character's life proceeded, which is done through masterfully edited flashback sequences that partially feature voice-overs. The cinematography and production design of this film is stunning. I literally couldn't take my eyes off the screen while this fantastic story unfolded.More importantly, the acting is excellent throughout. A real surprise to me was Sarah Snook, who played her remarkable character so believably and with great depth. I didn't have her on my radar until now because I only knew her from her relatively small part in 'Steve Jobs' before seeing 'Predestination,' but now I am already a fan. She did an absolutely amazing job here. Her phenomenal performance in 'Predestination' is Oscar-worthy if you ask me. Just wow! Ethan Hawke is also great in his role, which is not surprising as he usually delivers memorable performances. Noah Taylor has the third big role in the film (Mr. Robertson) and he is perfectly cast as well.I don't want to say too much about the story of 'Predestination' to keep my review spoiler-free, just so much: It is an amazing story about time travel and the paradoxes that the alteration of past events creates with regard to the course of a person's life. This subject really fascinates me and I'm sure anyone who likes time travel stories that give food for thought will be mesmerized by 'Predestination.' I sure was. Just don't expect an action- or technology-filled sci-fi film. The human element occupies center stage here. Certain elements of the film reminded me of Stephen King's '11/22/63' and Jerome Bixby's 'The Man from Earth,' two other excellent science fiction stories. If you like those, you will love 'Predestination.' Still, this film is very unique and I can't really recall having seen anything similar in the past. The film's story is very fascinating and I know I will be thinking about it for a long time. I'll have to read Robert A. Heinlein's 1959 short story '—All You Zombies—', which 'Predestination' is based on.2009's 'Daybreakers' (also starring Ethan Hawke) was already a pretty good film, but 'Predestination' is the Spierig Brothers' masterpiece so far and already one of my favorites. This film has it all: A captivating story without any lengths, an exceptional cast, great visuals, superb editing and an engaging score. It couldn't be any better in my mind, which I only say rarely of a film. This one truly is a perfect 10!",Predestination
191,Snorreplop,"The Chicken, the egg or maybe the Komodo dragon?",8,28 November 2014,"Another time travel mystery to bend your head around. Ethan Hawke is the bartender, a legendary time travel agent correcting rights and wrongs in the past to make a better future. He is going on a final mission to prevent an attack from his nemesis, the fizzle bomber, who has always managed to elude him. As his mission sets off, the bartender encounters a regular John in a back alley bar. After hearing the John's moving life story, the bartender does a proposal that cannot be resisted.Linearly speaking the film is pretty straightforward. We follow the actions of the bartender through time. There is a unique gimmick embedded within the plot that makes this movie stand out somewhat in relation to other time travel peers. This alone makes it worth it to go see it.On the downside: some of the 'twists' are too transparent and can be seen coming from miles away. This does not do much damage to the entertainment value though. Hawke and Snook bring their A-game and seem to be enjoying themselves. The backdrop of the spacefaring sixties and seventies brings some extra color to the palette.All in all a intelligent and entertaining flick with some food for thought.",Predestination

Don't read any more, go watch this movie and have a good time. Ethan Hawke is solid as usual but Sarah Snook steals the show with her dualistic acting in a dynamic and complex role that would challenge any actor. The story is different and interesting first of all and the technical side of time travel is hardly discussed but the paradox is complex and well developed. But as with most paradox that involves time, the question about the chicken or the egg comes about, but later on this... so now for spoilers. If you don't care about spoilers and little more detail to the movie, read on...So there subtle hints throughout the film that drop a hint about the perpetual nature of the paradox that takes place in this film, the difference from other time travel paradox being that this is completely planned and man made where the story starts with a baby being dropped off at an orphanage and as the story unfolds it becomes apparent that this is an important part of the paradox... however how the baby is created in the movie is clear, but then the chicken and the egg question comes about... how did the original baby (the same at the beginning) that starts the paradox originally come about to start this whole thing? As usual, there needs to be a parallel universe for something like this paradox to be fully realized. But either way, a good movie from down under and I would recommend it! Surprisingly, there are no Aussie accents in the film.",Predestination
193,djg32514,Excellent and Well Thought Out Sci-Fi,9,19 October 2017,"I think Australia has supplanted the U.S. in the motion picture industry with actor talent and movie production. This is another example. Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook are exceptional in this film. The film itself is artfully directed, they story is intelligent and surprising. Dark at times yet wonderfully told story concerning temporal science. Yes, time travel but filled with twists and turns. Sarah Snook who I had no experience with was stunningly good in this role. Enough so that I checked for her other works. She is breathtakingly beautiful to say the least and extremely talented. In this film she plays several roles, both male and female. She does well in both.I don't get enthusiastic about much any more. A victim of my age and the society I find myself in here in the U.S. I strongly recommend this film to lovers of intelligent science fiction. No futuristic technology and weaponry but for the idea of time travel itself. A real gem in an industry that produces so few.",Predestination

195,tomosp1965,Find out just how 'Relative' time is.,8,5 May 2015,"I enjoyed this film, but was disappointed by the paradoxes that the film creates. If the 'Many worlds' theory is correct, then obviously a person can jump from one reality to another and interact, or change the path of theirs, or another persons life. But if there is only one world, or one reality, then to change any aspect of yours, or another persons life, would affect not just you, but the space/time continuum. That's where this film has a problem. It never states that there is any other reality other than the one that they are in.Don't get me wrong this is a great film and very watchable. Ethan Hawke is fantastic and portrays the lead with a gruff and puzzled brilliance. In fact there is no bad acting in this movie and the plot will keep you glued to your seat.8 out of 10",Predestination
196,Steve-Zoicks,Who are we and what is predetermined.,8,28 November 2018,Well I would have to say that for a 90 minute show the last 30 minutes was more powerful than the first hour. The show begins with an explosion leading to a timewarp of the future. Ethan Hawke plays a magnificent character however the first 60 minutes is literally and orientation that is both boring long and very disconnected. Until the end of the movie where the actual twist is experienced the huge dialogue of just the two main characters can become quite lethargic. I strongly recommend that you listen to every word that is said between the two main characters at the bar as it will give you an insight as to what actually will come at the end of the movie. While I appreciate the reasoning behind the very long two cast conversation The last 30 minutes does explain the whole story the quest being that everything is predetermined and that person we think we are is actually a person that we do not believe we are. I was going to give this movie a one out of 10 but the ending definitely makes this a movie to watch,Predestination

Ethan Hawke plays time traveling, Temporal Agent, who is permitted a 50 year parameter to travel around. His duties are to stop mass murders, terrorist bombings. For health reasons, agents can only jump in time so often. Hawke is near retirement and draws out a potential candidate. Only the candidate has a history of kinks and twists, and therein hangs the tale. Based on a story by Robert Heinlein. The script is flawless, the direction taut and lean. Not a single scene is wasted. Try to watch without reading too much about this one. Most reviews will be unable to resist spoilers.",Predestination
199,Marthian80,"Excellent time travel paradox story, that keeps you pondering",7,18 April 2017,"Predestination opens with a man trying to disarm a bomb, which fails because the bomber is still there and he disables him. He does however successfully contain the bomb explosion but his face gets burned off. Shortly after these events we learn that this man is an agent for a mysterious organization that solves crime by catching the criminals before the deeds are happening, using time travel. After his face got burned, he returned to his own time and is given a new face using plastic surgery. He is then given his last assignment for the organization: catch the infamous ""Fizzle Bomber"". For this he has to go to 1978 New York and work as a bartender, which goes well until a particular customer shows up who starts sharing his life story with the bartender. This extraordinary life story starts a chain of events that gets weirder and more complex the longer it goes on.I have seen several time travel movies at this point but this is the first one that blew my mind on several occasions. The paradox created in this one is very well done and leaves you pondering for several days. Off course I cannot say anything about it or the movie would be spoiled, so you have to see for yourself. The strongest part of the movie for me was the part where the barkeeper (Ethan Hawke) meets John who tells his life story. There was really strong chemistry between the two actors in this scene and they made good use of showing well detailed flashbacks. Some reviewers complained that the movie should have opened with this scene and I agree with them. It took a while for me to adjust from the world building / exciting opening scene to two people who share a story over some drinks. It all comes together in the third act of the film but I think the movie improved if they managed to do all the world building after the bar scene. But otherwise this movie looks and sounds great. The time travel special effects are done very well and look realistic to me. And unlike some other time travel paradox movies, this one is full closure: you should know and understand everything when the credits roll. So definitely check this out if you like time travel movies or just want to watch a movie and go ""WTF?"" a few times.",Predestination

Who the hell would think about that sick sci-fi movie. Im not complaining, but still, woah!Acting in this movie is great. Ethan Hawke gave us his best performance (he was better in Boyhood, but he is great here too). Sarah Snook did great as well. Dialogs are done great.Special effects are done well. I really like that time traveling parts. When he teleport, everything in room scattere. Special effects in this movie are not important like story, but I have to say that are done well.Soundtracks fits everywhere where they are. Somehow, they are connected with story.I think that part when the Unmarried Mother, as they are telling on IMDb, was telling a story about her horrible life was too long. They could shorten it a lot. I mean, she was telling him a story for about 20-25 minutes.At the end, I wouldn't recommend this movie to those who want only action movies where you don't need to think a lot, but I would recommend this movie to everyone else!And where are these mind-blowing parts, you will find out by your self!",Predestination

207,Simply-Red,Huh?,4,15 June 2016,"This movie is ""mind bending"" alright. I had to come back here to read the spoilers to fully understand itand now I realize it was a bizarre mental indulgence by the writer. You have to be a really boring person, able to focus on totally implausible plots and senseless production to really enjoy this flick. I have other stuff to focus on in my life, I need something ""closer to the surface"" in order to enjoy itI have actual work and complicated things in my real life to test my brain like that.There IS a saying in the movie that DOES in fact describe the basis of the movie, and it's not the question of ""What comes first, the chicken or the egg?""answer""The Rooster"". Noit's not that that obvious, the saying I am referring to is ""The snake that eats its own tail, forever and ever"". That's what this movie is. At least the movie tells you this at 1 hour and 25 minutes in to what is actually a very short moviethankfully.When ""the Rooster"" was mentioned, I was at least hoping the Alice N Chains song was going to be in the soundtrack.I'm not even sure this movie was supposed to presume fictional time travel. I think it was simply one person's mental state imagining all of it, and there are quotes and times in the movie that you are reminded that all of this time travel causes psychosis and dementiaand I think in the end, THAT was the premise of the movienot ""actual"" time travel at all. Just one wacko individual having personal ""mind flights"". Heymaybe I'm even more ""cranial"" than many reviewers on thisI haven't read one review that posed what I just did.We paid attention through the whole movie, but there really was not a lot of action.

209,cestleilacherradi,A bit disappointed,8,22 November 2014,"First of all, seeing the pretty Ethan so big on the cover of the movie, I thought I'd see him more and more. Second, I unfortunately didn't like the acting performance of Sarah Snook as a man in the bar. Funnily and weirdly enough, she reminded me of Leonardo Di Caprio when he was younger. I liked her though as a young female. Very nice smile! and very pure.I also found Ethan's acting to be weak. He seems sometimes to really just do it over the shoulder and that's too bad, since for me, he is a super great actor who should have won an Oscar for Training Day. But no, they gave it to Denzel who was not that unforgettable in that movie, contrarily to his performance in Malcolm X, for which he didn't win, at the benefit of Al, who really won't be remembered for the movie he won the Oscar for! Dude, do they drink or what? So, back to this movie, I had times when I was annoyed and so I began surfing the web! It is very rare I'd do that in the middle of a movie. To say, it has never happened I think. But really I was bored. The movie though began to be really entertaining for me when Sarah Snook realizes she's everyone she meets... So the scene with the baby becomes ecstatic! because now she knows who she is! The music of the movie is really great for me. Nice work.To finish, I'd say, if there's Ethan in the movie, I'd look anyway.",Predestination
210,mockfilmreviews,A fun head scratcher with plenty of twists.,8,24 January 2016,"Over the years, a love/hate relationship has developed with myself and time travel stories. I love the 'what if' aspects which drive the narrative, but the science drives the hate train for me where I cannot shut off the loophole detector in my O.C.D strangled brain. And no matter how sound the science, a loophole always slips in. Guaranteed. There's too many variables to be able to sit back, relax and let the plot unfold. Although, as of late, I have learned to just Zen out and not get too Spock about the logic involved. That said, I give to you the time travel mind-screw, Predestination (2014).Ethan Hawke plays a temporal agent (a time cop, no relation to Van Damm) who is on the trail of the Fizzle Bomber, a time traveling lunatic who is blowing up different cities throughout time. With this last assignment left, can the agent hope to stop the villain in time? Based on story by Robert A. Hienlien, that's what the trailer would have you think this film was about. You ain't heard the half of it. While my significant other and I sat down to watch Predestination, she turned to me around the fifteen minute mark and asked, ""Are you sure this is the right movie?"" I assured her that it was, although I did have similar doubts that my male pride kept on lock. Not to say that what we were viewing was not entertaining. Actually, we were drawn in by the characters and the story being told. But again, this was not what the trailer had implied. Now this is where being a reviewer gets tough. If I were to say anything else regarding the 'real' main plot of this film, it would be an automatic spoiler (spoilers? Not in my house).The performances are well done all around. As the film played through the changing time periods the film took on an interesting feel. Expositional scenes came across with the verbose wit of a 90's indie while the Sci-Fi aspects reflect an almost (not to be too meta) Gattaca (1997) style world, yet all built for for a modern day audience. The direction of The Spierig Brothers was engaging while never shoving the plot down your throat. Moderate, yet tense, pacing only helped move the plot while distracting from the clues.—",Predestination

The Spierig Brothers adapt a whole new world based out of Robert A. Heilein's short story, ALL YOU ZOMBIES .

You see, the movie is sort of a dark-drama where at times things can get a little... Thespian. // The CAMERA WORKmixed with the SET DESIGN really gave the impression that I was in another time period (60s and 70s); and it didn't seem like there was a lot of effects done, now that I think of it. // I would also like to bring up the MAKEUP: The job they did on the lead actress SARAH SNOOK was so amazing! They really captured many different shades of her. At one point, I really thought they were using a different actress.I give this film a 7 out 10 on IMDb.

212,BecauseIAmBATMAN,"Smart, slick and Entertaining",9,1 December 2014,Predestination is a pretty interesting Time Travel film. Its a pretty weird and imaginative story based on the short story All you Zombies by Heinlein. This film is overall is pretty fast paced and gripping. There is never a dull moment in the 97 minute run-time. The acting by Ethan Hawke was pretty solid. The cinematography is very well done. This film offers a pretty unique and creative perspective of Time Travel that has been explored with a different twist here. It explores a thought provoking and mind boggling aspect of Time Travel which I haven't seen before. Although it isn't something will be lost on you as the plot is relatively easy to understand. The less you know about it the better.Its overall A very well executed and satisfyingly dark Time Travel film. A must watch for fans of Science Fiction or Time Travel. Highly Recommended.9/10,Predestination
213,chacham,Stupid movie,4,17 July 2015,"Generally, a time paradox is about a paradox created by time, such as, a person goes back in time and kills himself. The paradox now being, that if he is dead, he could not have killed himself, but if he's alive, he would. How to deal with that has been the subject of many movies, many of which capture the imagination.Predestination, however, presents a paradox that has nothing to do with time. Instead, a preexisting impossibility is kept going because of time travel, like a plant being watered. There's also a lot of ""this is who you are"" and ""this is the way it has to be."" The story is slow moving, though slightly interesting, just to see where they can take it. They fail to deliver, but not miserably.

So THAT is NOT my problem with this film. Instead it's the ridiculous notion of the entire story and the actions that ALL of the different characters need to want to do in order to make the story even possible in the first place. It's very much a chicken or egg story and it's just plain silly. Truly ludicrous and unrealistic. A big disappointment. Although the acting was very good.",Predestination

216,ericzillazillo,Interesting little flick involving matters of time travel and fate,7,25 November 2014,"Let me start by saying that you sort of figure out the big ""reveal"" 2/3rds of the way in, even though the climax is way closer to the end of the film due to the film-makers giving out too much clues, so you spend the next 20 minutes waiting for the inevitable, and the moment that I think the film-makers intended to be the actual climax was just meh.It's a well made movie though with an interesting story that's not too hard to follow, built upon the premise of time travel. As a sci-fi nerd I didn't find anything about the concepts involved particularly remarkable, those familiar with time travel paradoxes etc will not be intrigued (but after all it is a movie adaptation of an old Heinlein novel so don't expect any revolutionary new concepts) While the twist was sort of predictable, an overview of the big picture still causes some amazement in its elegant construction, the kind of revelation you get when you first saw the twist to The Usual Suspects. However like The Usual Suspects, there are actually a few major things about the story that don't quite make sense when you actually think about it, so I would suggest not thinking about it - time travel films never make sense anyway because the concept itself is flawed.One of the great things about the film is its affirmation of determinism (which I suppose is reflected in the title), which reasonable people like myself will find pleasing to note. The film is bold in its approach and it doesn't shy away from sex and violence, plus it doesn't contain the typical family friendly Hollywood free will clichés, which is refreshing. There's also a darn weird aspect to the romance in the story that makes you go ""whaaaaaa"", you'll understand when you see it.The actors themselves are decent, definitely delivering a believable performance, the style of magic is clean and simplistic without any technobabble, and the movie is overall top notch. While I am kinda dismissive about the film because I hate time travel, it still deserves a solid 7 for its execution.People not too familiar with the Time Travel genre will definitely find the film intriguing and thoughtful, and while the final reveal was predictable, the various small twists scattered throughout the film were pleasantly surprising, and I would recommend this film to anyone who wants to see a good movie.",Predestination

On a minute-to-minute basis it is very entertaining and if my score were based on that alone this could be an 8, or even 9, out of 10. What holds it back, however, is the lack of satisfying resolution. Technically, that was the intention of the filmmakers, but it feels more like they wrote themselves into a dead end they didn't know how to resolve. Trying to describe what frustrates me about this film makes me think of a Michael Caine quote from 'The Prestige': ""Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called ""The Pledge"". The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. [...] The second act is called ""The Turn"". The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. [...] But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call ""The Prestige"".""Predestination does not have a Prestige, which is what holds it back from being a truly great trick.

First of all, while the title of the short story actually makes sense in a clever way, the title of the movie is plain and stupid, as it reveals the plot of the film, which is largely based on the predestination time travel paradox. The big twist of the ending is easily foreseen and is moronic and disturbing (I'm keeping myself from revealing it right now so that you don't have to watch the film at all). I'm rating this film with C- only because it's (too) ambitious and well directed, easily watchable and cause I like Ethan Hawke's tendency to participate in B movies.

While not as good as 'Inception', it still provides you with an intelligently-made, well-acted piece of high- concept sci-fi, regardless of some its narrative logic flaws.There's really very little I can reveal about the film without spoiling important plot details, other than it involves time travel and paradoxes. The first half of the film follows the life of an androgynous young man in a relatively straight forward fashion, whereas the remainder of the film launches into a complex, time-bending quest as the man is forced to alter events in the past. Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook are really the only two prominent players in the film, with Snook playing the man at two very different stages in his life, both who are starkly different individuals. She nails both of these roles effortlessly. Hawke is still good as the man's mentor, but the film really belongs to Snook. Though I was already familiar with the story's numerous plot twists and turns, the emotional impact is still quite strong. Having said that, there are certain hints and quotes placed in the film, some perhaps a bit too obvious, that can potentially give away these twists prior to when the directors intended. The concept itself is still well-executed and the narrative well-paced. Once again, I really can't be too specific without revealing too many important plot details. On the whole, if you like your science fiction films with an emphasis on plot and character development over high-end CGI and explosive action sequences, you will likely enjoy this one. Though they are numerous holes and lapses in logic in regards to the time-travel aspect of the film, these are relatively minuscule, and are redeemed by great performances and a well-polished direction. A big improvement over the Spierig brothers' last production 'Daybreakers'.",Predestination

229,realmuthaf,Where did all you zombies come from?,6,10 May 2015,"Putting things simple, this movie is an adaptation of Robert Heinlein's (pretty amazing) short story ""All you zombies"". I mean literally, the 1,5-hour long movie's plot dedicates around an hour to meticulous depiction of the events of the short story and then proceeds with around half an hour of original script with a VERY predictable plot twist. Now I have to admit, the scriptwriters did a fairly good job adapting a story that's only 10 or so pages long into a full length feature film, but the original story's impact solely depends on the final twist, and the movie merely copies it, so reading the original prior to watching the adaptation eliminates a great deal of positive impression. In other words: if you have not read ""All you zombies"", you will probably enjoy this movie and it will bend your mind quite a bit. The movie is well-filmed and even better-acted, with both Sarah Snook and Ethan Hawke performing their role(s) admirably. (Although you can save yourself an hour of time and possibly some money by reading the original story. It's really short, but is as impressive.) If you have, however, you will find almost nothing new here, and you might as well start watching this film from around an hour in. Since I did read the story, I give it only a 6. If I hadn't done this, my score would've been higher, probably 8.",Predestination
230,jonruff108,Woah...,9,19 January 2015,"I don't remember a time when a movie was able to ""blow my mind"" in the way Predestination has. In fact, I don't think I've ever been this dumbfounded from any narrative in any form of storytelling. The plot is so incredibly unconventional in almost every way and kept me riveted the entire time, my eyes were glued to the screen from start to finish.The acting is very good all around with Ethan Hawke delivering yet another great performance but the real star is Sarah Snook who gives such a varied and rounded performance it could've been Oscar worthy (oh well). The direction is extremely tight as is the screenplay. The score and cinematography shine as well and enhance every shot.I can't say enough about Predestination.

231,bdawe14,Mediocre with a bad plot,3,2 January 2015,"This could of been a nice fresh take on the time travel storyline but it is entirely predictable. The paradox is impossible and completely flawed you couldn't come into being spontaneously grow up go back in time change go back in time to meet yourself then become both of your parents. You would of had to of had parents in order to exist in the first place which makes it not a paradox at all but bad story telling lazy lazy lazy. Not only that but you're the hero and your future self was the villain that was the only remotely interesting part of the whole thing that was even remotely plausible in a completely fantasy time travel way. Nothing in this movie was remotely interesting.If you're and Ethan Hawke fan then go and watch day breakers or assault on precinct 13 or gattaca he's brilliant in all three, the latter two especially this however you could miss and you'd be all the happier for it.",Predestination

By adding this shitty inclusion the movie stops being sf and more LGBT propaganda. And feminist propaganda of course.The ideas that stem from the movie are the two lines that although false feminists keep repeating forever: that they do not need a man (so she impregnates herself so that she do not need a man anymore), and that they can do everything a man can (this kinda lengthy to explain but a large majority of women cannot do a lot of the things men can do; yes there are exceptions, but they represent less than 1%)There have been a lot of talk about the possibility of what happens in the movie. It is not possible and here are the scientific reasons:1.even impregnating herself it still does not guarantee the child is a clone of herself. Actually in the worse case scenario there are 3^22*2 possible versions of herself.That is 2.762.119.218 possibilities.2. even if she would be genetically same that does not guarantee she makes the same choices in each loop. Proof are identical twins.3.the genetic code is degrading itself. Cloning herself basically means that in each loop her DNA code will keep accumulating defective genes as a result of increasing entropy. In a few iterations she would become sterile.4. why does she do it? why does she impregnate herself? it is illogical.In a word is a feminist version of the terminator series.",Predestination
235,Callum_Hofler,A Competent But Highly Flawed Endeavour,6,1 December 2014,"""The past is obdurate."" -Stephen KingTime travel is a tricky thing to handle in film. We can often lose track of how characters are interacting and playing with time and events prior to where they started. It can often become messy, convoluted, or all of the above. Some of the most entertaining time travel films of the past few years have seemingly lacked proper logic and reasoning and have managed to find themselves lost in the confines of their own laws and rules about the practice; Edge of Tomorrow and Looper immediately springing to mind. Often, time travel films have to disregard spectacle or entertainment in favour of its principle stipulations; convoluted descriptions and loaded exposition on meaning, purpose, dilation and contraction, paradox, etc. It can be quite tiresome if not executed with a semblance of vehemence, which is what so many sci-fi films indulging in the idea of time travel disappointingly fall victim to.Predestination is a film which tries desperately hard to escape the confines of clichés, genericisms and predictability; it wants to surprise and enthrall you so desperately hard, that you almost want to pity the film for doing so. For the most part, it is possible to do as such; the final half of this film is highly engaging, full of some wonderful performances and paced with great energy. It also helps that the time travel component of this film, one which explores the meaning behind destiny and whether or not it exists, is executed very well and with logic at the forefront (or as much logic and reasoning as a time travel film is entitled to). Directors/screenwriters Peter and Michael Spierig work hard to add peril and unpredictability to the final half of the film, and for the most part, achieve such.And yet, it's immensely disappointing to see that the other half of the film is utterly painful to sit through. The film sets up a number of key plots and stories during its initial stages with expository dialogue from Sarah Snook, none of it particularly captivating. The film is stilted for a good portion of its running time, refusing to speed up and show instead of just telling, as it does so constantly. Flash backs litter the film, providing labored and boring back story to characters who aren't overtly interesting to begin with. One almost feels shame in feeling distaste for this picture though, as it so obviously has heart and passion behind it, waiting to get out. You can clearly see the admirable ambition that the Spierig brothers most obviously possess. They have a vivid imagination, and they're certainly having fun with building wild back stories for their characters. Unfortunately, it doesn't translate as fun for us, the viewer, as everything feels like narration. It isn't involving in the slightest; the viewer feels a spectator, unengaged in all of the 'action' occurring on screen. It's infuriating!Fortunately, the film manages to get itself back on track at the halfway mark, finally reaching the segment of the film which we've all been anxiously and desperately waiting to see; time travel. The film's exposition finally, at long last delivers what it has been building and hyping up for the past 45 minutes. The characters zip around all through time, exploring their lives (specifically Sarah Snook's character's life) and attempt to change their destinies; the key thematic concept behind the film. Is it possible to change the past? Are paradoxes not only feasible in the conceptual sense, but also feasible in the practical sense? Or will time always correct itself; are we on a set path all our lives? Perhaps time travel is part of the equation; maybe these characters were always meant to time travel? The film asks and answers these questions definitively by the end of its relatively short running time, and interestingly enough, these final 45 minutes manage to undo a good portion of the pain endured throughout the first half of the picture. The film frantically tries to recuperate a semblance of peril as it approaches its end, and I believe it accomplishes such properly. The conclusions and resolutions to each individual character are satisfying and foreshadowed properly, the film making the slow burn of exposition at the beginning somewhat worth it as the meaning behind individual events begin to waver into context. It's ultimately a very fulfilling film.Predestination asks and answers questions we've seen and heard before countless times. It doesn't do much that is overtly new. Its final twist will be spotted by numerous individuals, and some of the foreshadowing is sloppily done. Yet still, this is a competent piece of entertainment from two relatively under-appreciated filmmakers. It has decent performances from its two leads, and its pace, whilst uneven, eventually ignites to a blissful level. This film, ultimately, is worthy of a positive rating.One must be warned though; Predestination places its priorities on its time travel component, disregarding many of the necessities that should populate any good film. So, unfortunately, it still lacks a transcendent quality that I desire from a time travel film. Perhaps I shall encounter it one day; a film where good pacing, strong characters and an enthralling story are not sacrificed for intelligence and exposition to explain the laws and confines of the time travel element. Still, at the very least, it answered a few of my favourite questions about time itself.Can we change time, or are we given coordinates at the start of our life; is there another version of us in another parallel universe, thinking, talking, feeling, walking the exact same as us? Are we destined to repeat his mistakes and accomplishments? Can we pave our own path, or is time a singular road; a path which contains barriers to keep us from drifting outside of the regulated zones?Thank you Predestination, for the little but appreciated contribution you've given to my philosophy on time itself.",Predestination

237,willsgb,"a stylish, compelling, taut portrait of the nature of destiny",9,7 December 2017,"Time travel films are always going to be a tough watch, requiring meticulous crafting and supreme attention to detail from the producers and supreme concentration from the viewers. Those that play fast and loose swiftly lose credibility, and you don't get as much out of the film if you expect a ride you can switch off for. our reality, our very existence has, as far as we know, a very linear relationship with time, whatever it really is. we experience it and travel through it in a very specific and stable way, in one direction. Time travel is one of the ultimate realms of science fiction, because it is so far removed from this existence we dwell in. and yet, exploring it and playing with it, can inform us and help us learn about our own reality; it can help us understand the limits and parameters of this life we are born into.this film explores that in some detail, through the lens of time travel, which is a key aspect of the film but through which the real meat and potatoes of the film comes into sharp focus - a study of people, of what drives them, of the trials and tribulations they face, the way they interact with people, the way they change over time, the way experiences shape them, the way they influence those around them, the way they change the world, and the way the world changes them.the sound design is important, with dialogue clear, vital actions emphasised by excellent recordings and sound effects which carry weight, have a real punch and a kick, immersing you further; the score is excellent, full of drama and emotion but not domineering, merely reinforcing the events on screen; the dialogue is compellingly delivered by the excellent cast and the story is tightly woven and built with a slow but inexorable pace, adapted from a short story by Heinlein, perhaps best known for Starship Troopers, and beyond the macguffin of very real time travel, invented in our past no less, the mechanics of which is not explained or explored in any way, is believable and grounded, lacking the pyrotechnics some stories of this ilk resort to; the acting is impassioned and natural; finally, the cinematography, camera angles and editing is crisp and very deliberate, complementing the sound design, and the set design and props are also very deliberate and carefully prepared, arranged and lived in for the film. it all combines to produce a world you are looking in on, not a show set up for our entertainment, not an artificial environment but what feels like a real one.all of this is to create the revelation of the denouement and all that it implies and reveals, and it is worth it. Outstanding film, which I imagine will be further enlightening on subsequent viewings considering its nature.",Predestination

Nothing in that movie is outstanding but a good piece of high quality cinema.All together I have really enjoyed watching this flick. I just can not share the opinion that this movie is somehow brilliant or that is has a surprising end.For all who have not seen to much time travel movies (who has not since Dr. Who became very popular since 2005) this movie will be a wild ride full of unexpected happenings and a real brain teaser. For everyone else ... well soon after the start of the movie everything will happen mostly like you expect it.To be honest. The movie includes some really fresh ideas about time travel which where not shown in any other movies or described in books that I ever reed. That's what makes the movie still interesting. One thing is really greate for a modern movie production. The time travel machine is not explained in any way. Also the implications of time travel and paradoxes are not mentioned. This is very refreshing, because it regularly bores me to death when a movie waists the first quarter of it to explain how and why everything works.The movie could have been easily half an hour longer if they would had used the full potential of the story.All together it's a well crafted movie which is enjoy able for the most.

242,rpn313,May just be the best sci-fi / time travel movie of all time,10,14 September 2019,"I just watched this movie again for the third time tonight and it blew me away just as it did the first time I watched it. And although it's cliche to say, it's absolutely true with this film that everytime you see it you'll catch something new that was missed previously. The story is brilliant and the acting by Ethan Hawke, Sarah Snook, and Noah Taylor was just top notch - each of them deserved an Oscar nomination (and no that's not hyperbole).To all the negative reviewers, who either 1. Complain they don't understand the plot, 2. Thought the plot was ""ridiculous"", or 3. Claim the ""twist"" was too ""predictable"", let me tell you why you're all embarrassingly wrong.The ""twist"" is not that the Barkeep and Unmarried mother is the same person, that was pretty much revealed in the first 5 minutes of the film when you see the burnt face of Jane in the explosion being surgically repaired to become the healed face of the Bartender. If this was intended to be the ""twist"", the storytellers would not have Jane's face be so obviously shown in that opening scene. This is where most people are wrong. Furthermore there was plenty of dialogue through the movie that slowly but assuredly reveal and reaffirm this plot point. Also the fact that he/she is the fizzle bomber is not surprising, but it was not meant to be surprising. That wasn't the payoff.The ""twist"" was when Jane's surgeon explained to her after the Cesarean that she is a hermaphrodite (which is a REAL medical condition, so no the plot is not ridiculous). That was the climatic moment of the film, the ""OMG"" moment. It was a gut wrenching scene, one that Sarah Snook did an amazing job in, along with the subsequent scene when she was learning to change her voice and realized she could no longer call herself by her name Jane. What a performance. On first viewing of this film, no one, and I mean NO ONE, could've foresaw that coming. That is the twist, the ingredient, that sets this time travel movie apart from all others and actually makes it work. As Robertson explained to the Bartender, he is special, he is nature's anomaly that enables him uniquely suited for time travel. He has ""no ancestry"" or more precisely a circular ancestry. He is his/her own father/mother/child/grandparent. His whole life, every action taken, was predestined. In a sense his existence ensured there would be no time travel ""grandfather"" paradox. No Marty McFly changing his timeline here! And that is why he is so valued by Robertson and the Bureau.While that was the most important twist in the story, there are 3 others: 1. When we see Jane's lover is herself in 1963, 2. When the Bartender traveled back in time to kidnap the baby to complete the temporal loop, and 3. When the temporal field kit suffered a seemingly unfortunate error/ ""malfunction"" and couldn't decommission. For those who are paying close attention, this was not an accident. This was in fact Robertson sending the Bartender on a final (FINAL but illegal) mission which is why Robertson left him the note ""trace the timer"". One could even take it a step further and suggest that Robertson knew all along that John is the Fizzle bomber, but that his ""terrorist"" acts are just the lesser of two evils, consequences that actually prevented even bigger tragedies and overall saving more lives than taken.Again this a tremendous, all-time great sci-fi/time travel movie, that has you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. Screenplay, acting, directing, an amazing tour de force. Go see it again and again, I know I will.",Predestination

247,film316-125-427677,Ethan gives 12 Monkeys,10,14 March 2015,"Predestination is an indie film which had an EXCEPTIONALLY limited release in the UK for around a week. However at some point in time in that week, I found myself sitting in the cinema waiting for the movie to start, so I suppose the reel question is, will this new time thriller have me wanting to close my loop or go Back To The Future?Predestination is brought to us by the Spierig brother, who many might remember for the strange motion picture that was Daybreakers. Well this time they are back and toying with another stable genre in time travel, and honestly? There second outing is far superior to their first.Predestination is a movie that really tries to push your mind to the limit with what is acceptable in a film, it is frequently borderline flat out absurd however more often than not it's also gripping.Now I'll be the very first to admit that parts of Predestination don't make sense and it tries far too hard to have an insanely complicated twist, in fact there is a remark made in the film which completely undoes the entire thesis of the movie, but really if you want to enjoy a film (and you will want to enjoy Predestination) you can overlook almost any plot fault or issue that can be found.If you decide to forget the minor problems with Predestination you will find an exceptionally complicated story presented in one of the simplest ways, with the classical ""man walks into a bar"" set up. It's this sort of inter genre breeding that makes the Spierig brothers interesting to watch, they did it in Daybreakers and they do is in Predestination.Predestination is probably better thought of as a biography as the large percentage of the film is the back story of one of the two main characters. The film shifts and moves with the ever changing demands and pacing of the story without ceasing or faulting, it is fluent in its feel and style.What I like about the Spierig brothers is that they use what they have to their advantage. They (once again) have Ethan Hawke so they use him to his fullest, making him the on screen version of the audience, he's a sounding board to tell the main characters story too. The other counterpart in the film is Sarah Snook who, I've never seen before but puts on a really quite remarkable performance in Predestination. Making a brief appearance is Noah Taylor, but he is only in the film for a handful of scenes.I think that one of Predestination's greatest assets (and possibly biggest downfalls) is that it's so subtle with how the story arch's play out, they constantly seem inconsequential when really they have an massive impact on the world of the film.That or the entire movie is just a confusing, random mess that is so ridiculous and stupid it can't even make sense of its own plot threads.Predestination is a film whose ideas and story almost outreach it's own personal limitations, a movie that is so clever and intelligent that it's own subtlety could well be it's downfall. One that I'm sure most will miss, but any who have seen it won't forget.5/5",Predestination

Having also read Robert Heinlein's original short story ""'—All You Zombies—'"" I find that the screenplay has managed to elegantly elaborate the plot to make the film clearer and more profound.

249,William_Henry_Pratt,"A terrible adaptation of Heinleine's ""All You Zombies""",4,29 November 2014,"This picture is on par with the high school student versions uploaded to YouTube. In order to adapt Heinlein's ""All You Zombies' to the silver screen you have to take into consideration the criteria of a good motion picture. What a writer can successfully accomplish in prose will not translate visually very well unless it is altered for the film medium. The first excruciating fifty minutes of the film clumsily sets up the plot in the worst way possible. The liberties make the narrative lugubrious and boring. This story needs a very big event to support Heinlein's terrific story. The filmmakers shot the pages of the short story and in the process removed all the wonderful nuances that made Heinlein's original story so interesting. For example the original story illustrates how a person can appear to have ulterior motives when in reality they are helping that person. What the filmmakers wound up with is a collection of boring scenes of characters talking at each other with a bumbling narration thrown over it for 'good' measure. The last half of the picture is a convoluted mess that tries to out clever the original story's narrative, but just falls flat and is very unsatisfying. Heinlein's story is about self realization and transcending social prejudices. There's a good reason this picture didn't have a decent release. It is a dull, unimaginative, nihilistic mess that destroys the short story's original thematic elements.",Predestination

So I settled into it and slowly got myself ahead of the curve just before being told the next part. And while that was a cool twist, it was also a bit didactic. Literally beat the viewer over the head with the punchline. While I thought the film was pretty good, entertaining, etc. I think the writing and reveal was a little too thick. People are not that stupid that you have to spell out the joke. While this is far from a joke, more like a broken paradox but trust me that word too is mentioned several times along with the tag line, if you could kill the guy that ruined your life, would you? It's a good flick, one that you really don't have to pay close attention to because well, they literally explain it all to you over and over and just in case you didn't get the multiple heavy- handed attempts throughout the film, there is a recap montage summary at the end for the slower folks. Hence only 7 stars but personally I think Ethan Hawke has come a long way he's become quite the respected actor check out some of his other recent films he's started to get serious about his profession now that he's older. Good flick, well-worth a $1.60 Redbox rental.",Predestination

254,joeventuraa,Love Time Flicks...could have been better,7,4 January 2015,"I hate when others say this movie could have been better, but this really could have. First the obvious. Sarah Snook was the child of Leonardo DiCaprio and Jodie Foster in this movie. It's freaky really. She looks like Leo and sounds like Jodi with a cross in-between at every angle. If you already saw the movie, watch it again. You will be distracted.I love time travel movies. They do something to me I need to journal over. This movie could have spent more time on the travel and less setting up the plot. They took one third of the movie getting to the time travel scenes. This was a waste of cinematic space. The fight scene an hour into things took too much time. Stick to the core of the theme and eliminate useless energy like an extended fight.Ethan Hawke was excellent, but Snook played two roles simultaneously with ease. It is hard to believe she is playing two roles in the same scene. Again, the Jodie Foster distraction made it all the more believable this was indeed two separate actors. If Snook went for this, all the more brilliant. In fact, the storyline behind Snook's character was so strong it made the time travel purpose pale and this was a plot flaw. I didn't care so much about why they traveled back in time. I was hooked on Jane, the unmarried mother. Snook was that good!Very good film. Very well made.",Predestination

Fortunately I watched this on a long haul flight so I was able to scroll back & dissect it further. Don't read too many reviews. Don't watch the trailers. Just watch the movie. Let yourself be immersed in this and you will be rewarded with superb acting (especially from Sarah Snook) & thought provoking ideas that will haunt you for days. I was quite surprised to find it was an Australian made film however Dark City, another highly original sci-fi classic, was also Australian so there must be something in the water. Margaret Pomeranz awarded one of her Top 5 to See on the final episode of ""At The Movies"" to this underrated gem. It's definitely one of mine.",Predestination

258,rscafanever,"Thought-provoking, creative science-fiction",8,15 September 2016,"Predestination is a film that proves science-fiction can be entertaining without special effects. The number of main actors involved and the absence of modern CGI techniques made this movie a challenge to the film's crew and producers to achieve a thrilling experience. And they won the challenge.With a minimum of music and good acting, the story intrigues and unravels in a timely manner. A good portion of surprising plot twists make the story complete and interesting. Ethan Hawke gives a decent performance, but it's Sarah Snook that fascinates and brings the movie on a higher level.The film also raises some philosophical questions and can make you think. The main actor's dilemma's, the good dialogues and the consequences of the actor's choices add up to a movie to talk about after seeing it. If you need to see an interesting thriller, and you're not in need of too many special effects, this is a perfect movie.",Predestination

Some points:New John can't remember the face of his/her old and the only love. Doesn't his own new look trigger something in his mind?He goes back with Barkeep to the time when Jane met that mysterious man. And he f*** himself/herself. Who does that? Barkeep didn't tell John that he needs to sleep with his own past (Jane). John does that with no reason. The only thing he knows is that sleeping with Jane (himself) will make her/his life miserable. He didn't know about the loop that moment. He just fell in love with herself.The loop or the baby came out of nowhere. There is a conversation between John and Robertson when John is going to snatch the baby. Robertson tells him that he's more than an agent, a gift given to the world through a predestination paradox. And we're supposed to accept it. No sign of logic. Writers didn't try to make it believable.Some conversations was deliberately scripted unusual so that we can't find out who is who.

But it's an excellent movie if you love ""mindfuck movies"" with a twisted story, a story which makes you think but without ever being dull or boring.For those who said the story is ""stupid"", I think those people didn't get the point. If there was time-travel, those paradox situations like meeting yourself in the past and up-to and including giving birth to yourself etc. are what makes the idea of time travel so interesting and mind boggling. Maybe for some people a paradox is ""stupid"", but for me it's more fascinating than anything and the movie plays with those paradoxes and potential situations brilliantly.I loved it!

For me, it's the ending that really makes it worthwhile and I would even go so far to put it along the likes of Usual Suspects and Saw to have a brilliant climax - it took me a bit of time to figure out but when I did, I was blown away!Ethan Hawke is solid, as usual but it's really Sarah Snook who's brilliant in her role, which by no means was easy to pull off when you see her performance.Sometimes you watch films and can leave your brain at home.

That allowed me to concoct a very, very weak explanation, which I won't bore you with.Don't get me wrong this movie had some very good acting, production values and direction (despite the story line). It's in no way a total loss and some people love that bizarre twist at the end that many science fiction movies strive for such as Inception, the sixth sense, Loopers etc. However, I didn't enjoy this movie a half as much as those because those flicks made sense.

The following may contain minor spoilers - basically the very concept of finding an intelligent and physically fit woman to send into space as a prostitute because male astronauts are incapable of not having sex for so long is bizarre and kind of offensive to both women and men really in different ways, I mean it's just a horrible and unrealistic concept from a weird mind. So whilst she is training/being assessed to be a prostitute for astronauts there is heroic background music similar to the score from the recent Batman films, really it's not that heroic to be a prostitute or comparable to being batman, and her mentor is really impressed with her and finds her someone special, almost like a really cheezy children's film which has a hero doing predictably better than everyone else only she's a hero of being the best prostitute to send into space apparently. Likewise the story line was just so simple and unrealistic, as if written by a child.. for example the main character is ""different"", physically and mentally superior, and so of course always gets into fights which isn't her fault, even the selected smartest and fittest adults who are applying to be NASA prostitutes force her into a 1vs1 fight where of course she wins because she's so gifted physically as well as mentally...

That being said, i don't regret my decision in any way and i enjoyed the movie but i found it too confusing for the viewer as it gets more and more perplexed as the time passes and it's hard to comprehend what you see. First of all the movie has a mixed identity because the first half is completely different from the other. I found myself wondering if i remember correctly that this is a sci-fi movie about time travel because i was watching a long two sided scene that can only be described as a casual drama with the story narrated and then BAM! It transitioned in the most confusing time travel movie.So to put it in one sentence to show how extreme the plot is, it goes like this: Girl is born, she grows up to find out she has both gender organs, becomes a man(against her will on that note*), meets a man that it's her in the future, they(same person x2) travel back in time, the man version meets the woman version and they make a babe that -wait for it- it's again her! So okay, the twist is great and huge. But is it too huge maybe just for the sake of it? I won't even begin to try to explain the paradox in the plot and potential holes because it's already so difficult.*Strange time continuum things aside, i found it weird that they forced Jane to become a man, having surgery when she didn't even know about that. In many movies(and in real life) we see a person that is born with the wrong hormones or both organs but it's them who decide if they fell wrong about it and which person they prefer to be. This time i saw a normal girl who despite the fact that she liked to brawl like a boy she didn't have the wrong feeling about her sexuality or liking women so even the fact that John wanted to hook up with Jane is explained only as he was in love with himself or something like that.Anyways, i found the theme interesting and enjoyable for the most part and it was intriguing until it went too far just for the big twist so i see it like a missed opportunity for something greater. Whoever watches it prepare to be mindblown and mindf... you know.

A man works at a bar, and another man comes to the bar and starts to talk his incredible past. When he begins to talk, he says to him, 'When I was a little girl.'. In that moment, I thought it must be interesting. His past story is beyond our imagination, and the development of the story is amazing. However, his past story is not the main story of this film but just the one step toward the incredible ending. Time traveling and sci-fi are connected cleverly and advance hints are dropped in some scenes, which are a bewildering and twisted structure. Meanwhile, I was moved and attracted by the performance of Sarah Snook who stars a man character and a woman one. When I understood the whole structure, my mind was blown away.

If the ideas seem stale, it is because Heinlein invented them that long ago. As an early libertarian who leaned toward fascism, Heinlein is inherently problematic, but was well educated, imaginative, and creative.That said, this might be the first (if flawed) presentation of transgenderism in popular fiction, in a reasonably respectful way, given the social mores of 1959. For that, Heinlein deserves credit, and this may be the most faithful film rendering of a Heinlein story delivered to date. For those bored by the long bar discussion in the first half -that is how it is told in the story, and there is no better way to present it.To further the paradox, it is a tale that is both dated and, apparently, still ahead of our time - given the top-notch rendition of an old story, it deserves at least 9/10.",Predestination

285,FlixChatter,A great entry to the sci-fi genre – proof that it doesn't take an astronomical budget to tell a GOOD story,8,10 February 2015,"I was intrigued to see Predestination as I was impressed by the Spierig Brothers' previous film 'Daybreakers.' It offers a novelty twist to the popular vampire genre and this time, they tackled another popular Hollywood theme, time travel.I'm not going to say much about the plot as the less you know about it the better the experience. All I'm going to say is that it's based on Robert A. Heinlein's short story All You Zombies. I thought at first there's some similarities to 'Minority Report' about the preventing-a-future-crime from-happening plot, but the story is completely different. In fact, it makes that Spielberg film seems more straight-forward if you can believe that. I like how the film started out with a bang but then the pace slows down considerably in the first act as we're introduced to the characters played by Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook. The odd pacing seems deliberate and I actually think it's pretty effective and engrossing in getting us to care about their journey.Hawke is solid here once again, as he was in 'Daybreakers.' I always think he's an underrated actor as though he's not the most charismatic actor but he's always reliable. There's something soulful about his performance and he's not afraid to show his vulnerable side. But it's Snook who's quite a revelation here. I've never seen the Aussie actress before but she is absolutely astounding. It also helps when she's given a strong character arc here, and she tackled her role as The Unmarried Mother, which is the name of her magazine column she writes for. It's quite a complex role with multiple layers but it's so rewarding to see how she tackles each one convincingly and with so much heart.There's also Noah Taylor as the enigmatic Mr Robertson but for the most part, the story revolves around Hawke and Snook's characters. This film will leave you scratching your head, as most stories dealing with time travel paradox often do. But how the plot unravels is captivating, keeping you guessing whilst you try to grasp just what you're actually witnessing.If you like sci-fi AND time travel movies, this one is a must-see. The cinematography and art direction is wonderful, featuring unique camera angles and excellent production design. It's impressive considering the relatively tiny budget (about $5 mil). It's another proof that one doesn't need an astronomical budget to tell a good story. I'm curious to see what the Spierig brothers will tackle next!",Predestination

The traveler was warned about potential psychosis as a ""minor"" side effect. Sarah Snook was outstanding and worthy of loud, enthusiastic praise. Big thumbs up! The complexity of her character was more than fully realized on any number of levels, although sometimes the stilted writing unavoidably benumbed some of her soliloquies. A great performance. Ethan Hawke sort of plodded along as a plot device too often but I think redeemed himself and transformed my appreciation of the whole picture by his enthusiastically wild embrace of the future self he'd been seeking out when they finally converse in the laundromat. That was a great scene and recontextualized what had come before.",Predestination
288,invernessmovieclub,Refreshing and Intriguing,9,1 September 2014,"****possible spoilers****The Spierig Brothers started their directing career with a low budget zombie film, Undead in 2003 and followed this up in 2010 with bigger budget vampire flick Daybreakers which was relatively successful both commercially and critically. Predestination is a huge step up in terms of scope, writing and overall production quality and is one of the most refreshing and interesting sci-fi movies of recent years. The film begins in New York in 1975 where a shadowy man is trying to diffuse a bomb set by the terrorist The Fizzle Bomber. Horribly disfigured in the attempt, he awakens in the future in hospital with a reconstructed face (Ethan Hawke). We discover he is a ""temporal agent"" for an un-named company who has been on the trail of The Fizzle Bomber for years and is sent back in time to New York to work as a barman in another attempt to apprehend the terrorist. He agrees to listen to a story by mysterious and unusual customer (played by Aussie actress Sarah Snook) as she reveals her past, which builds the foundation of the second half of the movie. Hawke then offers her the chance to change the events which have led her to the present. To expand on the plot further would be to reveal key elements and twists in a time-travelling mind bender of a film.The trailers and posters for Predestination almost suggest it could be an action packed sci-fi but it is in fact an intelligent low-budget character driven thriller with touches of sci-fi. The real strength of the movie is two-fold. Initially the actors - Ethan Hawke gives one of his best performances in years whilst Sarah Snook is a revelation and is destined to be spending a lot more time in Hollywood in years to come. It's a raw, fragile and almost tragic performance and is nothing less than extraordinary. Secondly the writers/directors, The Spierig Brothers have conjured an intriguing premise and succeed in mis-directing the audience at every turn. They reveal occasional clues throughout which fit together into a larger jigsaw whilst keeping you on the edge of your seat for the entire running time. Although this is a fairly meagre budget film, The Spierig Brothers have given Predestination the look of a much larger budget – how they accomplish this is simply astonishing. Based on a 1958 short story, All You Zombies by Robert Heinlein (don't let the title fool you, there are zero undead in this film), Predestination is a truly creative and head-scratcher of a movie. It will keep you guessing until the conclusion and you'll be discussing it for a long time to come. One of the more original movies you'll see this year, or any year.",Predestination

The problem is this, I have seen too many time-travel based movies. There was nothing new under the sun here. It could have been so much more, but instead it settled into a predictable plot, which for me became perfunctory. How about some imagination please? Yes we know its a time thing, but please spice it up a little. Maybe the producers are afraid of confusing the audience with more interesting plots? Not sure. Anyways ruined an absolutely brilliant movie up to the mid-way point.The acting is topnotch, Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook both deliver. The movie production is very well done. I see a lot of people really enjoyed this and that is good, so maybe you will too if you are not too saturated with the whole time travel thing.",Predestination
290,RealBohemian,"No, it's called All You Zombies and the end is totally skewed",6,25 November 2014,"I haven't read all of the reviews, but out of the many I read, only one got it even half right. Far too often reviewers on this site compare a movie to some other recent movie, for as silly a reason as --one example-- ""both movies has some guy kill someone in a park!"". Far too seldom do any of those reviewing ever recognize the actual antecedents of some adaptation or remake. This is one of those, and while it's a decent movie in itself, it so totally changes the ending that it leaves a bad taste to those in the know.Only one reviewer mentioned ""All You Zombies"", the short story written by Robert Heinlein back in '48 that was adapted to film to make this movie. That reviewer felt compelled to assure readers that the movie is not about undead corpses of any kind, which only goes to underline the complete lack of possibility that anyone would understand the point of the original story, which is not in this film at all.That skewing is in itself so profound a loss that it makes the movie merely another well filmed and acted standard time paradox sci fi tale. And Heinlein deserves far better than that, even in a movie unsuitably parsed from his ingenious tale. And it's even more infuriating and stupid given that the movie virtually lifts most of its dialog word for word from the short story. It's not the change of the stint as mother's helper and night classes at a charm school from prior to enlistment in the space angels to after being washed out. It wasn't changing the time machine from a 23 kilo suitcase shaped object to a 20 kilo violin-case shaped object, although that was just too dumb for words for people who supposedly were to blend in, eliciting neither question nor comment wherever they went. It's not changing meeting after kissing her goodbye on her porch to walking away from her in the park. And although this is a MAJOR change, it isn't even that they expanded one small comment about a war ""fizzling"" in 1963 because the protagonist prevented the bomb that was supposed to go off in New York from doing so into the whole point of the story, the entire reason for everything that happened, and even added out of thin air the idea that the guy planting the bomb in 63 was the protagonist.It's that they invented that BS as easier pablum for the masses to swallow than using the real ending. That they fabricated a simple-to-digest, oh-well-you-can-think-about-it but it's not the blow to the heart and head the real ending point would be. Or perhaps, that they did that because they figured the stupid viewers out there couldn't tell the difference between what Heinlein meant and the moronic unending fad of impossibly reanimated corpses wondering about eating people. They expanded one of a few short comments just listing a couple of things that had happened during the lifetime of the temporal agency the protagonist worked for into the point of the story...but the real ending is so far more profound it's terrifying. So terrifying that the stultifyingly stupid change alone can drop the movie's rating to a six despite good filming and acting.Here are the last lines of the story. Hopefully more than stupid pablum loving masses read IMDb reviews; and will see the extreme and significant difference from the last lines of the movie and understand what it meant. And snort at the simplistic-minded change made in the movie.""I know where I came from—but where did all you zombies come from? I felt a headache coming on, but a headache powder is one thing I do not take. I did once—and you all went away. So I crawled into bed and whistled out the light. You aren't really there at all. There isn't anybody but me—Jane—here alone in the dark. I miss you dreadfully!""",Predestination

293,thegene-2,Best example of how not to make a time travel movie.,2,6 May 2015,"I believe the spoilers in this review are not so much about telling you specifics about the story but more about how really bad this film is. Being a die-hard Science Fiction fan, it was very painful to watch this movie. If you want action or thrills or special effects, then watch a Bugs Bunny cartoon, because none of that is in this movie. It is very slow. I'm talking snail slow. And it was very stupid. My wife and I actually could see a lot of what was coming next even though it made little sense. In other words, a somewhat predictable movie because it was so bad, bad, bad. I have yet to see anyone handle time travel very well. The few that do not do a real bad job of it, are ones that make the people and the story and the scenes and all else that goes into a movie, the main focus of the film and time travel is just a little thing in the background. I do not know how it got such a high ratting. That seems almost impossible to me. But then again, I do not understand how millions of humans are murdered in the this country and it is legal. They just call it abortion - and this movie was an abortion. I gave it a 2 because I don't want the person who wrote this story to give up trying. I have always believed that if someone has the ability of writing something this bad, they also have the ability to write something really good - just stay away from time travel. This story defies all logic. I would imagine that for those scientists that do believe time travel is possible in one form or another, this movie would even confuse the crap out of them. I have actually taken time to analyze this movie to see if there is any way to make any sense of it all. I have failed. Just about as bad as the movie failed. It is possible that a lot of the people that gave this movie a high rating did so not based on the movie itself, but more on who stared in it or who directed it, or maybe just liked the violin case. There were so many illogical things in this movie that it boggles the mind how anyone would expect a normal person to even remotely believe what is going on. If you really sit down and take it piece by piece, so much of it makes so little sense it simply fails on every level. I think maybe the writers of such have given up thinking and are more into how do we do something different, regardless if it makes any sense or not. Sort of like if we confuse the audience to a great extent, they will be too confused to realize how bad we did. Here is some detail to justify my feelings. SPECIAL EFFECTS - These were very minimal and on that 10 scale were a 1. Probably a few hundred dollars were spent on them. SCENERY - I am not sure but it looked like that went and looked for the least imaginative and trashy looking places. Not exciting. CHARACTERS - There was only one interesting character which started out as a 10 but by the time we get about halfway into the film, had become a 1. STORY LINE - It started out as a 10 as well, but as you got closer to the end, it dropped down to a 1 as well. TIME PERIOD - This was almost mind boggling. I half expected to see dinosaurs in superman costumes. If I evaluated their time frames, right now we should be on thousands of worlds all over the universe. DETAILS - Details are important in a story. Not so much in how accurate they are but more how well they are shown and explained. Often, watching this movie I would get the feeling that a line was unfinished. Like telling someone ""Please hand me the"" - there just is not enough information in those 4 words to tell you much of anything that you want to know. COMPONENTS FITTING TOGETHER - Too often, things that were going on did not seem to fit together. BOTTOM LINE - Since the show is called Predestination, it seems to indicate that the show represent 2 things. That you can not change destiny and that everything is a time loop that just goes on and on for eternity. I do not believe in predestination myself. I do not believe that from the beginning of time, I was predestined to write this review. I will say one more time - if you want to know how to not make a time travel movie, then watch this movie by all means. I can tell you one thing - if they make a number 2, I don't believe it is predestination - I just believe it is stupid.",Predestination
294,jamestheklein,An outstanding journey.,9,4 January 2015,"I watch a lot of films, and am quite used to being able to figure out what is going on, purely because I have seen films. I often guess correctly that the main character is actually dead, or is two people, or that such and such is another character's long lost son...etc.I came into this film knowing nothing about it. Just that it was supposed to be a bit of a mind-job. I rarely have high expectations with films, and this one surprised me.From the outset I had (correctly) decided who the Fizzle Bomber was. I was correct. A little further in I had decided that one character was the child of another, and that a deliberate untruth had been told. As time went on, I changed my mind about who the Fizzle Bomber was (and was wrong) and then changed my mind again (and was correct again...). However, there were other moments throughout the film that I did not see coming. By the end I had everything all figured out, and the final ten minutes were just confirming my suspicions.This takes nothing away from how great this film was, though. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would recommend it to anyone.Unfortunately, I feel the less you know about it going into it, the better your viewing experience will be.",Predestination

Before watching the movie I read some negative reviews about it and the only reason I saw it because of the high IMDb reading and for that I Salute everybody who gave this a higher rating, because this movie deserves rightfully it and I am sure it will go higher. After seeing the movie I am sure the people who wrote negative reviews were either unable to understand it or don't like the concept of time travel, any one who think that the plot itself has a flaw needs to sit down and think it over and he or she will realize that the 'flaw' is not a flaw at all but is the 'paradox' that this movie is based upon.",Predestination

No cheating the audience whatsoever. The other one that is about the same level of story telling on time travel is perhaps 12 monkeys. Both movies are much better than the cult-fav 'Primer' (aka how Not to tell a time travel story). And much much better than 'Tenet' (aka how to pretend to be smart and use the time travel gimmick to cover the dumb script).,Predestination
302,ianquiksilver,Worst movie I've seen in a some time,1,18 February 2018,"Major disappointment. This is one of those movies which has great potential but where the ""engine"" blows apart at the start line. It almost seems ""nonsense"" was the major topic, rejecting all forms of ""logic"".
For starters its completely unoriginal in that it seeks to show that ""time"" is circular, that one cannot change the future (where haven't we seen that before?) even given time travel. In this regard I thought 12 Monkeys was the best one to showcase this, compared to which Predestination comes off as a sad joke.Its good until about the first half before falling apart and stops making any form of sense.The barkeep gets ""John"" to tell his story in order to confirm its the fizzle bomber (to-be). Why the barkeep doesn't just kill the future fizzle bomber right there is utterly nonsensical as he then proceeds to helping in ""creating"" the bomber. This is the first element in the plot which fails since the Barkeep's only reason for existence at that point is to stop the fizzle bomber.John's storytelling ends on the utter and complete pain and misery felt since the man she (Jane) loved disappeared and how he (John) would love to kill that person, without any doubt or contrition, as a spectator you can almost sense the lust for blood and destruction. And when given the chance to take his/her revenge and realizing that the man who disappeared and caused all that grief was her future male-self, instead of breaking the chain of events, John willingly and knowlingly indulges in history's most amoral love story, and further even has sex with herself and procreates (again, fully knowing of the consequences, ie, the future that unfolds).The barkeep kidnaps Jane and John's ""self-cloned"" baby for reasons unknown, its a needed element in the plot, but it doesn't have any actual justification. At that point the barkeep doesn't know about his 'true' identity yet and has thus no attachment to the baby from what seems two other people.And finally, when the movie does by chance almost manage to get itself back on its feet and towards a good ending, it fails again. When the Barkeep meets his future self and realizes he's the fizzle bomber, instead of again breaking the chain (by committing suicide), he just gives in to 'destiny' and just kills his future self and starts. It also fails to explain why one would need to bomb many to avoid future bigger disasters, in the context of time-travel whereby the Barkeep could find out the single culprit and take him out with a single bullet. We understand that constant time-jumping turns him into a deranged lunatic but still. And then, the final touch, remembering who he was before his facial reconstruction which was meant to tie everything together, fails miserably. Its completely unnecessary and only goes to the disadvantage of the possible appreciation of this movie.I will never watch another movie from the Spierig Brothers and I'm really starting to doubt Ethan Hawke's choice of movies to star in.In conclusion I'd say they tried to do something, it had great potential but they invariably crapped on it big time. I'd give it 0 star if I could, highly unrecommended and worth a re-do.",Predestination

The plot of this film is everything Looper and R.I.P.D. should have been. It completes itself quite literally and for the life of me I can't find any holes in it.

I do warn you though to go into this film without the need to understand EVERYTHING. There might be a few things that just do not make sense to you. That is OK, considering a movie that is based on time travel is apt to do. I pride myself on seeing plot twists prior to the actual event. This movie was able to perform a ""magic trick"" by keeping your attention over to one side while preparing a different surprise on the the other. Well done. Time travel movies always have a paradox in them. Instead of trying to seep that paradox under the rug or trying to explain it, Predestination uses it as it's main plot line. I found myself trying to relate the story to some friends and found the task highly difficult. Hawke was solid in his role and Snook was a pleasant surprise. Highly recommended.",Predestination

A film where you can't wait for the credits to roll so you can start thinking what the hell actually happened. This movie is supposed to be confusing... it deals with time travel for crying out loud. You should know what to expect from a movie that involves time travel. If you like movies that don't tell you it all, that challenge you as a viewer, that keeps you guessing the whole time, and that will inevitably require you to do some kind of retrospective research or reflection... this movie is definitely for you.

Its not easy for someone to understand that and make it into a movie. However, there is a reason that it didn't get 10/10 rating. The purpose. What was all of the purpose of doing that?

I don't want to give the main theme away, but it twists and turns around time travel agents, who are protecting the time line. They are after a mystery terrorist bomber, and I was often left feeling ""Gosh, I didn't see that coming"". No real blood and guts, and very little computer generated stuff. One of the main characters, called John, does an awesome job, and he did an awesome job of acting when I first saw him at the bar. It got me in from the start, and I stayed with it till the end.

334,bushidoie,"Disappointing, confusing, overly convoluted and lacking any true plot",3,27 February 2016,"Okay so I'm going to do my best to avoid giving any spoilers, for anyone truly interested in watching this film, you should have the chance to do so without any prior bearings. HOWEVER, I will say, it is extremely hard to write a review of WHY this is such an unenjoyable film, without mentioning spoilers. So, I'll be using comparisons to other films where necessary.First off, the acting. It's not bad, Ethan Hawke is a one-trick pony but personally I like his style, I enjoyed him in films like Precinct 13. He's his usual reliable self in this film. The other protagonist actor is a mixed bag. Not someone I enjoyed very much, but in some ways that's an awful lot to do with the story given to the individual's character.The opening of the film is filled with plenty of promise, intrigue, good dialogue, fine work between both the protagonists. It's a definite 7 or 8. Up until about half way or maybe even just the incredibly poor, unclear, disjointed final portion of the film, it is actually good.The meat and bones of this movie is a time-travelling story, hence the title, and I know the initial information will say so. Remember Terminator? Interesting story, strange twist, total plot-hole and paradox, and why is the film so awesome, how does it redeem itself? Terminator is full of action and dread, a roller-coaster experience. Predestination is not. I just didn't find anything to redeem it, and it feels a bit like it just never begins and ends properly.Aside from Terminator, and if you've seen that movie, you'll understand the point about paradoxes, this movie also treads the lines of just being a bit too artsy and weighed down by an unclear story. I said in the title, lacking any true plot, and I stand by this, it really just feels like they went for an artsy experience, tried to wow people who are easily wow'ed, and left out anything firm and redeeming with regards to a plot. What makes a good story? A beginning, middle and end. This film lacked an ending, or certainly had an unsatisfying ending.I'd avoid it, personally, if I could time-travel back and tell myself about this movie. If, like me, you didn't like the other protagonist actor within the first 20-30 minutes, then, go with your gut, because that individual is more of a protagonist than Ethan Hawke, he's the supporting actor. And nothing really happens in the film. It's rather like if you took the action scenes out of Tarantino's movies (Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Kill Bill, Hateful Eight for instance), and tried to just have a few scenes of powerful dialogue, then they shrug their shoulders, put out their cigarettes, and walk away without finishing their sentences. Bit boring really, and considering the intrigue and investment at the beginning, it feels like a tease, it's quite frustrating and irritating.Avoid it and watch Terminator instead. Terminator is at least honest about its direction, and feeds you exciting action scenes to keep you interested.",Predestination
335,evans-lester,"Flawed logic, but great anyway",7,5 September 2015,"Contains spoilers..If you ever wanted to understand how Money Creation happens in Western economies, then this film is for you... How so? you may ask... Well modern money creation is a slight of hand, where banks literally create money out of thin air, in essence they commit fraud... So what's this got to do with this movie? Well... creating something out of thin air matches the plot for this film. The main character literally creates themselves out of thin-air, then embarks on a predestined journey spanning a lifetime.Does this logical fraud detract away from what is an otherwise great film? Not really... It has to be said, I was in a state of grippedness during the majority of this film. True, that the first act (as many have pointed out) is somewhat drawn out, it nevertheless plods along serving up many WTF moments, even up until the final act..Whilst time-travel is a key component of this tale, what stood out for me was the story of the characters, and that is the area explored most throughout this film. And let's not ignore the grotesque ""greater good"" sub-text of The Bureau, where the end always justifies the means... What a stark reminder of how our governments shape world events around us based on often sinister justifications.The acting is first class, and my respect for Ethan Hawke's acting abilities has grown due to his performance here. Sarah Snook also gives a solid rendition of her character, and I look forward to seeing more of her in the future.The special effects are used sparingly, and are limited, so more praise should be given the the make-up and editing crews, rather than the digital-SFX team.All in all, a satisfying way to spend a 90 minutes, even if it leaves one feeling somewhat sad for our protagonist(s) tortured lives.",Predestination

Luckily I have a multi region Blu player and I finally put this US Blu Ray in the player last night. Oh my, as a blind purchase, I've never been so happy. A truly special film for a number of reasons.1. The acting is some of the best I have seen in a LONG time 2. The story is rock solid, with so many twists and turns it FLIES BY. 3. Leaves me wanting to watch it again and again. It's incredibly difficult not to give anything away about the film as its best to go in blind to get the full effect of the story. I have to give plaudits to Sarah Snook. An amazing actress who had me in awe. You'll see why. (See, I don't want to give A THING away) I am a bit of a time travel fan, so maybe this hit a home run for me more because of that.

I'm not convinced that this was necessary, but then again, the original story is very pulp and hence intrinsically dated, so I can appreciate that it was reasonable to adapt the story somewhat. I quickly realised when they went to the bar scene, though. Apart from the Fizzle Bomber bit, it's a pretty faithful adaptation of the original story. But the highlight definitely has to be Sarah Snook's performance. Sometimes I could have sworn I was watching Jodie Foster, sometimes Leonardo DiCaprio.

However, most people are missing an obvious flaw in the design. Why is this movie stupid?Lets suppose for a while that time travel exists, even though its ridiculous, and lets suppose there is this bureau of time travel (BTT). At some point in time, someone in BTT decides, that they need an agent (the fact this agent turned into a bomber doesn't matter) that has no past, no family etc. So what did they do? What did they do? Seriously!Did they send Ethan Hawke character to the bar to persuade his younger self to go into the past so he can make love to himself as a woman so he can be born? No, because it would serve one and only PURPOSE and that is TO HAVE ETHAN HAWKE as an agent (bomber)!!! This baby came out of nowhere if you think about it! It is a vicious circle! All the things that happened in the life of Jane/John were made to her/him by herself/himself! And also, when did the bureau first accepted him/her as an agent?

350,d0ugdimmadome,This movie is mind bending,6,20 September 2019,"Okay so I was pretty stoned when I watched this movie and it had absolutely frazzled my mind by the time it ended. Was THC the main benefactor of me tripping out to the twists and turns of Predestination? I don't know. Maybe, but that's not to say this movie isn't mind bending enough on its own.It's hard to talk too deeply about the plot without giving away any of it's twists. We follow Ethan Hawke's character after he has his face melted off by the ""fizzle bomber"", a terrorist he's been chasing through time, which requires him to get a face transplant and become Ethan Hawke. We then see him go back in time to work in a bar, where he strikes up a conversation with Jane, the unmarried mother, who tells him her life story. This part of the movie is completely necessary to set up the upcoming twists, which are easily the highlights of Predestination. However, I personally found it a bit boring and, up until the first twist was revealed, I had absolutely no idea why this random woman's(?) life story had suddenly become centre stage.Some of the twists in the movie are very predictable, but some catch you completely off guard. This might be due to the fact that some of the twists are so outlandish, ridiculous and, well, technically impossible that you'd be considered stupid for predicting them, but this still doesn't stop them from providing a massive upset.Outside of the crazy twists and turns, the movie doesn't offer tonnes of substance (as I said before, the life story of Jane is a bit dull), however, that does not mean there is nothing to enjoy. For me, the twists were enough to firmly hold my interest as I tried to piece the rest of the puzzle together myself, allowing me to feel immersed in the action. However, once the end credits rolled, I couldn't quite get my head around some of the plot details. For instance, the whole paradoxical nature of the plot and the idea of fate playing a part kind of confused me, as the nature of the paradox sort of works against itself in a way and doesn't seem to cause much good when you really think about it, but I'd need a science degree to be able to explain that better.All in all, whilst not exactly perfect (with some slightly dull moments and some details prompting you to question the point of Hawke's entire ""mission""), Predestination will take you on a mind-bending journey, leading you to second guess everything you are seeing just for your concept of reality to be completely shattered again by the next scene.

352,bentheimpaler,Possibly the best Heinlein adaptation ever made.,9,8 May 2021,"Despite his celebrated status as ""The Dean of Science Fiction"", Robert A. Heinlein has had an abusive relationship with adaptations, with mostly just schlocky 1950's UFO movies to show for his libraries of literary vision.Until stumbling into 'Predestination', I had considered 'Starship Troopers' to be the gold-standard, and only by virtue of it's sheer ridiculousness making up in entertainment value what it lacked in faithfulness to it's supposed source material.This film, conversely, drips with Heinlein's style and themes throughout every scene, never shaking my absolute faith that the directors are longtime fans. At the same time, it manages to generally be some of the best in good, old-fashioned science fiction that I have ever seen.In a subgenre rife with plotholes, Predestination's story is smartly executed without becoming pretentious, condescending or convoluted. More impressive still is that it deftly maintains such a balance within the lithe ~90 minute runtime.The story moves along deceptively faster than it first appears, and is no less meticulous in execution than a film of twice the length.If you are a fan of Robert A.

As they slowly unfolded over the last twenty minutes, I have to say my mind was blown. What an awesome finish. The whole film is tied up there and just pulls everything - and I mean every little thing, nothing is extraneous - together so brilliantly.No, you don't get back to the exciting action that the opening scene promised, or that Ethan Hawke movies often bring you - but you don't need that.

This one involves time travel, and the innumerable paradoxes and bizarre outcomes when 'time agents' start over-stepping their brief, to stop crimes before they happen (shades of Minority Report, except here they travel back in time to stop them before they happen).It's a complicated story that starts out as a tragic tale in a bar, but soon morphs into a time travel hunt for a rogue terrorist and other subplots including a kidnapping, at least one romance, revenge, time devices that malfunction, and misplaced life sympathy. You need to watch the ending closely, I didn't get it the first time, and as with most time travel movies, you could probably pick a few holes in the plot which don't entirely make sense. But that doesn't make it less interesting.The key line is one in which a rogue time agent talks about 'a snake forever eating its own tail', which is how the time travel story progressively unfolds.",Predestination

Well, I figured it out and it's sublime, plot holeless and of course most of all extraordinarily brilliant. Let's start with thanking the writers (directors) for this movie. It just shows that it IS actually possible to be this brilliant (and although that's not the point, they even did it in 96 minutes). It easily surpasses close to every movie I've ever seen in how original and boundless and genius it was. I can hardly believe this, on one hand, because this didn't really exist before (even my all-time favorite Inception is less brilliant in its idea), but on the other hand I can; it shows me I was right about the fact that movies could be so much better than they are, and have been. I never really tried that hard but I could imagine that it's possible to come up with something as mind-bending, unpredictable and complicated as this, while still being solid. It should be possible, if it's your job, being a writer. So I thought I could, right the most ingenious plot ever (finishing up my first novel now), but this raised the bar so much I'm not sure at all anymore. Needless to say I loved it; it's my fourth favorite now I guess. Not just for the idea. Every sentence in the movie was in some way of huge importance, certainly in the daringly slow and ""ordinary"" first act (so it can catch you off guard), the atmosphere was unique yet full of possibilities, the look was stylish and intriguing, the actors were great, and their faces nicely cast. The sequence they tell it in... amazing. Enough drama besides the busy plot, great music scores, or realistic silence. All the little (and big) citations, quotes, ideas about time, inevitability, paradoxes and paradoctors, the psychosis. I'm not exaggerating, except if it seems like the perfect movie now. For me, it's close, but most of all it's groundbreaking for mind-bending movies.

Then, suddenly, some things became predictable; I said *some*, not all the plot to the end, so stop jumping on my haircut.I believe that time travel IS doable to the point where we can change our past (AND, thus, our so called present or future): what would the big deal be? -- we'll just relocate in some parallel universe/reality the instant we change a certain past.I also believe that our ONLY unattainable limit is the Absolute Knowledge, since that would mean Absolute Power: a concept that my logic cannot deal with and, therefore, there can't be no god ......",Predestination
361,ajaysinghjaswal-133-244502,Don't Try to Find Logic,9,29 November 2014,"Just when you thought the time travel plots cannot go beyond a certain limit, here comes another movie that takes time travelling to another level. I thought this is it with time travelling when I last watched Looper but Predestination has certainly crossed that mark.Now, I have read many comments that the movie is illogical but then time traveling in itself is an illogical subject, you know that. So if you are planning to watch this movie leave your logical mind behind and enjoy the sheer beauty of the philosophy that lies behind this movie. There is no point in picking up a pen and a paper and start drawing a timeline to find out the starting point. Just as no one can answer the question what came first chicken or egg. One of the starting quotes of the movie. The movie is not illogical in delivering the message that no matter how hard you try you cannot change the future. Even time travelling cannot do that.I don't want to write about plot of the movie because even the slightest information about the movie can be giving out too much. So my recommendation is to go and watch the movie before reading too many reviews. The movie has too many twists but they are well connected which are only interesting if you find them yourself. But I can tell you the movie is beyond sci-fi or thriller genre. The movie is governed by a very strong script which I believe is the prerequisite of such genre. The vicious circle of chicken and egg. The movie stays interesting right from the beginning till the end and even after that it leaves many interesting and confusing thoughts. How do you find a person who has no history?Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook gave a very powerful performance which, I think, is one of the reasons to make this confusing story understandable.I remember The Spierig Brothers from Daybreakers. But this movie hits a higher mark than their previous one. So my recommendation is go and watch the movie. Just one word of caution - the story runs faster and you may be left behind if you get distracted too often. Switch off your phones.",Predestination

It just made it hard to take the movie serious.

Interesting time travel aspect, gets you to think about it and how it would occur. The barman, Ethan, is rugged and I loved his acting. There is a gender bending theme too, makes you feel for people born with both genders, not sure the name. It also brings up a great point - it's never too late to become what you would've been. Great point. Liked the fizzbomber bits. Sarah snook did a great job. Amazingly not even credited by Foxtel who I would like to do a gender reassignment on.

It doesn't really establish its world well enough before diving right into a complex overly twisty storyline. I'm going to also delve into spoilers here in this next section as to why I really disliked the film.The movie is just centered around two huge leaps in logic. The first and most obvious is that Jane HAD to get a sex change. She could have just left the hospital at any time but she stuck around to get a sex change that she didn't want. It made no sense, and is a central aspect of the story. I get that maybe this is some distopian society, although it plays it as our time line through most of the film. Also I just didn't get that sense from those scenes that she was forced to stay there. I see where the Heinlein aspect plays into even though I haven't read the short story. To me is actually felt like one of Phillip K Dick's lesser stories (and yes even He has a few) with all the convoluted plot twists and genderbending. Also the make-up in this movie results in sort of an uncanny valley territory. This seriously made me have less sympathy for Jane. There is no good way to do effects like this as movies with bigger budgets have tried and failed.",Predestination

Much like a good old Agatha Christie book would successfully do.The Spierig brothers keep getting better with each movie and this is a great step forward in what seems to be a promising career.There is nothing new under the Time Travel sun but the delivery is excellent which makes this movie worth watching - at least twice, as any good Time Travel movie requires.",Predestination

Her story progresses and takes up most of the part of the movie. I will leave the further parts for you to watch and decide for yourself. There is also a bomber named ""Fizzler Bomber"" who is planning to take innocent lives in 1970s and an agency based in present is trying to stop him in order to change the course of events thereby changing future.Although I liked the concept of time-travel and paradox shown here but it wasn't executed properly or I would say logically with some explanation in the movie. I would've enjoyed some more elements in writing just to make it a more of a complete story. The time travel just takes place through a USFF Coordinations Transformer Field Kit which is just the fancy name of The Time Machine. It can take a person to around 50 years (in past and future) from the zero point (the year of its invention i.e., 1981). The movie relates Jane's story to the time machine in a way some might find shocking and confusing.However, I was able to predict the entire plot given that I've watched content based on the similar concept already.

I almost turned it off because I took it as another LGBT propaganda film, but after watching it, it's not. The second half of the film is where the mind bending plot magic starts to happen. I am a fairly intelligent person and I found myself guessing, second guessing, and guessing wrong every time. There's no way these bad reviewers could possibly know the plot before it unfolds and I believe just the very premise of the plot makes them uncomfortable. It is, umm, weird, to say the least.I deducted two stars because the first half of the film is so boring and empathy begging, and when I re-watch the film, I will more than likely find myself skipping the first half, which will leave me with a 45 minute movie. The last 45 minutes however, are worth all eight stars. Definitely recommend watching, and definitely recommend watching without reading the spoilers. Also, disregard the bad reviews. I've read them and they really don't make any valid points against it other than that it makes them uncomfortable or they think it's weird or predictable.

Sure, it has some decent acting and will keep your attention until the end, although you can connect the dots quite early. This predictable, ""mindblowing"" mess has been done so many times, and no one gets it right. It looks like a cheap TV-movie for the most parts, and I can just picture the meeting where this MINDBLOWING idea was pitched. The producers heads must have exploded listening to this modern Einstein of a writer. Confusing, and it's not even that confusing, is just not the same as quality brainmelt, but I'm glad others found it entertaining and deep enough to rate it 7 and even 8. Plain 6 from me, so not the end of the world. Second time I've seen it now, and hopefully it will be the last.

The writing was cute, but for me it was the storytelling that kept me interested.As with all time traveling sci-fi films, there are logical leaps. Some viewers will see certain events coming up around the corner, but in no way will that stop them from screaming ""OH SNAP"" when those events occur. In many ways this effect on the viewer falls cleverly in line with the themes of the film.In the end, Predestination has its flaws, but its statements on identity and fate are so strong that they unquestionably transcend any shortcomings. As is the hallmark of great film, all shortcuts taken seem to enhance expression and deepen exploration. Art at its finest and a must watch. 8/10",Predestination

If you haven't, please watch it, it is worth it on streaming services (although I would have felt cheated paying for it.) So, to be clear, I enjoyed it. However, I felt let down by the 'big twist' ending that was telegraphed really early on. Certainly by the point John/Jane meets himself on the park bench it was clear they were all the same person, including the baby and the bomber. The heavy handed way the movie hid faces made it obvious that something like this was going to happen, especially if you have seen or read any other time travel story before.That said, I still enjoyed it up until the last scenes, when they showed the 'reveal.' I thought the movie was going to take it up another level: maybe Robertson is also John/Jane? Maybe the bombing is to prevent a greater tragedy? Maybe John/Jane is destined to invent time travel? Any or all of those would have been interesting endings, or something else entirely, but instead the movie spells out in painful detail the twist it had already revealed at least 30 minutes earlier!My heart sank, was this really it? No great twist at the end? I was really shocked. Such a waste of potential for an otherwise classy and engaging movie? Disappointed beyond belief, I felt as heartbroken as Jane on that bench. I really thought it was going somewhere until suddenly it wasn't.",Predestination
430,keith-lofstrom,Heinlein done right,8,14 February 2015,"For me, this movie is a 10, but most won't like it, and I don't want high ratings to disappoint others.This is a small set movie, filmed in re-purposed locations in Australia. No breathtaking outside shots, mostly indoor and nighttime. Low budget, tightly focused on telling Heinlein's puzzling story visually. Many details added that were not detailed in Robert Heinlein's short-short, replacing exposition with action, but Heinlein's best dialog remains.Two major roles, one minor role, many small parts, hundreds of actors. I imagine most worked for screen credit.The movie portrays the world Heinlein predicted from 1958 (like major space travel), not the world that actually happened. I've never before seen a movie take that kind of risk to remain true to the original story. Given the few screenings in the United States, this faithfulness cost the producers millions in revenue. Don't expect to see such courage in a major film production ever again.I'm glad I lived to see a production of a Heinlein story that respected his storytelling. In a couple of decades, small budget productions will use computers and artificial intelligence to translate text directly to screen, without thousands of people involved, and this kind of faithful rendition will be commonplace, indeed, the cheapest way to produce a coherent movie. Predestination, set in a ""past future"", may be a harbinger of things to come.Few American moviegoers will like this movie. I do not recommend it to everyone, not even to sophisticated viewers with developed notions of what a movie should be. GLBT science fiction fans will have strong feelings about it, both ways. This film is a good introduction to Heinlein's brave explorations of gender, written when Ozzie and Harriet was Hollywood's view of things. My deepest respect to the filmmakers for showcasing uncommon thoughts from that time, and my thanks to the Australian citizens whose tax dollars paid to bring a deeply US-American author to the screen.",Predestination

Tree of Life and Prometheus are a few other recent titles where I felt the same ""I've been ripped off!"" feeling after.To sum it all up (SPOILERS): every main character is not only the same person (Jane, John, the time-traveling agent), but also their own parents through hermaphrodite/self-reproduction. Yeah, messed up. Deep? Not really. Not only that, the agent is attempting to foil a murdering antagonist ""Fizzle Bomber"" from the past, who ALSO turns out to be himself.So, recap: no less than all FIVE of the characters in this film are supposedly the same person. The purpose? Near as I can tell, simply to announce to the viewer: ""HA, DIDN'T SEE THAT COMING, DID YA? GOT YOU!""Not only that, there are multiple plot holes, for example: how does Jane fail to recognize herself, supposedly ""as a male"" John, but the only other noticeable change to be different clothes and shorter hair?! How did John fail to recollect that Jane's vanishing lover as himself? How did the agent fail to recognize that he was having a hand-to- hand brawl with HIMSELF as the Fizzle Bomber (must have been the ponytail, those are QUITE disguising)? And most of all: HOW CAN YOU HAVE SEX WITH YOURSELF TO PRODUCE YOURSELF, TO BE KIDNAPPED BY YOURSELF?!?! How? ""Time travel, my dear, stupid, stupid viewer. Never mind that it's not plausible, just swallow it and admit you didn't see any of that coming."" What is the point of it all? To prove PREDESTINATION (see what they did there?), of course. Do you believe it? Perhaps...if everyone is as ignorant and unobservant as this person, the main character(s).I am extremely disappointed in this movie. I was expecting a time- traveling caper with a plot around circumventing a mastermind serial killer, not a plodding story about a self-impressed, embittered brat, who sees the world to blame for her entire predicament despite later resigning/sentencing herself/himself to it for no reason other than ""it's for the best."" I will admit the mysterious storytelling, at least in the beginning, was entertaining and exciting. The sets and costuming were perfect. Unfortunately, they don't make up for the great big: ""PHOOEY ON YOU!!"" to the viewer revealed in the end. This is one of those movies you WILL think about about you see it, but only to anxiously spout ""BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE!""

The cast is excellent, the production superb, and the entire experience satisfying.This is a movie I have wanted to see made since I was 14, back in 1966. It is the first ever that has not had a serious disappointment factor, as the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit did. To disclose any aspect of the plot would be a cruel spoiler to newcomers, and all I can say is that even if you are familiar with the original short story you will not be disappointed.

I have read a bit of classic science fiction writing but had not come across the short story this was based on, however it was fairly obvious what was going to happen from early on in the movie and what the eventual plot twists were going to be.My wife is of the opinion that the end goal wasn't the point but the journey, however even watching the movie with this mindset still provded me with a general feeling of ""it could have been done a lot better"". There is a Japanese movie ""After School"" that managed to subvert the viewer's expectations extremely well based on what we extrapolate from the scenes and what we accept as general cinematography, and these tricks could have been put to good use here. Alas, we end up with the film that we have here.The highlight for me, however, is the use of filming locations around Melbourne notably the RMIT ""Circular"" building (corner of Swanston and. Victoria streets) being the home of the Space Corp, and the Melbourne University Old Law Quadrangle, when Jane leaves the etiquette lesson. I suspect the park where she gets left is something like the Treasury or Fitzroy gardens but not too sure there.",Predestination

For one very simple reason: the story is so seriously flawed that you're actually deeply disappointed by the ending. It's just plain stupid. At the time I'm writing this, it has a 7.5 rating, here on IMDb, which I simply don't understand. And for one very simple reason: the main character simply cannot exist! Still, even if you consider ""ok, it's just a movie about the extreme paradox, you should just view it as it is"", you still feel it's not up to par. I mean, photography is quite nice, the scarce effects add up (time-travel scenes are so simple, yet so cool), acting is not bad at all (Ethan Hawke has a nice performance, but Sarah Snook totally steals the movie, great actress), but... the story... just leaves you with a sense that the directors wanted to give you that ""6th Sense"" feeling, but fails miserably. They show you Ethan's body, proving he's actually Sarah, but you already knew that a few minutes earlier, from the explosion, where you can clearly see it's her scarred & burnt face, so the ""surprise effect"" is totally lost.The script actually mentions a couple of times the egg-chicken eternal ""who came first?"" question, and if I was to summarize the movie in one sentence, that would probably be it.I wonder what Neil degrasse Tyson would say about this one...",Predestination

I loved this movie. The concept was inspired and structured to perfection. The performances by Ethan Hawke and relative newcomer Sarah Snook were mind-blowing in their interpretations.Without giving away the ""secret"", the plot was reminiscent of only a few mystically charged movies of the past; ""Dead of Night"" for instance is one that has equally perfect recursion.The team that wrote and directed this movie will have perhaps as their greatest challenge, writing something to surpass this film. I fear that it may be overlooked by some critics but I have equal confidence that it may join the likes of other movies that didn't make stronger, initial box office. Regardless, I think the team that made this movie have a great deal to be proud of and I'm definitely looking forward to more from Sarah Snook in the future.This is an experience that I will recommend to others; a near-perfect ""little"" movie that delivers more that most.

Edge Of Tomorrow was amazing as well, but I hate to admit this is far more complex than what was happening with Tom Cruise. *SPOILER ALERT DO NOT READ THE REST OF THIS IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN PREDESTINATION OR EDGE OF TOMORROW.*Time paradox versus (Deja Vu) repeating a day over and over again. They are almost similar, except Tom Cruise was able to break the cycle. I was expecting Ethan Hawke to break the paradox, but instead he becomes blind sighted by the events flying right through his face. Sarah Snook, a fine job mate. Seriously you did a superb job in the whole gender change event.I was disappointed that Noah Taylor's character wasn't really complex at all, and just dropped in at key points in the movie. But he is sort of an imaginary bride to Edge of Tomorrow (If you know what I mean).All in all, I could only wish that I was apart of this masterpiece.

I won't go into plot - of course, it's ridiculous, but just enjoy the clever ride. Ethan Hawke is fine, but the real stand-out performer is Sarah Snook - surely a big star of the future? The device they use for time-travel is sorta 'quirky' - probably the last place you'd imagine it to be, but I see the logic in 'hiding' it in an 'everyday' item!

This movie manages so much with so little effects in an era where the green screen is dominating the genre. I applaud the effort and hope these kind of thought provoking movies continue being made.

For the story to work, the agent had to be an unsuspecting, down to Earth, humanized person and Hawke was perfect for it.Jane (Snook) won me over. I fell in love with her. Then she broke my heart. And then broke my heart again when she was forced to part with herself, thus break her own heart as well.I don't like to know anything about a movie before I plug it in. Nothing. I avoid all trailers and reviews, etc. I purchased it with the assumption and hope that it was a movie relating to the Christian doctrine of predestination.What I got instead was one of the best written, produced, and acted sci-fi dramas I've ever seen--one that had absolutely nothing to do with my expectations and in fact exceeded them immensely.I'm not really a movie buff. I am extremely picky and almost always walk away disappointed. What I look for is a movie that went under the radar, wasn't over-hyped, and doesn't contain immersion-preventing flaws. Well.

455,wad-maq,One of the best movies I have watched in 2014,8,30 November 2014,"After I watched this movie I was amazed by how the writer can think of such a complected twist, its very clever story. before I watch the movie I watched the trailer and I expected to see an action movie with travel in time plot like the movie ""Looper"" but I have been surprised with a dramatic touching story and twists through all the way until the last scene.In my opinion, this is one of the best of Ethan Hawkes performances in a long time and Sarah snook acted well I have watched one of her movies recently called ""Jessebelle"". the movie was not bad horror.I think Predestination its unique American storytelling movie like the Movie ""Fight Club"" is an original idea and never done before in this way.

456,eido888,Entertaining,8,25 November 2014,"Having watched this movie without any expectations, have found it to be a peace of philosophical art (in some sense). I loved the whole story and the complexity that it offers. Compared to the recent movie plot attempts to have the viewer intrigued and surprised with the ending, this movie brings me back the days where story-lines do not have proper clichéd twists and endings.And this is where things get messy. people who get the concept in detail will love the movie, while others who miss one or two details will find it ridiculous. In all cases, it is nicely done. The depth of the plot surpasses the basic tier 2 setup and ventures even deeper. With the introduction of a well acted, scripted and presented film, the plot of Predestination is a great brain teaser to solve.If anything, this movie brings the whole ""Which came first, the chicken or the egg?"" into a new perspective.",Predestination

This film ranks up there with some of the greater time travel movies, thought provoking, and thriller genre as a whole. You are guessing from the moment the film starts until, at the very end you are finally able to put together the twists and turns. Definitely one of those films that you must see more than once. Ethan Hawke does a tremendous job making this film believable with his dialogue sequences. I give it an 8/10 just for the fact that if you are into sci-fi time travel or even films that always keep you guessing it is worth a view if not two.",Predestination
458,lets_play_two,Not for those who demand more than a good story,6,28 December 2020,"(Better options to watch are at the end of this review.)Predestination offers a moderately compelling story free of detrimental plot holes or logical inconsistencies. Its central concept is also likely to be novel to the first-time viewer.Where the film suffers is in its presentation. Most of the script is narration or explanatory monologue, the latter often delivered over cut scenes of what's being described. While these narrative techniques are not unusual, they are best used sparingly; Predestination is Exhibit A in the case for why.Think of a thriller where a central character explains a discovery or final twist as you see action that was hidden from you up until that point. Or a character study or biopic that opens with the protagonist laying the groundwork for the rest of the story with some critical details upfront. Now imagine that technique used for most of a film. Have you heard of ""show, don't tell?"" Predestination is all tell.I'll concede that there are excellent productions that use these techniques to this degree, but they demand two prerequisites: a standout script and first-class acting. Dialogue must be profound and tight, free of filler. The acting must be so exceptional that you forget they're acting at all. Without either -- or in this case, both -- the presentation quickly grows tired and burdensome. The Man from Earth is a good parallel from the modern sci-fi canon that actually suffers a disastrous fate from its even worse marks in both measures.Ultimately Predestination is an average film, a far cry from the masterpiece or disaster that other reviewers would have you believe.Similar titles I'd recommend you watch instead: Moon, Looper, Edge of Tomorrow, Minority Report, Inception, Interstellar, Never Let Me Go, The One I Love, Sunshine, Donnie Darko, Source Code, Twelve Monkeys, Gattaca",Predestination

It is totally underrated, which is not much of a surprise, because as mostly people who don't get to understand something they go like ""This is crap"" that is unfair . Unfair to the ones who showed it, who made it.(spoiler alert)There's a song in the movie ""I'm My Own Grandpa"" which pretty much sums up the whole movie . You'll know if you've watched it . (spoiler alert)Even Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook having the same lighters can tell you that. It is smoothly slow, There's less action and more mystery, how a time-traveling movie should be . The Spierig Brothers are good with direction, but I wouldn't say the best . The movie is based on Shot-Story 'All You Zombies' by Robert Heinlein .Ethan Hawke is a very good actor he can show versatility even in a single character as he has shown in this one .This is the first time I've watched Sarah Snook act and I'd say I'm impressed . The way she handled the two parts of her character, I loved it . Impressive part is the movie only takes one and a half hour to Impress you! Must watch. My Rating 8/10",Predestination

BUT every time time travel is involved a lot of paradoxes are bound to happen. SPOILER : When traveling back for the first time, Jane meets herself in the past. If you allow this to happen in the storyline, then every action you repeat in the past should be repeated as well. Ethan Hawke should meet himself while delivering the baby to the orphanage and there should be an infinite amount of identical babies dropped at the orphanage due to a ""mirror-in-mirror"" - like effect since John/Jane do it all. Every time the story loops, there should be a multiplication of characters. I understand this would make the movie impossible to make, but I cannot see it as anything as a ""mistake"".

How did that get the okay?The overall story is a decent concept, but it's rather obvious, and presented in a only a moderately compelling manner.I think the acting is the bright spot in the film.

Interesting from the beginning, story becomes better and better as The Barkeep's (a.k.a. temporal agent) and John's story becomes intertwined, but in the end there is one major thing making everything impossible: No matter how they jump, there can be no baby Jane, Jane and John at the same time. First there must be a baby so that it grows up as Jane. But there can be no baby without both John and Jane. Even with the time machine the constellation is impossible. It may all be possible (we could talk more about Jane, John and Barkeep and if it can or can not play like that) if only the baby originated from somebody else. Without this ""snake that eats one's tail"" situation, and ""what is older chicken or egg"" repetition throughout the movie (check Trivia section - it is full of that kind of insinuations) I would rate it a nine.

469,rayjsan1211-668-93869,What if God is our Final Destination and we are the predestination,8,28 December 2014,"Normally I had hate to use religious context and quotes to review a movie but the ideology of this movie is based upon the very popular beliefs of Christianity.The moral this movie leads us to is a thought of a popular beliefs in Christianity by' Augustine of Hippo who argued that since the fall all humanity is in self-imposed bondage to sin. All people are inescapably predisposed to evil prior to any actual choice, and unable to not sin.Free will is not taken away in the sense of the ability to choose between alternatives, but people are unable to make these choices in service to God rather than self. Thomas Aquinas also taught that people are not able to avoid sin after the fall, and that this entailed a loss of original righteousness or sinlessness, as well as concupiscence or selfish desire.'-Wikipedia(source uncredited, Topic:Total Depravity). If I tell you that imagine yourself at point A, where your life is going as per the set of designs that you choose and were not forcibly made to choose, and at that very juncture I make you fall, its an endless cycle, a cycle of depravity and inevitability where we are made to run towards the very designs of choices of someone else but not ourselves. We then derive at the belief that what if God is actually 'our' final destination that they don't lie when they say we are all part of God and in order to change our own destiny God made Earth and choose not to give knowledge to man so that he doesn't falls in depravity at the final destination but when he does falls into depravity by choice, God leaves the side of humans because he already knows the outcome at that point. This would also suggest that there is a point A in the plot because in order for the predestination to take place, John/Jane Doe must be born first at one point, only after which can the cycle be made to repeat, which explains the work of Evil interfering with God's ultimate plan. The movie is simply trying to tell us that,'We have a choice in it, while we don't have a choice in it'The grasp of inevitability as we say is felt at an ever more heightened level when we see this movie.This movie was actually under appreciated and in my eyes is a really great work during the year 2014 and deserves a big round of applause.Some people may criticize that belief because it is true, that we need for the belief of the inevitable cycle to set its course at a particular time somewhere from a given reality, which is why I mentioned point 'A', the point of all origin where the choice is actually not lost but where the conspirators of inevitability choose to interfere and disrupt the cycle to pre-destine it in order to change the design.There is a bit of predictability in the movie but it is a real amazing twist which you don't really expect to happen in real life but which is happening just like the movie itself.The work in the script of this movie and directing and acting is astonishingly tremendous, it can neither be said to be a scientifically flawed adaptation nor religiously incorrect, because there is always 'that doubt'.The characters could have been more daunting and capturing but its actually very difficult to make it so because the essence of this movie directs the idea directly into your head. 'Like you already have known it, and you already have been here'.I don't think the unfolding of the plot in this movie wouldn't leave people a little disappointed, but when they match the actual 'belief' and compare it with their day-to-day life they will feel widely attached to the message of this movie 'Inevitability'.You are in for it :D",Predestination

471,adrianheinrich1987,Less Time-travel then promised,6,7 February 2015,"Writing a review on this greatly crafted film is a really hard feat.While I was promised that this would be a time traveling movie, I was bitterly disappointed on how the directors decided to tell the story. The story itself for me is not the problem here. I believe it was the way it was told, that made me dislike the movie more, then expected.First of all, I think the filmmaking is very solid. The cinematography is nice looking and fits the tone of the film. The editing likewise feels very comfortably to watch and it helps the story, that the directors intended to show.Now here comes the problem.+++Spoiler Alert+++The film starts with a voice over narration and we get to know Ethan Hawks character bit by bit. It is here where the filmmakers offer the first set of clues to how the story unfolds. One might even start to grasp the ending. I was very intrigued by the Prologue and was hungry for more.Sadly the filmmakers disappoint me for the next 50 or so minutes. When Ethan Hawks character, a time traveler agent from the 1990s, meets a young man at a bar in the 1970s, the man starts to tell his life story. Soon enough I got bored, while watching him talk about a life so absurdly weird, that I loose interest in the plot. While in the middle of the whole film I have already figured out 80% of the story and the ending has become very predictable.Yet the last 30 minutes of the film makes this movie somewhat extraordinarily complete. It made sense to tell the story, how the Spierig Brothers told them, yet I was not nearly as satisfied as I wished I could have been with a great potential for this plot.",Predestination

It is a brilliant plot which does involve time travel , and I won't spoil a moment for you. It does illuminate some very intricate ""what if"" scenarios but it was the excellent plot that hooked me. But the delivery of a brilliant story was lacklustre. Don't get me wrong, the special effects did their job, Ethan Hawke was pretty good, as was the whole cast. But the Editor/Director should have slashed the first half of the movie to quarter of its dull rambling self and this could have been a classic. So 8/10 for the second half of the movie.

I'm surprised this film didn't get more praise i found it very entertaining and it keeps you guessing till the very end i personally didn't guess the twist at the end and i am usually very good at guessing them and i defiantly did not guess that The Fizzle bomber was actually Ethan Hawke let alone Hawke being the older version of Snook's character Jane/John doe as his face gets badly burnt while chasing the Fizzler bomber and gets reconstructed into that of Hawke's. so overall very entertaining film two thumbs up would definitely recommend,Predestination

The gentleman at the bar begins to tell his story and strangely enough he comes across a space travel agency (at the beginning of the film we understand that the main character is a time traveler, as he observes the events of 1975 and states that this terrorist has always eluded him and for one last time he must capture him). The obvious cues and references rather than making us realize at the end of the film all the minute details that the two directors have asserted in the film, seem at most trivial to emphasize a plot already carved out.Nevertheless, it's not a bad movie and not everything is immediately understood.

492,kieranpicken,An elegantly shot depiction of a limited idea,5,28 October 2020,"There is a kind of elegance to Predestination. It has one, simple idea and it depicts it with clarity. It is possibly the ultimate high-concept movie in that regard, except that putting its idea: 'a time-travelling cop who is also a time-travelling terrorist creates themselves in an endless time loop with echoes of the myths of Tiresias and Sisyphus' would probably not have convinced Jerry Bruckheimer to get behind it.Ethan Hawke is doing a fair job, with that constipated look actors sometimes do to convey prolonged mental anguish. Sarah Snook is definitely given more to do and she does it very well.It's a solid premise with some solid performances and the idea holds the promise of playing with ideas about gender, sanity, mortality, morality and innocence (i.e. lots of binaries creating unities, closing circles, you get the idea).The problem is that once it has set up the 'how to' bit, the mechanics of how the time-loop is created, it runs out of time. None of these ideas are really explored, just hinted at. Noises off.I often am moved to write a review of either movies which fail to fulfil their promise - The Haunting of Bly Manor - or ones which by successfully exploring their ideas provoke something approaching enlightenment - Arrival or Blade Runner 2049 come to mind. Predestination is unusual in that it successfully explains its apparently intriguing core idea, only for the end result to be less than the sum of its parts.All in all, an oddity that I'll probably remember but not with any great emotional or intellectual fondness.",Predestination

This was a very short and sweet one and a half hour ride... I mean you got serious twists and turns in 90 mins that didnt demand a slow burn of 20+ hrs to build characters and story.If you like movies that have an intense storytelling in the first half ( snook ! ) and an unraveling puzzle in the second then this is for you.The ending is satisfying and will leave you thinking .. which came first .. the chicken or the egg ?,Predestination
499,Euphoric-Gecko,"Creative, thought provoking and emotionally stimulating",10,13 March 2015,"I'm not entirely sure how to write a review on a film that i loved other than to say it has these great points:-Great plot line (creates questions and takes you on a journey full of twists and turns... some i saw coming, some i did not)-Outstanding performances by the lead roles with brilliant dialogue-Relates the fantasy (sci-fi) side of time travel extremely well to the context of the film-Excellent cinematographyUsually i like to look for criticisms in films. In this one i couldn't find any. Often with films like these the endings are ruined yet i felt this one wrapped things up as well as i could have imagined, leaving me with just a few small points to ponder as every brilliant thriller should. I'm sure critics will come up with ""plot holes"" and tandem theories about the movie. However, i felt that this one was hit out of the park. All parts that make up the film did an excellent job.Final Advice: Excellent film. Well worth watching. It will require your full attention so would wait until you're in the right mood and environment before settling in (or going out - depending where you are) to watch.

500,g_babic,Faithful yet lovingly enhanced story,9,9 September 2014,"This is not just classic sci-fi it is almost a classic Greek play: Fateful and tragic. That's the parting feeling. But it delivers so many genres on any level you care to enjoy it. To me the strength of this film is the characters—every day people like ourselves—seeing themselves in an extraordinary light. As time-travel stories go there are none of the paradoxes of other such films to frustrate you. The elegant, thought-provoking symmetry of the original short story is respected beautifully—but hats off to the directors for expanding it into a study of human self-identity. In my opinion the best sci-fi only uses fantasy (within the realms of possibility) to explore humanity in ways that a grounding in known reality cannot, and this film offers viewers a 'what if' so believably presented they can put themselves in that situation and question themselves in a way they normally never would. The only paradox here is the very real inescapable self of all of us and yet being so many different people throughout our lives. You will benefit from seeing this film.",Predestination
501,fearlesswarrior90,Disregards basic concepts of science and twists suck,1,11 December 2017,"So I won't criticize the whole time travel portion of the story since I'm of the belief that you can do whatever you want with time travel in a movie as long as it follows the logic you set up for it in your story. What I will criticize is the science behind one of the big twists. Since this will involve spoilers, there's the warning up top, and then I'll leave some space after this sentence so that you can avoid it. Ready? Here we go...There is no possible way that any human can go back in time and give birth to themselves. I'll give you the fact that if it was possible for an individual that has both sex organs to impregnate themselves (most recent studies have shown that there would be a dominant sex organ so one or the other would function exactly the way its supposed to), there would be no way for someone to be able to give birth to themselves (unless they were the already fertilized egg that was implanted into a host body). You would create an entirely new human. An idiotic twist that defies any semblance of logic that was simply made to be a ""bet you didn't see that coming"" moment (God knows this movie needed one of those considering all the other twists were easy to guess). Ugh, this movie sucked. The plot doesn't kick into gear until almost two thirds into the movie, the twists all come rapid fire after that (and if you've seen even one time travel movie involving crime in the past, you'll guess all them). Avoid at all cost.",Predestination
502,beck222,"Sounds great, but doesn't deliver.",6,27 January 2015,"When I sat down to watch this movie I was looking forward to an intelligent science fiction ride. I also thought from the plot overviews I'd read that it would be full of action as well. I'm also a big fan of Ethan Hawke, and so I thought it would be good because he usually makes great film choices.The viewing experience was, however, tepid. The acting was great, and there were a few nice cinematic shots and edits, but overall it was a let down. I hadn't realised the first half would be so slow (there's a lot sitting and talking), and at the end (I'm not spoiling) when the narrative and editing style made it clear the audience was meant to be in shock at the big revelation my husband and I looked at each other in surprise and said, ""Really? They honestly think we hadn't worked this out an hour ago?""Predestination had potential, but it wasn't reached.",Predestination
503,MobiusJedi,Mind NOT Blown,4,7 January 2016,"First, a spoiler free summary.The only way for a buff like myself to possibly enjoy this movie is to imagine it as a morality tale about the unique propensity of bureaucracy to go to enormous effort and expenditure to achieve nothing.This is not SciFi, either, and doesn't hold a candle to films like Looper, or Primer, or even the Terminator saga. It was obviously made on the pretense of blowing away minds the way Memento or Inception does the first time, but for me and other buffs, it utterly fails to deliver.In this thriller-mystery-drama, Ethan Hawke does what he always does: delivers a solid performance. He is not alone, the character drama is actually rather compelling. Unfortunately, what I just watched was not actually a character drama. The initial setup of action and intrigue promises a pace which is unfortunately not delivered, as events quickly slow down and the story becomes pure drama. (Also awkward when new information about the world the story is in was introduced long after the audience's suspension of disbelief.) Finally, as there often are in thrillers, there's the big reveal. Well, not so big actually. If you, the viewer, are a movie buff and/or know how to pay attention, the details are all there and you already knew the reveal a full half hour before the big moment. Even without the certainty of knowing, there was little room for other possibilities. Oh well, we have to wait for the rest of the class to catch up, I suppose, but for the entire length of the film? Worse yet, nothing comes of it! The movie ends wrapping up what anyone who didn't fall asleep or leave the room should already know, but doesn't give any resolution to the story or the main character whatsoever. A wasted ending is a waste of the entire movie.SPOILER ZONEThis movie answers only one ridiculous question, badly, ""What came first the, chicken or the egg?"" But the real question is: ""What would happen if I could go back in time as a man and have sex with myself as a woman?""Apparently, you have yourself as a baby, and waste a good opportunity of a film explaining a paradox loop that couldn't possibly exist!""How do you have yourself as a baby?"" one might inquire. Well, since future-you can time travel, he sets present-you up on a little self- date with past woman-you (before the childbirth-induced sex change you already had.) Then, while you're busy having possibly the creepiest off-camera sex imaginable, future-you travels to the day woman-you gave birth and brings the newborn back in time to leave her on the doorstep of the orphanage where you grew up.The baby is you, as we have spent much of the movie until now learning.But wait, there's more! After future-you (who by the way you don't recognize is yourself because of facial reconstruction from the bomb that will eventually blow up your face while you're trying to stop future-future-you from killing thousands of New Yorkers) drops you off as a temporal agent, he makes his last jump, to retire in New York, approaching the date of the infamous bombing future-you was trying to prevent. Of course, the time travel device has an error decommissioning like it was supposed to do. Also, future-you doesn't realize that future-future-you is the infamous bomber you've spent your time-traveling career pursuing (shame on any audience member who didn't already expect that at this point) until coming face-to- face with him before the bombing. Long story short, future-future you is a little unhinged, as the voice-over will explain for the third time is symptomatic of excessive time travel, and future-you shoots future-future-you, which is what future-future-you claims creates himself in the first place.If you're still curious, just what is it that's so poorly done? Let me just preface, I fail to see how this has received such praise. This is the poor man's Looper, and doesn't set up a paradox nearly as masterfully. The foreshadowing is so thick when the barkeep is singing along to the jukebox ""I am my own grandpa,"" besides how obviously intentional the camera-work was to hide certain faces and figures from view in the first scene of the struggle with the bomb, that the movie doesn't actually leave any guesswork.But here are my two main, unforgivable gripes.One, as I mentioned up top, the premise of the self-perpetuating paradox loop is ridiculous. It's a closed loop. This movie tries to answer the chicken-egg question by making the chicken hatch the very egg it hatched from before growing up to lay said egg. The chicken is the egg, that's the paradox. Hence, how this is not SciFi (further, much like everything in Star Wars, which similarly is not SciFi, there's no reason any of the technology works, it just works.) If you actually think about it, there's absolutely no reason to accept that this paradox loop is simply a matter of predestination.Two, the movie ends with Hawke (future-you in the above breakdown) distraught, piecing everything together for the slow audience members, and by the look of it, descending into the madness which will create his future fizzle-bomber self, since (presumably being the temporal agency boss Robertson's doing) the time travel device still works. But that's all there is, it just ends showing us (big reveal!) the mastectomy and c-section scars to prove that, yes, he's definitely the same person as the brand new temporal agent he just left at the agency, who gave birth to him/herself by impregnating him/herself. For all that Hawke's character has to say about purpose, this story has none.I blame George Lucas and his Medichlorians.If you want time paradox, go watch Primer.",Predestination

I am not a fan of Ethan Hawke to be honest, but i found his performance impressive. I don't remember the gal's name that played the main character but wow she was amazing also. What a diverse character to take on and she did it perfectly. I wish some things, regarding the time travel, had been explained in more detail.

The plot is some thing out of a child's mind, time travel part is what sells the movie through out and you will watch it to the end because of that but at the end you feel like you've just wasted precious time of your life because people like us who like Sci-fi films are sold something like this because it has time travel in it.

There are so many time travel wannabe movies that fall short or leave huge holes in the plot. I have to say that this was a nice twist on an old concept. It was well directed, and the structure of the film had more than a pinch of salt from the recipe of a successful M. Night Shyamalan movie. It leaves you asking yourself if you really understood what you just watched but like all time travel movie fans you'll insist it all makes sense as you struggle to unravel it in your head.

509,me-990-625788,Contains spoiler - maybe,10,19 April 2015,"Good. Very good adaptation.Heinlein's stories are a rich vein if there is a director who can get over him/herself and just tell a story.This is one of those examples of telling a story and doing it very well. But with so little original detail in the Heinlein story (""All You Zombies"") it must have been very hard to keep the original story line with few embellishments; there IS a lot of detail filled in which didn't detract from the original at all, I didn't think. The directors who wrote the screenplay kept most every detail and all the dialogue - including the name of the bourbon in the bar - filling in the blanks in ways that added, not subtracted, from the overall story. Taking what is basically a 7 page short story written in a day and turning it into a full-length feature film screenplay took a lot of guts and imagination and was done very well.So much so I bought the BluRay.Very few of Heinlein's stories have been brought to film, besides the total abortion/monstrosity ""Starship Troopers"" there were two others that come to mind, ""The Puppet Masters"" was done well, as was ""Destination Moon"" but this last one he himself worked on directly.I'd like very much to see ""Stranger in a Strange Land,"" ""Time Enough for Love,"" or ""The Moon is a Harsh Mistress"" brought to the silver screen, but I doubt this will happen in my lifetime.Following on the heels of ""Predestination"" I'd REALLY like to see ""By His Bootstraps"" which could be done very easily, cheaply as there is basically only ONE actor - a few extras with few speaking lines - and is a story that, like Predistination, if told right, will have you want to go back to the beginning and watch it all over again because you just KNOW you missed something.Look at the level of ""quality"" coming out of Hollyweird these days in SYFY films. They're all visually stunning, but the screenplays seem to have been written by the same 8th graders. The stories are stale and lifeless and cater to the same group of mouth-breathing snap- chatters who are simply looking for non-selection, indiscriminate endless entertainment.************************April 19. Watched this last night with my son, a (very) amateur actor (his roommate is a film major, son biology/animal behavior and acts in his roomie's films), and for me, the third time, I find the story growing on me more and more.A love story.Some weirdness for sure. Heinlein's stories are FULL of ambiguous/oblique references to homosexuality and other aspects of sexual expression and repression. Time travel stories are full of the ""I'm My Own Grandpa"" type references - the Ray Stevens song plays in the background of the bar at one point.It occurred to me that a comment made by Robertson regarding the barkeep being a unique, one of a kind agent, no ancestry ""like a worm eating its tail"" the barkeep replies, puts a LOT of the film into perspective. You need to pay attention. There's a lot more going on than meets the eye.There are THREE separate time loops in this film. See if you can figure out where they are.Jane, John, Barkeep, Fizzle Bomber are caught in them.And where does Robertson come from? The director said he was necessary, I think he represents the ubiquitous, wise, all-knowing, kind, benevolent ""controller"" or manager Heinlein injected into a lot of his stories and yes, was an implied, yet missing element from ""All You Zombies."" Think he set up the non-decommissioning time machine? I'm surprised this movie didn't get a wider release, the acting is enjoyable, the dialogue simple, real, full of hidden clues.You'll want to watch it over and over again.",Predestination

512,Bunk7,Interesting but completely illogical,8,28 November 2014,"I've just watched the movie Predestination. Let me start by saying that going in I had no idea what the movie was about. I haven't seen any trailers prior to the movie, and i didn't even know that Ethan Hawke was in it or that it involves time travel ... so i was quite surprised and intrigued when I found out that the movie was about a time traveling agent on his final assignment,where while pursuing the one criminal that has eluded him throughout time he is also recruiting his younger self.After watching the movie i thought the film it self was quite interesting and well made, the actors did a solid job and the story line was quite original even though completely illogical! .. Allow me to elaborate :) As with most time travel movies the stories time line in this movie is quite complex and can get a bit confusing especially if you try to make it fit in the narrow frames of logic,which I usually don't recommend when watching any sci-fi/time travel movie ... but never the less after watching the movie i tried to make some sort of logic out of it, so i took a pen and paper and started drawing a time line that would help me better understand the logic of the movie and the original time line ... but then it hit me. The basic problem of the movies time line boils down to one simple question (hinted in the bar scene)»What comes first the chicken or the egg?« or applied to the time line in this movie what came first in the original time line? her being born, or her giving birth (to her self that is). Of Course as with most time line movies this question doesn't have a logical answer as it is by default completely illogical. The time line is basically a »snake eating its own tale« with no way of knowing when it took the first bite... as i said interesting and entertaining but completely illogical! :)",Predestination

I did not know the name Sarah Snook, but I will now seek out her past & future works - Count me as an impressed new fan. The first half of the film seems unrelated to sci-fi, and is more about character building, mainly about the 2 main characters with a lot of talking, just like many of the best plays (Likely a real turn-off for SPFX fans).

Well, apparently the makers of the film have inserted the necessary references in 0:28, 0:33, 0:51, 1:09, 1:18 also.The ""rooster"" can be thought of as Mr Robertson who obviously orchestrated the entire chain of which-came-first problem, who needed someone outside the system, outside the bureaucracy which would never agree to the idea of Fizzle Bomber, but yet badly needed to solve so many problems.He created the chain of events that led to the creation of the chicken-egg that is, probably making illegal jumps over a short period of his own time (which is why he looks the same throughout the movie) starting with his discovery of the unique talent that he turned into Mr Fizzle (eventually), in 0:28.",Predestination

First of all most of the critics might have given him a harsh review because they felt that it was not possible but let me be clear that so far in reality we have not been successful in time travel, so we have absolutely no idea what can really happen if one can actually time travel and it's a sci-fi film so lets just give the directors credit for they have achieved with this movie.You have to keep in mind that every other time flick movie you have watched so far are mostly based on a time line that represents a straight line while in this one it is a time loop it doesn't have a starting or ending point. I know it sounds crazy but if you can accept that and watch the movie it will really help you enjoy the movie. Hence the name Predestination.It is a story about a special person(male/female) who is caught in the time paradox and how he is affected by time traveling. Time is one of the most powerful influences. It influences his thoughts, feelings and actions and in the end he has no control over them. The movie starts with a time traveling agent on a mission to stop a serial bomber. He meets a mysterious guy(Sarah Snook(she was amazing in the way how she portrayed the character)) who has an extraordinary story to tell him. The time traveling agent recruits him because he wants to use him. Anything more about the story would be a spoiler.

How did Robertson first find Jane/John or he must have created the killer in the first place then changed his past?? who know this might be it...

It all comes together nicely after a long drawn out 45 minutes of viewing which, to some, may seem a bit long and pointless, but when you realize how pivotal it is to the plot it all makes sense.Even once you know exactly what is going on you will still be wrapping your brain around the whole logic of the movie.

Wouldn't they both find this just a little creepy and incestuous? This script is totally ludicrous and beyond comprehension.

Jane makes you so sad about her past and so angry at those who wronged her that you find yourself with clenched fists and gritting teeth. Her story really taps into that primal, protective instinct that would make you jump in front of a bus to save someone you care deeply about.And beyond the emotional heavy hits, there is plenty here for the mind as well. The time travel paradoxes are truly a breath of fresh air, and the movie plays like a perfect puzzle that gently reveals itself in front of you and makes your neurons dance in glee.I've been waiting since Inception to watch a movie that would make my jaw drop -- 5 years I have waited to watch a great movie.This was a masterpiece.",Predestination
541,harshanalluru,A Brilliant Time Travel Paradox By The Spierig Brothers,10,15 August 2016,"Predestination directed by The Spierig Brothers, is said to be one of the finest time-travel movies ever made. The film is an adaptation of Robert Heinlein's short story ""All You Zombies"". Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook played the key roles in the film. A brief introduction of the film is as follows. Ethan Hawke's character works for an organization which is able to travel through time to prevent atrocities and human disasters that would be happening in future. After the title rolls, Ethan Hawke is shown as a barkeep, a guy starts describing his story to him. Later they travel back in time to change things that had happened. It would be a spoiler if I reveal more than this. The film is more interesting due to its thriller-elements.The Spierig Brothers handled the film well even though it has a script that is too complex. The way they cast-ed the roles is apt for the film, Sarah Snook definitely stands out of the crowd by her performance. Her role has many tricky scenes, that the film could have been a disaster if not handled carefully. Moving on to the technicalities, the whole film is crafted well with enough production values and good background scores despite of its low budget.Predestination, is a unique kind of movie in it's genre. It invokes thinking in the audience about its world. I would rate the film 9/10. It is definitely more than a one-time watch.",Predestination

The characters had such dismal and sad lives, it was painful to watch. When the unique twist started to unfold finally, you just didn't really care.

The bartender is the temporal agent and John is bartender which means Jane and John and the bartender and the daughter of Jane and John and bartender is Jane and John and bartender and a temporal agent. Now, Jane is a writer with a pen name The unmarried mother and Jane is John and bartender and her own daughter that means the John and the bartender and the daughter of Jane and John and temporal agent is unmarried mother.

The bartender kill the fizzle bomber i.e Jane and John and the bartender and the daughter of Jane and John and bartender kills Jane and John and the bartender and the daughter of Jane and John and bartender. And, John marry Jane which again means Jane and John and the bartender and the daughter of Jane and John and bartender is married Jane and John and the bartender and the daughter of Jane and John and bartender.

However, half-way through Predestination you realise that the movie is just one big long exposition scene. And the vessel through which they convey this story is at best, poor, at worst, incredibly contrived: Woman walks into a bar and says to barman ""I have a really good story to tell you,"" barman says ""that's interesting, please tell."" From then on almost the entire plot is driven from narration. To quote Brian Cox in Adaptation, ""God help you if you use voice-over in your work, my friends. God help you. That's flaccid, sloppy writing."" And sadly this movie is a prime example.The writers also got a little carried away with the plot-twists. They are 4 major plot twists, and by the fourth, they are really flogging a dead horse. And plot revelations become increasingly more banal and contrived. The writers also leave no room for interpretation or for the viewer to come to the conclusion themselves. This move is as subtle as a block-splitter.Don't get me wrong, the story is inventive, and certainly brings a new twist to the clichéd and overused, ""man goes back in time to change the past and right some wrong"" storyline. However by the end of the film I didn't feel the audio-visual experience delivered anything extra than reading the script would have.",Predestination

554,ellesadatt,Original but Illogical,6,11 February 2019,"I liked the movie because it was original, BUT it had lots and lots of flaws.
Seems like they just wanted to make a movie that is original and suprises people by its mind bending ending, but they stopped caring about details and logics.I can't mention all of the flaws, as there are many, but here are ""some"" of the flaws ;
1)So, Jane has a physiological problem and has both male and female internal organs (If external, she would already know). This is a VERY RARE condition, and in most people who have it, one or both sex organs are NOT functional. So she couldn't both get pregnant and impregnate.2)Assuming that her male organ worked correctly and was functional (again very illogical and unlikely in her case), she would also have male physical features like facial hair, deeper voice, etc as a teen.3)So she gives birth, and they decide to change her to a man only because she had heavy bleading and they couldn't save her uterus?
Really? That was their solution?
She was bleeding from uterus, not ovaries. And if they removed her uterus, she could still be normal with just ovaries. She just couldn't get pregnant.
Even if they had to remove the ovaries too, they could offer her female HRT (hormone therapy) instead of testosterone. Come on, she's not transgender, she's at it's best just intersex.4)So they realize she has male organs during her labor and when she's under anesthetic drugs? So they see something unique and without sampling or lab tests claim it's a (fully functioning) male organ? What?
And they immediately bring other surgeons in and change her into a man5)Her emotional reaction or shall I say lack of it, is also weird. So she wakes up and they tell her they are changing her into a man ""without her permission"", and she takes it so well without actually being a F2M transgender? And she didn't sue the doctor for that? She didn't get depressed or commit suicide? She didn't ask them to correct this mess? Nothing??!!6)So, she gets pregnant by her male future self, and the baby has no genetic flaws???7)How could she not recognize someone just like her but just with another gender? Didn't she even question they similarity? Cause sex change doesn't change the base of face that much! They could still be able to recognize their extreme similarity.8)How could he (John) fall in lover with himself/herself and in the past? And have sex with her? What?
People rarely fall in love with themselves, besides, even if they do, it's not in a real sexual way. Their attraction was so odd. Also, John knew he's leaving, then why did he date jane? It all happened so fast, when did they have sex to impregnate jane?9)So was the character bisexual? Or was she into men untill she had sex change and then she suddenly got attracted to women?10)So if John takes Jane's baby to the past with time travel, it becomes Jane? That's not how time travel theory works.
Even if you talk about the chicken/egg cycle, the chicken can lay eggs, but cannot become egg itself!!!)11)When John's face got burned in an explosion, how could they manage to change the whole face shape from small squareish round to big and diamond shape face?12)Why would they do such a complicated thing instead of working harder to find the bomber in time?Etc etc.",Predestination

The film stars Ethan Hawke, Sarah Snook and Noah Taylor.I feel like sometimes great movies don't get enough recognition, films like Prisoners, Enemy, or Predestination.
This film impacted me heavily, and it kept me thinking and thinking about it for a week after I saw it. Ethan Hawke gave a great performance, which keeps me wondering why he ever agreed to do ""The Purge"", but the real standout is Sarah Snook, who is breathtaking in her role.One of the best things about this film was that when I thought it was going in one direction, it took a hard right hand turn. Not many movies make me doubt myself like that. The direction was clean and solid, the cinematography was immaculate, and the special and visual effects were outstanding. Everything about the look of the film was perfect.My only complaints are that the movie's first act was a little slow. However, as the film progresses into the second and third act, the long first act is absolutely necessary. If it was a little shorter, it would've worked so well.

Anyone who is into these types of movies would probably have figured out what was going on in the first 15minutes...I have given a 2 star on the pure basis that no film

573,ckaym,Masterpiece!,10,10 January 2015,"According to some this movie has no sense. For some a good movie is one that has meaning, and does make it clear during its storyline, so that at the end you get something new - a feeling, an idea or at least a nice memory. And I agree.A great movie however will make you think about the ideas presented long after it has finished, and Predestination is - no doubt - such a movie!However, it somehow manages to go even beyond that. After spending hours of thinking and researching the ideas in the movie you'll probably find at least one that resonates mostly with your understanding and feelings. And so did I (I also believe I've found THE meaning of the movie, but more about that later). But after reading many comments about the movie, and not so few in-depth analyzes I found out that I'm in a minority with the ideas I've found :) and also found out that there's no majority ... there are so many ideas in it, that when you unravel one it will lead you to more ideas and questions, and where you'll end up, depends mostly on your own thought-process. And I don't mean some different hypothesis about what did the author meant by whatever ... but I mean complete formulated ideas most of which related to the real world!I'm not even sure that the Spierig brothers had the same ideas and conclusions as I did, or - what's more interesting - that the original author /Robert Heinlein/ of the story had. After watching the movie I liked it a lot, but didn't have clear understanding of what happened in it /beside the obvious/. For me the ending was mostly emotional, but I believe that feelings and emotions are just manifests of our unconscious thoughts. However I had a funny accident of a sort. Few years back I've watched a short clip on youtube with Michio Kaku talking about some scientific ideas, so to give and example of what today's physicists are thinking about he told a very short story about a time paradox ... the exact one that the movie tells about. I got really intrigued of how it's possible such a 2-minutes funny-story in a science convention to spark such a movie ... well it didn't take me long to find out that the original story (All you zombies) was written by Robert Heinlein (one of the best sci-fi writers ever) and that both Michio Kaku and the Spierig brothers were simply telling the same story. I read it immediately (it's very short - a dozen pages) and it really opened my mind to new ideas. Not the narrative ones, like a time-paradox, or catching a terrorist, or a sex-changes, but ones about the theory of the mind and the ways we understand and react to the world around.You know how the 'Planet of Apes' raises a question about the difference between us and apes (or more properly if there are such)? Well this story led me to questions like: ""If for many years there have been apes that have learned sign-language, and can solve logical tasks and can answer many questions, why so far no ape have ever asked us a question?"" or ""How people start to consider others' beliefs?"" or ""... where did all you zombies come from?"" ;)Well in both the movie and the original story every word is worth considering and discussing, but I won't spoil it for you. I just wish you to find all these ideas and more!",Predestination
574,zajic815,"Taking ourselves too seriously, are we?",1,4 December 2014,"If you are the kind of person who liked Inception, chances are that you're also going to like this. But if you don't like Nolan's movies in the first place, you're probably not going to like his latest imitators.While writing a brilliant short story ""All You Zombies"", Robert A. Heinlein knew that when working with such a ridiculous premise, like going back in time and having sex with yourself, it is really not possible to try to make the story gritty and serious. This is what the movie does not get. Heinlei's dark humor permeates his short story. But the movie tries hard to appear smart and sophisticated but because of the ridiculous nature of its premise - paradoxical time travel - seems just pretentious and stupid and ultimately fails horribly.Back to the Future is the way to go, a movie that really knows what it wants to do with the mind blowing nature of time travel.",Predestination
575,spable,Dumb,1,21 March 2015,"Sorry. I had to give this movie 1 star of offset all of the praise I'm seeing here. This plot is nonsensical and cheap! Like all reviews here, this one too will contain ***SPOILERS***It's best not to think too much about the logistics of a plot in any time travel movie, but that does not mean that a time travel movie should ask it's viewer to completely turn their brain off. It can be well done, as we've seen in ""Back to the Future"" and ""12 Monkeys"". However the whole point of this movie incorporating time travel is so that one person can go back and kill the person that ruined their life (which alone is not a bad premise) but to then discover they are the very person they wanted to kill and now doing the very act to a younger version of their-self that made them hate this person in the first place? To impregnate their younger self (which they know won't end well) and then grow up to become a time cop on the trail of a bomber (which was the most interesting point of the movie, yet it was the lease explored, and really makes very little sense in the whole way the movie was set up for the first hour). Anyhow, this bomber who's device burns their face which is transplanted. Um, then they go and kidnap the baby spawned by two younger versions of their-self, and then time travel back to the orphanage and leave it to grow up to become them? And now they grow old and become the very bomber they've been hunting? For what reason? If John knew how he made John feel, then why did the have sex with her? Why did he leave her? He had choices to make and could do things differently, but nonsensically did the hurtful things back to her. At the very least stick around and catch the guy the kidnapped your ban!That is all of the ""how"", but this movie give absolutely no ""why"". They can just say ""it's predestination"" and we're supposed to say ""Oh, OK."" What they do give us is some ""chicken or the egg"" crap which could be said about any time travel movie. And the song ""I am my own grandpa"", which, with all shadowy figures to conceal their identity, made the big reveal a big yawn that was seen coming a mile away.Oh- and they were all the same people with very different personalities.The more I think about the movie the more BS it becomes!!!",Predestination
576,marthypeter,I have watched it until the end but it was so predictable...,4,13 December 2014,"I really do approve of IMDb's reviews, not to mention the IMDb's movies ratings and I pretty much steer my judgement based on these ratings, but I believe that this one time I have been deceived.Half of the movie is a story telling and the other half is pretty much obvious based on the story telling. Everything was predictable. I was even hoping to prove myself wrong at some point, but no, the story line was exactly as I have ""predestinated"" it to be.The good part of the movie: the settings for each time period was, I believe, spot on. I was really feeling like living in that period of time. The blend between the past and the future was also interesting and enjoyable, but not enough for a good sci-fi movie.Then again the bad: everything is so unbelievable. If I can swallow the time travel paradoxes as being part of the sci-fi model, I cannot do the same thing for the other parts of the story: why you, rated as a very smart and intelligent person would every share your life story with some bartender? Then again, knowing your past, you deliberately have sex with a younger self, I mean who does that and not feel just a little uncomfortable?The last scene before the ending is also terrible bad, when the ""Fizzle Bomber"" was talking to a younger self, I was really hoping for a much more interesting outcome, like I don't know, killing himself and not the future self?!Next time I will consider my movie options more carefully.",Predestination

Second, if you don't get something or don't like it, don't bash it just ""because""...One person here does not understand basic biology, therefore here it is: John ans Jane can procreate with each other.Another person who heavily criticized the story did not even realized the connection between John and Bartender/Time Agent.YES there are many PARADOXES and many scientific holes and even some discrepancies in the story, BUT is still very enjoyable experience and quite refreshing. It is not as polished Sixth Sense, it has discrepancies all over because is a Sci-Fi movie, it supposed to not make sense at times and even leave us with question marks behind.So, to conclude my humble intervention : HATERS Please Stop Watching Sci-Fi Movies.

You have a suspense even after discovering some new things in the film. It has several layers that are a complete block only after watching till the end of the movie. I also liked an open end that is not confusing and giving you a feeling of a smart script that provide some fuel for thoughts. Overall acting was very impressive so you are fully buying development of the story. This movie will remind Looper, but it has it is own original idea that is Great! I will not tell it here because this is the reason why to see Predestination. The directing is a bit old school and this is exactly what is needed to give a feeling of the past, because the story is happening in XX century.",Predestination
580,christoph-888-579147,One of the most mindblowing time-travel movies in history,10,1 January 2019,"When I watched ""Predestionation"" for the first time, I was like WTF did I just see? Now we show that movie to friends from time to time. And when they ask: ""what is it about?"" - I can only tell them, that it's a movie about time travel. Everything else would be too much to say here.What I love about the movie: it has a very long and quite ""slow"" - I call it - prologue. So in the first hour of the movie, some of the viewers may say: ""hey, that's no time travel movie, it's just some sort of drama"". Yes, that may be true - but just wait for it and watch and listen carefully.
In the second half of the movie, the pace increases. And wow, how it increases. You literally run from one WTF moment to the next. When you get to the first one you think ""aaaah, that's twist here"". And yep, you're right - but wait, there's a lot more.And I think, that is one of the biggest plus in that movie (others don't like that but I really do): in the first half, the viewer is left a bit confused about what he sees and then he just get's this ""aaaaah"" moments on and on. I don't think there is a better scripting to get there than in this movie. At least none that cinephile people does not already know from a lot of other movies.When it came to the acting, I really like Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook. They both play very good and convincing. Somehow I like Snooks role a bit better here, as it is more versatile and complex to play. And she absolutely delivers here.I also like the setting, the coloring, the used thechnique. Some say they like more modern equip and a modern setting. I on the other side really like the idea, that time travel is not invented somewhere in the future, but in the past. And in that case the whole setting is nicely made.One last thing: if you finished the movie, just watch it again and use your knowledge you have now. And you'll laugh when you see all these many winks (some even with the fence post) that lead to the climax. It's all there in the first half of the movie. You just need to see it. So: it's easy to watch this movie several times. Just do it :)",Predestination
581,stephenleung729,Absolutely Mind-Blown,10,3 December 2014,"This movie is no normal sci-fi time traveling movie at all. It is mind-blown to the max level if you are not familiar with this kind of plot twisting movies. It is based on a short story written by Robert A. Heinlein published in 1959, with the title 'All you zombie'. The main difference between the original story and this movie is additional storyline of the fizzle bomber, which I find it brilliant and smart. This is how the movie made you stay focused. With the main character trying to track down the fizzle bomber, you thought this is the main plot of the movie. You thought this is another Hollywood movie about mighty main character doing things to catch the bad guy and save the day. And then you realized you are absolutely wrong. With the eager to find out how Ethan Hawke saves the day and who is the fizzle bomber, the story of how a young orphan grew up was not boring at all. If the movie followed the time line of the original short story, It would not be that intriguing because there would be no lead for the audience to follow during the story telling of Sarah Snook. The whole point of this movie is just about ""a snake that eats its own tail, forever and ever."" So do not bother to find any sort of meanings behind the movie. This is just about how a movie can blow your mind the maximum level. I can only pure genius and I loved it very much.",Predestination

Maybe I'm losing my mind but why would I want to continue writing a review on a movie that makes absolutely no sense and don't try the argument that I'm not intelligent enough or I don't have an open mind.

583,jesserubioiv,My Top 5 Good/Bad on Predestination (Tried To Be Spoiler Free),9,19 June 2015,"Predestination Review:One of my absolute favorite flicks of 2015, the Australian Sci-Fi time travel tale Predestination delivers big on thrills and stories yet falls short in a few key ways that provides for an interesting and downright fun time. So here's my Top 5 Good and Top 5 Bad things about the film.The Good1- Story: based on the short story -All You Zombies- by Robert A. Heinlein the script for this film is an A+. Great twists and total originality give make this an intellectual and super fun view2- Cast: Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook as the Bartender and The Unmarried Mother (respectively) are beyond perfection. In fact they are a pure delight and I can't imagine two better people to portray these characters. This is Hawke's second outing with the Spierig brothers in the writing and directing chairs after Daybreakers (2009)3- Time Travel Conept: This has to be one of my favorite takes on time travel and I really quite enjoy the rules and organization parameters surrounding time travel. Without giving to much away I will say that the concept states that you are only allowed to travel a certain number of years from a designated zero point, which in turn leaves a lot to chew on for the viewer as to the possibilities and limitations of this form of time travel4- Score: with brother Peter Spierig lending the score to this film I felt myself enjoying the film's sounds as much as the movie. The music tells the narrative just as well as the screen does and that I find is the best mark of a film composer. I absolutely adored the very city yet very sophisticated feel of the music and I could more than likely listen to the score on its own and feel just as much gratitude as viewing the film.5- Potential to re-watch: Like any other mind bender Sci-Fi this movie warrants at least two views to grasp all of it (so if you rent it hold onto it for an extra day and watch it again, you'll be glad you did). But I can see myself owning this one in the future. Not only is it super fun but it's a great lender to show your friends not only are you into cool flicks but also intellectual and thought provoking ones.The Bad1- Ignoring basic pre-established principles of time travel: again without giving too much away this film deals a lot with continuum and paradoxes and it does so very well but at the cost of sacrificing some of the crucial principles that pop culture has taught us on the subject of time travel. I can't say more since I'm keeping this review spoiler free but there is a definite oversight of some things we all ""know"" about time travel. Whether or not this was purposeful I don't know but much of it originates in the source material as the movie follows very closely to its source2- Too many shockers: one of the best parts of this story are all the shockers throughout but there are almost too many in this one. Maybe consolidation of a couple would've helped. But essentially of you miss or don't understand one of the big shockers you won't get the rest of the movie which leads me to my next point3- Easy to loose: like Inception or Looper or any other mind warp movie, if you miss 5 min of the movie you might as well not watch it at all. It is definitely one that requires putting down the phone and giving your sole attention to the screen. Most popular movies and blockbusters tell you a back story early on and what the main cannon of the films contains are post backstory. This movie tells you backstory and current film cannon simultaneously, from beginning to end. There's no break in the narrative. Which is fun and yet complex at the same time. So if you have ADHD or are bored with movies easy save yourself a couple of hours and don't bother4- Pace: I enjoy sleeper films and more slow paced indie dramas and melodramatic flicks (don't get me wrong I love popcorn blockbusters too) but this made it easy for me to watch this film. You have to stick with this one cause all though it does grab you with its intense story/narration from the beginning, it can be somewhat slow paced. It picks up in the last act of the film but the first bit isn't very action packed. Which is why you can loose track easily. It can be a tad boring in the beginning causing you to get distracted and thusly you've now lost your place in the film. So again I repeat, PAY ATTENTION and stick with it. It's very rewarding in the end.5- Leaving you in your own paradox: yet again without giving anything away, this film leaves you wanting more but due to source material and paradox of the story it's nearly impossible for anything else. Which in actuality is the genius behind this film. You want more and the only more you'll get is continually re-watching it and believe me it's very worth it.All around Predestination is a great mind warping sci-fi thriller that gives a lot of entertainment and story. Definitely a double watch and make sure to pay attention!",Predestination
584,dshuman-100-128357,Hated it,1,20 December 2015,"I don't know why anyone would like this movie. To make it clear: I love science fiction including time travel films. I have enjoyed 12 Monkeys, Terminator Genisys, Star Trek, and so forth. I began watching Predestination with high expectations, but I was very disappointed. It is the stupidest and most implausible premise I've ever seen. I'm not talking about the parts that are simply weird. I can get past those. It is regarding the characters and their relationships to one another that I have issue with. There is no way that what is revealed could possibly happen. I don't care how many temporal paradoxes are thrown in. I regret the time I spent watching it.",Predestination
585,challam85,Dark alternative time travel flick begging for another watch,8,4 January 2015,"Despite the obvious outcome after the first act, this is an dark and alternative time travel flick that keeps hold of you until the end with its engaging characters and strong performances. A science fiction movie that does not rely heavily on the rules and gimmickry but instead focuses on humanity's predestined nature and self discovery. The trailer and promotions makes this look like a rip roaring roller coaster ride. However, it's heavy in dialogue and the slow cuts leaves you hanging in eerie scenes, much like a Fincher movie. The concept will stay with you for a few days and begs for another watch.",Predestination
586,askaditya619,"Speaking to itself, it takes you through the journey of a paradox",9,8 May 2015,"Starting just like any other movie, it builds up the characters. You're taken through a saga of events which are related later in the plot. It's there in front of you to understand, giving a sense of what's about to come and sure the background score does it's job at keeping you thrilled. Watched the movie for a dose of science fiction but I'm left with a sense of satisfaction around a novel approach to time paradox. Don't know if there's a second part to this but I guess we've to fill the dots in the end. And the chicken/egg question, you're in for an answer here, if you're not satisfied the evolutionary theory. What do you guys think of it?",Predestination
587,bplatt67,Give credit where credit is due.,9,10 October 2021,"My only real criticism is the fact that Robert A. Heinlein is given very little credit for this movie. He wrote the original story, which is better than the movie, but he wrote it, not these other jokers.",Predestination
588,n_godon,More than sci-fi,8,6 October 2019,"A big fan of sci-fi since forever, a good 60-70% of what I watch is sci-fi. But lately, I come across a subgenre of sci-fi ""under the skin"", ""second Earth"", ""I origins"" fall under.
In the tradition of the twilight zone series, Predestination revisit time travel to tackle great human topics such as exclusion, love, being different, reinvent yourself, fate, self-confidence...
Of course, if you came to see 12 monkeys, or Terminator, you might feel betrayed. But if you love Ethan Hawk and give a chance to a slow-paced, well crafted & filmed movie, you will have a amazing experience.
Of course this movie has flaws, as all movies, and that's in part why I gave an 8 stars rating. But this movie successes at what it aims: follow people, document their dream, aspirations, their struggle with life, and the system pushing on them at all time. Great movie.",Predestination
589,chrisetherington23,"A brilliant film, in so many ways.",10,28 November 2014,"I had heard very little of this film prior to viewing, and stumbled upon it by chance. All I had read was the brief description - 'The life of a time-traveling Temporal Agent. On his final assignment, he must pursue the one criminal that has eluded him throughout time.' This was enough for me to decide that I should give it a watch, and while the description was accurate, I had no idea how much more the film had to offer.The characters are complex and intriguing while the actors who play them give great performances and are totally believable. Sarah Snook is a revelation while Ethan Hawke gives a brilliant, assured performance.In some ways this is a simple film led by great acting and strong dialogue, but in other ways it is as complex a film that you are likely to see, with a gripping story and many twists and turns.For me this film has it all. Love, hate, joy, sorrow, romance, drama, action, twists and time travel. I have to admit that this sort of film is right up my street but I truly believe it is nothing short of a masterpiece and I intend to watch it many more times than the twice I already have (the second time being only two days after the first).I would advise anyone to watch this film and hope they enjoy it as much as I have.",Predestination
590,matioa-275-110756,"All good, except the story itself",1,1 December 2014,"Warning, contains all kinds of spoilers!!!This movie could have been good, it could have been great, having in mind that I love Ethan Hawke as an actor. Instead it is utterly rubbish due to the incredible poor story. The writers of the film must have thought - ""How outrageous and WOW could time travel be?"" Well, I don't buy it. I like fantastic movies but this is too much nonsense for me. In the movie we see Ethan Hawk taking different forms in time (beeing a woman until his 20s and becoming a man after that, time traveling in order the later Ethan Hawke to meet the younger woman Ethan Hawke, to fall in love in her(himself), to make love with her (himself) and guess what - make her (himself, remember) pregnant. After that for not known to us reason the later Ethan Hawke kidnaps the child and takes it back in time (it turns out that the child is himself actually). So lets recap - Ethan Hawke creates himself by f...ng himself and loves only himself? What a pile of horse..it!The main idea behind the film actually come from the saying - what is the first, the egg or the chicken - well in the film it turns out that it is neither. It is the rooster, the late MAN Ethan Hawke.",Predestination
591,moriarties,Impressive through its performances,7,2 April 2015,"Like many others, I watched Predestination without having any idea what it was about, except for the fact that it starred Ethan Hawke with a mustache. I'd recommend that anyone who wants to give it a try does the same: not seeing any video material or reading the plot online truly enriches the experience. This movie was an outstanding mystery/science-fiction surprise and it will remain one of the highlights of 2015 for me.The plot, while somewhat dazzling, is gripping and not too difficult to follow. The only problem lies in the pacing, since the second act seems to belong to a different movie entirely and I can see why some people might have lost their patience during the first 30-40 minutes. That wasn't the case for me. Personally, I loved all the preparation that was done at the beginning and even though I was caught off guard when the direction shifted, I felt like it worked. Admittedly, there are plot holes and things that don't add up – but the overall picture is that the story is intriguing and worth speculating about.The cinematography is clean and helps build a sense of visual symmetry. Aesthetically, my favorite scenes were the ones in the bar where the lightning and the colors are simply breathtaking to look at. The special effects are good, but not spectacular. The soundtrack, however, is remarkable and I kept coming back to it long after I watched the movie.All technical details aside, what stands out about Predestination is the acting. Ethan Hawke is convincing and calculated in his performance, but the one that truly shines is Sarah Snook. Her portrayal blew my mind away and it felt like she was the real star of the movie instead of Hawke. About 80% of the reason why I can't get Predestination out of my head is what Sarah Snook was able to do with this role, completely transforming herself on screen and delivering one of the most intriguing and fascinating characters I've seen recently. I bow down to this young woman's acting potential and I hope we get to see a lot more of her work in the future.I was thoroughly impressed by Predestination and I sincerely hope that it won't just fade away as a simple piece of entertainment. Yes, it can feel commercial at times, but in the end, it's definitely worth checking out – especially for the performances.",Predestination

You go back in time to meet your former self, you were once a woman, but now a fertile male, and you convince your younger male self to go back in time to impregnate your former female self with a baby that ends up being kidnapped and placed at the steps of an orphanage - and then we discover that the baby is the female to male to you genesis - 
This is impossible as matter does not appear - the baby needed to come from somewhere other than itself - 
The idea of the chicken or egg coming first or the snake eating its own tail (Ouroboros) plays a major part in the theme, but - the chicken, the egg and the snake, cannot come from nowhere and create itself - 
This was the only glaring plot hole that bothered me - other than a 52 minute exposition flashback which was frustrating as I kept hoping they'd get the bomber before he...oh, wait, yeah, the bomber was at a bar talking to himself about his former self when he...she got pregnant by himself and the baby was stolen and became him - 
I like a true psychological thriller - and this one missed a major plot-point which ruins the ideology and message -",Predestination

It definitely deserves a better recognition. I always thought that original Heinlein's story was incredibly difficult for screen adaptation due to its shortness and solid narrative structure. Besides it's so difficult to make certain scenes to look believable on screen. And Spierig's brothers did their job surprisingly well. Small additions to the story made it more complex, focused and accomplished. Sarah Snook was amazing and Ethan Hawke was great as her supportive.

603,adamrussell2,Disappointing,7,14 February 2015,"OK, so i first heard about this film in an article about 'mind bending' films. As i am a massive fan of films that test your brain whilst you watch them, i figured i would add this film to my watch list. From all the reviews and internet hype about this film i was expecting something along the lines of inception but time travel instead of dreams. I had been informed that i was in for a brilliant twist ending that changed the whole concept of the film. So i set out to watch this much anticipated sci-fi thriller. My disappointment started right from the start as i realised that the mind bending twist was easily explained throughout the film with a rather excessive trail of breadcrumbs. If you didn't see the ending coming, you hadn't been watching the film. As i saw it, there were two 'twists'. The first being that Sarah Snook's character and Ethan Hawke's character were one and the same. This moment came for me when the bomb disarming explosion happened and despite a relatively good effort by the makeup team to cover her face, Sarah Snook was clearly the burn victim who's face was reconstructed into Ethan Hawke's face. This was interesting at the time but not much of a twist. What i couldn't understand was that the creators of the film seemed to believe that i hadn't realised this even at the end of the film and they decided to do a big montage style reveal showing that they were the same person! It wasn't very hard to work out! The second 'twist' that Jane/John was the bomber was also extremely obvious thanks to multiple clues throughout the film. I was expecting the ending to depict John/Jane realising this fact and somehow breaking the never-ending loop. What the film actually depicted was that The loop was unbreakable. To conclude, good basis but if you are going to do a massive twist at the end of your film, don't leave so many easy clues that ruin it.",Predestination
604,vanillathesloth,Close but no cigar,6,14 September 2015,"I watched the film not knowing what to expect, and as the film progressed I became increasingly excited with the classic time travel plot line and Nolanesque storytelling. The first thing I noticed was how personal it was – the focus is directed on the characters from the first moment. The film took me on a journey of suspense and mystery as it laid out the plot, but soon problems arose. The film played it's cards to early. Perhaps having seen similar movies (quite possibly inspired by the story on which this film was based) did not help, but I had completely figured out the plot from the beginning of the third act. The remainder of the film, although stunningly well directed and shot, with effective music (kudos to the composer for the triple role in this film), seemed slightly comical, each ""twist"" melodramatically thrown in my face. In fact, my watching experience was strangely similar to the plot itself – I'd seen it all before. I knew what was coming. Like the joke the barman tells the Unmarried Mother, I already knew the punchline. And perhaps it is just from my personal watching experience that I was able to so easily predict the outcome (it does look like it caught some people judging by the other reviews), but it does seem like the film gives a lot away. The pieces were so easy to put together – the similarities between the barman and his customer, the repeated use of the cosmetic surgery plot device, the missing baby – it all came together for me with 40 minutes to spare, for me to watch it all play out exactly as I expected. The writers attempt to cover up this issue by hinting that the bartender may have some kind of mental instability; however he and Robertson look like they have an understanding of the situation when they are in discussion, and surely he notices his scars and knows who he is. Besides, I don't have dementia and psychosis so I still knew what was going on. (Also, despite claiming to not know that he was the fizzler bomber, the bartender still tells the Unmarried Mother that has a feeling that the man he is meeting the is the fizzler bomber when he sends him back to meet himself.)This predictability (or ""predestination"") of the plot could be part of a larger pacing issue wherein the twist at the end lasted for an entire third act. The first half of the movie feels like the setup it is for a more complicated plot; that segment of the movie perhaps also should have been condensed. And maybe the fact that two sections of the movie lasted far too long is just an indicator that the short story was simply too short to be made into a film. None of this is to say I didn't enjoy it. Predestination is a brilliant piece of work and the central concept of the hermaphrodite giving birth to his/herself in an infinite time paradox is very original, albeit slightly flawed. On a side note, it was also slightly sexist that a woman should better than her peers (""elite"") simply because she was half man; however, this didn't detract from the experience and I'm sure it wasn't intentional. Other than it's serious pacing issues, I would have given the film 8 out of 10. Close but no cigar.",Predestination

608,cashton-859-438869,A unique and decidedly dark sci-fi film,8,19 September 2014,"""Predestination"" is an incredibly original and creative film, employing what may seem like 'common' aspects of the science-fiction genre, and putting a darker, grimmer twist on them. Time travel is handled quite well in this Australian film, focusing less on the effects of travelling back (and forth) in time than other sci-fi films. ""Predestination"" uses decidedly odd pacing, beginning with a 'bang' and following that up with almost an hour of subdued plot. But oddly enough, these moments of -almost- pure dialogue and occasional flashbacks never become boring, but rather deepen the film's characters and their back-stories. The cast performances are what really make this movie 'shine'. Ethan Hawke, as usual, delivers an almost flawless performance as the unnamed lead, and Sarah Snook, an Australian newcomer, surprises with her wide range of acting abilities. Overall, the third feature film by the Spierig Brothers is a surprisingly original, daring, and genre-bending film.",Predestination

Ethan Hawke gave a great performance, which keeps me wondering why he ever agreed to do ""The Purge"", but the real standout is Sarah Snook, who is breathtaking in her role.One of the best things about this film was that when I thought it was going in one direction, it took a hard right hand turn. Not many movies make me doubt myself like that. The direction was clean and solid, the cinematography was immaculate, and the special and visual effects were outstanding. Everything about the look of the film was perfect.My only complaints are that the movie's first act was a little slow. However, as the film progresses into the second and third act, the long first act is absolutely necessary. If it was a little shorter, it would've worked so well. Confusing? Yes. Enjoyable? Big time.

You'll really enjoy the movie.Ethan Hawke plays a person that is a time travel agent that tried to prevent time travel related crimes. As with most all time travel movies a paradox occurs and it is up to him to fix the paradox. He has to save lives from a bomb made by the Fizzle Bomber that is set to go of and kill thousands of people causing problems for that time agency.Just when you think you know what is going to happen a new layer of the paradox is slowly revealed. But, the movie will lead you on and keep you on the edge of you seat, because, this Predestination Paradox is like an onion. Just when one layer is pealed back, right around the corner several more layers of the paradox are waiting to be revealed.You'll end up loving this movie and because of the way they edit and let time unfold as the story is told, you'll want to watch the movie again just to see it with the hindsight of having seen it the first time as you hope to catch little things that are right there for you to figure out about the storyline.Once you watch it, you'll know why you'll NEED to watch it again.

This makes the movie long in parts as it works on its building of clues, but most viewers will have guessed the ending well before the finish. All the cast put in convincing performances, with Snook stealing the show in what is essentially a three actor movie. Some back-story items are interesting- particularly the training of in-flight courtesans for the all-male astronauts - but other parts look more like fillers.

The cinema release should have been huge and Hawke & the female lead hit home runs. without giving too much away it starts in a bar where an undercover time agent searching for a terrorist (Hawke) befriends a bitter the guy in a bar. the man is a post op trans-gender who tells him a story of how she was abandoned at an orphanage as a child, raised in care, then selected for a secret astronaut program (all shown in flashbacks which look more like Spetsnaz training) only to be booted out after a fight with an other girl.After leaving the program she meets a guy, falls in love and falls pregnant. The baby is stolen & she finds out to her horror that she is a hermaphrodite. It's some story but Hawke's got one better....This film will challenge you, wrong foot you and make you think, almost entirely throughout. Even the big reveals which are spoon fed well in advance (so you can pat yourself on the back at your cleverness in predicting them) are sneakier than you might think. think quantum leap crossed with the butterfly effect if Sam had a had serious narcissistic tendencies and a sex change.

623,frankmannboccaccio,jinn: a demon or angel appearing as a whirl of wind,8,25 November 2014,"Read the following at your risk, if you haven't seen the movie yet. One of the virtues of this piece is that you fall for every surprise the plot hides, simply because you are engrossed in the action, except the last one, maybe, there you may come prepared. Predestination is about time travel, and the insoluble paradox it offers. I have read on the board long arguments in the quest of a consistent time travel theory. I find it a futile exercise, the meaning of this movie lies elsewhere. One of the common paradoxes of time travel is "" what happens if you go back in time and kill your father?"". Trivial. But what if you are at the same time father and mother and son, by jumping the time line after a change of sex and loving the previously female yourself?. And much more. It may seem be a ludicrous plot, were it not so well developed, so you don't notice for a long while; it is simply brazen and for this it deserves respect. And when you notice, this ""creature"". born like a jinn from a whirl in the wind of time, doing it all, end and beginning, by itself, herself, himself, with no ancestors nor descendants, has already caught on you, in its lonely descent from good into evil, a fascinating sad example of the human condition. The vintage atmosphere, the slight resemblance of a version of the main character with young Leonardo Di Caprio, all helps to weigh anchor in the sea of time, not thinking of all the paradoxes, and enjoying the ride.

That's where the mind***k element comes in.In a nutshell, this is a commendable effort by The Spierig Brothers. After all in terms of production, you can't compare Predestination's US$17 million budget to the US$165 million of Interstellar. But as far as storyline, screenplay and concept are concerned, I find Predestination to be more enticing and thought provoking than Nolan's space epic.After all, Predestination is a science FICTION flick. It's a fiction. Nobody questioned how everyone on Dune can speak perfect English anyway. Why rationalize and try to apply so-called 'scientific' theories to the movie? Just grab a bucket of popcorn, sit back and get mind blown",Predestination

The movie makes you think which is rare these days...Time traveling is always interesting. Bross Willis also touched the same issues in Looper movie - but if there it was more an action movie, here the action is not the main thing. it has a fast pace and the movie goes with you after it is finished. I haven't figured out yet the complicated philosophy given by the movie and it it is actually possible. Go see it - you won't be disappointed. Its a combination of film noir, drama and sci-fi - all in one movie. And Offcourse how can I forget Eitan Hawk? I would go see the movie even only for him...:).",Predestination

631,yaniv-gershfield,Utter Nonsense,1,12 December 2014,So I've been using IMDb for years to get reviews and ratings without ever contributing. IMDb is generally spot on with it's ratings. This is the first time that I felt it was wrong. The ratings for this film are absurdly high. I felt I needed to write this review to bring some balance. It's almost as though the producers got 100 people to review this.This film is utter nonsense. It has attempted to introduce a paradox that is no paradox as it could never happen even given the most ridiculous assumptions that the film makes. It's just a silly silly film trying to be clever. I would probably have given it 3 out of 10 had it not been for the absurdly high average it has (at the time of writing 7.2 with 165 reviews).I have watched many rubbish films and have managed to take something away from them as a learning experience. This is the first time that I literally felt that I had actually wasted just under 2 hours of my life.Do yourself a favour and give this rubbish a wide berth.,Predestination
632,michaelq-billinghurst,Sweet Jesus! I paid for this twice,1,5 January 2015,"Good gravy I shoulda known. Being a fan of Zombie films I watched Undead. Hated it. Being partial to the odd Vampire flick I watched Daybreakers. Hated it. Why? Second-rate Australian genre films funded by the Government (i.e. the poor old taxpayers of Australia) and made by people who can write a good briefing note for funding but can't write a decent script for a feature film.So why oh why did I shell out for Predestination (on Blu-Ray no less) made by the same ham-fisted, no-talent losers? Well, time-travel movies are my absolute fave, what with the potential for great storytelling and everything.And this is where this polished turd of a film falls flat: Sure it looks good, it's got a big actual Hollywood Star in it Ethan Hawke off Gattaca; It even has the ever wonderful Sarah Snooks - doing her best with what she's got. But this movie flags its every move with the kind of 'WATCH THIS!' flourish that, if you've ever seen another actual movie, will make you wonder if the Directors and Producers ever have. (Hey, what about if we just keep a bunch of faces hidden throughout the film?).And if so, could they perhaps think of a slightly better way of telling this not-at-all-convoluted time-travel paradox that can be guessed with almost the entire film left to go? If you want to enjoy a good time travel film there are plenty to choose from, but why not go with Looper (but really, I would recommend Primer).While the filmmakers are trying hard, they display no real talent for film-making and if they were doing it where films were a real industry, rather that a tax-payer subsidised government run hopeless festival, they would be laughed out of town for this shizzle.As for Mr Hawke, thank God for Mr Linklater.",Predestination

The film cues those issues. *** SPOILER *** Everything happens (back in time, become pregnant Jane, delivery the baby) was for the character of Ethan Hawke have more chance to get the ""Fizzle Bomber"" because the agency was home to retire. The only way to have another chance was to make the young Jane last live all that suffering to become the best time agent (Ethan Hawke), cause he also went through it. That is, this is his destiny, it is ideally suited. I can even see a certain message in this film: We all need goals to be able to run after.

The trailer is nothing like the film. This film has little emotional depth, little character development, horrible acting, and is a horrible script adaptation overall. I can see how it would succeed if executed well, but it has a lot of things working against it. For one, the acting is horrible, although, the script and extremely small cast (3 basically) is not helping the actors do their job. The biggest problem of all, however, is that the entire film is based on a really quite superficial script. Without spoiling anything, the script is basically just a story which tries to confuse and deceive your mind and then give you a clever twist at the end that fits all the pieces of the puzzle together. What it ends up being as a film is something that feels like a few high school kids got together after watching Inception and made a film about time travel. I say this because the film is really just a perplexing script, a story about a time travel puzzle, but it is mediocre in most other areas. I will say that the cinematography (mostly) and sound are very good, but there are obvious editing and acting problems, which make the film feel like an amateur attempt. This, with the shallow script focused singularly on a complex twist to end with that ignores completely larger social or philosophical messages which could have been mentioned, (hope you won't have to find out what they are) creates a boring and cringe-inducing amateur sci-fi film with a multi-million dollar budget thrown out the window.",Predestination

I was mesmerized, my mind so deep in the story and my eyes glued to the screen, from the beginning of the film until the credits.Sadly this movie may not have had the success it deserves.

637,soeren-b-vistisen,More than just plot devices and twists,10,31 January 2015,"Well that didn't take long... A few weeks into the year, and i might already have found my favorite movie of the year! This is an amazing Little gem of a movie. Lots of people will probably just say: laaaaame, i predicted all the twists. But the great thing about this movie is, that it's not just about the twists. This movie has an incredibly strong undercurrent of emotion. I would definitely have cried a lot more the first time around, had i not been as confused about what's going on... Sarah Snooke's performance is truly incredible., filled with raw emotion, and true pain, in what she has to go through. The first time i watched this movie,i didn't notice how brilliant Hawke's performance was. Because of one major twist, which i could never even consider spoiling, you have to Watch the movie twice, to notice why his performance is brilliant. Now about the twists: i did indeed predict a few of them. That didn't make them any less mind blowing (must invent other not overused Word for this) to me. Just thinking about this movie blows my mind (last use of the word, i swear!) And a lot of the other ones really did take me by surprise. But at the end of the day, it's the emotional and intellectual implications of them, that truly make this movie special. Having said that, this movie isn't perfect. One special effect at the beginning is nearly laughable, and the soundtrack occasionally feels like ""standard sci-fi mix volume 1"". But the truth is, that this movie has stayed with me in ways i can't describe. Maybe it's the twists, maybe the themes but most likely the incredible performances. The kinds that the Oscars just don't recognize. Oh, and the way the time travel looks and sounds is hella cool. Aaaand the make-up is amazing.",Predestination
638,gabaldovin,"On the contemporary society neurosis repression cycle noticed in the movie ""Predestination""",9,1 February 2015,"( I made a longer review of this film but unfortunately the text is longer than 1 000 words that is accepted here. A web address also cannot be placed. But the longer version of this review can be very easily find on Google by looking after the keywords ""Gabriel Baldovin"" and ""Predestination"" ) This film theme is a combination of elements from psychology, philosophy and physics related to time travel fiction. As a SF author, Robert A. Heinlein was not mainly interested by psychopathology or psychology and, of course, nor Spierig brothers, who developed his short story into a 90 min movie. None of them have solid psychology studies, although they are not experts in philosophy and physics neither. The psychological side of the story is treated from the author perspective, who observes and notices, but from the observer one, who copies its own mind symptoms. But if the story had been forced to overlap on some psycho-pathological models, the film would have been even richer in meanings.The psychological side of the film I think the concrete reality of romantic love paradigm has a very important role in strengthening this film's symbol: we fall in love after a miraculous meeting, then we make mercantile compromises, then we lose love, then we come to hate the previously loved partner, and then die. This is the cycle of life, the Jung's mandala word-for-word described in the film in this sentence: ""The snake that eats its own tail, forever and ever. "" Another very interesting track analysis is the neurotic police repression. By punishing criminals on and on, the society gets into a repression vicious circle that continuously creates criminals, without in-depth solving the crime problem root, just like the neurotic patient itself does with its individual symptoms. The temporal agent goes back in time due to a police repressive impulse to prevent the crimes made by the ""Fizzle Bomber"". But time traveling makes him himself sick also, so that he will become another ""Fizzle Bomber"". The war on terror is itself a terror. The ""Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder"" syndrome, found in the American soldiers who commit suicide then after getting back home from wars, is the expression of this psycho-social reality. We take for granted that the police and the army protect us from criminals and terrorists but, in their haste repressive craziness for a patriarchal justice, we fall ourselves into their victims. The aggression, no matter how (apparently) justified, against someone else eventually returns, sooner or later, against us. ""The snake that eats its own tail, forever and ever. "" So, for me, the analysis core of this particular movie is the fact that its producers are (mono zygotic) twins. I think we can start a genuine psychoanalysis from here on this film, as autobiographical one. The two brothers had always have the meeting with oneself through the other one, they loved each other, they argued one another, they split one into another and had rivalries. They might have loved each other more than they loved themselves, individually, taking the well-known Christianity sentence into an unimaginable fictional absurdity. The Oedipal triad became a quartet in their case. It should be also mentioned that they were German immigrants, so they must have or have had experienced the immigrant's typical anxieties. The fact that this ""Fizzle Bomber"" has a central role in this movie can be explained by the resentment that immigrants generally have towards the world. The percentage of antisocial behavior among immigrants or their descendants is much higher than that of the native population. These fears were multiplied with the terrible Australian snakes and spiders threats (unlike the European ones).The literal killing of ""Fizzle Bomber"" is a way to suppress this revenge that, as immigrants and socially marginalized, they want to point over the world. Returning in time and becoming ""better"" than the vengeful terrorist is a metaphor of civilization, of calming down the primitive warlike impulses and cultivating the values of forgiveness and tolerance towards others. This wisdom way is common to the natural course of warring communities, or to the individual enemies that eventually reconcile each other, but also to someone's individual personal development. The revenge is sweet at the moment, but it can bring long-term burden into soul; the avenger super-ego will eventually end up in questioning whether the ""punishment"" applied in the past to someone for correction was too high, becoming itself guilty and seeking punishment for cleaning this burden off of its mind.Another trail for genuine psychoanalysis concerns their identical twins destiny who threatens one another their deep narcissism: if there is someone identical to me, then it means that I am not the best and only one as there is another one who is least my equal. From here these themes can be developed in relation to the analysis material. Since do not have it at the moment, I stop here.Bad sides The film is an exceptional one because the theme is an exceptional one. But it could have been much better if it would not have some negative things. I wrote a section of 14 bad points that cannot fit in 1000 words limit of this site.

The storyline is absolutely ridiculous and there's a difference between originality and just plain horse poo. I can't believe that someone thought this would make a good film,it's full of plot holes and just crap. The storyline is boring at the beginning, there's a five minute gap where you think it's about to get good. It then turns into a horrendous film.

640,jamoecw-238-671946,predestination - chicken or the egg with time travel involved,3,12 February 2015,"So first off when you see the movie you at least know the title, Predestination. Predestination means something which is destined to happen based on some prior event or events. In the first scene you see someone with advanced technology during a time period that wouldn't support such, and if you read the synopsis on the back then you know about the time travel. So the guy with advanced tech is a time traveler, or an alien, or some sort of super genius ahead of his time. there is someone in the room with him, but you only get very brief glimpses, which results in the advanced tech guy getting distracted and defeated. In his pain a figure steps out and helps him, given that the only person in the room from what we can tell is the bad guy, this is perplexing. Given such an act either the bad guy isn't really bad, or he has an ulterior purpose. Now given the time traveler theory from earlier (or if you read the synopsis) then you can surmise that the bad guy is the good guy, as it is a classic and prolific time traveler twist. Shortly afterwords the movie gives away that he is a time traveler. Shortly after that we get a new plot thread, one of an orphan (in fantasy and scifi this is often the special chosen one) which then has a certain unstated medical condition. Now the story is being told by a man, and the orphan is a girl, which he states is himself/herself when he starts the story. Now since we know of standard time travel clichés, and they already used the biggest one, we should suspect that the child is its own parent, and given the gender bending one can suspect both parents. As the story unfolds it becomes clearer that both clichés are used and in fact are intertwined, which given that the title is Predestination and time travel is involved is not a surprise in the slightest. The other elements in the story are essentially nonexistent, which gives to rise the question as who set the paradox into motion and how (you know the real intellectual question about a time travel paradox). That question isn't answered to any real degree, other than to show that someone probably did in fact set it in motion. After you figure out the plot twists (really basic ones at that) they continue to hammer in the twists for those that somehow haven't figured it out, until the movie ends. There isn't anything else to the movie at all. I can't give it a 1 due to the acting being good, and there aren't any major glitches, it is a well made time travel movie, except for the story (in every respect) with nothing else to help it along.",Predestination

It's like the drunk uncle at the family gathering that won't shut up nor let you go. After all this, the second half is so predictable it's painful. Also confusing as all hell. They're trying to sell you, that he (she?) fathered himself, taken the baby back in time, just to start the cycle again? FAIL! The ONLY thing that would really redeem the movie, would been that instead of killing the old self at the end, John (Jane..) should've shot himself and end the cycle.

The ending is completely impossible. The old which came first the chicken or the egg question. I wish I would have fallen asleep about 5 minutes before it ended and never finished watching it.

645,leomigraso,Might be the greatest time travel movie of all time,10,16 May 2015,"The Spierig brothers' Predestination isn't easy to categorize, straddling the genres of time travel, action-thriller, poignant character study, detective yarn and survival story.Intelligent and thought-provoking, the film works effectively on most levels despite numerous and occasionally confusing leaps in logic and eras, thanks to the guile of the filmmakers, a stand-out performance by Sarah Snook and an impressive turn by the usually dependable Ethan Hawke.Sony Pictures Worldwide Acquisitions pure-bought domestic and some international rights to the Melbourne-lensed pix which had its world premiere at SXSW in March. Predestination looks likely to appeal to fans of the time-traveling genre and, more broadly, mainstream moviegoers who can relate to the themes of identity, loss, fate and righting wrongs.It's the Spierig twins' second collaboration with Hawke following Daybreakers, a 2009 horror movie which grossed $US30 million in the US, released by Lionsgate, and more than $50 million worldwide. The German-born brothers made their debut in 2003 with zombie comedy/horror Undead.The promising prologue is narrated by Hawke, who explains he works for an agency which prevents crimes before they happen. He's the guy in a trench coat and fedora who tries desperately to disarm an explosive device rigged by a terrorist dubbed by the media as the ""Fizzle Bomber"" in 1970s New York.There is a shoot-out with the bad guy, the bomb explodes, the agent is horribly burnt but he recovers and has a complete facial reconstruction, the first of several trans-formative experiences.Year later, Hawke's unnamed character is tending a bar in New York when he meets an androgynous-looking patron (Snook) with short- cropped hair and a low, gruff voice, who says his name is John. With little prompting John says he writes a ""true-confessions"" column in a pulp magazine under the pseudonym The Unmarried Mother.It's soon revealed that John was born Jane, an orphan in Cleveland, and later joined the Space Corp. as an aspiring astronaut. In an extended flashback Jane relates her tragic experiences, in part involving a mysterious authority figure named Mr. Robertson (adroitly played by Noah Taylor). To divulge more of the elaborate plot inspired by Robert A. Heinlein's short story ""All You Zombies"" would veer into spoiler territory; suffice to say Hawke's character offers to help John/Jane hurtle back through time to try to right a serious wrong.Snook is a revelation in the dual roles as the cynical and embittered John, and as the young Jane, a misfit who is initially unloved and isolated before developing a physical and mentally toughness in the face of adversity. The Aussie actress, who graduated from the National Institute of Dramatic Art in 2008, made her film debut in Rom-com Not Suitable for Children in 2010. That was followed by Zak Hilditch's apocalyptic thriller These Final Hours (acquired domestically by Well Go USA) and Lionsgate's horror/thriller Jessabelle. Her star quality stamps her as a talent to watch. Hawke is a highly effective foil, initially as a sympathetic listener before he too transforms into a very different and nuanced character. Taylor brings a real presence to the enigmatic Mr Robertson.For a story arc that spans the 1940s to 1993, Mathew Putland's production design, Wendy Cork's costumes and visual effects expertly evoke each decade. Ben Nott's inventive cinematography and Peter Spierig's subtle, atmospheric score enhance the experience of watching an ambitious film that is never less than intriguing, if not always plausible.",Predestination

The viewer may not know that in the beginning so it is possible that he/she might not even understand it but the ultimate kick the movie's climax gives will make him/her watch it again. Ethan Hawke, at his best, stars as the Temporal Agent, a time traveller who is on a mission to stop this ""Fizzie Bomber"" from killing thousands of people.

She plays a male character, and a female one too! Whatever sex she is in, she has done it almost flawlessly. ""The Unmarried Mother"" is actually an inter-sex creature who is forced to turn into a man after giving birth under some circumstances which involve a 1960 Government Space Experiment.

Without the baby Jane never exists. You must see how this cycle is impossible, yes? She would need to have been plucked from a different family and moved to a different time. But then give birth to a child and have her organs removed becoming a man. Then he would have to go back in time and intercept herself from said previous relationship to literally create herself (and part of the reason she fell for him is because of their cute meet and the line he quoted). Which isn't how pregnancy works, because there's just too many genes and cells to recreate your own self. Well acted, and it creates a lot of good questions about John's boss.

651,thekingstar,just in case spoiler,7,24 December 2015,"Mike McCahill @ telegraph Considering these characters are bounced round like pinball's, it's amazing Hawke and the hitherto unknown Snook gain the emotional traction they do: even those struggling to keep up can't fail to notice how these two are burnt, figuratively and literally, by their experiences. Future viewings will be required and merited, for towards the center of this mazy gem there lies a radical narrative proposal of which the boundary-testing Wachowski siblings would doubtless approve: that the roles of knight in shining Armour and damsel in distress may be entirely interchangeable. i'm seeing it this way:He is a secret agentHe Is HIs FatherHe Is HIs Motherand he is the Son from himself father and motherThe problem that made the movie fail is the chicken came first or the egg,unlike ""Inception"" movie which had a beginning and end , but the end of it is the mystery is it true or not butin Predestination the beginning and end of the film based on the presence of non-existent, what comes first to the other chicken or the egg",Predestination

654,mahyarfateh-64975,I know where I came from - but where did all you zombies come from?,8,23 July 2021,"First thing that grabs my attention in this movie is the magnificent and deep performance of Ethan Hawke and Sarah Snook, along with the elegant classic atmosphere that has been well-polished and settled delicately.I divide the whole thing in two main chapters, first the one in which a stranger is telling his life story inside a bar to the bartender, although there is nothing supernatural in this story but you can feel there are yawning logical gaps inside it, the story keeps you amused and thirsty and as a result you would not feel the time passing by,
As the bartender gives out the stranger his reward -for the gamble they took earlier- in a generous manner, meaning he is not totally impressed with such a dramatic tale, he starts acting strange and makes confusing statements. Boom, there it comes the temporal second chapter I was waiting for, main characters slide through time using a strange, small sized time travelling machine and go on a mysterious journey.Spierig brothers have done perfect job building an artwork so easy to comprehend, in a way that leaves almost no question marks at the bottom line for a typical viewer, although it keeps challenging your mind, you can see that nothing is bothering you about the script in the end and that's what I like about predestination. It has served well as an entertaining movie which has new things to say in a genre that has already been addressed extensively. My score for predestination is something between 7 and 8 but I rather keep having a more positive view over it and give it an 8.",Predestination

656,olivajordan,Best Time-Travelling Concept In Movies...,10,5 October 2016,"The moment I decided to watch this movie I didn't expect it would become one of my favorite movies, though I admire Ethan Hawke's role- taking. First, I expected it's just a low-budget movie with plain cinematography and plot but I was wrong. This is the kind of movie that I won't let my family and friends to miss --especially if they are into science and intellectual genre. I've loved the acting, the theme, the scenes' transition, and the reality-concept --it all just went perfect to my taste in movies. Moreover, I've never been this so eager to make a movie review. I guess this film motivated me to do so. So, if you know your good enough to be mind-blown with an awesome story, you've got to see this too.",Predestination
657,alvision,"Too many prematurely given hints, including its title",7,29 October 2020,"The main twists in the plot were both hinted in the narrative too early, well before the final revelation, making them unsatisfying for those who wanted some unexpected surprises in this kind of film.Spoiler AlertWhat's most unexpected for me was how the first half of the film was all about someone telling his/her past in a bar, when I expected some more time traveling and this agent outsmarting or being outsmarted by the bomber, but all we get is two guys chatting in the bar.",Predestination
658,davis-75765,"This is an overlooked, wonderful gem of a movie.",10,16 November 2017,"I read the short story this is based on as a kid about 40 years ago 'All You Zombies', I was blown away. When I was rereading it I looked up some facts on it at WikiP. I was surprised to see a movie had been made based on it. Amazon had it with their Prime Service so I watched it right away.This is one good movie! It remains quite faithful to the book, even down to many of the dialog lines pulled directly from it. It's well done, well shot and very entertaining to watch. Sarah Snook is absolutely amazing.***SPOILERS AHEAD ***Sarah Snook places the main character as a young woman Jane, then again after her sex change as John. While you can tell there is something effeminate looking about Young John, Snook does an amazing job of acting like a man, from gestures to postures, she does a completely convincing acting job of making you believe she really is a man. In one scene she plays both parts in the same scene sitting across a table from each other (watch the movie or read the story to find out how) and the difference is amazing. The mannerisms are there and the bearing is all there. She IS a woman one one side of the screen and is a man on the other side.Some liberties were taken with the story line here and there but does a great job of sticking to the story as written. Another twist about the Elder John being the villain is added to fill out the story and really does add something extra to the movie. Had the author of the story thought of it I am sure he would have done it too.There is also a minor change about the young John having a face transplant due to a major burn injury and Middle John is therefore played by a different actor. I imagine this was to keep the audience from knowing the truth of the characters identity and also so that Sarah Snook would not have to play all 4 characters. That would be a MAJOR feat and effort on her part and I doubt even with makeup that she could have pulled it off.It's a great watch!",Predestination
659,siddharthp-79113,Absolutely brilliant and intelligent movie.Very underrated.,10,16 January 2017,"This is not just classic sci-fi it is almost a classic Greek play: Fateful and tragic. That's the parting feeling. But it delivers so many genres on any level you care to enjoy it. To me the strength of this film is the characters—every day people like ourselves—seeing themselves in an extraordinary light. As time-travel stories go there are none of the paradoxes of other such films to frustrate you. The elegant, thought-provoking symmetry of the original short story is respected beautifully—but hats off to the directors for expanding it into a study of human self-identity. In my opinion the best sci-fi only uses fantasy (within the realms of possibility) to explore humanity in ways that a grounding in known reality cannot, and this film offers viewers a 'what if' so believably presented they can put themselves in that situation and question themselves in a way they normally never would. The only paradox here is the very real inescapable self of all of us and yet being so many different people throughout our lives. You will benefit from seeing this film.",Predestination
660,mauricerichard,"Very obvious plot, lack of an interesting story",1,20 March 2017,"I got recommended to watch this as I like plot twists, but I got hugely disappointed. At min 40 the entire plot was already obvious. You don't have to be a time-travel movie expert to figure it out and the characters/story isn't that interesting. I guess what they do wrong is that there are no side-stories that can suddenly catch you off-guard.Only spend time on this movie if you really really like anything with time travel and don't care for an interesting plot(twist). But then first watch any other time travel movie that you can find on IMDb.",Predestination

662,msulluoglu-73411,Not for discerning viewers,5,1 September 2021,"Most of this film rings hollow, with even basic questions about the plot and character motivations glossed over. What was the Fizzle Bomber's motivation for killing 10000 people in 1975 New York? Given that he was a law enforcement agent gone rogue, what crime was he trying to prevent? How did the temporal agent become the Fizzle Bomber? What was the driving force in that transformation? Jane was quite a pretty lady, enough to be considered for a job as a sexual partner for male astronauts, so how can we take her insecurity over her appearance seriously? Why did John agree to impregnate Jane, knowing the pain it would cause her? Why did he not immediately kill himself upon learning that he himself was the one who had abandoned her, and the one whom he had gone back in time to kill?These are questions any half-serious moviegoer will ask as the story unfolds, but the writers never bother to acknowledge them. The time-paradox is supposed to take center stage and dazzle the viewer. The problem with this is that the twists in the story are quite predictable, and by the halfway point you can see the end coming. The result is a trite, disjointed movie with very little logic connecting the dots. When earlier dialogue in a film is played over the big reveal at the end, it should come as a surprise, tying everything together under a new explanation. It should be an epiphany, a moment of enlightenment. That's what made The Usual Suspects special, for instance. The same effect is intended here, but falls utterly flat because if you've been paying attention, there is neither any surprise to be found, nor a unifying logic behind the story.The technical aspects of the film were adequately handled, so at least it has some merit there, though it should be pointed out that Sarah Snook as a man was less than convincing. This is less the actress's fault than the make-up department's, I would say. They could have at least given her a convincing stubble or mustache if the illusion of a male was to work.In conclusion, this film could only be recommended for those who do not pay that much attention to narrative coherence or proper character motivation. It could be entertaining if you don't usually bother to look under the hood of your films.",Predestination

Intellectually, even for a person who likes science fiction movies such as Inception or Looper, this movie was terrible and badly executed. The start of the story was insanely long and boring. The paradox theory about time travel didn't make sense and was just downright confusing and stupid. Ethan Hawke's worst movie ever.
