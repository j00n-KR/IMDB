0,TheLittleSongbird,"Great title, visuals, soundtrack and action but soulless and unengaging",4,3 September 2011,"Ever since I first heard of Cowboys & Aliens it was actually one of my most-wanted-to-see movies of the year. However, when it came to seeing it I found it a let down. Not all of it is a mess though. It is a well made movie, with cinematography and editing to be admired and settings and costumes that are not only great but show some imagination. The soundtrack is fitting and memorable, and while the first action scene was a tad overlong, the action is beautifully choreographed and definitely one of the more interesting parts of the movie. Plus the title is great and one of the things that drew me in in the first place. The let downs however are in the writing and in the story. The writing is mostly awful, particularly in the slower moments where those moments are peppered with schmaltz, and the story is dull with little satisfactorily explained. Jon Favreau's direction is mixed, great in the action scenes, pedestrian at other points, while the characters are underdeveloped and little more than clichéd. Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford are decent enough but deserved much more than they got, while the female lead was annoying and forgettable. In conclusion, wanted to like it but there were too flaws that prevented me from properly engaging with it. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Cowboys & Aliens
1,Leofwine_draca,Better than I hoped for,6,13 November 2017,"COWBOYS & ALIENS is one of those ""what it says on the tin"" type movies, obvious in content from the title. I wasn't expecting to like it much, feeling that modern-day science fiction films tend to be all about the big CGI effects without much warmth or character to go with them, but I didn't have worried. This film is refreshingly old-fashioned in feel and for two-thirds of the running time focuses on being a western rather than a sci-fi flick, which is all well and good.Things kick off well with Steve McQueen-alike Daniel Craig waking up in the desert, with an alien wristwatch and a cracking headache/case of amnesia. He's soon involved in a plot involving arch criminal Harrison Ford, but any local enmity is put on hold when the aliens show up in an impressively destructive set-piece. What I liked most about this film is that it's straight-up serious, rather than being loaded with annoying and goofy humour. The performances are therefore better than hoped for, and the direction is fine, with the early, brutal fight scenes really proving successful. Sure, it does go on a little too long, and the ending descends into effects-filled nonsense, but overall this is winning and watchable.",Cowboys & Aliens
2,SnoopyStyle,needs more aliens and less cowboys,6,7 October 2014,"Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig) with no memory is stranded in the middle of the desert with a mysterious shackle on his wrist. Passing cowboys try to take him into the town of Absolution. Jake overpowers them. He rides into town with stolen gear and horse. The population isn't too friendly cowered by the iron-fisted cattle rancher Colonel Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford). Preacher Meacham (Clancy Brown) finds the stranger in his place and treats his wound. The town is terrorized by the Colonel's son Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano). Jake gets on Percy's bad side. Then Sheriff John Taggart (Keith Carradine) notices Jake's face on a wanted poster.The town is all angry and unlikeable. The fact is the aliens come into the movie a little too late. The cowboys part of the movie isn't very compelling. It's a lot of posing. The story isn't all that important. If the movie is anything, it's to pit cowboys against the aliens. I don't see any reason to tease the aliens for thirty minutes. Director Jon Favreau should have made this a straight up action adventure. Instead there is some unnecessary mano a mano between Ford and Craig. They basically step on each other. Olivia Wilde tries to add some likability to the cast. The posse is filled with characters that nobody cares about. There is a twist that tries to make the story interesting. It would have been great if I actually care about anybody in the story.",Cowboys & Aliens
3,claudio_carvalho,"Cowboys, Indians and Aliens",7,19 February 2012,"In the Old West, an amnesic stranger awakes in the middle of the desert wounded in the belly with a bracelet in one of his wrists. He is attacked by thieves but defeats them. He rides a horse of one outlaw and heads to a former mining town, where the local preacher treats him. Then he sees the youth Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano), who is the son of the powerful farmer Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford), bullying with the bar owner Doc (Sam Rockwell) and the other locals. When Percy provokes the stranger, he reacts and beats up on Percy. The local Sheriff John Taggart (Keith Carradine) arrests Percy and he finds that the stranger is the wanted Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig). The sheriff returns to the bar with his deputies to arrest Jake, but he subdues the men. However he is hit on his back by the mysterious Ella Swenson (Olivia Wilde) and he faints. Jake is arrested and when Sheriff Taggart is ready to take Jake and Percy in a coach to deliver them to a Federal Marshall, Woodrow arrives with his men ready to protect his son. But they are attacked by spacecrafts that abducts several dwellers, including Percy, Doc's wife and the sheriff. Woodrow organizes a posse to seek out the kidnapped people in a dangerous journey against an advanced race of aliens. Meanwhile Jake Lonergan has glimpses of his past life and they learn that someone among them may help them in the fight against the invaders. ""Cowboys & Aliens"" is a very entertaining film with a battle between cowboys and Indians against alien invaders. The result is a funny adventure that blends western with sci-fi. Unfortunately Harrison Ford is histrionic and cliché in the role of the ambiguous Colonel. Daniel Craig is great, as usual and Olivia Wilde is very beautiful and charming. I had low expectations with ""Cowboys & Aliens"" and in the end I had lots of fun. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Cowboys & Aliens""Note: On 18 June 2015, I saw this movie again.",Cowboys & Aliens
4,kosmasp,Straight (shooting),6,5 March 2012,"Don't go into this movie expecting some camp fun little movie. You will be disappointed (I guess that might be the reason quite a few people have stated, that they didn't like the movie at all). The movie itself isn't bad, with great acting from ""Indiana Jones"" and ""James Bond"" (that's how they were promoting it too sometimes in the media). And you can tell that Harrison Ford had fun making this.But there is an underlying feeling that there could've been a little bit more. A little bit more back-story, a little bit more CGI, a little bit more meat overall. As it is, it does feel a bit like an adult/western version of ""Super 8"", which itself was an homage to 80s movies. While not bad at all, I felt it did lack substance.",Cowboys & Aliens
5,classicsoncall,"""I don't want any trouble"".",8,6 August 2011,"Let's see...Cowboys...Aliens...Aliens...Cowboys...Aliens and Cowboys...Cowboys and Aliens - yeah! That's the ticket, take a couple of disparate movie genres and mix them together for a surreal blend of action and adventure. My, my, the critics for this film are taking things way too seriously. I was pretty leery about this one going in myself, but just couldn't restrain myself as Westerns are my favorite genre. I don't want to use the pleasantly surprised cliché, but this was about as much of a blast as I was expecting.The mental picture of the title conjures up guns, shoot 'em ups and big explosions, and on that score the film delivers. I thought the aliens themselves were a little hokey, but after Aliens, Predator and the denizens of the Mos Eisley Cantina, there's only so much left to the imagination out there. The chest burster strategy caused me to groan a little for example, along with the nod to Butch Cassidy's kick to the groin at the former Lonergen camp. In fact, when you get right down to it, there's nothing really new or original here, the aliens even have green blood.But come on, it's Cowboys and Aliens! Nobody's ever thought of it before unless you go back to that OK Corral episode of Star Trek, and those aliens looked like the Earps and Doc Holliday. Just go into this one with one part of your brain lassoed behind your back and you'll be just fine. And for those of you citing this picture as the worst one ever made, your memories are just a bit short. Have you forgotten ""Snakes on a Plane""?",Cowboys & Aliens
6,jboothmillard,Cowboys & Aliens,7,24 January 2012,"When I saw the trailer for this film at the time of its release, I got very excited about seeing it, because it is not often you bring together two genres that normally wouldn't go together, from director Jon Favreau (Elf, Zathura: A Space Adventure, Iron Man). Basically, set in the Old West, 1873, in Arizona Territory, an unnamed loner (Daniel Craig) wakes up in the desert with injuries, no memory and a strange metal band shackled on his wrist, and after beating up three thieves trying to rob him he takes their clothes to put on and ride to the nearest town. He finds the small town of Absolution, where his wound is treated by preacher Meacham (Clancy Brown), and after a tussle with drunken Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano), the stranger is recognised as wanted outlaw Jake Lonergan by Sheriff John Taggart (Keith Carradine). Mysterious woman Ella Swenson (Olivia Wilde) stops Jake from escaping, and wealthy and influential cattleman Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) stops him and his son Percy being arrested, Jake also apparently stole some of the iron-fisted Colonel's gold. During their standoff in the night, all of the sudden some strange lights come towards the town from the sky, and alien aircraft start attacking with their weaponry, and abducting the Sheriff, Percy and some others, the attack ends though when a Jake fires at a ship with device in his wrist shackle. Dolarhyde and Ella with many of the townspeople form a posse to look for an extra-terrestrial that apparently ejected, while Jake goes to an abandoned cabin, and has a memory flashback of taking the stolen gold there, and he and Alice (Abigail Spencer) being abducted by aliens. When he returns to the posse they have a close encounter with the alien they were looking for, and Meacham gets killed as he sacrificed himself to save Sheriff Taggart's son Emmett (Noah Ringer), and by the morning many of the people have abandoned them. Jake tries to get his former gang to join them in their journey, but they don't join, and then in another night alien ships attack again, with Ella being captured, and Jake causes the ship she is in to crash and her get fatally wounded. Next Chiricahua Apaches, i.e. Native Americans, capture the posse, blaming them for bringing the aliens, and as Ella's body is burned on the fire, she suddenly resurrects, revealing that she is in fact an alien who came to Earth to escape the other aliens who destroyed her home planet. She explains that the aliens she is also in fear of came to Earth because of the gold supply, they use the priceless rocks as fuel for their ships, they also experiment on human beings. Ella also says that Jake with his gauntlet (directed energy) weapon s the key to locating and defeating the aliens, they may be more superior to humans but they can be killed, and with an Apache medicine he has a flashback of Alice dying, stealing the weapon and where the aliens are in the desert. Led by Dolarhyde the group go to the location of the grounded mother ship, and Jake convinces his old gang to join the fight, and he and Ella board the ship, releasing captives along the way, but he ends up captured. In the final moments Dolarhyde saves Jake, and with Jake's metal shackle off his wrist, this is activated by Ella as a high explosive device and she sacrifices herself, destroying the alien ship, and it ends with wanted man Jake allowed to go and ride away. Also starring Sam Rockwell as Doc, Adam Beach as Nat Colorado and Buck Taylor as Wes Claiborne. Craig put on a good American accent and was a cool rough cowboy, and Ford was also a good as the grouchy not to be messed with Colonel, there are certainly some eye catching sequences with the help of the terrific special effects, and it is a good mix of The Searchers (and the Man with No Name format) and Independence Day, without becoming Wild Wild West nonsense, a most watchable science fiction western adventure. Very good!",Cowboys & Aliens
7,ccthemovieman-1,Decent Escapist Fare; Exceeded Low Expectations,8,26 December 2011,"Overall, don't let the goofy title keep you from at least renting it, because it is a fun trip and good escapism fare. It also helps to have low expectations! Yes, the title and some of the previews made this appear to be another cheesy over-the-top action film of today.....but with Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig in the lead roles, it had to be more than just some corny B-film....and it was. It was fun to watch. Sure, it's goofy, especially in the last 30 minutes, but it's definitely a fun ride.Craig, as ""Jake Lonergan,"" was the star, and the most interesting person, probably because his history and character (and the strange device on his wrist) weren't revealed right away, just in bits and pieces as the story evolved. He did a nice job with the American accent, too.The aliens and their ships were kinda cool, too - not the best I've seen, but not bad. I'd say the same for the special-effects, overall, too. The sound was outstanding, with good rear speaker contributions.Like Craig, Olivia Wilde as ""Ella Swensen"" also was a mysterious character and her nature wasn't revealed until 3/4ths of the way through, either.It was shocking to see Ford as a ""bad guy"" but ""Woodrow Dolarhyde"" slowly changed his attitude and became more like the ""Indiana Jones"" guy who we all know and love.",Cowboys & Aliens
8,rmax304823,The Title Says It All.,3,6 October 2012,"Cowboys, bandits, Mexicans, Chiracahua Apaches, horses, dust, a beautiful girl, gold fever, and monsters.I don't know what such competent but non-bravura players like Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig are doing in this orthodox extravaganza of special effects. Ford is turning into one of those seasoned old coots who knows his way around. Daniel Craig has yet to make it as anything but a prisoner or a superhero. And -- well, I'll give Olivia Wilde a pass, whatever she's there for. Her face has the exquisite perfection of a model's. When she's thrown into a river, she appears from underwater with her make up intact.Well -- what do you want, egg in your beer? That's the kind of movie this is. It's aimed at children or, I suppose, at adults who have been living on top of some marble pillar in Turkey and have never seen what computer-generated visual effects look like.It's not worth going on about. The monsters from the space ship have come here to mine all our gold and prepare the way for a conquering horde. Their object is to take our wealth and learn our weaknesses. Monsters after gold. There's a new one. They're slimy. When they open up or morph or whatever they do, the sound is that of a wooden paddle in a pot of molasses. They can build huge space ships but cannot speak. They can only roar or growl, rather like King Kong, but in Dolby Digital.Watch it if you must. Olivia Wilde emerges nude from a bonfire but the director has the bad taste to shield most of her from the view of the audience.",Cowboys & Aliens
9,BA_Harrison,Cowdung and Aliens.,4,13 March 2012,"Daniel Craig plays Jake Lonergan, an outlaw in the Wild West who, along with the help of rich and ruthless cattle owner Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford), mysterious beauty Ella Swenson (Olivia Wilde) and few dozen assorted cowboys and injuns, battles an alien race intent on invading Earth for its gold.Genre blending blockbuster Cowboys & Aliens has a mega budget, a 'hot' director, and A-list stars to its advantage, but is seriously hampered by an extremely poor script that does very little of interest with its 'high concept'; this leaves director Jon Favreau no choice but to fill his film to the brim with impressive cinematography and stunning special effects in an effort to disguise the lack of a decent story. Lovely imagery and cool CGI can only go so far, however, and the movie soon becomes very tedious, it's flaws all too evident (so many, I don't even know where to begin) and it's running time way too long.",Cowboys & Aliens
10,paul_haakonsen,Guns and lasers blazing...,7,19 November 2011,"Having seen the trailers, I was really looking forward to this movie. And now that I have seen it, I can honestly say that I wasn't disappointed. However, the concept of cowboys and aliens thrown together into one pot still does seem a bit odd to me.The story in ""Cowboys & Aliens"" is pretty easy to follow; Jake Lonergan finds himself without his memory and a pretty neat-looking bracelet around his wrist. Thrown into a desperate fight against a far superior species, Jake, the people of Absolution and the native Americans find themselves in a showdown for supremacy.I must admit that the story is fairly much on the 'no-brainer' side of the storyboard. This is the type of movie where you can switch off your brain and just run on the adrenaline alone. There is action from the start of the movie and right up to the end of it. The fight scenes were really nice to look at, lots of guns blazing (both archaic and future guns), explosions and in-your-face action scenes.The movie is making good use of make-up effects and CGI effects. The aliens look awesome, and they look so life-like that it is bordering on being too real. Thumbs way up for the effects team on ""Cowboys & Aliens"", they sure did a great job.As for the cast, then I think they got a good group of people together for the movie. And I must say that Daniel Craig (playing Jake Lonergan) is more cut out for something like this, rather than playing James Bond. And it was really good to see Harrison Ford (playing Woodrow Dolarhyde) in this movie. He is in top shape here and putting on a really good performance, both in acting and action scenes.""Cowboys & Aliens"" is a good movie for an evening of mindless action entertainment. If not for the action sequences, then for the effects and CGI. Compared to some of the recent movies that make heavy use of CGI effects, ""Cowboys & Aliens"" came off as more than just a shallow story trying to stay afloat by effects alone.",Cowboys & Aliens
11,ComedyFan2010,A nice western with some extra sci fi,7,5 January 2018,"Well the title itself tells us all what to expect and if this is appealing to you you should enjoy this movie. Maybe one's expectations can be too high but even then one gets both elements of western and sci fi in it to be entertained.Western is pretty much a dead genre. One really doesn't see many of these movies being made. Maybe it is because so many have been done in the past and some feel it all has been shown. In this case just add some aliens to it. After all if one makes a sci fi movie about aliens invading the Earth it could have happened in the past centuries!So we get a lot of elements from the typical Western movies that we get to enjoy in a nostalgic way but then the aliens come and the movie becomes so much more entertaining.The casting is absolutely perfect. All actors fit perfectly to their part and act in a real Western style. Maybe one could make the aliens more sophisticated than just monsters attacking, but this would change the style of the movie. Make it a more philosophical sci fi/western. In my opinion it was best to leave it this way to make it feel more like a western with lots of action.",Cowboys & Aliens
12,edwagreen,It's All Alien to Me-Cowboys & Aliens 1/2*,1,22 October 2012,"This is a class A stinker of the worst kind. To paraphrase, it's ""a close encounter of the worst kind."" Why? The premise is absolutely awful. Aliens invading the old west to wreak havoc on the people there.It's so bad that you eventually don't even care about the people who are kidnapped by these monsters.How Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford ever allowed themselves to be talked into this mess of a project is beyond me.Even the characters can't develop here because the writing and general premise of the film are both so awful.A colossal bomb ranking with such flops as ""Spaceballs,"" some years back.",Cowboys & Aliens
13,michaelRokeefe,A spaceship falls from the Arizona sky.,6,8 March 2012,"Are you ready for some cowboy Sci-Fi? Jon Favreau directs this convoluted tale that takes place in Arizona in the late 1800s. Ranchers and cowpokes, led by a mysterious gunslinger Jake Lonergan(Daniel Craig)are fiercely feuding with the local Apache Indians. Having the most at stake is cattle baron Woodrow Dolarhyde(Harrison Ford). A spacecraft lands carrying some odd looking creatures with full intent of making slaves of the human race. Cattle rustlers, six-gun-shootin' cowboys and Apaches agree on a truce long enough to fight a swarm of uninvited extraterrestrials. Some nice special effects, actually filmed in New Mexico. A well rounded supporting cast includes: Keith Carradine, Sam Rockwell, Clancy Brown, Adam Beach, Buck Taylor and the ever fetching Olivia Wilde. Its like Star Trek meets the Wild, Wild West.",Cowboys & Aliens
14,hitchcockthelegend,I've seen good men do bad things and bad men do good things.,7,6 January 2012,"Cowboys & Aliens is directed by John Favreau and collectively written by Damon Lindelof, Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby and Steve Oedekerk. It stars Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Olivia Wilde, Clancy Brown, Walton Goggins and Sam Rockwell. Music is scored by Harry Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Matthew Libatique.It's 1873 in the Arizona Territory, and an unnamed loner (Daniel Craig) awakens in the desert bleeding from an injury, with no memory, and with a strange metal bracelet shackled to his wrist. Making his way to the nearby town of Absolution, he discovers his name, what happened to him and finds that soon, he, and the citizens of Absolution, must engage in a fight for friends and family against an alien race.Silly title, it really is. More so because it has been proved to be misleading as to the content of the actual film. Oh there is cowboys and aliens in the film, and great fun at times it is to see two genres spliced into one big money backed movie. But the title does lend itself to an expectation of wall to wall froth, a world where tongues are in cheek and explosions surround a bunch of jovial Western characters as they face off against an alien foe. As anyone who has seen the film can attest, Cowboys and Aliens is anything but frothy. It proves to be an uneasy blend of genres, a task that director Favreau and the ream of writers involved in the project, don't fully complete. You have to wonder if the number of writers involved lost sight of a collective goal? Because the film at times comes off as a gnarly, grizzled machismo piece, taking its story seriously, only to then stop taking itself seriously to bring the no brain thrills for the popcorn crowd. It's no wonder that it has failed to find an audience since it's not sure how to find itself!Money makes you soft.However, a second viewing of the film can bring better rewards once armed with the knowledge of what type of film it is. There's much to enjoy, from a mostly agreeable cast to the excellent Western visuals; and from the well constructed action set pieces to the outrageousness of the premise, Favreau's film has plenty of guts, grandeur and gunnery to keep the undemanding entertained. The flaws remain (cliches, stereotypes, logic holes), and in fact the weak plot and reasoning for the alien motives is even more annoying second time around. But it's never dull and the visual effects are more charming than most other big budgeted blockbusters. That the effects are not swallowing the film whole is a big plus, it puts the human characterisations front and centre, where the likes of Craig, Ford (both mean and broody), Rockwell (excellent) and Brown (likewise) come to the fore to at least keep us interested in how it all pans out before the inevitable battle provides the answers. While from a red blooded guy point of view, more of the lovely Olivia Wilde instead of showy alien effects is fine by me, even if her character is pretty much a token one.Second viewing brings better rewards, yet it's always going to struggle to find a fully committed fan base, but it's far from being the disaster some disappointed first time viewers proclaim it as. Not a great film for sure, but it is a good one. 7/10Footnote: It scrubs up real well on Blu-ray, the work of Libatique comes shining through as the Western vistas please the eyes with their detail, while the low lighting for the interiors gives off a nice Wild West hue.",Cowboys & Aliens
15,LeonLouisRicci,Corny Cowboys and Abysmal Aliens,1,18 August 2012,"Great concept, but couldn't be more disappointing. Should have been a hoot. It deserves the boot.It took five writers to do this. Really? Given the mythology to draw from they should be ashamed of themselves and donate their salaries to MUFON or Real West magazine.There is nothing in this movie to recommend. The western portion is as stale as stable stuff and the alien element is completely clichéd and unconvincing. It all is presented with stodgy scenes with no suspense and no surprises. OK there is one twist in the middle, but that is so corny and contrived that all the characters react with nothing more than a dumb look as if to say, is it time for the next boring scene and they just move along as if nothing happened.The action is so routine and the aliens are so uninteresting that this comes off as something made by people who have never seen an alien film or a cowboy movie.",Cowboys & Aliens
16,Bunuel1976,"COWBOYS & ALIENS (Jon Favreau, 2011) **1/2",6,20 August 2011,"I had intended watching Terrence Malick's THE TREE OF LIFE (2011) for my birthday but its local theatrical release has been postponed by some 3 weeks, so I ended up with this unlikely Western/Sci-Fi hybrid instead! The film was inspired by a comic book, but the expected sense of awe and fun is not always communicated to the audience (especially since its two leads/heroes – Daniel ""James Bond"" Craig and Harrison ""Indiana Jones"" Ford are depicted so dourly)!; besides, the mix-up of genres is not really thought out (despite the involvement as producers of such fanboys like Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard), and mostly it just feels like two different films slapped together to make up the required 2-hour duration! The opening is intriguing enough, with the wounded Craig waking up in the desert an amnesiac and who also has a strange bracelet attached to one wrist (which he later discovers can 'shoot' rays that prove far more deadly than your typical pistol!). When he rides into the nearest town and after being patched-up by preacher Clancy Brown, he is recognized as the leader of an outlaw gang who had abandoned (and double-crossed) his cohorts, apparently for love of a woman who has in the meantime herself disappeared without a trace! Thus, he immediately attracts the attention of sheriff Keith Carradine but also falls foul (by protecting meek bartender Sam Rockwell) of the spoilt-brat son of grizzled cattle-man and town patriarch Ford. The two, therefore, end up in prison with the kid promising his dad will make the 'newcomer' pay for what he did to him – but Ford already has his hands full as his cattle is wiped out by what, according to the sole surviving cowhand, was a fire come out of the sky! Indeed, when he does get to town himself and is about to face Craig (after giving the trouble-maker son a piece of his mind), the town is invaded by flying saucers and a number of the townspeople are abducted in the ensuing mayhem; as expected, normal gunpowder is useless against the 'metal-ships' but Craig's bracelet, once activated, manages to bring down one of the alien craft! Incidentally, since his arrival, Craig has been bugged by a woman (Olivia Wilde) who claims she knows him and, consequently, can shed light on his current predicament – the revelation concerning her character, which also has her taking up Native American speech so as to communicate with an Indian tribe that turns up along the way and rally them to the 'cause', is unconvincing to say the least. Anyway, it turns out that gold is a source of fuel for the aliens so that, when Craig flashes it in front of his wife, they come down on their house, literally evaporate her but, despite having torn into his flesh (hence the gash in his side), Craig manages to break free and escape (even if there is a quasi-subliminal suggestion that his 'time-out-of-mind' period was somewhat longer than we have been led to believe!).As inferred by the title, then, Cowboys face-off with Aliens before long and, in spite of the latter's obviously superior resources, the former are not about to let them have a run of the land without a fight (though they rely on Craig's gizmo to do much of the damage to the enemy!). Complicating things further is the introduction of Craig's understandably irate former mateswhile Ford has to contend with the adoration of an orphaned Mexican he had raised as his own but thereafter merely kept as a general-purpose boy around the ranch – likewise, he is entrusted with the care of Carradine's grandson after the sheriff is shanghaied to be studied by the aliens. For what it is worth, this potentially sentimental but undeniably affecting subplot emerges as the film's most unexpected yet rewarding aspect (apart, that is, from the sheer joy of watching veterans Carradine and Brown in a prominent theatrical feature in what seems like a dog's age). By the way, among the other victims are Ford's genuine flesh-and-blood and Rockwell's nagging wife, which he loves regardless and so has learned to defend himself in the interim and now tags along for the ride to save humanity from extinction.To get to the design of the extra terrestrials themselves, the film-makers have come up with nothing more original than the 'monster-within-a-monster' concept popularized by the ALIEN series but, then, these are given no personality whatsoever – they are just there to kill and be killed – nor is an attempt at communication ever madewhich brings us to the baffling fact that not even the cowboys are made to question what is really going on, except from a simple ""what the hell?!"" initial reaction when they could have had but the rudimentary knowledge of the universe and just what lies beyond the Earth!",Cowboys & Aliens
17,zardoz-13,Surprisingly Good Sci-F/Western Hybrid,8,9 August 2011,"The first time that Hollywood crossbred a western with a science-fiction saga was the 1935 Mascot serial ""The Phantom Empire."" In this largely forgotten twelve-chapter cliffhanger, famous singing cowboy star Gene Autry clashes with an advanced civilization of subterranean humans over 20-thousand feet beneath his property on Melody Ranch. Technically, these subterraneans were not of the same Earth as Gene Autry. Instead, they hail from deep within the Earth. They possessed technology and armaments that Gene Autry had never seen. Of course, Gene wielded their own technology against them to defeat them. The fracas blew up because everybody was fighting over the radium in the ground of Melody Ranch where Autry warbled western songs. Since then Hollywood never mashed-up westerns and science fiction movies. Okay, Hollywood put dinosaurs into some westerns, such as ""The Beast of Hollow Man"" (1956) and later ""The Valley of Gwangi"" (1969), but these constituted little more than lariat epics about dinosaurs on the plains. The closest thing to a sci-fi western was the final installment of the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy when Marty McFly followed Dr. Emmett ""Doc"" Brown back to 1885 in ""Back to the Future III."" The number of sci-fi western mash-ups is few and far between. NBC and Universal Pictures remade ""The Phantom Empire"" as a made-for-television movie in 1979 under the title ""The Secret Empire.""""Cowboys & Aliens"" is a routine outlaw western. Our hero, Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig of ""Casino Royale""), awakens in the middle of a hot sunny desert. He wears nothing but his shirt and his denims. He discovers an unwieldy mechanical contraption on his left wrist. No matter what Jake does, he cannot dislodge the bracelet. Three of the most unsavory looking scalp hunters ride up and find Jake. They inquire about the way to the town of Absolution."" When he doesn't respond swiftly enough to suit them, Wes Claiborne (Buck Taylor of ""Gunsmoke"") and his sons Mose (Cooper Taylor) and Luke (Matthew Taylor) decide that Jake may be a fugitive with a bounty on his head. Jake disposes of the Claibornes with rather adroitly without acquiring a scratch. He appropriates whatever fits and rides into Absolution. No sooner has Jake been in Absolution than he tangles initially with Meacham. Meacham (Clancy Brown of ""Highlander"") examines the wound that Jake has in his right side, and Jake explains that he has lost his memory. Not long after, a scene occurs on the street when a young, obnoxious man, Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano of ""Little Miss Sunshine"") shoots a deputy in the shoulder. He threatens Jake with his gun and Jake kicks him in the jewels. Sheriff John Taggart (Keith Carradine of ""The Long Riders"") rides into town, arrests Percy, and confront Jake in the saloon while a mysterious woman, Ella Swenson (Olivia Wilde of ""TRON: Legacy""), watches with interest. Jake takes on at least five opponents and fells everyone. What he doesn't suspect is somebody behind him who clubs him unconscious. Three cowboys are sitting around a campfire with cattle on the background when blinding lights fill the skies and things start to explode. One cowboy survives and tells his boss, Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford of ""Star Wars""), about the strange occurrence. Of course, Woodrow refuses to believe him. At the same time, Woodrow learns that Percy has been arrested. He gathered his cowhands and rides to town. When he arrives town, it is after dark. Woodrow finds Percy locked up in a wagon with Jake and vows to free one and kills the other. Sheriff Taggart refuses to hand either prisoner over to Woodrow. Just when things couldn't get weirder, scaly flying contraption burst from the darkness and bomb Absolution. When these skeletal looking aircraft aren't firing explosive rounds, they deploy the equivalent of a lariat and carry off citizens. Jake escapes from the prison wagon and finds that the bracelet on his wrist has activated. He fires at the alien craft about to strafe him and knocks it out of the sky. During the fracas, Woodrow lost Percy so he assembles some townspeople, and they head off into the desert to find their abducted loved ones. Eventually, Jake joins up with them. What they discover is a little bit more than they bargained for. ""Iron Man"" director Jon Favreau and ""Star Trek"" scenarists Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, and Damon Lindelof along with ""Iron Man"" scribes Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby have converted a fairly ordinary oater into a lively little science fiction movie. Happily, no matter how incredible the plot remains, Favreau and company play everything straight. They don't poke fun at either our 19th century heroes or the advanced space invader opponents. The creature designs are straight enough so the adversaries look idiotic. Nevertheless, despite their ability to spring anywhere at will in an instant, they won't prompt nightmares. The blood in their veins is not the toxic juice of the ""Alien"" franchise. Mind you, the alien villains here are plenty tough, and they die hard. Indeed, they are susceptible to Apache lances and bullets, but our heroes have to pour on enough of either to make them go down and stay down. These aliens have utter contempt for mankind so they don't expect the licking that they receive. They are virtually indestructible unless their own weapons are turned against them. These aliens wouldn't last a second against the spider aliens from ""Starship Troopers,"" but they are formidable. British actor Daniel Craig makes a rugged, believable anti-hero, but Harrison Ford has the better role. Unfortunately, ""Cowboys & Aliens"" bears little resemblance to its source material, Scott Mitchell Rosenberg's Platinum Studios graphic novel of the same name. Favreau and company have replaced the wagon train plot with the outlaw plot. Nobody suffered from amnesia in the graphic novel, and the aliens could talk. As it turns out ""Cowboys & Aliens"" qualifies as a surprisingly entertaining hybrid.",Cowboys & Aliens
18,grantss,Surprisingly good,7,5 February 2014,"Surprisingly good. The basic premise sounded ridiculous, and a recipe for a mindless B-grade action-only movie. However, it's much better than that.Plot is actually quite solid. Characters are multi-dimensional, and the humans' background story is developed well, before we meet the Aliens. Director Jon Favreau paces the film well and doesn't go overboard on the action scenes.Good performances all round from a star-heavy cast: Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Sam Rockwell, Olivia Wilde.Good entertainment.",Cowboys & Aliens
19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Expectations,7,2 September 2011,"Daniel Craig wakes up in the desert with no memories, and is soon found by fellow resident badass, an aging Harrison Ford(who's still got it... if not as much as Tommy Lee Jones in Captain America), a former officer who has issues with him. That will have to wait, however, as the area is attacked by extra-terrestrials who abduct(using decidedly low-tech methods, considering they've mastered interstellar travel - grappling hooks. I'm not kidding. They also don't go after any cattle, they just... blow it up) characters chosen by a pathos-meter(that is a tad off, because as it turns out, we don't care that much), and an unlikely band of people, including the aforementioned two, have to go look for them. Not Quite Salma Hayek, the wife of Sam Rockwell, the local bartender who gets no respect(insert Rodney Dangerfield joke here), the sheriff who lives with his grandson, Indiana Jones' son(no, not Shia... although Paul Dano plays the role as an equally big jackass), etc. This employs remarkably good casting, such as Clancy Brown as the small town's preacher and the already mentioned great actors(and on that note, everyone does nice work). The mix of genres is an odd one, but it does come out surprisingly well. It feels more like a classic Western(complete with atmosphere, relaxed pace and dialog befitting it) than an alien invasion flick, though it does contain, and do well on, both. The creatures are well-designed, as are their craft and the like. This doesn't go as wild with the core concept as it could(and should), if it can be really fun and exciting(not entirely as much as it should, for what it contains). It takes itself too seriously, and it doen't balance being a part parody(in spite of all the clichés it, clearly intentionally, fits in) and part straightforward movie as well as Scream does. The FX are marvelous. I recommend this to fans of sci-fi adventures. 7/10",Cowboys & Aliens
20,ferguson-6,Get yer Guns up,6,31 July 2011,"Greetings again from the darkness. With such a wonderful title, stellar cast, the director of Iron Man and Elf, and the collision of two distinct film genres - Westerns and Sci-Fi, we had every right to expect cinematic genius. Instead we get OK, just fine, and kind of interesting. I believe that qualifies as a letdown.My view of the film is that the western/cowboy portion is outstanding. The setting and characters are realistic and intriguing. Heck, there is steely-eyed Daniel Craig as the outlaw Jake Lonergan; grumpy Harrison Ford as Col. Dolarhyde who runs the town with iron fist; loony tunes Paul Dano as Dolarhyde's son who is itching for respect; bespectacled Sam Rockwell as a barkeep called Doc; porcelain Olivia Wilde as the not-from-around-here beauty whose presence no one seems to question; and Keith Carradine as the Sheriff trying to do the right thing. We even have the obligatory kid (Noah Ringer from The Last Airbender) and a loyal dog.The weakness of the film is with the aliens. Many have said the film would be better without the aliens. Well, wouldn't that make the title a bit ridiculous? We just needed BETTER aliens. These aliens are smart enough for intergalactic travel but they can't outsmart a bunch of rustlers? And how many times did they capture Daniel Craig just to have him escape? Not to mention that their power seems to come from gold ... and there is a shortage on their planet and ours! The beginning of the film is really, really good. It's 1837 and Lonergan wakes up in the middle of nowhere, just outside the unfriendly town of Absolution. He is wearing a metallic bracelet/shackle around his wrist and no memory of who he is or where he came from. Although there are some terrific scenes, the film kind of drifts downhill after that.All I will say about the story is that the aliens attack Absolution by kidnapping a few residents and stealing gold. The cowboys fight back with six shooters, Lonergan's bracelet, Wilde's knowledge, and some help from the Indians.What really bothers me about this one is that it should have been so much FUN! Instead, it's mostly bleak with only a few comic lines tossed in. My guess is having NINE writers associated with the film was a real problem. Each of the characters holds some interest, but the story just kind of meanders with little direction.A couple of minor irritants for me: Lonergan wakes up and mugs three crusty old cowboys and winds up with perfectly tailored chaps, pants, shirt and vest; Olivia Wilde wears the same dress all the time but never really gets dirty; the cowboys shoot the aliens with guns, arrows and spears - sometimes they die, sometimes they don't; and supposedly the aliens don't see well in daylight. Tell that to the numerous cowboys and Indians who get slaughtered in the climatic battle. Lastly, Olivia Wilde's character is the only one of her type. Where were her fellow ""countrymen""? As I said, the cast is spectacular. It's always nice to see Buck Taylor in a western. Clancy Brown plays the preacher. You will remember him as the prison guard in The Shawshank Redemption. Mr. Brown maintains his top position as the largest head of all actors. Walton Goggins (Justified) plays one of Lonergan's old gang, and brings a touch of humor. And the fiddler is played by first time actor Rex Rideout. Nothing to say about that other than congrats on a terrific screen name! The film is entertaining, but just falls short of what could have been, even what should have been. Watching Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford match wits in the old west is almost enough!",Cowboys & Aliens
21,anaconda-40658,Perhaps the Cowboys Need the Indians.,6,19 August 2015,"Cowboys and Aliens (2011): Dir: Jon Favreau / Cast: Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Olivia Wilde, Sam Rockwell, Paul Dano: An intriguing combination of past and present, old and new that works from a visual standpoint while the plot is corny. Set in the old west, alien spacecrafts appear and abduct everyone in sight save for a few gun wrangling survivors who set off to rescue their loved ones. Jon Favreau previously made Iron Man, which places this project in good hands, but that film is much better plotted and a lot less ridiculous. The visuals here are good with hulking nasty aliens on the attack in search of gold. Daniel Craig plays the hero who awakens in the western desert with a strange mechanical bracelet on his arm. It will later be learned that this is a weapon. He has no memory as to who he is but he comes to realize that his past was riddled with criminal activity and the death of the woman he loved, which lands him where he awakens. Harrison Ford plays a wealthy cattle rancher whose son is arrested due to foul behavior. He begins as a threat to the town until the alien visitors have him joining in the search. This all concludes on a big pow wow shoot out against the aliens, with Olivia Wilde playing a mysterious woman who adds to a great plot twist as well as the plot solution. It is also obvious that sissy bartender, played by Sam Rockwell will grow a pair. Paul Dano plays Ford's ignorant son who ends up being beamed to life in space. Its combination of western and science fiction is inventive despite its total nonsense inspired by that bright light in the sky. Score: 6 ½ / 10",Cowboys & Aliens

But Absolution is about to experience fear it can scarcely comprehend as the desolate city is attacked by marauders from the sky.Screaming down with breathtaking velocity and blinding lights to abduct the helpless one by one, these monsters challenge everything the residents have ever known.

The first twenty minutes of the film, is as good as any western can be, and you can see the influence of Unforgiven a mile away. Then we meet Ford, who who should wear a badge saying grizzled, because he is so over the top here its almost farcical.And then the aliens attack, and sadly, it all goes downhill from there.From so many prolific people on board, I was expecting something special, not a boring destination movie, where the cast bump into bad guys, have a fight, bump into aliens, have a fight and so on and so on.Craig has to be really careful if he wants to stay A-list, as this is truly his worst performance. If you see the guys efforts in Layer Cake, Enduring Love and Love Is the Devil, you will know he isn't putting any emotion into this, which makes the film seem even worse.In a summer chock full of disappointments, this could have had the quirkiness of Men In Black, but plays like a dull Wild Wild West.Rockwel and Brown easily put in the best performances, and when they are screen, it's worth watching. But it's just the fact that so much more could have been done to make this the film of the year, rather than one of the biggest disappointments.And i'm not surprised Favreau didn't give himself a role in this movie.An action Sci-Fi thats dull?

23,Aaron1375,"Finally watched this cowboy film...it didn't blow me away, but it entertained",7,22 January 2013,"I wanted to go watch this film when it was at the theaters, mainly cause I liked the concept and it had Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford in it. I always thought Harrison Ford would make a good western character. Well for whatever reasons I never made it to the film. Then one night while at my girlfriend's house, she happened to mention she had it recorded on her DVR and asked if I wanted to watch it, so I said ""Sure."" Well I finally watched it and it was pretty good. Not super great or anything, but it kept me entertained for the most part. I enjoyed both actors mentioned above, as they made the movie more enjoyable than it would have been without them.The story has a man waking up in the middle of nowhere, with no recollection of how he got there or even who he is. He has a strange bracelet on his wrist which does not seem to want to come off. A group comes along and tries to take him in, and the man takes care of them before heading to the nearest town where a preacher fixes up a wound that he has acquired. Well a young man starts shooting up the place and it turns out his daddy is a cattle baron that basically keeps the town relevant. The mysterious man takes cared of the young man as he is shooting up the place and the baron comes to get his son out of jail because the boy accidentally shoots a deputy. Well aliens invade the town and the device on the stranger's wrist comes to life and he is able to shoot down one of the invaders. Townspeople are taken so the town forms a posse to track down one of the wounded aliens in the hope it will lead them to their kin. There is also a woman, who seems to know more about the aliens than a regular person has a right to.It is entertaining, however, it does seem slow at times. It actually does a fairly good job with being a western, but the alien portion of the film could have used some work. The explanation of them capturing the townspeople just did not work for me, mainly due to their reasons for being on the planet. It seems they could have done their entire operation in secret and not worried about dealing with the people on the planet. They also seem much too savage to be able to master intergalactic travel. They also look like the typical aliens you find in films as they seem like a combo of the xenomorphs in Alien and the invaders in Independence Day.Still, this film was entertaining and it gave me something to do. If Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford was not in it, it would have probably knocked the score down a point as they make the film. There are some good action sequences, but this film is not wall to wall action. It runs a little long too, as they could have cut a few scenes here and there. It also had a number of downer moments that one would not expect in a film titled Cowboys and Aliens...with a title like that, one just expects a few more lighthearted moments I guess. Still, overall it was pretty good.",Cowboys & Aliens
24,gradyharp,Better as a Comic Book,4,18 August 2012,"Scott Mitchell Rosenberg first devised this silly story as a comic book aka graphic novel - and it should have stayed in that format. It is worrisome to note in the credits that the screenplay was written by Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof, Mark Fergus, Hawk Ostby and Steve Oedekerk: six cooks in one kitchen do not a successful meal create. So we know from the start that this is a joke and as a joke it becomes entertaining in parts and just plain silly in others - sort of like a comic book...The 'story' unfolds when a spaceship arrives in Arizona, 1873, to take over the Earth, starting with the Wild West region where a lone cowboy leads an uprising against a terror from beyond our world. A stranger (Daniel Craig) with no memory of his past stumbles into the hard desert town of Absolution. The only hint to his history is a mysterious shackle that encircles one wrist.

Now, the stranger they rejected is their only hope for salvation. As this gunslinger slowly starts to remember who he is and where he's been (excerpted from the package insert).Aside from Daniel Craig (still buff) and Harrison Ford (long in the tooth) the cast includes a lot of mechanical gooey multihanded and body compartmented aliens (identities withheld), Paul Dano, Sam Rockwell, Abigal Spencer, Keith Carradine, Olivia Wilde, and a lot of other one- liner actors.

26,SimonJack,An example of the modern schlock from Hollywood,4,19 January 2017,"Had this movie been made 20 years earlier, it doubtless would have been in the running for a special effects Oscar. But in the first two decades of the 21st century, the output of Hollywood has been saturated with fantasy, dark world, sci-fi, horror and fast action films. So, all the special effects, computer-generated imagery (CGI) and ghoulish creatures are becoming blasé. What is left on which to judge or rate a movie then? Not much, including the acting. These films form a body of work that can best be described as movies of mayhem. ""Cowboys & Aliens"" is a perfect example of this genre. It has the thinnest and simplest of plots, but quite far out. Indeed, such films can't carry much of a plot or it gets lost completely in the mayhem. The more bizarre, the better it seems to build on the mayhem. At the end of such a film, one is sort of dazed by the endless speed and noise. The cast is headlined by big names Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford. But anyone could play these undistinguished roles. This movie was a lame attempt to combine the sci-fi of space with a Western, and it just doesn't resonate as a plot. Give me a good old Western or modern space movie (Star Trek, Star Wars, etc.) any day. But this high-priced film belongs in the trash can with the rest of the modern schlock being passed off as entertainment. In a moment of weakness, I gave it four stars, mostly for the sets, camera work and special effects.",Cowboys & Aliens

It is full of clichés and nonsensical bits, but does that make it any less fun? No. The truth is that if you like westerns and sci-fi, there is no honest reason not to like this one.Bottom line: yes, it is much easier to extract gold from the asteroid belt than invade Earth, as it is to shoot people where they stand rather than run naked and skewer them to death, but you know aliens, they're craaaazy.

29,sddavis63,"Not Especially Original, But Some Exciting Battle Scenes Against The Aliens",5,27 May 2012,"The basic premise of ""Cowboys and Aliens"" is all right. Aliens have arrived in a New Mexico town in the 1870's looking for gold and willing to do whatever it takes to get the gold. I suppose there's no particular reason to believe that aliens from another planet wouldn't consider gold a precious metal that they'd be willing to kill and possibly die for, so why not? As a vehicle for moving the story along it's fine. So right off, the movie blends a couple of different (although certainly not unique) themes: the western-sci-fi hybrid (which has been done before, for example, in ""Wild, Wild West"") and the greed and violence that ensues when gold fever strikes (any number of titles could be used as examples, including a number of sci-fi movies which involved the idea of aliens wanting something out of the earth.) So this isn't especially unique in any way. In the end, I suppose, the lack of uniqueness is the biggest weak spot of the movie. It's rather predictable. We can easily guess that the story is going to lead up to a climactic battle with the aliens, and we can easily guess who's going to win the battle. The predictability of the movie makes the movie as a whole seem rather long. We know where it's going. We really want to get there.The battle scenes are well done, though. The special effects are great - again, though, nothing especially that makes you sit up and take notice. While well done, they're also pretty standard for the genre. The alien creatures are interesting as well. There's a rather subtle message of reconciliation going on here. Various folks who don't like each other (maybe, most notably, the cowboys and ""Indians"") are forced into co- operation and a certain degree of mutual understanding because of the common threat they face. I didn't think any of the performances were especially noteworthy. No one was bad or out of place; but no one was outstanding either.There were a couple of plot points that bothered me. I wondered throughout the movie how and why Jake (Daniel Craig) came into possession of the bracelet that was also a deadly weapon? If it was explained I missed it. The other thing that made little sense to me was the vision of the aliens. We were told by Ella (Olivia Wilde) that the aliens couldn't see well in daylight. For creatures that had poor day vision, they seemed to do well enough in battle with the sun overhead!There's certainly nothing in this that's comes across as spectacular. The story (with a couple of twists) has basically been done before. But the battle against the aliens is pretty exciting in the end, and the theme of reconciliation works as a kind of subtle subplot.

30,Hellmant,The Cowboys work / Aliens don't!,6,2 August 2011,"'COWBOYS & ALIENS': Three Stars (Out of Five)Jon Favreau directed this film adaptation of the 2006 graphic novel of the same name. The movie was in development since 1997 when Universal Pictures and DreamWorks bought the rights to the idea from the comic's creator Scott Mitchell Rosenberg. Steve Oedekerk was originally hired to write and direct the film but after writing the first draft he abandoned the project in order to work on another Jim Carrey film instead. Favreau was later brought on to direct, by his 'IRON MAN' partner Robert Downey Jr. (who was set to star). Downey Jr. left the film to do another 'SHERLOCK HOLMES' movie and was replaced by Daniel Craig. Harrison Ford was later hired to co-star and Roberto Orci, Alex Kurtzman, Damon Lindelof, Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby all contributed to the screenplay. Considering all the project's contributors and changing of hands it's no wonder that the film turned out a bit of a mess. It had a promising premise and decent talent attached but ultimately it's a slight misfire. If you like westerns and or sci-fi films though it still might be worth your time (for mild amusement at least).The film is set in a desert town, named Absolution, in Arizona in the year 1873. Craig plays Jake Lonergan who, as the film opens, has no knowledge of who he is or memory of his past when he stumbles into Absolution. He soon discovers that he's a wanted crook and is arrested by the town's Sheriff (Keith Carradine). The real man that runs the town, Colonel Dolarhyde (Ford), wants Lonergan handed over to him but they're interrupted when viscous alien monsters attack the town from the sky. They snatch up several town citizens, including the Colonel's son Percy (Paul Dano). Dolarhyde soon finds himself teaming up with Lonergan, who also has a device wrapped around his wrist that can blast the aliens out of the sky. The two join forces with a saloon owner (Sam Rockwell) also looking to rescue his wife from the creatures, a mysterious but beautiful woman (Olivia Wilde), a young boy ('THE LAST AIRBENDER's Noah Ringer) and a team of cowboys. The unlikely band then sets out to hunt the aliens down.I was really in to the beginning of the movie. It starts out like a classic 'old school' western with Daniel Craig playing sort of a 'Man With No Name' type. Once the aliens enter the movie though it kind of goes downhill. I have nothing against the genre mash-up, I like the idea of crossing westerns with sci-fi, but here it just doesn't work. Mostly because the sci-fi elements are so ineffective compared to the western elements of the film; the aliens are clichéd and unoriginal and not the least bit frightening. If the creatures had worked at least somewhat better it wouldn't have taken away so much from the rest of the film (the western). While Craig and Ford are good in the movie, and the rest of the cast is adequate as well, the script is too weak for them to play off of and Favreau's directing is somewhat uninspired. I like most of Jon Favreau's other work (especially the 'IRON MAN' films) but here it just feels like he was going through the motions. Despite all it's weaknesses the film is still mildly amusing and entertaining to a certain point. It's not a waste of time if that's all your looking for and fans of the two genres represented are bound to be amused as well.Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nse6Wm1EtZU",Cowboys & Aliens

And for me to like it means something; I am not fond of westerns nor subscribe to the alien-invasion films.We've had hundreds of alien movies and even more westerns. But, how much more vulnerable are we (humans) are against alien life forms than in the old west? At least this film shined the light on a new angle to the age-old creature assault kind.Believe it: we have everything handed to us from the two separate types that we would love if we cared for both genres. A man with no name. A man who runs ""the town."" Aliens with a mission of extraction. A beauty with a secret. A secret weapon triggered by emotion – oh, wait, that's kinda like the Hulk, but still.I enjoyed my time here. It was a fun and (mildly) leave-your-brain-at-the-door feature. Daniel Craig (Man with No Name/Memory) did great and had some exciting action, hand-to-hand combat. The ever lovely Olivia Wilde kept her secret safe to add tension. And the town – and desert neighbors – were alive with great and well-known characters.Sure, the movie wasn't perfectHarrison Ford was annoying, as usual. Why he couldn't be the one that threatened, and then kept, retirement plans like all the other actors that irresponsibly and prematurely stated is beyond me. His last great role was 1997's Air Force One. Please Ford, leave. I'd say, ""While you're ahead"" but that was 14 years ago. We'll still remember you as one of the greats, but you've dug your own grave for far too long.Basic synopsis: Man wakes in desert with no memory and makes way to dysfunctional old-west town which is about to be attacked by aliens. It's up to the disagreeing town folk and neighbors to align forces, with (primitive to us, or regular movie-goer's expectations) whatever weapons possible to defeat the greedy out-of-spacers.Really, it's that simple and stretched for two hours. It should've been shorter, but it still worked and was a fun ride. Even if you're not keen to westerns and/or alien stories.",Cowboys & Aliens
32,Robert_duder,The ultimate guy flick entertains but is far from perfect,7,1 January 2012,"I had huge expectations for this movie. Legendary Harrison Ford, and guys guy Daniel Craig together in a blockbuster sci-fi western based on a graphic novel, had me just drooling to see this. There is a lot of really great things about the movie but when all is said and done it leaves you wanting so much more from it. Ford and Craig are good together, but Craig's character is a little too much brooding and not enough in your face action or depth. Ford is good in his role though and does the part perfectly. I don't know if I like Olivia Wilde or not...she was good on House...but then in something like this her character is a complete waste of space. She has no point at all to the story and she just looks silly in the film and her entire purpose is pointless. The supporting cast is also good with some decent performances by Sam Rockwell, Adam Beach and Keith Carradine. The special effects are stunning and it truly is a great concept for a movie that is actually sort of unique. Director Jon Favreau certainly knows action and he keeps the story going at a good pace. I suppose the only issue with the movie is that it never truly hits a climax, you're never truly 'wowed' by it and you want to be very badly. Still action sci-fi lovers should check it out and I would like to think they'd consider doing a sequel to try and bring out the best parts we all wanted to see but I don't think it did well enough to warrant a sequel.

Basically though, it's a B-movie that's elevated to the heights of an A-movie courtesy of some top notch stars (our very own Daniel Craig - doing a passable American accent and, of course, the ever great Harrison Ford) and a decent budget.The proper stars and budget naturally make a great movie with plenty of fun (if a little stereotyped) characters and realistic-looking (not to mention nasty) aliens to fight.The film's longer than the average ninety minutes, but don't let that put you off. The opening half hour establishes the characters nicely and from then on the action flows.Aliens who fly around in space ships and pack big laser guns versus cowboy with six-shooters and Indians with spears and bows and arrows makes for the perfect mismatch. You can't help but root for the humans. They do a great job and it's awesome to watch - the perfect popcorn flick. The only thing missing from the film was a part for Sigourney Weaver. I think it would have been great to see 'Ripley' riding with cowboys while slapping the odd alien along the way!http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Cowboys & Aliens
34,MLDinTN,More fun than I expected,6,22 September 2012,"This movie was more fun and better than I thought it would be. The aliens, even though they were rip offs of Ridley Scot's aliens, were better CGI than expected. But why were they after gold? I didn't get that unless it was for energy.Any ways, Jake, played by Craig, has lost some of his memory but knows something weird is going on. He has a bracelet that can zap people and he knows something happened to his lady. He wonders into a town, only to have a lot of the townsfolk captured by the aliens. So, him, survivors set out to find them and eventually join forces with Indians. The story did make sense, it was terrible.FINAL VERDICT: OK action film.",Cowboys & Aliens
35,g-bodyl,This Is What I Call Fun!,8,9 March 2013,"Cowboys and Aliens is not a bad movie as many people have suggested. Granted, I was turned away from this film because the I was not amused or turned on by the trailers. This film also has a director who knows these kind of genres. Jon Favreau happens to be the one who directed the enjoyable Iron Man films, Elf, and Zathura. I also liked this movie because they made the attempt to do something never seen before in film: to combine the genres of sci-fi and western. I thought it was a successful attempt. The story was a little weak but the action, visual effects, and great acting all make up for it.This film is about some guy Jake who wakes up in the middle of the desert not knowing who he is and why he had a strange bracelet on his wrist. He finds out that he is a wanted man. He also happens to get himself caught up in an alien invasion as these aliens are taking away humans from towns and tribes.As always, Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford deliver fine performances. Ford still looks good for his age and is able to do some good action scenes. Of course, he has is trademark grumpiness in the film. Daniel Craig is good as the cold-blooded Jake. I also liked the supporting cast led by Sam Rockwell and Olivia Wilde.Overall, I had a very fun time with this film. I liked the genre fusion and most especially, the alien designs. These creatures are unlike anything I have seen in a sci-fi which is always good. There are some plot holes and a weak script, but great acting and solid direction is what makes this film enjoyable. I rate this film 8/10.",Cowboys & Aliens

When a machine nobody has seen before attacks the town and the strange thing on Jake's wrist stops it they all realize that Jake is the only hope. I will begin by saying that this is not what I expected. I thought this was going to end up being a sci-fy comedy or a comic book type movie. This was actually a serious western with aliens thrown in, and I really liked it. This is one of the few big budget movies that I have seen that is made better by the casting. Harrison Ford pretty much makes any movie he is in better anyway though. I do have to say that the hype this movie received was too much and had a hard time living up to it, but it did come close. If you are looking for a light-hearted type movie this is not it. This did have a couple slow parts in it but overall this was very entertaining. It may sound strange but this is one of the best westerns to come out since ""Open Range"". Overall, a very good western with a sci-fi twist. I give it a B+.",Cowboys & Aliens
38,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,7,9 December 2011,"Cowboys & AliensThe real reason extraterrestrials visited the Old West was because outhouses were the ideal probing stations.And while they aren't knee-deep in pioneer poop, the aliens in this sci-fi film are abducting cowpoke at an alarming rate.Waking in a desert with no recollection of who he is, or what the device fettered to his wrist is, Jake (Daniel Craig) heads to the nearest town for answers.There, he runs afoul of Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford), a wealthy cattleman he fleeced earlier.Before they can duel, however, aliens attack and snatch up citizens, including Dolarhyde's son (Paul Dano).Now, a posse consisting of Dolarhyde, Jake, Doc (Sam Rockwell) and a drifter (Olivia Wilde) must embark on a rescue mission.While the genre amalgamation is bewildering at first, the end product is succinct and surprisingly entertaining.However, instead of annihilating them, early-Americans should've teamed with the aliens to steal Texas from Mexico.

39,vincentlynch-moonoi,This stinks,5,9 November 2012,"I remember not going to see this film at the theater because I thought it was going to be dumb, and I don't like wasting money. I was right. But as I was watching this film on cable, I wondered why I was sitting through it. And finally I realized it was because sometimes it's enjoyable to just wallow in the dumbness of some movies.Although I've been aware of who Daniel Craig is, this is the first of his films that I've seen, and his acting here was decent. But doesn't a really good actor have a sense from a script when a film is going to be lousy? This is the first Harrison Ford film that I've seen that I've been disappointed in. In fact, about the only thing it accomplished in terms of Ford's career is pointing out that he is now an old man. Bad choice, Harrison.Poor Adam Beach -- a pretty good American Indian actor. This has to have been his worst role.No one else is even worth mentioning. Well, one more -- the boy actor Noah Ringer. Probably the best performance in the film.Some of the special effects here were quite good, while other times they were poor (for example, the gold in the cabin). But, come on, a cowboy jumping on a flying rocket? There are too many absurdities in this film to mention them all.It is said that Cole Porter wrote ""I Love You"" to intentionally be the sappiest song he could possibly write. Ah well, I liked the song. It appears that the producers and directors here were operating on the same principle. Unfortunately, they succeeded where Porter failed.",Cowboys & Aliens
40,The-Sarkologist,Where a Western meets Science Fiction,8,18 September 2011,"To put it simply this was not a bad movie. When we first heard of it we thought that the title suggested that it was going to be rubbish. Okay, it isn't a movie that one would put on the list of top literary movies of 2011, but it was a good and enjoyable movie nonetheless, especially if you are the type that that enjoys sci-fi movies.As can be seen from the title, this movie is a cross between a western and a sci-fi, though I am doubtful that fans of westerns would like this movie all that much. One has to be a specific type to enjoy cross themed movies, and usually with cross-themed movies it is the fan of one type that will like it above the fan of the other.The movie begins with the main character waking up in the desert with a strange device attached to his arm, and with no memory. As the movie progresses everything becomes revealed (but this is something that I will not do here). The movie then rolls out like your typical western. The nameless stranger arrives in town to find that there are a lot of problems. The town has run out of gold, the local rancher pretty much runs the place, and his son is a bully. Thus in steps in stranger to save the day. However, as tensions become high, out of the blue, a bunch of alien space craft arrive and start blowing things up and kidnapping people.This is when the main part of the movie begins. It ceases to be a western (to an extent) and becomes a sci-fi quest film as the heroes then travel across country to find out where the aliens came from and how they can rescue their loved ones. The movie then ends in typical western style with the nameless stranger riding off into the sunset (well, not quite) to continue his lonely journey across the country.As I said, I liked this film (even though I did see it in Berlin, it was in English and had no subtitles). It had twists and turns, and one wasn't sure how it was going to pan out. It would have been better if I had not known that it involved aliens, but, as with most movies, marketing is the key, and it probably would not have done all that well if the sci-fi buffs had thought it was a western (and thus not gone and seen it).",Cowboys & Aliens

43,zkonedog,"A Thrill Ride, But Nothing Memorable",5,11 March 2017,"""Cowboys & Aliens"" is the definition of an uneven film. While watching it, you will likely be riveted by the special effects, atmosphere, and just overall unique concept of the movie. In retrospect, though, there is absolutely nothing about the flick that leaves a last influence on the viewer.For a basic plot summary, ""Cowboys & Aliens"" sees wanted cowboy Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig) wake up in an Old West (equipped with a futuristic bracelet) with no recollection of who he is or what he's done to be a marked man. As Jake begins to remember himself, the town is attacked by mysterious alien spacecrafts that ""rope"" certain citizens and fly them off into the night sky. Town leader Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) must then work with Jake (as well as a local band of Indians) to put aside their differences and combat the alien presence.In terms of ""overall experience"", this is an incredible popcorn flick. The alien technology is entrancing, the mood is darkly palpable (at least in the early goings), and the action/adventure rules the production throughout. Simply put, you can't look away once you've begun watching.The trouble, however, is that this is a ""concept film"" at heart. It is like the original story creators (I believe it was based on a graphic novel or some such thing) had this thought process: ""Okay, a guy wakes up in the middle of the old West possessing alien technology, then must defend a town from the aliens. So, what do we do next?"" As such, the ""mystery"" portion of this movie (roughly first 45 minutes) is much more compelling than the ""fighting and climax"" portions, where everything kind of gets messed up and loses its edge.The acting is also a bit mixed. Ford, as per his usual talent, slides effortlessly into his role and provides the best performance of the bunch. Craig, on the other hand, is so emotionally subdued throughout the picture that it is tough to really get behind him and root for his cause. Not helping matters is the presence of Olivia Wilde, who was obviously only cast so they could use her semi-nude body in the trailer (her part is severely underdeveloped & pretty much meaningless in the end).Overall, ""Cowboys & Aliens"" is a decent action-adventure flick...but little else. You'll have fun watching it, but when the credits roll your mind will quickly turn elsewhere, as there just isn't any deeper substance to ponder or recollect.",Cowboys & Aliens
44,Floated2,Sounds intriguing but falls way short,2,29 November 2019,"Featuring two different genres in which we do not see being blended together, Western with cowboys and Sci-fi with aliens. Did not expect much of this film but expected some high quality action and some decent special effects. What turned out was this film was quite bland, boring and nothing too compelling or interesting.It's plot has been done many times before and here they try something different in regard to aliens showing up in the Western world. Daniel Craig is relatively a good actor but he was quite bland and not in the slightest entertaining here. Harrison Ford wasn't exactly better either.This film also took itself too serious and think that hurt it's value. Had it been more comedic and light hearted perhaps it would have faired better. And with a run time of just under two hours, Cowboys & Aliens seemed to drag along. Perhaps this was a major reason as to why it was a big box office flop.",Cowboys & Aliens

Not that it matters; I'm just saying, you know...? The storyline is by-the-numbers familiar (ain't nothing like some clichés to keep the cowboy fans happy), despite the intrusion of the uppity extraterrestrials.

They were just some kinda flyin' varmits or airborne cattle rustlers to these cowpokes...)

46,TheMovieDiorama,Cowboys and Aliens shifts genres quicker than mechanically assisted swingin' saloon doors.,5,25 September 2019,"So, yeah. This is a thing. James Bond, Indiana Jones and The Last Airbender ridin' horses across the dusty western landscape huntin' budget Xenomorphs as they re-enact 'War of the Worlds'. Pretty much sums up the belligerence of five writers cramming in as much stupidity as they possibly could into one feature that clearly needed reining in, especially when the inconsistent Kurtzman and Lindelof are recruited. And would you believe me if I said this amalgamation of ""stuff"" just doesn't work? Well, you should. An amnesiac outlaw wakes up with a strange contraption on his arm, to which he encounters a town being attacked by extraterrestrials. Him and the townsfolk set off to save the abducted innocents and destroy the menacing creatures equipped with unusually tiny Tyrannosaurus Rex hands.Genre mash-ups will always face an overbearing issue, particularly if the two genres in question are juxtaposing each other. Favreau attempts to merge western tropes, such as slow-pacing and Native Americans dancing around a campfire, with sci-fi extravagance. Yet despite the lunacy that the title suggests, he takes the blend far too seriously, essentially relinquishing all of the fun that was promised. This is by no means the cast's fault, as Craig, Ford, Rockwell and Dano give commendable performances in order to maintain a sense of tumbleweed buoyancy. Misdirection and derivative writing is to blame.Favreau is unable to iron out the jarring tonal shifts. One minute we've got an intensely acted gunslinger showdown on our hands. The next, spaceships firing lasers in every direction. Another example? A warm conversation regarding adulthood, instructing an innocent boy to become a brave man. Next scene, ol' Zoidberg walks in, causes chaos and diminishes the sprouted character development that was so close to growing. The genre shifts just do not work. Fact. That doesn't prevent Favreau from producing lavishly crafted set pieces that embrace the shoot-'em-up stance. Embedding both practical and visual effects to define that required sci-fi flair. But when the characters are written with no dimensionality, and the story itself is never involving, well it's all for nothing.I was inevitably waiting for the ""Hoedown Throwdown"" to inject some life into the mentally draining plot. Wilde's angelic character really was pointless. Like, utterly futile. Rebirths like a phoenix and provided Craig with some mandatory romance (despite his character attempting to overcome the emotional loss of his lover...). Great. What a waste. When certain subplots are more interesting than the actual story, something hasn't worked. Five writers on the same screenplay is probably your answer. But hey, atleast Gregson-Williams adds some authenticity through his score of grandeur. Wanted to take my horse out back and gallop into the horizon. Yee-haw!Then I realised I watched the film and rather be transferred to Santa Fe for trial. Some genres aren't made to be combined. Western and sci-fi grossly juxtapose each other, thematically and narratively. If Favreau decided to make light of the scenario, then maybe it could've worked. For now though, it's a ""neigh"" from me...",Cowboys & Aliens
47,Movie_Muse_Reviews,What happens when you overvalue a movie concept and undervalue the story,4,30 July 2011,"The answer to the obvious question hovering around Jon Favreau's latest action blockbuster is yes, ""Cowboys & Aliens"" is as ridiculous as the title sounds. Yet blame doesn't quite belong on Favreau's shoulders or that of star Daniel Craig or the rest of the cast; rather, the failure of this alien-infested Western results from the domino effect of the countless studios and producers who put their faith (and money) in a concept rather than a story.To be fair, I know nothing of the Platinum Studios comic by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg, but it couldn't have been all that good if all the hottest screenwriters in Hollywood couldn't whip together a plot worth a damn. The duos behind ""Iron Man"" and ""Star Trek"" along with ""Lost"" writer Damon Lindelof all took cracks at the screenplay and an earlier treatment from another pair of ""it"" writers who wrote next month's ""Conan the Barbarian"" was discarded. Frankly, criticism of ""Cowboys & Aliens"" all stems from a story with lackluster characters equipped with cliché motivations. Despite some cool aliens, the action doesn't offer anything unique enough to counter that we've no reason to care.Craig stars as Jake Lonergan, a stoic outlaw in Arizona sometime in the late 19th Century who wakes up with no memory and some metal device on his wrist. When he arrives in the town of Absolution, the sheriff discovers he's wanted and attempts to ship him off for a reward. That's when the aliens attack, bombing the town and roping up locals before flying off into the night. Lonergan's bracelet activates as a weapon and suddenly he's the only one capable of defeating these things. He joins a rescue party led by a grumpy Civil War vet named Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) and they all set off to find out what happened to their loved ones.The script introduces characters willy-nilly and provides little satisfactory explanation for anything that happens. The story paints Lonergan as a quiet badass, but one who has flashes of some woman he loved. Because his past slowly unravels with nothing revelatory to show for it as the film wears on, it's tough to care much or even see him as capable of romantic feelings. Regardless, a woman named Ella (Olivia Wilde) keeps approaching him with questions he doesn't have the answers to and she evolves into a love interest for nothing but the sake of it. Sam Rockwell has little to no bearing on the film other than serving an example of an otherwise peaceful man who will do whatever it takes to get his wife back. He's a waste in the role. As for Ford, he just gets on screen and acts grumpy and impatient. We've seen everyone on board do so much better. Did these folks not read the script? Probably not considering the number of drafts alone.Worst of all, the script thinks we will care; after all, this is ""Cowboys & Frickin' Aliens!"" In the final sequence, suddenly all these supporting characters have little moments together out of seemingly thin air. What are supposed to be moments in the story tying up relationship subplots between characters end up as reminders that these relationships and subplots even existed in the first place. Consequently, the film's pivotal moments result not in hearts beating, but eyes rolling.In fairness, Favreau shows his adeptness from an action perspective once again in this film. The movie looks good if nothing else with strong visual effects and a strong concept team behind the aliens and related technology. The genre experiment generally works from a tonal perspective, an obstacle that certainly stood in Favreau's path. The film feels like a Western and one in which aliens could feasibly exist, so no problems due to identity crisis.Yet the film never provides a single reason to justify why it had to be a story about cowboys and aliens. In that sense, the movie results in nothing more than several studios and producers thinking we'd simply be interested in a fusion of a shoot-em-up Western with an alien invasion. All involved failed to ask the one critical question when making a film based on a concept: ""is there a good story here?"" No, there's not. Despite every ounce of you wanting to find a reason to care about what happens, none arrives. As such, ""Cowboys & Aliens"" offers watchable but lifeless entertainment.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com",Cowboys & Aliens
48,Vartiainen,"Fantastic idea, which the execution doesn't quite support",7,1 February 2016,"Alien stories tend to take place in certain time periods. Usually it's the modern day, or the not so distant future. If they take place in the past at all, it's usually in the backstory and about how they helped to build the pyramids or something like that. So imagine if you had an alien story that took place in the Wild West. There are no time travelling characters or anything. The alien invasion is set to begin, but about two centuries before humanity is even remotely ready for it.Brilliant idea, absolutely brilliant. The title pretty much sums up the best part about this film. The setting is something we have rarely, if ever, seen and allows for some really cool moments. The film also has a strong cast to pull it off with Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford playing the leads. The former an amnesiac outlaw, the latter a ruthless cattle rancher. The film focuses mainly on them trying to lead an unlikely group of townsfolk against this threat none of them have ever seen nor have any context for.Where the film drops the ball just a little bit is the story. The starting point and the setting are both fantastic, but the film doesn't take full advantage of them. Mainly in that the story could easily have taken place in the modern days. There's very little reason for it to take place in the Wild West, beyond the coolness factor. Also, the aliens are your typical movie aliens. They don't speak, they look rather bug-like, their space ships are dark and twisted caves. You know the type I'm talking about. And that's a missed opportunity. Why not have the aliens take the place of pioneers, with the cowboys playing the role of Indians this time around? Or something like that.But, in the end, the film is a lot of fun, despite its flaws.

50,elshikh4,That's Entertainment !,7,9 March 2013,"I hated the most one thing about this movie: The reviews that were written about it. They should have been bombarded by nuclear bombs till the end of the international nuclear stored! Feels that I'm violent or unjust? OK, bear with me..Though the title is simple, the movie isn't. You have to value its creativity, since it isn't a western movie or sci-fi movie only; it is a western with sci-fi element, which initially makes it a distinct western and an interesting sci-fi in the same time. The story pushed me to remind Akira Kurosawa's (The Seven Samurais) in terms of different men on a mission to defeat a village against powerful evil, also Clint Eastwood's (The Outlaw Josey Wales) in terms of a western with unbroken cliffhangers. Yet, it has its own originality.Moreover, it has the single precious thing that all the action movies of Hollywood misses: THE DRAMA. Surprisingly there are ""characters"" that have different ""problems"", and while the action they find their ""salvations"" appropriately. It's like what the real western movies were back in the day, with seriousness and heart. So this movie didn't relay on CGI alone, it had more to it. And it happened to be rare and well-made ""more""!The premise of it as an action was so ambitious. The equation of Cowboys vs. Aliens has to make you wondering all the time; how the west will win? And the script, along with the directing, did it so right. The differences of powers between the 2 teams do thrill. The conflict's steps are smartly and diligently studied. Every confrontation is calculated, regarding how these dusty cowboys with their primitive weapons could face those advanced aliens with their electronic everything. The last battle in specific is made in a way that convinces you by the cowboys' superiority, so aside from how their eventual victory achieves the impossible, it - also - pulls off looking realistic. The only point to deviate from this discipline is how the gang's men would collect their desired gold; since the script gratifies them with an explosion for the spaceship which spreads some Alien's gold!That cast was dazzling; enough to name: Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and Hollywood's number 1 scene stealer Sam Rockwell. The performances were truthful and effective, except Olivia Wilde who goggled much; as if that makes her character weird enough! The CGI made impressive aliens. And the action reached a high top (the kidnapping long scene, shot in the night, was perfect). Clearly Jon Favreau mastered all the stages of the movie, and delivered a package of absolute proficiency. I loathed only couple of nude, and dirty, moments.This movie was treated badly. When I read what the critics said about it, I feel that they were watching totally another movie. Well, ""Unfair"" is the least word to describe the general look to it. But for me, (Cowboys & Aliens) isn't just a fine piece of work among all the usual commercial movies of its time (like Marvel's superheroes, the teen garbage comedies, the endless remakes and sequels.. etc), but rather an instant B-movie classic. It provides good story with good directing. Solidly built western with flashily shot sci-fi. It makes my mind, along with my eyes, both enjoyed.

There is not much to the story and the 'old west' venue seems more of a gimmick than a contribution. Some of the special effects are good but the titular aliens are neither particularly novel nor interesting, and end up just being grunting monsters with which to brawl or shoot (despite being presumably highly advanced interstellar travellers). The acting is all fine in not very demanding roles although Ford's character is not particularly consistent, starting off as a cruel, brutal, lawless tough guy then mellowing to the actor's standard 'gruff but lovable' screen persona by the end.

But when the aliens attack the town and abduct a number of the civilians, a posse to hunt the aliens and unite different people to fight, whilst Jake must discover his past and what is the real goal of the mysterious Ella (Olivia Wilde).Since directing the Iron Man films Favreau has certainly able to direct action sequences and handle special effects. Cowboys and Aliens delivers on that front and it great blockbuster fun. For a man who is known for have a light touch to directing, Cowboys and Aliens is a very serious film: it is set in a dirty, gritty version of the Old West, it is not a fantasy world like in Back to the Future III. The filmmakers approach is how would a town in the Wild West react to a mystery force. The aliens themselves look a little bit like the Prawns from District 9, particularly how they move. It has been criticised for being too dark, but I still found it to be fun, action packed, with a few little moments for good measure. It was a fast paced homage to classic Westerns with a sci-fi twist. Cowboys and Aliens also sets out to show the different factors, lawman, outlaws and Native Americans, all traditional enemies uniting against a greater threat.Acting wise Craig is a strong, stoic character who has is a man of few words. Because of his role as James Bond he is assured as an action performer and his amnesia is he is very much like Jason Bourne, a little ironic really. Ford has turned into a grumpy, grizzly senior citizen and be was believable as a man who is willing to use violence but having a softer side as well. Olivia Wilde does have a unique look and a bit of a mysterious quality to her: she was not the best performer, but she gave it a go. Noah Ringer on the other hand is still wooden and it will be remarkable to he keeps getting film roles. Much of the supporting cast is solid in what is a pure summer blockbuster.Cowboys and Aliens is not perfect. There are some goofy moments like the Apache scene and problems involving the Ella character. But it is still entertaining.",Cowboys & Aliens
55,Stevieboy666,"Didn't do much for me on my 28""",5,13 January 2018,"Aliens have landed in the American Wild West to obtain gold & kidnap a few locals. Good job James Bond, I mean a ripped Daniel Craig, is on hand to take them on along with Harrison Ford and a motley bunch of bandits, Indians & town folk. With it's somewhat silly title I expected this to be a comedy, and while there are a few funny one liners in the script it is sadly played straight. In fact it's probably too scary for younger audiences. Big budget, big names but after a promising start I thought that it flatlined until the action packed finale, by which time I'd lost a lot of interest. I watched this at home on my 28"" TV, no doubt it would have been far better on the big screen but at least I didn't pay for the privilege.",Cowboys & Aliens
56,dfranzen70,Tired in both genres,5,26 June 2012,"Cowboys and Aliens was made for one reason - graphic novels have built- in fan bases. It's an unfortunate mishmash of sci-fi and western, rather than a cohesive mashup of same, that's just riddled with clichéd writing and acting. You won't want to suspend your disbelief so much as bungee jump it off the Burj Khalifa. Its plot barely works within the narrow confines of its dominant genre (western), and it offers one-note performances and even shallower special effects.A man (Daniel Craig) awakes in the middle of Arizona in 1873 with a metal bracelet on his arm that just won't come off, making it one heck of a lousy accessory. He knows nothing of himself or where he is. But that's okay, because after quickly dispatching three gunmen who figure him for a runaway convict, he heads to the closest town, where he gets himself into trouble by kicking the son of the local Big Man squarely in the cojones.You might be wondering where the aliens enter into this. Well, soon as our mystery man and the scion/scourge are locked in a wagon to take them to Santa Fe (not sure why, since they're in Arizona and not New Mexico), aliens attack. They send out these robotic tentacles that grab various, mostly dispensable townsfolk and take them into their little scout ships. Our mystery man is able to destroy one, though, thanks to that nifty jewelry. Neat gadget, that. The arrival of the spaceships befuddles the town, including local bad guy/Big Man Colonel Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford), one of those typical iron-fisted, ""I gave you your job!"" yo-yos who feel that they own the town, which they often do. With perpetually gritted teeth and the occasional sneer, Ford tries very, very hard to be the bad guy, but he's just not that good of an actor. It hurt to type that. He's a terrific actor and makes a great hero, but he can't do evil. Then again, the movie's title might indicate that he's not the focal bad guy anyway, right?No one knows quite what to make of the spaceships arrival and quick disappearance, so everyone does what comes natural and rounds up a posse to track them down. It's quite a posse, with Dolarhyde, our now-named hero Lonergan, a woman gunslinger (Olivia Wilde), a kid, some old fellers, a Native American (Adam Beach, who is always stuck with that role), and a dog. The movie itself isn't terribly noteworthy, as it takes the blandest, most-repeated aspects of each genre and beats them to death very slowly. Putting aliens in a wild-West setting is creative; doing nothing with that premise is a magnificent failure. The aliens, as bad as they may be, are hardly even seen until the third act, as much of the plot has to do with the unbending Dolarhyde and the taciturn Lonergan at loggerheads. It's another one of those movies where Harrison Ford has lost someone dear to him, whether it's his wife (Frantic), his dad (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade), or even his entire family (Firewall). Here, it's his shiftless son, played by Paul Dano. For all of his efforts to find his boy, Dolarhyde spends little time interacting with him or even talking about him. For the Colonel, it's all about running things and getting results. This is more of a Gene Hackman role than a Harrison Ford role. Ford's effort here varies between constipated and ineffectual, depending on the needs of the plot.The rest of the cast isn't bad. Craig isn't asked to do much other than look menacing and dish out some punishment, and he does both well. Wilde's job is to look pretty and reveal a big secret. Sam Rockwell is the town doctor, a nebbish who (why not) must learn to shoot a gun while on the trail. I won't blame you if you don't pardon this pun, but the movie is a misfire. It does have some real ugly aliens, though. But they seem easily thwarted, if you catch my drift. But a lot of things in the movie just didn't make enough sense to sustain the creaky plot, anyway.",Cowboys & Aliens
57,PWNYCNY,Combines two genres with mixed results.,6,5 August 2011,"When two genres are combined on one movie, in this case the western and sci-fi genres the results can be mushy. This movie combines these two genres with mixed results. First, once again Harrison Ford proves that he is a great actor. His presence in the movie practically guarantees that the movie will be at least watchable, regardless of the story. How, regarding the story itself, it is clever and keeps the audience's interest. Daniel Craig gives a strong performance and the Olivia Wilde is stunning in the female lead. The one aspect of the movie that brings this movie down are the aliens themselves. Their portrayal as being little more than hysterical brutes is completely inconsistent with the sophistication of their technology, which suggests a level of social and intellectual development much more complex than than that portrayed. There is no reason why the aliens should be portrayed as monsters. Just because they are marauders and thieves does not mean that they are necessarily brutish or ugly. Nevertheless, the movie is watchable, primarily because of Harrison Ford whose presence saves this movie from being jettisoned into space, and to DVD land.",Cowboys & Aliens
58,kevin_robbins,The various fights and dialogue for the first half of the movie were pretty good...then the aliens arrive and this movie goes to hell,3,10 November 2021,"Cowboys & Aliens (2011) is a movie I hadn't watched in a long time and recently rewatched on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a Cowboy who wakes up with amnesia and a strange device on his arm. He wanders into a town plagued by a cattle rancher who is their primary source of income and he and his family treat the townspeople poorly. When the cowboy comes to the peoples defense...an alien invasion occurs. This movie is directed by Jon Favreau (Iron Man 1 & 2) and stars Daniel Craig (Layer Cake), Harrison Ford (Star Wars), Clancy Brown (Starship Troopers), Paul Dano (There Will be Blood) and Sam Rockwell (Iron Man 2). The storyline for this picture actually has a pretty good set up. I liked how gritty and nasty both Ford and Craig were portrayed in the film. If this stayed just a Western I think this would have been pretty entertaining. The various fights and dialogue for the first half of the movie were pretty good...then the aliens arrive and this movie goes to hell. The special effects for the aliens themselves were not good. The spaceships were okay but the thought of people fighting them while riding horses was awful. The ending was brutal and seemed to drag. Overall there were some good characters and dialogue in this but the premise was lame and poorly executed. I'd score this a 3/10 and recommend skipping it.",Cowboys & Aliens
59,JoeB131,The Soulless result of Committee Writing,5,11 December 2011,"This was written by a committee of writers, including the two hacks who pumped out the last Star Trek film. So it's just action schlock, really.So I'll start out with the good stuff. Harrison Ford playing an anti-Hero. THIS guy would have shot Greedo first. He's trying to rescue his no-account son while the Native American who looks up to him like a father figure tries to get some of his affection.Clancy Brown was a treat as the Preacher character. Daniel Craig was pretty good. Everyone else, meh, not so much.So these aliens are doing typical alien stuff, abductions, unnecessary surgeries, memory blanking. They refrained from the anal probing, so we'll give them that, but they are never really clear on what the aliens were kidnapping people for. I guess they wanted Gold, and that's fine. Just enough plot to hang the action scenes on, I guess.NO real surprises in this film, really. I'll give it an extra point for Harrison Ford, but that's about it.",Cowboys & Aliens
60,XweAponX,The Searchers on Steroids with Nevada Smith,10,3 January 2012,"And ""the man with no name"".As a western, it follows all of the good structure of any John Ford piece. Just because it has Aliens in it, does not make it a Science Fiction movie.So, I understand the disappointment of certain so-called Eberts who think they know anything about movies, who posted here how bad this film was. No, it wasn't - But all of their pompous reviews and negations of this film were odious.This film can simply be considered ""The Searchers with Aliens in it"". What makes this film great, is that this takes place after the Civil War, During the Indian Wars, and right before the Railroad boom.It can also be considered related to Steve McQueen's ""Nevada Smith"", and aspects of Daniel Craig's character are very similar to the man Steve McQueen plays in ""Nevada Smith"", there are several incidents in both films which reflect on each other. But there are also parallels to ""The Searchers"" as well... And other John Ford films, even the ""man with no name"" films by Sergio Leone.We have two guys, two Protagonists: Daniel Craig, Looking VERY MUCH like Nevada Smith aka Steve McQueen - the Man with No Name, rolls into town and trouble just seems to follow him in, yet the preacher (the great Character actor Clancy Brown) yet still takes him in. The Sheriff, Keith Carradine, is just doing his job, and the Rancher Harrison Ford wants payback for a past injury. Said Rancher has a son, who is the bane of the town, always stirring up trouble from which his Pa has to bail him out- played by Paul Dano, and his sidekick, Adam Beach, who is of First Nation descent, and looks up to his boss Ford as a father.Then there is the mysterious Girl, Olivia Wilde (Qorra from Tron Legacy) who just happens to tote a large gun over her pretty dress - Which is very out of place but it works here. And then the Bartender, Sam Rockwell, who is actually a doctor. And a band of about 40 ravening Gunfighters and Train robbers who Daniel Craig used to lead like a pack of Dogs, And a band of Chiricahua.This film is The Searcher on Steroids: we have several disparate groups of people, Ranchers, Outlaws, Townsfolk, and First Nationers, under normal circumstances natural blood enemies. They all work together here and earn each other's respect.I see this film ONLY as a western, and it has John Ford elements - Especially, the Locations, where you almost cannot distinguish the Alien Spaceship from the natural surroundings, it looks very much like an Anasazi structure found near the SouthWest, reminiscent of Louis L'Amour's ""The Haunted Mesa"" L'Amour's last book which also mixed Science Fiction and Westerns.Where the critics fail is that they are expecting a Science Fiction film akin to Orci/Kurtzman's Star Trek, which proceeded at Warp Nine. THIS is a Western, they did not have Warp Drive, let alone Automobiles, they had to depend on Horses to travel from one place to another. This is actually Star Trek on the scale of the old Southwest area of the US back in the 1870's. So this film does follow the tenets of a Star Trek film only at a pace more befitting to Horses than to Warp Nacelles.This was the Old West, things took time. Searches took time, days - Weeks. And the Old West Frontier, was akin to the Gamma Quadrant - The people who rode in Conestoga Wagons from the East to the West, are the same people who don Starfleet uniforms and travel in starships to all points west of Federation Space.The Aliens in this, are ruthless killers, with no regard for Human life, only for the Gold they are extracting from the ground and anywhere else they can find it. They don't like to handle coins, so they just liquefy the stuff. These things are like, they have Frog's Heads on top of four-limbed bodies, and an extra pair of arms in their chest - This is a weakness, can't tell you more though.My suggestion is to ignore most of the bad reviews - I myself do not go to movies to pick them apart, either I enjoy it, or I don't. This film should have been Jon Favreau's masterpiece- It IS his masterpiece. It's a GOOD FILM, by any standards of John Ford and Cameron/Spielberg/Jackson.This film shows how the characters of men can be changed for the better when they are forced into a situation where they have to live, work and fight side by side with people groups they normally would not associate with - When there is a common threat, it brings these natural enemies together, and who knows, sometimes, they end up not being enemies after that. But that is just the normal way of how friends meet sometimes, many good friends were enemies when they initially met. Unfortunately, this is a fact of life, it should not take calamitous events to bring people together, but that is just how this world works, and even more so in the times where there was no Technology.And it is due to the lack of Tricorders, Phasers, Quantum Torpedoes, Disruptors, Cloaking Devices, AntiProton Beams, Sensors, Radar, Radar Detectors, Metal Detectors, Cars, Toilets, and Strip Malls that this movie is a great Western - A modern Sci Fi movie will use gadgets to move the plot along, sometimes many times the speed that light can flow from the Movie Screen into your Eyes. But the lack of technology in this film is befitting to the plot - And of course, the only man who has access to advanced Tech is Daniel Craig's character - And it is not necessary that he should know what it is, or how it works, or even how to use it! And so, it is that LACK of Tech that is precisely why this is a great Western- And the Relevant Conundrum of this Film is not solved by Gadgets, it is solved by sheer Human Ingenuity and Bravery.",Cowboys & Aliens
61,alindsay-al,a fun western mix with sci fi that should be appreciated,7,10 June 2014,"Yes cowboys and aliens has problems with it but it also has a lot of good to make this film a lot better then most people believe. The story starts in the old west where Daniel Craig's character Jake wakes up with no memory and the only thing he has is an alien bracelet weapon. As the aliens invade and kidnap people he teams up with the colonel played by Harrison ford to take down the aliens. Daniel Craig is a great actor and he is a good lead in this film and had more layers to him then I believe was going to be the case. Now the side characters are a mixed bag for me as Harrison ford is easily the best character in the film and he is the one that you can truly see the development of his character throughout. Also the aliens are cool looking even though we don't see them a lot. However, I did think Olivia Wilde's character was weak and I didn't buy her relationship with Craig at any point. I also found Sam Rockwells character to be annoying and childish in the film. The story is as expected pretty straightforward with a few twists which does take this unique concept and kind of bland it down. Also the script isn't great as ford and Craig attempt to use it as well as possible. The style of this film is great though with the western outfit to the alien technology. From the opening minute to the last this film looks great and this adds to the film. It can be slow at times but the last 30 minutes truly make this a solid film with its pulsating fun. Cowboys and aliens is better then I expected and I believe it should be seen.",Cowboys & Aliens

63,juneebuggy,As long as Craig kept walking away from the camera I was in,6,14 October 2015,"Throughout watching this strange Sci-Fi-Western mash up I was left waffling between this is ridiculous and its just an okay movie. I never did fully come to a conclusion. Its kind of a mix of 'True Grit' meets War of the Worlds' and the combination didn't work for me. I will say that I enjoyed the movie as a Western (even if that storyline was pretty generic) however once the Aliens showed up it failed.Daniel Craig was probably the sole reason I saw this to its conclusion, he takes his role seriously and looks damn fine as a cowboy in 'those' chaps. I wasn't all that impressed with his American accent but as long as he kept walking away from the camera I was in.The movie is action packed, fun I guess and I liked that the story wasn't fully revealed right away so that I had to figure things out, like who 'Jake' is -good or bad, what is the purpose of his cool bracelet, and who the ""demons"" are.The movie opens with Craig waking up in the desert, he is an amnesiac with no memories of who he is or how he got there. After a bit of a dust up with some outlaws he heads into the nearest town, where according to the sheriff he's a wanted criminal. This becomes irrelevant however when aliens attack and abduct several of the townsfolk as Jake and his gadget turn out to be their only hope.Harrison Ford is his usual grumpy old man self, maybe even more so here and for the most part I found his character annoying. I enjoyed Adam Beach in a pretty useless role, was very happy that we saw the dog again and liked Sam Rockwell as Doc. The ending was dumb as was Olivia Wilde's character (what?!) and her thrown in romance angle. 9/28/15",Cowboys & Aliens
64,aharmas,"Boring, Bland, and Bloated",6,31 July 2011,"I struggled with giving this a much lower rating because just the presence of a good team does not a good movie make, and this movie exemplifies a tremendous waste of talent: Craig, Rockwell, Ford, Wilde, Dano, Carradine, people who have done sensational work before just stand in the middle of this mess, and to echo what other people have mentioned here before barely outdistance the biggest waste of CGI, animatronic, and money ever on a science fiction film ever.Several questions are still in my head: 1) Is this really the best reason five writers came up with for the aliens to be in the desert? No wonder the movie ended that way, and I am surprised they lasted the whole two hours if they ended up losing one of their ""bracelets"" so quickly. 2) Are hanging bodies the standard in movies now? 3) Have people run out of imagination when the best they can do is imitate ""Alien"" for their appendages? and I don't Ridley would consider this a tribute.Truly, there is too much botched here and is not because the genres do not mix. Science Fiction and Cowboys have been around before. Do you remember a certain Yul Brynner film? and what about the exciting conclusion to the ""Back to the Future"" trilogy, but those films had imagination, consistent and talented writing, not just a showcase for a waste of money. It's sad that we waited a whole year for this. Really, there is nothing in this film I would recommend to anyone, but I would offer to a warning to those who want to make a good film and say: ""see it and do the opposite of what they did, and you have a winner...""

He is the key if they want to rescue the abducted people.The movie is pure fun. Action and special effects en masse, with a little humor and a few scenes that are supposed to scare a bit thrown in.

Stumbling into town, he suddenly finds himself in a battle with forces from another world ...This movie has a great title, the terrific casting coup of Craig and Ford as the leads, an intriguing western/science-fiction hybrid storyline and a good score, but for me is a bit of a disappointment. Surely this sort of film should be lots of fun - jokes, witty lines, thrills and spills, romance, goofy moments. I should be laughing and gasping. Instead, it comes out as almost unremittingly dour and unpleasant. In the opening scene, Craig kills three guys (including an old man) indiscriminately, and his and Ford's characters, rather than square-jawed heroes, turn out to be a cold-hearted outlaw and a miserly cattle baron, with few redeeming qualities. The aliens are uncharacterised sadistic butchers, there's very little humour, and the ending is kinda downbeat too. Gee, what a great Saturday matinée ! It isn't all bad though; some of the individual story threads are good (such as Bronc, the Indian brave who wants to be a surrogate son, and is the only guy I can root for), Roger Guyett's visual effects are great and the locations are nice (it was shot in New Mexico). Best of all for me is the Ella character, very nicely played by Wilde (who's also terrific in Tron: Legacy) - she provides some genuine intrigue and turns out to be the lynchpin of the story. This movie is okay, but suffers the usual Hollywood six-writers-ten-producers lack of direction - its makers could really do to look at the old fifties sci-fi classics (or the films of Joe Dante) to realise how much fun material like this can be.",Cowboys & Aliens

68,Samiam3,Guns and no glory,5,28 February 2012,"Cowboys and Aliens takes itself way too seriously for a movie entitled Cowboys and Aliens. Thats even more surprising when taking into account that this is a Jon Favreau movie. Unfortunately he brings very little merit to the project. What should have been a light breezy early summer blockbuster instead feels broody, lumbering and overlong.It doesn't help that nobody in the cast looks like they are enjoying themselves. Daniel Craig is no cowboy and his accent is very challenged. Olivia Wilde has no business being in this movie; and not surprisingly, she looks way too clean for the wild west. Paul Dano meanwhile can't decide what he's doing. Harrison Ford is the only memorable performance in Cowboys and Aliens. He has reached an age, where he can convey a little bit of John Huston robustness, when he so desires.As an action movie, Cowboys and Aliens is not incompetent. Its coherent, it's just not that interesting. The battle scenes are spread out across a very confused plot line with an overlong middle section where nothing happens. It's a shame that none of the characters ever become enjoyable company given the amount of time we have to spend with them.

71,Easygoer10,"Has no one seen ""Firefly"" or ""Serenity""?",6,24 August 2017,"I liked this little film. Yes, it is flawed, however the largest flaw I find was the ignorance of the producers (namely S. Spielberg & R. Howard). Hadn't anyone seen the huge cult smash Firefly? It was on for a season in 2002 and 2003? Also the followup big screen film ""Serenity"", made in 2005. I was furious with the ""making of"" featurette on disc for ""Cowboys and Aliens"", which was made almost a decade after Joss Whedon's brilliant series I mentioned. You have to be a complete moron to not know the setting is 500 years in the future, everyone speaks a combination of English and Mandarin (Chinese). All the main characters live on a spaceship, and are basically small time criminals; however, they have morals, character, are funny, are sad, the entire lot. It is an incredibly brilliant show, and has some very good actors. For example, Adam Baldwin (""Animal Mother"" from Stanley Kubrick's Vietnam flick ""Full Metal Jacket""; Morena Baccarin, a gorgeous Brazilian actress who has done much TV sci-fi; the late Ron Glass, who was a star on ""Barney Miller"" for all 7 seasons, Alan Tudyk, a very versatile actor, etc. ""Serenity"" stars Chiwetel Eijofor plus the rest of the cast. Best of all are Summer Glau, a highly trained ballet dancer who is also an actress. Her character is ""River Tam"". Another key role is Captain Malcolm Reynolds, played wonderfully by Nathan Fillion (""Saving Private Ryan""). All of them are cast perfectly. These actors truly live their roles. The series and film is pretty much centered around these 9 characters on a spaceship. It is like a combination of post Civil War America, but set 500 years into our future. Whoever wrote ""Cowboys and Acknowledge this. Not to do so is an affront to to Joss Whedon. It is shameful. Joss Whedon got a 5 minute standing ovation at the 2005 Comic con. He invented the entire world of this beloved show and film. They have literally millions of fans who wrote in to Fox from all over the world. When it was canceled by Fox, so many of these fans petitioned them. USA finally aired a few more episodes. Fans took out a full page ad in the Hollywood Reporter thanking every advertising sponsor, networks, studios, etc. Finally, 2 or 3 years later, Universal gave Joss Whedon the green light for a feature film. Whedon is one of the most underrated director in Hollywood today. Serenity only cost $30 million to make, which they had to beg and borrow to get. I think 90% of the primary characters stunts were done by the actors themselves. In particular Summer Glau (who plays Summer Tam). She is a trained ballerina, and Firefly was her very first acting job. In spite of this, she continued practice as a ballerina daily in addition to her own acting work ethic on Firefly. Joss Whedon knew she could do near impossible bending and splits, so he sent her to fight camp training for over 3 months daily prior to even beginning the film. The stunt crew was blown away with her ability to bend into almost impossible positions. This, coupled with a very sharp memory, allowed her to do She could do 15 to 20 or 25 straight moves, kicks and twists in a row without stopping, which is unheard of for someone that is not an action star. One last thing about Cowboys and Aliens. They had a whopping $163 million dollar budget, and the worldwide sales were only $173 million: $10 million over this bloated budget. Best of all, please note Firefly is the only canceled TV series to date which went on to be made into a successful big screen film: Serenity. Even though Fox only aired 11 of the 14 episode season; even though Fox aired them in the wrong order; even though the budget was tiny by 2005 standards: What Joss Whedon did is only more impressive.",Cowboys & Aliens

73,lemon_magic,"A bit of a disappointment, but still worth seeing (if you like this sort of thing)",7,25 October 2013,"For my money, ""Firefly"" (and the movie finale ""Serenity"") did a better job of combining the old West and Science Fiction. And that hadn't come first (and set the bar so high), this movie might have gotten a better reception. I read the original graphic novel a few years back, and while the art wasn't anything special or slick, the story worked very well on a comic book level.To me, ""Cowboys and Aliens"" is a great idea. A title (and concept) that shares the archetypal resonance of the timeless childhood role playing game, but takes a quick left hook and leaves me going: """"Oh yeah? Heh!"".And the movie looks great, even spectacular. The special effects compare well to other state of the art affairs (like the remakes of ""Total Recall"" and ""Clash of the Titans"".) The old West backdrop is gorgeous and epic, a fit backdrop for the potentially world shaking events being stage on it. Most of the dialog has the proper dry fatalism and ""old time tough"" give and take to it, especially when Clancy Brown delivers it. But somehow, the end results miss the mark. I dunno - maybe the idea of the townsfolk and cowboys all going on a quest to get their families back from bad guys was still too played out. Or the character arcs were too pat and predictable. Also, I'm a fan of Daniel Craig and his roles in Bond movies and challenging stuff like ""Layer Cake"" have been intriguing and satisfiying, and heaven knows he's in spectacular shape here...but he just didn't satisfy as an amnesiac cowboy/Man With No Name. Might be the fault of the character murky motivations and very limited dialog.As I said, the movie isn't ""bad"", it's just a disappointment. There is plenty to like about it, but it just doesn't feel epic and amazing. That puts it firmly in ""7 out of 10"" territory for me.",Cowboys & Aliens
74,Rob_Taylor,Not what I expected and not in a good way.,6,28 November 2011,"I'm not really sure what I expected from this film. Maybe Unforgiven meets Aliens, perhaps? But the reality is more like Maverick meets Independence Day, with none of the charm of either.Cowboys and Aliens is not a bad film, but it is a little more popcorny and action-oriented than I was expecting and less grim and dark than I hoped.I don't really have a problem with it not being what I expected. Sometimes the best movies are ones I completely had the wrong idea about going into them. But here, the popcorn movie-fest that Cowboys turns into sits uncomfortably with its darker, Western beginning.As always, I take exception to the illogicality of certain scenes, included for no other reason than they are mandated by some Hollywood script-writers bible.As a result, we get many clichéd characters and stereotypical scenes. It actually becomes funny when you watch a movie and can identify future scenes almost the moment the foreshadowing is done.So you get the boy who is given a knife and told a story about how it made the giver a man etc. Gee! I wonder if the boy will use the knife at some point in the film in a similar rite of passage scene? Or, the hero flashes back to the death of his loved one, and escapes, maiming the alien that did it in a particularly obvious way. Hmmm..wonder if we'll see that alien again so that there can be a personal reckoning between the two? Yep! And the above examples are what makes this movie rather tiresomely predictable. As a result, the movie it could have been is lost in favour of appeasing the great god Formulaic! In a movie with cowboys and aliens, it's hard for me to nitpick much. But there is one scene, right at the end that made me go Huh? The alien mother ship, replete with smaller vessels that appear to use some form of advanced engine technology such as gravitics, and who use the same gravity-defying technology to mine for gold (don't ask), is itself powered by a massive chemical fuel rocket? Wait...what? The final scene, which involves the alien ship attempting to take off and escape, then being blown to pieces, was uncomfortably similar to certain actual footage of things like the Challenger disaster. I'm not saying it was right or wrong, just that they might have wanted to rethink that one a little.At that point, I half expected the cowboys, townsfolk, bandits and indians (yes, they left no Western cliché stone unturned) to end up in a celebration a la Return of the Jedi, so cheesy had it all become.They really tried to cram too much into this one (even a small bout of Indian mysticism at two points) and it comes across as too busy, trying too hard to be good.As I say, it's not bad. But it could have been a lot better.",Cowboys & Aliens
75,eric262003,Letdown Even on Low Expectations,5,20 March 2018,"My friends would say to me that I wasn't going to like ""Cowboys and Aliens"". However, I dismissed their words of warnings and just went to watch the film with lowered expectations and in with an open mind. There is an ensemble of talented performers. It will have scenes that will make you reconsider and observes that come into the mainstream of things. No matter whatever was said about the movie ""Cowboys and Aliens"" all other excuses pushed aside the fundamental aspect behind it all is that this genre collage of Western, science-fiction, action is that the only excuse I will accept is that plain and simple, it doesn't work. Even when it works to its potential, it still falls over flat. With its star quality and a huge budget depending on it, this flop is all the more upsetting.Daniel Craig stars as Jake Lonergan and his not is what we';d call the best. He's bloodied, bruised, disheveled,and he's sporting a metallic bracelet and he's in the middle of nowhere and as no idea of who he is or how he got here or where his destination he will proceed to next. He then stumbles into a town and we discover that he is a marked man and that a rancher named Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) wants to take him on, until an alien spaceship joins the fray and that's when the party is underway. Now these two rivals will have to put their differences aside and they are joined by bandits and some Native Americans to take down these creatures and send them back to wherever they came from.The biggest flaw about ""Cowboys and Aliens"" comes from the way too much of a good thing with very little to offer. Sure we have a strong cast of talented performers like Craig, Ford, Sam Rockwell, Olivia Wilde, Paul Dano among many others. We have a director like Jon Favreau so this film is in good hands and mind. The budget is very hefty so we're likely going to have enough adrenaline for action fans to get excited about. And we have a subject matter that's bold and not talked about a lot. This is all in place to be to have the makings of a cult classic film. Though the intentions are abrasive in nature, the film loses it by turning in one cliche after another which distracts its real intentions of remaining what was intended to be, an over-priced B-movie.In spite of its early scenes that pay homage to the Western films of the 1950's and Sergio Leone and his spaghetti Westerns, and Daniel Craig sporting an eerily resemblance to Yul Brynner, the film starts to fall flat from there. We get bombarded with a cornucopia of characters we're forced to be fond of and Craig's ""aw shucks"" awkward moments expecting us to be amused, only to end up having them meet their fate and from then on it lazily sails into a stream of formulaic moments while concealing its guilt by distracting us with special effects which were pretty good, but it's still been done to death way too many times which becomes tiring after a while.There are some great moments to ""Cowboys and Aliens"" like first getting to know Jake in the opening scenes was kind of cool and we feel intrigued by the fact he's an anti-hero up for the task in a predicament he never anticipated in. Sure the set pieces were all too familiar, they still manage to be provocative.though at times illogical.Under all that potential, this movie loses steam very quickly and leaves you with an empty feeling of anything but satisfaction. It's a B-movie action film made to look big concealed with all the cliches that the science-fiction and the Western films have to offer. Sure you can see this for the fun of it, but like many anti-heroes films in the Western genre, the plot wanders off with nothing original or anything deemed creative",Cowboys & Aliens
76,pc95,A Little Better than Expected,7,4 September 2011,"I had read some poor headline reviews of this movie and decided to take the dive despite them, and to my pleasant surprise, I was happy to have watched the film. Granted there's nothing of strong content or originality really. (Major Spoiler) The Aliens are after gold (?), and they're more-or-less like lots of other cheesy creature flicks - just killing machines. But the creators and S/EFX department have done a competent job with the Aliens look. Despite that, the movie is riddled with Western Clichés - Cowboys and Indians, bar-scenes, adopted Indian sons and the like. And You know, Harrison Ford should probably just hang it up from the action genre as hard as it is to write that. Ford in his heyday has made plenty of better movies anyway. If you're willing to let all the clichés slip by and the plot devices that were the Aliens be, you might have a good time too.",Cowboys & Aliens
77,lewiskendell,"Love the concept, critical of the execution.",6,20 December 2011,"I liked Cowboys & Aliens (probably more than most), but it has flaws that can't easily be ignored. It's longer than it probably needs to be, and there are lengthy stretches that are outright boring. Serious is fine, boring is not. The focus on Jake's (Daniel Craig) lost memory isn't exactly the most exciting way to tell the story, and the aliens themselves aren't that memorable or fearsome. Like I said, though, I still enjoyed it. Primarily because of the cast, which is full of some of my favorite actors (even though none of them really stretch themselves in their roles). And I won't lie, I'm predisposed to liking almost any movie that Olivia Wilde is in. Add her to Harrison Ford, Daniel Craig, Sam Rockwell and Paul Dano, and it's one of the better casts of the year. The movie looks great, too, and when things do get interesting, it's a fun time.The potential was here for a great movie instead of one that was merely okay, and that's a shame. More memorable characters and a tighter, more imaginative script that gave all those quality actors more to work with would have gone a long way towards accomplishing that. Still, Cowboys & Aliens is far from a bad movie, and I'd recommend watching it at least once to anyone who's interested.",Cowboys & Aliens
78,brando647,You Get What You Paid For...Cowboys & Aliens.,7,29 January 2012,"COWBOYS & ALIENS gives you exactly what you expect when you sit down to watch it; no more, no less. My hopes for this movie were higher than they probably should've been, but for all the right reasons: it was directed by Jon Favreau (who did great justice to the IRON MAN movies), and the cast looked phenomenal. After I watched the movie, I wasn't disappointed per se, but I wasn't thrilled. It was a passable popcorn action movie that works fine for a slow afternoon. It opens with a nameless stranger awakening in the middle of Arizona with a strange device around his wrist and no memory of who he is or how he arrived there. The stranger wanders to the nearest town, Absolution, and gets involved with the locals when he stands tall against the spoiled son of a local cattle baron. He's recognized as a criminal who was involved in a recent gold robbery and, when things couldn't get any worse, alien forces arrive and abduct a handful of townspeople in a violent raid. Now this stranger, identified as outlaw Jake Lonergan, joins cattle baron Woodrow Dolarhyde and the town's bravest in tracking the aliens that made off with their loved ones. Aided by a mysterious woman who may not be what she seems, Lonergan and his posse ride out to confront an alien race that has come to strip mine our planet. Wild West meets Outer Space in a genre blend that might take itself a little too seriously.Western films and science fiction come across as two polar opposites in the context of movie genres. I have a hard time wrapping my head around a truly good mixing of the two. I suppose you can say it's been done to an extent in movies like the original STAR WARS but that was less sci-fi/western and more fantasy/adventure. This is really as close as I can see anyone getting when blending the gritty drama of a western with the flashy, explosive action associated with an alien invasion. I don't think it's that Jon Favreau did a horrible job with the subject matter. I just think the premise was flawed to begin with. It's like trying to mix oil and water. It just wasn't meant to be. I could be wrong (in fact, I probably am) and there might be examples out there of western/sci-fi success stories. I checked out information on the original graphic novel to see if it was just a weak adaptation and nono it wasn't. I haven't read the original novel but the plot summary I read looks like an explosive cheese-fest (two words: anti-gravity horseshoes). In fact, I give kudos to Favreau and his writing team for making COWBOYS & ALIENS as passable as it was. It's got all the ingredients of a good blend: the mysterious gunslinger, conflict with Native Americans, a plot based around the most valuable resource of the period, and, of course, aliens. I guess they did what they could, right?The cast in the movie is loaded with all-stars. Hollywood's most recent go-to hero Daniel Craig does an awesome job as Lonergan (dude, it's got ""loner"" right there in his name). Film icon Harrison Ford does better than he has in some of his other recent roles. And the supporting cast is rounded out with some wicked choices including the talented rising hottie Olivia Wilde, Sam Rockwell (one of my favorite actors and a bit underused here), and Keith Carradine. With an ensemble cast like this, everyone gets just enough story to keep the movie going with a little extra focus on Lonergan and Dolarhyde. There's a lot of little stuff going on here but the main focus is confronting the invading aliens. For whatever reason, this movie moved pretty slow for me. It's got its fun moments but the bits between the action scenes (the parts where the movie was supposed to be more ""western"") weren't interesting enough and I'd get bored at times waiting for the next battle. A lot of people have complained about the plot, more specifically the reason for the aliens' invasion. Personally, I thought it was a nice touch. A little far-fetched, but a nice touch. I hope the studios hadn't gone into this movie expecting the birth of a new franchise, because COWBOYS & ALIENS was far from the blockbuster they must've expected with Favreau at the helm. In my opinion, it was just an ""all-right"" movie that promised to be more than the premise really allowed.But heyat least it wasn't JONAH HEX.",Cowboys & Aliens
79,moviewizguy,Better Than What the Title Suggests,7,30 July 2011,"1875. New Mexico Territory. A stranger with no memory of his past stumbles into the hard desert town of Absolution. What he discovers is that the people of Absolution don't welcome strangers, and nobody makes a move on its streets unless ordered to do so by the iron-fisted Colonel Dolarhyde. It's a town that lives in fear. But Absolution is about to experience fear it can scarcely comprehend as the desolate city is attacked by marauders from the sky. Now, the stranger they rejected is their only hope for salvation. As this gunslinger slowly starts to remember who he is and where he's been, he realizes he holds a secret that could give the town a fighting chance against the alien force. -- (C) UniversalC&A has a ridiculous, B-movie premise that is executed like a serious, A-grade film, and that's a good thing. The film turns out to be fun entertainment in a SUPER 8 kind of way than a SNAKES ON A PLANE kind of way. They're both fun films but for entirely different reasons. With that being said, C&A, as dumb as it may appear to be, is actually quite good, and it's apparent a lot of hard work went into the film. The film manages to blend the western and sci-fi genres together better than one might expect, but with director Jon Favreau in the chair, it's also not that surprising. I'm also glad to say the trailer manages not to reveal any major plot points that happen in the film, most of it coming from the film's first 30 minutes, which is refreshing considering the trend of where most film trailers have been going.However, I'm surprised to say C&A seemed more like a western WITH aliens than a mix of two genres, which I'm pretty sure is how the filmmakers managed to pull off what they did. It didn't seem like a full fledged sci-fi flick until the climax. Still, lovers of both genres will not be disappointed. It's also great to see some thought put into the story than your usual mindless summer flick. Another thing that you might not expect from a film with a ridiculous title like this is that the characters are fleshed out enough to care for them. Even the supporting characters have their own little character arcs going on, and let me tell you, there are a lot of supporting characters. While that may sound bad, Favreau manages to balance them out really well.I also liked the action sequences as well. Seeing alien attacks mixed with old fashion western horse chases was refreshing and exhilarating to watch. The alien design itself reminded me of the creature in SUPER 8, so it wasn't really anything new but I didn't mind it. The soundtrack by Harry Gregson-Williams is refreshing, with a mix of western and modern, orchestral film scores.The success of the film also comes from the terrific cast. Daniel Craig continues to prove to be charming in any role he's in, and pulls off a convincing Southern accent. Even Harrison Ford is great in his role, who doesn't seem outdated at all. However, Olivia Wilde could have done more in her role. She seemed restricted and could have expand her performance a bit. I really liked seeing Sam Rockwell playing your average Joe with big dreams, similar to his character in MOON. Noah Ringer improved his ability to act when he was last seen in THE LAST AIRBENDER, but then again, he is a Texan at heart. As for Paul Dano, blink and you'll probably miss him, although he does provide some good laughs.Overall, C&A is an entertaining romp. Unlike the premise suggests, the film is serious but is also genuinely funny when it needs to be. The cast is great and the action scenes are well done and not overdone, if I might add. While it's not as fantastic as Favreau's IRON MAN, it could have ended up a lot worse in the wrong hands. Give C&A the benefit of the doubt, because it is a good film.",Cowboys & Aliens

And, what do they want from earth?I think the movie, back in the day with Gene Autry, in the Phantom Empire (Martians were headquartered in a mountain if memory serves) was better. And, one could consider it to have been the first Cowboy and Aliens movie. No CGI, but better. You get the flavor of a western for about 10-minutes and then the CGI with Aliens takes over and oh, humthis is going to be like Transformers..a so-so simple story, and a lot of CGI. You are not going to see a lot of acting in here. You will see and hear a lot of explosions, Alien planes flying in and around everything blowing things up and people running, running, running. Wait, wait, they have Indians in here too. Almost forgot. Can't have a western without Indians, now can we?I noticed they had about 6-screenwriters for this and I wonder what they all did. It's a mystery. Now, what would have helped? Some good lines, a little humor injected here and there and more dialogue with all these big stars. Hey, they had about 6-screenwriters and they did nothing along these lines. Nothing. The other big mystery was why did the Aliens attach the bracelet onto Jake. If there was an explanation for that I missed it. Yes, the bracelet was a weapon of sorts. So why would Aliens put a weapon on Jake and was that intentional or one of those Alien Ooops moments? Hey, we all have them.The Aliens, laid off from the TV show Battlestar Galactica, had some bulk added to them to them and for some reason we saw hands that came out of their bodies when they got close to their prey, and no one is sure what that was all about. But, it was creative. Maybe that's what those screenwriters did. HmmmmHere's something for you to chew on. Harrison Ford is cattleman Dolarhyde and is depicted as a not likable, tough, mean person. In my opinion, Ford has tougher and meaner moments when his character is playing a good guy in other movies. He should not be made to play a bad guy because we won't believe it. Looks forced. I wanted to see this in a bad way, but the CGI killed it all and oh, hum, here we go again! Oh, the acting was okay, not great. Why all the A class stars? The title alone would have pulled people in. You know I would be there. All in all very disappointing. Bummer. 5/10.Violence: Yes.

Sure, it was a bit po-faced - especially given the title - but I got over that once the tone of the film had been established. The Western isn't a genre one usually goes to for knockabout romps, and this is a straight version that just happens to have aliens in it.Westerns are built on archetypes. Rarely are they character driven. This one occasionally stuck a bit too close to the lines, but it's fine if you grasp the mood early.Maybe first choice Robert Downey Jr. would've had a bit more fun in the lead role, but Daniel Craig is all business and no frivolity...

82,dunmore_ego,A shallow ripple in the Force.,5,6 January 2012,"Is COWBOYS AND ALIENS a boring western movie, or a clichéd alien invasion movie? At some point, I wondered whether it was just a tax write-off for Stephen Spielberg, who seems to have phoned in his producer's credit on this one. At least he hired Han Solo.A cowboy (Daniel Craig) awakes in the desert with no memory and a futuristic bracelet attached to his wrist, which turns out to be a supercool weapon. A classic Eastwood-ian laconic avenger, this Stranger wanders into the nearest town, which is run by a mean-tempered rancher named Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford playing nasty). As the Stranger is run into jail, a strange anorexic woman with catlike eyes, a nice ass and an ironing board chest (Olivia Wilde) skulks around him and makes portentous remarks.Then aliens attack. Sounds dumb. Plays dumber. At one point, we almost wish that the movie would just remain a good old-fashioned Western, as the production values are top-notch, and fine actors like Sam Rockwell, Clancy Brown and Paul Dano are creating memorable, dirt-smeared roles. When mosquito-like extraterrestrial alien ships swoop down and start grabbing people and blowing things up, the tone is meant to shift to fun and action, instead shifting to stupid and eyestrain.(Note that even though the Stranger has that snappy arm-weapon, Han Solo is the first person to start firing back at the aliens! ""Give me a good blaster any day..."") Dolarhyde (great name, huh?) and the Stranger team up to lead a posse to rescue the snatched townsfolk from the aliens, who have parked their big cigar-like spaceship in the desert and are mining gold.Like INDEPENDENCE DAY or STAR WARS, the writers' lack of imagination for the aliens' battle tactics is astounding: the extraterrestrials have those fancy laser arm-weapons (one of which was stolen by the Stranger), yet when the cowboys attack their ship, what do they do? Run outside naked and start punching everyone.There are two good aspects to this poorly thought-out art experiment. One is the CGI. Far be it from me to praise CGI as a defining factor of a movie's quality, but I only mention the Computer Graphics as a comment on the state of the art; the CGI extraterrestrial aliens (which resemble the DISTRICT 9 aliens - no points for originality) are completely IN the movie. There is no doubt at all that we are looking at anything but rampaging extraterrestrial marauders that fully interact with people and horses and the landscape. On the other hand, they are purely used as 'device' - no characterization, no depth, just faceless, nameless things that the humans must overcome.The other powerful aspect of this film is the emotional connection that gradually grows between Dolarhyde and the young Native American Nat (Adam Beach - watch that boy! Oscars in his future!). When Dolarhyde eventually realizes Nat is the surrogate son he wished he had, special effects have already killed him - and through our tears we realize why the great Harrison Ford was chosen as Dolarhyde. Not just for the wealth of Han Solo gags - only Ford could begin as an unsympathetic, cantankerous villain and arc to touching his long-buried heart with such tear-welling effect. Making us weep like Ewoks.From the comicbook by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg and directed by Jon Favreau, with enough screenwriters to guarantee it was going to be a circle jerk, the mashup of genres in COWBOYS AND ALIENS is almost as dissonant as the same mashup involving aliens in INDIANA JONES AND THE KINGDOM OF THE CRYSTAL SKULL.Apparently, the overwhelming number of INDIANA JONES fans leaving that movie weeping in outrage was not enough to deter Spielberg from trying to ""alien""-ate us again...",Cowboys & Aliens
83,oneguyrambling,It has both cowboys and aliens - but precious little actual entertainment.,5,27 January 2012,"There are some times that I can see the future so clearly that I swear I am at least partially psychic. For example, next Monday thousands of co-workers will answer the question ""You saw Cowboys and Aliens huh? What was it like?"" with the following pithy quip; ""Well it had cowboys and aliens"" Ahhh that's the good stuff.And there'll be the mutual 'good one' chuckle which will quickly tail off, followed by the watcher hoping against hope that a more detailed description is required.Because there really isn't one. Because Cowboys and Aliens is a far easier product to sell than it is to watch. I mean Indiana Jones and 007 facing off against a bunch of nefarious ETs? I'm finding it hard to go to sleep with this perpetually raging nerd-on.But now I've watched it and can think of not one scene, moment or idea that was even vaguely creative aside from the aforementioned casting and title, meaning Cowboys and Aliens is everything you expect, only somehow much less.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Jake (Daniel Craig) awakens in the blistering desert sun, bleeding, bedraggled and bangled, as affixed to his arm is some otherworldly 'Leela from Futurama' like contraption. But that isn't so important right now, as Jake not only doesn't know what the thing on his arm is, he doesn't recall exactly who he is.Shortly after though he comes across three rogues hell bent on doing him harm, and he swiftly proves to the trio – and himself – that he is at least not someone to be messed with casually.With this knowledge – and a spiffy new black cowboy hat that was filthy only seconds earlier – Jake moseys into the town of Absolution.Jake quickly gains notoriety after a run-in with the son of a local big-wig, finding attention he wants no part of. He decides to head to the saloon and drink his memory back, however his newfound local fame has spread and he is recognised as Jake Delaporte, a wanted man with a price on his head.Fast forward a few moments and we meet Woodrow Dollarhyde (Harrison Ford), the local big-wig cattle man whose son Jake wronged, but before they can wait for High Noon to sort things out in the main street CONTACT! Right, cowboy part over. After an unforeseen air-raid of sorts that sees many locals lassoed away to places unknown, a tenuous alliance between some of the remaining locals including Jake and Dollarhyde is formed, and the group head off on horseback for a totally non-remarkable final hour.The locals see Jake's wrist accoutrement and assume he must be an insider, they want answers, Jake insists he knows nuthink and he wants answers himself, and pretty random chickie Alice seems to know a lot more than everyone else, yet every time she preps to give Jake the skinny he wanders off. Maybe he just isn't that desperate to get to the truth? Anyway the final hour sees Jake learn about his past and the bracelet, everyone learns more about Dollarhyde than he cares for, and quite a deal more information arises about Alice. There is a section that is cowboys and naughty cowboys, another which is cowboys and Indians, and finally the payoff cowboys (and Indians) and aliens.For what it's worth the aliens look way too big for their ships, and I had them pegged as a bit (H.R. Giger) Alien, a big Kuarto and a bit Predator.Harrison Ford does little but purse his lips and wonder if this is really better than Indy 5 (it is) in more a supporting role than a headliner, Daniel Craig similarly broods a lot and when he does manage to spit out a couple lines sounds exactly like Buffalo Bill from the Silence of the Lambs, and Olivia Wilde sure is pretty in a role that in short confused the hell out of me.And Sam Rockwell is in it. Though now hours after watching the film I can't think of why that might be important.Cowboys and Aliens is vaguely entertaining and totally disposable, it has nothing that will be referenced, copied or discussed in years to come, not even spoofed in one of those lousy Epic/Disaster/Date movie moron efforts. Now that it is here it is simply one of countless films that exist, unremarkably so.Final Rating – 5 / 10. Cowboys and Aliens is here. It will make a lot of money for a lot of people, then will be swiftly forgotten. Daniel Craig will still be 007. Harrison Ford will still be Indiana Jones or Han Solo. Jon Favreau will still be the guy who made Iron Man.",Cowboys & Aliens
84,inspectors71,Clichés & Derivations,6,9 April 2014,"Jon Favreau's Cowboys & Aliens isn't a great movie by any stretch of the imagination, but his mixture of what Roger Ebert called ""the most cockamamie plot in recent memory""--that of a group of cowboys, criminals, and Indians joining forces to defend Earth against an invasion of nasty, extra-terrestrial gold miners--with the sturdy hands of Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and Olivia Wilde makes for a cheerful waste of two plus hours on TV. Maybe the best compliment I can give C&A is that I watched it last night with the lights off (to reduce the glare) and I eventually had to turn them back on because this goofy, mediocre-in-so-many-ways, cockamamie monster flick was starting to get to me. Yet, I am irritated with Steven Spielberg for producing a movie that has too many similarities with his tedious War of the Worlds (and the aliens here are big, nasty critters that move like the concrete-come-to-life, horned, glowing-eyed dog-thingies in Ghostbusters). There are enough clichés and derived bits from other monster-movies to give you a weird, slight sense of deja vu. But I quibble.

The movie itself was marketed like that but Cowboy & Aliens was a decent movie with one or two exciting scenes which was good enough for a one time watch. That's it.The Story :- The film starts with Jake (Daniel Craig) waking up from a sleep with an armor on his left hand. He has no clue as to how he got into this and his where about . To find the clue , he reaches a town where he meets (Olivia) . She also trying to seek the truth and questions him. All of sudden , the town comes under attack by bunch of alien spaceships. What follows next is series of kidnappings by aliens. Jake and other people of the town indulges in the counter attack .Harison Ford's son is also abducted in the process and everybody in the town blames Jake for the attack. What follows next is how the people along with Jake fight with aliens and retrieves the people of the town. The review When I first saw the trailer of the movie , I was kind of dissatisfied with it. The trailer itself did not have the spark in it. Since Jon Farveau( director of Ironman) was behind the director's seat , I had some hope left for the film. So the movie was just a decent with nothing new to offer. The concept of Cowboys fighting off with aliens did not excited me at all. The story was just about OK. The direction was feeble. The performances were average. Since this was a sci-fi flick, one expects ample of visual effects to be used but hardly it is worthwhile . Overall, the movie is only a one –time watch.

86,napierslogs,Action heroes versus cowboys and aliens where thinking is not allowed,2,29 July 2011,"""Cowboys & Aliens"" is actually just Daniel Craig versus cowboys and aliens. It's very handy that he has an alien countdown timer bracelet on his wrist that doubles as a special alien killing machine. It works better than guns and knives which is all that real cowboys have. But Jake Lonergan (Craig) doesn't know how he got that bracelet, or what his name is, or who he is. He does know English.It's lucky for us that he knows English because at every break in the action he can utter every cliché line imaginable — but then again, what action movie is complete without ""Let's get outta here!"" being said at least once? The horrendous dialogue gives way to Indians speaking a made up language and disgusting aliens who don't speak but prod at you with three gooey fingers.The aliens are here to discover our weaknesses. Although we, as human beings (and especially the cowboys that are passed off as human beings in Hollywood movies), have a lot of weaknesses, at no point is there an examination of our weaknesses or how the aliens are going to exploit them. Obviously it was just said because that is what is supposed to be said in an alien movie.The mystery surrounding Daniel Craig's character in the beginning is then completely solved with a simple flashback soon after. I think at the 30 minute mark after we had a big battle between the cowboys and the aliens, the filmmakers then realized that Hollywood movies are supposed to be two hours long. So they then started a new nonsense story. This time surrounding Olivia Wilde's character since the target audience would rather see her naked than Daniel Craig. But just kidding, it's PG-13, there's no nudity.""Cowboys & Aliens"" is a mix of western, science fiction and action, and you'll just have to watch to find out how they add vampires to that mix. No popular movie is complete without them. Olivia Wilde's character tells us the secret on how to view this, ""you have to stop thinking."" Literally. But why should I have to?",Cowboys & Aliens
87,TheUnknown837-1,"A good time is what I expected from this movie and, thank heaven, a good time is precisely what I got.",7,13 August 2011,"In the year 2011, a picture like Jon Favreau's ""Cowboys & Aliens"" is both a rush of excitement and a sigh of relief. Excitement because it is taut, pumped full of spectacle and adrenaline (and very exciting) and a relief because it comes in the third quarter of a year where a lot of the movies have been either total duds or instantly forgettable swashbucklers. Admittedly, it is very nearly as silly as a lot of the movies I have dismissed in recent months (a la ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon,"" ""Red Riding Hood,"" ""Green Lantern,"" ""Season of the Witch"") but it plays it intrinsically ludicrous elements to the hilt and yet still produces a spectacle out of it.And let's face it, if there is a man in today's cinematic realm who can make great spectacle on the screen, it is Jon Favreau, who recently made the two enormously commoving ""Iron Man"" pictures. Mr. Favreau has produced a very notable career in the past few years bringing comic books to the silver screen and he does that again here, this time adapting Scott Mitchell Rosenburg's pulp tale. I am unfamiliar with the original comic book, but the film is a wild mash-up of my two favorite genres, the science-fiction spectacle and the Western. As it opens, an man (Daniel Craig) finds himself stranded in the middle of the Old West with a cauterized wound on his abdomen, an iron contraption strapped to his wrist, and a mind plagued by amnesia. After tangling with some gritty swashbucklers in the middle of nowhere, he finds himself in a dusty cow town run by - what else? - a wealthy cattle baron, played by Harrison Ford. When both Mr. Craig and Mr. Ford's character's son are jailed by the local sheriff, a group of extra-terrestrial warships wreak havoc upon the town, in which Mr. Craig learns that the device attached to his arm is in fact an alien weapon. Several locals are captured by the alien warships and soon a posse of many mismatched individuals is formed and ""Cowboys & Aliens"" becomes a rowdy posse picture, with the baddies being slimy aliens instead of scruffy bank robbers.Sure, ""Cowboys & Aliens"" is goofy, about as much as its silly title would lead you to believe. No offense meant to the comic book devotees, but how can you stage a story with gunslingers and aliens without some form of intrinsic lunacy? Mr. Favreau recognizes that and wisely, as he has in the past, incorporates wonderful touches of comedy into his more rough, straight-mannered bursts of kinetic action. The movie's got the same sort of dry humor as his ""Iron Man"" pictures and some of the same supporting cast and the results are effective. It's a modern touch of action movies to go for laughs amidst rushes of violence, but here's a moment where I actually did chuckle or even laugh out loud. And as an action picture, Mr. Favreau's talents do not disappoint or lag. Wisely moderating his usage of wide shots and closer angles and almost always keeping the camera moving (but not at a dizzying, out-of-focus speed), his combat scenes between the cowboys and aliens are dazzling in their own way, even if they are very much the same thing over and over again.Exciting as it is, ""Cowboys & Aliens"" is hardly perfect. It is dramatically uneven, with its down-to-earth human elements hardly as enjoyable as the comic touches. I found it very hard to believe in many of the dynamics between the characters. The plot also becomes, especially in regards to the character played by Olivia Wilde, a little too complicated, I think, for it's own good. But those are dismissible flaws for a silly action spectacle like this. The only real nitpick that I have about the picture is the lack of raw power in its villains. Thanks to the talents of the cast, the cowboys hold their own but the aliens are underwritten and not given enough attention to really hold their own. In addition, their computer generated imagery seems a little quirky and unfinished.So what if it is not a masterpiece? I was not really expecting great character study from a movie based on a comic book called ""Cowboys & Aliens."" A good time is what I expected from this movie and, thank heaven, a good time is precisely what I got. In regards to the cast, Mr. Craig and Mr. Ford are their usual selves: charismatic and dominant over their scenes. Supporting parts are played quite well by Sam Rockwell as a nervous saloon keeper, Olivia Wilde as a mysterious girl in town, Paul Dano as the cattle baron's high-on-himself son, and Noan Ringer (improving from his performance in ""The Last Airbender"") as the stereotypical lost little boy just wanting a father figure.Footnote for my fellow Western fans: keep an eye out for a familiar old face, to be found in the very beginning.",Cowboys & Aliens
88,thekarmicnomad,A rubbish title for such a good movie.. Wait.... oh no it isn't,3,26 November 2011,"I didn't expect much from this movie but it sounded like good light-hearted fun. From the start you are met by great performances, an intriguing story and great action. Harrison Ford is at home as a cantankerous land owner and Craig does what he does best (acts hard and takes a good kicking)Some advice. When they go after the aliens stop watching and make up your own ending. With some imagination you will feel like you have seen a great movie.Because from then on it feels like a Hollywood executive has walked past the set and thought 'hey maybe I can help with this.'. Everything that is rubbish about Hollywood alien invasion movies is hurriedly condensed into a few minutes of puke-inducing sentimentality. In the middle of battle everything stops so issues are resolved, unrequented love settled, bridges built to span mistrust and racism. I expected General Custer and Sitting Bull to run on and start high-fiving. Then battle resumes with new vigour and all of a sudden the previously bullet-proof aliens are felled with sticks and stones.If you don't take my advice and switch off early make sure you have a bucket to hand.",Cowboys & Aliens
89,MrGKB,Saved by its geek value...,4,7 February 2012,"...and I don't think I need to explain that all too much, but director Jon ""I can do it all"" Favreau's ""Cowboys & Aliens"" has precious little to recommend it beyond the ""high""--and, yes, someone must have been--concept and some mostly nifty fx work. Oh, Matthew ""Black Swan"" Libatique swoops the camera around well enough, and catches some great Western vistas and all, and like I said, the special effects are competent, certainly up to today's exacting standards, but even with some Tinseltown heavyweights like Spielberg and Howard involved, and a cast full of brand names, ""Cowboys & Aliens"" fails both to transcend its childish comic book nature and, equally, to live up to it.Let's face it, when you get right down to it, the whole conceit of the film is the fantastical juxtaposition of two completely different genres, and for this to work, both ought to be equally strong, equally well-conceived, and sadly this is not the case with ""Cowboys & Indians"". The elements of both are noticeably formulaic (in no small part due to a decided surfeit of screenwriters involved--five, count 'em, five!), and distressingly dull, almost stupid. The acting isn't as bad as many have claimed, but none of it is anything to write home about, and at least it's accomplished without visible tongues in cheek (which might have been the better approach), but even top-notch acting, let alone serviceable, can't save a script loaded with logical inconsistencies and leaden characters. A lack of star power would have sunk this turkey without a trace, and deservedly so. In an effort to mine as much clichéd fool's gold as possible, the storyline bogs down with predictability, illogic, and lack of credibility.Apparently it didn't take a complete financial bath, but it surely deserved to. I suppose everyone involved had fun making it--yay!--but the only real fun in watching it was realizing how misconceived and silly it all was, and how far Hollywood has sunk in its efforts to stripmine every last piece of gold out of our collective childishness and lack of good sense. Much like Roland Emmerich's horrifically bad ""2012,"" this benighted film is probably best watched without sound. Definitely not recommended to any but the utterly bored and indiscriminate.",Cowboys & Aliens
90,KnightsofNi11,"Fun, but doesn't have much to offer",6,9 August 2011,"Cowboys and Aliens. What a strange title, right? It doesn't get a lot more blatant than that. You read that title and you know that there will surely be cowboys, and most definitely there will be aliens. And that is basically all that Cowboys and Aliens is. It's cowboys fighting aliens and aliens fighting cowboys. It begins with a man waking up in the desert, having no idea who he is or where he came from. There is also a strange metal bracelet attached to his wrist. He finds his way to a small town where he meets the great cast of characters this movie has to offer, such as Sam Rockwell as the town doctor, Olivia Wilde as a mysterious girl who's past is unknown, and the great Harrison Ford as the grumpy old Civil War veteran who doesn't smile once throughout the whole film. Shortly after the meet and greet, aliens attack the town and abduct many of the citizens. This initiates a journey to find the creatures who attacked the town and return the stolen people to their homes. It's a special effects laden adventure with every scene delivering more cowboys and more aliens going head to head in an ironic battle royale.As much as I want to love and cherish a film about cowboys fighting aliens, I have to be realistic. Cowboys and Aliens disappoints. It is no doubt fun, but it doesn't go much further than that. The characters aren't all that interesting, despite being portrayed by a plethora of great actors. The script leaves a lot to be desired and the story, overall, is pretty forgettable. All we are really given by this film is what the title alone promises us. There are cowboys, and there are aliens. Everything else is just sort of there. I wouldn't call this film's plot awful or nonexistent, just weak. It's nothing special and with a premise as bizarre and ironically brilliant as this, there could have been a lot more going on. There's nothing in this film that I outright hate, but I couldn't fall in love with anything either. I can't think of any other movie that pits cowboys against aliens, yet I feel like I have seen the movie Cowboys and Aliens before. It is just too bland and too much of a generic Summer blockbuster to be anything truly special.But, as I said earlier, the film does deliver two things. Cowboys... and aliens. The action scenes are a lot of fun and this film really is entertaining. It's nothing that will bewilder you or make you go, ""Wow. That was amazing,"" but it's exciting enough to be a great popcorn flick. The film's special effects are great and the creature design is fantastic. The movie gives us a great look at every detail of the aliens the special effects team of this film came up with. They are grotesque and amphibian like and the film's action utilizes the design of the creatures excellently. The ships are also designed very well with a strange scorpion-like look to them, a design which looks great against the desert. And, with that in mind, everything is more fun against an ironically strange backdrop such as the wild west. But great creature design and wildly explosive special effects will only take a movie so far, and there's not much more that Cowboys and Aliens has to deliver.It's a shame to see a movie so endlessly hyped, being advertised to the extreme, miss its goals, entirely. But that's what happens when you don't deliver the masterpiece you had made the film out to be. Sadly, Cowboys and Aliens isn't that incredible of a film at all. It's fun, sure. There are some great things about it and I don't regret seeing the film, but for the long exciting expectation game that the marketing team played, it just didn't deliver.",Cowboys & Aliens

92,Bob-45,A movie sadly needing a sense of humor.,6,4 January 2012,"Sadly, pretty much everything I see these days coming from Steven Spielberg is disappointing, and ""Cowboys and Aliens"" is no exception. As in ""Super 8,"" the most likable character spends much of the movie captured by an alien. The scripters have delivered virtually no clever one liners and the battle between the cowboys and aliens seems to go on forever, with what appears at least to be at least 10 times as many cowboys being killed as were there to fight the aliens in the first place. While Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford make terrific cowboys, the script doesn't allow for much chemistry between them. I am impressed with Daniel Craig's taciturn performance. I never would have expected Craig to make such a fine western hero. While his actions are more reminiscent of Clint Eastwood's ""Man With No Name,"" his gestures and walk reminds me more of Gary Cooper. Interestingly, for me at least, his facial structure reminds me of the great silent western star, William S. Hart.The music and photography is especially good, especially in the interior scenes in the overturned river boat. The cinematographer has made excellent use of Olivia Wilde's blue, blue eyes. It is too bad the script doesn't make better use of her character.It's also great to see Walton Goggins (""The Shield"") back in action. It's too bad his role is so one dimensional and repetitious. Sam Rockwell is especially wasted as ""Doc"". Rockwell is one of Hollywood's best character actors and I was really hoping for more from him.It would be great for Craig, Ford, Rockwell, Wilde and Keith Carridine to make a straight western, instead of this uneasy hybrid. Oh well, maybe next time.I give ""Cowboys and Aliens"" a strong ""6"".",Cowboys & Aliens
93,jon.h.ochiai,"A lot of fun, and less filling...",9,5 August 2011,"Before completely digressing, ""Cowboys & Aliens"" is a lot of fun. I enjoyed it, and you got to love the title. What is astounding about ""Cowboys & Aliens"" is its pedigree. Steven Spielberg is the Executive Producer. Ron Howard and Brian Grazer are the Producers for their Imagine Entertainment. Jon Favreau (of ""Iron Man"") is the Director. The screenwriters of ""Transformers"" and ""Star Trek"", Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, along with Mark Fergas and Hawk Ostby wrote the screenplay based on the comic book. Daniel Craig (""James Bond"") and Harrison Ford (""Indiana Jones"") are the stars. Stunning Olivia Wilde, who was the best thing about ""Tron: Legacy"" costars. The movie is genetically engineered as the summer blockbuster—you can tell all involved had a blast making this movie. Surprisingly, ""Cowboys & Aliens"" barely edged out ""The Smurfs"" in the weekend box office. Go figure.Anyway, veering back on course, ""Cowboys & Aliens"" is a great summer movie. It plays like your traditional western with vermin extraterrestrials at bay. Daniel Craig is awesome, and looks amazingly shredded. He fights with explosive martial arts style—not typically Western, and is deadly with guns as well. He wakes in the desert bearing a futuristic metallic bracelet on his forearm capable of dispatching alien spaceships at will, and vicious wound in his side. Craig is convincing as outlaw cowboy, without a trace of British accent. He even has one over Clint Eastwood's ""Man with No Name"": He doesn't remember his own. You don't mess with him either, as three scoundrels discover in the opening scene.Harrison Ford is grizzled patriarch rancher Woodrow Dolarhyde. At first glance Ford seems imprisoned in caricature. However, Ford embodies character in Dolarhyde. Dolarhyde's son Percy (clumsily arrogant Paul Dano) is aimless and constantly running afoul of the law. Percy mistakenly crosses Craig. Inevitably Woodrow and Craig's amnesiac shall intersect paths.Disoriented Craig soon encounters more trouble in town. Ella (Wilde) gazes with haunting familiarity into Craig's steel blues with her own. Wilde is the beauty with mesmerizing eyes, eliciting both transparency and mystery. She is the perfect match for Craig's brooding charisma and physicality. During a fight Ella blindsides Craig; thus, saving the lives of the town's deputies. He lands in a jail cell, next to Percy. Apparently, Craig is Jake Lonergan, who is wanted for robbery and murder. Lonergran is accused of murdering his lover Alice (beguiling Abigail Spencer). Jake's fragmented flashback reveals otherwise. Flying alien drones swoop down upon the town in dramatic display, tethering fearful citizens off into the clear night sky. Jake's bracelet unleashes a burst of energy that destroys one of the ships. Dolarhyde has questions, but knows that Jake holds the key to getting his son Percy back.So Jake, Dolarhyde, Ella, and the crew ride off in search of the Aliens. In a bizarre twist, they align with the Indian tribe, and Jake's band of outlaws. No nonsense Ella holds the secret to Jake identity, and the grand alien scheme. Disappointingly, Ella gets almost naked in the integral plot point, as misrepresented by the movie trailer. After all Craig bares his ripped torso throughout—fair is fair? Craig, Wilde, and Ford captivate us; even when it ominously seems ""Cowboys & Aliens"" is going all ""Predator"" on us, particularly as the hulking aliens hunt down the humans. I really didn't want to hear Jake say, ""If it bleeds, we can kill it."" ""Cowboys & Aliens"" leverages some quirky narrative twists. The intent of the Alien invasion is a little weird and in context, along with the bewildering abductions. Really this doesn't matter. You have spectacular cinematography of the panoramic desert and mountains. Jake rescues Ella from a soaring drone, before diving into the river. The action is expertly executed. The visuals are exquisite. Enjoy the ride. Perhaps ""Cowboys & Aliens 2""?",Cowboys & Aliens

""Cowboys and Aliens"" is actually a bit better than I expected, and I'm not even that big a fan of cowboys or science fiction movies. Daniel Craig plays an amnesiac cowboy with a strange object on his arm. He's basically ""The Man With No Name,"" the gunslinger with no past and no future. Shortly after he appears in town, strange crafts appear in town blowing things up and abducting a lot of people. All Craig knows is that somehow he's the solution to the problem. Harrison Ford plays against type as the local crime boss, and Clancy Brown is the local priest. They believe the creatures are ""demons"" and start fighting back. John Favreau directs the movie seriously. The special effects are stunning; it's next to impossible to tell where the real scenes start and the FX takes over. The aliens are impressive too. Everything seems to be accurate to the period (except for the aliens), and the script moves along briskly without pausing to explain anything or add any extraneous details like the movies on SyFy channel.

All at once, I had pretty low expectations after I got the DVD last week on my 18th birthday. Two weeks later, when I watched the whole thing, my jaw dropped and became so amazed and it had exceeded my expectations. To my surprise, this is a surprisingly entertaining and very interesting film.Sure, the story does deviates itself from the graphic novel it was based on with a few questions that weren't explained during the Men and Woman quest to team up with the apache Indians to defeat and destroy the aliens and the Dialogue for this film can be pretty mediocre at times, but I was too busy being enthralled by the action throughout the entire film. They're flawless and captivating with some very creative ones.Of course, how can I forget about the actors? Well, to my surprise, they were entertaining and a lot of fun. Especially Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford. I was like, ""James Bond meets Indiana Jones? Dude, that is so extremely radical!"". Even the development with the characters is exemplary at it's best along with the romantic relationship with Daniel Craig and Olivia Wilde (who also did a great job as Ella Swenson). To those who think that it's blend of both the Western and Science Fiction genres was distracting are dead wrong because I happen to like it's blend of western and science fiction that makes this film very interesting to watch.This movie has everything else that made this movie looked good including the perfect visuals, the groundbreaking CGI effects on the aliens, the excellent make up for the alien, the extraordinary costume designs and sets, and the riveting music score from Harry Gregson Williams.

97,witster18,Obviously Amnesia Cures Bad Attitudes,5,9 January 2012,"The biggest problem I have with this film - we don't care for any of the characters.The beginning of the film presents us with two unlikable leads, and then asks us to care about them because they can't remember who they were, or because of their new-found plight.This film is already at a disadvantage combining two genre's that rarely get combined(especially with any success). And in those terms, the movie really isn't all that bad. The effects are pretty nice, and the film goes with the flow and ends a lot stronger than it begins. CHeck out ""Burrowers"" for another ""average"" cross-genre film that is similar to this - only it's better and has virtually no budget or big name actors. Same goes for ""Purgatory"".There's a love interest subplot that also lacks punch because Craig plays a guy that just lost his 'real' love interest; not to mention the new love interest isn't who we think she is(which presents a whole different problem for the relationship between the two).The action and Daniel Craig do their best to ""save the day"" with the audience and the characters' friends and family, but in the end, the audience gets left in the dark.Aliens attacking the wild west is way down the list of unbelievable plot situations here, and that's obviously not a good thing.You MIGHT like this if you liked:Jonah Hex(better), The Day the Earth Stood Still(remake/better), and Purgatory(better).48/100I didn't expect the storyline to be complex, but the script does a really terrible job of molding the characters.

98,jdkraus,Solid Story+Deep Characters=Blockbuster Success!,9,30 July 2011,"""Cowboys and Aliens."" Really? Has Hollywood run out of ideas? Sounds as terrible as ""Aliens Vs. Predator"" or even ""Snakes on a Plane."" Only an immature adolescent would come up with such an idea. Believe it or not though, ""Cowboys and Aliens"" is an excellent film. The film opens with John Lonergan (Daniel Craig), who is stranded in the Wild West. He has a mysterious bracelet attached to his wrist and has no recollection of who he is or what has happened to him. After a series of run-ins with unsavory characters, he comes to a town called Absolution. He encounters the mysterious and sexy Elle (Olivia Wilde) and the tough, no-nonsense Colonel Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford). Within minutes, the town is savagely attacked by flying machines that capture and kill several of the town's citizens. The trio makes an unlikely alliance, and ride out to find their townspeople. Unlike many pictures nowadays, the screenwriters and actors are able to make the viewers suspend their disbelief and engulf them with a solid story and deep characters. We know the story is absurd and unrealistic, but it is pretty straightforward and even plausible. My eyes were glued to the screen for the whole two hours. And when characters die (in which several do), the actors are able to emote the sorrow and remorse and the viewers want them to be avenged. There are also plenty of jump moments to keep the suspense going throughout the feature.Having mentioned that the actors are great, they are perfect. Each embodies a character of the old west. Craig is like Clint's the ""Man with no Name"". He's a mystery and we don't know his whole story (until later in the film). What we do know early on is that he can handle both his fists and his weapons well. Ford is the gruff, tough hero, similar to the old John Wayne. He's not only a rough fighter, but he has to do things his way and does not tolerate others. There is even a pistol wielding drunk, a man with gold teeth, a bartender who can't shoot worth a darn, Indians, including one who know how to track, and a preacher who is not afraid to carry a rifle. Olivia Wilde, however, is not the typical damsel in distress. There is a twist about her character in the middle of the feature that I did not see coming. This fits flawlessly into the story's structure. The cinematography is a real treat. Many of the shot compositions that are used is a throwback to the old westerns—beautiful wide shots of epic landscapes. I also like how careful the angles and shots were used when the aliens were first introduced; it holds their physical identity as a mystery for the first 40 minutes or so of the movie. It's worth noting though that the lighting in the attack of the town Absolution is very dim, which makes it difficult to see what's happening on screen. Then again, it would be hard to see at night, specifically when under attack by aliens in spaceships. The animation is pretty good, but I was little disappointed in the creature design of the aliens. They reminded me too much of the alien in J.J. Abrams ""Super 8"". It works though, for the aliens look monstrous and are huge— this makes them perfect bad guys.The choreography of the fight scenes between humans and humans against aliens are very impressive. The director does not shy away from bloody injuries and wounds that both humans and aliens sustain from fighting. There are even scenes where aliens eat and beat humans to death right in front of the camera. Though a PG-13, this is not a kid's movie. If it were any worse, this movie would have been a hard R. It is a rare feat for a big-budget movie to have both a good story and characters worth caring for. ""Cowboys and Aliens"" pulls this off with finesse and brings a new look of the western genre to the table. It's not about men in white hats squaring off with men in black hats, but men on horses up against the monstrous beyond.",Cowboys & Aliens

101,Likes_Ninjas90,What Iron Man director Jon Favreau brings to this comic book adaptation is texture,7,11 August 2011,"In the Old West, a mysterious man (Daniel Craig) wakes up not knowing who or where he is. He's been wounded in the stomach and has a mysterious metal bracelet attached to his arm that he can't break off. After he escapes a group of bandits he rides back into town to heal up. But he brings attention to himself by taking out a thug named Percy (Paul Dano). Suddenly, people recognise the man as an outlaw named Jake Lonergan and he is knocked out by the mysterious Ella Swenson (Olivia Wilde) and winds up in a cell right next to Percy. When army Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) learns that his son Percy has been locked up, he rides into town with his men to free him. But the town is attacked by alien spaceships, which capture by people by roping them up into their crafts. One of the people taken is the wife of bartender Doc (Sam Rockwell). When it's noted that Jack's bracelet can shoot down the ships, Woodrow insists that he comes with the group including Ella, Doc and Nat (Adam Beach), an Indian, to try and get their friends back. I'd be lying if I said I didn't enjoy Cowboys and Aliens. It's a ridiculous concept, melding the Western with science fiction and not one with any recent or memorable comparison. But importantly, what Iron Man (2008) director Jon Favreau brings to this comic book adaptation is texture. It surprised me what a violent and grubby film this is. That means that it's not appropriate for small children but it does make for a more grounded Western. Out of all the ways to describe a movie called Cowboys and Aliens, I never imagined I'd be using the word 'realistic'. But believe it or not, the characters in this film look and feel like real cowboys, hardened battlers of the frontier. Many of them are unshaven; they drink too much and engage briefly in torture. In one scene a man is tied to two horses as his limbs are pulled in two different directions. Even the early brawls in this film are more involving and intense than we usually expect from films like this because they're shot cohesively and with some gravity. The cuts and the bruises here look real. I appreciated the attention to detail that Favreau decided to bring to this movie, instead of easy self- referencing. Any humour in this film arrives in just the right amount of doses. It never becomes a winking parody because the mood of this film and the performances play the concept straight. This allows the deadpan humour to come through more naturally, mostly thanks to some fun supporting roles by Sam Rockwell and briefly Paul Dano. They seem to be having great fun with some of their dialogue and they're really enjoyable to watch and listen to. But the casting of Craig is particularly interesting. Robert Downey Jr. was originally was attached to the film because of the success he and Favreau shared with Iron Man. But Craig is, I think, a better fit for the movie. His weathered face and constant grimace evokes Clint Eastwood's Man with No Name. He doesn't bring any of the smugness that Downey Jr. would have. That means that there's less jabs and winking at the source material. Instead, Craig makes himself effortlessly cool by snarling lines like: ""Demons took your gold. When you get to hell, you can ask for it back"". Harrison Ford is in grizzled form here and really chews the scenery as the battle hardened Colonel. There is a little more depth and warmth to his character, because of his interactions with Nat, while thankfully avoiding much of the schmaltz of Super 8 from earlier this year. Olivia Wilde is merely serviceable but at least slightly more active than most female roles in movies like this. These characters aren't as rich or romantic as the ones from Iron Man but they're tough and humorous enough to be a lot of fun. The aliens are the least interesting part of the movie. This is where the film loses a lot of its gravity. There's nothing particularly unique or interesting about the aliens. They have few weaknesses and not much personality. They're just after gold. And not having read the comic book, I don't know if the aliens are meant to be symbolic or allegorical. Favreau is not interested in that aspect. Some of their sequences have a few jumpy scares, which does add to the fun but others are just overdone or too far-fetched. If you think the aliens are a stretch, wait till you reach the Indian campfire ceremony. There's also a silly scene on top of a spacecraft and the last battle, like so many of these films, goes on far too long. That said, the action is very slickly handled and violent and the actors are engaging. I think a lot of comic book and video game fans are going to love this film.",Cowboys & Aliens
102,Dan1863Sickles,Spectacular Action and Great Performances,7,3 August 2020,"This movie is a lot of fun but very hard to rate. There are scenes that are spectacular, like the opening sequence where Jake awakens naked in the desert and has to fight off some very bad men. There are scenes that make you cringe, like every time Paul Dano opens his mouth. There are great performances and terrible performances. There are funny lines and lines that make you want to punch someone. There are great special effects and there are really bad special effects. The worst part of the movie is the middle, which drags on forever. The beginning is absolutely great and the end is pretty much okay.This is the kind of movie you should only watch on DVD. Just watch the opening credits, the fight scene, and the attack on the town. Then fast forward to the last twenty minutes. Everything in between is pretty terrible, except that Harrison Ford is surprisingly intense as Colonel D. He acts like he's in a real Western!",Cowboys & Aliens
103,qormi,"Okay, it kept you going.",5,9 March 2013,"I'll give it 5 stars because its western scenario was realistic - the dirt, grime, dimly lit bars..remember the phony bright lights inside the saloons of those 60's westerns? The movie had a decent plot and Daniel Craig carried off the lead role well. Harrison Ford was good, too. It all boils down to implausibility. The aliens had weapons, but chose to fight the humans by tackling them in the climactic battle. That's because they underestimated humans, I guess. The part where someone is really an alien in human form was wretchedly stupid. The aliens were too grotesque to be intelligent beings....they ran like cheetahs, were built like gorillas, had crablike faces, sticky arms that popped out of their intestines...c'mon, guys. And an outlaw gang with 30 members??? Ten would be pushing it, don't you think?",Cowboys & Aliens
104,griffolyon12,Wanna see Cowboys fighting Aliens? Then this is your movie!,8,6 August 2011,"There are certain movies where the title gives them away, and Cowboys & Aliens is one such movie. A cowboy with no name, and actually no memory, arrives in the small Western town of Absolution, which is the theme of the entire movie. The cowboy, played by Daniel Craig, obviously has a dark past, one that he wants to be absolved of, though it is tough to be absolved for one's sins when demons (a.k.a. aliens) attack the small Western town and abduct the town's inhabitants. Cowboys & Aliens is an odd sort of mash up of two clashing genres (Sci-Fi and Western), but it actually works to create fun action set pieces, and the credibility comes in the fact that the aliens are never called aliens but are often referred to as demons (of course, us from the 21st Century know what they are). The movie co-stars Harrison Ford as a gruff old rancher, not all that likable, and ultimately a forgettable character, and that really sums up the whole movie. Like Daniel Craig's character, this is a very gruff, straight forward movie that just doesn't have anything fresh or intriguing enough about it to make it memorable. While we have seen these Western and Sci-Fi tropes played again and again, there is a cheap thrill that comes in seeing these things come together in the entertaining action sequences shot by director Jon Favreau, but the thrill doesn't linger.I give Cowboys & Aliens an 8 out of 10!",Cowboys & Aliens

The combining of those two genres could've gone very cartoonish but Jon Favreau did a good job with it. For example a director who did a bad job of this is Barry Sonnenfeld in the atrocious Wild Wild West.The movie has a strong pair of leading men with Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford, basically teaming up of James Bond and Indiana Jones if you will. And with the always great Sam Rockwell in a supporting role and Paul Dano who's a good rising actor in his own right.",Cowboys & Aliens
106,Mr_Sensitive,Like a tiger without its claw,3,16 November 2012,"At first I didn't believe other reviewer. How bad can it be as I was thinking to myself. Well, now they can count me in. This movie is a total mess!! I think this is one of the most disappointing movies of the year.Synopsis: After being attack by the UFO, a group of cowboys are after the alien in search of rescue their love one that the alien took.It all starts with the script that is a total mess. The story itself has a potential to be a decent action movie instead they opted for something 5 years old could watch and has omitted everything good for fear that it might scare children. Like a tiger without its claw, this movie is no fun. The dialogue is just weird (No way cowboy speak this way), and everyone talk, walk and moving about without any passion. There is no character development at all. The story is just unacceptable - almost seem like 12 years old wrote it. Seriously this is written by 7 screen writer? Really disappointed with Jon Favreau. His movie till date has been more or less watchable and more or less entertaining. But this is just bad. Like he never read the script before he did this movie.I think the casting was the main attraction for this movie. They somehow managed to get many A lister to be in this movie. All of them fail. Don't want to get into detail, but with so ridiculous character even A list seem like an amateur. Harrison Ford character is just sad!!! He was beyond awful.Overall the only good thing about this movie is its very catchy name. Yeah that is about it. The movie runs for almost 2 hours and they can't even put in anything good into it.Recommendation: skip it. seriously!! Rating: 3/10",Cowboys & Aliens
107,Laakbaar,Under-rated,8,4 August 2015,"I really enjoyed this movie. (Imagine me at this point snorting derisively at those who pan this film.) Lots of action. Good story. Great character development. It's the kind of enjoyable sci-fi movie you can just get into without any effort. Just relax and hang on for the ride.The strange thing is that it is both a good western and a good sci-fi film. Favreau nails down both genres (including the clichés) and marries them. Wow. It worked.Daniel Craig is just fracking awesome as the tough-as-nails hero. Harrison Ford is great as the ornery old guy.No, it's not a perfect movie. There were a few story issues. I got particularly irritated when dozens apparently had to die to free the dozens held captive.Favreau is apparently now one of my favourite directors.",Cowboys & Aliens
108,phenomynouss,Big dumb mess,1,2 August 2011,"With a hokey name like ""Cowboys and Aliens"", you're really not supposed to expect much more than Cowboys and Aliens, fighting.And very little of the movie even deals with that.Being PG-13, it couldn't go all-out in a faithful depiction of the Old West, but it seems they only really pushed it so as to show off Olivia Wilde's buttcrack and a quick shot of a a guy with a big hole shot through the chest with an alien weapon, as everything else is virtually squeaky-clean, not a hint of racism or sexism, grit or grime, and an utterly blasè attitude from everyone but Sam Rockwell as the bartender ""Doc"".As the review in my local newspaper said, very little is devoted to ""why"" with regards to the alien, and far too much ""why"" with regards to Daniel Craig's Jake Lonergan, played so stony and cold you don't give a damn about any of his problems.The characters are horribly one-dimensional and predictable, and there were so many instances in the film where not only me, but a large group of people, burst out laughing. And not when the movie was being funny.Not going to spoil it, but the big ""revelation"" moment with Olivia Wilde's character caused some very loud and noticeable derisive laughter from many of us in the theater, and the moment with the alien that Jake had first met having a final standoff with him at the end was so hackneyed, it provoked chitters and groans.For a movie that felt so long and, by concept, seemed to be aiming for something big, it sure felt small, like a Syfy original movie with some big-name actors in it.But the absolute biggest plothole involves the aliens interacting with the people. Not only is it never explained WHY the aliens are randomly abducting people, but as it turns out, their ultimate reason for coming to Earth, and their goal, not only has little to nothing to do with humans, but considering their technology, they could EASILY achieve without EVER interacting with the humans at all! Considering how a clichè'd Hollywood flick like this ends with the good guys winning, these aliens could've saved themselves a lot of trouble by not looking to pick a fight with the natives for no reason. But then we wouldn't have this big dumb mess we call a movie.",Cowboys & Aliens

Did someone actually think this was going to be a blockbuster? I can't really think so, for I have been watching this on TV for the last hour and have absolutely no idea what it is suppose to be about. Sure, the title says it all, cowboys (sorta) and aliens (huh?), but this has no story to tie the dialog together. Who's who? I dunno...Why? I dunno...Is there a plot of any kind? Ummmmm, noooooooo...Is there action? Sometimes, but it has no meaning.OK, that's 9 lines, one more to go...My question is this...is Harrison Ford now so desperate as to take a role in a useless outing such as this just to make a few dollars????? Ugghhhh, I guess so! I mean, you have cowboys who lasso nothing...yet you have aliens lassoing townspeople from their zippy flying platforms. When we finally get a good look at the aliens, they are running around on all fours like a clan of drunken chimpanzees. And their space ship looks like someones bad imitation of steam punk. Wow, I believe it was actually riveted together!",Cowboys & Aliens
110,judywalker2,Big disappointment,5,1 August 2011,"Glad I didn't pay extra for the 1201 showing on Friday morning because Cowboys and Aliens is the biggest disappointment of the Summer. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie since it starred a few of my favorite people, Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Clancy Brown and Sam Rockwell. It was directed by Jon Favreau. I guess it's hard to translate some graphic comics to film. A history of violence did it well but Cowboys and Aliens is not humorous enough to be fun and not dark enough to be so serious. All of the actors try to do their best with the material but the dialog is so bad that it makes you cringe. Favreau should have paid more attention to older westerns instead I think he saw the recent remake of True Grit one too many times as the film reminds me of that film. The aliens were scary, whoopie. We've seen so many aliens on film we're immune. Its the cowboy story we were more interested in and that failed to live up to our expectations.One final note, I got a chance to review the synopsis of the comic book story. Like the Prince of Persia too bad the writers didn't use the original storyline which of course is much better than the mess they came up with for this movie.

Aliens as the enemy in one way or another, maybe mostly I expected them to be big and ugly, well wait till you see the flick. Lots of fighting, shooting, gunning, explosions and good action most of the way.All in all this delivers what the title states, it has humor & action and is very entertaining most of the way.",Cowboys & Aliens
112,MelbaMan1,B-Movie,4,14 April 2018,Western movie with a sci-fi twist. But still a 1950s-like B movie. Why did such top actors get involved in this? Made it to last half hour.,Cowboys & Aliens
113,moviemanMA,The wild west with a twist,7,30 July 2011,"Based on the graphic novel of the same name, Cowboys & Aliens takes us back to a post-Civil War west, similar to the west evoked in the glory days of westerns, or for you readers out there who didn't receive a healthy dose of John Wayne and John Ford, think Unforgiven. We meet a man with no memory (Daniel Craig), who we later find out is Jake Lonergan, wanted for armed robbery and murder. He doesn't know his name, where he came from, our how he ended up in the middle of the desert with a large metal cuff on his wrist. He wanders into a nearby town where he winds up getting into more trouble. He gets the attention of the sheriff and the wealthiest man in town, Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford). Ford knows Jake as the man who robbed his train. He wants to hang him up, but he won't get his wish.The town is bombarded by a wave of alien spacecraft, the kind the throw bombs and suck up victims with lights and ropes. Six-shooters and Winchester rifles do nothing but make noise. It is here that we find out the purpose of the metal cuff on Jake's arm.If you've seen the trailer you can pretty much guess what the film is about. One man, wanted for murder, is the key to the town's survival against the alien invaders, as well as the key to getting back the abducted townsfolk. Simple enough. That's what I expected and that is what I received. The only part I didn't account for was how entertained I was.I have a tendency to look past the surface of the screen, at the dialogue, camera shot selection, lighting effects, etc. Here I was more concerned about whether or not a Cowboys & Aliens toy gun like the one Craig uses would be available in time for Christmas. The movie is fairly simple but the concept is, to put it bluntly, really cool!Think about it for a second. Put yourself in the wild west of the 1870s. You're exiting a saloon and are about to mount your trusty steed. Then on the horizon a line of lights appear. Unlike anything you've seen before. Suddenly you are surrounded by lights, sounds, and explosions the likes of which you never dreamed of. The weapon you carry in your holster has been made useless. All you can do is try to survive. It's kind of frightening. These characters didn't even think about creatures from another world. They have enough issues with the Natives of the country.Favreau does a fantastic job in recreating the old west and throwing it into the middle of this utterly preposterous situation. The clothing, sets, and weapons hearken back to the days of Wyatt Earp and the O.K. Corral. Taking a genre as familiar as the west and placing it in the context of a science fiction story makes too much sense. Most science fiction stories have roots in the west. A hero versus a villain. The threat of outsiders. Foreign landscapes. Big shoot outs. The story lines cross over so much that they were bound to collide some day.The two leads of the film, Craig and Ford, or James Bond and Indiana Jones, work hand in hand, feeding off each other's sharpness. Craig has a cold, icy stare, like you don't know what he is going to do next, but he knows exactly (perfectly describes his character). Ford plays angry better than most. His scowl is legendary, and puts it to plenty of good use here. The supporting cast of Sam Rockwell, Keith Carradine, Olivia Wilde, and Adam Beach do a fine job. Nothing outstanding (except for maybe Rockwell), but still a decent job.It's not a perfect film even if it is a summer blockbuster. There were a few moments where I shook my head and asked why, but for the majority I was entertained. Action junkies will certainly get their money's worth, and best of all it comes at a 2-D price. No glasses required and no extra fee (though the price still stings a bit). It's War of the Worlds meets The Searchers. Not the best match, but one that you can handle. Enjoy.",Cowboys & Aliens

The aliens are shown so huge they could never fit into their individual spaceships. How did that happen? Oh and then there's the bleeding hear liberal message delivered by the indians.

115,michaelarmer,Hybrid Hit,7,7 March 2020,"This film is a bit of a mongrel, a hybrid and very unusual, mixing a Western with a Sci-Fi action film, and (James Bond with Han Solo) Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford are an unusual mix for the 2 leads, but it works.And if you think about it, over the millennia of time, Aliens could arrive on earth in any time period, so why not in the west in the 1800's, its as good as a time and place as any.It is a very good western, the acting is well done, and the performances credible, even Daniel Craig's american accent is not too bad, the photography is excellent, New Mexico provides the scenery, and whaaaaat scenery, beautiful. The sci-fi angle is a slightly odd fit to the film, but they manage the crossover well, and it kind of fits. The special effects are not great though, the aliens are monstrous and horrific, a bit like some others from other sci-fi horrors, and its a bit gruesome when the killing takes place, but that's the way they wanted it, it appeals to many people, not me though. The story is Ok and the screenplay is great when its a western but not as good in the sci-fi bits. The music is good.The thing that keeps it up is the pace, they keep it well interesting and the action is spot on, all in all a good movie, unusual but good.Its currently got a 6.0 average rating on here, I think it is better than that and give it a 7, if the special effects and Sci-Fi screenplay were better, I might have given it a 9.

The acting is great, no complaint about that. We know there are aliens because of the title so I'm not giving away anything there. But they are here for our gold for what reason? Why not quietly land on earth, mine the gold and leave? Why fly over a small Arizona town and bring attention to yourself? Ah, because they want to study the weakness' of the humans. I see. Another question-a cowboy wakes up without his shoes and hat but has a strange electronic bracelet on his wrist? But why? Why does he have it? So many unanswered questions.

However, to my surprise, I found a film that was paced well with plenty of suspense and action.The story was intriguing and the characters, whilst stereotypes of the western genre, were utilised well as the film keeps up the western pastiche convincingly until the reveal of the aliens. I found it to be a great first act which chose the quieter half of this genre hybrid to establish time, place and characters. It was really well done.The CGI still holds up and the action sequences were well directed. Jon Favreau, Hollywood veteran and director of the first Ironman, chose to invest in his characters rather than set-pieces and i believe that paid off. Daniel Craig's accent aside, all the actors appear to be comfortable in their roles and since their interactions make up most of this film's running time, that was important.Cowboys & Aliens is an entertaining if only slightly vacuous feeling pre-extended universe blockbuster.",Cowboys & Aliens

I haven't really seen any, the only one that I think I've seen is Back to the Future part 3, and even though I like it, that's my least favorite of the trilogy. So I went into this movie pretty much hoping the sci fi would keep my attention.Well the sci fi was by far the best part of this movie, but I still didn't really like it. For me it's way too slow and focuses much more on the western stuff than the sci fi stuff. It also took itself a little too seriously, there were some times where they lightened up, but most of the time they just seemed so down.The acting is good, even young Noah Ringer who's improved a lot since Last Airbender. But the movie just wasn't made for me, it didn't mix western and sci fi well, I didn't really care for the characters, and only some of the action scenes were exiting. If you love both sci fi and Westerns, you might really like this movie. Just not really my thing.",Cowboys & Aliens
119,nickmesafilms,Cowboys & Aliens (2011) - Cowboys + Aliens = PERFECT POPCORN ENTERTAINMENT!,7,23 December 2011,"This western sci-fi mash-up, directed by Jon Favreau, mixes two of the best genres in film, and stars two of the best leading men in cinema. The movie begins with Daniel Craig (being best known as James Bond) playing an outsider who wakes up with unexpected amnesia, with an alien device strapped to his wrist. Not knowing that aliens are invading the Old West, this outsider teams up with Harrison Ford (being best known as Indiana Jones) as a cattle rancher, and Olivia Wilde as a mysterious female accomplice, to help defeat these extra-terrestrials, and save their friends and family. The movie begins like you're in the middle of an entertaining adventure. Director Jon Favreau has done a terrific job of mixing these two classic genres, and he made it happen in such a cool way. The art direction, recreating the Old West, is beautifully ""picturesque"". The special effects showing the alien invasions are super breathtaking. But I really didn't like the way they portrayed the aliens, when they looked more like ""District 9"" aliens, instead of the classic ""E.T."" type of thing. I enjoy watching Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford play iconic roles, and the thought of watching them in a movie together is priceless. But neither of their performances were that special, but they do make the movie fun. Rounding up the supporting cast is newcomer Olivia Wilde, who is so beautiful to watch on screen with her incredible blue eyes. But she doesn't reveal any back-story to her character, it's like she has no personality. But she still does a pretty good job. Sure, this movie isn't an Oscar-worthy film, and it's not one of the best movies ever made, but it is a perfect popcorn movie. Anyways, if you are in the mood for a classic summer movie with cowboys, extra-terrestrials, pretty ladies, cool special effects, and beautiful landscapes, you will not be disappointed. ""Cowboys and Aliens"" is the perfect example of a classic popcorn summer flick. ""Cowboys and Aliens"", in my review, ""a fun adventure, classic summer entertainment"".",Cowboys & Aliens
120,dvc5159,Neat high-concept blockbuster that's very entertaining in my opinion,6,12 August 2011,"James Bond and Indiana Jones are thrown into a ""War Of The Worlds"" scenario set in the Wild West. This concept is utter nonsense at first glance, but under capable hands it can make for a very entertaining thrill ride. With a title like ""Cowboys and Aliens"", I paid to see cowboys and aliens. And that is exactly what I got.What startled me, though is that the comments and most of the critics have been unkind to this movie. Yes, it has its faults, but boring isn't one of them. But then again, one would expect a concept this ridiculous to have a light-hearted, Spielberg-like atmosphere around it. The only thing Spielbergian about this movie is the great special effects, and that's it. The western aspect is nothing new - straight out of any classic Western film, but it is executed in a similarly serious tone to that of Clint Eastwood's ""Unforgiven"" - ambiguous lead characters, some dry humor here and there (no wonder the characters and the script were thought to be ""bland"") and realistic Western settings - at least for the first third of the movie. Once the aliens start to appear things quickly shift into mindless fun territory. Yes the script has problems but what other blockbuster doesn't? (""The Dark Knight"", maybe)The action sequences and special effects are engaging, and they are handled with a lot of energy by Jon Favreau and his team. Daniel Craig makes for a convincing action hero with his accent completely unrecognizable, although Harrison Ford and Olivia Wilde's characters are somewhat underused (Craig, Ford and Favreau should make more western films, not necessarily together but that's OK too). Harry Gregson-William's score is good and does the job, but I really adore the production design/value and Matthew Libatique's great cinematography - it looks like a real Western.So in short, I got my money's worth. I think the problem is that people were expecting something light-hearted like ""Silverado"" meets ""War of the Worlds"", but got instead ""Unforgiven"". It was a risk that Favreau and the screenwriters dared to take, but the result is a unique hybrid of serious Westerns and alien invasion flicks. It's great entertainment, and people should not have any expectations and go in and watch this movie with an open mind.Overall rating: 72/100",Cowboys & Aliens
121,gary-444,A Horrible Mish Mash,3,22 July 2012,"I really wanted this to be good. A neat cross genre idea, good actors, big budget and an experienced director. But this fails. Not as a spectacle, but as a story. The $168m outlay was recouped, and some, so the money men will be happy, but none of the actors will place this high on their CV. Cowboys & Aliens pretty much sums up what is wrong with 21st century Hollywood cinema.The western location settings in New Mexico and California are sumptuous. Careful study has also been made of the ingredients of classic westerns, the opening is classic Clint Eastwood territory as the man with no name heads for Absolution. The residents are subjugated by a cattle baron and his bullying imbecilic son, and then the aliens start a bit of terror all of their own. Some of the set pieces are fine, the torture of the sole survivor of an alien attack because the cattle baron does not believe his story is plausible, as is the opening alien attack. But it soon becomes a painting by numbers exercise. The Indians , the bad guys and the good guys all join up to defeat the common enemy. The kid triumphs, and there is a dog. Dynamite is all that you need to defeat intergalactic technology, and the women have grossly underwritten roles.Forty four year old Daniel Craig, hero and man with no name flaunts his naked, finely toned torso in sexless, strangely homo-erotic style. Harrison Ford is grumpy, presumably with the script. And the women don't have a fat lot to do. The conclusion is preposterous.What the film lacks is wonder. The inhabitants of the wild west seem to pretty much take alien invasion in their stride. When the opening western based story is unfolding director Jon Favreau is pleasingly sure-footed, but he abandons all sense of reality when the aliens arrive. Having successfully handled Iron Man 1 & 2, the budget and the big production is no problem, but all sense of artistic coherence is lost. We don't care about the characters and the climax is funny, rather than dramatic.A terrible waste of quite a good idea.",Cowboys & Aliens

123,Meven_Stoffat,"John Wayne would be less than impressed with these ""cowboys""",3,29 July 2011,"I worry for Daniel Craig. It seems like it will take a lot for him to prove to the world that he's capable of doing more than playing James Bond. And furthermore, it doesn't look like he'll be any more able to pull off a performance as Mikael Blomkvist in the upcoming Dragon Tattoo remake. Because just an hour ago, I got out of the movie that may just be solid proof of his inability to act outside his comfort zone... Cowboys and Aliens. I'll admit I didn't have any expectations for this movie except just a fun and enjoyable blow-em-up alien flick. In fact, something with such a title as ""Cowboys and Aliens"" should not be boring. And a cast like Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and Olivia Wilde should help offer SOMETHING of that promise. Unfortunately, the movie has its head so far up in the clouds, it thinks it's something other than what it should be.I will say the movie got off to a good start with the opening moments, where Jake, the film's protagonist wakes in the desert, unaware of where he is, and then the following scene with Jake beating the men up and stealing their clothes and horse was great too. Speaking of the protagonist, I'm not sure why we don't find out his name until about 30 minutes into the movie, or so it seems.Anyways, back to the ""plot"". He appears to have woken up with a bracelet made of iron on his left wrist, which leads to what may be the most ham handed Chekhov's Gun example later in the film. He appears to have no memory at all and later finds out he is a wanted robber, and is imprisoned after a bar fight. One night, aliens attack the town, and it is unknown why (nor is it really explained, save for some weird gold subplot later in the film). And there's more attacks, and the men go on an adventure to stop the attacks, and blah blah blah... The end.Oh and I forgot, Olivia Wilde is in this. What she was even in there for again I'm completely empty at the thought of too, and maybe my summary wouldn't be so vague had there been STUFF HAPPENING in the film. Sad thing is, her performance is the best thing of the movie.Honestly I am amazed. I haven't had this much trouble trying to find the words to say about such a frustrating film. How could a movie with such a concept be so BORING. There is basically almost no fun in the film. When a movie is called ""Cowboys and Aliens"" and there's no fun in the movie whatsoever, that is not a good sign. In fact, why are there aliens in the movie, anyway. They are indeed very pointless and they feel forced in just to create some pointless conflict involving gold, which gets left to naught in the end. And we rarely see any of the aliens anyway. In fact, we see more spaceships than aliens. And the aliens look dumb anyways. Do they give razzies for CG? Because they look so bad, they make the aliens in Battle LA look awesome.The movie gets two of three stars for Harrison Ford and Olivia Wilde, both the best things about this film, and the third star for the beautiful Arizona locations. The rest... yawn.OVERALL: 3/10Pros: Olivia Wilde and Harrison Ford give good performances, as well as the location is great.Cons: Cowboys And Aliens is essentially a fun-less, boring, slow and plodding dirge with boring action and pointless subplots that do nothing but drag a film that should be 85 minutes to a boring 2 hours.",Cowboys & Aliens

People in the old west must overcome their personal, cultural and societal failings to work together to fight off an alien invasion.Like Battle: LA this movies tries to turn a pulp scenario into something more.However as a movie it fails because you have the Character of Jake who is a larger than life western/action hero channeling the spirit of James Bond kicking ass both alien and human. But it never succeeds as an action movie.It tries to be a rough tough western but characters are so busy being rough and tough it is hard to take them seriously.It tries to be a metaphor for colonial injustice but it fails there too.It tries to be a journey into our very nature as humans but doesn't really succeed at that.Oh, and always, the aliens have some really stupid weakness.",Cowboys & Aliens

Namely, the sci-fi elements are here to extend the range of the action and to up the challenge faced by the heroes not to set the moral core of the film. It's well paced and well shot. The cast is impeccable, in fact it's the best role I've seen of Harison Ford in a long while. and it's the best movie I've seen from Jon Favreau, despite liking his Iron Man. The man has a knack for comics adaptations, and he bested himself here (yes I know it was a graphic novel, from the movie's viewpoint it's the same thing). The only real problem I had with the film is the fact that most of the secondary roles were too ""cartoonish"" - that is flatI liked how it gathers all the elements of the western cliché to reach the movie's climax. That's what a homage is all about. And if you still have your doubts, wait for the very final scene and you'll realize too - this was a western.

128,jb_campo,"Excellent cast, unique plot, so-so sci-fi/western action",6,10 May 2014,"I just re-watched Cowboys & Aliens to see if I missed something the first time. Nope, same results - it was an OK movie.Why is this movie just OK? The casting is superb! The best part is that all the characters hit the mark - the lone cowboy/gunman (Craig), the rich landowner (Ford), the beautiful woman (Wilde), the barkeep/Doc, his foreigner wife, the bad guy gang, the sheriff, heck maybe the best performance was the Preacher, the young boy, the Indian chief. Everyone was incredibly excellent in becoming that character - very believable.The storyline maybe? No, what a unique premise. A lone cowboy in the 1800s wakes up, doesn't know who he is or how he got where he got. He rides into Absolution, what a great name, and starts fighting back against anyone who pushes against him. Daniel Craig is the perfect casting for this Bond-like character who's on his own, and boy does he like it, while struggling with his past. Then out of nowhere, Aliens appear and attack. Holy smokes - cowboys & aliens? in one movie? what a cool concept. They even capture humans and spirit them away. Where, why? And what is this thing on Craig's wrist - how did it get there? Lots of good threads that draw you along.Maybe it's the aliens then? No, they were fine, as far as aliens go. The aliens really resemble a hybrid between the Predator and Alien movie bad guys. Slimy, dark, creepy. They also seem to run like the aliens from Cloverfield did in NYC, and just as vicious.I think the failure to really win with this movie lies with the director, Jon Favreau (Iron Man). I enjoyed the IM series, but in Cowboys & Aliens, there was not enough tight choreography. The chase scene was just too long. The whole ending sequence ended up being just too long. Inside the big gold digger machine at the end - again, just too long. How many times must we again see Wilde crawling through a tunnel. OK we get it, there's a race going on.You will laugh, you will cry, this movie WILL get you emotional. But at some point, you'll be saying - come on - get on with this. Much like many Bond films have big things exploding all over at the end, like the IM #3 too, this movie does the same. Life lessons learned - can't we all just get along (Ford and Indian chief). Other lessons too about letting things go, live for the day. OK, their preaching was just about right - not too heavy handed, again, just too long.The first half of the movie - excellent. The second half - too long, but interesting enough. All told, a decent flick, with a great creative premise, and above all, excellent casting, great chemistry, solid acting. Olivia Wilde - she's cool - she will impress you.You should enjoy this entertaining flick - it's worth your time.",Cowboys & Aliens
129,eshwarmail,"Cast, premise and technology could not save the insensitivity of its handling",4,3 November 2012,"Superbly cast, excellent premise and a pathetic treatment to the said premise leaves it in a cohesive mess that never lives up to any expectations. The element of surprise for the cowboys seeing Aliens or even digesting the fact is missing as a bunch of gunslingers go about as a routine kidnapping and rescue mission. It fails both as a western and a science fiction.A man with no name (Daniel Craig) wanders into a small town in Arizona with a weird object attached to his wrist having no memory of his past. The town is in the iron grip of a powerful landlord with past military experience Colonel Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford). When the man with no name was identified to be Jake Lonergan a notorious criminal wanted by the law, an alien invasion occurs abducting many people from the town which is when everyone realizes that Jake's wrist object is the only weapon that could help them. The rest is the adventure to take the attack to the enemy and free their loved ones.Harrison Ford starts off as not being too comfortable playing the second fiddle but comes to terms as the story progresses. Daniel Craig doesn't have much talking to do and he looks mysterious throughout even after the mystery is solved. The visual effects are a little inconsistent which can be no excuse in today's times that too coming from a big studio production while the director has a past record of handling it a bit too well in the Iron Man franchise. The talented Sam Rockwell is wasted here and Olivia Wilde looks like she has just freshened up in every frame while her character is in the harshest of conditions. With its bloated runtime, it can work up your patience as everything looks all too familiar even with a fresh mash-up of genres.Cast, premise and technology could not save the insensitivity of its handling",Cowboys & Aliens
130,Ryan_MYeah,"Very fun, well acted, the tonal shifts just drag it down a bit.",6,6 August 2011,"What do you get when you mash up the genres of old Hollywood westerns and sci-fi action films? You get an ambitious, slight misfire called Cowboys & Aliens, the newest film from Iron Man director, Jon Favreau.In the film, a man (Played by Daniel Craig) wakes up in the desert, with no memory of who he is. When he wanders into a busted up town, he's recognized as western outlaw Jake Lonergan. But once Lonergan is captured, a swarm of alien scout ships take people from the town hostage, for use in their mysterious intentions. To rescue the town's people, as well as piece together his lost memory, he joins a posse led by crime boss Woodrow Dollarhyde (Played by Harrison Ford), and also takes interest in a mysterious traveler (Played by Olivia Wilde).Just gonna get this out of the way. The first 30 minutes are fantastic. It plays out like a straight western, it raises intrigue, it secures tension, Craig and Ford are great, Olivia Wilde, Sam Rockwell, and Paul Dano turn in solid characters, it establishes a tone, and it's beautifully designed. The first act is TERRIFIC! ...And then that's where the movie went downhill.It's not a bad movie, but it isn't a good movie either. The screenplay, written by a total of six different people, just doesn't always give proper answers, and arcs in story feel unsatisfying, but the solid performances of the cast do help that out some. The biggest problem with the film is that the distinctive Hollywood western and sci-fi action tones tend to clash with one another. It is difficult for them to find even ground, and they don't always mesh together.Still, the action scenes are quite good, the movie moves quickly, and is exceptionally designed. It's shot grandly by Matthew Libatique, tailored fittingly by Mary Zophres, and dazzling rendered by Industrial Light & Magic. The standout aspect, however, is the sound. The mix is neatly and coherently handled, and the sound design by David Farmer and Frank Eulner is outstanding.Cowboys & Aliens has problems, but the good definitely outweighs the bad... and the ugly, if we wanna go THAT far. :D**1/2 out of ****",Cowboys & Aliens
131,aramis-112-804880,Top Niotch Western,7,26 October 2015,"If you thought Hollywood didn't know how to make a decent western anymore, check out ""Cowboys and Aliens."" Drawbacks: Daniel Craig is unemotive almost to the point of being an automaton; he might be in a zombie movie. The film is so purposely deadpan it never gives the audience a wink (filmmakers don't give their audiences credit for enough imagination). And while heroine Olivia Wilde is lovely, her looks are so very strange they're unnerving (there is a purpose for that I won't reveal).On the other side, the film is full of colorful characters, like the polite outlaw holding up a posse. Another excellent performance is turned is turned in by Sam Rockwell, in a small part. And though it's not mentioned much the movie treats the characters' spirituality with respect and even has a likable, sensible preacher (an extreme rarity in Christian-hating Hollywood).Harrison Ford, as expected, is excellent, though his gruff voice is a bit grating at times.Overall, a solid western with an interesting twist: what would happen if a typical western town was invaded with body-snatching aliens? Can cowboys and Indians with conventional weapons of the period hope to compete with futuristic invaders? Well, I won't reveal that part. But the movie is almost unrelievedly grim, with only Rockwell and the preacher being given lines of any wit.",Cowboys & Aliens
132,martinrobertson300482,Two average movies mixed together = One bigger average movie!,6,1 September 2011,"""Cowboys and aliens"" is a great idea in theory. I don't think I've ever seen any other movie set in the old west where aliens turn up (Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong) and it stars James Bond and Indiana Jones, as well as having a dream cast off character actors in there too. It should really be an ace movie. So why am I struggling too think off a reason why it isn't? Maybe its because the title pretty much tells you the whole story, leaving no room for surprises. A stranger walks into town (never mind being the man with no name, this one can't even remember his own name) and proves how tough he is, only for UFOs too come along and steal some off the town folk, leaving them looking for someone too lead the way into saving them.Daniel Craig is basically James Bond with an American accent, while Harrison Ford is a bit meaner than he is as Indiana Jones but is still wearing a hat. Everyone else is in the parts you usually see them in too, with Sam Rockwell leading the way as the funny one (Though not too funny eh?). Even the aliens are forgettable in what is a good movie in that it's a combination off things we've never seen together before I guess. Problem is its still lacking a memorable story, the action you'd expect from a western, or the horror you'd expect from an alien movie.""Cowboys and aliens"" is balancing just above average for at least trying too be something new, but would off probably been better sticking with one thing or the other.

134,rparham,Entertaining combination of genres,7,4 August 2011,"With a title like Cowboys & Aliens, you might assume no basic plot summary is needed. And to a point you are correct. The recent release from director Jon Favreau and producers Steven Spielberg and Ron Howard is indeed about cowboys and aliens. Some have compared the title to the overly simplistic, matter of fact title of Snakes on a Plane, but in that case it was announcing itself as a farce, here I don't quite get that same vibe. Nonetheless, Cowboys & Aliens does deliver on its title, but along the way provides a decent merging of the two disparate subjects, albeit the film feels a little more cowboys than aliens most of the time.Opening in the old west, we are treated to a lone man awakening in the desert (Daniel Craig), who, after putting down some individuals who stumble upon him with less than noble intentions for the stranger, he confiscates a horse and makes his way to Absolution, a desert mining town that doesn't appear to have produced much gold. The stranger lacks memory and an understanding of why he has a strange metal bracelet on his wrist. After an altercation with Percy Dolarhyde(Paul Dano), the son of a powerful local cattle rancher, the local sheriff (Keith Carridine) intercedes, and he recognizes the stranger as the wanted stagecoach robber Jake Lonergan. As Longergan and the son are about to be shuffled off by stagecoach, the father, Colonel Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford) arrives demanding the release of his son and wants Lonergan also for personal reasons. However, at that moment, the aliens of the title make an appearance, and capture a number of the townsfolk, after which Longergan, Dolarhyde and others decide to follow to get their loved ones back, and Lonergan hopes to find his memories. They are accompanied on their trip by a loner named Ella (Olivia Wilde) who shows a great deal of interest in Lonergan's missing past.For a great deal of its early running time, Cowboys & Aliens has the appearance of a fairly standard, full bore western. We are introduced to a strong, silent loner in the visage of Craig, there is a brawl at the saloon, and it is discovered that the local town cow-tows to Dolarhyde, a man who isn't the nicest of people and wields his influence to get things to go his way. And, actually, once the aliens first appear in the picture in the guise of spaceships swooping out of the sky and capturing various individuals, it still isn't too different from a scene from most any other western, just replacing Indians or bandits with extraterrestrials. It isn't until later that the path from a typical western deviates a bit more, but with generally entertaining results.Despite the fact that the film is working within the confines of its standard genres, albeit a bit mashed up, Cowboys & Aliens proves a fairly effective combination. There is a sense of mystery to the proceedings, and when the action scenes kick in, they are engaging, and the film doesn't completely skimp on fleshing out its characters. It is somewhat notable that both of the leads are not the nicest of people: Lonergan is robber and Dolarhyde is mean and off-putting at first. Still, both characters are allowed some room to grown and thanks to the actors inhabiting the parts, we begin to feel for them towards the end. Craig fills out the Clint Eastwood-esque role appropriately, making Lonergan stoic, but with a bit more humanity showing through than in other roles of this type. Ford makes Dolarhyde a hard case and isn't afraid to turn off the charm that made him a movie star with this part. Olivia Wilde, with her gorgeous angular face, provides just the right degree of unusual to Ella, which serves the character well.Favreau, and especially his cinematographer, Matthew Libatique, have certainly made a film that looks good, shot largely in windswept exteriors for much of its running time that actually manages to not get caught up in the grimy, downbeat appearance of the modern western. And when the titular aliens do make an appearance, while they are not revolutionary, there is a degree of menace to them.Cowboys & Aliens is certainly not pushing any boundaries of creativity here. The film sticks to the traditions of its inherited genres but that doesn't mean familiar can't also equal entertaining. For the most part, Cowboys and Aliens delivers a decent action film that proves more than diverting. Saddle up the horses and ride on down to the multiplex for good time at the movies.",Cowboys & Aliens
135,FairlyAnonymous,"The beginning of the movie is good, but the second part drags",6,5 August 2011,"This is one of those movies that I hadn't really been expecting to be ingenious or anything, but I didn't give it low expectations. I was curious how the movie would turn out and how well it would follow the premise (comic). Well it was a bit of a disappointment.The first half of the movie is great, and really is enjoyable. The movie at first introduces the aliens fairly quickly, but you don't see too much of them at first. This is what made it fun, was because they encounter the aliens every once in awhile. I think the movie did kind of show the true form of the aliens a little too quickly, but besides that it was good.The second half however was not quite as good. The first half of the movie was enjoyable because it felt very much like a western, but just with some mysterious aliens that are seen every once in awhile. The second half however entirely drops the western theme, and goes more into a gigantic battle that lasts a little too long. There are some gruesome deaths in this movie, and the aliens seem to attack everyone in the same way, by leaping onto the helpless victim and biting.The acting in the movie was quite good, and there is some enjoyable action sequences, some mild mystery, and some nice set designs. I guess the biggest problem is that the movie doesn't seem to have a sense of accomplishment at the end, because in the movie it says this was only a scout ship... doesn't that mean that the aliens are still around?

136,kevinxirau,"First dinosaurs, now aliens. What will they come up next?",6,20 December 2011,"This is a match-up that's just totally unexpected. Sure, cowboys fighting dinosaurs in ""The Valley of Gwangi"" was crazy enough, but now we have Westerns taking on extraterrestrials that came to Earth with a realistic but odd motivation: gold! Throw in a big cast and you got yourself one heck of a hoedown. This is Cowboys and Aliens.Like so many movies nowadays, this one is based on the comic (which I never read). You have this stranger (Daniel Craig) who wakes up with little memory of who he was with a strange device on his wrist. He gets into a town inhabited by misfits (Harrison Ford, Clancy Brown, Olivia Wilde, etc.) and suddenly war-like aliens come down and terrorize them. Everyone's gotta team up despite their differences against these creatures.Emotions are conveyed well enough and the themes are quite substantial. There's good comedy here and there as well throughout the film to keep a smile on your face. The aliens are pretty creative, almost like a cross between a frog and a crab. They're powerful as well as really menacing. The action scenes are pretty impressive; they keep you guessing on what's gonna happen next.I do have some problems though. I think that aliens coming for gold, while interesting and realistic, felt like something's missing. They could have gone after other precious metals like silver and it seems slaughtering the local population is unnecessary. Also, the movie came out at the same time as so many other alien movies, which makes this one seem to bend in with the crowd. It's a bit of a buzz kill and it takes away a point or two.Overall, decent but nothing special. I expected a little more but there's nothing I can do. It all makes me think that they should do a remake of ""The Valley of Gwangi."" Wanna see cowpokes fighting crab-frogs from space, then check it out.",Cowboys & Aliens

Outlaw Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig) wakes up with amnesia and a strange device strapped to his wrist. Eventually he makes his way to the old west town of Absolution, where he finds himself in trouble and in the middle of several unfolding story lines. This is all well and good since all are about to come together when aliens hellbent on taking over the world appear, and Jake and all the characters of the town are all that stands in their way.The Good: This is an A-list cast. Everyone in this movie could, and have pulled the weight of movies by themselves let alone in an ensemble like this. There always has to be a pretty girl and Olivia Wilde could sit still and fulfill that role ( a role that was originally tagged for Eva Green, an equally hot choice). It's got a little of it all, comedy, action, sci-fi, aliens, western, and gunslinging action. It's also a big budget blockbuster so the filming aspects, camera work editing and special effects are topnotch so it has no need to try and be some sort of artsy film, just a decadently fun one.The Bad: The A-list cast which is also a good thing, sometimes just drowns out each other. Daniel Craig has the main role but as the movie goes on, all the others have visible roles as well and that kind of muddies it a bit. I don't really think this film has a real identity, it at times tries to be, and fit into many different styles. At times it goes sci-fi thriller, at others a spaghetti western, a more modern gunslinger western, and a romance story, all with a little comic book type feel mixed in (It is a comic book based movie). It can become a little too much at times, and sometimes a little corny. There were other times that I started to feel it was running a little long and drawn out as well. Fortunately, it is a pretty fun, and entertaining movie so I can forgive some of that. I am actually pretty surprised at how much I liked it.All in all, I give it a 7 out of 10. It was a fun and entertaining movie to watch. It's got a bit of a dark edge here and there that doesn't make it a total cheese-fest, the A-list cast both helps and hurts, and it is somewhat original. Jon Favreau didn't do as great of a job as he did with Ironman, but it fits the mold of a big action blockbuster, albeit not one I will be hoping he makes a sequel to.Like my review? Hate em?

141,Ric-7,Call it my guilty pleasure,8,4 August 2011,"I read no reviews by anyone until after I saw the film, which I rather enjoyed. I now see that I should not have enjoyed myself. Oh, gosh, I am so ashamed. Let me retroactively have a bad time. Oh, well; oh, WTF.If we are going to willingly pay to see alien-invasion films, might not that have occurred two centuries ago? So I don't know of any problem with cowboys dealing with aliens, any more than Sigourney Weaver dealing with them. Or Arnold dealing with them.What I saw was an alien invasion with most if not all of the cinematic western clichés thrown in. Starting with the loyal dog who easily switches loyalties depending on who survives a particular fight. And the hero being an enigmatic Man With No Name--so enigmatic he can't even remember his name. A man of few words, but with superhuman abilities in combat. Did he have those abilities before he got that strange bracelet? Well, of course. And the little kid fixing on a hero who is not a family member.Even the very touching scene of a reconciliation of bigoted Anglo cowboy and non-white ""son"" is traceable to the interaction between the John Wayne and Jeffrey Hunter characters in ""The Searchers."" There are probably many more parallels, and I've not taken the time to think over and list them all. If you can think of a western cliché, it is probably in this film. And carefully mixed with Invaders From Mars clichés. Such as the riverboat (compare ""Close Encounters""). Such as the alien opening its body (compare ""Aliens""), and a suitably pre-Mechanical Revolution thing emerges--manual rather than mechanical.The addition of the ""Indians"" was also very interesting. The Native Americans were the traditional movie opponents of the cowboys. Here, they have common cause to oppose the aliens.On a scale of believability, could the Cowboys ever have defeated the Aliens? Even with the ""Indians"" helping out? Not really. Not even with the assistance of a Sister From Another Planet.But in Movie World (kind of like Bizarro World, where everything is backwards), here we have James Bond and Han Solo plus Tonto and Lassie and maybe Princess Leia, versus the other guys. And could anyone be surprised at who would prevail in that contest? This film will not live forever in history as a classic. But I thoroughly enjoyed it.",Cowboys & Aliens

But that's not enough to be a good movie, the story is quite simplistic and uninteresting, and the worst was how the action sequences are ridiculously lack of continuity and completely inconsistent, I never knew how from being completely overwhelmed next second it's all the opposite with no reason, and the aliens seem to be easily hurt some times and unstoppable the next scene. Or one moment they're looking at the enemy from the hill next to their base and next scene they have to ride their horses a long way to get there (weren't they there already? Oh yeah, we need a riding scene, they look cool, let's just tuck one there no one will notice). Just way too many of these things.I wasn't expecting a masterpiece in storytelling, but I honestly couldn't overlook all this, even though the setting can sound ridiculous and be unrealistic, the action and events can be written with intelligence and coherence, but no one here does anything clever, nothing makes sense.There are a lot of clichés, shallow characters and a way too long running time, which really dragged its pace and bored me.Absolute fail on the writing aspect, all the rest is somehow what you'd expect from this particular director and theme.",Cowboys & Aliens

This movie is so ridiculous you would want to ho after the producers and shoot them yourself.Cowboys fighting Aliens with pistols and horses???!!! Really?? Not even Harrison Ford or the lovely Olivia Wilde make it appeal in any way. The concept of this movie is so stupid I can't even go on reviewing this title. Anyway, DON'T WATCH IT!",Cowboys & Aliens
145,Gideon24,Riveting despite the fact it makes no sense,6,9 December 2015,"Cowboys & Aliens is an outrageous and unprecedented melding of the western and science fiction genres that has all the ingredients for a first rate popcorn movie except for one thing...a story that makes sense.The 2011 film opens with us encountering Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig), a cowboy who wakes up in an 1873 Arizona desert with no memory of who he is, a serious wound on his side, and a futuristic looking weapon attached to one of his wrists. Jake travels to a nearby western hamlet called Absolution where it is revealed he is a wanted man on multiple charges. En route to facing a federal Marshall, the town is attacked by a group of alien space ships that snatch up several citizens in the town, but Jake is somehow able to fend them off with his wrist weapon. Jake then teams up with a group of Absolution citizens, led by a military colonel/cattle baron (Harrison Ford), whose son (Paul Dano) was abducted by the aliens. Throw into the mix a mysterious prostitute (Olivia Wilde) who claims a vague connection to Jake and her own agenda regarding these bizarre events.The story also involves a woman from Jake's past whose death he feels responsible for and a large cache of gold and a large gang of criminal cowboys who apparently were led by Jake who are torn by Jake's alleged reappearance in their gang, though Jake seems to have no recall of his association with them.If this sounds confusing, it's because it is...this story is a valiant attempt at trying something off the cinematic beaten path, but there is WAY too much left unexplained. We're never sure if Jake is really from the 1870's west or from the future, where the gold came from and if it is real gold as we see it morph into an explosive device that blows a roof off a building or why a group of futuristic space aliens want control of an 1870's western town. I kept watching and waiting for that one scene or moment in the film that would pull everything together for me, but that moment never came, not even after the bloody and terrifying final act where the wild west and outer space have their final showdown.As confusing as I found the story to be, I kept watching. I found this film absolutely riveting and could not take my eyes off the screen. Steven Spielberg and Jon Favreau served as executive producers of this film and Favreau also took on the mammoth directorial responsibility involved in the mounting of such an elaborate story, though Spielberg's touch is all over this...this is the kind of fantasy/adventure that Spielberg likes to produce and I'm sure he had Favreau's ear throughout production.This film is expensively mounted with a great deal of care and detail and the casting works for the most part. Daniel Craig is the most durable action hero since John McClane and Harrison Ford shows he still has the chops to command the screen. Olivia Wilde makes the most of her most substantial screen role and there is also a solid supporting turn from Sam Rockwell as a saloon owner whose wife was also abducted by the aliens. There is some entertainment value to be gleaned from this film, as long as you don't think about it or try to figure it out.",Cowboys & Aliens
146,blacklist-1,"A sci-fi western with great potential, which was never fulfilled and that took itself far too seriously.",5,28 August 2011,"With a title like Cowboys and Aliens, mixing the genre of sci-fi and western (obviously done before with Will Smith in Wild, Wild West and I'm sure other films too) and with a star studded cast of Harrison Ford, Daniel Craig and Olivia Wilde, it promises the idea of a wacky and wild fun ride with the air of a good old fashioned adventure with great action and funny comedy. Unfortunately the end result though not a complete disaster is a rather bland and incomplete affair with too many problems with it to ignore. Obviously there are those that have said that a film with the title Cowboys and Aliens shouldn't be taken seriously and that it's just harmless entertainment and it shouldn't be nitpicked. However the tone of this film, which compliments Jon Favreau's intentions is to be serious and for us to approach it in the same manner, which is just ludicrous for a B-Movie such as this. So if we are going to take it seriously as Favreau wants us to then it has to be critiqued, both positive and negative aspects.What adds to this seriousness is the element of mystery that Favreau presents particularly surrounding the character of Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig) like who is he? What happened to him? And what is that metal bracelet on his arm? There are also more questions as well that fit together like a puzzle as reviewer Terry Roehrig II rightly points out and again when all revealed it's very simplistic, which is a bit of let down as it just has that air of mysteriousness, which makes you feel as though when all is revealed it will be something exciting, but no. The film seriously needed to have more of a sense of humour, though there a few chuckling moments I did enjoy and Daniel Craig gives a great performance, it needed an actor with a sharper and wittier sense of humour. It has already been suggested Robert Downey Jr would have been perfect for this role who would have injected some much needed life into this soulless film. Of course an actor can only do so much with an awful script which felt poorly written and lazy. It was truly dreadful, particularly when it came to the schmaltz moments of Jake having memories of his wife and him and Ella (Wilde) sharing an intimate moment or two (They lacked any romantic chemistry) or various members of the clan trying to bond when they go off in search of the aliens that took their loved ones etc. I wouldn't have minded these moments but it was just boring and uninvolving and we don't come to care about any of these characters or what happens to them, though it tries to be touching. All I wanted was for it to get to the next action sequence.There are also large plot holes in this movie, which others have already pointed out and it just becomes too long. The last forty minutes in particular being the worst and when the film hit the eighty five-ninety minute mark I just wanted the film to end instead I had to put up with another tedious twenty five minutes. Faverau had this problem before of an overlong film (Iron Man 2) trying to go for character development and substance in which he just fails. The thing is there is a wasted opportunity for this as Woodrow (Harrison Ford) and Jake have a disliking to each other. Their relationship is never explored, though their in the same film together for most of it, they spend it apart with little interaction and dialogue. This makes it seem as Terry Roehrig II again rightly says it's as though Ford and Craig are starring in two different films at the same time. It instead ends up with Jake mainly interacting with Wilde's character Ella and Woodrow with some native Indian chief of a tribe. If Speilburg executive producer of this film had been in the driving seat, this would have turned out differently. However where Faverau cannot be faulted is the action sequences (though the last one was overlong), they were choreographed superbly with plenty of suspense and tension. These were the moments I most enjoyed. The special effects too were impressive with good leading performances from the three main stars, particularly Ford being a villain for once. The scenery itself was lovely to look at and there was some great soundtrack music. I did actually really enjoy the first seventy minutes being a few minutes here and there that were boring. I was at a point where I was thinking of giving the film a seven out of ten but by the end I was sorely tempted to whittle it to four, but I thought that would be unfair as it does have some saving graces, but really it's too rusty around the edge with a slow pace. With a better suited leading actor for the role (no offense to Craig), Speilburg being at the helm and the tone taking itself less seriously this film could have really been something of the highest entertainment. But it falls well short and the finishing product is a film that is messy and largely bland. The stars Craig, Ford and Wilde deserved better material than this and so did the audience. It's just a pity that the potential the film had was never reached or realised by those making it.",Cowboys & Aliens
147,axlrhodes,Yee-snore.,5,17 August 2012,"What promises to be a mega budget all star slice of B-movie fun is instead yet another session of Hollywood hoop jumping with a predictable plot, clichéd characters and a lifeless script. Taking the reigns is Iron Man director Jon Favreau and while his film is a handsome looking spectacle, it's also a saggy one that plods along in a seemingly aimless way. The coming together of the energy and fun of the alien invasion movie versus the true grit, slow burn of the western genre never really pays dividends. For starters, the aliens themselves are a crude collection of computer generated nondescripts that serve only to jump and leap around in the most underwhelming way while at the same time picking off the disposable cast members. What's more, they are given no real introduction or mysticism which reduces their threat to that of your average video game gribbly. What should be the dream screen pairing of Indiana Jones and James Bond results in a chemistry vacuum in which both actor does his own thing in a reasonably solid but forgettable way. Olivia Wilde and Sam Rockwell tag along for eye candy and comic relief respectively, but neither gets much chance to shine due to a criminally witless script. It might look the part, but Cowboys & Aliens is a mostly unrewarding experience that begins promisingly but gets lost and chokes in it's own dust. Yee-snore.",Cowboys & Aliens

149,tapio_hietamaki,Cliché and unimaginative,2,3 October 2013,"Over-hyped sums this film up pretty well.Sure it's got a fun premise and some great actors, but the story fails on several levels. First up: we wanted to see cowboys vs. aliens, not cowboys abusing alien technology and alien cowgirls.There wasn't subtlety - the whole abduction thing isn't surrounded by mystery, everything is plain as day. There wasn't discussion of the topic - who are these demons exactly and where are they coming from? The aliens themselves looked bad. Classic western character types weren't utilized... well, they were utilized a _little_. It wasn't all bad. Harrison Ford takes on the ""tough rich guy""-trope with great results. Daniel Craig is badass as ever. Olivia Wilde is beautiful, but her character suffers from really bad lines, stuff that is supposed to be cryptic but is really just obvious.",Cowboys & Aliens
150,bob_bear,Humdrum & Humorless,4,9 June 2012,"You'd think that with a title like Cowboys & Aliens that this film would have a sense of humor, if not its tongue placed firmly in its cheek? Think again. It takes itself far too seriously and with no good reason as it's just another case of a mega budget being thrown at a p*ss-poor script.A case of too many whys and not enough wherefores: 1. Why did the alien ship attack the cattle herd? Did they have gold-plated udders? 2. Why did it take hours to reach Dollarhyde to inform him of his son's incarceration yet minutes to get back to town? 3. Why did nobody visibly grieve when their loved ones were abducted? 4. Why was no one in shock and awe re. the aliens and their spaceships? I could go on...and on...and on...It is well made, the cast is great, the budget is impressive but the film is as dull as dishwater. My advice: Give it a miss.",Cowboys & Aliens

Bravo for making such a cockamamy premise work; credit to the character development. Top shelf action and special effects. Captures the western flavor very well, and maintains it while weaving in the sci-fi. A little too gradual on the reveal but manages to incorporate humor that's not too silly, and even to be dramatically touching on top of everything else. A fun flick for the favorites collection.",Cowboys & Aliens
152,ThreeGuysOneMovie,a convoluted mess of a picture,5,26 May 2012,"the film was a convoluted mess of a picture. I am a big Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford fan so I had big expectations. This coupled with the fact that it was supposedly based on a graphic novel of some renown and was being directed by Jon Favreau led me to believe it was going to be something worth watching. I mean who doesn't like cowboys and who doesn't like aliens, they should go together like chocolate and peanut butter. However, they ended up going together as well as pop rocks and coca cola. Also they had a lot of Indians in this film and that wasn't mentioned in the title or the previews.

153,skymovies,Yeehaw-some,7,29 July 2011,"Somewhere out West. Man (Craig) wakes up in the desert, bleeding. Weird metal manacle on his wrist. Doesn't know who he is. Doesn't know how he got there. Kills some passing lowlifes. Rides to the nearest town: Absolution.Ordinary kinda place. Usual kinda folks: kindly preacher (Clancy Brown), fretful barkeep-cum-doctor (Sam Rockwell), dog-tired sheriff (Keith Carradine), purty mystery lady Ella (Olivia Wilde), young troublemaker (Paul Dano).Turns out the latter boy's untouchable, bein' son of local bigwig Dolarhyde (Ford) an' all. Figures he can push the stranger around. Figures wrong. Turns out it's Jake Lonergan - a bigger villain than old man Dolarhyde.So just another day in Absolution. Til nightfall that is, when a bunch of machines swoop down from the sky, blow the town to smithereens and make off with half the people usin' some kinda fancy lassoes.Aliens. Doggone.Only thing that'll stop 'em is Jake's fancy wrist cannon. So if they want their folks back, everybody's gonna have to put their differences aside and posse up to track them unidentified flying varmints down.Along the way, Jake gradually gets his memory back. Runs into his old gang too. And some Apaches.Also finds out what mysterious Ella's all about and what the ETs want (same thing as everyone else, truth be told).It's all based on one o' them graphic novels. But with a tale as outlandish as this, it proves a wise move to play it straight. Mostly.Course, there's a gutful of guffaws to be had, but it all pans out like 3:10 to The Alamo. With more alien splatting.Director Favreau has great fun with his flashbacks and dandy effects and such. Even throws in a few sly nods to the genre, yessiree.But what he needs is a manly, clenched jaw or two to carry it off. And what he gets in Craig and Ford. That's what they do.The set-up's terrific. Pacing's a mite skew-whiff though. The search and rescue bit kinda drags. Favreau needs to put his spurs in more often. Bringing the sheriff's grandkid along don't speed things along none either. Coulda made more use of the dog too.It ain't free o' clichés. But then what western is? Want a mash-up that does what it says it's gonna do? Saddle up.",Cowboys & Aliens
154,skoyles,Wow!,9,6 December 2011,"What kind of a movie is this? A Western with care and attention paid to clothing (although I question a few things, one hat in particular) and firearms; a horror film with fearsome ugly monsters; a drama propelled by character development; a complex story of family relationships; a buddy cop movie; a science-fiction story; and possibly a few other things. Despite, or perhaps because, of this complexity ""Cowboys and Aliens"" is an amazingly satisfying cinema experience. Harrison Ford can do more good acting without lines than anyone in decades. He is a Westerner in a Western. Daniel Craig learned to be a Westerner; the scene when he and Ford are fleeing an explosion and Craig bends down to grab his hat on the run is not something an Easterner or a Brit would ever do. The effects are great too. I had been looking forward to seeing C&A for a long time but with low expectations. Can one really take that title seriously? What a pleasure to enjoy a big noisy motion picture more than anticipated. I loved this film! And I loved the hummingbird.",Cowboys & Aliens
155,quinnox-1,A typical summer movie that delivers what you expect,7,30 July 2011,"This was better than I thought it would be. The aliens being in the Old West cowboys era sounds really corny but its played straight and there are no lame jokes or stupid humor bits about it. The cowboys have suitable confusion and fear regarding the aliens and speculate they are evil demons of some kind which is plausible considering their historical era and what they might have thought back then confronted with this unearthly phenomenon.That said, the aliens themselves are designed badly and look cheesy and disappointing. Its too bad they look so ridiculous because it takes away the believability that the actors try so hard to present regarding the situation. Daniel Craig is decent as the lead character but I've never been a fan of his, however he is OK here as a world weary outlaw who is confronted with a bizarre and unexpected alien presence/invasion.I really liked the Indian Chief, I thought he was very good in his part and the movie became more interesting when he entered the picture. Meanwhile, Harrison Ford does a crotchety old man character who is set in his ways but may have a heart of gold and plays it pretty well.Some nice desert vistas and scenery really enhance the movie and give it an authentic Old West feel. I'm a sucker for Westerns so even with the absurd aliens in it I did enjoy this movie. It has some good action scenes in it and delivers what you might expect for a light summer entertainment outing.",Cowboys & Aliens
156,neenahhh,A movie about cowboys and aliens?! Not as bad as it sounds!,8,13 August 2011,"A movie involving cowboys and aliens? I couldn't have been more skeptical about a film! I came into the movie theater with low expectations and was very much surprised with the quality of the film! ""Cowboys & Aliens"" was intense, full of action, had a good mix of comedy and drama, and was just all around great!I was surprised at the intensity of the film. During the high powered action moments, I found that I couldn't take my eyes of the screen. What I liked the most about the film were the characters. They were never clearly defined as either good nor bad. The characters were human beings. Like us, they had both good and bad qualities. I found myself tearing up at at least two of the scenes involving the background characters. The actors were brilliant. Enough said.It's disappointing to see that it's mostly the negative reviews that are being featured on the IMDb page. I mean, really? Aside from the choppy transitions, this was great! ""Cowboys & Aliens"" really is a super intense film! I didn't even notice the time passing! Don't miss out on this one! Who knew western and sci-fi could mix really well together!",Cowboys & Aliens
157,piratecannon,James Bond and Indiana Jones vs. the Saucer Men from Mars,7,26 December 2012,"I'll admit it: I was ridiculously giddy when I first saw the teaser for Cowboys & Aliens. I mean, Harrison Ford, Daniel Craig, Sam Rockwell and an insane genre mash-up? What is there not to love? Seriously?Then the reviews began trickling in after the film's recent Comic Con premier. Most critics have lambasted the picture as being much too predictable, dull, or some synonym thereof. While I don't disagree that it pulls any unforeseeable punches, I do think the movie is a fun experiment that could have been much, much worse.Is it a western? Is it a piece of science fiction? The answer, of course, is that it's both. Cowboys & Aliens straddles an extraordinarily fine line that sees it succeed on many levels, but there are certainly times where the logic of the whole thing is a little headache-inducing. It's surprisingly preachy from time to time, too. I mean, when you have a finale that sees Native Americans, cowboys, stage- coach mercenaries and the like joining forces it looks an awful lot like Independence Day (or any other ""we've got bigger fish to fry"" extra- terrestrial invasion flicks).For my money, the film is perfectly cast. Ford is great as the grizzled Civil War vet who's hanging on to just a sliver of humanity, and Craig iswell his usual James-Bondish self (okay, so maybe he's not quite so debonair here, but you get the point). The ladies like him, he's an efficient killing machine, so on and so forth.The aliens themselves are slickly designed too, and they possess a noticeably menacing presence when they're tackling outlaws on horseback and using goo-covered mandibles to toy with their prey.Again, Cowboys & Aliens is a lot of fun, but it's not going to set the world on fire. On the most basic level, it exists purely as a love letter to sci-fi fans who love ridiculously outrageous genre benders.",Cowboys & Aliens

159,ksj870,Entertaining Sci-fi Western,7,28 June 2012,"Despite a title that suggests a very bad comedy, Cowboys and Aliens is actually a very entertaining action film that stays surprisingly true to the classic Western genre. Yes, the plot does require a pretty generous leap of faith to accept, even in terms of movies, but think about itis the basic concept really any more far-fetched than Independence Day or War of the Worlds? But still, the story does sound a bit bizarre at first blush. Daniel Craig plays a man who wakes up in the Arizona desert with no memory of who he is or how he got there. A strange metal bracelet is fastened on his wrist, one that doesn't look like anything fashioned by mortal man and won't come off. Looking for answers, Craig's character rides into the nearest town, one where Woodrow Dollarhyde (Harrison Ford) lords it over the townsfolk with his money and fearsome reputation. But there's also a strange, alluring woman named Ella, a woman who knows something bad is coming, and who may hold the key to the benighted cowboy's past.And something bad is comingstrange flying things from the sky, things that have weapons no Earthman has ever seen before, things that grab people from the town's streets and take them up into their depths. What are these strange invaders? Are they demons? Beings from another world? And how can they be defeated? Somehow, Craig's mysterious cowboy holds the key.It's an original take on a couple of old Hollywood standby's—the Alien Invasion flick and the classic Western. Amazingly, the two polar opposites come together quite well. The Western setting is gritty and unforgiving, while Craig and Ford play their characters with a sincerity that makes suspension of disbelief a little easier. Olivia Wilde is her usual gorgeous self, and her character remains full of surprises all movie long. The alien invaders themselves are extremely vicious and rather imposing creatures, the perfect movie villains. Special effects are outstanding, and the action nearly nonstop.Director Jon Favreau fashions a fantastic but not altogether unbelievable tale out of it all, and even if the combo of sci-fi and gunslinger shouldn't work, it does. Don't let the concept scare you off—unlikely as it seems, Cowboys and Aliens is a marvelously entertaining flick that's guaranteed to be unlike anything else you've ever seen.",Cowboys & Aliens
160,ciscokid1970,Great fun and awesome blend of sci fi and western,9,5 August 2011,"This was a fantastic adaptation of Scott Mitchell Rosenberg's comic book. This movie used a perfect combination of old west cowboy setting and aliens shock factor. The western theme of the story is so good it could stand on its own. The sci-fi addition of the aliens was not overdone yet they spared no expense making the aliens. (This is NOT some cheap low budget low light syfy TV movie) All the actors involved were great. Story was solid. Action is continuous and special effects are brilliant. This movie is safe to take younger kids if they are not afraid of monsters or too much violence. I like the twist of Aliens visiting 1800s USA, kind of reminds me of Predator and FireFly. The actors all did a great job Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Sam Rockwell, Keith Carradine, Adam Beach, Paul Dano and Olivia Wilde. Each brought their A game. Cinematography and set design was outstanding; like I said even the little details sold me on the western. This movie deserves to be seen on the big screen due to the great action scenes and special effects. Not worth IMAX or 3D, so you can save a few bucks there.All in all Great movie worth watching in the theater and buying on Blue Ray.",Cowboys & Aliens

Sure, there is a somewhat tragic story as well, but who cares. That is the formula they made it on, anyway. Unfortunately, but...There is one thing i never got about alien movies that are meant to be like big spectacles. How is it possible for a super intelligent alien species to be that stupid? I mean, supposedly they have this super advanced technology, but without surveillance cameras or anything of any kind that could warn them of danger approaching or help them spot the enemy. They don't even have any cloths. Not to mention that they act like dogs in battle. And that's an insult for the dogs. I mean, no strategy, no nothing. I'd expect something a bit more intelligent from someone who's supposed to be super intelligent. Dogs can at least sneak on you. I highly doubt it that anyone capable of thinking would just run out in the rain of bullets for some cowboys and Indians with no technology what-so-ever to shoot them. It's just stupid. Also, one would think that their ship will be highly equipped with all sorts of weapons and devices unknown to the man, but no. Instead, their ship looks like a cave or something. And i just can't buy it that they look like these giant monsters covered in saliva with no cloths of any kind and so on... And that's supposed to be the race that conquered a couple of planets on their way to earth. ... But that can't conquer a bunch of stupid cowboys and Indians even though they can take like ten bullets before they're killed. Yeah, right. I'm buying it.There is a whole lot of things about this movie that make no sense and that are just irritating and stupid, but where it does work, and works best, is entertainment. It's never boring or heavy to watch and the characters, even though seen a thousand times before, are more than bearable. I only wish they were funnier occasionally. And the acting is fine, too. Harrison Ford would be the star of the crew, but as far as acting alone goes, no one was above average.The one thing that is a bit disappointing and that shouldn't be are visuals. I just expected them to be better. Perhaps it's because of the terrible alien design, they look a lot more like demons than aliens, but they should've been better.The movie works well on purely entertaining level, but if you're looking for anything more, and i mean anything, don't expect to get it from this film.",Cowboys & Aliens

The famous names don't bring anything to the film, especially Harrison Ford. We should get paid to watch him, he's so bad.The plot is paper thin and we get teased with all sorts of fantastical and amazing possibilities. But nothing ever comes of any of it. At the end I was actually angry. Nothing was explained at all other than perhaps where Daniel Craig's character came from, but even that is nothing. So what is the point of the film?? Just sit there for hours and try to admire the scenery??$100,000 thrown towards a few good writers and this could have been 10 times better. The science fiction in this film is basically a MacGuffin, so don't waste your time if sci-fi is what interests you.This film actually reminded me a bit of Outlander (2008), a mashup of new technology and old. But Outlander was so much more satisfying and at one third the budget.",Cowboys & Aliens
163,chaz-28,Too many screenwriters produce a muddled script which help neither cowboys nor aliens,4,15 August 2011,"A man with no name and no memory wakes up in the middle of the desert. He has no idea how he got there but it appears he has been in some sort of violent situation and there is a metal bracelet attached to his wrist. The stranger (Daniel Craig) unluckily attracts frequent attacks including bounty hunters, local thugs, and then aliens. He may not remember his past, but he certainly remembers how to fight and shoot. This comes in handy since the film's title is Cowboys & Aliens.Craig moseys into town trying to find answers but all he finds are the sheriff (Keith Carradine) who has a warrant out for him, the town strongman, Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford), Dolarhyde's pathetic son (Paul Dano), a mysterious woman (Olivia Wilde), and a nest of marauding aliens who attack from shoddy, metal flying contraptions.The aliens show no motive for their chaotic attacks on the town but they do kidnap some of the town folk with metal lassos. The survivors put together an ad hoc posse to go and rescue them lumping together most of the named actors who are now on the same side even though they were enemies just before the attack.The veteran actors take the material seriously and provide their respective enjoyable performances. Both Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford play grizzled and world weary men who do not seem all that shocked by aliens. They might as well be Indians or the other side in the Civil War. The supporting cast is less convincing and looks like they are just giddy to be in a film with Harrison Ford and Executive Producer Steven Spielberg.Paul Dano engages in a bit of farcical slapstick acting during his few scenes and his protector and team tracker (Adam Beach) is downright atrocious. He was quite good in Clint Eastwood's 2006 Flags of Our Fathers but seems to have lost his way here. Olivia Wilde joins the crew as an attractive woman who just happens to be in town and may not be all that she appears to be. Sam Rockwell doubles as the town doctor and bartender but is underserved with his small role and Keith Carradine who is always a pleasure to watch has barely any role at all. I have a feeling much of this cast signed on to be able to share credits with Spielberg and Ford.There are nine credited writers on this film which may be a clue as to why the script is not very good (too many cooks in the kitchen). The lead two screenwriters are Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman who appear to have worked together on all of their projects. They have produced winners with the Star Trek remake, Mission: Impossible III, and work on the Alias series but have also disappointed with the first two entries in Michael Bay's Transformers trilogy.The weight of the film feels light. There is no overriding mystery or any particular southwestern atmosphere. An Indiana Jones type mystique is absent. The script has the characters just bounce around between action sequences and lacks a positive narrative flow. Some members die, some members join, and then another battle scene will start. If there is only one alien film you get to see this year, make it Super 8 and not Cowboys & Aliens.",Cowboys & Aliens
164,gpeltz,Needs a better name,8,22 May 2018,"Spoiler Alert, Plot details discussed. 
 OK Coboys and Alines, very funny. like in Cowboys and Indians. I was not exactly blown away by the title. What blew me away was the first glorious shot. The cinamatography was just excellent; Wide screen and glorious, yet capturing the drama of the graphic novel visual power, ,Matthew Libatique captured the sweep and glory of New Mexicos grandest landscapes. Likewise appropriate was the fine score, reminiscent of Elmer bernstiens western sagas. Here the composer is Harry Greyson-Williams. Director Jon Favreau pulled all the elements together and created a grand but overlooked gem. As strange as the premise is, it is remarkably successful in blending the genera''s of Westerns and Science Fiction.
 The narrative is strange, but the star power is stellar, We watch two pros at the top of their game. Daniel Craig is the lead, a gunslinger named Jake Lonergan, awakening in the deep desert, with an iron wrist cuff. He also has amnesia and no recollection of who he is. To make matters worse, he is about to be robbed and killed by three armed bandits. The movie quickly establishes that Craig's character is not to me messed with.
 The Town of Absolution was built out of the vast landscape, A small town with the Saloon, jailhouse and Main-street. The good Sheriff John Taggeart, played by Kieth Carradine, The doc, who runs the bar with his hot blooded wife,is played by Sam Rockwell. Abagail Spencer and Olivia Wilde fill the female leads. The Villan here is the wealthy land Barron, Woodrow Dolarhyde. played with rugged vigor by Harrison Ford. Throw in about forty outlaw armies and the Apache nation and you have a whole solid fighting force to defeat ? what ? The western setting and mind set finds the flying machines that resemble robot dragonfles, as well as the malevolent creatures as demons. they have no other context to comprehend the invaders, who are here, looking for gold and plunder. 
 The creatures are convincingly portrayed as ugly things with grotesque limbs that erupt from their hideous bellys. Here I had to take issue, the creators of the technology could no way be represented by this brutish pack of hunters. Where is their science. They have advanced technology but act like barbarians. There is no way a pack of cowboys and Indians could defeat them. unless. they had an inside lead, This is where the character Ella, the mysterious, played by Olivia Wilde. She is also a stranger to our planet, and knows how to defeat the evil invaders. 
 The film builds wonderfully to the splendid climax that gives you maximum bang for your buck. thanks to the effects folks at Industrial Light and Magic. So what did I not like, Only one thing, the weak title. Hey guys, re release it but call it, ""The Sorrowful Saga of Gunslinger Jake"". or ""Gunslinger Jake and the Demons"". or ""Western Spaces"". anything but Cowboys and Aliens. This gets eight and a half ""bravo for pulling it off"" Stars out of Ten",Cowboys & Aliens
165,cattjones,Chix Chat on Film Reviews: Cowboys and Aliens,7,31 July 2011,"When I first saw the trailer for this film, I thought to myself.. oh my, what's this.. an original thought. A film that is not about a comic book, love gone wrong, love gone right or casual sex. If nothing else, this film was a break from the cookie cutter films that have been coming out lately. The title says cowboys and aliens and that is exactly what you got. There is no deep thought required. This film was just mindless fun that you can just sit back and enjoy. Will it go down in history as being a western classic? Heck No, but in several years to come you might find yourself turning to a friend or a relative saying something like, remember when they made that movie about cowboys and aliens???? I do have to admit that I was very excited about seeing James Bond and Indiana Jones in the same film. Daniel Craig (Jake Lonergan) and Harrison Ford (Colonel Dolarhyde) made a pretty good team and one was just as tough as the other. For a long time during the initial introduction of the aliens I found myself thinking that they are going to have to call on the x-men or at least Sigorney Weaver to handle this situation. There were a couple of mild surprises during the film, but for the most part it was pretty predictable. To be honest with you, I really did not care. I just wanted to see some cowboy fighting aliens. I would be remiss if I did not mention Adam Beach (Nat Colorado) and Keith Carradine (Sheriff John Taggart). I haven't seen either of them on the big screen for quite some time, so I was happy to see their reappearance. The one thing that this film did do well was that it explained all the aspects of the film. For instance, how did that bracelet get on his arm. Why are aliens here. What do they want and why did he lose his memory. I hate it when I leave a film and there are questions unanswered. Did folks get up and cheer when this film was over no. Did I think that this is a film that I might want to see again no. Did the film feel like it was two hours long no. Was it enjoyable and did it get me out of the house for a couple of hours.. yes. So, for the reasons mentioned above I am going to saddle up my horse and give this film an amber light.",Cowboys & Aliens
166,Treyroo,Western Style Sci-fi,8,24 November 2012,"We enter the story by finding a man (Daniel Craig) unconscious in the desert. He awakes with no memory and discovers a strange device on his arm that, despite numerous efforts, he can't remove. Before he's made any real assessment of his situation, he's discovered by three men who believe he'll bring them a windfall when they turn him over to the authorities. But, despite his memory loss, he makes short work of his would-be captors and moves on. Victorious but still with no memory.His wandering brings him to the nearby town of Absolution. Its inhabitants are nowhere to be seen until the local preacher (Clancy Brown) discovers him and offers to stitch the wound he (Craig) discovered when he awoke. Unfortunately, they are interrupted when Percy Dolarhyde (Paul Dano), son of the town's benefactor and all-around miscreant, causes a commotion and accidentally kills a Marshall and (Craig) subdues him. As a result, he's identified and arrested for crimes he's previously committed. Our amnesiac's name is Jake Lonergan and before being transferred, the town is attacked by mysterious creatures first referred to as demons but that are, of course, aliens. Hence the title.I was as wary as anyone when I saw the title of this film. I expected a farce with a poorly written script and star-studded cast. While the cast is chock-full of familiar faces (Olivia Wilde, Keith Carradine, Sam Rockwell and others) the film is engrossing, well-written, and easily one of the better films based on a comic book that I've seen in some time.",Cowboys & Aliens
167,StonedMagician,Above Average: 6.5,6,27 July 2019,"As many seem to be saying, most critics just don't seem to get this movie, do they? They say things like ""the genres don't mesh well enough"", and that ""this could have been better as a straight western."" Well, kinda. The sci-fi and western aspects of the movie certainly could be meshed better, and Jon Favreau could have made a good western, sure. But as it is, Cowboys and Aliens is a good, unique summer blockbuster. The cast of the film is what you would expect: a handful of big-name actors, for star appeal right off the bat. On this front, Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and Olivia Wilde certainly deliver (though Wilde could have been a bit better). Ford becomes the standard grizzled, slightly racist war veteran type. Craig plays Clint Eastwood. And Wilde is...something else (and naked). Now, in the opening credits, you will spot four (!) credited screenwriters, two of whom worked on Lost with J.J. Abrams. However, despite there being a handful of witty lines and no shortage of laugh-out-loud moments, the script could and should have been more refined, considering who would be doing that. One thing that is both very good and a bit bad is Favreau's direction. There aren't any noteworthy shots, mind you, but is is perfectly fine, and about as good as one could expect. However, I do have one tiny gripe: this film really could have been a good western. The last real one in the genre was True Grit, which was quite good, if a bit bland, and in C&A, the western parts are handles incredibly well, and hook you in far more easily than the sci-fi bits. Craig and Ford could have made quite a duo onscreen. They still do, but one can't help but think... One of the final cons of the film is the story. I know that no one was expecting anything incredible (the movie is called Cowboys and Aliens, after all), but there are far too many disparate plot elements just thrown together. You'll know what I mean when you see it. And my other small gripe is the alien design. Their ships are plenty cool, admittedly, but they themselves could use a bit more work. They look like gorillas who have served under Davy Jones from Pirates of the Caribbean. Overal, though, this is a compelling, entertaining, fun film that never takes itself too seriously, but never lets itself off the rails, either.",Cowboys & Aliens
168,austin-takahashi,Cowboys & Aliens - 2.5 Stars,5,15 January 2013,"Common sense is not welcome in a movie called ""Cowboys & Aliens"". No other non-sequel title in 2011 has given a more tempting wink to the Summer Movie Audience. It presents a preposterous yet enticing idea that feels destined to be a silly, dumb, fun action-comedy. Led by ""Ironman"" director Jon Favreau, and guided by familiar names like Ron Howard and Steven Spielberg, we feel confidence in its production.We tone our brains down in eager wait, only to be left wondering in the end why a concept ready for fun was treated with a large and unnecessary amount of seriousness. It forces upon itself a certain level of depth, which the movie has no time for. The attempts at a heavier story prolong ""Cowboys & Aliens"" to a running time of 118 minutes, where much of it is composed of overlong explanations and faulty, predictable drama. The bossy jerk learns to cooperate, the useless son learns to practice obedience, and the angry rebel learns to smile. Haven't we seen all of these before? Do they really have a place in a movie called ""Cowboys & Aliens""?The film opens with a wanted criminal, Jake Londergan, waking in the dry desert. Besides the fact that he's suffering from memory loss, Jake is battered, bleeding, and without shoes. (Jake is having a bad day.) On his left arm, is an alien bracelet precisely made to blow stuff up, like the Predator's! How did he come into possession of such an item? Did he trade his shoes for it?Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/cowboys-and-aliens-movie- review-2/",Cowboys & Aliens
169,theemuhammede,Aliens mine the West,7,3 May 2016,"This was surely a different take on a western movie and alien movie. Who would have thought two such different civilizations would exist in the same time frame. The movie was interesting, but there were some parts that could have been better.The story was weird. It was over a fight over possession of gold. Aliens after gold? Yes, it was said to be just as valuable to them as it is to humans. The aliens had a much more efficient and effective way of mining it over the humans' methods.The aliens could have been created much better though. They looked so rough and jagged. Their movement was a bit choppy as well. The ""spaceships"" they flew in were pretty sweet though. They kind of looked like a giant mechanical dragonfly.This movie is ideal for a person who enjoys both alien-related movies and cowboy set movies. But keep in mind that this one has a twist to it, and is not like all of the ordinary movies already out there.",Cowboys & Aliens
170,vandelour,Fun idea crippled by Craig and Ford,5,6 April 2019,"Not exactly a new concept for a movie but it was fun and done with style. Unfortunately somebody decided they needed some Hollywood names as the male leads and chose Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford. Craig, facially immobilized as usual, carried himself with all the style of a parking meter thru the entire movie. Ford, reaching into his bag of Acting Tricks and Tips, chose Number Two - ""Scowling Faces, Grimaces and Snarls"".Gotta have box-office stars I guess but next time when you've got a fun movie try to pick two that can act.",Cowboys & Aliens
171,tpaladino,Suspension of Disbelief,6,6 October 2012,"I didn't have high hopes for Cowboys & Aliens, as I don't think Jon Favreau is a particularly skilled or talented guy, but this film had a good cast and an interesting premise, so I gave it a shot. In some ways I was impressed, and in some ways I was disappointed. It's a fun little movie as long as you can get past the fact that literally nothing makes any sense. And I don't just mean the basic suspension of disbelief required to watch a movie about an alien invasion; I mean that even within it's own universe, much of what happens in the film makes no sense. Why do these aliens need to come to Earth for gold? Gold isn't a particularly rare element in the universe; there are plenty of uninhabited planets and asteroids out there that have gold, and these aliens clearly have the ability to go wherever they want. Why go through the trouble of capturing hundreds of humans 'to find their weaknesses' when it's totally obvious from the very beginning that people are no match in any way for the alien technology and are easily killed? Doesn't it make more sense to lay low and just kill anyone who happens upon their operation rather than going out and making their presence known? Even if the aliens' end game was to invade the planet, at that point in history nobody would have been able to do much about it if the aliens just went about their business. How did that bracelet weapon fit Daniel Craig's human wrist so perfectly when it was clearly designed for the much larger alien wrists? How can his brain operate it when it was made to interface with the alien brain? After freeing the prisoners on the ship, why did Olivia Wilde sneak off and head for the core without Daniel Craig when she needed the bracelet in order to carry out her plan, and he still had it on? Did she just assume he'd find her? Pretty big assumption considering that her whole entire plan, which she traveled from another planet to execute, depended on it. And if the only way to destroy the core was with one of those bracelets, how was she planning on getting her hands on one if Daniel Craig hadn't very accidentally stumbled onto one and then escaped? It didn't really seem like she was working towards any kind of goal at the beginning of the movie. SO MANY QUESTIONS! It just makes me wonder how movies like this can even get made. Doesn't anyone read the script? I mean, these would be easy corrections. Surely for the $165 million you'd think someone would at least try to make sure there weren't huge holes in the plot. I don't know, maybe Favreau has been spending too much time with George Lucas.But still, it's not all bad. The effects are great, the aliens are sufficiently weird looking and the cast is solid. Worth watching on cable.",Cowboys & Aliens
172,merylmatt,Bad to the Bone,1,31 December 2011,"Thank heaven I saw this on cable & did not pay for it. Holy smokes, this was predictable, already done, clichéd.**Spoiler Alerts**the character played by Oliva Wilde is an alien - it is so heavily foreshadowed, it clunks you on the head. She's there because the bad aliens killed all of her species & she wants to stop them (Uh, Star Trek, the Borg?) Speaking of foreshadowing, whatya think happens when Harrison Ford gives the boy his knife - gosh, is the kid gonna become a man when he kills an alien? You betcha! Native American guide is able to unite cowboys and Indians to fight together against the aliens. Together, they dodge, out run and out smart the aliens who have laser blasters. Since movies like this need a sacrificial victim, the guide gives his life to say everyone else.The alien weakness? They don't see so good in the day time (Predator, anyone?).Oh, and a LSD like trance induced by the witch doctor helps Daniel Craig remember where he got the killing bracelet and what happened to his wife that will lead to save the day.The climatic attack on the alien spaceship frees the hostages and everyone is able to outrun a spaceship blowing up.Cowboys Vs Aliens deserves to be on a short list of worst movies ever, but won't become a cult classic like Attack of the Killer Tomatoes or Planet X.",Cowboys & Aliens
173,trimbolicelia,Cowboys & Aliens (2011),9,2 May 2021,"Thoroughly enjoyed this film. Unlikely combination of the ""Old West"" and sci-fi. A gunslinger wakes up disoriented, suffering from amnesia, and with a strange metal cuff on his wrist. He makes his way to a town where eventually the evil space aliens make their violent attack and capture several townsfolk. The gunman and several townspeople go off to rescue their people along with a mysterious woman with her own personal agenda. Several incidents and adventures ensue. Harrison Ford as the hard as nails rancher is great, and Daniel Craig as gunman is very impressive. Instinctual, hard and monosyllabic, but with a humane side. A lot of reviews are complimentary, but a lot are negative. To the negatives I would say enjoy this film for what it is, a fun popcorn movie. It's not a documentary. So what if two genres are mixed. The Western parts are very well done. The sci-fi parts are good but the aliens look a bit of a mess and hard to make out, second to the icky aliens in Battle: Los Angeles. Very recommended.",Cowboys & Aliens
174,MovieSonic,Decent action flick,7,20 November 2011,"I'm not sure why a huge wave of negativity surrounded this film when it was released because it's just a decent film.I was looking forward to watching it when I first heard about it and then ""people"" kept saying it was bad (i.e. ""reviews"") and I waited for the DVD.It doesn't matter that it's a western, it's nowhere near as bad as the weird ""past and future combined"" thing that ""Priest"" did.I didn't care about the lead female character even a little bit. She got more interesting later on though.The only issue with this film is that there is literally no emotional involvement with anyone.But I don't think anyone will watch this film for the story aspect, I think people will watch for the action and there's plenty of that.It's entertaining and worth watching.I would suggest though that this may have been better as a tongue-in-cheek film. Maybe some comedy would have made the film seem less preposterous? For example ""Wild Wild West"". I think ""Cowboys and Aliens"" tried to be too serious and this sucked some of the enjoyment out because people who want alien-action don't necessarily want serious western-drama.Oh and Daniel Craig plays James Bond. Not a bad thing but not a relateable character in this film.My vote: 7",Cowboys & Aliens
175,durham100,A bitter disappointment.,3,13 August 2011,"I won't outline the story as many other reviews have done that. It seems to me like Hollywood wanted to do another alien invasion movie and after realising just about every concept has been explored someone said - I know, let's set it in cowboy times! The fact that it is set in the old west progresses the story no further and really makes no difference at all - I can't think of one reason why it could not have been set in modern times other than the fact that if it had been, it would have looked so similar to so many other movies and would probably have not been made.Add to this a big nod to the ""prey"" video game, the ""Halo"" series and a reworking of the Independence Day finale and there is nothing at all new in this film which is very disappointing considering the talent behind and in front of the camera.There's nothing wrong with the acting - Olivia Wilde is very good and stunningly attractive, Harrison Ford is a pleasing, grizzled bad guy but at times almost slips back to being Indie -(it was fun to see towards the end of the movie during an escape he was actually ahead of James Bond! Life in the old dog yet!) Daniel Craig is OK but doesn't really bring anything special to the table and the monsters are pretty good but it's all been done before.Hard to believe Mr. Spielberg is involved but when you think he was also behind Falling Skies (again adequate as a time passer but not what you'd expect from the master) maybe he is losing his magic touch.I read that the budget was $163,000,000! That is crazy if true! The special effects are OK but not THAT special and most of the first two thirds of the film is talk and shots across the desert of people riding horses which means the majority of the cash must have gone on actors and the director I guess. The fact that this cost so much yet delivers so little reduces it from 2 out of 10 to 1 out of 10.",Cowboys & Aliens

It could have been a 4 star film if maybe the played with the narrative earlier on but the plot itself is actually quite good and the best bit is the whole blowout at the end. Daniel Craig is brilliant in this film as being himself an Englishman his American accent is really good and his character as this mysterious lone ranger is portrayed really well. Harrison Ford does not disappoint as his supporting role is really good that he almost comes to the same level as Craig (in referring to the amount of focus the film has on the characters). Oliva Wilde is good, at first seems like an ultimate stalker for wherever Craig is at the beginning she is right behind him...being stalkerish. But she turns out to be not such a creep as she appears to be later on. The appealing thing about this film is the generic hybrid of the western and alien invasion genre and it's interesting to see how people of a western era react to an alien invasion, instead of seeing how people of the present day react (as it has been done before, not a bad thing though) so if you're unsure about this film, it doesn't hurt to check it out!

Pretty much a set-piece action-porn flick, but with a huge budget. I heard about this reading on Favreau's movie Chef, a much better use of your time and his money. I also read somewhere that Favreau was mad at some famous actor who dissed this movie when it came out, as if that could have really accounted for the flop. No, all of SAG praising this turkey would not have made it watchable.Because Hollywood types live in this make-believe netherworld they have no idea how real humans beings would behave. They also have little understanding of how aliens would behave. Here is a realistic re-write. Big alien ship lands in the desert. OK they start drilling for gold, lets allow that stupidity. The Indians are a little freaked. The aliens start grabbing up a few Indians to eat, mmmmmm red meat. Then as they scout around, they notice the giant cattle ranch. Cattle are way meatier than Indians so they take all the cattle and start eating them. This would actually provide some interesting dynamic, when the big-man-on-campus cattle baron has all his cattle taken away. Suddenly he has no wealth, no power, no jobs. Lets see how people treat him then. Now he might have a reason to go fight the aliens. He sure would have not risked his life for his milquetoast son.As the aliens quietly mine for gold and munch on cattle, the locals work themselves into a lather. The aliens don't have to abduct anyone to do anal probing, they know all they need to from the first few Indians they ate. Stick a giant claw into a human and he dies. Research complete. Let's eat.OK, OK, so the townspeople and Indians join together and attack the Alien spaceship. Since these creatures have the capacity for interstellar travel, they sure don't need to engage in hand-to-hand combat. No, they just zap every human in about 3 minutes and the humans are all dead. Also, since the Aliens have surely mastered genetics, they don't look like crude creepy turtle-people. They all look like TV newscasters, all of them. So with their chiseled features and great enunciation, slowly but surely the audience begins to sympathize with them, instead of those dirty townspeople or savage Indians.So by the time the movie ends, we are delighted the TV newscaster aliens have killed all the humans, eaten all the cattle, and taken all the gold. Based on this level of narcissism and rapaciousness, we will no doubt nominate them to political office where they can start wars to kill more humans and graft more gold.Roll credits.I once read that the writers of a situation comedy reach creative bankruptcy when they do the ""amnesia episode"". I agree, so that aspect has to go. Also the alien-as-pretty-girl trope. That way you don't get distracted for 12 minuets wondered ""How the hell did she get here?!"" It is already a completely ridiculous premise, so chopping up the timeline just makes it more confusing. Straighten out the timeline, like a good B-movie. Fire all the high-dollar actors. Replace Daniel Craig with some young teen idol. I don't know who that is these days, but like DeCaprio 20 years ago. One star, one big paycheck. Cut the casting budget. Five townspeople, five Indians, three aliens. No dogs or kids, its tough enough having horses on set.20 million budget, 85 million domestic gross. Plenty of action figure tie-ins. Maybe a ride at Universal Studios where you ride a mechanical horse up to the spaceship and then get tasered. Legal has to work out some kinks, but I think it would really go big.

179,skullislandsurferdotcom,Laserblast Revisited,1,30 July 2011,"In the beginning, there's a cowboy movie. A man from nowhere, Daniel Craig, wakes up with a device on his wrist – then he's surrounded by three rough necks – followed by a quick, neat fight straight out of the opening scene of SILVERADO. He wanders into a small town, where a few more characters are set-up, and it feels like the kind of Western we love to watch, perhaps even something by Sergio Leone – that's the attempt, anyway. We meet the town brat, overplayed by Paul Dano, whose father, Harrison Ford, is a cattle baron with lots of money. All these and more folks are introduced, so many it's hard to keep track.Then the aliens, in speedy vessels with lasers, and even lassos, attack: computer animation meets the scant Western setting. When a posse is formed, and the cowboys venture to kill the formidable foes, the pace flags. But it's when Craig's gorgeous love interest, supposedly the town whore, becomes ""enlightened"" by Indians and knows everything about the aliens... spouting exposition like directions on a new stove... that the film sinks beneath the surface of banality, completely losing its rough and tumble origins to a science-fiction melodrama.Daniel Craig, attempting the iconic Clint Eastwood Man With No Name, is so tiny he's lost in his big hat. He juts his lips and hisses each line, and while this seems to work for James Bond, his performance as a mysterious stranger doesn't hold water. Harrison Ford, with a gruff, world-weary voice and a bitter hatred for mankind, seems to be doing a performance or imitation. The aliens, free from their ships and computer animated to the hilt, are too quick and dangerous to be worthy foes – thus Craig's wristband gun comes to play, making the other riders (and way too many of them) useless.The only involving performance is by Clancy Brown as a wise, tough preacher, but alas, he makes but a quarter of the trip: one that starts with a quick bang and ends with a very long whimper. So here's one ""spoiler"" to sum things up – the girl eventually turns into a hummingbird, an image more stupid than the convoluted back story of our hero and the aliens, which is still completely unclear.For More Interviews: http://cultfilmfreakreviews.blogspot.com",Cowboys & Aliens

Together. At the same time. As cowboys. How on earth do you mess that up? Just watch Cowboys & Aliens and you'll find out.A summary first: Cowboys & Aliens is about, well, cowboys and aliens. When 1873 Arizona is invaded by aliens, it's up to the cowboys and natives, led by Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig) and Colonel Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford), to save the Wild West.On paper, this is a great film. It has all the makings of a really fun action movie. Cast, crew, budget, story, everything is there to make it a success. And yet it's not. Cowboys & Aliens is boring, that's the problem. It plods along, never really being as funny or as action-packed as it wants to be. There are a few good moments, but not enough to save the movie.The biggest disappointment is Harrison Ford. While Craig is actually quite good in his role as the take-no-prisoners, wise-cracking anti-hero, Ford is really wasted. His stereotypical humorously gruff persona was perfect for this; instead, he's gruff without the humour, and that's not great. Olivia Wilde, despite her 'shocking' character twist, is rubbish. Sam Rockwell and Paul Dano (both actors I really like) are wasted.The one strength of this movie is the special effects.

Cowboys & Aliens is different to anything I've ever watched it's I think not very predictable at all and is just enjoyable to watch a good old twist on country western with the added modern near future spin. Daniel Craig plays his role great As does Harrison ford (as always) I really do believe this film deserves more credit then it got I was always put off watching it after hearing people saying how boring it was and just complete and utter nonsense.

It really doesn't. What I liked about Cowboys is that it has a decent blend of Sci-Fi and Wild West. Overall the cinematography looks good, and the movie has a nice look and feel. Also Olivia Wild, and Daniel Craig and fill their rolls very well. This is why I see a lot of great potential in Cowboys and Aliens. The script is also good to start, but loses depth further along in the film.Normally I would give a movie like this an 8 on average. The reason I gave this a 7 is because of two things. Adam Beach, and Harrison Ford. Both great actors in their own respect. They simply clashed with this film. The producers probably chose Beach because he is Indian, and his character is Indian. The problem? That doesn't mean he's great for the roll. I could get over him though. Harrison Ford just doesn't fit. He's not dark, or scary enough, and his voice has to much 70's jive in his mouth. People in the wild west, in his position were much rougher. They should have made him chew on barbed wire before each shot ;)Lastly the aliens. Come on? They just weren't scary.

Cowboys & Aliens is almost exactly what it sounds like; a movie about cowboys & aliens. But when you watch it, the plot thickens and becomes something in the vein of ""Inception,"" having many twists and turns that ultimately lead to one big concluding fact.The story is not the only thing to praise; characters help shape the plot for this movie. Daniel Craig was perfect as Jake Lonergan, a man who has lost memory and sets out on his own personal quest to find out his identity, but not before running into trouble in the little town of Absolution, where a bounty on his head has been presented to the sheriff. Then there's Harrison Ford as Col. Woodrow Dolarhyde, the man Jake supposedly stole gold from, and happens to be the one who 'controls' the town. Throughout the movie, their relationships change with the other characters as they begin to realize what kind of men they are meant to be.Overall, with the original take on the sci-fi & western genres, a classical score, memorable characters, and a witty script, Cowboys & Aliens has proved itself to be a fantastic summer blockbuster and hopefully will become a franchise, having much more to explore as there are still holes to be filled and conflicts to be resolved.9/10 Stars***",Cowboys & Aliens
184,mobadizhere,Underrated sci-fi Western!,8,10 September 2018,"Cowboys and Aliens was actually shot near where I live, I remember when they were filming this, when I was near that location there would be alot of loud sounds followed by blinking lights.

185,ty-jensen,Good but not great,7,29 July 2012,"Cowboys and Aliens stars Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford. Daniel's role was written for Robert Downey Jr. whom was interested but he had to drop out to do Sherlock Holmes 2 which is a good movie, better than the first. The plot is Daniel's character wakes up in the outskirts of some town with amnesia, it doesn't take long for him to find out he's an outlaw, he meets a grumpy rancher played by Harrison and the town is attacked by aliens.I understand why some hate this movie. I think it's good but not great. Combining the western genre and the science fiction genre is unique but the plot is certainly not new. The plot is weak but it's not a big deal. It's nothing more than fighting aliens and Daniel's character uncovering his past. Some think every character is weak and that's fine but I feel there is some character development , specifically the leads.The aliens are CG creatures, practical creatures would have been nice, they are bland and that means they are just targets, blips or whatever to shoot while on your way to work or maybe the dentist. Not showing the aliens in the marketing was a nice idea, some trailers like to show everything. The Super 8 marketing didn't show the alien and hopefully this ""showing the whole movie"" phase or period will die.How is the action? It's explosive and clear. I hate shaky cam and it's probably worth mentioning I didn't mind the shaky cam in The Bourne Supremacy. Nothing new happens and surprisingly there is some blood.Is is worth seeing? I feel it's worth a chance, it was made as a popcorn flick from the beginning. I seen it only once and I see myself watching it only once more.",Cowboys & Aliens
186,med77_99,"Cowboys, Indians and ... Aliens ?",9,29 July 2011,"I thought that would have made a better title for the film than just Cowboys and Aliens. Anyways, I just came back from watching this movie, I have to say, I was more than satisfied.Just imagine if you put James Bond "" Craig "" and Indiana Jones "" Ford "" in a Western Sci fi, what would you get ? A definitely original and entertaining Action / Adventure film.While the idea is not entirely original, as it has been done before, but i must say not with Favreau's style and not with this brilliant cast.the movie starts immediately with Daniel Craig's character who wakes up in the middle of no where with amnesia, and finds an electric bracelet around his wrist, which seems to be a weapon of some sort, and so that mystery captures the attention of viewers and audience early on. the plot moves in a steady pace, introducing us to all the different characters, including Harrison Ford's character who plays a gangster who seems to have crossed paths with Craig's character before he lost his memory.the characters were all very well defined with clear goals and motives, and the chemistry between them was strong. I was particularly very interested in Ford and his fellow Indian right hand guy relationship.the cast delivered very memorable performances, and Harrison Ford was much better here than his role in Mornning Glory. Daniel Craig, Sam Rockwell and Olivia Wilde were all very good here.the Action was executed in a very good way, mixing old school stunt with a little special effects. not a lot of CGI too which was something refreshing to see in an action sci fi nowadays.the story was simple but intriguing, never dragged or felt boring. it involves Aliens who keep attacking humans in a small town and start abducting people, that of course takes place in the old West, which forces the two seemingly enemies "" Ford "" and "" Craig "" to join forces against that Alien attack.I highly recommend this movie, definitely original and entertaining. with a very good cast and the direction of Jon Favreau who adds a lot to the film, with some solid action scenes. not to be missed, i can safely say, this was my favorite movie this summer 2011 so far !!9 out of 10.",Cowboys & Aliens
187,holyspiritdriven,Good Twist on the Alien Invasion Plot,7,17 January 2012,"You can almost see the smile on the face of whomever had the idea for this story as they shared the idea for the first time. It does sound a little ridiculous, but I actually like the concept. So many movies are really just the same thing with different actors: humans battle invading alien forces. I like thinking outside the box: what if the aliens invaded back in the 1800's? It's really interesting to think about how people of that time would view them & try to fight them. The story didn't exactly go like I thought it would but that was good, it wasn't totally predictable. There a few things I would have done differently, for example, have the cowboys & Indians beat the aliens based on their own strategies & methods rather than using the alien's own technology against them (that way there is good reason for the setting). All in all the movie was entertaining & not just another alien invasion movie.",Cowboys & Aliens
188,Mischief810,How can anyone not like this movie?,10,11 December 2014,"It is well acted. It is well produced. It has a star-studded cast and a fun twist on sci-fi action thrillers. Here's what you do for a ""summer fun"" movie: Combine a bunch of cowpokes with a hostile alien race, set it in a time period where the human race has no concept of time or space travel. Then let Spielberg do his thing.I've had fun watching this film several times. As with all good flicks, there's always something you missed the first, second and third times. This isn't really meant to be serious science fiction. It's meant to be an entertaining romp that mashes up the western and sci-fi genre, and it throws in just enough action and special effects to make up for a so-so script.If you watch this and don't like it, then you don't like watching fun movies. This. Was. Fun.",Cowboys & Aliens
189,Reel_starz,Pure escapism that could have been more,6,4 August 2011,"Depending on whom you asked, the premise of Jon Favreau's latest summer tentpole movie sounded either brilliant or ridiculous: cowboys band together to fight invading aliens. The title pretty much said it all. Regardless, it was a nifty idea to capitalize on the latest out-of-nowhere geek fascination with cowboys and aliens (which is topped only by the ongoing pirates-v.-ninjas debate), and, especially coming from the director of Iron Man, it seemed all but guaranteed to work, at least in terms of box office. If nothing else, it was going to be fun, a high-budget Syfy original. The real question was whether it would transcend its gimmick and prove that high-concept genre mash-ups could be legitimately thoughtful and fresh or become just another example of the disposable escapism that currently dominates the summer movie season. It starts out promising. Like the ubiquitous trailer, the movie opens with our unidentified hero waking up in the middle of a desert, a mysterious device strapped to his wrist. He is confronted by a band of suspicious cowboys, all of whom he takes out with Jason Bourne-like ease, and he silently rides away on a horse taken from one of his unconscious foes. This exchange, set to a beautifully atmospheric score by Harry Gregson-Williams, demonstrates the taut simplicity that embodies Cowboys and Aliens at its most engrossing because, as pretentious as it may sound, the movie is best when nothing much is going on. On the surface, Favreau and his screenwriters, a group that includes Alex Kurtzman and Robert Orci, who somehow managed to pen both the 2009 Star Trek reboot and Michael Bay's Transformers movies, seem to understand the key elements of a Western. The locale is suitably barren and dusty, the dialogue is blunt and to-the-point, and the pacing is brisk. The characters never quite rise above traditional archetypes (the man-of-few-words, the mysterious dame, the determined lawman), but they're likable and interesting enough that we feel invested in their fates. Some viewers may be surprised by the lack of humor, but for me, this was the right approach. How could we take the movie seriously if it didn't take itself seriously?Unfortunately, that is the high point. Once the aliens arrive, kicking off the main plot, the movie forgets what made it charming in the first place. Sure, it's entertaining, and the action sequences, while still on the unremarkable side, are infinitely superior to those in the Iron Man movies, but when the credits roll and the adrenaline wears off, it's obvious that something is missing. It took a while for me to determine what exactly that something was, yet writing this review, it's becoming more and more apparent: in the end, why should the audience care? Although some may argue that Favreau accomplished what he set out to do, which was to provide a fun way to consume a couple hours, Cowboys and Aliens had the potential to be so much more than that, and something tells me that the film-makers had more in mind than diverting fluff. In interviews, Favreau has insisted that one reason, if not the reason, for making Cowboys and Aliens is a desire to revive the western, a once-beloved genre that now struggles to stay relevant. It's certainly an admirable goal, but I can't say their efforts pay off. While all the tropes are there, from the prostitute with a heart of gold to the minor plot line involving settler-Indian relations, the movie ignores one crucial fact: westerns aren't about gunfights or gold; they're about people searching for meaning and order in a chaotic, unforgiving landscape. At first, Cowboys and Aliens seems to acknowledge this, but after the science-fiction aspect takes over, the characters and the conflicts presented at the beginning are pushed aside in favor of a mediocre monster story, and the tension dissipates. The instant the cowboys unite to fight the aliens, apparently ignoring their personal rivalries and grudges, all signs of internal struggle and moral ambiguity vanish. The best westerns are defined by engaging, often unpredictable characters and their interactions as well as the sizzling chemistry between the actors who portray them. If Cowboys and Aliens possessed either, it's not evident by the end of the first hour. The casting of both Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford, James Bond and Indiana Jones, respectively, promised hostile confrontations and scenery-chewing, but they share so little screen-time that you don't even remember that they're supposed to be bonding with each other until the very last scene. For what it's worth, Daniel Craig is the only member of the cast that stands out. I'll admit that I'm not a fan of his James Bond – or any James Bond, for that matter – but he is enthralling as the brooding Jake Lonergan, lending his rather dispassionate character a discreet yet touching vulnerability, and his screen presence is formidable. Otherwise, the actors are merely solid. Harrison Ford doesn't have much to do besides scowl and grumble, and Sam Rockwell (who was, by the way, easily the best thing about Iron Man 2) is woefully underused (again) as the mild-mannered doctor. The main rough spot is Olivia Wilde. Despite, or perhaps because of, her exotic beauty, she is never credible as a tough, enigmatic rebel out for revenge; even though the movie takes place in the wild west, it's hard to believe she could hold her own against her more rugged male counterparts. From the beginning, it's obvious who's going to win, and maybe that's part of the problem. Without any compelling character-based conflicts, the stakes feel almost nonexistent. The lives of loved ones hang in the balance, yet for some reason, the aliens come off more as nuisances than legitimate threats; not once can I recall wondering whether our protagonists will survive. Ultimately, as the anticlimactic finale dwindles into an unrewarding conclusion, you're left wondering what the point was. Yeah, the ride was pretty fun, but really, so what?",Cowboys & Aliens

Yes, the town and the costumes were great, but a number of good actors are here (it has a great cast) and they just didn't get enough good material to work with. Also, too many character clichés - the pragmatic preacher, the sheriff bucking the overlord, the overlord's boneheaded son, the 'stranger' who is a reformed bad guy AFTER a bump on the head, the climax inside the alien spaceship - to make this more than two hours of mildly escapist entertainment. One reviewer wrote that this would have made a great STRAIGHT western, and I agree.Despite the attractive scenery and outdoor photography, viewers are probably better off with the original material or other classics such as UNFORGIVEN, THE SEARCHERS or HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER.

193,MarcusJ13,A new idea that eventually got plagued by old concepts,7,28 August 2011,"I thought it was interesting that someone decided that these two could mix and thought done properly could end up becoming a modern day classic. While this film builds a great deal of tension in the beginning with our protagonist and wanted man Jake (Daniel Craig) showing himself to be ruthless cowboy unafraid of taking any action he pleases. He has also lost his memory unaware of any crimes he has committed. Something in which I am glad they did as I was afraid that they would make him out to be too much of a law abiding cowboy with a slight dark side. We know what he is and we are supposed to root for him but there is a large villainous side to him. I am glad they took this approach. Anyway while at the start they took this approach I was expecting a fairly dark film. Although later on there are pockets of humour inserted in. I minded this at first but as the film progressed I realised it was a good thing it didn't take itself too seriously. Craig does do well in the role and the rest of the characters do play off him quite well. When the aliens do arrive while the action scenes were fairly standard the effects were brilliant and didn't look like plain Computer Generated Images. Due to this the action scenes looked very good on screen. Harrison Ford was the most memorable character in my opinion though with a performance only he can give really stealing the show in many scenes. Olivia Wilde was okay I just wish they'd written her character better then we might have had a more dynamic female lead, something which this film was sorely missing. The inevitable romance between her and Jake played out as standard but fortunately didn't drag the story down. Going back to effects the aliens themselves looked brilliant and quite unique managing to look genuinely scary bringing some frightening moments. Not to mention being looking very realistic. The reason I say old concepts about this film is because it plays out just how you would expect it too. Maybe I was expecting too much but it needed something more in order to make it memorable and be a little less predictable. On paper it looked like it could be really dynamic and deliver as it turns out it failed to. On the other hand it is enjoyable despite sliding between slightly light hearted and taking itself seriously. Thankfully though the film is entertaining with some fantastic action scenes and suspense. If you are looking for a decent film to enjoy without being too up itself give this a try.",Cowboys & Aliens

I put myself in a ""relax, and don't think too hard about it"" mood, and the end result was that the film was very enjoyable.I had grown somewhat tired of watching Harrison Ford on screen, so I was not expecting him to be worth seeing. That's not the case here. He's perfect for the role he plays.I wasn't at all prepared for James Bond...uh, I mean Daniel Craig in a western. Again, I was quite surprised to find that he was perfectly cast as the not-so-good hero. In fact, I can't imagine any other actor playing the role better than he did. I should have had more faith in him, as he is one of our finest actors.The special effects, photography, directing, dialog, and acting are all much better than I would have expected in a film like this.

With such a high production involvement with 4 major production companies as well other well known it is very expensive project, and with also so many involvements in making the script. Well known director and list of famous actors simply put you on state to at least watch it.With the start of the movie, it was obvious that it was made in traditional western genre, and for that I am pleased, but still I can't manage to accept Sci Fi mixed with it. No matter how good is made or how good script is. The script is good, but nothing new or original as from the few sequences from the start you realize how it will end.I must admit that movie is made very well and probably had an intention to be a one summer hit.I did not see it in complete, but as much I saw, the CG were very good, acting were not such great from main actors, but overall as a blockbuster movie I think it hit the spot.No matter how good everything looks I just can't accept it, probably because it enters very sensitive area, and it is classic American cinema genre which simply can't be mixed with something like Sci-Fi.Maybe for someone it is an open eyer or something amazing, but not for me.

Yet, your movie was not one bit funny as the title or ads suggested. You did not try to make this comic of yours a comedy.

197,janus-20,"Oater this world or oater space, a choice of very poor puns for a GOOD movie.",8,20 August 2011,"Wow i enjoyed this, partially due to the negative reviews here on IMDb (thanks guys) and in part due to Harrison Ford clearly having more fun with a character than he has in a long time.Its not a perfect film and there are questions that could be asked of some of the plot points, but the questions, such as they are, would require irrelevant exposition, which would only serve to hobble the pace of what is essentially a ""Men (and Woman) on a mission"" movie. What really stands out for me were the scenes at the beginning of the film, Jon Favreau introduces the characters, locations and situations in such a manner that when the real threat manifests itself, despite the films title, it catches you as off guard as the characters are.The cast are all great, some nice character work from Clancy Brown and Keith Carradine. Daniel Craig brings the stoic, no nonsense aspects of his Bond to Jake and as i said earlier Harrison Ford obviously relishes the role of Dolarhyde.It reminds me of the films i used to enjoy about twenty years ago, that had lively pace, but were'nt frantic. The effects are special, but not overblown or overwhelming to the point where they become the focus thereby obviating any interest in the characters stories. I don't want to talk about the story too much and spoil it, i'd just urge you to go and watch it, because this movie is an honest attempt to try something a little different. Its not Superheroes, its not a TV show, its not a line of toys and its not cute animated whatevers.

198,TourettesPersonal,Title Says It All,6,13 August 2011,"It's easy to figure out what Cowboys & Aliens is going to be. I'm not familiar with the comic book that it's based on but the film is definitely what the title has promised us. There are cowboys, then there are aliens. If you are fond to Western movies then you'll be entertained but if you are expecting too much aliens then you might get disappointed. You won't be seeing anything mind blowing in this film. If you want to see Sci-Fi action plus Western Violence then this film is just for you.Cowboys & Aliens is nothing but to entertain you. The only thing that is unique here is the Western & Sci-Fi collaboration. The film is just your typical Western movie but instead of Indians or some sadistic bandit, the aliens are the antagonist of the film. The aliens are pretty intriguing but we don't see them that much until the third act. It's disappointing if you are expecting too much aliens. The only things we see them do are ride their ships, stab people, shoot with their weapons, & jump scare the audiences. It's also your typical alien invasion film.At least the action is full of explosions. Jon Favreau sure knows how to make the action scenes exciting no matter how flawed they are. The performances saved most of the film. Daniel Craig's character is actually bland in the script so does Olivia Wilde's, but Craig's performance gives a little more character to the role. I don't know what to say about Olivia Wilde's, she is just hot. Harrison Ford & Sam Rockwell do what they do best. Paul Dano can be both fun to watch and annoying at the same time.It's easy to recognize that the CGI effects were made by Industrial Light & Magic, since the CGI aliens looks just like any monster from J.J. Abram's films. No doubt, it's good. The score is true to its western themes. The production design is pretty decent enough for a western film.In the end, Cowboys & Aliens is just another blockbuster released to our cinemas. I don't know if this film is going to be remembered years from now but I think the only purpose of this film is to show its gritty western violence and some sci-fi action. If you're expecting more than the title then you will be disappointed. If you are expecting more aliens than the cowboys then you'll be disappointed. Cowboys are the focus and the aliens end up being the jump scare of the movie. It's not bad nor good though. If you are careless about the story and the character development, & you're just seeking for some sheer action and huge explosions then I can recommended this. But not quite.",Cowboys & Aliens
199,bigcalkenobi,Cowboys and Aliens is a pretty good western and an overall decent movie that will keep audiences engaged and curious.,8,31 July 2011,"The western genre was all but defeated when science fiction broke through to the mainstream with films like Star Wars in the 1970s and 80s. This is mostly because the tried and true formula of westerns was getting very stale and science fiction offered a way to tell similar stories in flashier and more robust ways. Many ideas and themes from old westerns still resurface from time to time these days(Firefly, Serenity) and once an a while there will be some very good westerns that manage to make their way into the theaters(3:10 to Yuma, Appaloosa, No Country for Old Men, True Grit) and become cult hits. With all of this said it was very intriguing that Jon Favreau as well as an all-star production team and an all star cast would be working together to make a movie that merged the western genre with the genre that essentially killed westerns. Cowboys and Aliens may seem like a ridiculous concept but because of all of the big names attached to the project it seems just as ambitious as it is intriguing. With writers Damon Lindelof(Lost; Star Trek), Alex Kurtzman(Fringe, Star Trek), and Robert Orci(Fringe, Star Trek), producer Ron Howard(Apollo 13, A Beautiful Mind), director Jon Favreau(Iron Man), and the all star cast Daniel Craig(Casino Royale), Harrison Ford(Indiana Jones, Star Wars), Olivia Wilde(Tron Legacy), and Sam Rockwell(Iron Man 2, Moon) this movie definitely seemed to have more potential than most other films that were hitting the big screen this summer.

How can a film directed by Favreau (The Mandalorian, Elf, MCU work, Chef, Disney live action rebooted films etc.) be this flat? When you have Harrison Ford ( doing a strange impression of Dennis Quaid doing an angry old man), Daniel Craig, Paul Dano, Sam Rockwell, Olivia Wilde, Keith Carradine, and a bunch of great character actors like Clancy Brown, you should have an amazing hit on your hands.Unfortunately the whole is not equal to the sum of its parts. Too many clunky western tropes (spoiled and dangerous son of a cattle Baron, pistol packing damsel, beleaguered sheriff, meek shopkeeper who becomes a hero) and not enough alien engagement makes this too slow. And even though there's significant character development, there's still no dramatic tension, as the end is never in doubt. You don't care much about the horrific things the characters have experienced. The hidden alien reveal at the end feels weak and for me was a big let down. And the explanation as to how Craig acquired his alien gauntlet is almost forgotten, and therefore meaningless.One of the things I look for in alien invasion films that focus on mayhem and destruction by monsters from ""out there"" is the alien motivation (here it's planet resources-not very original); and how the monstrous alien attackers could also have the intellect and sophistication to travel through space, and create advanced tech. That's absurdly missing in this film. Almost mindless (and naked) marauding alien monsters, who somehow traveled through space to perpetrate an advanced plan. Travel to another planet and then engage in gory hand-to-hand combat that ends with eating the victims? Uh...no.IMO the producers forgot that the target audience wasn't the niche fan base of an almost unknown graphic novel, but actually science fiction fans who want to see something flashy early on to whet their palate.Bummer.

206,Jumbajookiba,A seriously underrated movie,8,25 August 2020,"What can I say? An average 6.0 rating is undeserved. This is a great movie, imaginative, exciting, fun and not filled with the usual cliches.
The acting is marvellous from the entire cast, the effects are pretty good. It's well thought out and believable, I end up watching it every time it turns up on TV now. There is the right amount of bloodshed and violence, not over the top and no silly side love story to slow the pace down.
I would recommend this movie.",Cowboys & Aliens
207,mike_brunton,"Clichéd, generic, badly written thriller",6,24 November 2011,"Oh boy, months waiting for a movie to come out and when it does it just feels kinda tame. There is something to be said for certain clichés, unfortunately for a cliché to really pay it has to be superbly acted. We also have to really care about the results of this acting. For example, Harrison Ford's character comes across as a racist, grumpy, greedy idiot. Result, he would have been better off being killed off in the first Alien attack on the village. Daniel Craig was an all but two dimensional hard man, without an Inner city Glasgae twang or a real sense of uncontrolled violence to really bring it off (hint stick to James Bond). This is a man who ran an outlaw gang of 30 men? He wakes up with a bracelet of fire on his wrist. Like an RPG game, but instantly giving away the fact that he had been already 'abducted' and no doubt rectally probed by the evil aliens. The aliens view us as insects...despite in 1876 or whatever already possessing weapons that can kill them. These aliens presumably all have awesome blasty bracelets of mass destruction but when it comes to an all-out attack on their mother spaceship - remember they are a scouting group for the whole civilization which is a gazillion light years away - respond by streaming out of their ship in the buff, yes with no arms or armor on. One would think a civilization 20,000 years ahead of us, could have designed some pretty amazing weaponry and tactics for dealing with the upset locals. The plot they were here for gold was no more interesting than any other movie, aliens are always here for some resource or other but never for peaceful trade. The movie got really ridiculous when Olivia Wilde suddenly 'came out' and admitted she as an alien too, but a shape shifting sort who could possess bodies, she was hot, and wow! We even got a screen kiss, but really. Questions could literally jump out of your brain, where did she come from? How did she get to earth? Didn't she realize it was unethical of her to possess another being, or was it okay being she was the town whore. I not saying this was a complete wash out, clearly the budget was there, but so unmemorable. A sad waste of vital resources. Once again Hollywood fails to impress. Hate to say these words, but currently I am playing Skyrim on the PS3. Awesome game, and an example of why games are taking over from the movie market. If Hollywood can't do better, a whole generation of younger people are going to seek out video games as a much more satisfying way to spend 2 hours on a Monday evening.",Cowboys & Aliens
208,brandonsullivan91,One horse galaxy,6,8 May 2015,"Fun movie. Cool concept. The story is thin but present. Motives for all parties make sense but aren't rich or layered. For example the aliens show up because they really want gold. OK, flimsy but it is a reason. I reckon the Cowboys wouldn't really know why these creatures showed up so how could the audience know? It's not like the aliens sent out a memo. So we just get to assume it's for fuel or building, who know's what. It is a fun one time watch if you are looking for an action movie and like sci-fi. It surprised me because I expected nothing and got a coherent movie within the boundaries it created. You also get to enjoy some big name stars that turn in decent work.",Cowboys & Aliens
209,Vezon123,Cowboys vs Aliens,6,13 August 2011,"The preacher looks the saloon-keeper in the eye and offers him friendly advice:get yourself a gun;learn how to use it. That's the Old West,put briefly. Then he teaches him. He tells him God wants him to mind his business. People are practical here,not even talk of demons lasts long. Maybe fighting evil should have been it,though,because Harrison Ford tells us manliness requires killing people who get in your way and putting people out of their misery. Love of one's own makes one as harsh as the wilderness.Cowboys,as seen in Westerns,must be paradigmatic of the human beings for the story to make sense. Bloodshed requires men;in battle,Harrison Ford charges an alien like a jousting knight. Then it emerges criminals and Indians will do,too. They all share in lawlessness and war. Our outlaw protagonist steals alien weaponry and follows his inclination to war. The woman,typically treacherous,turns out to be an alien. Apparently,the look and the being are very different. She looked beautiful,or else she would have been uninteresting,unpersuasive;but she has self-sacrifice on her mind,to save mankind. It seems that men's inability to understand the truth about her being goes with their need of her. But she is uninteresting,like a goddess in the machine.The aliens apparently want gold and experiment on human beings. They carbonize humans;and they also make them stare into a mesmerizing light that steals their minds,which helps Ford's bully of a son turn into a decent fellow.",Cowboys & Aliens

It then goes into a really cool dark and twisted what the heck is going on kind of film, leaving you in suspense. Frontier men women an children being taken or abducted by fast flying aliens is somewhat the premise, but the middle of the movie is really entertaining. Then... (sigh) I won't critique too bad because I liked them film, but I wasn't per-say a fan of the aliens design/look. Olivia Wilde character...? Who or what the heck is she?

211,peterlane5,Decent action sequences don't make up for the God-awful script.,3,30 July 2011,"""I want that man! You give him to me now, or I'm gonna take him!"" Plot: A man wakes up in the middle of the desert with a strange bracelet on his arm and no memory of who he is or what has landed him in this place. He makes his way to a nearby town where he learns he is a wanted man. Not long after, strange flying machines attack the town and begin to snatch up people left and right. After all of it is over the man, who's name is Jake teams up with a wealthy Civil War vet who's son was taken and a mysterious girl who believes she and Jake can help each other. With a gang of rag tag villagers and criminals, they set out to rescue the missing townspeople and uncover Jake's past. I can't, for the life of me understand why director Jon Favreau(Iron Man 1 & 2, Elf), or any other sane person for that matter would choose to commit to such a terrible script. I have really enjoyed Favreau's other work until now. It also amazes me that Ron Howard and Steven Spielberg were actually involved in this as well. You'd think with their talent, they would have stepped in and gotten a better screenwriter to rewrite it. Writer Roberto Orci who also wrote last year's disastrous Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, is back at it again and this time doing even worse. There's no doubt in my mind that he'll win the Razzie award for worst screenplay for the second time in a row. The plot never really takes off and just lumbers along for the entire two hour run time, not to mention the laugh out loud terrible twist. Every Western and Sci-fi cliché in the book is in here somewhere. I didn't care for any of the cardboard characters. There were many times when I either shook my head or laughed at how horrible it was. Terrible writing aside, the acting isn't much better. It is painful to watch Harrison Ford, my childhood hero, mumble awful dialogue throughout the entire movie. I ask you Mr. Ford, where are my heroes? Where is the Indiana Jones and Han Solo who I looked up to? Where?! Another person I was disappointed in was Sam Rockwell. I loved him in Moon and Iron Man 2, but all he does in this is shoot off unfunny one liners. Paul Dano, who has a lot of talent wastes it here by playing an unconvincing spoiled brat. And lastly Noah Ringer. I have heard he was terrible in The Last Airbender and I assume he's no better in this. He's just annoying. The entire time I kept thinking; ""Oh please just go back to the town so we don't have to hear your whining."" OK but awful stuff aside, this movie isn't a complete failure. I didn't find Daniel Craig's acting to be that good nor bad. He was just OK. I have never enjoyed action movies that much but I was impressed with all of the thrilling and exciting action sequences, even if most of them are downright cheesy. Add the always beautiful Olivia Wilde to the mix and at least you have something to look at. I was also impressed with the aliens even though after the first time we see them, they aren't very frightening. They look like a cross between the Super 8 monster, the Kraken from the remake of Clash of the Titans, and a fish. But all in all, if you're just going to see it for the action, you may have a good time, but if you pay attention to the writing whatsoever, then you'll absolutely hate it. This isn't the worst movie of the year(Battle: Los Angeles takes that spot), but it's definitely in my top five. Extremely disappointing. Total Score: 3.5/10",Cowboys & Aliens
212,kdorsey321,Cowboys & Aliens,8,4 January 2012,"Checked out the movie ""Cowboys & Aliens,"" starring Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and Olivia Wilde. I actually wanted to see this movie in the movie theater and didn't get a chance to. My first thoughts when I saw the previews of this movie were ""this looks cool."" The concept of cowboys and aliens going head to head, to me, was a very cool concept. When you looked at the preview, you wasn't a hundred percent sure what to expect. I thought that was good too!Surprisingly, this movie isn't too far fetched. I felt like they did a good job of keeping the story feasible. This film is enjoyable. It was also different too. Even though it does have its common alien moments. Parts that you've seen before and you figure will happen, but all in all, a pretty good film.I loved Harrison Ford's character(Woodrow Dolarhyde). He was a classic rooting tooting cowboy leader you would predict to be in this type of film. You could feel the natural cowboy nature in him. He did a great job of acting. There's a part were he's talking to the little boy in the ship and he cracks a baby smile, classic.I'm giving this film an 8 out of 10. I would say this is DVD worthy. I borrowed my friends DVD, but eventually I will own this movie. If you son't feel like its DVD worthy. Definitely check it out on Netflix's or Redbox it. Solid film.",Cowboys & Aliens
213,maddog-50,At least no crystal skull and Shia LaBeouff in it...,3,31 July 2011,"... but this was originally supposed to be a solid Western. At a certain time Spielberg thought that ""something special"" was missing in the script, so he gave it to Lucas for one week to have a look at it, and...well, the rest is history.It looks like that the CGI department had a hard time to fit Lucas funky Visions into a frame which would look a kind of appropriate to the 19th century. So this time they convinced the producers to leave the obligatory Jar Jar Binks-like character out. The alien ships therefore uses lassos instead of tractor beams and they are powered with Diesel engines with a lot of steam and smoke. And, they don't use mental powers and they are not Nazis!If this movie accidentally should have something to do with the original Cowboys & Aliens books, then its accidentally. Because nothing essential of Rosenberg's comics appears in the movie. Despite that, the movie is not that bad. I actually enjoyed it.The motivation of the producers was clearly to combine favorite genres and make an ""awesome"" summer blockbuster. It's terribly generic, the ETs are plain stupid and have probably not the slightest glue how they managed it to travel the light years distance to earth. They can easily be shot dead with a .45 Colt. They are so uninteresting as villains that you can cozily watch what Ford and Craig are doing together.",Cowboys & Aliens
214,rynlarson,Film is a well-acted Western with Aliens in it...not an alien invasion movie with cowboys in it/,8,30 July 2011,"I was pleasantly surprised with Cowboys and Aliens. After reading a few critics calling it ""dull"" and ""lifeless"" I was worried this would be a CGI riddled film where the action is so broad and large scale you become detached causing the dull reaction. I found it to be quite the opposite. Cowboys and Aliens is a ""Western"". People need to realize this before viewing. This is not an alien invasion movie so much as it is a Westerm where the Aliens are a part of the story of the town of Absolution and its inhabitants. Readers of this are probably saying huh? If this movie were a weekly TV episode that focused on a town called Absolution and its characters such as Jake and the Colonel and their story...and one of the weekly episodes has aliens in it..this may be a more accurate way to describe Cowboys and Aliens. I found it to be terrific. I imagine some of the disappointed reviewers went into the film expecting an alien invasion film that is set in the old west. When they find out it focuses on the Western I think it will disappoint a certain demographic of viewers.Daniel Craig & Harrison Ford are terrific in opposing roles. Ford, as usual, is able to tap into the emotional part of the story and draw the viewer into his story of redemption. Craig does more compelling work with his eyes than the wrist blaster and really impressed me. Without saying too much look for the scene between Adam Beach, Harrison Ford, and the Indian Chief and tell me that isn't Ford at his best since ""Air Force One"". The CGI is used right without overkill, the action is kept in perspective, and the cinematography is absolutely gorgeous.If you are looking for an adult Western with some terrific action sprinkled around a character driven script go see this film. It won't leave you disappointed.",Cowboys & Aliens

I kept thinking, ""Is this where the dog dies a heroically predictable death?"" That was my spoiler... the dog makes it (and we care). The title is a bit misleading. The Apaches are an integral part of the alien resistance coalition and play a predictably unpredictable part in the movie's spiritual essence (i.e. they get the hero stoned).Even the preacher was perfect. Low-key, super-nice bloke and basically an all around good guy that found the essential good in all he encountered.

It's a run of the mill western movie with some aliens thrown inside. Most of the time it looks like shot for TV, really uninspired stuff. That nothing really happens, doesn't help either. Really. Just riding horses, talking heads and exploding stuff. If there is any surprise, suspense or thrill to be found, i missed it. Even the aliens aren't great to look at. Just monsters like you've seen a thousand times before. Harrison Ford is playing some kind of villain here an i never noticed what a hack he can be, making faces all the time. He's really bad here, but not in the way he's supposed to. He definitely should call it a day soon. Daniel Craig looks quite ugly. Maybe it's the hat. But he presents a very fine pair of t*ts. An ugly guy with t*ts may be the perfect cast for a British secret agent, but i doubt back then in the good old west men sported pectorals like that. They just didn't knew how to grew them at that time. Well today they know. Craig is proof enough. Sam Rockwell is totally wasted here. Good for him.

The juxtaposition of cowboys and aliens seemed fresh and engaging and equaling appealing was the casting of Craig, Ford, and Wilde. Unfortunately, it failed to live up to the hype of my mind.The more I think about it, the more I realize that the most disappointing thing about this movie is how generic the aliens are. At one point Olivia Wilde's character comments that the aliens thinks humans are nothing more than insects. Yet, the irony is that the aliens are the bug-eyed ones. And you will get lots of interesting looks at what this director thinks aliens look like. I am fairly confident that if aliens ever did land here, they would be incomprehensible to us.It seems that alien movies more than any other suffer from an acute case of deus ex machina. This is a little different in that the movie begins with one. Yet, for some reason these aliens seem to lack any judgment as they rush headlong one after another into Craig's sniper accurate shots while they themselves never seem capable of hitting a thing. Cliché anyone? The movie tries real hard to inject back story into the main characters but fails rather miserably in being convincing and neither does it seem relevant in what is ultimately a shoot 'em up adventure.So if you want to watch a movie with some action and appealing visual effects this is it. If you recoil at old clichés then I suggest watching something else.2.5 out of 4",Cowboys & Aliens

220,featheredsun,The Clichés from Outer Space,4,5 January 2012,"I'm giving this movie a 5 since I feel generous and sorry for Daniel Craig. The script and direction for this piece of crap was so bad, that even normally-powerful actors like Daniel Craig and Sam Rockwell couldn't make it anything but B-grade sci-fi. Every scene telegraphs the scenes ahead of it. We know pretty much exactly what is about to happen because the laws of cliché demand it. Here's a list of the sins of trite scripting that are present:Every fight is broken up by another fight. - The bad guys arrive right at the specific plot points they are called to. - The offspring of the rich always act like complete idiot assholes. - Nerd becomes hero with amazing aim after a few lessons with a rifle. - Gunmen covering hostages never actually shoot them even when there's nothing to stop them. - The hero has internal GPS, able to re-join the group even after a side/plot quest. - Wall climbing aliens apparently teleport where they're needed when the plot calls for it, but can be easily tracked by humans RIDING HORSES WHILE TRACKING. - Restraints give way at the darnedest times. - All Native Americans speak the same language and they can even retroactively switch tribes when battle demands it. - Aliens don't scout during the day, except for that one time when they did. - Dogs are invulnerable and also can teleport. - Groups of 40+ need next to no supplies. - Native Americans really just need a strong grizzled white man in their lives to give them direction and save their lives, unless they need to die to heal that man's old redeemable heart. - When people die, they just relax and look off into the distance. - When the armored alien can't get at the tactically-meaningless kid, it's time for it to -of course- expose it's most obviously vulnerable anatomy to said kid, just so a meaningful prop can be used at the right time. - All battles pause for a moment when emotional scenes demand it. - A kiss can do anything. - Every hostile spaceship must have a conveniently located tunnel/exhaust port/whatever that leads DIRECTLY to the unguarded main reactor. - Heroes can turn alien technology into anything they need it to be. Gun? No, it's now a bomb...cause I said so! - Aliens with weaponry that can explode rock will always charge unarmed into obvious choke-points.And then, on top of all this, there's the God thing. At various points of the movie, we're not so subtly reminded that heaven awaits the fallen in battle. This is actually very blatant, especially at the end. Don't get me wrong, I don't mind seeing portrayals of faith, and one of the better characters in the movie is actually a pretty neat gunslinger priest, but the film-makers apparently didn't want to just portray things, they want to make it a point.This movie only barely keeps your attention and abuses it at every turn.

222,IllusionOfLife,I Was Hoping For Much More,7,29 July 2011,"Ugh, this is one of those reviews I hate writing; critiquing something that's neither very good, nor particularly bad is hard, and that's where Cowboys & Aliens stands. The film starts off well enough, there's some really great build up to both the mystery and to the central conflict; the opening scenes are everything I was hoping from this film. There are some great performances by Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, and several other actors, and the classic Western vibe with a strange sci-fi twist works really well here. However, after the first act things start to slowly lose momentum. The narrative is fairly straight forward, and doesn't really have too many interesting twists and turns, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. On the same token, none of the characters really connected with me and the film never gave me a reason to care about them or their motivations. Again, neither of these things are particularly fatal in their own right, I've seen plenty of enjoyable movies that have either a simple narrative or characters who aren't properly fleshed out, but the problem here is that you have both issues simultaneously. It's hard to get caught up in the story because it's mostly straight forward and predictable, and it's hard to get emotionally invested in the characters because the film never gives them the time to connect with each other, much less the audience. As a result things just happen on screen for about two hours, and none of it is necessarily bad in any way, in fact it's sometimes quite entertaining, but as a viewer I was never given any reason to care about any of it and so it just ended up feeling hollow. And that's about all I really have to say. I know this is shorter than my first weekend reviews typically are, but I really don't have a lot to say about this movie, because I really don't feel like it gave me a lot. With the exception of the First Act nothing made me intrigued or emotionally invested or even particularly excited. I had high hopes for this movie, between a great cast, a great director, and an interesting and unique concept I thought this was sure to be one of the surefire home runs of the summer, but instead it's just severely underwhelming. Not bad, but not particularly good either, go see Captain America or Harry Potter instead (or Winnie the Pooh, if you can find a theater that's still playing it, I can't get over how clueless Disney was with the release date on that one, but I digress).

First, Craig's character escapes 3 people who have rifles pointed at him from a fairly safe distance...then he escapes the townsfolk who have, get this, a $1 Million Dollar bounty on his head (a RIDICULOUS dollar amount for the late 1800's), then he escapes a she-woman-alien who's following him, then he escapes some aliens who chase him, then he escapes what seems to be 500 Indians (the actors were Mexicans in Indian gear), then he escapes some aliens again...then I turned the movie off!

That hat would have had to of been welded onto his head for it to stay on there! Then he lands in a river and the hat is finally off his head...I guess that G4-like wind wasn't enough to knock the hat off, nor was the massive explosion he was just involved in, but hitting the water sure did the trick!

I thought it would be a boring movie. Just before watching this movie, I might have watched Indiana Jones played on a Television channel, and yes my mind was properly set to accept a Cowboy movie.When I entered the theater, and as movie started playing, the first scene was that of Jake lying on ground, fainted, with a strange gadget on his hand. Then he wakes up and fights with a bunch of cowboys on prowl. The music played, Jake's Theme, really grabbed my ear buds. It was really cool. Jake goes to this town, and there he's captured by the local police. Aliens attack, and take away people. Jake and few more cowboys go out to rescue the people taken away by aliens. This pretty much sums up the story, if you are still reading it.What really amused me was how well the movie amalgamated a Sci-Fi related theme(Aliens) with Wild West, and it was done quite well. The aliens never looked out of place or unnatural, nor did film look any more modern because of all the alien weaponry, it still retained its rusty wild west look and feel. It was as if Clint Eastwood met E.T., not so epic, but pretty damn good. As you might be aware, this film had lot of hype going about before its release, and it has lot of fans and good will. Expectations were other-worldly, and maybe it didn't reach up to the expectations of some people.

I thought the way the characters moved and went on during the film was a bit rapid for the running time. Despite that I thought most of the characters were a bit wooden. Harrison Ford looks too old for the part and a bit cocky as a powerful cattleman. Daniel Craig and Olivia Wilde are in fact the only people who are not that cocky characters.

But, surprisingly, I enjoyed it all the way to the end. Of course, it's all very silly and predictable, but such comments would apply to a whole lot of movies out there. I'm actually more amazed by the critics here about the film. I don't know how such a movie deserve a 400 words or so critique, especially if the conclusion was 0 star. I'm told the writers couldn't come up with a good story, or that the actors were so and so Well, it's not Casablanca for sure, or Gone With The Wind. It's just a movie, entertaining, leave your mind in the lobby style and laugh in the wrong places if you must. Bring in the Aliens, the cowboys and the Indians, six shooters, arrows, lances, ray guns and what not. In my opinion all the superheros movies out there are just as predictable and silly. And for once, for all it's worth, I even enjoyed Daniel Craig this time around.",Cowboys & Aliens
228,motorfocus82,Irritating,5,27 July 2012,"This movie irritated me, for exactly one reason: This film had no sense of humor about itself.You can't name a movie 'Cowboys & Aliens' and not have some fun with the thing, but that's what Favreau does. I don't know why. Just a fraction of the chuckles I got out of the second Iron Man would have made this ten times better, just one character who throws out something funny on a semi-regular basis. But no, we get very minor league religious and family sentiments, and a love interest with an alien, wrapped in a plot with some extra-large holes. Come on, Jon. One really funny death scene might have excused so much...The graphics were good and the actors played their parts well enough, and I actually thought the cinematography was great, especially at the beginning. For a minute there, it was an arresting film. But... crap. Such a waste of a potentially fun premise.",Cowboys & Aliens
229,richard-72616,Still good today,7,19 May 2020,"I remember this film being absolutely panned, so I dodged it. When I did watch it a few years ago, i thought it was alright. Watched it again the other night and was surprised quite how good it was. A stellar cast, well written, directed and produced. I don't understand why it hasn't gone on to become a bit of a cult film. I would like to add that Daniel Craig's hat really annoyed me. Why would a Clint Eastwood style character where such an over-sized floppy rimmed hat, it made him look a bit goofy! If you liked the 'original' star wars, then you will like Harrison Ford, he plays the dark Hans Solo character, until George Lucas re-edited it and softened him into that fun loving guy.",Cowboys & Aliens
230,johnsim,Much better than I thought it would be.,10,11 June 2012,"This came and went from the cinema without much fanfare, and I've only seen the Director's Extended cut on Blu-Ray. But I can only imagine that those extra 15 minutes made a huge difference.Firstly, it's a Western. Rough characters in a dusty town. Then there's the aliens, who terrorise the towns people. It's a recipe that doesn't necessarily sound that it would work, but the direction of Jon Favreau with a story by Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman works to grasp the audience.Characters are portrayed by all the actors with a touch of realism that's rare, and perhaps because of the extra time the director's cut allows each character is made believable.Action scenes, and it's certainly not short of them, are fast paced but again the direction of Jon Favreau is excellent. Rather than the current trend of fast cuts where little is seen, the action is visible to the viewer and as such better for it too.Overall, an action film which has a strong plot with character development. That in the end you do care for the characters. These days of action after fight after crash scene with little time for interaction between character to build on plot, this film is a refreshing treat.",Cowboys & Aliens

232,SciFiSheriff,Worth it's weight in gold!,10,11 April 2012,"It has been over 42 years since a ""good"" Weird west movie came out. Now, Paramount Picture attempts to revive the genre again. Did It work? This is my review on Cowboys and Aliens.The plot goes like this; A man wakes up in a desert without any knowledge of of history or his identity. He also notices a metal armband around his arm which looks like something WAY beyond it's time. He eventually finds a small town in Arizona entitled ""Absolution"". After causing chaos with the local Sheriff, he runs into a dirty, good-for-nothing Cattle owner named Colonel Dolarhyde who seems to own the town. But before Dolarhyde could get ahold of him, mysterious attackers from the skies assault the town, abducting anyone who stands in their way. After the attack, Dolarhyde decides to cut a deal with the man with no name, due to the fact that his armband is some sort of alien weaponry. A Posse is established and they set out to find the invaders and reclaim their family members.With a few exceptions like ""True Grit"" and ""3:10 to Yuma"", Westerns that have come out in the 21st century have been far from Brilliant status of the older movies. Cowboys and Aliens seem to mix the two together; Assembling a classic western storyline with a modern alien twist- and it works! The story has all the stereotypical western characters that appeared in the oldies. You've got an old drunk, the young kid that needs to learn manners, a greedy land owner and of course, a man with no name. The writers did a really good job establishing some great western clichés that seemed to be used a lot in the old movies. The characters are extremely well acted- And why wouldn't they be. It stars great acting legends like Harrison ford and Daniel Crag. Harrison plays brilliantly, grunting and growling like some savage beast which the character seems to be. Daniel is quite good to,though there is nothing out of the ordinary to talk about. Good acting in general, but don't be going in thinking that there is going to be the best acting ever- because it isn't.One factor a look at most in Sci-Fi movies is the Aliens. The aliens in this movie are amongst the greatest of modern aliens. Im probably alone in this, but they make me feel like I'm watching an old-school alien ultimatum which is very hard for modern filmmakers to achieve. One thing I like about them is their weaponry. You see a alien armband on the Daniel Crag's character for most of the movie, but as you get to the end they reveal a lot more. They have huge, under-arm Lazar cannons that explode large sections of the landscape which is quite entertaining to watch.The aliens' motivation is nothing special but it wasn't TERRIBLE. For the appearance and weaponry, I think they deserve credit.There is a lot of action scenes to keep the action junkies happy. As well as the explosions mentioned before, we has huge spaceships blasting people, Indians stabbing aliens, Cowboys shooting aliens etc. There is A lot of battles which are extremely entertaining.Im not saying this movie is for everyone and most people will disagree with everything i have just said, but I, on the other hand, can't praise it enough. It brought me back to the old school B movies. I highly recommend the film to fans of Sci-fi action and old B westerns.I give it a 10/10",Cowboys & Aliens
233,jacco59,Sad missed opportunity,5,16 September 2011,"This could've been so much better. A mix of a great western and a great sci-fi with those two men cast in it? Sign me up! At least that's what I thought. But at 20 minutes in I was already thinking 'When's the ending gonna come?'Don't blame the actors though. They're given almost zero space to show their acting talents, especially Harrison Ford, who only talks like ten times. And then there's the ridiculous plot, which isn't really a plot at all, more like a mash-up of Alien and The Good, The Bad And The Ugly. Not that those aren't good films, they just don't fit together. Conclusion: Don't waste your time and money on this film. Watch Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes instead, that's the best movie of the summer.",Cowboys & Aliens

235,tina-175,A whole lot of aliens and a whole lot of cowboys and Indians,9,19 September 2011,"5 out of 10 because I really enjoyed it... and you will too if you turn off your brain for a couple of hours. If you really think about it, it does miss the mark... It could have been SO great but there was really no plot... or rather the plot that was, was so simple it ended up being silly!! Good actors, who embody their characters really well, wonderful CGI effects and rather unique and cool looking aliens with sharp teeth and bad intentions... if only there was a good story there.I waited so long for this film to come out in cinemas, I was giddy with excitement but the film falls short of the mark. When I walked out of the movie I was all ""yeah, nice!!"" but after I read a few reviews and thought is over and memory of the cool effects is fading, I find myself disappointed at the lack of a plot. It's like the writers/producers said ""Yeah! Cowboys AND ALIENS!! This will be cool! Let's do that..."" and then set off to shoot some cowboys and aliens together... with no real purpose.Why are the aliens attacking humans in a remote desert area? Because there is gold underground... and aliens want the gold. For what, they don't say. It would have been cool if they wanted it let's say because their planet's survival depended on it or they ate it or something. But it doesn't specify... they just want gold. And the aliens we do see in the movie, are just one ship, one scouting party. They are taking humans and torture them and kill them (with ease I might add) to ""find your weaknesses""... uhm, they are 7 feet tall, with pinchers and sharp teeth.. surely they have understood by now that one blow and a human dies... why keep taking more? And apparently we never saw them again because at the end their ship gets blown up so that sends a signal to the other aliens that the gold on Earth is not worth their trouble.Olivia Wilde, is an alien too... she took the human form to walk among us... her people were killed off by the aliens. How did she come to Earth? What does she look like as an alien? Where is her ship? Was she the sole survivor of her race? These are just a tiny fraction of all the unanswered questions and plot holes in the film. Seriously, don't they know by now, we, the audience, hate it when things are left in the air or when the explanation is ludicrous at best?? If only the story was better it would have been a wonderful, fantastic movie. Heck it had everything else going for it!!! Maybe if I was 15, ""trivial"" things like a good plot and character development wouldn't have mattered because... COWBOYS!! And ALIENS!! IN ONE FILM!! But, I am 33 and things that go ""boom"" fail to fascinate me these days...Still, not a waste of your time or money... if you can turn your brain off for a couple of hours, you will enjoy it, it is well made, with killer CGI and a whole lot of scary looking and unfriendly aliens... not too bad at all.",Cowboys & Aliens

This isn't a spoiler, so I won't go into details. A simple one is size of scout ship vs. size of alien. The way the story weaves in all the players of the wild west, Cowboys, Indians and Outlaws is very well done. The performances are pretty good, but Craig plays it too much like James Bond for me. Maybe Favreau wanted him to play it quiet-cool, it just comes off as too 'Bond-ish' for me. Ford is terrific as the tough-as-nails ex. Civil War Colonel. The effects are first rate. I enjoyed it, but they could have done a little better.",Cowboys & Aliens
239,rcnaylor,The problem is it messes with the idea of literary fiction,5,31 July 2011,"First, the movie was made by directors and actors that had the knowledge, skill and money to make a good movie. As an aside, I watched a movie on Mohammed Ali a few years ago that had a great life to make a movie about, and turned it into a boring 2 hours because they didn't know how to make a good movie.The guys making this movie know how to push audience buttons to make a good movie. The problem, it seems to me, is that this movie undermines the premise all readers, movie-goers, all those who choose to spend any time letting their minds enter a story, give the story teller: accepting the premise of the story or movie won't be abused. There will be enough sense or cohesion to make the investment in the literary fiction worth it.Spoiler alert This movie, to try to mix the genres, has to abuse the literary fiction to a degree that has the audience questioning the value of listening to stories. First, the only way an 1870's human can have a chance against technology advanced enough to get here from space is for an alien to leave its technology lying around in arm's length of a human.Then, to get the audience satisfying ending the film maker/story teller wants, the female heroine starts behaving more like a fairytale god mother than either a cowboy or alien. She comes back from the dead, got here by some kind of teleportation yet needs to walk around like us and needs the alien technology to be able to fight/destroy the aliens.This is a well made movie... except that it abuses the trust we place in good movie makers to not require the audience to ignore all reason and logic. In almost all literature we give the story teller a fiction or two.This one asks us to not just buy in to a literary fiction, but to really be mindless and or stupid movie goers.It would be like getting to the end of The Godfather and have someone sprout wings and fly off to get the plot where the movie maker wants it to go.This movie is neither fish nor foul and simply asks the audience to be dumb so two genres that don't fit together can be toyed with by the movie makers. It would have been just as satisfying to have Daffy Duck pop in at the end to save the day. There are reasons for genres. A large one is so the audience can trust where and how the story is going. Anything less than following certain ""rules"" and we are just watching random dots bouncing around on the screen without rhyme or reason. What mish/mash can I put together to keep you watching for 2 hours, say these film makers.Liked the acting. Loved a lot of the cinematography. Hated the way they ignored audience mindset, reasoning and story teller trust.I had just as soon have had Bugs Bunny convey the clichéd message of the movie: we all hang together or hang separately. At least anything he did I would have known was being done in the boundless arena of a cartoon character.",Cowboys & Aliens

The mixed genre was neither in Craig or Ford's comfort zones.Production values and special effects were average and I swear some of the fight scenes were filmed from the wrong angle showing the actors anticipating the blow.Perhaps I am being over critical but it was hard to suspend the necessary amount of belief and enjoy the movie. It was an uneasy balance of Horse Opera and Sci-Fi movie and my best advice would be for all you undecided fans is that you should avoid the movie and cherish the memory of Ford's Indie performances!",Cowboys & Aliens

Aliens & laser beams & hoover crafts is pretty much appealing but when you sit down and watch the movie you cant help it feeling that there is something missing! the glitch that makes a movie ""big hit"" or ""big block buster"" is just not there... first of all the movie has not dialog (ghee the script must have been really short for this one) nothing that anyone could remember anyway, also the movie comes just to knock one the same door that others used in there films; i mean Aliens abducting humans to experiment on there bodies... give me a break will you ? and the aliens there is nothing interesting nor original about them in the first place and i could not hep it feeling that Danial Craig whom i love by the way did not match Olivia not that i don't like her and all but she did not fit nicely in the role... also the movie started pretty well but did not manage to finish it as well as it started; meaning the big finally was not so big as we expected i think this movie could have been much better if it had some humor on Wild wild west style or more ""mysterious"" factors and as i always say: one kiss in the movie only!!! come one ....Muhannad Kaaji",Cowboys & Aliens
243,kino1969,Not as Horrible as Some Spielberg-Credited Movies Recently,6,4 March 2012,"Hesitantly, I decided to watch this movie. I had just seen the AWFUL ""Crystal Skull"" movie (which I have reviewed), and I wasn't expecting this movie to be much better. The movie is really not all that bad, but it isn't the overwhelming garbage that ""Skull"" was, either.Probably like most other postings (I am assuming, given the breakdown of reviews - I NEVER pre-read reviews before my own reviewing on IMDb), the movie has little that is original, and there are plenty of holes that are troubling. However, I was wanting and willing to simply be entertained, and I (and my family) were at that. Favreau, director of ""Iron Man,"" still kept true to his directing form, with action and pacing that held my attention (more or less). What is faulty is the story, which seems to be missing about 45 minutes. I believe the main problem with the film is that some producer (why does Spielberg's name pop-up) said, ""Favreau, keep it at 120 minutes! No one will watch a 3-hour movie!"" (I will add the line: ""I don't want someone doing a better version than my 'War of the Worlds' 'masterpiece'!"" -sarcasm, you know) Oh, the agony, and with names like Craig (always wonderful) and Harrison (equally so), this movie should NEVER have had the restrictions placed upon it like it had. I firmly believe that the problem with the movie stems from its producers, not the filmmakers per se.That said, the movie has Harrison doing a great Eastwood from ""Unforgiven"" impersonation (voice and face), Craig doing a sort of ""Magnificent Seven"" role ala Bond, and (even though I'm not into multiculturalism) some more realistic portrayals of Indians than the stereotypes of cinematic lore. However, the plot merely replaces Indians with aliens and ""cowboys"" with ""Americans"" and falls back to twisting stereotypes around. Politics aside, why would aliens want something as ""rubbery"" as gold? Where did all the aliens go who were fighting? Why were the aliens, who couldn't see well in the dark, so darned great at slaughtering? How do you get a giant into a flying Mini Cooper?Again, it is an entertaining film, if you just let it play. It's has faults (to be sure!), but I believe that some hands were ""tied"" so that the movie that one sees is not the intended one, but one that was produced for public consumption. I was disappointed to see talent wasted, but with Hollywood and finances the way they are nowadays, it's no wonder.6 of 10. Just for entertainment value. If it weren't entertaining, it'd be an easy 2 stars ------ E.",Cowboys & Aliens

245,caroeb,Weirdly disappointing,3,11 January 2012,"I was reluctant to perform the not pleasurable act of writing about this movie, but I realized that I needed to get it off my chest! Yes, you should see it for its weirdness value. But you'll feel frustrated.It's like two movies in one. The first half is bewildering and boring. The only actor who seems to enjoy his character, right off, is Harrison Ford as a bossy, grumpy geezer. Daniel Craig plays his usual wooden soldier (throughout). Olivia Wilde seems present in body (yes, nice) but absent in spirit. The others seem to have ""roles,"" but not ""characters. There is a scene in the middle in which a posse beds down for the night, during which I nearly gave up.One thing that is still a mystery to me is why these old-west humans were consistently made to appear less fazed than I was by unimaginable events and explanations. But the action picks up in ""part 2,"" during which ""events"" are explained, in a unimaginative, narrative fashion. Actors settle in to their characters. Olivia begins to shine.More could have been made of the contrast between alien technology and the clubs, bows/arrows, and revolvers of the Old West. These particular humans don't use their brains! The culmination of this movie's events is both satisfying and disappointing.",Cowboys & Aliens
246,neji107,"At its core is a silly premise, but the presentation is phenomenal",7,29 July 2011,"The Verdict --------------- As summer 2011 comes to a close Cowboys & Aliens stands alone as the last blockbuster of the season. If you were somehow unable to glean from its title, C&A strives to blend the best elements of both the Western and Sci-fi genres while trying to maintain a serious tone through it all. Expect as much surprise in the plot department as when you saw the ""& Aliens"" next to ""Cowboys"" in the title of the movie; the plot is sadly dull and predictable and limps along with the fast-paced action hoping to throw out some redeeming twists and turns, but nothing heals a fractured story once it's out there. Nonetheless, I can't say I didn't enjoy the movie! It was an entertaining and ridiculously action-packed ride that successfully relied on the meeting point between Sci-fi and Western to keep things interesting. C&A is the most thrilling movie of the summer, and a worthy blockbuster to close out the season, but there's nothing in the script that will change your life.The Rationale ----------------- Aliens' first layover on their way to conquer the world is the American wild west, so they abduct the loved ones of everyone in sight, and in turn the lovers of the loved ones unite to track down the extraterrestrials and get them back. That's the entire story in one sentence. Was it a spoiler? No, but that does give you an idea of how one-dimensional the premise is. Cowboys & Aliens takes its name and core idea from an earlier graphic novel made in 2006. Director Jon Favreau argues all other content is original. The film does not claim to have made the ultimate cross-category combination but instead revels in the fact there are both aliens and cowboys, two all-time Hollywood staples, on the screen at the same time. So is C&A simply original, or originally simple? I'll have to take the latter route. C&A mushes together the old west and invaders from outer space, but does nothing spectacular beyond that. The only plot twist in the film is completely expected and is merely a spark from a dying fire. While flaws in the plot are a shame, the blend of the two genres is amazingly seamless. Favreau was absolutely right when he said western and sci-fi just nicely fit together when both are taken seriously. I thought the only possible way I would enjoy this film would require a massive suspension of disbelief on my part, but to my great delight the movie was mostly very fluid. Unfortunately I can't shake the comparison to this summer's earlier film Super 8, also a genre-bending movie of sorts. I can't deny that the sci-fi aspect of the film looked and behaved exactly as it would under JJ Abram's command; even the aliens look like the ungodly offspring of a beetle, crab, and the Super 8 monster. This is why I came to the conclusion that the Western half C&A was crafted much more solidly and carries the weight of the film. Now if anyone can make an on screen battle of revolvers and laser- blasters happen, it's Olivia Wilde, Daniel Craig, and Harrison Ford as a team under Favreau's watchful eye. As a whole the acting is fine and the directing impressive – the blemishes come from elsewhere. Daniel Craig's character wakes up at the start of the film and suffers from amnesia, an interesting propellant right into the heart of the action and a way to keep things interesting. But his intermittent flashbacks develop his character so blandly that by the time he's ready to remember his identity, no one really cares. Everyone knows Ford is no stranger to the cowboy hat either, so here the script is to blame. Ford's character is supposed to have an inner struggle with who he is and how he acts from scene-to-scene but rather, he flops back and forth so bluntly from sympathetic-but-aloof, noble warrior to cold-blooded killer that he appears to have a drastic case of bipolar disorder instead of a complex character. Everyone else, be it the adopted Indian tracker or the gang of trainrobbers or the gunslingin' preacher man, fall into their respective, heavily stereotypical Western roles. In some cases that would make a film mundane, however I think it adds some good strength to the Western part of C&A. Where Cowboys & Aliens really shines is the action, and if you're intent on seeing it for any other reason then you are misled my friend. In keeping with his tradition of minimal CGI, Favreau crafts some of the most incredible explosive sequences of the summer. Where it is used, the CGI looks more than great and special effects will wow and amaze. C&A has arguably the best action of any movie this summer and, simply for that, warrants a trip to the theater.",Cowboys & Aliens

248,SomeUselessGeek,I wanted so much to really like this flick,7,24 August 2011,"Jon Favreau is such a great director. He's got a really delicate touch at getting the action/comedy balance just right. He proved that with the Iron Man things. And his comedy/action stuff seems to be pretty good, too -- take a look at Zathura. With a track record like that I expected Cowboys and Aliens to be a real smash.Uh, oh. How the mighty have fallen.It's not that the film is bad; it's well made, well acted, directed, produced, post-produced, everything. It's just that this time Favreau got the balance way off. C&A takes itself just a little too seriously while not presenting a very good Bad Guy in the form of the aliens.Okay, there are plenty of technical suspension-of-disbelief ""issues"" that one might point to, such as the wrist weapon that the alien technician leaves lying within reach of a subject, or that the weapon happens to perfectly fit a human wrist, or that it reacts to and even targets craft belonging to the people who made it in the first place...it goes on forever. The technical stuff can be ignored if you are having enough fun.But my real problem with this flick is that the Bad Guys are simply too easy to deal with. The cowboys, with their 1880's weapons, were able to take on and defeat the aliens, who had spacecraft capable of interstellar flight and energy weapons that used holographic targeting systems. The aliens couldn't even detect the cowboys on the ground when they flew right over them. Oy.Had Favreau managed to throw in some funny fight sequences or other conspicuous humor he might have saved this thing.

Being a major fan of Iron Man 1 & 2, I thought this project could do no wrong, especially with Steven Spielberg as producer. And thank god, I was right.Cowboys & Aliens embraces both sci-fi and western, Favreau truly found the perfect balance between those two genres. The cinematography, actually, pretty much everything visual about the film, was absolutely terrific, pure eye candy. It also knows when to be silly and when to be serious, which is a good thing. One of my biggest fears was the thought of the movie drowning in cheesiness and embarrassing lines, but there was only a few of them, luckily. Like I said, the balance between silliness and seriousness is phenomenal, just like Iron Man.While it's fun to think of it as ""007 meets Indiana Jones"" I must admit, Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford were really good as Jake Lonergan and Woodrow Dolarhyde, respectively. Not for a moment were I reminded of some of their previous great roles, but only the two roles they were playing in this movie.Cowboys & Aliens was something of a risk, and while I expected a little more action, Jon Favreau did a great job and made it into a great genre mash-up. Overall, I can't recommend this film enough if you love cowboys and aliens.

251,SelenetheHunter,good but a few too many questions.,8,14 October 2011,"Alright I'll admit it, the only reason I actually bothered to watch this movie in the first place is because of Olivia Wilde, who I might say is the hottest and just plain sensual woman around. But I'm personally disappointed in her character. I was initially intrigued that her character was allowed to have a gun, and was rooting for it but I don't believe I saw her draw the gun more than 2 times if that. Which is kind of odd considering just how much of this movie was action scenes with plenty of opportunities.I'm interested by the fact that Ella was from another world, but I still want to know where she came from and how did she know that Earth was that next target for the big bad aliens, and how did she get there if her world was destroyed? I found the scene where she came back from the dead rather beautiful, the digital work of her body in the flames was amazing to watch. Which brings me to my main point, if she could come back from the dead when her body died and was burning in the flames what was to stop her from coming back to life after the big explosion? Bottom line I had a couple of questions left unanswered, but I really did enjoy this movie and for several different reasons. Love sci-fyi films and country films, and I was intrigued as to how they planned to work with two very different subjects. Anyways this was an awesome movie.",Cowboys & Aliens
252,gregorybquinn,Satisfactory - not as bad as I thought.,6,14 March 2020,"Let's get this one out - Daniel Craig is a good actor who's totally miscast in this role of a hard cowboy - it needed a young Clint Eastwood type. Harrison ford is fine in an undemanding role. Sam Rockwell is totally wasted in his role. The screenplay is perfectly OK, the rest of cast in general is good. Jon Favreau's direction is very competent. The problem is the story hasn't had enough work done on it before shooting. I didn't hate the film, I wanted to like it. In the end I think Favreau directed the movie midway between a traditional western and an Iron Man movie - it totally misses screen texture. Should have been way better than it was. The movie's title was also a misfire.",Cowboys & Aliens
253,markzipperboy2,Unexpected Brilliance,9,15 January 2016,I had heard the negative reviews despite my high hopes for a new different perspective. So with such a negative feel about it I was so enthralled with it. Blown away with this mix of genre that worked beautifully and the cast was amazing. From start to finish I loved it. It started as a genuine Wild Western movie with a very slight hint of something just not quite right. If I had seen this movie without knowing the title and synopsis like I did with From Dusk Till Dawn which had me incredulous with its amazing twist. I had no clue as to what was to follow. Daniel Craig was unbelievably perfect as the confused clueless gun slinger struggling to remember his identity. Ford was exactly the hardened war veteran you wanted that had to think on his instincts despite what he was seeing. The originality was insane. The past meets the unimaginable and the necessary meeting of 4 different groups of humans in the 1800s just to defeat the darkness is something to revel in. If you love westerns and sci fi I defy you to not enjoy this.,Cowboys & Aliens
254,Nuz_Reviews,James Bond meets Han Solo in this fun filled Western/Sci-Fi.,7,29 July 2011,"Based on the comic book of the same name, by Scott Mitchell Rosenberg, Cowboys & Aliens is an exciting adventure for sci-fi and western fans alike.The storyline for this movie was expectantly simplistic. The time and place is in the late 1800s of Arizona, and the aliens come down to try to conquer Earth.To the best of my knowledge, an alien and cowboy confrontation has never been seen before in the cinema. Surely we have seen sort of a hybrid with Star Wars, Serenity, and Star Trek. But, never actually cowboys mixed in with alien lifeforms.I can totally see the merit in why some critics were displeased by this sci-fi/western. Even with such a robust cast like that of Daniel Craig (James Bond), Harrison Ford (Indiana Jones/Han Solo), Olivia Wilde, and Sam Rockwell, the plot is left open with too many holes. Plot holes occasionally work in films, but this one was just blatantly annoying. You'll know exactly what I mean if you see this movie. And if you're able to ignore those open-ended questions, the movie is surprisingly enjoyable.Yet another midnight feature for me this summer and the audience is yet again the same! We hear a lot of laughter at the dialogue and Harrison Ford received a tremendous applause upon his character's first appearance. I was in complete agreement with the consensus of the audience.Harrison Ford reminded me of Han Solo so much. I loved it. I'm a much bigger Star Wars fan than Indiana Jones, so in turn didn't see much of Jones; but I know he was in there somewhere. And, obviously Daniel Craig was your James Bond figure with a Western-twist. Both actors did a splendid job. Olivia Wilde was a delight too. The iconicity of both Ford and Craig was uncanny.The director was Jon Favreau (Iron Man 1 & 2, actor in Swingers), and I thought he did a valiant job once again. I enjoyed how he approached the physicality of battle between the aliens, American Indians, and cowboys. With the thought of never seeing it done before, it was all very plausible. We usually see confrontation displayed beside abundant amounts of CGI-generated special effects, and for the characters in Cowboys & Aliens, it was not the case.I was also highly pleased before this movie that it would not be shown in 3-D. Favreau was very specific about how Western films are not meant for 3-D. So awesome! ""That would be like filming in black and white and colorizing it"" ~Jon Favreau.I will say that I was hoping for more aliens in this flick. It's about 70% Western and 30% Sci-Fi.7/10 Stars. (It's 8 Stars if ya completely ignore the plot.)",Cowboys & Aliens

C&A has its usual set of clichés, but for the sake of fun - we sometimes start loving these clichés - be it the aliens capturing humans, cowboy racing along & jumping on to the alien craft (in this case), gold rush, the- everything-collapses scene etc.After all, it brings in a lot of big names together - Jon, Spielberg, ""Indiana"" Ford, Daniel, Ron Howard,Wilde, Lindelof (surprise surprise) etc.",Cowboys & Aliens

Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig should never mention this movie to no one. When you see scenes in this movie with aliens shooting cowboys and Indians, yes I did say Indians,with laser guns that can level a side of a mountain, then you see these same cowboys and Indians shoot back with six shooters and bow and arrows, the credits for this movie should start rolling and the movie screen slowly close shut.",Cowboys & Aliens

Now imagine one that is full of laughable plot devices yet insists on taking itself as seriously as a Marlin Brando in Apocalypse Now. That's this movie. Why did aliens put a device that could wipe them out on the wrist of an abductee they only wanted to experiment on to death? Why are they kidnapping humans and "" probing for weakness"" if they ""don't consider us a threat."" Why does the same ship shot for shot look completely different in size and often too small to fit the giant hulking aliens supposedly inside them? Why does the other alien who can resurrect her dead body from a funeral pyre not heal herself much earlier and save Craig the trouble of carrying her Dying body across the desert? And finally why are the aliens who have such advanced technology and stealth capabilities completely mindless in battle? There are no answers to any of these questions.

261,d_stack04,A Good Summer Popcorn Flick,6,30 July 2011,"Before you read this review, realize that the only Oscar noms this movie will receive is for its special effects. It was a fine summer blockbuster action movie. No, it was not True Grit or The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. But was it better than Transformers 3? You bet your a$$ it was. Daniel Craig, once again, delivers a solid performance in the role he played. It didn't unleash the potential of his talent (I'm waiting for David Fincher's version of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo"" to see that) but he perfectly fits as Jake Lonergan. Sure, the plot didn't exactly delve into why these aliens were so interested in gold, whether that be greed like human beings had for it during this era or a different explanation, but it did deliver on the action.Jon Favreau did a fine job blending in the two genres of western and sci-fi. He knew just when to pick up the pace and get the excitement going, and at the same time knew when to slow it down and develop the characters involved. Harrison Ford was...Harrison Ford. My only criticism was that Sam Rockwell was severely underused, much like he was in Favreau's Iron Man sequel. This guy's got talent and will show it off with the right role soon enough.If you're in the mood for an entertaining sci-fi actioner, this movie is a must see. If you want something with a little more substance, then go see ""Another Earth"", also a good film. 7 out of 10.",Cowboys & Aliens
262,silverdragon4,Good acting and High profile cast don't make a good film,4,8 January 2012,"OK. Just watched Cowboys and Aliens. Before I say anything else, I have seen Harrison Ford in many films. and liked most of them. The only mistake he has made was being part of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. That was until I saw this film. Big mistake. From the start I thought the writers and producers of this film must have either been real gutsy or real dumb to make a film about Aliens set in the 19th century Arizona. New concept. But that was for a reason. Nobody wanted to make such a film. May as well have a film called Aliens and Sparta! Aliens invade Ancient Greece. Sparta, Greeks and Persians join up and kick Alien butt. Just as bad an idea.There was one good to this film. The acting. Harrison Ford, Daniel Craig, Olivia Wilde...great acting. Unfortunately, you could be the best actor in the world, but you can't make a great film with a bad storyline. Will Smith = Brilliant actor..Wild Wild West = Bad Film.If you have a spare 2 hours and you love Sci-fi...like me, then you MIGHT at least enjoy the film. If not, don't bother. Definitely not worth buying.",Cowboys & Aliens
263,seans_life,Cowboys & Aliens > Fargo. Movie critics need to actually watch movies before rating them or just get better taste.,7,7 May 2014,"A movie that is underrated. I guess it didn't go over well at the box office & it's Metacritic rating is just 50/100 and users of IMDb, while a little more kind, gave it an average of 6.1 and to me there is no way this movie isn't a 7.The story made sense & acting was decent. There were moments where I was made to think about how in this world we work together or well don't work together & what it takes to get races/nations to work together & sadly it hasn't gotten to the point where we are all working together as one to make the world better for all. This movie had great action sequences & good graphical presentation. In terms of movie type it is sci-fi so people watching need to remember that it is fake. Seriously I wonder sometimes if people can handle fake anymore.The acting was decent enough. I never felt that it was bad to where it hurt the story. Acting as it was for this flick was what was required. This was not Titanic or Platoon. Now there were some emotional moments but it didn't need over the top acting to convey what they wanted to convey.Music definitely fit but was nothing memorable.As for how the movie ended/could have ended. Well I was led to believe for a moment that the ending I expected wasn't going to be & that is good & is something that makes a movie a quality movie.In comparison to other movies this is similar to Sky Captain & the World of Tomorrow in terms of how it wasn't appreciated. To me this movie was much more entertaining than movies of other subject matter that won huge awards. An example of a horrible movie that was full of lies & was so dry yet did so well was Fargo. What a piece of garbage that movie was. To me it kind of sums up how bad Hollywood & the movie industry is right now. Now while this is no Platoon or Man on Fire it was better than Fargo.",Cowboys & Aliens
264,obsessedmovies,Absolutely awesome!,9,28 July 2011,"I was lucky enough to attend the world premiere last week in San Diego, and I had such a great time. I saw it with the entire cast and crew of the movie, and had a great audience that made the experience even more worth-while. It was an absolute blast. The movie itself was excellent. It had a great cast consisting of Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Olivia Wilde, Sam Rockwell, Clancy Brown and Paul Dano. Everyone did a fantastic job. The action scenes were great as were the special effects and the cinematography. The aliens were really cool looking, and the chemistry between all the characters was great. I also thought the plot/story was fine, and very interesting. Although, the story was my biggest problem with the movie. I was really expecting some very neat twists from Daniel Craig's character, or some more backstory on the aliens, but sadly there was nothing big from either of those. There were also some clichés that people would've noticed right away that I honestly didn't mind at all. And finally, the directing, as always, was fantastic from Jon Favreau. Overall, I thought this movie was a great summer blockbuster, and I definitely recommend it. I'd say go with a group of friends. It will definitely make the experience better.8.5/10",Cowboys & Aliens

But you should be patient to see beautiful effects and battle sceneries.In the first three quarters you can only enjoy two or three sceneries but the last quarter is full of a huge battle scenery supplemented by nice visual effects.This movie didn't impress me as much as 'The Independence Day' or 'Avatar', but it deserves watching.

270,xfirerushx,Cowboys and Aliens- A Very Fun Popcorn Flick,7,17 September 2011,"Cowboys and Aliens is about, well, cowboys who fight aliens. Happy? Okay, sure, there is more to it, but do I really have to go into detail? Fine. A man named Jake wakes up and has no memory of who he is and he ends up getting himself into big trouble. Oh and when he woke up, he found a brace around his arm that reminds me of the Pip-Boy 3000 from Fallout 3 or Ben 10's omnitrix. The plot then turns, as we all expected, into an alien invasion movie. How exactly can cowboys beat aliens? This movie actually does this pretty realistically. It also has a great cast. Two of my favorite actors, Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford, star as a duo in this movie and the beautiful Olivia Wilde also stars with them. So we get James Bond, Indiana Jones (and Han Solo, musn't forget that now shall we?), AND Quorra from Tron Legacy??? Sweet! And everyone does a great job and do really great in this western setting. There are some people out there who said the aliens ruined the movie. Well, I don't think those people get this movie. It is simple, fun, and a good movie with some great performances. It tries to blend genres and it does it well. The movie is a western from the beginning and it stays that way until the end. The movie is also a science fiction movie from the beginning and stays that way until the end. Nothing wrong with trying something different.Cowboys and Aliens also has a great amount of cool action scenes. Seeing these cowboys (and cowgirl) fight for there lives against a foe with technology they can't even dream of at the time. It is all great fun.I know I have made it seem as if this movie is a pure masterpiece, but again, it is a popcorn flick. Sit down and watch it with a friend. Watch it in your spare time. It is just good fun. There are problems I haven't mentioned because they don't bother me much.

Don't even get me started on the Hangover.The aliens, well, at least their motivation is explained! That alone puts this well above many others that touch sci-fi. Western and sci-fi do not mix, Wild Wild West made that painfully clear. Cowboys and aliens is actually a pretty serious movie. These two facts did not AT ALL motivate me to see it.

273,cookiechip_07,A well directed genre mash-up,7,16 August 2011,"Cowboys & Aliens better than what the name suggests and when you replace the & with Vs you basically have the plot of the movie. Although that is a rather simple summary because included in the mix are Apaches, a faithful fear sensing dog, a young whippersnapper, a symbolic hummingbird, a magic bracelet and a beautiful young woman who actually looks like she could the product of a cowboy-alien! I praise Jon Favreau for an ambitious story, of trying to bring the western into the 21st century and trying to appeal to a mass audience of young and old. Considering all this, he hasn't actually done a bad job and the film is, in a word, good. This is because when attempting to cross genres like this it is always such a difficult task, the audience are usually not so keen and often unsure of how to react with such unfamiliar categories much like, but to a lesser degree, comedy horrors. Here, the film is balanced in that respect and made to feel quite plausible that in 1873, modern aliens in spacecrafts can battle against the bow and arrows of Indians and the pistols and whips of cowboys.All the mis-en-scene is thoroughly thought out and the aliens / spacecrafts wouldn't be out of place in one of Jon Favreau's Iron Man movies they are that nicely designed. The cast has been well chosen and the acting from just about everyone is solid.One problem I have is, the aliens are made to be not as intelligent as humans yet if this where the case, the humans in this movie would be flying around in aircrafts and modern technology not the aliens so that is a little disappointing. Another problem with this film is I believe, had it entirely been a cowboy western it probably would have been a far better film. I found the best aspects throughout were actually the 'cowboy' moments and that the opening scene was full of suspense and tension, more so then when the aliens arrived. On the other hand, it's also quite possible that had it totally been a sci-fi alien film that would have been far more appealing and interesting for many.As we have it, the western is a dying genre for mass audience attendance and so we have been given this mix up. Cowboys and Aliens are a non-alcoholic cocktail if you will, nice, refreshing but lack of punch. An enjoyable movie that I guess families will be the ones who will benefit mostly from.",Cowboys & Aliens

Long story short it is about ""Cowboys & Aliens"".This movie was directed by Jon Favreau, ""The Avengers"" and written by Roberto Orci, ""Star Trek Into Darkness"".My Review: The quality of sound is my biggest complaint. It was hard to follow the movie/plot without hearing what was going on. The visual however on our wonderful HDTV was amazing. The plot was pretty straight forward. Cowboys and their guns getting in trouble with the unknown creatures that followed our"" James Bond"" leader. I like that ""Indiana Jones"" was his partner in taking down the Aliens. To describe the aliens (which now would be the time to skip this SPOILER), look like a swamp thing's head with the body of an alien body on steroids. There is more action than anything in this movie.

There are plenty of characters to pick your favorite - except none of them is interesting enough to care about.The final battle (which could have somehow redeemed this movie) is also quite unexciting, sterile, dull, lame...you get the point.So overall if your expectations are high because of the household names and the premise you have been tricked just like me.

At first sight of the mechanized flying machines, zapping people off the earth, was met with no obvious comment, about the sheer quantum leap of the type of enemies that were presented. Daniel Craig's character was not likely to help because of his amnesia and the Harrison Ford Character gruffly headed off to head the aliens off at the pass. This despite the fact that guns had little effect on their new enemy and the only one with any fire power, wasn't really a friend. (Daniel Craig-he with the wrist beeper) All the scenes seemed massively improbable when the meeting of Aliens and Cowboys should have been shown to be one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.

I wasn't expecting much... i knew it was a comic (not that popular) and i knew it had a lot of cash and production muscle in it, not that it means its going to be good ... but the point is that i really wasn't expecting to be dazzled, maybe some Harrison/Craig action mixed with some sci-fi and sexy-ol' Olivia Wilde right? Wrong. At about 45 mins into the movie i had fallen asleep, my one friend sitting next to me noticed this and found it quite funny but, interestingly enough, the one sitting next to me on the other side didn't notice because he was asleep also. Noticing that we were quite peaceful i guess he decided to let us be for the remainder, which for the most part we both did. Im 25, I've been going to movies for a while now ,not to say that i know more than anyone else my age, or that this implies some sort of knowledge, but I've never come close to falling asleep in a theatre.

And this film can get DARK in both terms of the fights happening on screen as well as the gravity of the situation. Instead of some silly-mindless action, you get a film that will make you grow a beard sitting through its 2-hour run time (which flies by fast). And don't worry ladies, you get plenty of eye candy too. The film stars Daniel Craig (flawlessly using his American accent) as Jake Lonergan, a cowboy stranded in the middle of the Wild West with only a strangle bracelet on his wrist and no recollection of who he is or how he got there. After a series of dodging mishaps in the nearby town of Absolution, he is corned by Elle (played by Olivia Wilde) and hard-as-nails rancher Han Solo, I mean Colonel Dolarhyde (played by Harrison Ford). An alien invasion then commences and lays waste to Absolution while abducting several of its citizens. Lonergan must then join forces with Dolarhyde and the strange woman to stop the alien threat and discover who he really is.The first twenty minutes of the film play like any Westerner you've seen: Craig plays the gruff loner invoking the spirit of Eastwood, Harrison Ford plays the gruff boss-man of a bunch of thugs, and the usual Western archetypes are present throughout the cast. It's when the alien invasion begins that these archetypes are immediately thrown out the window and you find surprisingly deep characters. Lonergan is a wanted man with a brutal past but the allure of a lost love drives him to learn more about her fate. Harrison Ford is playing the best we've seen him in years (yes even better than Indiana Jones) as a former colonel who has seen the horrors of war and he uses his gruff demeanor to inspire confidence in lesser men. Both Craig and Ford bring their A game to this film as they pull of convincingly deep cowboys. The rest of the cast turns in solid performances. The gorgeous Olivia Wilde plays a mysterious woman who knows more than she's telling, but you can't resist caring about her. Sam Worthington plays a meek bar tender out to find his abducted wife and Noah Ringer plays a scared boy searching for his grandfather. And yes, these two minor side characters develop their arcs as boys become men. Everyone else does a great job in this setting as well. Okay, so now I've praised the story and the deep characters, but is the action any good?Oh. Hell. Yes. The fist fights between humans are brutal and visceral. Horseback chase scenes are made more awesome with alien ships hunting the heroes down. And the aliens? Looking damn fine. The computer generated images aren't glaringly obvious here with the aliens looking bulky, hideous, and monstrous. They are the perfect band of bad guys. And unlike other alien invasion films, you get to see humans get into vicious fights with the extraterrestrials. Limbs are blown off, Guns blow holes into alien bodies. Aliens eat humans right in front of their comrades. All of it is exceptionally well-done and reminds you that this is most definitely NOT a kids movie (PG-13 rating be damned). The best part? The fights mean something. You care what happens to Lonerman, Dolarhyde, Elle, Doc, and Emmett. When characters die, the persons close to them EMOTE. The characters who die are characters YOU grow attached to. You WANT their deaths avenged. You are made known in none-uncertain-terms that the situation is dire. And that's what elevates Cowboys & Aliens from a merely good film to a GREAT film.Unique action movies are hard to come by and big budget films with great characters are harder still to find. Cowboys & Aliens finds a way to merge the Western and Alien Invasion genres into something fun, entertaining, and meaningful. Characters don't get any deeper and action doesn't get any harder than you'll find here. A fantastic summer movie that I highly recommend everyone to check out in theaters.",Cowboys & Aliens
284,nothingbuttchicks,Great sci-fi for a guy who used to dream this up as a kid,9,5 January 2012,"When I was a kid I used to dream about this stuff, aliens attacking cowboys, taking their gold as their own, in a way I felt at home with this movie. And what better way then to get Han Solo, my childhood hero to play a character. Ford does what he does best, growling and flinching on screen as the boss, who has a dim whitted son who Paul Dano does a great job portraying. Daniel Craig plays the kick-ass cowboy that everyone wants to be, the rowdy, tough, bad-ass that doesn't take no for an answer. All in all, the movie has it all, gunfights, saloons, and half naked woman. It's a must see if your a big desperado and sci- fi fan.",Cowboys & Aliens
285,mikekelguard,Entertaining!,8,24 March 2021,I watched this movie again today for first time since it came out on DVD. I believe this was underrated and my wife and I both thought it was clearly better than just a 6/10 rating. There was some humour with some great action scenes as well as dramatic when dealing with the aliens. Dialogue was not earth shattering but still contributed to the movie.,Cowboys & Aliens
286,tommmk,So Stupid It Makes Your Brain Bleed,1,5 April 2013,"Cowboys & Aliens is perhaps the worst movie of 2011. Or perhaps only the stupidest movie of 2011. With some of the worst acting of 2011. Although it apparently was based on a comic book, this movie might well have been written by a dozen monkeys with typewriters, or more accurately, half a dozen screenwriters desperate for a dumb but potentially lucrative idea to pitch to some greedy Hollywood producers with very, very low opinions of their audience. In other words, a ""high concept"" idea perfect for low, low IQs. But what results is, of course, an insult not only to the audience but to both westerns and science fiction movies. On top of that, there is so much glorified gun violence--even the preacher (a ""whiskey preacher,"" naturally, for no cliché is left unturned) advises everyone to get a gun--that this movie could well be a two-hour commercial for the NRA. (Although sitting through the movie seems more like TEN very, very excruciating hours than its nominal two hour run time.) Well, did you ever expect Steven Spielberg, who produced this pile of horse manure, to be working for the NRA? And are we truly expected to care that human scum is marginally better than alien scum? By the end of the movie, I was rooting for the alien scum.",Cowboys & Aliens

288,howard_Patrick,Cowboys and Aliens loose the fight to over-hyped publicity,6,12 August 2011,"When it comes to blending two different film genres for a movie, it takes a lot of hard work and careful balance in order to satisfy the audience with each thrilling side. There are definitely examples out there that show two genres not dominating over each other such as Aliens, Rango, Zombieland, Blazing Saddles, and The Incredibles. Aliens succeeded in inserting a horror element with a cool Sci-Fi story that practically has you on the edge of your seat with terror. The Incredibles, well, what can I say more than a great animated movie with a great blend of superhero mayhem that you wished was a comic book. This year's cross-genre movie, Cowboys and Aliens, unfortunately, doesn't make this list for it just stuck to a very conventional and clichéd western formula and the back-story to Olivia Wilde's character that didn't get any development once it surfaced.The movie centers around wanted criminal Jake Lonergan played by Daniel Craig (Casino Royale), during the 1870's in the wild west, who wakes up in the middle of the desert one day and has no recollection of who he is and why he has this strange, alien bracelet strapped to his wrist. After confronting three cowboys that results in Lonergan introducing them to their maker, he rides into a nearby town and is very quickly recognized by the town sheriff and two henchmen that work for cattle boss Woodrow Dolarhyde played by Harrison Ford (Indiana Jones Quadrilogy). Dolarhyde, who apparently has some beef with Lonergan, rides into town to stop the sheriff from taking Lonergan to the hangman's noose. That night during the confrontation, these peculiar and strange lights appear a few yards from the town that, once completely over the town, start attacking the town's folk, blowing up the buildings, and then start to snatch people left and right including Dolarhyde's son. Lonergan shoots an approaching ship, with his alien bracelet, that crashes and releases a wounded alien into the dark, desert plain. Discovering its tracks, Dolarhyde, Lonergan, and few others begin their chase to catch up to the creature and find out why these beings are here and what they want. In the group, a mysterious woman named Ella played by Olivia Wilde (TRON: Legacy), who may have the key to Lonergan's past and identity.After the experience of watching Iron Man and Iron Man 2, John Favreau, as a director, can really deliver in spectacle and action. I was going in thinking that Favreau's going to create a bad-ass and maybe some what of a ballsy western. I was deeply disappointed and unimpressed by Favreau's conventional and clichéd western. It had nothing to offer than what we've already seen for countless of other westerns. Craig's character is the stranger with no name and has a mysterious and dangerous past. Harrison plays the gruff and tough bully that nobody messes with because without him the town would be left in the dust. The film even brought the old' theme of what it takes to be a man between Dolarhyde and the sheriff's grandson, now I wouldn't mind that if they didn't go about the most boring way and in the end it was just pointless.I was constantly back 'n forth with the purpose of Olivia Wilde and the instant stop of her character's development. In the beginning of the film, she's set up as the key to Lonergan's unknown past for a couple a scenes and then in the middle the audience finds out that she has a connection with the aliens. I have to give credit to Favreau for giving Wilde some back-story at first, no matter how silly and sudden it was. I was being forgiving, but then all of sudden, the movie stopped with her story and made her Mrs. Exposition for the motives of the aliens throughout the rest of the movie.Now matter how much I'm ragging on this movie, I did have a fun time and there are some redeeming qualities. The chemistry between Craig and Harrison was great and they had a lot of funny moments together. I was freaking in love with the design with the aliens and the C.G.I. for them and the alien space crafts looked more convincing than they did in the trailers. Favreau's camera-work with the landscape and the action sequences made it really stylish, in a way.Is Cowboys and Aliens John Favreau's best work? No, Iron Man is. I do believe that he made a really fun cross-genre movie that has it's moments that are really bad-ass and really funny. This is perfect for a rental during date night, but if you see this at a matinée it definitely won't kill ya. I give Cowboys and Aliens a high rental or two out of four popcorn bags.",Cowboys & Aliens
289,bandoolero,An honest movie: its all 'bout cowboys an' aliens :P,10,18 April 2012,"First, please don't go watch this movie if you want to see something serious, historically correct or dramatic. This is a fun movie. It is an experiment to see what happens if you mix the two genres: western and sci-fi. And boy, that mixing is FUN! First you have Daniel Craig acting as James Bond, than Harrison Ford, who just utterly enjoys his role and plays awesomely. And they both know that this movie i not serious, so why not act like it was? :DIf you start watching this movie, just relax, enjoy the cinematography, enjoy the characters, the (intended) clichés and the AWESOME action scenes with aliens and spaceships! You will be satisfied, and entertained well for the duration of the movie :) (it also helps if you drink a lil' of whiskey beforehand)",Cowboys & Aliens

Don't watch this at all.,1,9 April 2016,"I had considered going to see this film in cinemas, but I didn't due to other more interesting movies that were out at the time, but thank God I didn't see this movie in cinemas. Once it came out on DVD, I rented it. You'd think in the first place, that there would be some reason of making a movie about such an odd combination, because in the first place, no one likes that kind of combination...cowboys and aliens?Initially, ""Cowboys and Aliens"" sounded just like Cowboys and aliens fighting each other which was exactly what this movie was and nothing more. There was no plot or story, except for the typical clichés we've seen over a thousand times: Daniel Craig's character plays a cowboy who has amnesia...what? Seriously Jon Favreau? I love Jon Favreau as an actor and a director, but this movie was seriously a f***ing waste and a complete pile of horsesh**. Maybe I was being naive to think that, well there has to be some reason to put these two together, otherwise no one would be interested, so maybe these people (the film crew) have something to say about this movie. Maybe it will be a good movie. I was still thinking, why would someone want to make a film about cowboys and aliens together? The aliens just attack the humans, and invade the Earth basically, but for what? It's nearly disaster porn. Words can't describe how much I hate this movie eternally. I wish I hadn't wasted my money on this. Jon Favreau thinks this is a good movie? There was no story.

Harrison ford is also very cool in it and i enjoyed his performance. the other actors in it didn't really stand out to me in this film although some were good. the film itself is OK but not brilliant to be honest i was a bit disappointed because i love most cowboy films. this film was a bad merge i think of true grit and alien which are both very good movies. the story line didn't really grip me until the end but i still came out of the cinema thinking would i see that again i dunno i think there are better films on offer although this is one to see but not brilliant don't expect too much. i give this film a 7/10 because it does have it's good witty moments in it",Cowboys & Aliens
292,gordonhr,To clever in it's genre,9,3 December 2011,"I was pleasantly surprised with this movie, because I didn't expect anything more then waste of time before going to bed. But in the middle of it the metaphor and political comment on present world and economical situations are started to reveal it self. What I liked it more is the fact that it is done with subtlety and style which is not in your face or vulgar like the last SF film which I know about who have tried to say something more then just generic SF plot. I'm talking about movie which have aliens placed in ghetto in South Africa city, I can't remember the title. Cowboys & Aliens have also some parallel themes, along with the fight against the common enemy, which are nicely incorporated together; finding solutions for different cultures who have to live together, understanding between them and forgiveness for past crimes. I would have to watch it again to see some other aspects of it, because I wasn't prepared for even one. In past couple of years Hollywood big SF movies are just generic waste of effects and violence without any message or moral or political statement. Just for the fact that this film is trying to incorporate something more in it's genre I would give it a 9/10 stars.",Cowboys & Aliens

I went to see it anyway and I profoundly disliked it. Say what you want about Michael Bay, but his films while narratively inept have good action scenes. This film, however, is a such a drag. With a title like Cowboys and Aliens one should expect a fun and dumb action film. This film is dumb, but instead of fun, it is boring and plays itself too seriously.The actors are all mostly good, except Olivia Wilde, whose character is nothing but eye candy and a character devised to provide exposition.",Cowboys & Aliens
294,mrvnstwrt,James Bond feat. Indiana Jones,6,23 September 2011,"As all u can see from my summary title above, this film maybe THE WORST usage of 2 great star whom these 2 were formerly play as an iconic figure in movie history.. the first time we heard the name movie title, we thought "" dough"" ""huh"", etc. and then after we saw the trailer + the list of the cast in this movie we thought ""hmm this maybe will not a bad movie"". after saw this movie, i bet 60-80% of you felt disappointed. why not...? there's a good reason why Cowboy & Aliens fail to fulfill people's expectation. first of all the there are many plot-hole in the script that makes people feel confused when watching this movie. it takes a little bit too long to explain the Daniel Craig's past character. but the most important thing is: just like my summary title said.. when we heard Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford cast in this movie together (again i bet) all of us would expect that there will be a some great action by these two stars.. but then again what do we got...? a very so-so action quality. although in my view Daniel & Harrison did a very hard & try to make as exciting as possible but still the action was just like that. Daniel was the only man who worked his a*s off in this film so it makes Harrison look like a cameo rather than a supporting actor. the best ""James Bond & Indiana Jones together"" is in Harrison's iconic movie: Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade which Ford teaming up with the original 007, Sean Connery. Olivia Wilde in this movie did everything she could but then again it also went flat.The Alien also looks ridiculous that could make E.T much..much better (maybe the sexiest alien ever LOL..!!) the 1 thing (in my view) that make people want to watch this movie till it's credit title is the past of Daniel's character. but then again just like i said above it takes too long although fortunately, in the end, we understood his character's past clearly. but overall this film just so-so there's nothing special about it. so the lesson that we can take after watching this movie is don't always expect a big satisfying result in a big satisfying process..",Cowboys & Aliens

297,r_uldal,Brilliant niche movie :),8,4 December 2011,"Just watched this movie yesterday evening, and i was positively surprised.Cowboys & Aliens can best be descriped as a Independence Day type movie, set in the Wild West. It is a niche movie that test the limits of the Alien movie genre, and it works. I for one was beginning to get tired of Alien Invasion movies that all look alike. This opens up a brand new way to go with this type of movie. The only thing that really is annoying about this movie is the title and the first 15-20 minutes of the movie. With the title giving you the basic plot of the movie you find yourself watching a western and just waiting for some aliens to pop up. Also you are as a viewer dropped directly into the whole Cowboys vs Aliens thing. I think this movie could have been so much better if they had given it a ""shock"" effect, like From Dusk til Dawn. If it had had a better title that didn't give away the plot, and the first 20 minutes would have been a great and good western movie, introducing the aliens after some time would really have had people up from their seats :)Apart from that, it lived up to my every expectation, even though the plot is easily figured out by the audience so you will often find yourself just sitting and waiting for that thing to unfold on the screen. The action in the movie is just spot on, both the sci-fi action but also the old style Western action part is really great. Daniel Craig puts on a OK performance, he tries his best to talk hillbillie American, but it fails a bit from time to time. I would have chosen another actor for his part, maybe Ryan Reynolds?Harrison Ford plays his part great, he has a dark side to him that is not the usual Harrison Ford'ish role, this really works.This movie really aim at the male part of the audience, and it does not disappoint. If they where to make a spin off called Knights and Aliens, i would definitely watch this movie too :)",Cowboys & Aliens

300,mickjo,I don't understand how anyone could dislike this,8,18 June 2013,"I bought this from a bin of cheap DVDs in my local supermarket, intrigued by the title. The fact that Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford were in it also prompted me to take a risk: after all, cheap DVDs are often so for a reason.I must say, I was very pleasantly surprised. I wondered if cowboy and ""alien"" sci-fi genres would mix very well, and I think in this film they in fact do so. There's intrigue in the story right from the start, when Graig's character wakes up in the desert with a strange device clamped round his wrist, and the pace with which the story unfolds from there is just about right. There's a certain amount of hokum, but not much, and certainly not enough to distract or detract.The production values are very high and the special effects very convincing: not least because, as the special features make clear, they aren't all CGI. Some of the scenes where alien craft fly overhead and yank people on cords up into the sky were done with models going at 70 mph along high wires, and some of the actors did their own stunts, including Olivia Wilde, who is apparently an accomplished horsewoman.The test for me is whether I get absorbed and am able to suspend belief. This film did the trick for me, and I'm sure I'll be watching it again. This time, the bargain bin really did produce a bargain.

All is explained towards the end of the film, like Daniel Craig's alien wrist watch that snit his but that he stole it from the alien who was about to probe him, which comes in handy to know right at the end of the film! Overall this film is very exciting and jam-packed with action scenes. Although boring whilst the cowboy's are tracking the alien this all gets made up for when they finally find it, before this all you see is Daniel Craig hit Harrison Ford in the face and beat up some other guys, but after finding the alien a thoroughly enjoying film!!!!!

He is a bland actor, the way he looks so casual and smug after beating up a bunch of cowboy's in the first scene just proves he is not suitable to be serving anyone but MI6.

As the plot unwraps so does your frail interest, first time round pretty good but why bother watch it again when the whole movie leads to one big concluding ending? I am someone who believes tat good movies can be watched multiple times but this, all the questions are answered and i see no need to buy the film when leaving the cinema with not one in my mind.Ford's performance is somewhat of a comfort to most of the underdeveloped actors but it's nothing remarkable.If you haven't seen it, i don't say not to just don't expect a sequel or to feel like the conclusion left some questions lingering in the back of your brain.

306,Durbaq,The Opinion Hole: Cowboys and Aliens: The Film With No Soul,4,2 April 2012,"When I first heard of this film, I saw the teaser trailer. The premise was outstanding, for me my two favourite popular genres: science-fiction pulp and classic westerns would at last be joined forever in the glorifying summer blockbuster stable. To be honest, I had to ask myself 'Is this real, can it be as good as it promises?' Genre collisions are a very rare and mystifying aspect of filmmaking, take a few good examples: Alien (horror and science-fiction), Aliens (science-fiction, horror, action), Who Framed Roger Rabbit? (animation, live-action and film noir) and a more relevant example: Serenity, the Firefly feature length spin off which is questionably to best living proof of a 'Western in Space' done right.In Joss Whedon's brilliant swansong to his criminally under-rated TV series, we follow a ragtag group of thrown-togethers as they run and gun their way through the worst Mos Eisley towns this side of the Outer Rim. You watched that film and not only could you be amazed at the technology, the spaceships, the pristine, and the staple sci-fi government conspiracy parts, but the characters dressed, acted, and were as lovable as John Wayne, Clint Eastwood and Han Solo (yes, Solo a space cowboy if there ever was one.) This brings me neatly to the crutch of the review: Cowboys and Aliens, from Iron Man director John Favreau. The film stars Daniel Craig, Olivia Wilde and Harrison Ford – who still brings back memories of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.*[1] In the beginning, Jake Lonergan (Craig) has amnesia. He wakes up, who he is? We don't know. He has a strange, steam punk-esque device strapped to his wrist. Three crooks try to rob him, he quickly subdues them. And here is the first overlying problem of the film. It is never established exactly how Lonergan is able to fight them off so effortlessly, leaving us with a person who simply seems not have to worry, nor care about overcoming anything, if he is able to combat three armed drifters after being unconscious. 007 is cool and detached, this character is a Terminator. A machine. He heads to the nearest town.Moving along, Lonergan ends up in jail because he is recognised by the sheriff in Absolution as wanted outlaw. The titular aliens attack the town during the night, where many people are abducted, including Percy the son of ruthless cattleman Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde (Ford). If Lonergan is a Terminator, Dolarhyde is Yosemite Sam – gruff, cantankerous, and unlikeable. These characters are so underwhelming and lacking in unique development that it cements the film as having all the elements of TV movie with the added sheen of 'star power'. I suppose you could defend the movie, arguing 'Well, it has the conceit of a B-Movie, the premise I the same; surely you can say it's alright that the characters are flat and boring.' Consider 1996's Independence Day which, for a better word, is the 'ultimate B-Movie'. It is a self-contradicting title; surely B-Movies aren't summer blockbuster material? But then why did ID4 make nearly six times the money that Cowboys and Aliens did? Possibly because it used the cinematic format to increase the scope and scale and show audiences what an alien invasion could look like and make it exciting. It also had some likable characterisation in Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum's family lives. Something Cowboys and Aliens failed to do.After a lovely Western journey cross country, with formulaic moments of rest and character development (Like the church scene in Saving Private Ryan except on rapid-fire back-story mode), the Lonergan/Dolarhyde party arrive at their destination. The alien's base of operations is a goldmine. Yes. The aliens have travelled all this way, to mine our gold. Why? To power their machines. Okay, so you have a function, what is the reason? Why do they need to power their machines, what machines are they and why does gold power them. It's cheat, presenting a problem to overcome; it's like building a brick wall for a character to climb over. The wall is just there, it doesn't need explaining but if they don't get to the other side then, well, the climax won't be satisfying! And they have been abducting humans to carry out experiments on them, which is fair enough. Better than the gold subplot. Still reeks of bad B-Movie plotting.The film ends with Ella (Wilde) actually dying to save the kidnapped humans, after Lonergan regains his memory of his 'true love', perhaps Ella served her purpose and she had to take her rightful place at being dead. Lonergan really is a Terminator, incapable of love or commitment to women. He ends the movie, riding off into the sunset. Dolarhyde redeems himself and becomes the character I wish Ford played from the beginning.A film like Cowboys and Alien looks nice, it has many recognisable faces, the special effects are so-so and it should be defendable by the 'mindless' summer blockbuster theory. However, this film which looks amazing has, underneath, nothing. No memorable moments, any standout set pieces. It's all been done better and done before. This film has no soul. And it's really hard to say that about a movie. I will say it tried; it tried to appeal to everyone, to be post-modern and to be the next big franchise. But it failed because it was too formulaic and didn't try anything new.*** [1] Note: Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, is a terrible film, because it attempts to disprove the last three films' religious pathos as mumbo jumbo, forcing onto the audience the overruling concept of pan dimensional 'aliens' as being responsible for everything in history that has supernatural elements – which goes against everything the Indiana Jones films stood for.",Cowboys & Aliens
307,leonardoleme9,A pretty nice movie,8,1 May 2012,"After looking at this movie's ratings here on IMDb, my expectations were low but with Spielberg as a producer, I thought I should give it a try. I was really surprised at how I liked this movie. The acting is pretty great and the plot is very cool and original too. I definitely recommend this one.Although I really liked it, there were three main aspects that bothered me. The first one is the fact that the aliens were looking for gold. Gold itself is pretty useless even to humans, talk about aliens. The other two aspects are two specific scenes: the one where Jake brings gold home and the one where Pat dies. Why would the ""devils"" go after Jake and a bag of coins if they were extracting gold from the earth as if it was oil? And just before Pat is dead, there is a war going on but as soon as he dies, the war apparently stops for one minute or two while they are around him.But as the movie ends, you can look behind and tell it was a good one. Once again, I was really surprised at how good it turned out to be. It's worth watching it.",Cowboys & Aliens
308,benjameshodges,Bad Western and a Bad Sci-Fi...What's Left?,3,16 March 2012,"With a name like 'Cowboys & Aliens', it would be understandable to think that this is a comedy with action and wit. However, this began as a serious western with hints of sci-fi elements with little back story, reason or intrigue.Daniel Craig plays a cowboy with a convincing stance and accent but with no charm or reason to like him. However the script and plot is to blame as there is never a full explanation for the happenings or why the audience should care.Olivia Wilde's character was never explained and often she became a pretty (permanent make-up even when wet) but annoying tag-along that seemed to want to prove herself among the acting giants of Craig and Ford.The western side of the movie seemed like a caricature of the old west, seemingly parodying great films stars like Wayne and Eastwood with none of the charm. It also featured landscape a silhouette shots that were meant as an homage to the classics but were misplaced with the bland, uninteresting characters.The sci-fi side was introduced later in the movie with no build-up or mystery. They just turned up in plain sight. Also, plot devices such as Craig's alien blasting bracelet was never investigated and how it managed to fit his arm with him being able to use his brain to control it was just plain dumb and lazy. Harrison Ford offered the most character in the film with his steely determination and reserved but clear emotions that gave his character a reason to be there(unlike Wilde's).Cowboy's and Aliens is ultimately a bad, expensive film that succeeds in neither genre that it tries to combine. It also includes many unnecessary shots of horses being brutally killed, which seemed out of place for a movie with such a daft title.",Cowboys & Aliens
309,anthonypape,A lot more serious than the name would suggest. Decent effort,8,26 July 2013,"I put off watching this movie for some time, for the simple reason - it sounded like a slightly spoof or comedy sci-fi/western due to the name. In fact this is nothing of the sort (thankfully) and is actually a very decent shot at combining typical western fare with an alien element. From the first (quite violent)and bloody fist fight you'll realise this isn't silly kids stuff. Too often these days, a movie like this would have been dumbed down and littered with comedic or slapstick scenes. The story such as it is, is basic, but believable. The way the movie plays, at no point do you question the believability of having cowboys fighting aliens with their obviously superior technology. It was something that concerned me before watching but it works out right and makes sense. No issues with any of the acting, or the effects. Overall a decent effort, worth watching especially for sci-fi fans.",Cowboys & Aliens

It had all the elements that have made Hollywood timelessly entertaining for so many decades now - Great western ""feel"", the gripping new James Bond attitude of Daniel Craig, realistic CG, and heavy alien presence.The plot requires some suspension of disbelief but hey that's what entertainment is about. If people want ""believable"" movies they need to watch docu-dramas. If they want to get entertained and want an entertaining experience of ""what would something look like if it was real"" then this movie is it. It's highly engaging, the story doesn't drag at all, the action is bullet proof, and the concept is 'unique' if nothing else.High marks to Daniel Craig's ""as man as it can get"" character. He truly excels in such roles. Harrison Ford did a magnificent job as a gutsy western hero who just won't back down from a fight.

It does sometimes hurt apparently to see reality with some viewers who only want James Bond/Indiana Jones/John Wayne as a starting point to what reality is. But wake up the producers did a fantastic job combining all the aspects to entertainment and reality and combined it a dose of human/alien nature. See the use of taking what would be a Western and introduce a new angle sideways that not only could have but most likely has occurred. Yet the recording devices of the past couldn't hold a candle...literally to the 20th centuries digital world. So, what better to introduce it than by folklore and the telling of a tale. The director here did just that with a story told that just happened to combine the best of mankind in all of its forms.

Although the story is a little thin the performances from the whole cast are solid. Having said that for a movie with Daniel Craig, Harrison Ford, Sam Rockwell, etc., you'd expect something that is at the very least very good. Near the end I did start to feel for the characters but I just never felt really connected to them throughout the movie. It is already two hours long but maybe it would have been better if it had been a little longer so that there would have been a little more development in the characters.

From the start the movie was predictable; it just went through the motions to the point that half way through I was counting the minutes. The characters were two dimensional and boring, (seen it all before) a quarter through you see on the back ground the usual token tough gun wielding female with perfect makeup skin and hair, to satisfy the feminist lobby. It has become so tiresome in action movies there is always the token tough female, they are so out of place that it takes all credibility out of the movie and story. The story has so many holes in it, the writers don't even try to justify anything that happens. Put it this way if I had paid for this movie I would ask for my money back. Waste of time.

It starts off as a gritty Western. In fact, I was enjoying it so much that I was quite happy for it to stay as a conventional Western. But when the aliens appear, it winds up a notch into a rip-roaring adventure.
The characters have a great time fighting vicious alien monsters. There is a nice coating of subtle (and not so subtle) black humour. Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford give excellent performances as the archetypal anti-hero and tough cattle baron.

(http://www.searchindia.com/2011/07/30/cowboys-and-aliens-review- %E2%80%93-ridiculous-garbage/) Here's what he says:""The movie was clichés galore.Ø Harrison Ford gives a knife to a kid asking him to be a man and use it when needed. When the time comes, the Kid uses it to kill an Alien.Ø There is another guy whose wife is captured by Aliens. He is trained to use guns but he is a lousy shot. You know he will get it right when the time comes and he does it.Ø There is more to the mysterious Ella than what meets the eye. You know it and you get it.""""Some things were downright ridiculous:Ø The Aliens are supposed to be more advanced than Humans of 1800s but what you see is a bunch of drunken gorillas running around crazy.Ø Why does Jake get thumped in the skull all the time when a bunch of new people walk into the screen?Ø How come a hardened criminal becomes a goody two shoes after a thump in the head resulting in memory loss?Ø The bracelet on Jake's hand does not come off no matter what. Ella solves the problem in seconds by Kissing Jake and the bracelet simply falls off.Ø The Aliens come to earth to collect gold. Humans are captured merely for study.Ø The half-wit villagers chase away a few aliens with sticks and stones! Most of the action scenes were greeted with laughter in the theater where I watched the movie.""So let me get this straight: You complain when ""there is another guy whose wife is captured by Aliens. He is trained to use guns but he is a lousy shot. You know he will get it right when the time comes and he does it."" because it's cliché, but you whine when ""the half-wit villagers chase away a few aliens with sticks and stones!""

And when a good movie like this one stares at you in the face, you just have to find something wrong with it.

From the get go, questions are thrust into your lap, you're curious what happened, how it happened and why, 30 minutes later and enter the female protagonist, (Olivia Wilde) rather then her clarifying any answers, she instead just chooses to mind f**k you a little more.Not much is answered. The resolution for me just wasn't there. I left feeling like i wasted 2 hours.As usual of late, it had spectacular special effects and very well done stunts, and wasn't entirely void of emotion.Maybe i've been quite harsh, i think it's justified but perhaps not, if a bunch of ragtag cowboys chasing aliens across the desert only to shoot at them sounds good to you, then it may well float your boat.If you like Harrison ford and Indiana Jones, you may well like this.

If you throw in a couple of Indians then you have Cowboys and Aliens. A lot of people think that this movie looks stupid just because its cowboys vs aliens. But think about it, its like any other alien movie just a different time period. I didn't really have faith in this movie when i first heard about it but then i found out the movie was being directed by the guy who directed Iron Man(Jon Favrea), then i found out it was starring James Bond and Indiana Jones along with Olivia Wilde and Sam Rockwell. Who wouldn't want to see that? Its not supposed to be an Oscar winning movie, its supposed to be a fun summer blockbuster. It was one of the funnest movies I have ever seen. Its the perfect summer blockbuster. The western part of it felt a lot like True Grit and the alien part look like....well like alien movies always do. The movie is just such a blast. The acting was outstanding. Daniel Craig and Harrison Ford both brought their A game and Olivia Wilde was perfect for her role.

I have to admit that I ""jumped"" a couple of times and was on the edge of my seat once or twice. There were some funny lines too. There was a lot of action but somewhere, something happened and the movie was all done, just all done. They could have probably left a lot more on the cutting floor than they did!

331,elven_rangers,Silly and marginally entertaining,3,31 August 2011,"This movie is just as preposterous as you would expect from the title. Then again, pinning completely parallel iconic groups (or characters) one against the other in absurd environments has plagued the collective imagination for some time. Alien vs Predator, Ninjas vs Pirates, DC Comics Heroes vs the Marvel Universe, Jackie Chan vs Bruce Lee, Sailor Moon vs DBZ. Anything goes.There are a few secrets to make an outrageously silly production like this work: 1. don't take yourself seriously. The idea is silly, adding drama to it makes it even sillier. Use the silliness to your advantage, perhaps some self-irony. 2. stray from the ""source"" material. Whatever you claim as source, it is as ""original"" as pizza in an American restaurant. However good and changed, pizza is still an Italian dish. Therefore you don't need to feel bad for modifying it and giving it some touches that the author never thought of. Who knows, you could make it better.Favreau and his writers fail across the board. They hesitate to make the source material their own. I already know that Favreau can do pretty good things (see Iron Man). Here he doesn't and the result is stiffness all around. Stiff acting, stiff writing.The movie takes itself too seriously. As far as Craig's character is concerned, that would work if they would've stuck to a silent dark mysterious hero. He has the make of it: shoot them to death, don't talk them to death. That part has its charm with a bad-ass like Craig. Downside? He has no background. If Favreau would've left him with no background, that would've worked. What doesn't work is an attempt at giving him a back story that has absolutely no effect on the plot. Wife dead, memory lost (sure, an old fart like the sheriff gets his memories back 2 minutes after getting out, the Craig bad-ass needed Indian intervention two days later), a pathetic attempt at a romantic subplot.The girl (oh, alien girl). Why is she even there? A lot of jibber-jabber about her lost world then she commits suicide. I was happy when she got killed first time and so annoyed that she came back to life (also, the fact that nobody seemed very disturbed that a dead woman walks out of some random flames managed to disturb me - yeah, that happens everyday in Texas). Oh, and she's nowhere near as hot as the movie poster makes her to be.The clichés run high. In fact, there's no western movie cliché that doesn't fall in, with one exception: Indians doing the war (or even ghost or rain) dance. Nope. They smoke the hell out of Craig, visions and so on, sure. They talk funny and pretend not to know English.Oh, and Harrison Ford is there too, but I barely even noticed. Also, a bunch of useless character that die along the way. Obviously, of the two likable characters, one dies first (the wise preacher). Thankfully, the other (the dog) survives.The end.",Cowboys & Aliens

I don't know what people were expecting but the movie was called ""Cowboys and Aliens."" I saw cowboys and then aliens. Daniel Craig is really trying to make a name for himself outside of the Bond films.I really think he's going to have the best post Bond career because he's such a great actor. His accent was on point and he picks up where Cling Eastwood left off with ""the man with no name"" type of character. Harrison Ford was effective as his nemesis but he tends to be grouchy in several of his films as of late.Olivia Wilde was OK, any number of actresses could've played that part. Jon Favreau, who I loved directing the Iron Man movies is trying to do something different and I applaud him for trying. The special effects are amazing.

Daniel Craig does the distant stranger role well. As always with alien films the start is stronger than the finish, lots of suspense and uncertainty, then you see the alien are slightly disappointed that its just a moody overgrown frog.But regardless, you are taken along with the journey (the steamer scene is good and tense) and root for some characters (Sam Rockwell's downtrodden barkeep and the young lad).

I am critical when it comes to westerns, because they are the movies I was raised on... but this movie is like a cross between ""The Searchers,"" ""Aliens,"" and ""Indiana Jones."" This man knows how to tell a story and make a great film!",Cowboys & Aliens
337,jpr-14,A not so short rejoinder,8,1 November 2014,"This is a far from perfect movie and relatively recently Firefly certainly did a far more effective blend of cowboys and space opera. However, it is interesting to note that many of the folks reviewing this film here are having just as much difficulty accepting a Science Fiction Western as the critics had accepting it when they reviewed Firefly.This is the first film in years in which it felt to me like Harrison Ford was doing much more than going through the motions. His performance here is complex and carries an emotional arch that I have never seen him achieve before. I found nearly all the actor performances quite compelling, complex and engaging, although the character of Percy Dolarhyde was written as so whiny and wet that even a very creditable performance by Paul Dano really could not save it.Daniel Craig appears to me to be playing the stoic, turned in, thoughtful, but essentially violent man that has lately become his stock-in-trade. I have seen him do other parts that required him to give more as a performer, but in this movie he did all that the character required.As to the illogical ""faults"" of the aliens. As I watched the movie the first time I just assumed that the ""killer scouts"" we saw were a sub-species, perhaps a genetically engineered sub-species, of ""soldiers"" in much the same way that there are worker, nurse, and queen bees and ants that are harvesters or soldiers or scouts. It seemed obvious to me that these brutal killing machines were not the ones that designed and built the tech and merely the soldiers who kidnap ""the natives"" and turn them over the the less armored, slower, and more intelligent scientists doing the planetary survey for testing, who would eventually report the findings to the ""kings"" or ""queens"" who will decide whether the planet will live or die. (Since I wrote this I've had a chance to listen to the commentaries on the Blu-Ray and it appears that most of my inferences were correct.)A comment on Sam Rockwell. IMO no one can over-act so consistently, annoyingly, and clownishly as Sam Rockwell. For me, Iron Man II just barely survived the pure schmaltz of Sam Rockwell as Justin Hammer. BUT credit where credit is due, Mr. Rockwell's truly excellent performance as ""Doc"" in this movie gives me hope that I will never again have to endure another characterization gut-clenchingly strident and irritating as Justin Hammer.And there are many other excellent performances - Keith Carradine's being particularly notable. To me the biggest defect of the film is the speed at which the aliens move. Most of the time by the time you notice where they are, they are gone. In the commentaries Jon Favreau says this was intentional. To make the aliens more mysterious and therefore more menacing, but my aging brain cannot quite keep up with the action at that speed and I lose the sense of what is happening where, and thus how the action is being resolved.Cowboys & Aliens is unlikely to become a ""classic"" like, certainly, ""Star Wars IV"" or ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" (1951), but IMO it is a better than average production, with excellent acting, that pays respectful homage to Film's powerful ""Western"" tradition, but sadly based on a very odd concept.",Cowboys & Aliens
338,achillespsalt,a waste of time and money,3,25 December 2011,"Simply ridiculous. Olivia Wilde seems to be the only good thing in this stupid film of very bad taste.No wonder why no one made a film like that before. The final confrontation is at least laughable. I wonder why all the aliens want to land in the U.S.A. and not in any other part of the world.? Why ,in more than 80% of the films, they want to destroy our word, with no apparent reason? and finally why all of us are saved by American super heroes, who most of the time are brain-deads( the only realistic thing about these films )? In my opinion:better stay away from a film who is inspired by a caption in the front cover of a magazine",Cowboys & Aliens
339,postee,Only half a movie,3,22 November 2011,"Horrible. I fast forwarded a lot after Daniel Craig jumped onto a flying alien space craft from his horse as if it were a train scene in some other western. This is pretty much how the movie went after that point. Never mind that a bunch of cowboys and Indians could sneak up and attack an alien craft without being noticed, and they wouldn't be nuked or lasered or whatever. I was disappointed with the son/father line of the plot. The rich dad owning the town, the spoiled son, getting away with being a jerk. Come on, lets get some fresh ideas here.I'm not asking for realism, just believability.Postee",Cowboys & Aliens

341,MadMan400096,Every bit as stupid as its setup,1,29 July 2012,"""Cowboys & Aliens"" is what happens when a good director (Jon Favreau) makes a moronic abomination. Of course, you shouldn't blame him. Blame the five writers who still managed to louse it up.It's an already stupid setup (Western meeting Sci-Fi) executed just as badly as you'd expect. Daniel Craig's character has the name ""Jake Lonergan"". Ugh. Puns like these made me sick. But that's not all. The flick is pounded by a confusing plot, unengaging characters, CG that doesn't feel as good as it should, and utterly stupid and ridiculous plot twist: mysterious girl Ella being revived by fire. Are you kidding me!? It makes no sense (even for Sci-Fi), it destroys our willing suspension of disbelief, it's an utter disregard for basic biology, and it has a flimsy explanation-she's an alien. That's not an excuse! On top of that, it barely explains anything else about her, either! Her death by explosion actually make more sense than this.So, overall, this movie should not be watched by anyone. It's a brain dead mess.",Cowboys & Aliens
342,pmc127,Somewhere Between Good and Great...,6,29 July 2011,"First off, let me get it out of the way. This movie has cowboys and it has aliens. It lives up to its title. This movie is fun, exciting and intense. It is a very good summer movie. However, this film has a few flaws. First of all, the best part of this movie is Daniel Craig. His character is mysterious, quiet, and a TOTAL BADASS! After the introduction to his character, I was like, ""I'm in."" And he kept my attention throughout by being so awesome. The bracelet thing that is in the trailer is also really cool. The action in this movie is excellent. It's really well-made and -directed by Jon Faverau. Also, there is a lot more of the Western aspect of this movie than I was expecting, which is a good thing. The story in this movie moves fast and flows smoothly enough, However, in the movie titled Cowboys and Aliens, the story, while told fairly well, isn't really what matters. In my opinion, the biggest flaw of this movie is a scene in the middle involving a Native American tribal camp. Why is it a flaw? Because it tries to throw in a twist involving Olivia Wilde's character that is confusing and unneeded. That really brought the movie down for me, unfortunately. Also, Harrison Ford is not in this movie enough! He doesn't really do anything memorable until the end, unlike Craig, who is memorable during the whole movie. Speaking of the end, though it is epic and cool and all kinds of awesome, there is a point where a character is in trouble and another character goes to help him. I have seen enough movies to know that, ""he's probably going to die trying to save the other character."" Sure enough, two minutes later, BAM! Dead. Kind of cliché. The fusion of western and sci-fi works for the most part in this movie. The first 20 minutes of this movie is about 95% western, and the rest is 55% western and 45% sci-fi, until the end. I found it interesting how the cowboys are trying to fight the aliens with 1873 technology while the aliens have super-futuristic weaponry. The struggle is really cool to watch, and their eventual triumph is satisfying enough. The end feels kind of rushed, though all loose ends are tied up pretty well. After watching this movie, I was reminded of Super 8 for some reason. I think it is because both movies take an older, less modernly used genre - western and classic Spielberg (I consider that a genre) - and add a modern alien invasion story. However, both concentrate more on the characters than the alien aspect. I still think Super 8 is a much better film, though. This is still a fantastic summer movie. Though it may not be as much of a grand slam as other movies this season, Cowboys and Aliens is still fun time at the theater. 8.3/10",Cowboys & Aliens
343,lostjak,Good entertainment,5,30 July 2011,"I'm not sure what exactly I was expecting but it didn't quite reach the mark. I enjoyed it but didn't LOVE it. Towards the end in the action it began to remind me of The Goonies. The fact that there were cowboys, Indians, bandits & aliens was a plus! The acting was good, the casting was excellent, the script was OK. Not really believable as there were records kept at that time. Unlike Stargate or something where it left you with a thought process afterward. I wasn't really that keen on the cinematrogragy either. Just purely for entertainment. Certainly good for a escaping on a hot afternoon. I probably would not want to see it again though. For me that is enough to knock it out of the excellent range.",Cowboys & Aliens
344,aliloomis,Lackluster,6,3 August 2011,"I was pretty excited for this movie cause it had two amazing things for a movie: Cowboys and Aliens. And I love Harrison Ford. But after I saw some lackluster reviews and Ford's angry review rant on Conan, I was a little wary of spending money on it.I went and saw it and I can't say I regret it cause there are some amusing parts and Paul Dano is crazy good as the whiny son of Ford. But it seemed like just a summer movie with a simple plot but a convoluted back story. Nothing is ever really explained and there are plot strings waving in the breeze by the end of the movie. It also seems to be torn between a action film and a geek fest with its huge action scenes and snippets of information. Its like they couldn't decide what audience they were going for and, in the end, didn't really capture anyone's attention.About the actors: Daniel Craig can't act apparently cause he doesn't in this and he's almost too cool like it would be nice for him to lose at something. I felt it was a bit annoying and compared to Harrison Ford's depiction of a flawed cattle rancher, it was unfortunate. Another disappointment was Olivia Wilde. I watched her on House and I liked her there. In Cowboys and Aliens, she follows Craig around like a puppy and its kind of creepy how little acting she actually does. And the thrown in naked scene is sadly very short and not very explicit. If naked back turns you on then go for it but that's pretty much it.",Cowboys & Aliens

I'm not gonna give you a full lowdown on each character or the plot, i'm just gonna say if you want a decent action film then you could do worse than choosing this one.The effects are very good ,not too much like some films in these times of CGI.

346,CinemaJackIX,Why? How? I can't comprehend.,1,11 April 2012,"This movie had everything going for it. Let's have a look under the cinematic hood of this incredibly anti-climactic film shall we? This film had Jon Favreau as both director and executive producer- green light. The dream team, the most incredible line up of producers I've ever seen or heard: Brain Grazer-Green Light!, Ron Howard- GREEN LIGHT!, and Steven Spielberg- GREEN LIGHT!!! GREEN LIGHT!!! GREEN LIGHT!!! With a cast consisting of Daniel Craig- Green Light!, Harrison Ford- GREEN LIGHT!!!, Olivia Wilde- a fine Green Light, and Paul Dano- green light. All spoiled by a terrible script. What happened??? The concept is intriguing, it really is. In all alien movies, America is always ready with our military, but what if the aliens came at a time when we weren't ready? The old west for instance? Again a great concept! But terribly executed. The dumb aliens were after gold. Gold? Really? When Favreau tweeted about the film being like Jaws in the sense that you don't see the creature(s) for a bit of the movie because there is nothing scarier than your own imagination except the thought that Spielberg is starting to lose it. Ah, perish the thought. I kid of course, every dog has his day. I digress, we saw the alien within like 20 minutes, but there wasn't a build of suspense like Jaws.

It's got everything - action, comedy, romance, drama, pain, joy. Lots of characters with their own stories; but Daniel Craig shines as the eternal bad ass that he excels at.I love that everyone in this movie is fallible. As one character says ""Good people do bad things; bad people do good things"". No one is cookie cutter goodie or baddie. They're human beings, so they have both capable within them.My husband was practically bouncing in his seat during the action sequences. Funny, so was the guy behind me. And I think a guy to my left... The fights were realistic to the point where I was wincing. There was applause and cheering when the movie was done, and plenty of laughing and gasps throughout. My husband is grabbing his guy friends and going to see it again this week. I on the other hand am grabbing my girlfriends and going to see it too. Ha.*Spoiler. My husband's favorite part - the humans fighting the aliens get their families back at the end. Except for Daniel Craig's character - the traditional lone gunman of all the westerns.

And yet, somehow, the 'Curse of The Modern Day Spielberg' managed to defy all expectations and deliver a total damp squib. The story's weak (why capture the humans? why come to earth of all planets to mine for gold? how can one stolen gun destroy an entire operation?), the treatment confused (the whole Olivia Wilde arc), the actors under-utilized (somebody please stop the brutal destruction of everything that Harrison Ford has come to mean to moviegoers), and the action and thrills extremely underwhelming.Please do not go to see this movie.

351,Beowulf-29,A Thrilling Tribute to B-Flickery,1,30 July 2011,"What else can be said about a movie titled, ""Cowboys and Aliens?"" Not since the days of our dear Bella Legosi have we been forced to encounter a title so humorous and energy draining. The title itself was a draw back from the rest of the film; it would have been much more suspenseful if the title of the film had not revealed to the viewer right away that aliens would be featured. My dear wife summed up the entire plot of the film, ""Take the bracelet from the ""Scorpion King,"" put it on James Bond, marry that to ""Red Dead Redemption,"" and add a few blood- thirsty aliens."" The plot was very predictable, the dialog was cheap, corny, and amusing, and the effects seemed to hearken back to the days of the Playstation 2. Characters seemed flat, dull, and boring, while the only redeeming point about this movie was the performance of Clancy Brown (who played ""The Kurgen"" in the first ""Highlander"" movie), which really brought the whole B-movie experience full circle. My advice, invest your time and money in a more well deserving summer movie. Or better yet, go to the video store and rent one of the old Legosi or Carlof movies. You will get as many laughs from the ridiculous story and cheap dialog as you could from this movie, for a mere fraction of the cost.",Cowboys & Aliens

The opening scene was quite gruesome and in your face, I hoped the rest of the film could continue with the grittiness but alas it did not. It lived up to its 12 rating and teased with potential destruction only to fall short with a pop and fizzle.

This is pure entertainment and a fun ride. The mix of genres make for an interesting story and you wonder why we assume that alien sightings are often only part of contemporary culture- if it happens now, then it happened then- if you buy into them.Daniel Craig portrays the quintessential cowboy, short on dialogue and long on tough. Harrison Ford delivers with the kind of performance you'd expect from such a seasoned and respected actor- his angst is strong enough that he is believable as a not-so-good guy from the outset and as the reasons unfold for that angst you get it. The chemistry between the two of them lends to the pace of the film. And what could I possibly say about Olivia Wilde that would do her justice? The rest of the cast populates the film with a gritty, western feel that belies cleaner western of the past.

However, one of the main problems I had with it is that it doesn't think anything through to a decent conclusion - it's just a question of ""yeah, that's cool, we'll throw that in, doesn't matter if it makes sense or not!"" For example, if the aliens have bad eyesight in the daytime, why do they go out on scouting missions during the day? Are the scout ships manned or unmanned? If they're manned (as is suggested at one point), why did they leave the crashed ship in the town without checking it for signs of life? And so on and so on.One of the major issues that I had with this was the total and utter waste of the talent on hand. Why shovel in so many awesome actors like Harrison Ford, Clancy Brown, Sam Rockwell and Olivia Wilde if you just sideline them all and don't allow them to do what they do best? And the revelation as to who Olivia Wilde's character is was just.........nonsense to be honest. If something had been made of it, then that would have made sense but ultimately, it just felt like one plot twist too far.That being said, Daniel Craig was cool being a bad-ass and the smack down at the end was kinda fun - it's also surprisingly brutal for a movie rated 12A in the UK.Probably not worth making an effort to see it at the cinema, just wait for it to hit DVD or Sky.",Cowboys & Aliens

The story line brings my rating to ""5 or below"".What drops my rating from a 5 to 4 is the use of clichés - the boy given a knife to become a man, one leader saving another leader in the heat of battle - then the nod of acceptance. One after another, all very bad.What takes my rating from a 4 to a 3 is the fact that the special effects are not special. Fires and explosions look a bit fake. Aliens either move too fast or are too dark to really enjoy the effects. Flying devices are never really disclosed as to what they are. All very disappointing given the advancement of special effects.I'm left wondering why Ford and Craig took the parts.",Cowboys & Aliens
367,barr18,Excitingly Unique,5,26 November 2011,"The best part about the film is the actors performances, which really helped the feel of western culture. This film is defiantly worth watching with its many sub stories and few scares but I feel the film could of been a bit better when it came to consistency, for example how easily the aliens could be killed by arrows but other times bullets did not make them flinch. The film can start to drag in areas which nothing is happening, exaggerating relationships between each character making the film much longer than it needed to be. The film gives the audience a good mix of action scenes between human and aliens as well as humans with humans, most of which are very well done. I can end this review by saying any fans of aliens, history, action or good acting then watch this movie!",Cowboys & Aliens

The movie has more haters than lovers, but that shouldn't keep you from watching this epic film because you may end up loving it. I had friends who went to go see it who loved it and I had family members who went to see it who hated it. When I first saw the trailer of this movie before I saw Green Lantern I was iffy if I wanted to go see it, but the time came when I just had to go see it. To my amazement I was dazzled. I pretty much loved the movie. Yeah it is no where compared to the graphics and action of Transformers, but this movie was great in it's own way. After I saw the movie I read all the critiques on this site and they said the plot is confusing or is missing, but that is not true. This was a very realistic plot. It is the story of war and survival like many others. Acting: 10/10 Action: 7/10 because the aliens were really subpar characters. they could have done a better job.

He saw ""Alien"" as an important film for me to see and noted it was groundbreaking in the Sci-Fi genre.That said, ""Cowboys and Aliens"" is no ""Alien"" but I still enjoyed it. Maybe I am sucker for the actors, Daniel Craig and his well-played outsider and Harrison Ford's arrogance and insolence. Maybe I just like sitting in a cool theater on a terribly hot summer day. I was not sorry that I saw the film.I enjoyed this film better than some of the other summer blockbuster films I have seen. Yes, there are flaws but the action is captivating and the premise is one that resonates in every good v. evil film. Overall, this is why I think this film is a worthy summer film: I found the characters believable. - I found myself taken away by the story. - I enjoyed the gritty scenery and the special effects were very realistic. - I found myself on the edge of my seat at certain points. - I rooted for the good guys.Is it Academy Award worthy? Doubtful. But if you are just looking for a short break from the real world, this film will take you away on that sweet little trip. And how can you beat seeing Daniel Craig in chaps? Thank you, Jon Favreau! ;-)",Cowboys & Aliens

I had been counting down the days until C&A was released since I saw the first trailer, and in my eyes it delivered.Despite a few plot holes, it had pretty much everything you could ask for in a summer movie: persistent action, characters that you came to care about, realistic western environment, terrific acting from top to bottom as you would expect from the all-star likes of Craig, Ford, Rockwell, Wilde, as well as an almost scene-stealing performance by Dano, but the lesser names also were very solid.Daniel Craig pulled of a terrific American accent when needed, although the ""strong and silent"" approach fit his character perfectly, he came across as a total bad ass.Harrison Ford was very believable as the gruff, weathered old colonel, in what is his best performance that I have watched.Olivia Wilde. Need I say more? She naturally pulls off the sultry, soft-spoken demeanor that was required for her part, yet still manages to be someone who's bad side you wouldn't want to be on. And of course, she looks ridiculously sexy even while dressed from head-to-toe in a tablecloth of a dress.Overall, as long as you don't go into the cinema expecting an extremely deep and brooding plot, you will come out feeling as though your money was well spent. It doesn't out-stay it's welcome, and the great acting and well paced action will leave you wanting more. 9/10",Cowboys & Aliens

I know what some of the criticisms are and I agree, to a point.It's been said that Daniel Craig isn't the best ""cowboy type"" for the film, but to me that's the point. He wakes up in the middle of the desert with a weird bracelet on. I think casting Craig for this role keeps you guessing. Is he one of the aliens in the title? You have to watch the whole thing almost to discover the answer through flashbacks. Craig plays a great western tough.As for Ford, I found his performance somewhat stiff, but frankly, he's always that way and this is no ""Regarding Henry"" or ""Witness"". To me, Ford's performance in any of the ""Indiana Jones"" movies were no better. But they were fun, and that's the point. He's made better movies. That said, I like Harrison Ford and give him the benefit of the doubt. His is a supporting role.As for Olivia Wilde, you get the idea she's ""not one of us"" fairly early on, but it's just an inkling, you don't know for sure until later. I'm really not that familiar with her. What is she supposed to do? She plays an alien in human form. They could have made her part more interesting, but it's only a two hour flick.We rented the movie from Blockbuster, so I couldn't see the extended version, but I liked ""Cowboys and Aliens"" enough to want to buy the blu-ray in order to do that, so either that means I liked the movie or I'm stupid.

After buying the DVD and watching this move 3 times I realized that I would have paid full price to watch this movie not once, but twice. John Wayne would have been proud of this movie. So would have many other cowboy legends such as Roy Rogers. Not only was the base of the story well thought out the cast, crew and other members of this film worked really hard to entertain us. There are basic morals taught in this film if the viewer would jus pay attention. As far as Christian lessons carefully placed the writers could not have done a better job. Family values soared throughout this tale. This wasn't just a Sci-Fi-Western mix film. This is a brand new way to look at human struggles and how to beat the odds. This a fresh way to look into our hearts and learn to fight as a band for our survival. The odd thing there is a tremendous amount of sacrifice made all the way throughout the movie. And let's not forget about the humor. There is a subtle funny line at least every few minutes. For a viewer like myself I had to watch it 3 times since I really wanted to understand the deep message.

But, in order to deliver that up to the expectations and (sometimes beyond that) you either need Sergio Leone mixing with H.G. Wells or you need either of Scorsese, Kubrick or Nolan who I think are very few directors who can actually make you visualize whatever you ever imagined. The movie starts slow and gradually takes speed (just like you would expect from a westerner) but when the first attack takes place seemed to be the peak of the movie. Till that time, music miserably fails which puts life in a westerner and hence gradually the feel of a westerner seems to wane. Although at the time of the first attack, it feels like that you are getting the feeling of watching a horror, Sci-Fi and a noir. Harrisson Ford could have taken the feel from blade runner but right after this point, movie fails to pick up. Movie could have picked up from this point and taken a better speed but compared to last year's True Grit, this movie, I believe, will fail to live up to the expectations of the audience.

Oscar nods will come from this role. excellent cinematography, great story, flows well, and of course, great aliens and space crafts from the Spielberg clan.

The intent of ""Cowboys and Aliens"" was to mash up two B-movie genres, the western and the alien monster. The problem is that, unless the script brings some originality beyond the usual genre tropes, the result is just another B-movie. Lucas and Spielberg both showed how to pull off hommages right; ""Cowboys and Aliens"" fails on most counts. Character development is poor all around, with the most egregious being that of Ella Swenson. She carries a highly important plot thread in the movie, but is as disposable as any of the anonymous black hats dragged off their horses in the climactic battle. One should also remind movie makers that successful monsters have to be scary; and this is no longer possible just by creating hordes of big ugly CGI creatures.

Everything in between are dusts, blastings, horse riding, and more dusts. The plot is boring.It would have beautifully unfold into an Oscar-worthy Western film if they took out the aliens and evolved the story around the unique characters like Percy, Nat Colorado, Dollarhyde, Doc, the boy Emmett. They have stories to tell, they have dramas to share. BUt since, this is based on a graphic novel, they can't take out the monsters.Surely, they could have developed the plot by adding more exciting elements. What about the cowboys having improved weapons due to an alien like Olivia Wilde's character, who taught them an advanced technology? Then the war could have ensued better, making it a real action flick with all the special effects. (What is Olivia Wilde doing there again, aside from being the representative of the female population and seducing? Didn't she burn in the fire and arise like a phoenix, back from the dead, but died in the explosion of the towership? Weird.)The characters didn't connect much due to the boring plot.

There's some common tropes and formulas, but nothing that stands out so bad that it becomes a cliché or really hurts your enjoyment of the movie. All the actors--and there's a huge amount of talent here--do a great job at making their roles into real people--no saints, no villains, just folks with their own quirks and flaws. Doubly so for Harrison Ford, who manages to take what could otherwise be a cardboard cutout antagonist and give him real depth.

There was the general western theme to the movie, with brief intense pieces of classic sci-fi alienery throughout. So if you want to see some good western shootouts, you will, however, with the other futuristic alien weaponry everything seems too out of place and does take a bit of the western magic away.

Warning, the good dialogue comes at the beginning, the good horse riding comes in the middle, and the embarrassing face you make when cringing comes at the end. Yes, this is a popcorn film (I ate my whole bag), but it also does an excellent job putting some real hitch in the giddy up of cowboy flicks. Daniel Craig shines as rough, reluctant hero, and really stuck it to the producers of Bond for not continuing his reign (making hearing him speak in an American accent all the more odd). Jon Favreau once again brought a pleasant grounding to what could easily slip into Michael Bay-let's just blow things up and move the camera really fast-territory. I am reminded of his insistence on ""Elf"" to do as many in-camera effects as possible before resorting to CGI, lending the tipping point of keeping it reasonable and earning his place at the table with the big boy producers of this film. As a fan of early cowboy films of Ford, Wayne, Huston, and Steward, I was pleased to see the pacing and emphasis on the journey honored. This film is more about riding than stare offs. I just wish the destination was as much fun as the chase. At times it seemed like a chore to continue stabbing and shooting the aliens.

The film stays true to its western setting, the characters are realistic (though I do wish their backgrounds were fleshed out a little more), and, more than anything, the acting is fantastic.The plot is straightforward. The biggest complaint seems to be the simplicity of the script. It's uncomplicated, yes, but I liked it that way. Will it have the most intricate, twisting plot you've ever seen? No. And with a title like Cowboys and Aliens, it doesn't pretend to. But will it make you laugh and cheer? Yes. In fact people did both several times at the theater I was in. All in all, it's a very entertaining action film with some touching, heartfelt moments. I'll probably see it again and I'll definitely be getting the DVD.",Cowboys & Aliens
401,nexussunfire,Good Summer Movie (Cast Would've made a good pure western),8,30 July 2011,"It's not a block buster really. But it is a really good summer movie. The cast did a pro job at making it feel believable. By doing so they manage to pull you into the setting and the action just enough to make it worth watching. However I feel that if there had been a much better script available.. cutting the science fiction out completely a really good western movie would have come out of it. I would have preferred to see such a good cast in that movie more than this movie. (If that makes sense)As in all of Jon Favreau's movies there is the notch special effects. But the aliens... didn't come off as quite evil enough to make you really feel intimidated or even hate them. They're just there sort of... in the way. Annoying mosquito's. While the dialogue is good in the film there are plot cliché's that really detract from the whole movie. There were some things that could have been done that would have made it feel/draw a much better reaction as a whole.Anyway, don't let that stop you from seeing it. It is still a good summer action flick to sit down and eat popcorn, and sip down a favorite beverage while watching it. There is some good timed points of humor and even some things only science fiction fans would really catch in it, that make the small successes it does have all the more enjoyable!",Cowboys & Aliens
402,swearingen-jo,Exactly what the name says it is,7,31 July 2011,"A good cowboy movie, an OK sci-fi aliens attack movie.Harrison Ford gives a solid performance.Daniel Craig fans won't be disappointed, since he speaks very little. He grunts, mumbles, and his piercing blue eyes express confusion and not much else.The best part? Daniel Craig's rear end clad in leather chaps. Whenever the plot slows, his posterior gets a closeup. It may get a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination.I was disappointed in the cinematography. We saw it in 2d. It was filmed in beautiful country, but sweeping vistas were flat with very little depth of field. Compared with Silverado, this film fell far short of breathtaking.",Cowboys & Aliens
403,Sspidel1,Better than what you've heard,8,8 August 2011,"Okay, here's the thing. I pride myself on knowing a good movie when I see one. Some of my favorites are The Departed, Doctor Zhivago, Singin' in the Rain, Annie Hall, Closer and The Terminator (mostly the first one, when the those involved were hungry for an engaging story and were forced to be creative rather than rely on CGI). That being said, I think I enjoyed this movie because I knew EXACTLY what to expect when I bought my ticket. When people watch a movie and forget the spirit in which it's made it really irritates me. I'm seeing reviews for this movie that are filled with plot issues and lack of CGI precision. We are not talking about a movie that promises a deep script or stellar CGI. We are talking about a creative romp. A fun, summer movie that's meant to entertain. I thought it was fun, had just enough cowboy grittiness (Daniel Craig is tough and rugged but VERY aesthetically pleasing and Harrison Ford is pitch perfect as the crotchety, cantankerous Dolarhyde) and moments to make you jump. How can an intelligent person go to a movie entitled ""Cowboys and Aliens"" and be disappointed that it was about cowboys and aliens? Don't go in expecting Shakespeare meets Avatar, for cryin' out loud. Suspend belief. Give artistic license. It's very simple and so some people are making it harder than it has to be. It was fun.

I have to vent out my anger and frustration after watching this so called movie..This is the worst Hollywood movie ever made in recent times is ""Cowboys & Aliens"".. Worst story line, Worst screen play, Worst visual effects, Worst dialog, Worst acting, Worst direction, Worst production value......Watch it to know what makes a movie super flop show, watch it to know what a movie would look like if everything in it would go wrong!!I don't know how this director and producers take guts and had face to get in front of the media and premier shows after making this flop show full of jokers running here and there without any direction....

This one had six credited executive producers, five producers, four co-producers, five writers, two ""stars"" in the leads who haven't had a box office hit for ages and as source material a graphic novel nobody knows. We also have a awful lot of genres mixed together, whereas two of them, Western and Scifi, fits so much to each other like Harrison Ford's chest hair waxing to deforestation of the rain forest. BTW, dear Harrison, they do not ""wax"" the rain forest, they burn it down! Maybe you should have done the same to your chest hairs...Daniel Graig is probably more Bond in this movie than he was in his recent rather experimental Bond adaption. He has his high-tech gadget! The movie cost $165 million, another $150 million to market it worldwide. So it probably needs to do $400 to break even. Nothing seems to fit, at least the budget and the $36.2 million the movie made over its first weekend.Well, the title doesn't fit, its horrible actually. The movie makes no sense anyway, and you don't need Harrison Ford in a refrigerator for realizing that. But somehow Harrison Ford should have fit into this mess of genres, wasn't he Indiana Jones and Han Solo at the same time?

406,helluvvangel,Worst Western and Sci Fi ever,1,8 August 2011,I expected so much more. The concept was a total run away that could have been an award winner BUT the overall concept failed. This is one of the most boring movies i have seen in forever. My mind can think of many ways this movie could have really blown you away. It seems they had a great idea but didn't know how to make it work. There's many things that are never answered in the movie as if it didn't matter. Great actors with a bad script. Im surprised they wanted to be a part of this disaster. It seems they had a very low budget with most of it shot in a prop town and the dessert. Not much was spent on the aliens nor their spacecraft and ships. It just irratates me that it could have been so much better. I woulnt classify this as sci-fi it was more western althugh I've seen way better westerns. Some movies i say don't pay to see but this one is don't waste you time watching it. Im not sure even kids would like this movie. Im glad there was no opening for part 2.,Cowboys & Aliens

409,bmhuinker64,Great (especially compared to Super 8),9,9 December 2011,"Unlike Super 8 (which I was very, VERY disappointed with), this was a real alien movie. It's completely different as far as overall plot and feel of the film, but since they both have aliens, I'm drawing the comparison. It's no District 9, if that's what you're looking for. If you're looking great Action, campy Wester, Sci-Fi, or a mix of all of them then you're watching the right movie. The name says it all. Good acting, but again, GREAT ACTION! For what it was trying to be, it exceeded expectations. Daniel Craig does not disappoint and Olivia Wilde was cast well for her part. I don't normally write reviews, but seeing of the less than generous reviews on here, I felt very compelled. I feel that the other people writing reviews watch every movie and look for Oscar worthy content. That is no way to enjoy the movies and this film is the best example of that. I watched this film because I love alien movies and knew there was going to be a ton of action (which there was). Also there was a twist or two thrown in for some errs and awws. I stand by my original rating of 9/10. Again, Jon F. did not set out to get an Oscar nod, he set out to make a great Sci-Fi Action Adventure. This is what this movie is.",Cowboys & Aliens

However, the aura of alien creatures, it can also make movies mystery hidden fear and danger. The film itself will sag in the cowboy era. But there are these alien technology that has been immortalized not less.

413,theodorepilgrim,Another comic to film tragedy.,3,8 October 2011,"Being an avid comic reader and a religious follower of Western themed films, this movie was designed for me. Based off the graphic novel of the same name, Cowboys & Aliens is a Sci-fi cross Western Action movie which follows the story of the amnesia ridden criminal named Jake Lonergan (Daniel Craig) and his quest to recover his memory. The story more specifically starts with Jake waking up in the middle of the desert with a metal bracelet attacked to his hand, irremovable. After beating some random men, he heads to the city of Absolution. It is revealed to Jake that he is a known and wanted criminal and the sheriff takes him into custody. An unknown race of aliens attack and kidnap more than half the town's population and in the spur of the action, Jake's bracelet reveals itself to be a dangerous and effective hand cannon, resulting in the destruction of one of the alien jets. The alien pilot gets away without anybody glimpsing it and they gather a posse to 'find their people'. Thus begins their journey across the Arizona desert. Jake Lonergan, Colonel Woodrow Dolarhyde (Harrison Ford), Ella Swenson (Olivia Wilde) and a gathering of minor characters such as Doc, Meacham, Emmett, Nat and some others are part of the posse. Jake Lonergan is the only name you will really catch onto, because this is one of those movies where storyline focuses on one character's back story and giving the finger to the rest of the characters. Being the Western fan that I am, I expected a Western movie with Sci-fi elements, but all I got was a Sci-fi movie with little-to-no Western at all. It was rumoured that the film went through many story writers, which isn't expected of a movie that's based off a graphic novel, with a story already written. However, the events of the graphic novel have nothing to do with the film. The events of the graphic novel have the aliens (with a name, 'The Caste',) wanting to enslave the human race as they have done to many other races before. A group of gunslingers and a tribe of Apaches join forces and scavenge technology from a destroyed ship to create weapons of their own, such as a microwave emitting pistol, an energy whip and x-ray goggles. A blacksmith also crafts horse-shoes that allow their horses defy gravity to a certain degree using engine parts from the ship. Using this technology, they defeat The Caste with many casualties and for their bravery and valour; they are added to the forces of many other extra-terrestrial races standing against The Mighty Caste. Now that's what I call a story! Instead we get this. Amnesia, faceless characters, horrible back stories and more.I feel that the graphic novel story is much better than the movie's adaption. Basically, we are told that the aliens want... Gold. Yep, gold. That's all they want. There's no reason why they want gold, its just said it's a rare to them as it is to us. But we use our gold for jewellery and other useless items. And by the look of those aliens, jewellery is the last thing on their list of things they would need. Now this part contains spoilers for the film, but it's what ruined it for me the most. During a flashback induced by Indian herbal tea, Jake witnesses his wife turned to ash by the aliens and he is next. The alien conducting the 'live autopsies' takes his weapon bracelet off (even though he kept it on for the previous experiments on Jake's wife,) and puts it right next to Jake's hand. Oh, I wonder what will happen next. Well, Jake uses the Alien's 'plasma scalpel' to cut half of it's face off and accidentally gets the bracelet caught on his hand. He then escapes, completely without any resistance and then mysteriously loses his memory... During the strategic attack on the alien ship, Jake gives his bracelet to Ella to self destruct in the ships core, leaving him with a pistol which is about effective as throwing small pebbles at the aliens. In his second escape from the ship, he is captured again and strapped up to the operating table once more. Now what happened now, could have been seen a mile away. It's the alien with the scarred face! And he wants revenge. Though, what kind of a movie would it be if the hero was captured, tortured and then murdered, leaving all the others fighting against the aliens to be overwhelmed and killed? Well, it would have been better than the actual ending, that's for sure. And so the inevitable happens, Jake escapes, kills the revengeful alien and escapes, just as Ella self destructs the bracelet in the core of the fleeing ship. BOOM, BANG, a bad reunion scene between the characters and the movie has ended. Thank God. 118 minutes of horrible story, horrible characters, horribly thought out aliens and a HORRIBLE ending. I wasn't aware of who directed the film until after I had seen the movie. Jon Favreau? The same guy who adapted the Ironman comics into a movie and successful sequel? But those movies were actually good. I guess a bad movie could happen to anybody.I'm aware that movie reviews are for opinions and thoughts on the movie, but all I can think of is the words; horrible and bad. Maybe it wouldn't be AS horrible for me if I wasn't such a fan of Western films and the graphic novel. But I just can't imagine a movie such as 'Once Upon a Time in the West' with aliens coming in half way through actually turning out as a well balanced, good storied film. Just another movie in a series of comic-to-film tragedies. Now to wait for the next two ruinations; 'The Amazing Spiderman' and 'The Avengers'.",Cowboys & Aliens
414,peterjcarney-215-147200,Could have been a classic comedy,5,5 August 2015,"I have apparently been a member of IMDb for 3 years and 8 months during which I have never felt the need to write a review. I enjoy reading the reviews on here very much and for me that was enough, until now.Having avoided watching Cowboys and Aliens for over 3 years(due in no small part to the reviews), I came across the extended version for a $1.49 and thought what the heck.I was not expecting much to be frank but during the very first scene a man grabs a small shotgun type weapon from his holster, the gun is made of polystyrene or other cheap plastic and almost flies out of his hands for being too light. You could say it's bad acting and god knows who teaches the doctors on Greys Anatomy to carry those disposable paper coffee cups that are so obviously empty but this is just a different level. It caught my eye so completely that I started to look at the set and props. Spoiler.Then next up is Big Dan's Alien wristband, that is clearly and undeniably made of plastic, not even a mystery metal look is available from the prop man. A trip to the 99 cent store to buy a He-Man (and the Masters of the Universe) children's fancy dress pack is all that is necessary for $163,000,000 budget to be utilised effectively. Needless to say that when Big Dan arrives in town for the first time it is clear that the town is the cardboard cut-out one from Blazing Saddles. At last I realise this is a spoof comedy, stop taking it so seriously...Spoiler; The Indians who do and don't understand English are hilarious and I think the writers got the ideas from that Clint Eastwood film with the funny Indian who can't sneak up on anyone. There are so many just unbelievable one-liners that this film (even ""Whisky"" is so funny) may achieve a cult status some day.This film was supposed to be an Airplane! meets Blazing Saddles meets Men in Black. Personally I was more concerned the Men in White were going to take me away I was laughing so much.",Cowboys & Aliens

As a matter of fact I was anticipating so much more from the rest of it after watching them. 10 minutes in you kind of find the movie living up to its big-name actors and semi large budget.After the first ""alien attack"" I found myself urging for a fast forward button through every single dialogue in the movie. I don't have words to describe how bad the storyline is, but it isn't bad enough for you to watch it to find out, so huge spoiler alert for those who are reading this and actually are going to watch this, read no more. For those who want to read the storyline summarized, here goes: A dude wakes up in the desert, he's been abducted but he just walked out of the Alien cave (More like a gold mine, but it's a cave). He is equipped with Alien weaponry that fits like tailormade for his wrist. He kills some dudes, goes to town, gets his drink on, meets a girl (who is an alien who ""took this form""), I think they hook up despite the fact that she isn't human or even a woman, they defeat the aliens by fighting Indian, white man and crooks together, the aliens are here to take over the earth for its GOLD RESERVES.3/10 for a hot female actor, the first 10 minutes and because Harrison Ford is in it, although his character is nothing more than a clichè.",Cowboys & Aliens

I thought there were some good actions scenes. I did watch the entire movie and gave it a chance, but I started to lose interest about half way through and the excitement never returned.

The time in our history was unique as well! I'd actually look forward to a sequel. Which for me is always a thumbs up right there! Cowboys and Aliens will never be award winning stuff.

The most error committed by the filmmaker in my opinion... boring.

Absolutely do not waste your time on the DVD, even if your buddy lends it to you. You will be ticked off that you wasted the 2 hours. The story is such a garbage bag of camp movie idioms that it is impossible to achieve that willing suspension of disbelief. It is scriptwriter masturbation gone bad after too many scotches. I can visualize the writers getting drunker and drunker, stupider and stupider, trying to one up each other with crazier and crazier ideas.

420,johnny-m-knowles,A B-Movie...but in a good way!,8,21 January 2020,"I've just watched Cowboys & Aliens, yes I know I'm very late to the party and I'm sure I've been late to the party for the same reason that anyone else how'd see the trailer would be i.e. think ""That's a load of crap"" but then bother to have a look at some point anyway out of curiosity. It is obviously billed, perceived and promoted as a B-movie with an A-list cast but then why if it is a B-movie would the likes of Spielberg, Ford, Craig, Paul Dano and the 'he can do no wrong"" Sam Rockwell bother to be associated with it? I can only assume that it was sold to them in some way that it has been assumed by myself, it's going to be a kids film (12A), Spielberg doing his usual 'family' alien (they could be good or bad guys) spiel, or simply that, 'yes it's a B-film...but with an A-list cast!'You see most 'good' B-movies are such because they basically have a very extraordinary set of circumstances to separate it from the usual B-movies, so it can rise above the others and promote itself to a type of cult statues, making it stand out from the crowd and be picked up by the masses. However the reason this usually happens is because they possess a greater premise, idea, storyline, script or interpretation by an auteur, cinematographer, director, actor etc. or all of the above. So maybe it is a good idea for mainstream Hollywood and therefore mainstream film viewers, to watch B-movies, but they will never do this unless there is a great cast or director/producer connected to it. So is this stealing of good ideas/talent from indie from Hollywood or an encouragement to smaller productions? That's a question too hard for me to answer so I will not go anywhere near it.What I want to talk about is the film itself, as I said I went into it thinking it would be poor but there was enough curiosity for me to dedicate the 2 hours to watch it. I never stop watching a film no matter how bad it is so I can have a full conclusion and opinion on it, however this was not a problem with Cowboys & Aliens.It starts like a generic Western, with its purposely planed stereotypes: 'Man with no name' = anti-hero, a wealthy, greedy land owner; a cocky, clueless rich kid; an unyielding law-man; a femme fatale; a down on his luck, proud driven by love, pioneer and a preacher...plus a kid and a dog. Later we're introduced to the Native Americans. When the aliens are introduced, yes we think it's ridiculous and unrealistic, however I've lost count of the amount of times I've heard people talk about ""realism"" in sci-fi content (which differs from believable)! There are also generic action sequences to keep the audience entertained (jumping on the flying saucer straight out of an Indiana Jones Film), however I'm here to sing my very surprised praise.This film made me wonder if Spielberg thought ""the amount of times we've made films about aliens coming to earth in the modern day (at the time the film's made), why not think about what would happen if aliens came to earth in a different era?"" Now we have to excuse him being American and therefore only think about how far back in American history they can go, but why not think about 'what would happen if hostile aliens visited a hostile environment and time in American history?' Good idea! Why not?Also the real message of the film is about people coming together for a common course, no matter what creed, colour, age, gender, background or even species! The only thing they miss out is ability (distinct lack of disabled people in this film!) there is obviously an alien helping the humans, as well as a dog doing whatever he can do.You might be mistaken in thinking that director Jon Favreau would be making a fluff film, due to his acting CV, however his directorial CV is a little better and he delivers pretty much what you might expect as well as the undercurrent that you may not, or I may have read more in to this film then is really there (which is more than likely). So in the end it shows people coming together to fight a common enemy (associate any modern conflict you'd dare to) drawing on one of America's biggest historical embarrassments (the Native American) they feel comfortable admitting to.So in one respect it's just a GOOD old fashioned action film, or a western, or sci-fi, or B-movie but maybe more than that...or maybe I've had too much to drink!",Cowboys & Aliens

I for myself had a lot of fun watching it, maybe just a bit too much on the epic, high amp emotional side, there's compromises with the story and depth, but a side from that, many many great details and good acting.I think the movie earns a much better name, ""Cowboys & Aliens"" is just too blunt, too many associations, doesn't seem to mix - like oil and water. Besides that, sounds pretty childish. Maybe something like ""Mineshaft"", ""Shadow Miners"", ""Hide & Shells"" - alright this is Luke-warm too, I lack the English to get it to the point here - would have improved the experience for other unsatisfied watchers.

The lead actor was good also. I also think it have been interesting if the alien were benevolent instead of malevolent. I would have also liked to have seen the alien's physical match up with the cowboy to be a little more even. The mother ship was pretty original too.

This movie does both very well.Nothing is glaringly of and in no way deserving of 6.1 the same score some serious stinkers have.I am not going to continue to wade through the mass of drivel here to deciede if somebody has a grudge against the makers or if people are just grinches for anything less then Oscar winning material. Probably the same reasons average movies like inglorius bastards and batman2 and 3 get such high ratings. Shiny trinkets and meaningless geegaws impress the savage unwashed pseudo intellectual masses. While gold and diamonds are used as paving stones for the hairy missshaped morlock feet.,Cowboys & Aliens
426,heyyou-kc,Boring,2,18 November 2011,So I kind of thought the fire scene was awesome though I saw it coming. Which about sums up the rest of my review...Totally predictable. And not in a humorous or nostalgic way. Through out the film I was having this unofficial competition with my co-watchers about who was going to be right. Except we all agreed. So it was more of a competition of who could say it faster. My boredom presented about 1/3 into the flick and it didn't save me from the wrath of my friends who argued that it was my idea to catch it. There were so many ridiculous scenes that the most enjoyment came from ragging on the...the...thing. I liked and continue to like all of the actors involved. This was just the most worthless piece of crap I've scene on the big screen ever....Besides maybe 28 Weeks Later which I walked out of due to vomit reflex.,Cowboys & Aliens
427,marcd-parrott,We have to do better as a species,1,9 May 2020,"Pure, rotten garbage. Not a salvageable frame of screen time. A marvel of ineptitude. How does a cast of this magnitude agree to such embarrassment? You can answer that question for yourself, but we all know why and can leave it unspoken.This movie is just gross. Not Air force One-bad, but it does of course star the common denominator, Mr. Ford, who continues to prove that there's no bar low enough that he can't limbo under for a payday. We need to do people. We're better than this. It makes me want to die. Let's try harder, Hollywood!",Cowboys & Aliens
428,teiskildegaard,Boring,3,21 February 2020,What a stupid story... it just end up being really boring. So many cliche in one movie is almost not possible. It is almost a comedy even as its try to be an actionmovie. It's like sharknado but without the ironi.,Cowboys & Aliens
429,sksachinkumarcool,Storyline was not so good. Average movie.,5,17 March 2019,The movie was good. But it will be more better. The storyline will be a bit more entertaining. But although it's enough for me. Harrison Ford always be my favourite.,Cowboys & Aliens
430,jadepandapaw,Jon Favreau delivers!,10,21 December 2020,The perfect blend of westerns and aliens! Serves the western genre Nostalgia with a believable sci-fi twist.,Cowboys & Aliens
431,wxbee29,Worst Movie,1,4 March 2013,"By far one of the worst movies we have ever seen. Terrible acting by major actors Craig and Ford. In ""sensitive"" scenes, it appeared like actors were suppressing laughter. Characters were clichéd from the past 75 years. Movie was totally boring & we couldn't wait for it to end. Some of the animated characters and scenes were not realistic. The whole story was a cliché. Story line seemed to be stolen from many other movies. ""Alien"" characters were laughable and not convincing as real protagonists. I was looking forward to seeing this movie, but was vastly disappointed in it. Story was not worthy of the trouble of making it a movie.",Cowboys & Aliens
432,imdb-11079,Awful,1,7 October 2012,"This movie is so bad that even stoned out of my mind on narcotics and unable to leave the house recovering post-surgery with nothing else to watch, I still couldn't finish it. Plot less, terrible acting, awful effects; simply no redeeming value at all.I wanted to watch this purely on the strength of Olivia Wilde's previous work, especially _House_, but even she couldn't carry it. And her acting in this production was no better than the rest of the cast.I will never understand how such an otherwise excellent cast produced this junk.Maybe the second half is better, but I'll never find out.",Cowboys & Aliens
433,ReynoldsBoat,Six Shooters & Evil Aliens,7,4 August 2011,"Western and sci-fi together at last, to many this is an odd fit. But who says aliens only visited our planet after the American industrial revolution? That being said, I went into the cinema with moderate expectations, and it moderately delivered. The movie had an intriguing opening. Daniel Craig wakes up having no memory of his life or knowledge of this gauntlet locked on his arm. He comes across the tiny town of Absolution where trouble seems to find him. Then from the movie title you can figure out what happens next. Classic to Jon Favreau movies the situational humor is really good, particularly with the town doctor and Han Solo's son. Daniel Craig gave a fine performance in his gritty cowboy role whose moral compass is to be a provider the best way he knows how. The fragmented revelations and the visual effects from Craig's flashbacks were great. Olivia Wilde and Harrison Ford made for an entertaining trio to watch. Unfortunately, after the first alien attack on the town the plot freezes in carbonite. The Aliens have discovered the great American gold rush on earth, so they must exterminate humanity in order to harvest it. But we are never told what they actually use the gold for. The aliens looked disappointing and resembled human form too much. Then while Craig is vaporizing aliens with his gauntlet laser, the aliens prefer to fight back with their fists! Apparently the aliens drank too much slurm and forget all of their gauntlet laser's back on the mothership. The Final Say: Cowboys & Aliens is a fun summer action flick, but had left some potential in the dust. (7.5/10)",Cowboys & Aliens
