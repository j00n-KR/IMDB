0,MartinHafer,the dumbness of some story elements ruin the movie for me,4,6 June 2005,"The music is nice, so I'll give it a 4 for the songs. As for the rest of the film, I just don't see why it has received so much attention (particularly from the Oscars). Perhaps the problem lies within me because I just can't get past the fact that this is a musical about two effeminate street gangs. I saw the movie all the way through as a kid, but in my 30s I tried watching it again and just couldn't keep watching. When the Jets and Sharks (or whatever their names were) started fighting, I found myself laughing uncontrollably as they danced and pranced and skipped across the stage! I am originally from Washington, DC, and ANY gang behaving like THAT sure wouldn't last long!",West Side Story
1,TheLittleSongbird,One of the most electrifying musicals ever made!,10,25 February 2009,"This is probably the best musical ever made. It is fantastic!!! It is loosely based on Romeo and Juliet, but it means that west Side Story had an inspiration, and it is told movingly and powerfully. Right from minute one I knew we were going to be in for a treat. The prologue was brilliantly staged, as was the rumble, which I found a bit disturbing to be honest! Quintet was thrilling also. Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood are wonderful as the two lovers, Wood is very heartfelt and Marni Nixon's singing for her is the very definition of angelic, as is Russ Tamblyn as a very energetic Riff. George Chakiris is also good as Bernado, though I would have given the Best Supporting Actor Oscar to Tamblyn, but it is Rita Moreno as fiery Anita who impressed most, easily one of the best supporting turns of any musical. The songs are fantastic, one of those musicals where every song works, some are funny; ""America""(amazing choreography) and ""Officer Krupkee"" and some heart rending ones; ""Tonight"" ""One Hand One Heart"" and ""Somewhere"". The choreography was enough to have you on the edge of your seat. Everything is right about this movie, and I am shocked it isn't in the top 250, because it should be for it is one of the greatest film musicals! 10/10 without question! Bethany Cox",West Side Story
2,bkoganbing,"As Maria Said, So Pretty, Witty, & Bright",10,20 July 2008,"It's hard for me to write a review about West Side Story because all the superlatives have been written and said over and over again. What I think the main contribution of West Side Story to our culture is to interest urban American youth of the Fifties in both the classics and the American Musical Theater. A typical boy or girl going to Andries Hudde Junior High School and Midwood High School from 1959 to 1965 as I did was acquainted with the music and lyrics of West Side Story from radio, records, and television and if you saved up for a Broadway seat.You might not have gotten Oklahoma, you might have thought Carousel was quaint and you sure thought South Pacific was for your parent's generation, but West Side Story spoke to you. It was about young people just trying to belong, if you will looking for a place, in time and space for us. And wonder of wonders not only could the American Musical Theater speak to you, but when your English teacher told you about the guy who wrote the story that this was based on, well maybe that guy who writes in incomprehensible English, that William Shakespeare guy, maybe he had some other relevant things to say. West Side Story promoted literacy and taste for a generation and you can't get a higher accolade than that.It's a difficult production also because it involves skill in acting, in dance, and you've got to have a great singing voice to deal with Leonard Bernstein's music and Stephen Sondheim's lyrics. They got a really great cast together on Broadway with Larry Kert, Carol Lawrence, Chita Rivera, and the rest. They all sang and danced and acted these Shakespearean based roles beautifully. Unfortunately there wasn't a movie name in the lot.Acting and dancing can't be faked on the silver screen, but singing can be dubbed as it was for leads Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood. A lot of Rita Moreno's songs were dubbed as well though that America number is all Rita. She'd actually done musicals before, The King and I and The Vagabond King remake are two of them. The voices of Jimmy Bryant and Marni Nixon fit them perfectly.West Side Story is pretty, witty, and bright and the witty part comes from two ensemble numbers Officer Krupke done by the Jets and America done by the Pyerto Rican Sharks. Listen very closely to the entertaining social commentary made by Stephen Sondheim. These numbers together with the accompanying Jerome Robbins choreography are some of the best examples of all the components of a successful musical working together.The ballads like Tonight, I Feel Pretty, A Place For Us, require almost opera like voices to sing them. I'd get either the Broadway cast album or the cast album for this film as a must for a recording collection. I happen to have a bootleg recording of Judy Garland and Vic Damone doing a selection from Garland's TV show. It is beautiful and priceless.One other thing about West Side Story that is endearing for me. Pay close attention to the role of Anybody's. It may be the first time that a transgender individual was portrayed in a major motion picture, let alone one that was the Best Picture of 1961. IMDb gives very little in the way of information about Susan Oakes the actress who played Anybody's. But her performance is nothing less than a harbinger of what Hilary Swank did as Brandon Teena in Boys Don't Cry.Like the kids from Romeo and Juliet and 16th century Verona, Italy, West Side Story is about young people just trying to find a place in time and space, finding a new way of living away from the dumb prejudices of their elders. They almost break free too.West Side Story won 10 Academy Awards including a joint Best Director Oscar for Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise, Best Supporting Actor and Supporting Actress for George Chakiris and Rita Moreno and a flock of technical awards. It set a standard for stage and screen to be both entertaining and contemporary.And it's so pretty, witty, and bright.",West Side Story
3,Leofwine_draca,Glorious musical,8,28 March 2014,"WEST SIDE STORY is everything a musical should be - epic, colourful, heartfelt and packed to the brim with rousing music, singing and dance numbers. Loosely based on ROMEO AND JULIET, this tells of the tragedy that arises when two people from opposite sides of the street fall in love.The story is brought to lively and vivid life by Robert Wise, one of the era's most reliable directors, and the transfer I watched makes it look absolutely stunning, with the huge street backdrops adding a really unique feel to the various choreographed numbers. Put simply, this is one of the most memorable musicals of all time because it stands alone in look and feel to all the rest.The cast are fine, typically better at the singing and dancing than they are at the acting, but then that's where it counts. Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer are the headliners with the romantic storyline, but I found the ethnic support from George Chakiris and Rita Moreno to be even stronger - and the energetic Russ Tamblyn, of course. In any case, there's nothing to dislike here; this is a classic for plenty of reasons, and all of them are good.",West Side Story
4,SnoopyStyle,Some great songs,7,19 September 2013,"West Side Story is Romeo and Juliet taking place in New York looking through the lens of Broadway. Two gangs, the white Jets led by Riff and the Puerto Rican Sharks led by Bernardo, are at war. When Riff's best friend Tony (Richard Beymer) and Bernardo's younger sister Maria (Natalie Wood) meet at a dance, they fall madly in love.Let's face it. These are the least scariest gangs on the face of the earth. These are Broadway hoodlums. However they have Natalie Wood, Rita Moreno, and a couple of great songs. That's enough to make this a good musical. It is however a big disappointment that Natalie Wood didn't sing her own songs. I have to subtract a point for that.",West Side Story
5,Hitchcoc,A True Musical,9,24 February 2006,"As the number of us who actually remember the types of gangs portrayed in this movie dwindle, it's easy to dismiss it as outdated--even humorous. What one needs to do, however, is consider it on its own merits--some of the most sophisticated music ever written for a musical (Leonard Bernstein). The choreography, gang posturing in your face rhythms, the dancing is breathtaking. Again, nothing is as dated as slang, but, as with Shakespeare, it was the language of the time. Those of you who find it amusing, take a look at current slang 20 years from now. Performances are pretty good although I'll never understand how Richard Beymer was selected for such a major role (his filmography is pretty limited) especially since they dubbed in his singing. Natalie Wood works OK but it's hard to imagine her a Puerto Rican. The Latins generally outperform the Anglos, but they probably have more to be angry about as characters. There is great tension in the music. When I first got a record of this I listened to it so often I could recite every word of every song. It's a fine musical. And, of course, there's ""Officer Krupke!""",West Side Story
6,mark.waltz,Excellent choice of changes from the Broadway production and great directing choices make this brilliant in every way.,10,21 October 2013,"Great theater can make you smile. Outstanding theater can make you weep, and in the case of ""West Side Story"", it isn't just the tragedy of the story but the way it is told through song and dance with Leonard Bernstein's music, Stephen Sondheim's lyrics and Jerome Robbins' choreography. Bring on Robert Wise to take on the dramatic sequences (sharing credit with Robbins) and you have a great start already. Casting choices for the leads aside, everything else meshes, turning into a film that 50 years later is sure to impress. A recent Broadway revival also managed to bring the Broadway show back to life, utilizing the changes of certain songs for mood and emotion, particularly switching the location of ""Gee Officer Krupke!"" and ""Cool"" to different acts than the original production to increase tension and bring the audience even deeper into the story.Also recently on Broadway, ""West Side Story's"" original source, ""Romeo and Juliet"", was altered to suit racial tensions, but while that was an important part of ""West Side Story's"" legacy, it was unnecessary for ""Romeo and Juliet"". Here, late 1950's/early 1960's Manhattan is utilized as the playground for two gangs of different backgrounds: the mainland born Jets and the Puerto Rican natives, the Sharks. Neither gang is devoid of sympathy and unlike ""Romeo and Juliet"", there is certainly no villain. Riff of ""The Jets"" is certainly decent, yet misguided, and all Bernardo of ""The Sharks"" wants is to be accepted into his new land and make a home with his sister Maria and girlfriend Anita. It is obvious by their manners that Bernardo and his pals probably tried to be cordial to the Jets but individual prejudices got in the way to prevent that. Even so, the Jets are products of their upbringing, and while the gang is obviously violent and the newcomers hot-tempered, neither one can be blamed other than what society had pushed them into becoming.Jerome Robbins' choreography is prevalent from the start, the opening airshot of Manhattan and surrounding eras pouring into the close-up of the gangs at war. The dance is masculine and exciting, and there is never any evidence of any of these men being any less than macho. Even the rumble later on is disturbingly choreographed, as is the post-rumble ""Cool!"" where the Jets prepare to go on after tragedy has struck. To lighten things up, Robbins has the fun but tense ""Dance at the Gym"" (hosted by none other than ""The Addams Family's"" John Astin!) and the hopeful ""America"", changed from the original all-female version to include the male Sharks as well.Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood have been riddled with attacks of miscasting, and I do agree that they are not the most magnetic of screen lovers. The heat, however, does come on when Rita Moreno (replacing Chita Rivera as Anita) and George Chakaris get together as Anita and Bernardo, and their chemistry is intense yet playful. During the ""Quintet"" reprise of ""Tonight!"" it is Moreno's preparation for Bernardo's arrival that reveals the sexual passion she feels and makes what happens even more tragic. Moreno and Chakaris deservedly won Academy Awards and years later, Moreno was deserving of even more praise when she comically spoofed her image as an untalented Latina singer in ""The Ritz"". I'm sure many a gay man jumped out of their seats in laughter when she guest starred on ""The Nanny"" and started a scene with Fran Drescher by saying ""A boy like that to kill your brother...""High praise, too, for Russ Tamblyn for his role of Riff. Having won screen immortality as ""Tom Thumb"", he is outstanding here as the very likable Jets gang member who seems at times torn over the hatred between the two groups yet unable to get away from it because of unmentioned pressures from his own pals. Each member of the gang stands out in one way or another, and when they have the rival gang dance, you can feel that there is a tension in these rebels without causes that even they can't understand.As the professional creative debut of Sondheim, he writes masterful lyrics even though as he states some of them don't sound like something a Puerto Rican girl would stay. (I'm referring to certain lyrics in ""West Side Story""). But take ""Tonight"", ""Something's Coming"", ""One Hand One Heart"", ""Somewhere"" and even certain lyrics of ""I Feel Pretty"", you have one of the all-time classic musical theater scores that did more to advance that genre of live entertainment than any other show of its era.",West Side Story
7,classicsoncall,"""Juvenile delinquency is purely a social disease"".",8,10 April 2011,"I always try to make a distinction between a film's critical acclaim and my own reaction to it. ""West Side Story"" is a much heralded film, and one of the Top 100 Movies of all time on the American Film Institute's original list from 1997. I'm not a big fan of musicals, so that probably plays a bit into my reaction to this picture. I just didn't care for the movie all that much, and really began to fidget the last hour or so, hitting the pause button repeatedly to see how much time was left till the end. The concept of rival gangs dancing and singing doesn't conform to a reality I've come to expect, and although this was an originally creative take on the Romeo and Juliet theme, I could just as easily have passed on it. My motivation in watching had all to do with the AFI Top 100 I mentioned earlier, as one of my goals on this board is to review every film on that list. For the most part, I'm in general agreement with the pervasive feeling accompanying most pictures, but occasionally I fall away from the pack, and this is one of those times.The one observation I would make though has more to do with the approach taken in presenting The Sharks. I have to wonder if this film would have been made today given the politically sensitive nature of the industry and many movie going fans. Other films are liberally criticized for being racist and fear mongering, and this one seems more overt than most if that's what you're looking for. It's no secret that the Jets hate the Sharks because they're Puerto Rican, and the song 'In America' expresses that sentiment. The interesting thing about it though, it's the Latino women who defend America as a land of opportunity, while their macho boyfriends see only futility and hatred at every turn. So for me, that was a clever little departure from the main story that had me thinking about how important attitude is in making a difference.The other thing that got my attention was the way Doc broke up the Jets' man-handling of Anita near the end of the story. With purposeful insight, this old shop keeper rightly questions the futility of the rumbling gangs - ""Why do you kids live like there's a war on""? With that, the picture offers some value for present generations in countries around the world who hold onto their own ideologies, instinctively choosing war over peace, and missing the chance to focus on the things that are really important, making the most of life for themselves and their communities.",West Side Story
8,gavin6942,"A Classic, But Hard to Watch Today",7,26 August 2012,"Musical about two youngsters from rival New York City gangs who fall in love.I understand this film won 10 Oscars, and I understand why. It truly deserved them. The opening dance scene ranks as one of the greatest scenes in move history and the choreography is almost unbelievable. Not to mention the film stars one of my favorite people, Russ Tamblyn (who I know from ""Twin Peaks"" but you might know as Gideon from ""Seven Brides For Seven Brothers"").I do feel the film does not hold up well today, though. It runs long, drags a lot, and many of the songs could be cut short or cut completely, adding nothing to character development or the plot. And the biggest mistake was casting Natalie Wood. I understand she added a known name to the picture, but she did not do her own singing, barely danced, and is obviously not Puerto Rican. I simply cannot understand who decided that the film would benefit from her inclusion.",West Side Story
9,lee_eisenberg,more than a musical,8,9 May 2005,"To call ""West Side Story"" a musical doesn't do justice to it. It represents a formidable achievement in cinema history.Based on ""Romeo and Juliet"", ""WSS"" tells the story of rival gangs in New York City's slums: the American Jets (I assume that they were ancestrally Italian, but they could have been Irish) and the Puerto Rican Sharks. Amid their constant fights, American handsome-boy Tony (Richard Beymer) and Puerto Rican beauty Maria (Natalie Wood) fall in love. Since their love is tacitly forbidden due to the hostility between their ethnic groups, Tony and Maria have to keep their relationship secret. But the continuous enmity between the gangs causes things to take a turn for the worst.The movie does have its flaws, mainly Natalie Wood's not-quite believable Puerto Rican accent. But overall, ""WSS"" is a great look not only at star-crossed love, but at the ethnic tension that exists even to this day.And there was that one woman in the movie who...I can't tell. Was she supposed to be a lesbian?",West Side Story
10,jboothmillard,West Side Story,9,17 March 2012,"From Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated directors Robert Wise (The Day the Earth Stood Still, The Sound of Music) and Jerome Robbins, I had heard about this highly popular musical from Stephen Sondheim (Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street), and I knew a couple of the songs from hearing them on talent shows, so I was really excited to watch it. Basically, set in 1957 in the streets on the West Side of Manhattan, New York, two rival teenage gangs are fighting over neighbourhood territories, these being the White American gang the Jets, and the Puerto Rican immigrant gang the Sharks. Riff Lorton (Russ Tamblyn) is the leader of the Jets, but one of the founding members of the gang Tony Wycek (Golden Globe nominated Richard Beymer) is no longer active with the others, but he still keeps in touch with them. Bernardo Nunez (Oscar and Golden Globe winning George Chakiris) is the leader of the Sharks, and he has his sister Maria (Natalie Wood) and girlfriend Anita (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Ria Moreno) who try to avoid getting involved in the gang situations. It is at a dance that Tony and Maria meet each other, and it is love at first sight, this would of course cause even stronger hatred between the gangs. Anita supports Maria's decision to go against her brother and continue seeing Tony when they have the opportunities, Maria even tries suggesting that Tony should try and make peace between the Jets and the Sharks. Of course this attempt to end the feud between the two gangs only creates a massive argument between Riff and Bernardo, Riff is killed by Bernardo, and Tony is shocked to have killed Bernardo in the heat of the moment. One of the Sharks angrily tells Maria what has happened to her brother, and she does at first act angry towards Tony, but he explains what happened and he promises her that they will be able to live happily if they move away. While the Jets plan to get revenge for the death of Riff, Anita at first tries to convince Maria that a man that kills another is bad, but she is convinced that they truly love each other, and she tells her that Chino Martin (Jose DeVega) is looking for Tony with a gun. After Maria covers up for Tony about his involvement with Bernando's death to Lieutenant Schrank (Simon Oakland), Anita goes to tell Tony that his true love is detained, but she is harassed and mock raped by the Jets, until Doc (Ned Glass) comes in, and she instead angrily tells them that Maria is dead. After being told this lie that she was shot dead by Chino, Tony runs out and shouts for him, but he is happily shocked to see Maria coming towards him, and then the Jets and the Sharks show up after Tony is fatally wounded by gun shot by Chino. Tony tragically dies in Maria's arms, she angrily shouts and blames the rivalry between the Jets and the Sharks, even threatening to kill some of them and herself, but she can't do it, and in the end Tony's body is taken away, Maria walks behind him, and everyone else walks away as well. Also starring Tucker Smith as Ice, Tony Mordente as Action, William 'Bill' Bramley as Krupke, Eliot Feld as Baby John and Susan Oakes as Anybodys. Beymer gives a good performance as the young man yearning for the sister of the rival gang leader, Wood is beautiful and touching as the young woman stuck in between the battle, Chakiris with his time on screen is good being aggressive and good looking, and Moreno is terrific as the girlfriend of the gang leader who is obviously a dangerous choice. The Romeo and Juliet inspired story is compelling, the colourful settings and costumes are sensational, the choreography for the dancing and dance style fights are terrific, and the songs, many that I recognised, including ""Maria"" (which I heard sung on Britain's Got Talent), ""Tonight"" (number 61 on 100 Years, 100 Songs), ""America"" (number 35 on 100 Years, 100 Songs), ""I Feel Pretty"" and ""Somewhere"" (number 20 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, which I heard the music of on Britain's Got Talent) are fantastic, it is a wonderful musical romantic drama. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Saul Chaplin, Johnny Green, Sid Ramin and Irwin Kostal, Best Sound and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Musical. It was number 41 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 4 on The 100 Greatest Musicals. Very good!",West Side Story
11,moonspinner55,"Big and flashy, but also heavy and tiresome...",6,18 March 2006,"Audiences flocked to see this handsome screen-adaptation of the popular Broadway musical show about juvenile delinquents in New York City, battling each other for prominence on Manhattan's West Side. So many different, top-rank talents were involved in this production that it's really no surprise the end result seems awfully heavy, weighed down by unnecessary self-importance and a creaky ""Romeo and Juliet""-styled plot that was a wheeze even in 1961. Two teenagers from disparate sides fall in love, but Natalie Wood is entirely inappropriate as a barrios Cinderella (she's encumbered by the heavy pancake make-up, the plastic conviction laid upon her character and the drowsy overdubbing/lip-syncing process on the musical numbers). The thin premise is belittled further by the presentation, so big and ""new"" and ""bold"" that it forgets to have a personal connection (between the characters on-screen and the audience). Still, it won 10 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (the overrated Robert Wise), Best Supporting Actor (the inert George Chakiris), Best Supporting Actress (Rita Moreno, who shows real spirit), and Best Cinematography (courtesy Daniel Fapp, and deservedly so, for his opening shots are still being copied). ** from ****",West Side Story

The film beat out the great ""Judgment at Nuremberg.""Jerome Robbins' choreography can't be beat. Lenny Bernstein's music is just phenomenal. You know from it that the Jets and Sharks think they own the neighborhood. They can certainly make life difficult in the neighborhood. Just keep them singing and dancing and everything could be fine.Unfortunately, this is really a musical version of Romeo and Juliet with gang warfare. In the Shakespearian classic, we had to contend with family feuds.It's the same old story of oppressed people calling out for help in America. Everyone wants a good piece of the action, to secure the American dream. Unfortunately, the Jets and Sharks, two neighborhood street gangs are in need of desperate psychiatric help. Their answer to everything is singing, dancing and using the knife.Poor Simon Oakland. As officer Krupke, he comes off as the tough uncaring police chief who is ready to bust heads.Natalie Wood is wonderful as Maria but too bad that the usual reliable Marnie Nixon had to sing for her. Why wasn't Carol Lawrence from Broadway allowed to do the movie?George Chakiris (Bernardo) won the best supporting actor award as did Rita Moreno for best supporting actress. Why this occurred is beyond me. Many people are not aware that Chakiris and Moreno did not do their own singing in the film. Besides, Montgomery Clift and Judy Garland were magnificent in ""Judgment at Nuremberg."" They were literally robbed of the coveted award.Why does Rita have to sing to Maria that a boy like that, he killed your brother? You don't keep going with a guy you just did that. If someone has to explain that to you, you've got trouble.If we can go beyond the oppression and need for understanding and just enjoy the singing and dancing, you're in for a treat.Russ Tamblyn dances like he owns the streets of N.Y.

14,wes-connors,Jumping the Sharks and Jets,9,2 September 2011,"In pure form, as it is set among culture clashing working class youth in New York City, ""West Side Story"" is one of the greatest American musicals. Less discussed, it also captured the beat (or rock) revolution happening simultaneously (the original 1950s Broadway show), thanks to a score by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim alongside choreography by Jerome Robbins that transcends genre by creatively blending the traditional and revolutionary. Decades later, musicians continue to swipe or acknowledge the show in some fashion, with Michael Jackson's ""Beat It"" and ""Bad"" perhaps the most famous examples.Alas, a ten is not always perfect...First of all, there is nothing wrong with casting outside of ethnicity - if Sandra Dee were convincing in the part, she should allowed to play the Puerto Rican teenage heroine. As the big-name, highly paid ""star"" of the movie, Natalie Wood (as Maria) is the easiest casting target. She essays the role acceptably, but not exceptionally. For something of this magnitude, something significantly more than acceptable is needed. It also hurts that Ms. Wood looks more like Richard ""Tony"" Beymer's sister than lover...Marni Nixon and Jimmy Bryant make beautiful music together.The more believable relationship is between Rita Moreno (as Anita) and George Chakiris (as Bernardo). And the real emotional dynamic is always between the ""Shark"" and ""Jet"" leaders - Mr. Chakiris, Russ Tamblyn (as Riff) and, later, Tucker Smith (as Ice). Consequently, the film's dramatic peak is the final scene between ""Bernardo"" and ""Riff"" rather than the one between ""Maria"" and ""Tony"". Watch the smaller characters ""Anybodys"" and ""Doc"" for great subtext. Moving the story close enough for opera, every production number is a highlight.

It stars Natalie Wood, Richard Beymer, Russ Tamblyn, Rita Moreno, George Chakiris and David Winters.The movie is an adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name that was adapted from William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet.West Side Story opens with an overhead shot of Manhattan that introduced to two rival street gangs: the Jets, second-generation American teens, and the Sharks, Puerto Rican immigrants. When the war between the Jets and Sharks reaches a fever pitch, Jets leader Riff decides to challenge the Sharks to one last ""winner take all"" rumble. He decides to meet Sharks leader Bernardo for a war council at a gymnasium dance; to bolster his argument, Riff wants his old pal Tony, the co-founder of the Jets, to come along. But Tony has set his sights on vistas beyond the neighborhood and has fallen in love with Bernardo's sister, Maria, a love that, as in Romeo and Juliet, will eventually end in tragedy. All the songs written by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim for the original Broadway production of West Side Story were retained for the film version which makes this musical truly a classic.It also retains the original choreography of Jerome Robbins, which is recreated in some of the most startling and balletic dance sequences ever recorded on cinema.Finally,the performances of the cast were just simply terrific that one cannot find a reason not to enjoy this movie.West Side Story is a beautifully-mounted, impressive, emotion-ridden and violent musical which, in its stark approach to a raging social problem and realism reflected during its time of release.The 10 Academy Awards it has won truly attests to how great this movie is.Truly,it was a landmark musical for many years to come.",West Side Story

Set in the 50s in a steamy gangland New York, pic unfurls in a blaze of booming colour and scintillating choreography (Robbins). It has very much become a film that musical lovers can rejoice in, for even though it has problems, when it soars it soars far and away.Problems come with the crossed gang lovers played by Wood and Beymer, the actors dubbing is poor, their dialogue delivery also itchy. It doesn't help that the film's quality noticeably dips when this fall in love axis of the story (as key as it is) shows up - stretching the run time to a nearly unbearable and unjustified length.Yet it remains a joyous experience even today, you can forgive it for its ills when you get songs like ""America"" (Moreno the best thing in the film by far) that transport you up there on the screen.

It was (partially) shot on location in NYC which helps and is full of color and life.Unfortunately there are problems here: Natalie Wood hated Richard Beymer--and it comes through loud and clear. There's a unbelievable lack of sexual chemistry between them and Wood gives a rare bad performance. Beymer is tall, handsome, muscular--and a total blank as Tony. The poor guy is trying but Wood's attitude obviously bothered him. Still everything else about the movie is great. I have a few minor quibbles: How did Tony know where Maria's apartment was?; ""I Feel Pretty"" is actually hilarious--check out Wood's ""dancing""; the ""Cool"" number is great to look at but brings the movie to a screeching halt.But everything else works. Chakiris and Rita Moreno are just fantastic as Bernardo and Anita--their dancing and acting is just perfect--they richly deserved those Academy Awards they won. Russ Tamblyn is also very good as Riff (leader of the Jets) and shows some incredible dance moves. And look for John Astin in a hilarious bit at the dance.All the dances and numbers are good and the lip syncing is pulled off by Beymer and Wood pretty well. But the show stopper is ""America""--that number comes right out of the screen at you full force. The lyrics are sanitized from the Broadway show but who cares? It still works.This won 10 Academy Awards--including Best Picture and Best Director(s). A true classic musical. I've seen it tons of times and I never get tired of it. A must-see. I give it a 10 all the way.",West Side Story
19,CinemaSerf,The Bard would approve...,8,17 August 2020,"Rarely can Shakespeare ever have been transferred so successfully as with this fantastic, liberal, adaptation of ""Romeo & Juliet"" from an inspired Jerome Robbins and Ernest Lehman. Set amongst a tense environment of feuding between the Jets - led by ""Riff"" (Russ Tamblyn) and the Sharks - led by ""Bernardo"" (George Chakiris) - implacable foes who trespass on the turf of the other at their peril. When ""Tony"" (Richard Beymer) - a lapsed Jet and best pal of Tamblyn falls for ""Maria"" (Natalie Wood), the sister of arch-enemy ""Bernardo"" the storm clouds start to gather. The hot and sultry 1950s New York setting is electrifying, the characterisations thoroughly engaging. The magnificent Bernstein score and, in my view, Stephen Sondheim's best lyric create a melting pot of hate, loathing, mistrust and violence tempered with love - and mischief, all deftly demonstrated via the medium of dance. Chakiris, Tamblyn and Wood are superb - as is Rita Moreno (""Anita"") and poor old ""Officer Krupke"" (William Bramley); and the choreography has a fluidity and style that's never since been replicated. It pulls at the heart strings, the emotions palpable - and the ending does great justice to the original drama. If you haven't seen this, then you must. if you have, then find it on a big screen and just let go!",West Side Story
20,grantss,"Dull, and a classic example of why I generally dislike musicals",4,30 January 2017,"New York, 1950s. Maria (Natalie Wood) and Tony (Richard Beymer) are two youngsters in two rival gangs, the Sharks and Jets, respectively. They meet and fall in love. This will have fateful consequences.Dull. I dislike musicals (though there are exceptions, Chicago and The Sound of Music being among them) and West Side Story is a great example of why. The overly theatrical acting, random musical detours, campy music and acting, style instead of substance, musical interludes instead of a good plot. Here the music actually detracts from the plot, as it is hard to imagine these being tough gang members when they are constantly singing and flamboyantly dancing around! Watch or read the real deal, Romeo and Juliet, instead. To call this an adaptation of Romeo and Juliet does Shakespeare a massive injustice.",West Side Story
21,Boba_Fett1138,A modern Romeo and Juliet.,8,11 April 2011,"Reason why I like this movie is foremost because it forms a sort of transition between the old fashioned musical of the '30's and 40's mostly and the more modern ones, that we also still know and see these days. This movie is from a time that the genre wasn't that popular anymore and not a whole lot of musical movies got made during the '50's and '60's. After the acclaimed success of this movie there was a small revival again and this movie pretty much set the standard for the more 'modern' movie musical.This is a real musical alright. The movie doesn't ever pretend to be a 'real' movie, which means that the movie is going for a totally theatrical approach instead of realistic cinematic one. The entire movie basically consists out of singing and dancing, so also the acting is something totally different from what you would normally see in a normal movie, that is still trying to be somewhat more straight-forward and serious with its story and drama. Also the entire movie obviously looks like it got shot on a large stage, as opposed to outside in a real city. It's all done very deliberately and I must say I liked this approach to the genre.This was the first musical movie Robert Wise directed and only 4 years later he made his second musical movie, ""The Sound of Music"", which perhaps is even better known than this movie already is. Thing I'm always amazed by with Robert Wise movies is that he often picks a genre and then does something totally new and original with it. He did this with science-fiction and horror for instance and with musicals with this movie. He was still being helped though this time by choreographer Jerome Robbins, who co-directed. It earned them both the Oscar for best director and the movie itself won 9 more Oscars, including best picture.And this really is one fine directed movie. Not just with its choreography and all but also really visually. It has a great style over it and the movie is picking some really fine artistic approaches, visually, at times. It's visually less impressive though how the Puerto Rican look like people who had fallen asleep while trying to get a tan. No, the make-up just isn't very good or convincing looking. Even the fake accent often convince more than it.The story that it follows is basically like a modern update of the Romeo and Juliet story by William Shakespeare, though mostly only just with its main concept. The movie still uses plenty of story of its own and comes up with plenty of stuff to still consider the story good and original on its own. But because the movie is not being realistic in any way, the drama of the story also falls sort of short in my opinion, as does the overall message behind it.The movie also features some real classic songs, that I'm sure you've heard before. Not all songs are great but for a movie that features so many songs, that is also virtually impossible. Most of the actors are obviously at home within the genre and know how to sing and dance. The two main leads though are being played by film actors Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer, who's singing also got dubbed.A first great step into the direction of 'modern' movie musicals.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",West Side Story

23,neil-476,"Very good, but...",7,7 June 2011,"West Side Story is a film I appreciate rather than like.Yes, it is loosely based on Shakespeare. OK, but big deal. Yes, it is an artistic leap forward in transplanting modern dance into an urban setting with a romantic context. I'll grant you that, but I don't much care for the dancing (I don't much care for dancing anyway). This is the stuff I'm lukewarm about.Here is stuff I actively am not too keen on. I don't like juxtaposing urban realism and stylisation in terms of sets. There are some performances which varied from ""mannered"" (not a compliment) to what one might class as appropriate to the time the film was made: the urban realism doesn't always stretch to the performances. And the two principals were, in my view, a bit on the weak side.Now we come to what I liked.The score. Oh, that fabulous, fabulous score! If this film existed as nothing other than a vehicle for Bernstein's score and Sondheim's libretto, then that would be good enough. These are, quite simply the best songs (words and music), as an collection of pieces, ever written for musical theatre or film.",West Side Story
24,evanston_dad,Romeo and Juliet: The Musical,9,23 October 2006,"This film version of the classic Broadway musical is hopelessly dated, but that's more a testament to how timely the material was than it is a criticism. Of course the image of gang violence portrayed here comes across as unbelievably quaint now, but compare this film musical to any other film musical of the time to see how gritty and different it probably seemed to audiences.Natalie Wood (pretty, but not a great actress) and Richard Beymer (terribly miscast) make no impression as young lovers Tony and Maria, but Rita Moreno, George Chakiris and Russ Tamblyn more than make up for any spark the leads fail to generate. Jerome Robbins' choreography remains intact and looks terrific on screen, and the score by Leonard Bernstein may be the best ever composed for the musical theatre.I really like the look of this picture. The off-kilter camera angles and stylized production design generate the feeling that everything is transpiring in a feverish dream world and retain the artificial feel of an imaginary world, while Wise's fluid direction and use of actual New York exteriors at the same time open up the movie and give it a distinctly cinematic feel. Wise had a knack for adapting stage musicals that other film directors sorely lacked.Grade: A",West Side Story
25,Uriah43,An Outstanding Musical,8,5 April 2020,"Based on a Broadway play by the same name and inspired by William Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"", this film involves two rival gangs fighting for territory in one particular area of New York City. The first gang, known as the Jets and led by a young man named ""Riff"" (Russ Tamblyn) are essentially white Americans from various European ancestry. The Sharks, on the other hand, are immigrants from Puerto Rico and feel discriminated against by everyone else in that particular neighborhood-especially the Jets. Eventually, the tension between the two bubbles over when one of the Jets is attacked which leads to a conference at a neutral site between Riff and the leader of the Sharks, ""Bernardo"" (George Chakiris) to discuss a winner-take-all battle between the two sides. By coincidence, since the conference is being held at a local dance hall, it's there that Bernardo's younger sister ""Maria"" (Natalie Wood) meets and falls in love with a former member of the Jets by the name of ""Tony"" (Richard Beymer) who is almost idolized by Riff. Needless to say, Bernardo becomes outraged when he sees Tony and Maria together and things become even more heated for all concerned after that. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an outstanding musical which benefited greatly from the Academy Award winning acting of Rita Moreno (as Bernardo's girlfriend ""Anita"") and the aforementioned George Chakiris. It also won the Academy Award for ""Best Picture"" along with numerous other awards and nominations as well. Likewise, the musical score was also impressive with songs like ""Maria"", ""Tonight"", ""America"" and ""Somewhere"" particularly standing out in my opinion. In any case, I recommend this film for those who enjoy romantic musicals of this type and have rated it accordingly.",West Side Story
26,morrison-dylan-fan,Gangs of New York.,8,22 December 2015,"With Christmas coming up,I started to keep a look out for any films which my dad mentioned he was interested in seeing.Whilst watching a clip show on TV,I was surprised to discover that my dad did not have West Side Story on DVD,which led to me deciding that this X-Mas it was time to step into the west side.The plot:Wanting to expand on their turfs,gangs the Jets and the Sharks fight against each other in a ground war.Ignoring the half-hearted attempts by the cops to stop them fighting,the gangs start to attack each other in an increasingly deadly manner. Traditionally staying apart on the dance floor,Jet member Tony catches a glimpse of rival Shark Maria and falls in love with her at first sight.Spotting Tony,Maria soon finds herself falling in love with him,which leads to Maria and Tony having to go to war with their own gangs. View on the film:Opening with the Jets and the Sharks diving across the stage,directors Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins (who got sacked over being a ""perfectionist"" for the dance scenes,which led to filming being delayed and the movie going over budget)treat both gangs in a lavish manner,as ravishing ruby reds and fading blues come between the star-crossed lovers,with Wise & Robbins heating up the feud between the gangs with an extreme stylisation,as flashes of blood reds are cast against the troubled gang members.Along with the dazzling appearance,Wise & Robbins present the dance scenes with a dashing elegance,thanks to firmly held wide shots allowing the viewer to catch every rapid-fire dance move.Whilst having to make changes to the script to please the ratings board, Ernest Lehman adaptation is still able to offer street smart songs and rosy melodrama.Keeping Tony and Maria separated by the gangs,Lehman does very well at building anticipation for the lovers to join together,which Lehman than brilliantly breaks into a million pieces.Featuring references to rape and drugs,Lehman does not shy away from painting the gangs/lovers in a negative light,as each side stokes up tensions and introduce new elements (such as knives and guns) into their turf war.Although he was far from happy with his performance, (and did not get on with his leading lady) Richard Beymer still gives a very good performance as Tony,who Beymer shows is unable to fully sand down the gang edges he has for his first love. Joined by a wonderful Rita Moreno, (who decades later starred in the stunning HBO series OZ) Natalie Wood sadly never appears fully comfortable as the Latino Maria,with Wood being very fond of overusing ""big hand"" gestures.Keeping the tension between them off screen,Wood strikes the blossoming romance with a passionate note,with Wood filling Maria's eyes with love and sorrow,as Tony & Maria's romance ends on the west side.",West Side Story

The movie is at its best when no one is singing or dancing, but this is coming from someone who doesn't like those things in his movie.

28,gradyharp,"'Well now I can kill, too, because now I have hate!'",10,16 December 2018,"As much a part of American musical history as any other work, WEST SIDE STORY moved very comfortable from the 1957 Broadway stage to this 1961 cinematic version of Leonard Bernstein's immortal masterwork for the stage. Though there are still issues of the original Broadway cast recording (Carol Lawrence, Larry Kirk, George Chakiris, et al) this DVD includes the actual film complete with a perfectly presented overture and entr'acte and the tuning performance by a cast of fine dancers an actors. Ernest Lehman transitioned the play into a movie based on Arthur Laurents' book in turn based on Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and the choreography and direction is by Jerome Robbins with Robert Wise.Very briefly, West Side Story is the adaptation of ""Romeo and Juliet"". The feuding families become two warring New York City gangs- the white Jets led by Riff (Russ Tamblyn) and the Puerto Rican Sharks, led by Bernardo (George Chakiris). Their hatred escalates to a point where neither can coexist with any form of understanding. But when Riff's best friend (and former Jet) Tony (Richard Beymer) and Bernardo's younger sister Maria (Natalie Wood) meet at a dance, no one can do anything to stop their love. Maria and Tony begin meeting in secret, planning to run away. Then the Sharks and Jets plan a rumble under the highway - whoever wins gains control of the streets. Maria sends Tony to stop it, hoping it can end the violence. It goes terribly wrong, and before the lovers know what's happened, tragedy strikes and doesn't stop until the climactic and heartbreaking ending.One important 'character' is the voice of Marni Nixon who provided Natalie Woods' singing: sadly Marni, known for so many offstage vocals, died in 2016 - one of the finest singing actresses and backup voices for famous actors the ever lived.The choreography, photography, set design, and dancing and acting is first class.

30,JamesHitchcock,One of the Great Musicals,9,30 June 2005,"There have been numerous films, from ""Broken Arrow"" to ""Snow Falling on Cedars"", which have made use of the Romeo and Juliet theme of two lovers from opposite sides of a divided community. ""West Side Story"", however, does not just borrow Shakespeare's basic theme but also follows the outlines of his plot, while turning it into a musical and updating it to the New York of the fifties. The Montagues and the Capulets become two rival street gangs, the Jets (white) and the Sharks (Puerto Rican). The two young lovers are Tony, one of the Jets, and Maria, the sister of the Sharks' leader Bernardo. Apart from the lovers' parents, most of Shakespeare's main characters have their equivalents in the film. Bernardo is Tybalt, Riff (Tony's close friend and the leader of the Jets) Mercutio and Tony's elderly employer Doc Friar Lawrence. Maria's older confidante Anita has some of the characteristics of Juliet's Nurse, but she has another role as Bernardo's girlfriend. Many of the important scenes from the play also have their equivalents; thus the dance in the gym parallels the Capulets' ball, the scene on the fire escape the balcony scene, and so on. ""West Side Story"" is not simply a musical; it also deals with two important social issues, racism and juvenile delinquency. The two issues are, in this context, seen to be connected. The influx of Hispanic immigrants into New York at this period led to friction between them and the established population, even though many of that population were themselves of recent immigrant stock. Many of the Puerto Rican characters complain of having met with prejudice and discrimination, which reinforces their own prejudices against white Americans. Bernardo resents being referred to as a ""Spick"", but he has no compunction about referring to the Polish-American Tony by the equally derogatory term ""Polack"". The witty number ""Gee Officer Krupke"" humorously satirises fashionable psychological and sociological theories about the causes of delinquency, but the film also puts forward a theory of its own. Membership of the racially exclusive youth gangs is portrayed as being a means of strengthening one's sense of racial identity as well as one's sense of one's own importance. The Jets' slogan ""Little boy, you're a man; little man, you're a king"" has been described as encapsulating in one line the seductive appeal of fascist ideology. When the two gangs clash, they are not motivated merely by youthful aggression but also see themselves as defending the honour of their respective communities. The film is therefore both a tragic love-story and a piece of social commentary. This dual nature is reflected both in the look of the film and in its music. The songs fall into two categories. Those dealing with the love of Tony and Maria are generally traditional melodic ballads such as ""Tonight"" and ""A Place for Us"". There are also, however, a number of songs which comment on social issues, and these, such as ""Gee Officer Krupke"", ""America"" or ""The Jets Song"" are harder-edged, characterised by more modernistic harmonies and rhythms and witty or sardonic lyrics. Besides two distinct styles of music, the film also makes use of two distinct palettes. The more tender scenes between Tony and Maria are mostly shot against a dark background relieved by pale whites and yellows. In those scenes dealing with tragedy, violence or strong emotions, (such as the dance at the gym or the ""rumble"") hotter colours, particularly reds, predominate. When, after Bernardo's death, Tony and Maria sing ""There's a place for us"", the red light in the background casts an ominous shadow over their love, at odds with the optimistic words they are singing. In the tragic final scene Maria, previously seen in white or yellow, wears a red dress for the first time. This final scene is the only occasion on which the plot of the film diverges markedly from Shakespeare's. This was presumably done in order to increase the dramatic tension. Like Romeo, Tony wrongly believes that the woman he loves is dead. At this point those viewers familiar with Shakespeare will probably assume, as I did, that the film will end with Tony committing suicide in despair and Maria following him. Then Tony sees Maria, realises his error, and for a brief instant we hope that a happy ending is after all possible, only for these hopes to be dashed almost immediately. This brief revival of hope does, however, add to the emotional power of the ending. I felt that the two leading roles could have been better. Richard Beymer makes Tony too bland, the sort of young man who would be more at home in the Boy Scouts than in a gang of street fighters. There was nothing particularly wrong with Natalie Wood's Maria except that she seemed rather one-dimensional, charming and sweetly innocent but lacking depth. I found myself regretting that Audrey Hepburn (the producers' first choice for the role) had not been available. Despite that reservation, however, this is one of the great film musicals. Leonard Bernstein's score is brilliant and the song lyrics are both witty and pertinent, often driving home the film's points as well as, or better than, the spoken dialogue. The ensemble dance numbers are the most powerful and energetic of those in any musical that I have seen, with the possible exception of ""Seven Brides for Seven Brothers"". Although there had been a growing trend in the fifties to use the musical as a vehicle for more than just lighthearted amusement, ""West Side Story"" was the film that, more than any other, showed that it was possible to use the genre to combine entertainment with social comment. The contrast between this film and Bernstein's previous film musical, the fluffy ""On the Town"", shows how much the genre had developed in only twelve years. 9/10",West Side Story
31,Smells_Like_Cheese,Perfection on film,10,26 October 2002,"West Side Story, one of my personal favorite movies of all time and without a doubt my favorite musical. Why do I love this film so much? Because of it's high energy, great actors, terrific songs, awesome dance numbers, and beautiful love story. As an updated Romeo and Juliet story, we visit the streets of Manhattan, two gangs of different ethnicities, Tony and Maria, the two fall in love by are torn apart by the gang's hatred for each other. Sounds pretty basic, not to mention we have dancing gangs, they don't really fight, they just dance, yeah again sissy, but not in this story! The crew and cast put their heart and soul into this film and it truly paid off as this is the best picture of 1961.In the streets of Manhattan the Jets, led by Riff, and a rival gang of Puerto Rican immigrants, the Sharks, led by Bernardo begin to rumble. The police arrive and tell the ""hoodlums"" to get off the streets. The Jets discuss challenging the Sharks to one last all out ""rumble"", that will decide who gets control of the streets, and they will deliver the challenge to the Sharks at a dance later that night. Riff decides that his best friend Tony, a co-founder of the Jets who has left the gang to work at a local store, would be the best member of the Jets to present the challenge to the Sharks. When Riff visits Tony at the store, Tony initially refuses Riff's request to meet with the Sharks, but he later changes his mind. At the bridal shop where she works, Bernardo's sister, Maria complains to Bernardo's girlfriend, Anita. Maria believes that Bernardo is overprotective, never allowing her to have enough fun. Bernardo arrives and takes her to the dance. At the gym, the Jets, Sharks and girls are greatly enjoying themselves, but the rival gang members and their girlfriends remain apart. Tony and Maria see each other, become infatuated, almost going into a trance-like state and begin to dance, then embrace in a kiss. Bernardo pushes them away from each other and orders Maria home, and tells Tony to stay away from his sister.Tony discreetly visits Maria outside the fire escape at her home and they confirm their love. The next day at the bridal shop, Maria sings to her coworkers about how happy she is. Tony arrives to see Maria, she pleads with Tony to prevent the rumble altogether, even if only a fist fight is planned, and Tony promises to do so. At the the rumble, the fight begins between two rival gang members. Tony arrives and tries to stop the fight, but is met with ridicule and mockery from Bernardo and the Sharks. Unable to stand by and watch his best friend be humiliated, Riff angrily lashes out and punches Bernardo. Drawing their knives, Riff and Bernardo fight each other, their duel ending with Bernardo killing Riff. Enraged, Tony kills Bernardo with Riff's knife! Tensions are now at an all time high as both gangs want to get even and Tony and Maria's love is being torn apart by all the hate.West Side Story is truly a special movie, I personally don't know why it's not on the top 250 IMDb movies, if you are going to watch a musical this is the one that I always recommend. We don't get musicals to this big scape any more, they don't have the same heart as West Side Story had. The actors are absolutely incredible, it's so weird when I watched a documentary on this movie, apparently Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer hated each other, but I guess that must help during the lust scenes because hate and love are practically in the same category when it comes to passion. But the true stars of the film are Rita Moreno as Anita and Russ Tamblyn as Riff, great performances from the both of them. West Side Story is a movie that has no flaws what so ever and anyone who wants to argue me on that, feel free to send me a message.10/10",West Side Story

The film call it a musical is helped along by it's score, songs, and dance moves much of it done with much grace and wonder. Set in New York city the background and scenes really get the viewer in the mood for drama and love.The acting and cast is super as the chemistry is unmatched Natalie Wood is innocent and loving as Maria who finds love only to have it end in a tragic way, and Rita Moreno is spot on as Anita as both brush up with culture clashes. The film is an emotional and give and tug conflict between the rival Jets and Sharks as it's themes of love, tragedy, and tolerance is so strongly felt.

33,lasttimeisaw,Musical at its high time!,8,3 May 2014,"Open a time capsule and watch this 10-Oscar winner in 1961 (including BEST PICTURE), a Rome- and-Juliet inspired musical adaption (originally a Broadway play by Leonard Bernstein) under the milieu of the turf war between two youth gangs, The Sharks (Puerto Rican immigrants) vs. The Jets (local white trashes) in NYC, Maria (Wood) is the younger sister of The Sharks' leader Bernardo (Chakiris), she and Tony (Beymer) are drawn to each other from the very first sight in a dancing room, but Tony is the best of Riff (Tamblyn), the head of The Jets gang. In a single- combat by which two rivalries want to settle all the scores once and for all, Maria asks Tony to stop the rumble but the enmity cannot be quenched and Tony's interference only makes things worse, there will be blood shedding and the hostility widens. It's Romeo and Juliet, so don't expect there will be a happy ending.What is more striking is that WEST SIDE STORIES is a paragon of blending top-notch choreography and singing renditions with the heightened tension in its narrative, compared with HELLO, DOLLY! (1969, 7/10), it is a much more potent film, in a sense that its impact is not purely from the synchronised visual stunt or mellifluous voices, it is a film at the very first place, musical is the form to amplify the emotion of the story, that's why it excels HELLO, DOLLY! in my opinion, the latter is an extravagant party with well-crafted entertainment. In WEST SIDE STORIES, its soundtrack is one of the best successful album in USA for all-time, while going with the test of time, it is dulcet, catchy but also a tad behind the times for the ears of our generation. But the difference between the live play and the film version is they can dub the voice for the latter, Natalie Wood doesn't need to be trained as a soprano, and it hardly affect one's attention to empathy her rejoicing or grief with well-calculated lip-synching. Both Tony and Maria are presented in a conventional way that unfortunately cramps Beymer and Wood's performances, only in the final act, Wood finally gets the chance to unleash her glistening rage and grab the limelight, hones up the dramatic climax with her final roar and condemnation. Indeed it is Chakiris and Moreno (plays Anita, Bernardo's wife) who won two Oscars and it was a rare achievement for non-white actors to win acting statues at then, Chakiris is a slick dancer and competent singer himself, it is more like a trophy for his personal allure and showmanship than his acting skill, which would be repeated by Joel Grey in CABARET (1972, 9/10). Moreno is the one who really rides both the choreography and the hard-bitten drama here, her Latin-gene gifts her fiery passion and she is the first one willing to accept Maria and Tony's love story, and she is not driven by pure hatred even after the ensuing tragedy blindsides her life, her ideals are to bury the hatchet and discard all the animosity because American belongs to everyone, not one racial, but every and each citizen. In the most intense scenes when Anita encounters the Jets in Doc's store, during the violent gang-rape stimulating dance number, she embodies not as a screeching victim, but a stern warrior, she contends with piercing resolution to thaw the deep cleavage rooted in those hoodlums' mindset, at least she has tried. This is a worthy victory for her. WEST SIDE STORY is a one-of-a-kind gem of its genre, directors Jerome Robbins (who was fired owing to that his multiple shooting of every scene was be too pricey for its budget) and Robert Wise (substituted Robbins in the director chair and who would bring us another musical classic THE SOUND OF MUSIC 1965, 8/10) do make wonders and concoct this movie-and-Broadway hybrid with an almost peerless upshot, a marvellous achievement in spite of the thorny multitasking of acting and entertaining.",West Side Story

The 50's had seen the rise of big, bluff country-style musicals starring the likes of Gordon Macrae and Howard Keel as well as the final efforts of Golden Age maestros Astaire and Kelly, but ""West Side Story"" was different. It started what would be a tumultuous decade for music in general and the visual arts in particular, it celebrated youth, confronted today's societal problems such as racial integration, gang warfare and the generation gap, was part-filmed on location and above all took songwriting and choreography to new heights.Surprisingly, it made only one real lasting star from its large cast, Natalie Wood as Maria although arguably there is a claim for the sasssy Rita Moreno too.The movie, adapted from the original stage musical, cleverly and imaginatively updates Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"" which as everyone surely knows, means it will inevitably end in tears. This perhaps gives the film a downbeat conclusion at odds with the drama and urgency of what's gone before, but of course, in so doing, gets over the message that violence begets violence as well as that carrying knives and guns around is just asking for trouble.I loved the exuberance of the cast and their collective sheer agility and physicality. Sure, the sometimes cringeworthy hep-cat daddy-o dialogue dates it somewhat, but the colour and vibrancy of the direction, with some wonderful panning shots keeps the viewer interested from first to last, while there can surely be no better evocation of love at first sight than the classic isolation shot when Tony and Maria first set eyes on each other.But above all, it's about the songs. Great song after great song, they just keep on coming, like New York subway trains. What a perfect match of glorious melody and insightful lyrics from Bernstein and Sondheim. My own favourite of them all has to be ""America"" with its underlying social comment, but ""Maria"" will melt your heart, then there's ""Somewhere"", ""Something's Coming"", ""Tonight"" and more.If I was carping, I could possibly contend that the movie doesn't quite break the shackles of its theatrical roots but in almost every other respect, I consider it a triumph. The stars truly did align for this one.",West Side Story
36,ElMaruecan82,Musical Tagging on Old Hollywood Walls...,9,29 May 2016,"""West Side Story"" is unanimously regarded as one of the all-time greatest cinematic romances yet when we think of Tony and Maria, there isn't much imagery to come to mind, except for the Cinderella-like thunderbolt and the Shakespearian conclusion. Apart from that, the two modern 'Romeo & Juliet' never shine as well as they interact with their respective circle, instead of each other. As Tony, Richard Beymer, who's not given the meatiest role anyway, is more appealing as the ex-Jets leader desperately trying to talk the two rival gangs into peace, and Natalie Wood is irresistible as the enamored Puerto-Rican nubile, feeling so confidently pretty, witty and gay, and strong enough to defy her overly protective brother Bernardo.The love story is here and it is as pure and touching as the two idealistic lovers, but ironically, their interaction tends to slow down a narrative that is more excitingly driven by the hateful passion inhabiting the two gangs. Even the romantic songs are objectively forgettable when compared to the iconic ""America"" or the climactic ""Tonight"", even the dialogues are never as sharp and biting as when they're used in the very context of a confrontation. The romance is so overshadowed by the cinematic appeal of the rivalry that I'm wondering if ""West Side Story"", while not the best love story, might be the best hate story ever.For instance, take the two Oscar-winning roles: Rita Moreno who played Anita and George Shakiris as Bernardo, both Puerto-Rican. These are the characters that stuck to mind because they reflect the contradictions within immigrants, both strike as traditional people in their mindset but they live in lust and transgression, so much for their Catholic background and Family values. And there is a reason why Anita only half disapproves Maria's liaison, and why the most defining song is ""America"". Indeed, the catchiness of the refrain, the wit of the lyrics, Leonard Bernstein bombastic rhythm all elevates the scene to the same iconic status as ""Singin' in the Rain"" or ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"". Ironically, the song doesn't even drive the story, it's just a parenthesis revealing a gender-related shift within the ethnic one.The conflict is also between boys and girls and this is a very relevant statement about emigration, as it's common knowledge that women are more enthusiastic to embrace freedom while men, coming from patriarchal cultures, are embittered over losing their authority, let alone for Whites. This is a social relevance that foresees more serious dramas about racial tensions, like Spike Lee's ""Do The Right Thing"" or ""Jungle Fever"". And when you think about it, which other movies comes to your mind when you think of Puerto Rico? Now, where does the heat come from? For Anita, it's just about guys having to let something out, according to the cops, they're just hoodlums, according to Doc, the candy store owner, these are the youth that will make the world lousy. According to the mainly concerned ones, they're just being misunderstood. What they all can agree about is that violence is inevitable.To those who blame emigration, the film indicates an often overlooked point, it is more a generational thing, immigrants mostly consist on young people, young men whose disoriented behavior is more likely to tend toward violence when mixed with poverty. These are the roots of violence and adds the generational gap to the gender and ethnic one. And I maintain that this is one of the greatest hate stories, even more because you can hardly make hatred or war appealing, but this is where the music has the edge over the story. The film was directed by two men: Robert Wise for the drama and Jerome Robbins for the dance choreographs but there's more to admire in Robbins' direction because he really had a way with the music.And ""West Side Story"" is certainly one of the best on that level, a vast project that took months of rehearsal and that, for the first time, used the urban landscape of New York as an area of artistic expression of a troubled youth and an energetic and energizing dancing never seen before, a sort of musical tagging on Hollywood walls. Violent moments were shot like graceful poetry while poetical lyrics conveyed hotness and coolness, in all the meaning of the words. Of course, here and there, you get some dated exchanged, the whole ""chicken"" jokes are a bit redundant, but the use of violence was still risqué, not to mention some sexual innuendo, and till know, I believe one of the most sensual moments of American Cinema is Anita putting her stocking and say that she's going to have her kicks and have her private mix tonight, under the red lighting that leaves no doubt about the tragedy to comes.Love vs. Hate, men vs. women, young vs. old, Jets vs. Sharks, Robbins vs. Wise, ""West Side Story"" is constantly driven by binary forces, there are always two ""sides"" of the story, no pun intended and generally, there's one of them slightly superior to the other on a technical level, but never disposable as everything has its purpose. And the conclusion of the film, while predictable, because of the Shakespearian narrative, leaves you stunned by the incongruous power of silence. The prophecy has been fulfilled, the kids indeed made the world lousy. And Maria, like a Virgin Mary whose red dress is like spilled by all the bloodshed, blindly curses the haters and mourns her Anton, achieving the genesis of one of the all-time romances.I know I said it wasn't necessary the best, but given that it's one of the best musical ever that happen to be a romance, there was no way we could ever forget Tony and Maria, an iconic couple by proxy, but iconic nonetheless.",West Side Story

It's a clever interpretation of Romeo & Juliet with some enjoyable songs, but the story drags, and the acting & choreography feel very dated.

38,Irishchatter,A very sad and romantic movie!,9,18 October 2015,"To start this off, why on earth did they make the intro of the film so long for what, 14 minutes? They probably want to keep the viewers waiting while I bloody wanted them to get on with it! Seriously they should've known to reduce the time and not be fooling with it! Anyway I really enjoyed the film but what really was a tearjerker was the 'Taunting scene' and Tony dying from being stabbed by Maria's suppose to be fiancé Chino. God it would make you feel like your eyes are burning with rage, it just is very hard and distressing to look out. This is a very very rough story. I wouldn't show this to younger viewers because this can be a frightening experience to look at, even the racism to experience, the near rape scene and the stabbing involved in this film! This movie would really blow anyone's mind!",West Side Story
39,Bored_Dragon,Love-hated it...,8,1 April 2017,"This movie drove me crazy. I barely forced myself to see it through because it is extremely annoyingly done and I rate such movies 2/10 (1/10 is for those I gave up on), but when it finally ended I was under such an amazing impression that I wanted to rate it 10/10.The story is inspired by ""Romeo and Juliet"", but placed in NY in the mid-20th century, where two members of opponent teenage gangs fall in love. Acting, directing and music are great. The movie is extremely emotional and possesses strength and atmosphere of a theater. It has all prerequisites for excellence. And it won 10 Oscars. But...Everything in this movie is overemphasized and I hate that. However, if I observe it as a theatrical play on canvas, I can get over it.The movie starts with an instrumental intro with a frozen screen. It lasts around five minutes. At first, I thought my movie player was stuck, then I tried to find another version online and I almost gave up on watching this movie, when I finally realized it is supposed to be that way. Why would anyone do such thing I really have no idea, and that's the first minus.It's a damn musical. And one of those needlessly stretched to two and a half hours by completely redundant musical numbers. The first half of the movie is almost unwatchable and I was at the edge of giving up several times. But curiosity about how the story will go kept me going on. The story is great and some musical numbers tell parts of the story, but a good part of them just have no purpose in the movie. They are just for enjoying the music (which I did not) and to double the length of the film. That's the second minus.Just when I decided to stick it out or simply fast forward redundant parts and watch this movie till the end, the ultimate deal breaker happened that left me shocked. The scene where two gangs are closing to ""battlefield"" and mass brawl/rumble itself are shown in the form of ballet. BALLET?! Even if I didn't hate ballet, which I really do, I mean, really?! Teenage mass fight as a ballet... wtf?! The ultimately stupidest thing I saw on a big screen. Instant embarrassment transfer. Huge minus, I mean really really big.And then, in the middle of the movie, there's one more musical intermezzo with a frozen screen. That was too much for my nerves and I turned it off.But, later it bothered me how the story ends and I decided to see another half too, the very next day. The second half had more story and action and less redundancy, and musical numbers are a structural part of the plot. And the ending made me cry. And how should I rate it now...8/10Natalie Wood is so beautiful in this movie. Like an angel.",West Side Story
40,atlasmb,"Groundbreaking, Inspired, Beautiful",10,4 January 2016,"The accolades for ""West Side Story"" are numerous, including ten Oscars--and they are deserved. Featuring a cast that could dance and perform the gymnastic choreography of Jerome Robbins, the film is a modern reworking of the Romeo & Juliet story, with ethnicity--instead of family bloodlines--serving as the source of conflict.Tony (Richard Beymer) and Maria (Natalie Wood) are the couple that unexpectedly meet and instantly fall in love, despite their family allegiances to the Jets and the Sharks, ethnic gangs that war daily over the concrete-covered ""turf"" of their neighborhood. In their dedication to love, the lovers wish to rise above the petty conflicts, but fate will not allow them to exist.The moral of this story is ""Hate kills"" and it explores the behaviors of ethnic groups that refuse to listen to each other. The irony is that both groups are from immigrant populations--just that some arrived in America earlier. As depicted in the film, authority figures are either clueless or themselves bigoted.This is a groundbreaking musical, driven by the modern rhythms and New York sensibilities of Leonard Bernstein. The lyrics by Stephen Sondheim are clever, pointed, and perfectly integrated into the narrative of the film, sometimes conversational. Perhaps better than any film before, the music and dance in ""West Side Story"" advance the storyline and define its characters.Using a strong color palette and sets that break the neighborhood into a patchwork of paved boxes connected by a maze of alleyways, the visuals--including the wonderful costumes--provide strong statements about cultural differences and similarities. Aerial shots sometimes make the performers look like they are merely tracing courses they are destined to follow.The dancing is athletic and balletic, with stylized fight scenes. One can clearly see how this film influenced--at least in part--""Grease"", ""Dirty Dancing"" and the dance stylings of Michael Jackson. Though she is sometimes criticized for her performance, Natalie Wood delivers a heartfelt and lovely portrayal of Maria. The performance of Ned Glass as Doc, the store owner who is the voice of reason, also deserves mentioning. He makes a small part resonate. One other person who deserves more recognition is Marni Nixon, who voiced Maria and other characters in the film. The quality of her singing voice elevates this film as it has many others before.I wish I had seen this film when it premiered. I can just imagine what it must have been like to leave the theater, having been moved by the story, humming the tunes, and blown away by the visuals. I know I would have gone back to the theater again and again.",West Side Story
41,ironhorse_iv,"West Side Story is taking back the streets, one interpretive dance at a time. It's a classic to both American cinema and musical theater. A well-deserved masterpiece.",7,15 February 2016,"One of William Shakespeare's most popular plays has always been ""Romeo and Juliet"". The story of star-crossed lovers, has been adapted so many times for the big screen that many of them, don't really stand out, much. Directed by Robert Wise, West Side Story doesn't have that problem. This film is exceptional to point, has been deemed ""culturally significant"" by the United States Library of Congress and was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 1997. Not only that but its ten Academy Awards wins, make it, the musical film to beat. It's really hard to hate this film. Loosely inspired by Shakespeare's work, West Side Story takes the best dramatic parts of the story and moves the conflict to the Upper West Side neighborhood in New York City during the late-1950s. Instead of having the clichés and old, two royal families fight each other over family ties, honor, justice, and revenge. We have two young urban ethic gangs; the U.S.-born nativist gang known as the Jets, and the Puerto Rican immigrant gang known as the Sharks going at it, over class warfare and racism. Using this type of a conflict, and clever writing by screenwriter, Ernest Lehman, the movie is able to be shown as social commentary on the issues of race relations, immigrations and juvenile delinquents. It's these clash of cultures, where we get to see, much of the magic of West Side Story as well. Instead of using the old fashion Queen's English dialogue to push the story, along. We get then- hip American's Beat-Generation beatnik, mixed with the aficionado Spanish Harlem, dialogue. I just hate that the infamous Hays Code ruin the use of profanity. Also, the fact, that most of the slangs are now somewhat dated. However, at the time, these young men & women were still considered as cool 'Katz'. It's also nice to see major minority characters in a film. Even, if most of them, are played by white actors. Also, I like how the original Broadway's soundtrack, return for the film adaptation. It's nice to listen to the jazz and Latin aesthetics sound. It made this film, very watchable. Mad props to composter, Leonard Bernstein for making this happen. His score for West Side Story, helped bridge the gap between classical and popular music. Even, the songs by songwriter, Stephen Sondheim was amazing. It's really surprising, how catchy, songs like 'Tonight', 'America', 'I feel pretty' and 'Gee Officer Krupke"", are today, when compare to back then. Another shout out, goes to all the dance choreographers that work in this film like Jerome Robbins. The way, they were able to use ballet type moves to portray acts of violence and further the plot is pretty unique and edgy at the time. While, in today world's, the 1950s dance moves might seem a bit silly and out of touch. Its unique style still lives on. After all, we still love to snap our fingers as if we're getting ready to go to a rumble. It was revolutionary. It help create the style of dance that now feature in many, many music videos. Also, mad props to the set of abstract graphics of the city and the overhead aerial shots, created by Saul Bass. The opening and closing sequences with the NYC skyline was astonishing. Honestly, there was something that was a bit underwhelming. It had to be the two main characters, Tony Wyzek (Richard Beymer) & Maria Nunez (Natalie Woods); two members of the rival New York City gangs who fall in love with each other, only to have the tensions between their respective friends build toward tragedy end. They were written, so bland, with little to no personality, besides looking innocent and in love. It doesn't help that Richard Beymer is not really a man, I call for being charismatic. At least, not in the same level, as their original choice for the role, Elvis Presley. I don't see, how he was able to woo, Maria, off her feet. While, yes, I know, a lot of people give credit to Natalie Woods for being the glue that holds the movie, together. For me, personally, there was barely anything in her performance that 'wow' me. Yes, she look alright as eye candy; however, her singing voice was below average to the point; that she was dubbed over, for somebody else. Her character's personality was paper thin, and her screen presence as a Puerto Rican was somewhat jarring. Even, her semi touching speech in the end; was a bit disappointing. I'm really hoping for at least more from her. I really don't know, why they pass over, original Broadway actress, Carol Lawrence for this role, for Natalie Woods. I know, that she was American sweetheart, at the time, but it felt to me, that Lawrence is more suite for this type of a role. Still, I give credit for Woods for trying. Honorably, do you know, who deserve, more credit for making this film, work. Supporting actress, Rita Moreno. She was amazing in this film as Anita, Maria's closest confidante. Every scene with her, shown, the actress can handle a large number of emotional range. I'm glad, she won, an Academy Award for this role. Even, in the male side, the supporting actors were better than the main actor. I have to give, mad props to both Russ Tamblyn as Riff, Tony's friend and George Chakiris as Bernardo as Tony's rival. The jokes and intense action moments, between them, really does work. Both deserve, their high praise. Overall: With that say, West Side Story is one of the best films, made in the 1960s. West Side Story gives us, something new out of William Shakespeare's timeless novel that people were wanting for. So let's get ready to rumba! Watch it and join in, with the fun.",West Side Story
42,kenjha,Cool,9,4 July 2010,"Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"" is transformed into a modern day musical about rival gangs in New York. Under Wise's sure-handed direction and Robbins's energetic choreography, this is a majestic experience from start to finish. Perhaps Wood and Beymer seem a bit weak in the leads but this is only because, by comparison, Moreno, Chakiris, and Tamblyn are so good in the key supporting roles. With the marvelous music by Bernstein and lyrics by Sondheim, the film is chock full of memorable songs. Highlights include the sweet ""Maria,"" rollicking ""America,"" tuneful ""Tonight,"" effervescent ""I Feel Pretty,"" and funny ""Gee, Officer Krupkee.""",West Side Story

Some people fall in love in New York. And there are gangs and it boring. And who cares. Why did this get 7.6. Any one likes a good story should hate it. And any one who like good music should hate it. This is not Romeo and Juliet. This is campy crap trying to be like Romeo and Juliet. This is 50's cheese say way from it. Do not waste your time.

44,sol-,My brief review of the film,7,11 January 2005,"An interesting vision of Shakespeare's well known play; set to music and built around dance routines. It is enjoyable to watch, but there is too much emphasis on the spirited choreography, leaving the film rather thin in terms of plot. There are indeed some memorable songs and some well choreographed sequences, but the film offers little else, or anything on a deeper level. One should note too that the first five minutes of the film are useless, but the whole overall product is certainly not  it simply just is not a masterpiece. It became the first film with a dual direction to win the Best Director Oscar  and to this day it is the only such winner.",West Side Story
45,didi-5,stunning stuff,10,26 June 2000,"This remains a all-time favourite - and I love musicals, can't get enough of them. This is one of the best - great songs, brilliant dance sequences, and a cast to die for (Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer are perfect - they may not do their own singing but my goodness, they ARE Maria and Tony). The opening sequence where colours and drawings slowly turn into the city sky-scape is excellent. 'America', 'Jet Song' and 'Cool', my favourite sequences, stand up to repeated viewings. 'West Side Story' is a tragic film; Romeo and Juliet in the rough American streets, out there and real. This film has a message to give and it does it well. Special mention has to go to Rita Moreno as Anita -you'd never believe the same girl had been the screen Tuptim in King and I a few years before. What an actress.

47,Dr_Coulardeau,Love is forever and ever dramatic and tragic,10,17 March 2008,"This film is a myth, like the musical it comes from. It has been alive and a success as a musical for more than 50 years and about the same for the film when it became a VHS tape and now a DVD. It is doomed to be a lasting success, hence a classic in its genre and field.Of course it is a rewriting of Romeo and Juliet but with a twist, i.e. the two young people are simple young people and not members of the aristocratic families of an ancient city. They are second or third generation immigrants in New York of European origins, the jets, versus the first generation immigrants from Porto Rico, the Sharks. The girl is a Porto Rican and the boy is a New Yorker. In fact the first fight is very similar in a way to what happened in Shakespeare's play. Riff is killed by Bernardo, Bernardo is killed by Anton and there is the twist. Chino picks up the vengeance of Bernardo and runs after Tony and he will shoot Tony in the arms of Maria who will survive. Tony's body will be taken away by members of both gangs.The context is completely different and the New Yorkers are very good at mocking other people, cops, judges, head shrinks and social workers and at depicting their fate as the most dramatic and tragic alienation, exploitation and dereliction. They all are born Mercutios. They are the victims of the smoke of tobacco and other stuffs, the fumes of alcohol and other wines, the beatings of their fathers and other parents, etc. They are just discrete on the sexual part because of the time (1961 for the film) and the targeted audience that has to be a family audience even if it is Parental Guidance on my DVD.There is not much to add to this since the twist does not really change Shakespeare's lesson. Bigotry, racism, hate and a few other of these subhuman passions are dominant with simple people in any society and they guide their passions, feelings, actions and reactions. These simple people can kill in a mob and even individually when such emotions take hold of them. And after that there is nothing left for the survivors to do except to cry and suffer in silence if possible.But this film, then VHS tape and now DVD brings up a completely different discussion. The musical was for an elite audience, that of the Broadway theatres. The film was for a wider public though the cinemas needed to be equipped in wide screens, color projectors and sound systems of quality. It anyway reached a wider audience than the play. The film amplified the success of the musical. The VHS tape came later and in fact was the cause and amplification of the first revival twenty years later. The DVD was in the same way the cause and the amplification of the second revival of the musical some twenty more years later. Each revival went along with a vast tour in the USA and Canada but also all over the world, especially the second since many cities are now equipped in special large halls for such super productions.But the live musical and the DVD are not the same.The live musical takes you into the magic of a show on a stage with lights and sets that are supposed to fascinate you, with actors, singers and dancers that are supposed to mesmerize you and a music that is supposed to charm you. But you are sitting in one place and cannot move and you can at best use special binoculars to zoom on some actors or singers but then you lose the wide picture. A show like this one is of course entirely nourished with conventions in the acting, the singing, the performing, and so on, of every single artist on the stage or in front of the stage or anywhere else in the house. Conventions and trade-unions that can at times dictate the rhythm of the show. The spectator is supposed to let him/herself slide into that magic and enjoy both visually and auditorily but the heavy machinery that produces the lights, the amplification and the various physical elements of the show take you for a real dance and you may fly into the show. The very strong sentimental scenes and situations may carry your emotions away too. But that will remain moderate due to the distance between you and the characters.The film, VHS and then DVD are free of such constraints, at least for you. This film uses a real location, New York itself from the very start wince we come from the sky to land in the street of the West side of Manhattan after a slowly zooming overview down into the streets from the sky. This real location is of course an enormous change because of the liberation it provides the actors, singers and dancers. They have space, they can move, climb, run, and do many other things without any limits, or nearly none. They can play basketball in real conditions. They even have cars in the street and the cops come into the various street situations with their cars blinking blue end red like some bleeding heart.The second change you perceive from the very start is of course the great mobility of the camera. You can shift from one angle to another instantly and that creates movement in the picture and on the screen since you are constantly capturing the situation from a myriad points of view. This acceleration of the camera's movements and multiplication of shooting angles really project you into the action or suck you up into it if your prefer and you are a lot more involved in the action, in the film. You are no longer a simple voyeur. You are part of the action itself.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",West Side Story
48,eddie_baggins,A fun a colorful musical ride through New York. Bring on the remake!,8,29 January 2019,"With Steven Spielberg well under-way on construction of his long-mooted and finally happening reimaging, I thought it was about time I finally sat down and watched Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise's well-regarded musical from start to finish (4 minute plus opening title sequence included), all 150 minutes of toe-taping, gloriously over the top melodrama of it.The West Side Story (winner of 10 Oscars), a name that will be recognisable to many a cinephile and those that prefer the Broadway side of showbiz, as its well and truly one of the most colourful, silly and undeniably kitschy musicals in cinema history and these almost 60 years on from its initial release have done nothing to dampen the fun the film provides, even around its campy dialogue and questionable casting/acting.A brilliantly fun and colour-filled reimaging of the New York street scape, Robbins and Wise's take on the Romeo and Juliet doomed romance tale sees late actress Natalie Wood's Maria (playing a migrant!) meet and instantaneously fall in love with Richard Beymer's proud American Tony, as the two find themselves torn between a racial war between two factions that are keen to battle it out once and for all in the spare time they find themselves when they aren't singing, dancing and clapping their way around the films fabulous sets.It's all highly predictable, done in a way typical of its time and place but Wise's and Robbin's direction is filled with energy and creativity that works well with esteemed songwriter Stephen Sondheim's now mostly iconic songs (America and I Feel Pretty a highlight) and Leonard Bernstein's booming and almost constant score, which help make West Side Story a winner despite its aged flaws and certain inceptions.Watching the film today well-after the fact, its clear to see how such a vibrant, charismatic and fun film would've inspired a whole new generation of filmmaker's looking to tell their stories in ways that would've previously seemed impossible or too over the top and its exciting to think about the possibilities this world provides a filmmaker like Spielberg to envision for the big screen and fans of musical cinema have every right to be excited about what the great bearded one's remake is likely to do.It might not be the best movie musical ever made, but its one of the most easily accessible and enjoyable and a very clear touchstone for many that followed, even the colour and tone of modern classic La La Land can be found here in this epically staged ride.Final Say -Not for everyone and the victim of some unfortunately aged tendencies, West Side Story is still a major piece of cinematic history that takes a relatively small-scale story and turns it into something grand, operatic and exciting. A worthy member of top-class movie musicals, Wise's and Robbins film is worth a re-visit or like me a first time viewing, you'll be guaranteed a toe-tapping good time!4 policed dances out of 5",West Side Story

51,damianphelps,Quite Impressive,8,3 April 2021,"WSS delivers drama like few musicals even attempt. I had just watched Calamity Jane with Doris Day and found it lacking on so many level. To then have WWS as my next view was a fortunate treat.Its not all beer and skittles. To be honest the singing in WSS is pretty awful. The dancing though more than makes up for it.Beyond the singing and dancing the film packs a nice punch loading up the drama as the story moves along.A couple of other critical comments. The film could have been maybe 20 minutes shorter and not lost anything (especially the long opening scene) and Wood playing a Puerto Rican didn't work for me. She fit the character of a love interest, just no the Latino heritage.Those are small gripes though.WSS is a great movie :)",West Side Story
52,SAMTHEBESTEST,A Classic Love story fighting against Cultural Hatred..,8,12 May 2020,"West Side Story (1961) :
Brief Review -A Classic Love story fighting against Cultural Hatred.. West Side Story is just not a love story as it is advertised, or if can say it's not a love story but a lesson on Cultural superstitious fights. The rivalary between white Americans and PRs (Puerto Rican) turns ugly and causes some tragic incidents to make them realise that Fighting each other is not not gonna help. Peace should be attained to Live happily. But the main factor in the film is Lovestory between a White American Guy and a PR Girl which turns into Tragedy and then lifetime lesson to both the rival gangs. A realistic story comes to screen in the form of performing arts i.e. Dance and Music and both the things have been chronographed meaningfully. The use of Red lights, Blue lights, Dancing moves while fighting clearly indicates the smartness of director in storytelling. Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood's chemistry is lovely whereas Rita Moreno and George Chakiris delivered truly worthy Oscar winning performances. Director duo Robert Wise & Jerome Robbins collaborate and balance the script smoothly in this musical narrative. Thier vision to take this story forward and end it on tragic note is definitely praiseworthy. West Side Story is often called as an Underrated film by IMDb users and i agree with them cent percent. 7.5/10* for this film is too low considering the kind of message and impact film left on serious issue like social hatred. I don't care if the film deserved 10 Oscars (Record for any Musical) or not but all i have to say is, This is an absolutely Classic piece of storytelling in Musical genre. I haven't seen any Musical till date that can bring social and cultural change like this. 60s decade was a Musical Era for Hollywood where we got so many commercial and critical successfull films but this film was just not made for entertainment like others.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest",West Side Story
53,matthewssilverhammer,"Pyschedelic, Important, and Fun",8,3 October 2019,"With ""America"", they pull off the impossible: a vibrant musical feat, that adeptly captures the immigrant sentiment without losing its sense of fun. That mixture really represents the whole film well. The script is smart and caring (and effectively sad), the music is astounding (other than the too-often boring slow romance songs), and Robbins and Wise's direction is beautiful and artful. The cast isn't great (some mediocre singing, Wood as Puerto Rican), but they hardly distract from the spectacle.",West Side Story
54,Movie_Muse_Reviews,How Shakespeare and the musical endure--especially together,8,1 March 2009,"The fact that ""West Side Story"" is based on Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"" is one of those knowledge tidbits that people seem to pride themselves on, but the truth is that the classic tragedy of star-crossed lovers is most of what makes ""West Side Story"" strike a note with audiences. Add to that story an impeccable score written by musical theatre legends Stephen Sondheim and Leonard Bernstein, some vivid choreography by the legendary Jerome Robbins and you have something that can capture the hearts of almost anyone.In 1950s New York City, the streets are owned by the gangs: the Jets, good old American bad boys, and the Sharks, Puerto Rican immigrants. Though generally both sides are all talk, no actual action, that all begins to change when an ""ex"" Jet (because when you're a Jet you're a Jet all the way) named Tony falls for Maria, little sister of the Sharks' leader Bernardo. Their secret affair grows amid a forthcoming rumble that promises to change all their lives.""West Side Story"" nearly swept the Academy Awards, taking home statues for 10 of its 11 nominations. From a modern perspective, it's hard to see why at first, but when you get down to it, it's very clear. Robbins, who also directs, (alongside Robert Wise), creates a Manhattan that could only exist in a fairytale. Not that it's magical or enchanted, but it intentionally lacks any historical/locational context outside of the costumes and hairstyles. The streets of the city are empty except for the gangs--nothing seems to happen outside of their little world. What this does is set us up to watch that world come crashing down as the tragedy ensues.Robbins creates that world with a long opening sequence of gang members dancing and fighting with elegant grace. It comes off as odd, but it really sets the desired tone for the film. Everything is a song and dance. Robbins' choreography is sharp and popping, adding to the excitement of the film. The music is phenomenal, providing a wide range of styles that create a wide range of emotions. From the aggressive, vibrant ""Dance at the Gym"" and ""America"" to the youthfully optimistic ""Maria"" and ""Somewhere,"" there's various moods all throughout this film. The costume and background colors (reds and purples for the Sharks and blues, golds and oranges for the Jets) reflect this at points too.The acting is certainly not the film's best aspect, but it shouldn't go unmentioned. Oscar- winner Rita Moreno plays up the fantastic part that is Anita, Bernardo's girlfriend; Natalie Wood outshines her co-star as Maria. In general, the characters of the film are rather one- dimensional, so actors like Richard Beymer (Tony) can get away with having only a love- struck look on his face the entire film. At the same time, the one-dimensionality is part of creating the fairytale illusion. You know that by film's end these characters are going to be more complex.What it comes down to, however, is that the story will get you every time. It's the reason ""Romeo and Juliet"" has resonated through centuries: seeing the tragedy unfold when you know these kids were just monkeying around is very sobering, especially after the whimsical, musical journey that is the major portion of the film. It's an inescapable emotional trap: even though you see how ridiculous Tony and Maria's love is, you care about the story unfolding and the hate and prejudice bothers you. It's as if out of nowhere, this fun, cute little musical evolves into something that resonates tremendously as a period piece and warning about intolerance in general. It's the stuff classics are made of.~Steven CVisit my site http://moviemusereviews.com",West Side Story
55,freemantle_uk,An old-fashion style musical,7,8 December 2019,"The Bernstein and Sondheim musical West Side Story was a retelling of Romeo and Juliet, moving the setting to 1950s New York. The film version follows Tony (Richard Beymer), a reluctant member of the Jets, a Polish gang, and a Puerto Rican Maria (Natalie Wood), the sister of a rival gang leader.West Side Story has fantastic dance sequences and had extra themes on racism and immigration. Whilst the action was mostly clean-cut there were some hard-hitting moments in the final act, especially the ending. Wood was a joyful delight as Maria. It was an old-fashioned musical that was a bit too long: the film opens with a 15-minute long dance sequence. One for genre fans.",West Side Story

Even though I'm not a big fan of this particular genre of film. I found West Side Story to be so impressively produced that it somehow transcended far beyond being just a mere ""Musical"" in the strictest sense of the word.West Side Story is literally bursting at the seams and filled to capacity with vivid imagery. This highly-energized film clearly captures the vibrant atmosphere of the late 1950s, where rival youth gangs get their prejudiced, little noses out of joint and prepare to rumble in the streets of NYC.With its memorable music and songs, dazzling choreography, striking sets and superb direction by Robert Wise, West Side Story is truly a triumph on every level.This film is a magnificent achievement that (back in 1961) set a whole new standard for modern-day movie Musicals.",West Side Story

It has the most wonderful choreography,an outstanding score and imaginative photography to bring to the party. From the opening whistles far below the skyscrapers to the end titles presented as graffiti,the film is a constantly surprising visual delight. The mixture of music and images is so compelling that the lacklustre lead performances don't really seem to matter unduly. Concentrate instead on the remarkable Miss R.Moreno whose performance in ""America"" has never been bettered in my opinion. It is a film to be enjoyed in youth and savoured in old age.

58,PWNYCNY,This movie withstands the test of time.,10,18 December 2008,"West Side Story is one of the greatest movie musicals in the history of Hollywood. The story is timeless, the dancing highly energetic and innovative, the acting strong, especially that of Russ Tamblyn who gives one of the great performances in movie musical history. The music and lyrics are classics and the dialog is strong, relevant and entertaining. This movie withstands the test of time. It could be released today and play to an audience. The choreography is stunning. It's like Grease, except that this movie is not a parody and is the original thing. The ethnic tensions, the intensity of the dialog, the snappy dancing, the actual time line of the story itself, condensed into a 24-hour period, makes for an exciting movie that keeps the audience engaged. One thing about this movie, you won't be bored. This movie is also unique in that it succeeds not through the leads but through the incredible supporting cast whose powerful screen presence makes this movie work, and work well. George Chikaris, Rita Moreno and Tucker Smith are great. One can only wonder how Larry Kert would have done in this movie. (Mr. Kert is the actor who originally performed the role of Tony on Broadway). There are some who criticize this movie but what is there to criticize? If you like movies with great music, wonderful dancing and a compelling story, watch this movie.One other point: regarding the song ""Tonight"", this play takes the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet and propels it to new heights of dramatic power, transforming the poetry of Shakespeare into a musical number that is not only enjoyable, inspirational and memorable but iconic, especially the version as performed by the original performers of the song, Larry Kert and Carol Lawrence.",West Side Story
59,CubsandCulture,Grossly ill conceived on every front...,3,11 November 2018,"This is one of the most inexplicable big winners in Oscar history. I am at a complete lost to explain why this was as well received. Every step of the way the film's producers made awkward poorly thought out choices that make the film a campy grating mess. It is a version of Romeo and Juliet in which only Romeo dies. It is a story of gang violence done in interpretive dance. It is story of bigotry toward Puerto Ricans where the most Caucasian actress imaginable is the main Puerto Rican. It's a screenplay that aims to tells a timeless story only to saddle every line with 50's slang.I guess the musical aspects are well done. It is hard to really care if the interpretative ballot is well executed when it should not be the case that gang members are doing it. A lot of the songs are catchy, I will give the film that. And at least Anita and Bernardo are compelling characters. But it is not enough to make up for the campy aspects of the film.Almost all of the problems stem from Wise/Robbins deciding to make the boldest and most colorful choices possible. The film is often very striking to look at. So striking that it simply doesn't feel believable and in light of it being a hodge podge of creative influences this renders the film completely artificial. It may be the worst best picture. It is certainly the worst big winner.",West Side Story
60,Nazi_Fighter_David,An artistic triumph of the first magnitude...,10,11 August 2002,"Shakespeare's classic 'Romeo and Juliet,' is transported by Robert Wise, beyond the conventional movie musical, to modern-day New York City... Shakespeare's Montagues and Capulets become two rival teen-age street gangs: the 'American' Jets and the Puerto Rican Sharks... The two young idealistic lovers enhance the attractiveness of two nice kids, caught in racial and ethnic barriers... They are victims of the intolerance, misunderstanding, and mistrust that seem to be ever-present in human society... The film (nominated for an incredible 11 Academy Awards) took home an incredible 10 Oscars including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (George Chakaris), Best Supporting Actress (Rita Moreno), and Best Direction (Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins). The opening of West Side Story is very innovative... As the overture plays, an abstract design on the screen changes color and becomes a breathtaking aerial view of the island of Manhattan... The camera finally swings down to the West side of New York, where the Jets are snapping their fingers as they walk the streets... Their hated Puerto Rican rivals, the Sharks appear, charged with aggressive energy... Both gangs compete for the control of the poor and filth neighborhood... Jerome Robbins's powerful choreography captures the explosive tension boiling in the big city slums... The streets (with their flick knives and razors) come alive with athletic young dancers... The tender lyrics and poignant music complement and balance the tough nature of the choreography... The songs advance the plot, and illustrate the action... They range from jazzy and feverish to lyrical to comical, and they are all richly evocative of the film's moods and characters... In ""Maria,"" Tony gives voice to his feelings about the girl he has come to love... In ""I Feel Pretty,"" Maria describes her own reactions to the miracle of love... Before their lives turn bleak, the two lovers express their joy in soaring music: Tony with his hopeful 'Something's Coming,' Maria with her entrancing 'I Feel Pretty,' accompanied by Anita and her teasing friends... Their love blossoms out on a poignant scene in ""Tonight,"" and at a bridal shop (""One hand, One Heart"") when both affirm their love for each other by celebrating a mock marriage ceremony... 'West Side Story' is a beautiful work of art with spectacular music and energetic dancing... It is surely the finest dance musical since 'Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.' The principal dance numbers are all terrific... The propulsive movement of Riff and the Jets as contrasted with the free movement of Bernardo and the Sharks... Rita Moreno is spitfire as Anita... Her skillful dancing and Latin temperament are perfect for the character of Anita, a fiery lady who leads her girls in an exciting mambo dance... ""Life is alright in America"" is possibly the most triumphant sequence of the film... A welcome tone of mockery is introduced, and the 'mambo' atmosphere makes you want to jump out of your seat and dance...'West Side Story' is a calculated milestone in screen musicals... It breaks new ground in its depiction of contemporary social issues in a musical... The motion picture explores with deep emotional resonance, a world of hate, violence and prejudice... It challenges all of us to struggle for understanding and justice... History will remember Leonard Bernstein as the most important American musical force in the 20th Century... He is one of the greatest conductors that has ever lived... In 'West Side Story' his superb music communicates directly with the heart...",West Side Story
61,arthur_tafero,Finest Musical of All Time - West Side Story,7,6 June 2020,"There have been many fine musicals in the history of Hollywood; Singin in the Rain, The Sound of Music, The Wizard of Oz, My Fair Lady, Oliver, Gigi, and a few others: But none of these has the emotional impact of West Side Story. And while most musicals have two or three notable songs in them, West Side Story has at least half a dozen songs that almost everyone who has seen it remembers. This is, of course, Leonard Bernstein's masterpiece of music. It is also the high point of Robert Wise's considerably successful career as a director. The cast has several sterling performances, but none better than Rita Moreno. Natalie Wood and George Chakiris also give excellent performances.
But it is the transformation of the obvious tragedy of Romeo and Juliet to modern New York and two rival gangs that really make the film the greatest musical of all time. The film is all fun and games in the first half of the film, but we are treated to a real jolt of reality in the second half. If ever a film was needed in this time of shaky race relations, this film foots the bill 100%. Every slight that Puerto Ricans were the brunt of in 1961, have also been suffered by the black community as well; there is virtually no difference between the two, other than cultural backgrounds. Racism and police brutality are alive and well in the film as well; even though most of it is verbal. Sometimes words can hurt more than blows.
The film also teaches us a lesson about love. Even though the love is tragic, it is better to have loved and lost than to have nerver loved at all.",West Side Story

It's so ahead of its time, many of the things shown here are still very relevant to this day, if not even more than it was back then. There are also some beautiful scenes, just as well as there are some dark scenes, the contrast this film has is fascinating. One of the best musicals ever.",West Side Story
63,slokes,Tough To Sit Through,4,4 February 2009,"It's not that ""West Side Story"" doesn't deserve its resilient popularity; just that I don't understand it.Tony loves Maria. Maria loves Tony. They kiss and sing about it. Tony's gang hates Maria's brother and his friends. Ditto the other way around. They dance and sing about it. All this is played out roughly along the lines of Shakespeare's ""Romeo And Juliet"", for two and a half hours.I kept looking at the clock.""West Side Story"" has many problems. The central romance between Natalie Wood's Maria and Richard Beymer's Tony is dully written and blandly performed, while the acting around them is stagy and broad. The script is smothered in cliché, especially when attempting to mimic teenage patter. Too many of the songs by Stephen Sondheim and Leonard Bernstein are inert, unhummable and fail to stir. Co-director Robert Wise labors to give his film a gritty texture, but this is totally undercut by the choreography of the other director, Jerome Robbins. It's hard to buy a street fight where battles consist of pirouetting and leapfrogs.There's no denying ""West Side Story"" was a big hit, and resonates with many today. It definitely showcases Wise's versatility. I didn't like his other Oscar-winning musical from four years later, ""The Sound Of Music"", but for an almost completely different set of reasons.The film does look great, decently shot and sumptuously detailed. There are three songs on the soundtrack even I like: ""Maria"", ""America"", and especially ""I Feel Pretty"", which make their mark and move things along nicely. Russ Tamblyn as the leader of the Jets, Riff, stands out with his acrobatic dance moves and his way with a line as he prepares for another gang war:""We fought hard for this turf, and we ain't just gonna give it up...I say this turf is small, but it's all we got.""Perhaps the biggest issue I have with ""West Side Story"" is the way it staggers after significance, from the opening titles (Saul Bass is usually so much better) to the closing scene where what's left of the cast assembles at a darkened playground to lick their wounds. Again and again, the stabs at greatness clash with the artificiality of the musical form and the staginess of the acting and direction. It seems a bad idea to mix backlot sets with real street shots of Manhattan; if ""West Side Story"" was going to work, at least for me, it needed to either dive more deeply into the fantasy side of the story or else be conceived a whole different way.Of course, that wasn't a problem with the Broadway musical, where artifice and big showstopping moments are part of the accepted vocabulary. On film, though, it all rings a little hollow.""Loving is enough"", Maria tells Tony near the end.""Not here,"" he replies.He means the mean West Side streets, but I thought for a moment about the movie camera. Maybe it's just me.",West Side Story
64,EUyeshima,Still Startling and Still Finger-Snapping Cool Especially with Jerome Robbins' Dazzling Choreography,9,24 January 2007,"There is no getting around the fact that this 1961 musical melodrama is a monumental work by theater masters at their peak - Leonard Bernstein's timeless music; Stephen Sondheim's clever, character-driven lyrics; and above all, Jerome Robbins' dazzling choreography, an unprecedented blend of ballet, jazz and modern moves that uniquely belong to this show. Fortunately, all of this is beautifully captured on the pristine 70-mm print and audio transfer found on the two-disc 2003 Special Edition DVD. What's more, the cinematic translation of the Broadway hit co-directed by Robbins and veteran Robert Wise shows a film that not only conveys the vibrancy of the original show but adds dramatic texture in the reshuffling of its renowned songs in order to better propel the familiar storyline.The home turf Jets and the recently arrived Puerto Rican Sharks are at war in the tenements of New York's Upper West Side in the late 1950's. The ethnically divided rival gangs are already at a boiling point when Tony meets Maria across a crowded floor at the community dance. The problem is that Tony is a founder of the Jets who quit to work as a stock boy at Doc's candy store, and Maria is the coddled little sister of Bernardo, the Sharks' leader. Needless to say, things don't go well for the teenaged lovers but not before the respective sides confront each other with the most athletic, macho-driven dance moves not seen since Gene Kelly's golden MGM period. Starting with the highly dramatic overhead shots of Manhattan, the prologue is justly celebrated as a stunning expression of Robbins' genius in formulating dance moves that fluently convey the gangs' swagger and menace.As the story settles on the core romance, the movie maintains its momentum and high energy through the memorable score, in particular, the three powerful ensemble pieces - ""America"", in which the Sharks boys and girls playfully but pointedly argue the merits of living in the U.S.; the ""Quintet"" with its dynamic cross-cutting showing the diverse shades of anticipation for the final rumble; and ""Cool"", in which the revenge-driven, post-rumble Jets plot to find Tony before the Sharks do. The slower tempo songs have long since become a part of the established American songbook. What holds the music and action together is the strongly individualistic visual style set forth by Daniel Fapp's color-saturated cinematography (the reds really pop) and Boris Leven's impressive production design (only the prologue was filmed on location). Even though Arthur Laurents' original book and Ernest Lehman's screenplay have retro-hip dialogue that now sounds quaint next to today's youth-oriented movies, the story still maintains a dramatic gravitas that has certainly worked since Shakespeare's day.Although obviously not a Latina, 22-year old Natalie Wood is still picture-perfect as Maria. Carrying most of the pathos of the love story, she completely nails the final tragic scene with tear-jerking aplomb. Less successful is the toothy Richard Beymer as Tony, looking too freshly scrubbed and acting too naïve to be credible as a former gang leader. Yet despite the obvious vocal dubbing, they play their duets with poignancy. Russ Tamblyn, already a longtime film veteran at that point, plays Tony's best friend Riff with gusto and shows off his amazing acrobatic dancing skills with fervor. George Chakiris, a far more polished dancer than Tamblyn, is a searing presence as Bernardo, though the best all-around performer is a fiery Rita Moreno as Bernardo's fast-assimilating girlfriend, Anita. Singing (with one notable exception), dancing and acting up a storm, she lends a scene-stealing energy too infrequently used in a film career that goes back to 1952's ""Singin' in the Rain"". The rest of the dancers perform in nova-like bursts with amazing precision and synchronization.The first disc of the 2003 DVD contains the movie itself and surprisingly comes with no commentary track. While this is an unfortunate omission, it is more than offset by the second disc's main attraction, an hour-long documentary called ""West Side Memories"", which is about as good a retrospective making-of feature as I have seen on a DVD. Almost all the surviving contributors to the film are interviewed albeit briefly in some cases - Wise and Lehman (both of whom died just last year), Sondheim, Laurents, Beymer, Tamblyn, Moreno (especially sprightly) and a couple of the Jets, Tony Mordente (Action) and Harvey Hohnecker (Mouthpiece). Interspersed throughout is not only footage from the movie but production stills and home movies recorded by one of the dancers, Robert Banas.There are nuggets galore in the documentary, for instance, remembrances of Robbins' choreographic brilliance, taxing perfectionism and insensitivity to the budget (which led to him being fired midway through filming); Wood's valiant but wavering singing voice (which was subsequently dubbed by the oft-used Marni Nixon); and the dubbing of Moreno's and Tamblyn's voices for key numbers. The other extras are not nearly as interesting - a five-minute montage showing storyboards translated into the actual shots; the original intermission music interlude; a couple hundred production stills in a clickable format; and four separate trailers. The biggest extra is actually a hefty scrapbook that includes the entire text of the screenplay and other related material essential to only the most die-hard of fans.",West Side Story
65,Steffi_P,"""The most beautiful sound""",10,28 December 2009,"The classic Hollywood musical, though popular with public and critics in its day, now seems to have more detractors than admirers. The screen version of West Side Story has found itself under attack from both sides, not only from ""serious"" film fans who consider all musicals to be frivolous and unrealistic, but also snobbish appreciators of the stage original like Keith Garebian, who described it as a ""Hollywood vulgarisation""*.It's fair enough that West Side Story is something of a sacred cow for Broadway fans. Leonard Bernstein, although not as prolific as Gerschwin, Berlin, Kern, Rodgers or Loewe, placed himself on a par with these giants of musical theatre with this one score, a mix of edgy jazz and heart-wrenching melody. The Arthur Laurents story has enough bold changes to make the Romeo and Juliet tale work for the modern era, while still retaining the forceful core and emotional impact of Shakespeare's play. Then there is the choreography of Jerome Robbins, turning aggressive tension into dance moves, with complex layers and patterns that seem almost contradictory but work harmoniously. But what is really special is how all these things weave into each other. Bernstein's score references and repeats itself; for example the oft-heard whistle, the opening line of ""Ma-ri-a"" and the start of the baseline for ""Cool"" are all the same three notes. The choreography picks up on every subtlety of the music, and blurs the lines between dancing and fighting. Even the dialogue has a kind of snappy rhythm to it, allowing the talkie scenes to flow straight into the musical numbers.Walter Mirisch, who acquired the filming rights, knew what he was doing when he handed the project to two directors, Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise. Robbins had directed it for the stage, and there was really no-one better to ensure his own choreography survived intact for the screen version. However with no experience behind a camera, it was unlikely he could have tackled the whole thing single-handed. Robert Wise was the perfect partner for him, a highly professional and dedicated screen director, who had never done a musical before but had proved himself sensitive to rhythm and movement in pictures such as This Could Be the Night and I Want to Live!. Between them, Wise and Robbins have reproduced the synchronicity of the stage show, as well as extending it in a cinematic dimension.In the location-shot ""Prologue"", the camera becomes a part of the choreography, beginning with those jerky pans in time with the Jets' finger-clicking. This I believe was largely the input of Robbins, who was apparently fascinated by what cinema could do. He does some great work with colour, such us the red background that suddenly comes into view in that first close up of George Chakiris (Bernardo). As well as the dramatic scenes, I understand Wise was solely responsible for directing the less dance-orientated numbers such ""Something's Coming"", ""Maria"" and ""Tonight"". His approach is subtler, but he still cleverly merges image and music, keeping the camera close for the quieter moments, then pulling back as the song becomes bigger, allowing the backgrounds to become part of the tone. Wise also holds up the musicality elsewhere. One trick this former editor uses is to ensure that at key moments consecutive shots are jarringly different in colour and arrangement, which keeps that jagged rhythm going in image as well as sound.One major source of controversy was the changes to the cast. It was a fact in Hollywood at this time that non-singing actors would be cast in the lead roles, to be dubbed by non-acting singers. It's a shame I admit, but it's reasonable. Natalie Wood was a marvellous dramatic player and experienced movie actress, adept at emoting for the camera. Richard Beymer is not an exceptionally good lead man, but he is good enough, and at least looks the part. Still, one thing that couldn't be faked was dancing, and all the gang members are necessarily played by professionals in this respect. What is great about these supporting players is that they make dancing, singing and acting become one. Russ Tamblyn, George Chakiris and especially the magnificent Rita Moreno all dance in the way their character should move. Moreno, using her own voice for all but one number, continues to spit out her lyrics just as Anita would, treating each song as a piece of drama.But there are still one or two things for the theatre snobs to nitpick over. There is the re-ordering of several songs to take place at different times. This was done to keep the lighter songs in the first half of the picture and keep the darkening of mood towards the end consistent, and it works for the film. Bernstein apparently did not like this recording of his score, but it doesn't seem to have done the picture any harm. And there are of course those who will automatically object to a screen adaptation of anything on principle, but let's face it – we don't really need to address that here do we? All of which leaves us with just the whinges of the pretentious film fans, who seem to think that cinema is only about ""auteurs"", film noir, nouvelle vague, the art house and bloody Stanley Kubrick. There isn't much to say to this bunch. All they need is to lighten up, stop being afraid of a little music and dance, and realise that gritty realism isn't the only way to make a point.*In his book, The Making of West Side Story, which is about the Broadway production.",West Side Story

67,Spleen,It could hardly have failed,10,23 July 1999,"Note the opening credits.  I use the term ""credits"" loosely, because there aren't any.  There's just a reddish orangish title card which changes colour ever so slowly while they play the overture.  Now THAT takes courage. Obviously Wise was certain that Bernstein's music provides so much interest on its own that it would have been redundant to do anything but play it. And he was right.  Bernstein simply wrote better music than any other Broadway composer of his day - much better music - and whether or not ""West Side Story"" contains his very best music, it's his very best musical.  It would take a special effort to make a bad movie out of it.In fact Wise handles things very well.  We get the same silent sweep over New York that he later gave us over Austria in ""The Sound of Music"" - the sweep that says, ""I'm going to show you New York"" (or Austria, as the case may be).  The filming and the colours are stark and intentionally artificial: it does feel as if we are being shown a city.  Performances are all fine.Of course, most of what makes this film great was already present in the musical.  But what's wrong with that?  Surely Wise shouldn't HAVE to spin straw into gold.

I thought... am I going to live among people like the crowd in ""West Side Story""...? That was a movie that I had not liked very much when I saw it during a reposition, during my adolescence. But then I took the plane(s) --in those days there were no direct flights from Panamá, so you had to go via Aruba or Miami, for example-- and when I arrived in Borikén... the magic of Atlantis fell on me! I tell you, I lived there the happiest years of my life. I became conscious of what an fool I was, a Catholic boy raised by priests in a school for only boys, I went to college (I do not how I finished the career, but I did), I did theater all around the island, I saw theater from all nations, I discovered sex, I became class conscious, I marched the streets for the independence of Puerto Rico, I tried a few drugs, I went to beaches, to the greens, I had great lovers and a wonderful Boston woman as tutor whom I live with... who ws never home sick and never said ""I want to live in América..."" like Rita Moreno. While living there, I went to a town next to San Juan, called Carolina, to watch ""WSS"" again. I hated it even more! Years have passed, I met Miss Moreno, I had to watch the thing for a third time for a film history book I was working on, and I reconciled a bit with it. Robert Wise had a knack to give some fresh air and take the Best Director Academy Award for filming old theater dinosaurs like ""WSS"" and ""The Sound of Music. In both cases, after I saw the real plays on stage I realized what a good job Wise had done and what a wonderful screenwriter Ernest Lehman was, judging from his adaptations of both plays to film. In ""WSS"" a few dance numbers are great, some scenes can move anyone to tears, Natalie Wood was a beautiful leading lady and I wish Russ Tamblyn had had better luck in cinema. But not much more. I still believe it is racist, ethnocentric (even if it tries to convince you that it is not, as «Star Wars» does with imperialism), too stagy and overlong. I can go to Puerto Rico any moment, but watching this a fourth time... I have to live in Woop Woop to do that.",West Side Story

70,bkrauser-81-311064,A Raw and Fun Shakespeare Adaptation,9,13 April 2016,"As far as Shakespeare adaptations go, West Side Story is considered by many to be among the strongest, singularly unique, eye-poppingly flamboyant; in short, best adaptations committed to film. That is a list that includes Laurence Olivier's Hamlet (1948) and the ""Taming of the Shrew's"" variation, 10 Things I Hate About You (1999). Retooling arguably one of the most overrated plays in the English language, West Side Story opens and breathes new life into the themes of ""Romeo and Juliet"" relocating the tragic love story from seventeenth century Verona to nineteen sixties Manhattan. I had the pleasure of watching West Side Story first as a young man then only a few days ago as an adult. While most kids grew up with ""On Top of Old Smokey"" being sung in their home, I was enveloped by the lyrics of Steven Sondheim and couldn't get enough of such classics as ""I Feel Pretty"", ""Tonight"" and ""Gee, Officer Krupke!""For those not yet versed in the neo-expressionist masterpiece, West Side Story is the tale of two lovers; Maria (Wood) and Tony (Beymer) who simply cannot be together. Maria is the sister of Bernardo (Chakiris) the leader of a scrappy Puerto Rican gang in the heart of New York City. Meanwhile Tony is an enforcer and founding member of The Jets, a crew of native whites, descendant from Polish immigrants. Needless to say The Jets and The Sharks don't get along and plan a rumble over the turf they call home. Trying and failing to keep the piece are Detective Schrank (Oakland) and Officer Krupke (Bramley) who turn their noses at the youthful gangs and their aggressive street ballet.The film begins with aerial shots of New York City as ambient noise melts into the menacing finger snaps of gang members. The story struts slowly and confidently, draping the audience in the brightly colored world of Maria and Tony with an opening ballet so terse and tight it can't help but startle. The depth of field within the frame, along with the flashes of harsh lights, shadowed trestles and euphonious melody adds to the films attitude and fury. It's an aggressive musical with violent themes all centered around a love story that's sincere to a fault.Natalie Wood does an outstanding job channeling the frustrations and ecstasy of a young ingenue finding love for the first time. Richard Beymer is slightly miscast as the gallant beau who steals her heart yet his cornball bravado can be forgiven when matched by Russ Tamblyn's Jet caretaker manager Riff. The real heart of the show however is Rita Moreno as Anita, the sassy female guardian whose equal parts Frenchie from Grease (1978) and Mae West only 100% Puerto Rican (unlike Wood). Moreno can not only act but she can sing like a songbird and dance like she's treading on water. She ended up winning Best Supporting Actress at the Academy Awards for her portrayal and in the years since she gained distinction as an EGOT (someone whose won an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony).The dance numbers are a compendium of elastic, punchy fun with men and women flying through the air in graceful synergy. What penetrates through all the showy glitz however is an excess of feeling in all the numbers. Whether it be the sweaty paranoia of ""Cool"" or the sly, bittersweet social awareness of ""America"", the characters large and small all find little moments to exhibit pure personality. Granted some of the song and dance numbers may overstay their welcome, yet beyond the restless movement and admittedly dated lingo, there's a state of mind so raw, so real that it overpowers any of the film's minor missteps.An of course there is the social subtext which best represents itself in songs like ""America"" and ""Gee, Officer Krupke!"". Certainly there is a racial component to West Side Story, yet if we dig even deeper we find that all characters are trying to come to terms with an internal struggle for validation and acceptance. The Sharks distract themselves from the inner conflict with racial resentment, a conflict that is made real not only by The Jets but by Schrank who has no problems seeing them as ""the other."" Meanwhile The Jets overwhelm their resentments with mockery, not only openly dressing down Schrank and Krupke but even ridiculing their assumed hangups in song. One of the few moments of Jets honesty comes when Doc angrily chastises them for ""(making) this world lousy!"" One of the hoods responds ""We didn't make it, Doc."" It is at that moment we see that they have much more in common with The Sharks than they realize; they too feel invalidated by social systems.Taken as a whole, West Side Story is a layered, beautiful and bellicose film which dares to tell a familiar story with new story elements, exciting visuals and an infinity of blunt antagonism. Those who have yet to see this film should watch it on the largest screen possible to take full advantage of its epic scale and dense mis en scene. Those who find the inspiration for West Side Story to be too adroit, be aware the romance is laid on just as thick. Yet just because it can occasionally flirt with corniness doesn't mean it's no less a masterpiece.",West Side Story
71,LeonardKniffel,The Perfect Blend of Story and Music,10,29 April 2020,"If you've already seen this 1962 American musical classic, you might not remember that the central conflict in the movie is between the Puerto Ricans and the ""Polacks"" in New York. Played by Richard Beymer, Tony is the good-hearted Polish boy who falls in love with Maria, the good-hearted Puerto Rican girl played by Natalie Wood, setting off a gang war. Wood's voice is dubbed, once again by the great Marni Nixon, but she is otherwise perfect as Maria, singing ""I Feel Pretty."" The more I see this movie, however, the more I think it belongs to Rita Moreno, who sings the classics ""America"" and ""A Boy Like That"" with such passion that it is more relevant today than ever, applied to any ethnic group struggling to succeed in the land of liberty. Although true to the 1950s setting, much of the lingo and behavior was already considered corny when the movie came out, but a musical about ethnic warfare, in which street gangs leap about and sing revolutionized musical theater and cinema in countless ways. The music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim are as lovely today as the day they were written, especially ""Maria"" and ""Tonight."" ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013",West Side Story
72,jacobs-greenwood,"One of the great musicals, and an Oscar winning Best Picture among stiff competition",8,11 October 2016,"This updated Romeo and Juliet tale, on the streets of New York, is the only movie so far to share the Best Director Oscar between two directors, Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins (his film debut was also the only film he directed).After the Overture, the film opens fairly silently with breathtaking (helicopter high) overhead views of Manhattan before the camera is focused - and zooms in - on a city playground (where the story later ends). Director Wise would use virtually this exact same technique to open (and close) his other Oscar-winning Best Picture The Sound of Music (1965), which features the majestic Alps in place of the cement and steel 'mountains' of New York City.Two rival street gangs: Riff (Russ Tamblyn) is the leader of the ethnic ""White"" Jets, Bernardo (Chakiris) the leader of the ""Hispanic"" (actually, Puerto Rican) Sharks and brother of Maria (Natalie Wood); Moreno plays Maria's friend Anita, who is also Bernardo's girl. When Tony (Richard Beymer), who was formerly with the Jets, and Maria fall in love, there is conflict played out ever so creatively in song and dance, with Tamblyn lending his many skills in this area. Of course, their's is a forbidden love which can only lead to tragedy. Simon Oakland, Ned Glass, William Bramley (as Officer Krupke) and John Astin play the adult supporting roles.The film won 10 (out of 11 nominations) total Oscars including Best Picture and both Supporting roles, George Chakiris and Rita Moreno (who also uniquely has an Emmy, a Grammy, and a Tony Award as well!).

73,guy-bellinger,Still breathtaking after so many years...,10,8 October 2004,"I've just seen ""West Side Story"" again. For the seventh time to be accurate !Of course, when I sat down in front of the screen I told myself I should not be surprised if I was a little letdown as the film would certainly have lost some of its edge. Only natural when -like me- you know the slightest details of its plot like the back of your hand.Well, I was wrong. And all the happier for that. As a matter of fact, Robbins and Wise's masterpiece once again interested me - made me laugh - caused me to sob - moved me - thrilled me - upset me -resonated and vibrated in me. Quite an amazing phenomenon for sure. That's why I started wondering what had made this prodigy possible. And here is the result of these interrogations ( although I am not at all certain that RATIONALES can faithfully translate EMOTIONS ) : - The social comment is at the same time relevant, witty and still valid today. As an English teacher I regularly use ""America"" and ""Gee, officer Krupke"" as documents for the class and no student has ever complained about them being outdated. - The musical numbers are brilliant, original, wonderfully filmed and danced. - the score constitutes a powerful mix of rock and classical music and although the tunes are very familiar to your ears, you still note the modernity of the arrangements, the subtlety of the orchestration and the catchy rhythm of most songs. - the settings are slightly stylized, which makes them more timeless and meaningful. Drab greys and Aggressive reds vie to win the rumble ! - the editing is absolutely sensational : I had never forgotten Bernardo's fist hitting a blood red brick wall underscored by a sudden accent of music and I experienced the same physical shock this time around. - Riff and Bernardo are superbly portrayed by Tamblyn and Chakiris : why on earth didn't they become stars ?My only disappointment ( but is perfection of this world? ) is the choice of Richard Beymer. Not that he is a bad actor. It is only a matter of physical appearance. He looks too clean, too much of ""the-right-guy-next-door-you-would-love-your-daughter-to-marry"" to be credible as a former bad boy.Whatever the case may be, I am ready for the eighth screening and I am not afraid at the prospect any more !",West Side Story
74,bobsgrock,Art at its highest form.,9,14 August 2008,"No matter what anyone says, West Side Story is art at its highest form and undoubtedly one of the ten greatest musicals ever made. With a running time like an epic, an opening overture with incredible music and sets that will blow your mind, this is an over-the top rendition of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet that works on nearly every level. It all starts with the actors, and while most of them can't sing, they look very good on camera and pull some pretty nifty physical moves as well. Natalie Wood, Richard Beymer and Russ Tamblyn all provide strong performances even if they seem a little off balance. However, the finest performances come from the Latino lovers; George Charkris and Rita Moreno. Together they have hotter chemistry than most American actors and separate they give strong work as two people that love each other yet let other factors get in their way.To be frank, this is a film that cinema-wise is near perfection. Robert Wise directs flawlessly, Jerome Robbin's choreography is absolutely stunning and the score by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim will stay with you long after the film ends. Some people think it's overrated and others think it's just okay. In this viewer's opinion, it is near-perfect and a wonderful look at racial relationships mixed with beautiful music.",West Side Story
75,Jeremy_Urquhart,One of the best musicals of all time (and worth a watch even if you don't usually like the genre),9,26 April 2020,"I remember seeing the opening scene of West Side Story on TV when I was about 11 or 12. It was one of the funniest, cheesiest, dumbest things I'd ever seen at the time. I laughed and chuckled and carried on about the fact that these supposedly tough street gangs were having dance-offs and clicking their fingers at each other, instead of shooting, stabbing, and beating each other up.Of course I didn't have the patience to continue watching to find out that the stakes were indeed raised at a certain point, and that the actions of some characters did become much more violent. But checking the movie out about a decade later allowed me to be mature enough to get past that opening scene... which yes, on paper, is still kind of funny. I wasn't laughing as much at it on my recent rewatch as I did when I was about 20, and I didn't laugh at it as much at 20 as I had at 12. But it is jarring. It is unexpected. It is unashamedly theatrical and over the top and yeah, it's odd. Laughing at it is a perfectly normal way of responding to it, I guess.But get past that scene (or just appreciate it for the way it's shot, paced, and the physical prowess of the actors on display) and you'll be treated to another 2 and a bit hours of stunningly colourful cinematography, great music, compelling performances across the board, a well-paced (if somewhat familiar) story, and a surprising amount of emotional heft in its second half. Maybe the opening scene is intentionally theatrical so that when the story does inevitably get more ""real,"" it just hits harder.This is an iconic musical for so many reasons, and to go into too great detail would just be spoiling it. It's something you need to experience and truly feel for yourself; it's particularly difficult to put into words.Sure, the fact that Natalie Wood isn't Puerto-Rican is a bit yikes by today's standards, and technically, the story could have a scene or two trimmed here and there. And yeah, it borrows heavily from Romeo and Juliet- though if it counts as a Romeo and Juliet adaptation, it may as well be my favourite, and it's certainly better than Baz Luhrmann's contemporary ""cool"" update of the play from the late 90s (although I will admit, that movie's still pretty good too).Even if you're not a big musical person, I still think this is worth a shot. If you can't get into this one, then there's a good chance that most other musicals of its type, age and style won't be for you. But it's got well above average songs and dancing, as well as a story with some actual emotional weight and genuine stakes, which makes it more interesting and compelling to watch than a great number of other more light-hearted, low stakes musicals out there (though they're not without merit too- Singing in the Rain and An American in Paris are particularly good, when it comes to classic Hollywood musicals, in my opinion).So if you haven't seen this yet, without a doubt watch it. It's pretty close to a masterpiece, with only some minor flaws here and there. Not sure it needs a remake that's apparently coming out by the end of the year, but Spielberg surely must have a good reason for telling such a familiar story again... right?
One can hope at least.",West Side Story
76,proud_luddite,Mostly Brilliant,9,20 December 2020,"This classic musical updates the 'Romeo and Juliet' story. The lovers are linked with rival street gangs in New York City - one white, the other Puerto Rican.There is so much to praise in this film. The dance numbers and the songs are truly among the best. When they are combined (some dance numbers are instrumental only), there is true magic especially with the number "" America "".The film doesn't quite get an excellent rating due to the uneven performances from the leads (whose singing voices were dubbed). Natalie Wood is fine in the dramatic scenes (especially at the heart-gripping end) but she is not always consistent with her Puerto Rican accent. Richard Beymer is less consistent and seems miscast. The supporting performances fare better including Rita Moreno (dubbed voice but sharp acting and dancing), George Chakiris (no singing but great acting and dancing) and Russ Tamblyn (a triple threat all around).The on-location shooting and the great classic songs (especially ""Something's Coming"", ""Maria"", ""Tonight"", ""Gee Officer Krupke"", ""America"", ""I Feel Pretty"", ""One Hand, One Heart"", ""I Have a Love"", and of course, ""Somewhere"") make this a film for multiple viewings.

It advertised two gangs going at it and me and my two pals thought..wow, lets give this a look. It starts out decent enough until one of the Jets does a ballerina move and I squirmed in my seat. Since when do gangs dance around town? Got past that to finally understand the message and how it was presented too. Seen it 30 times since then and will see it again.

78,jhclues,The Best of the Best,10,26 November 2001,"Those who have nothing will do everything in their power to protect it, even if all they have is territory, in which case they will claim ownership by planting a metaphorical flag in the middle of it and marking the boundaries.  And, forever after, anyone invading their `turf' had better have a good reason, because within this imaginary domain a peer status is also established, and to some-- especially the ones at the top of the pyramid-- this becomes all they have or will ever hope to have in their entire lives.  But there is one thing that will ultimately, at least for some, supersede this delusional monarchy, and that thing is universal: Love.  Which is exactly what happens when a young couple from different sides of the street fall in love, in the landmark musical `West Side Story,' directed by Robert Wise, with staging and choreography by Jerome Robbins. The streets of New York City are the setting for this contemporary version of Shakespeare's `Romeo and Juliet,' the drama of which plays out within the confines of a microcosmic world which encompasses a sparse few city blocks and is ruled by rival gangs, the Jets and the Sharks, who are constantly vying for territory and whose soul purpose in life is protecting their turf. Tony (Richard Beymer) is a former Jet, once one of their leaders, in fact, but has left it all behind in an attempt to get on with his life.  His best friend, Riff (Russ Tamblyn), however, is still the leader of the Jets, who are currently embroiled in their ongoing fight with the Sharks.  Maria (Natalie Wood) is Puerto Rican, and her brother, Bernardo (George Chakiris) is the leader of the Sharks.  And when circumstances bring Tony and Maria together and they fall in love, it sets the stage for tragedy on a grand scale, all of which is captured on the screen in this film, the most celebrated musical of all time.	When a movie earns ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director (Jerome Robbins also received a special award for choreography), it clearly indicates that this is a film of extraordinary merit.  And this one is-- by anyone's measuring stick.  Told through the magic of music, presented through the dramatic and driving Oscar winning songs and score of Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim, Shakespeare's tragic love story becomes a transporting, memorable experience that is at once a sweeping visual extravaganza while at the same time an intimate chronicle of the romance between the star-crossed lovers, Tony and Maria.  Lavishly staged, the film evokes a true 1950's sensibility while retaining the agelessness of the passion at the heart of the story.  The production numbers are dynamic, from the quietude of the enthralling and poignant `Maria,' and the perky, uplifting `I Feel Pretty,' to the energetic `Dance At The Gym' and the thundering, dramatic strains which accompany the rumble.  This is an example of filmmaking at it's best, brought to fruition through the talents of Wise, Robbins and a superlative cast and crew, whose many and varied individual contributions are too lengthy to mention here.	This may not have been Natalie Wood's greatest role, but she is nevertheless unforgettable as Maria.  She is charming and beautiful, with riveting, dark eyes that speak volumes about her character.  Her accent is passable, if not perfect, but most importantly her natural ability as an actor enables her to create a very real, believable person in Maria. There's an endearing vulnerability about her, yet in her eyes you find the pride and determination that makes Maria strong.  It's a solid performance, and just one of the many reasons this film was so well received.	This was without question Richard Beymer's day in the sun, career-wise, and his portrayal of Tony is credible, but fairly lackluster.  If a weakness in the film could be singled out, it would be his performance; still, he does well enough, but in the end his work here is average, to say the very best. As his buddy, Riff, Russ Tamblyn comes across much better, and makes the most of showcasing his considerable talents in what is one of his most memorable roles, as well.	The performances that really steal the show, however, are turned in by George Chakiris as Bernardo, and Rita Moreno as Maria's friend, Anita; both of whom deservedly received Oscars in the Best Supporting categories for their work here.  Chakiris, with his dark, good looks has never been more convincing or better in any role, and he has a commanding presence especially in the production numbers.  And Moreno is in a class all her own as the fiery Anita; she dominates the screen whenever she is on, especially during the dance at the gym and in the rousing `America.'  She is such a vital presence in this film, and along with Chakiris, more than helps in bringing the music and story to life.  	Also in supporting roles that add so much to this film and demand to be singled out, are Tony Mordente, as Action; Tucker Smith, as Ice; David Winters, as Arab; and Eliot Feld, as Baby John.  	The additional supporting cast includes Simon Oakland (Lieutenant Schrank), Ned Glass (Doc), William Bramley (Officer Krupke), Bert Michaels (Snowboy), Susan Oakes (Anybodys), Gina Trikonis (Graziella), Carole D'Andrea (Velma) Jose De Vega (Chino), Jay Norman (Pepe) and Gus Trikonis (Indio).  An emotionally involving story underscored by a blood-stirring soundtrack, `West Side Story' is without question one of the all time great movie musicals, thoroughly entertaining and presented with the kind of flare that is rarely even attempted anymore.  Within the genre, it's the best of the best, the realized vision of a group of extraordinary artists.  Earning Oscars, as well, for Cinematography, Costumes, Art and Set Direction and editing, this is a prime example of the true magic of the movies.  I rate this one 10/10.",West Side Story

West Side Story was adapted from the Broadway musical by Arthur Laurents and Jerome Robbins which won two of it's six Tony Award nominations for 1958 for choreographer Jerome Robbins and Scenic Designer Oliver Smith.

Robbins detail on transposing the musical to film along with the skill of film maker Wise made this a classic but it's the excellent songs of Leonard Berstein and Stephen Sondheim and the masterful film scoring of their songs by the team of Chaplin, Green, Ramin and Kostel that gives this film the lifeblood that endures across the decades.

80,DarthBill,Story on the West Side,10,29 April 2004,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Possibly the greatest musical ever told retells the ""Romeo & Juliet"" scenario for the late 50s/early 60s era of youthful teenagers.Set in said era (late 50s, early 60s), two NY based gangs of street teens - the white gang known as the Jets and the Hispanic gang known as the Sharks,battle each other time and time again for the right to rule the streets, much to the annoyance of the local cops. The Jets leader, Riff (Russ Tamblyn) has hadenough and decides to challenge the Sharks leader, Bernardo (GeorgeChakiris) at the local nightly dance to one last brawl (or ""rumble"") to settle things permanently. For support, Riff asks his best pal and co-founder of the Jets, Tony (Richard Beymer), who has been growing away from the gang and hero of ourmusical, to come along and Tony reluctantly agrees for old times sake, but he's got a feeling that there's something much bigger in store for him.
Enter Maria (the late Natalie Wood), Bernardo's little sister. Maria is a bit naive about the ugly side of America, partly because she's young and partly because Bernardo won't let her go out anywhere. Well, he brings her to the dance with his girlfriend Anita (Rita Moreno) and his chosen suitor for Maria, Chino, and at the dance, among the frenzied dancing, Maria spots Tony and vice versa. Theresult: love/lust at first sight. Tony and Maria try to carry on a secret affair while their friends, family and peers clash with each other over the relative pros and cons of American life and battle for the right to hold the street. Things take an ugly turn when Maria asks Tony to stop the rumble to protect Bernardo and Tony (being as stupid as he is) tries to, but the result is that a fight breaks out between Bernardo and Riff which ends in Riff's accidental death at Bernardo's hands.Enraged, Tony grabs Riff's knife and stabs Bernardo and all Hell breaks loose before the gangs are driven off from under the highway by the sound of sirens.Maria learns the truth from Chino and later from Tony. She forgives him and they plot to run away while the Jets new leader, Ice (Tucker Smith) advises them on how to stay calm under the pressure. Then a tomboy tells the Jets that Chino's out to kill Tony and the Jets try to protect Tony. Maria manages to win thesympathy of Anita for her plight and gets Anita to go give Tony a message at the drug store he works at, but the Jets won't let her through and get a little too rough with her. After being rescued by Tony's boss Doc, Anita lies that Maria is dead, which leads Tony on a suicide binge until he sees Maria from across the playground, thinking at first that it's only in his mind. But when he realizes that its her, they run to each other but Tony is gunned down by Chino. After Tony'stouching death, Maria curses the stunned members of both gangs for theirpettiness and cruelty towards each other. Members from both gangs pick upTony's body and carry it away while Chino is arrested and Maria follows them, heart broken but hopeful.Yeah they took some liberties with the play, but this is a damn great film.

81,harry-76,Problems with Authur,5,4 September 2002,"It may a trifle late in the day to criticize this popular work, but I've always had problems with it, and continue to do so. Since it's been so widely hailed and lauded, I admit to now feeling a little guilty about my negative feelings. Nonetheless, they still persist.On a personal note, I had the pleasure of residing in mid-Manhattan, New York City, between 1956 and 1961.  The whole time I was there, I read or heard nothing of the ""ethnic problems"" that the ""Jets and Sharks"" act out in Authur Laurent's play. As far as I know, the Puerto Ricans and ""Anglos"" got along just fine.  While there may have been an occasional minor skirmish between a few individuals in certain Bronx or lower Manhattan neighborhoods, they were rare, isolated incidents, which hardly made press.Therefore, it was a bit of a start to see Laurents use these quite compatible real-life groups as ""dramatic foil"" for his ""Montague-Capulet"" counterparts in his ""Romeo"" mod treatment.  I still recall sitting in the audience the third week after ""West Side"" premiered on stage at the Winter Garden Theater on Broadway, and being rather repelled by what Laurents had done in terms of ""ethnic exploitation."" Frankly, I didn't like that particular element at all, in spite of its admittedly brilliant over-all production. (It also was awkward for me, in that I happened to personally knew a number of the dance-cast members from their studying ballet at the June Taylor Dance School a few blocks away.)When this work was transferred to film, I again saw it shortly after it opened in a Broadway movie house with gigantic screen and booming stereo. Of course, the productional effects were overwhelming--yet that annoying ""exploitation element"" persisted--and does so to this day.As far as I'm concerned, there was never nor is now little or no basis in reality for the depiction of the ""Jets and Sharks"" in terms of these particular ethnic groups, in New York City or its boroughs.  As a result, I've never completely ""bought"" the fundamental premise of Laurent's ""Shakespeare updating.""  Thus, my appreciation of ""West Side Story"" continues to be decidedly diminished.",West Side Story
82,gab-14712,"An Excellent Musical Retelling of ""Romeo and Juliet!""",9,2 August 2020,"How on earth did I miss the juggernaut of a musical, West Side Story? As soon as the aerial footage of New York City came on the screen, I was drawn in and captured by the magic of this excellent musical. Funnily enough, I knew a majority of the songs (such as ""I Feel Pretty"") but I never associated them with this production of course. At two-and-a-half hours, the movie flew by because it has a fast tempo. I became enamored with the characters on both sides of the rival gang war and I felt for them despite their differences. The music is fantastic! You cannot have a great musical without excellent songs and dance!The film was adapted to the screen by the great screenwriter Ernest Lehman. Prior to the film, the story was a bestselling novel from Arthur Laurents and was a huge success on Broadway thanks to the talents of Jerome Robbins. Robert Wise, a much-respected studio veteran, came on to direct this adaptation. Because he lacked the skills and experience in this genre, he hired Robbins as a co-director. Wise would direct the dramatic scenes and Robbins was in charge of the music and choreography. Robbins was eventually fired because he could not stop directing which resulted in a ballooning budget. Wise still kept in touch and relied upon him in the editing room. The choreography is the best thing about the movie, along with the music and expert editing. The music was not used to move the plot. The songs and dance seemed like their own ambience. A different story within the same story. That is what makes the editing so good. The scene where Maria and Tony meet each other for the first time? Check that sequence out if you want a masterclass in editing and lighting techniques.As a NYC resident, I happily recognized many of the shooting locations (present day Lincoln Center). Perhaps another reason why I felt so close to the movie. This story is a version of the tragic Shakespeare story, Romeo & Juliet. Some changes were made, but the basic idea is present. If you are familiar with this tale, then you will understand why the emotions are flooding when the credits roll. The feuding families are now the Sharks and the Jets. The European-based Jets led by Riff (Russ Tamblyn) versus the Puerto Rican Sharks led by Bernardo (George Chakiris). The two rival gangs hate each other to the point where they are willing to spill blood for control of the streets. That cannot stop Riff's best friend Tony (Richard Beymer) falling in love with Bernardo's sister Maria (Natalie Wood). Also, an undeniable force is Bernardo's lover Anita (Rita Moreno).Some people I associate with say the movie is boring because all it is people snapping their fingers and walking down the street. I felt it added to the musical flow of the performances. Speaking of which, solid to excellent performances all around. Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood were good in their respective roles and showed they had excellent chemistry. The winners are Rita Moreno and George Chakiris, both of whom won Academy Awards for their roles. Their chemistry was absolute fire! Just watch their sequence during the song ""America."" I do wish the roles of the Sharks were given to authentic Puerto Ricans, but this film was released in 1961 so keep that in mind.As sung in the aforementioned song, ""America,"" the film holds itself to a high degree of relevance in today's world. Just like fifty years ago, the Latinos or any non-white group want a better life for themselves. They were promised a world of freedom when compared to their home countries and came to America to search for it. Whether or not they found it is a whole different story. That song really stuck out to me. All of the songs are excellent and choreographed perfectly.Overall, West Side Story is an excellent musical thanks to the song and dance routines from Jerome Robbins. The dialogue itself is decent, but not up to par with the usual standard from Ernest Lehman. The film won ten Academy Awards and cemented itself in the canons of best musicals ever made. Robert Wise and Ernest Lehman would team up several years later to produce The Sound of Music. I implore film fans to watch this if you have not done so already. It is not only an excellent musical, but an intellectual one.My Grade: A-",West Side Story

84,Rogue-32,"Mythic, epic, timeless",10,22 January 2008,"There are certain films which absolutely demand to be seen in an actual movie theatre, toweringly majestic films that are profoundly diminished without the contribution of the big screen experience - films such as Gone With the Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, The Ten Commandments, Ben Hur, and more recently, films such as The French Lieutenant's Woman, The English Patient, Peter Jackson's remake of King Kong, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, etc. I've watched movies on my TV screen at home, in fact, that made me wish I had experienced them in a theatre - The Unbearable Lightness of Being springs to mind; I remember watching it and imagining the entire time what it would have been like in a theatre. Fortunately, one of the films that I did have the thrill of seeing the way it was meant to be experienced, in all its larger-than-lifeness, on the big screen, is West Side Story.This movie changed my life, plain and simple. I was born and raised in NYC, where the film takes place, but I was never a fan of musicals, on screen or in plays - it just seemed ridiculous to me when people would burst into song at the laundromat, say, and while it's true that yer basic street gang doesn't exactly perform brilliantly choreographed dance numbers in their neighborhood playground, today or at any other time in history, in West Side Story it works, it makes sense, you're swept along into the reality of the piece effortlessly. Because of the dazzlingly flawless execution of the material, West Side Story transcends.I was fortunate enough to see the film in an actual theatre, more than once, and I've seen it at home as well - when I first broke down and bought a DVD player a few years back a friend of mine, knowing of my deep connection to this movie, got me a copy (widescreen, of course). It took me weeks and weeks to finally put it in and attempt to watch it because I didn't want my memory of the experience to be tarnished - in fact I secretly thought it was almost blasphemous to watch such a exquisite masterpiece on a TV screen. I was pleasantly surprised, then, to find out that the film actually plays very well in this format.It's the story, the overwhelming emotion of the story, that comes through, ultimately, and while it obviously doesn't have the added dimension of the movie theatre experience, this timeless classic can be seen and appreciated at home. Allow me to rephrase an old adage : 'Tis better to have seen it small than never to have seen it at all.",West Side Story
85,jem132,Romeo And Juliet Take To The Streets In This Musical Adaptation,9,23 April 2006,"With 21 pages of comments on IMDb, there isn't really much that hasn't been said about 'West Side Story'. It's an exhilarating film experience, flawed, yes, but otherwise fabulous.The film is daring in it's approach. From the time the credits roll and we see the slowly changing colour sequence backed up only by the musical score, we know we are in for a different kind of musical. It is one in where tough street hoods can inexplicably move like ballet dancers. It is one in which fighting and violence is more like poetry than anything else. It is one musical where we don't get our requisite happy ending.Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer star as the modern-day Romeo and Juliet characters of the piece, Maria and Tony. One has to suspend belief when viewing Wood as a Puerto Rican. She's been coloured up by make-up, and tries on an accent for size, yet her All-American girl next door quality cannot be hidden. Still, she turns in a very good performance as the emotionally torn Maria. Her singing is dubbed, as is Beymer's, but it's her heart we care about most. Her and Tony meet and, as in Shakespeare's tale, it is love at first sight. The problem is, she's Puerto Rican and her brother is a member of the Shark street gang, and Tony is white and associates with the Jets. We know it will all end in tragedy, but that doesn't infringe on the enjoyable experience 'West Side Story' is.Technically, it's brilliant. The song and dance numbers are perfectly choreographed, and it's never anything but confident in it's approach. Perhaps a little too confident. Some of the sequences are frustratingly long and slow the action, and the film does drag considerably in places. The emotional impact of 'West Side Story' is never in doubt though. We feel for these lovers who cannot be together because of unnecessary racial boundaries. The film is even more poignant as the same racial boundaries, sadly, still exist today.Fine support is given by Russ Tamblyn, George Chakiris and Rita Moreno (the last two won Oscars for their performances). This is not the best musical ever made (IMO, 'Singin In The Rain' takes that lofty honour), but it is up there with the finest.",West Side Story

It is simply not very good and it portrays a world so dimension less and cardboard that it often hovers on the point of silliness. The only thing it has going for it has going for it are classic songs and lively dance numbers.Let me tell you my chief beef - it portrays a world of the ghetto from a snobbish and middle-class view point (the very people that vote for the Oscars). The real NY Westside was melting pot and mixed relationships were common. The world here makes South African apartheid look like a Utopian society!Let us not stay too long on the acting - has the lead in a ""classic"" movie (Richard Beymer as Tony) ever made a worse impression? And he had to have his singing voice dubbed. Great casting. A blacked-up Natalie Wood is wooden too and she has her voice dubbed by real vocal talent as well. Did I hear someone say Milli Vanilli?

90,elvircorhodzic,"""Why do you kids live like there's a war on?!""",7,15 April 2017,"WEST SIDE STORY is a musical crime drama, which is a good blend of a dance and music in the shadow of a conflict between two gangs.The tension, between a white American gang, the Jets, and a Puerto Rican gang, the Sharks, grows day by day. Policemen prevent larger conflicts. The Jets decide to challenge the Sharks to a rumble for neighborhood control, at an upcoming dance. Their leader, Riff, decides to call his best friend, Tony, who has left a gang, in a battle. However, Tony is uninterested. At the dance, the gangs and girls refuse to intermingle. Tony still arrives at the dance and falls in love with Maria, the sister of Bernardo, who is a leader of a rival gang. Bernardo angrily demands Tony to stay away from her. Later, Tony discreetly visits Maria on her fire escape, where they reaffirm their love. Across the street, gangs determines the time and place of the final clash...A dance, rhythm and a wild energy are the most memorable segments in this film. Every movement is a pure poetry. This is more than a street dance and emotional songs. This is a game between love and hate. Love is innocent and touching, but hatred is far more passionate and more intensive in this story. Immigrant issues are, in some way mitigated through a dance and songs. A serious drama about racial intolerance is completely inappropriate in this film. Directors have scratched topics related to immigration, freedom, patriarchy, delinquency and religion. The protagonists are only young offenders which have some of their disagreements. That is, given the background of the story and the Shakespeare tragedy, rather frivolous.Natalie Wood as Maria Nunez is an innocent girl who believes in an unconditional love. She is a charming character, who shows her acting power in the second part of the film. Richard Beymer as Tony Wyzek is a young man, who is part of a ""street culture"", but he's trying to grow up. His appearance, despite of a poor characterization, is quite interesting. Chemistry is not particularly strong between these two characters.Rita Moreno as Anita, Bernardo's girlfriend, is a young woman who is torn between two worlds. George Chakiris as Bernardo Nunez is the most dominant phenomenon in the film. His character is composed of a mad pride and an unquestionable tradition. Chemistry is, in their case, really incredible.This is an energetic and exotic dance story, which turns into a cult and tragic spectacle.",West Side Story
91,Isaac5855,A Timeless Musical Masterpiece,10,3 August 2006,"WEST SIDE STORY is the 1961 film version of the landmark 1955 Broadway musical that updated Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET to the turbulent urban gang scene of Manhattan's west side that follows the romance between Puerto Rican Maria (Natalie Wood) and Polish Tony (Richard), which is framed against the battles between two rival gangs in the neighborhood, the Puerto Rican sharks and the Caucasian Jets, who are in constant, dangerous conflict over absolute rule over a small area of a west side neighborhood. Co-directors Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins have constructed a nearly perfect musical here, which offers everything Broadway fans want from a musical and also offers a meaty story that could appeal to non-musical fans as well. The score, by Leonard Bernstein (music) and Stephen Sondheim (lyrics) has almost become part of musical folklore: ""Tonight"",""America"",""I Feel Pretty"",""Somewhere"", ""One Hand, One Heart"", almost all of which have become individual classics in their own right and each is an integral part of the story that helps to flesh out characters and advance plot. The cast is first rate, despite the fact that none of the leads do their own singing. Natalie Wood still makes a lovely Maria (singing dubbed by Marni Nixon)and Rita Moreno and George Chakiris light up the screen in their Oscar winning supporting turns as Anita and Bernardo, Maria's best friend and brother, who is leader of the Sharks. Russ Tamblyn is athletic and charismatic as Riff, the Jets' leader and Tony's best friend. Richard Beymer is a little too limp-wristed as Tony, but his singing is superbly dubbed by Jimmy Bryant. But the real star of this film is the dance. Never before was the art of dance used to such brilliant effect to advance the plot of a story. The entire opening of the film, introducing the conflict between the Jets and Sharks is done completely in dance and perfectly conveys the tension between the two gangs. Co-director and choreographer Jerome Robbins has mounted some of the most amazing dancing ever seen on the silver screen. The opening, as well as the dance at the gym, ""America"" and ""Cool"" are absolutely dazzling dance numbers. This film swept the '61 Oscars, winning 10 awards, including Best Picture. No musical had ever won that many Oscars and it is doubtful that it will ever happen again. A once in a lifetime motion picture experience that all film buffs, especially musical buffs, should study and cherish and revel in.",West Side Story
92,Darkside-Reviewer,Changed my opinion about musicals,9,30 April 2021,"I personally have never had much interest in musicals both on stage performances and in movies. The idea of a bunch of people dancing around to songs that I have little to no interest in just never appealed to me especially given my love of heavy metal and gothic style bands. I am however a huge movie buff owning a ridiculous amount of Blu Rays and DVDs. The older I get the more my taste in movies seems to change and evolve which in recent years has led to me watching more classic films from the 60s and 70s. West Side Story (1961) is a film that has been recommended to me many times by many friends and in many forums even when I was at school my English teachers kept telling me to watch West Side Story.After finally watching West Side Story I can honestly say that I regret not watching it sooner. I went into this movie expecting a lot of overly flamboyant dance numbers performed by a bunch of do gooders from the 1950s. To my surprise I found myself enjoying the movie's catchy and memorable songs that I couldn't get out of my head for days on end. The dance choreography is visually stunning to watch I was honestly very impressed with how well the actors managed to stay in sync throughout an entire song performance with very minimal camera cutaways. I can see why West Side Story is considered to be one of the greatest on screen musicals of all time.I wasn't aware before watching West Side Story that the movies theme and story was heavily inspired by Shakespeares classic play Romeo & Juliet. Romeo & Juliet has always been one my all time favourite books. I personally enjoyed West Side Story's ""modern"" interpretation of Shakespeares classic. A tragic tale of love and loss blended together brilliantly with a modern day story about gangs, poverty, violence and racism, a tragic tale all it's own. The theme's depicted in West Side Story remain very relevant even in today's modern society.There is currently a remake of West Side Story being made in 2021 which may turn out to be a great film, only time will tell. However if history is anything to go by remakes of classic films often turn out terrible. West Side Story is a one of kind film that isn't without it's flaws and modern day controversies, however the film remains as one of the most beloved on screen musicals of all time.",West Side Story
93,silverscreen888,Most Unusual Musical: a Dance Adventure cum Love Story; Exciting,7,23 June 2005,"This is a very strange film from a very unstrange theatrical work. Everyone knows how ""Romeo and Juliet"", a well-written but Medievally gloomy Shakespearean tragedy, was adapted for ""West Side Story"". The locale was moved from Northern Italy to New York City; the Montagues' and Capulets' servants and relatives were transformed into Euro-Ethnic Versus Puerto Rican youth gangs; and Romeo and Juliet became Tony and Maria. The basic premise probably seems interesting; the original play stressed the baselessness of the quarrel, the hot-blooded youth of the participants and the swiftness with which attachments were formed. In the play, also, a strong injunction was put onto the two sides in the ""war"" by authorities--and this is missing here. This I suggest is the dramatic key to why ""Romeo and Juliet"" is more violent than ""West Side Story""--because to do what they do, the youth in Verona have to defy a strong edict. Lacking this, the rival gangs here only slowly escalate their quarrel to an artificial climax. The other odd element here is ""dance""; the idea of stylizing human action as dance in a musical is one that has very seldom been tried. The fluid choreography by Jerome Robbins works well here for the most part; the use of real New York streets etc. permits a reality to play against--much as shadows may be thrown onto a prepared wall perfect for seeing them as outward shapes hinting at something more inward. The credit for the film's pace and power go to Ernest Lehman, Jerome Robbins and Arthur Laurents for the adaptation of the original play; to Robert Wise and Robbins for the direction; to Irene Sharaff for her costumes and Daniel L. Fapp for luminous cinematography. Among the huge, largely spear-carriers or dancers participating cast, acting honors go to Rita Moreno, Simon Oakland, William Bramley, Ned Glass Natalie Wood, and Susan Oaks as ""Anybodys""; Russ Tamblyn and George Chakiris do well; no one else is particularly good except Tony Mordente. But they do not have to be; they are playing young people, meaning they need intelligence, energy and purpose, and these are supplied by all concerned in abundant measure. Songs such as ""Tonight"", ""Somewhere"", ""The Jets' Ballet"", ""Maria"", ""America"", ""I Feel Pretty"", ""Your Love is Your Love""and others have become famous; and the film won many nominations. It is innovative in many ways, engrossing, captivating, and occasionally not-too-well-acted. But the essence of the film is motion, I assert, and seldom has movement been used so effectively in any film in my judgment. A+ for effort is the least one can give any aspect of this unusual movie. The music by Leonard Bernstein carries the day, always interesting and never dull; and the lyrics by Stephen Sondheim are terrifically on target. This is a musical whose emotional appeal is perhaps very hard to resist.",West Side Story

Granted, it may be a bit hard to believe teenage hoodlums would break into song at any time.  But the movie gives a lot of eye candy, at least before things turn serious towards the end of the story.  Some camera tricks are employed to convey emotion, and interpret some stage-to-screen passages.  Also, some excellent performances are turned in by Natalie Wood, as Maria, and Rita Moreno as Anita.

97,oOoBarracuda,West Side Story,9,29 March 2016,"West Side Story accomplished two goals for me. As a modern day adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, it fit quite nicely among the month featuring Shakespeare films. The musical directed by Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise was also selected by the Academy as 1961's Best Picture Winner. I have been on a years-long quest to see every film that has taken Oscar's top prize, and West Side Story starring Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer put me one step closer to accomplishing my goal. I'm sure I'm not alone in my assessment that this story of forbidden love ranks as the best retelling of Shakespeare's most well-known classic. Setting the Bard's prose to music was an excellent choice, as West Side Story remains cherished in the hearts of audiences everywhere. In this retelling of Romeo and Juliet, feuding families have been replaced with rival gangs, as the American ""Jets"" set out to stake their claim of the neighborhood from the Puerto Rican-born Sharks. Riff (Russ Tamblyn) acts as the leader of the Jets determined to keep the neighborhood free from the Puerto Rican immigrants he believes are taking over the neighborhood. Bernardo, leader of the Sharks, is equally determined to assimilate into the neighborhood and carve out a place for his friends and family seeking better lives in America. As the animosity intensifies, the hatred between the two groups escalates to the point that they can no longer exist safely. At a neighborhood dance, the groups attend to plan a fight for later in the evening. Bernardo's sister, Maria (Natalie Wood) is thrilled to be going to her first dance in America. As she dresses for the evening, she is anxiously awaiting the opportunity to meet people and dance the night away, always under the watchful eye of her brother. Riff talks former Jet Tony (Richard Beymer) to go to the dance, and suit up for the Jets one last time and help them fight the Sharks. Eager to leave the gang behind, Tony denies Riff's request to fight but succumbs to the pressure to go to the dance. At the dance, Maria and Tony lock eyes, instantly fall in love and ignite a passionate secret romance. Eager to move away from the gang life and begin their lives anew with each other Maria and Tony devise a plan to leave New York which will only work if they can keep their love hidden long enough to run off together. With each gang honing in on the secret, Tony and Maria are in a race against time and proximity ending in tragedy for the forbidden lovers.West Side Story wastes no time letting the audience know it is a musical. Nearly fifteen minutes into the film, no dialogue is heard, but a beautiful bird's-eye view shot is seen with a catchy musical number being heard in the background. The tone is intense with scenes characterized with flash cuts and stark lighting changes. This film plays with coloring in a very interesting way. One scene, in particular; the initial meeting of Tony and Maria, the background goes dark and the audience is only left to see the two would be lovers. After the dance we see another scene with the forefront blurred and an ominous image of Riff in the background, an excellent use of foreshadowing. West Side Story is a fantastically done musical, with memorable fun songs, endured in hearts for over the last 50 years.",West Side Story

Tamblyn is just great - athletic and balletic at the same time. Chakiris is spot on as Bernardo and Rita Moreno gives the best performance of her life in WSS. The direction, the music(oh the music!!) and the genius lyrics just could not have been better. I saw this as a kid in the 60's and have seen it dozens of times since. it still blows me away. Particular highlights are the ""America"" number, ""Gee Officer Krupke"" and ""the Rumble"" sequence. What never ceases to amaze me is how relevant it still is.

it's a beautifully choreographed, edited and directed movie with a simple theme and linear screenplay. The movie is romantic, brutal and sad, depicting the young blood, searching for identity and glory.What did not work:
acting was theatrical and overly done,maybe to align to the musical narrative. I think without the musicals the movie would have been cut by 40%.

The movie itself is based on the book of the same name.Elvis was actually approached to come and play the role of Tony but he turned it down and opted for other musicals. If Elvis had known that this movie will be set in the range of classics to be seen maybe he would have picked the offer.The movie tells the story of two rival gangs, the Jets (Americans) and the Sharks (Puerto Ricans). The jets decide to challenge the Sharks for who takes control of the streets at a dance that night. Riff the leader decides to call Tony Wycek (Richard Beymer), a co-founder of the Jets who has left the gang to work at a local candy/drug store, would be the best member to present the challenge to the Sharks.At the dance that night Tony gets there and meets Maria (Natalie Wood) and it was love at first sight. Tony gets carried away by her presence and everything else from here I need you the reader to go watch it yourself.The movie still has its marks in Hollywood, as some of the songs are still being used, and also in the Michael Jackson Bad video the standoff between the rival gang leaders is similar to that in the movie.The film holds the distinction of being the musical film with the most Academy Award wins (10 wins), including Best Picture.One thing you will also find yourself liking is the choreography during the singing, it was warm and enjoyable. The movie script is also well written as it takes you through a Romeo and Juliet story with its own ideology and fun that you may actually forget that you are watching a Shakespeare adaptation.The director Robert Wise has won the Academy award for Best Director and Best Picture, for West Side Story (1961) and The Sound of Music (1965).

101,gsygsy,A very great movie,9,13 October 2006,"Stunning. Even forty-plus years after it was made, this movie will still leave you gasping at the dance numbers, the editing, the production and costume designs, the lighting, the colour - and that's even before you get to the music, lyrics, script and performances. Moreno, Chakiris and Tamblyn are dazzling. Beymer is fine in a role that is pretty dull until the last reel, at which point he acquits himself well. Wood is terrific, particularly in the final scene, where really, if she hadn't been the fine actress she was, the whole event would, in spite of everything, have seemed anti-climactic.There is such wealth of invention, imagination, and passion here, it's difficult to see how this isn't the greatest movie musical, an accolade usually handed to admittedly wonderful Singing In The Rain. I guess that the latter can justify its pre-eminence by being entirely a Hollwood product (albeit much of it the work of practised Broadway hands Comden and Green), whereas West Side, notwithstanding the dynamism of its photography, to an extent is a record of a pre-existing stage show. The fact is, however, that West Side is not really, at least in any ordinary sense, a musical. Although it owes a debt to works like Oklahoma!, and shares an enjoyment in theatrical energy with what is otherwise not even enjoyable rubbish like Hello Dolly, West Side belongs to a special group of American creations, of which Porgy and Bess is probably the best-known other example, which bring a number of different forms together at the highest possible level, and by doing so create something entirely new, not quite classifiable under any of the general headings. Although there are set-piece numbers that find links to other genres and styles - and indeed, a whole other play, since Romeo and Juliet is at the heart of this piece - there are other things that are uniquely West Side's, and the movie version's West Side in particular - such as the moment in the Dance at the Gym when Tony and Maria first see each other, or when the Jets sing, dance and act ""Cool"" in a garage with a low ceiling, in and out of headlamps.A very great movie.",West Side Story

Do we need a playground diagram where they'd all be on the same side of the chalk if they were honest with themselves? And Tonys' opening number can also be left on the cutting room floor. So let's begin.... A tale of the old immigrants taking offense to the new immigrants. This is the pulse of the story hampered by the Romeo and Juliet body and it's love sick symptoms. As iconic as it is, West Side Story has its shortcomings with 5 foot tall prancers trying to act tough with their ""war counsels"" and rumbles? Still can't get past The Broadway aspect of the storytelling through hammy performance is not my taste, but it has its entertaining moments, It's when the Puerto Ricans and Rita Moreno tell us their perspective that I feel connected to the experience. Misery loves company and so does a good sense of smart and sassy humor! The dance hall ""Mambo"" and roof top ""I Love To Live In America"" are some of the best movie dance scenes ever and the later's lyrics remain brilliant if not eternal!

It's loosely based on Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet.""The Jets are White Americans led by Riff (Russ Tamblyn) and in conflict with the Sharks, a Puerto Rican immigrant gang led by Bernardo (George Chakiris). The romantic couple includes Tony (Richard Beymer), once the founder of the Jets, but now ex-gang working in a drugstore. Maria (Natalie Wood) is a recent immigrant and the sister of Bernardo. Bernardo's girlfriend, Anita (Rita Moreno), and Maria work in a wedding dress shop.The two gangs are struggling to control the neighborhood and set up a ""rumble"" (a 1950s term) to settle dominance. Riff wants to set up the rumble with Bernardo on neutral territory at a local dance the first evening. There Tony and Maria see each other for the first time and are instantly smitten. While Riff and Bernardo set up the rumble, Maria and Tony meet and express their love. Tony later arrives at the planning meeting and gets the gangs to agree to a fistfight between one representative of each gang.The next day, Tony is pleased by this resolution, but Maria convinces him to stop the rumble entirely. However, it all goes wrong, and Bernardo kills Riff in a knife fight, and Tony kills Bernardo in a fit of rage with Riff's knife. Although Maria is horrified by her brother's death, her love for Tony finds them planning to flee. Even Anita finally tries to help Maria by taking a message to Tony. But the remaining Jets intercept Anita's approach and molest her. Responding in a rage, she tells the Jets to tell Tony that one of the Sharks, Chino (Jose De Vega), has killed Maria after learning of her relationship with Tony. Tony is devastated and runs through the streets calling for Chino to come and kill him too. Then he sees Maria, but when they run towards each other, Chino shoots and kills Tony.The magic of this film is the music, the choreography, and the cinematography, but not the script, which has some limp phrases. The metaphor of fences recurs constantly and effectively. But the costuming is oddly naive and bourgeois. The ""hoods"" I remember from high school when I was in middle school looked much more menacing these middle-class-looking kids. Where are the cigarettes behind the ears or the cigarette packs rolled up in the shirt sleeve? Where is Marlon Brando or James Dean when we need them? The policemen in the film seem inconsequential.

105,DavidYZ,Gang warfare interrupted by jolly song & dance routines!,2,8 May 2017,"This film is a bizarre mix of musical, crime, drama and romance. It's set in Manhattan and is like a 20th century, NYC, Romeo and Juliet - with added singing and dancing.Some of the song and dance numbers are lighthearted - and therefore totally out of place in a film that's meant to be both a serious romantic drama film and about gang violence. Seeing gangs about to fight - then suddenly break into a lively, fun song and dance routine - then continue with the fighting - is preposterous. This bizarre jolt back-and-forth between those two very different tones and styles takes away its credibility and the ability for the audience to take the film seriously.This film should either have been a serious crime drama romance without the singing and dancing - or lighthearted and fun throughout. This film is supposed to prominently feature an interracial romance. Why then, did they cast the clearly white, Russian-American Natalie Wood to play the Puerto Rican female lead? I know that Puerto Ricans vary a lot in skin tone, but when the filmmakers wanted to make the relationship interracial/intercultural, why not emphasise that by casting a mestiza or mulatta actress?",West Side Story

For me, the biggest problems the film has are its length and duration of the musical numbers. 2 and a half hours is a long time for a story you likely already know well, and many of the song and dance performances go on for too long, dazzling you with their spectacle but leaving you wondering when it will end and the story will continue.",West Side Story
107,nickmesafilms,West Side Story (1961) - Tonight! Somewhere! America! Maria!,10,2 August 2011,"Based on the popular Broadway hit, ""West Side Story"" is one of the most amazing musicals ever put to film. The retelling of the classic ""Romeo and Juliet"" story, is told into a story involving the duel of the Sharks and the Jets in the west side streets of New York, and how one small romance affects everything. First off, every single song in the movie is amazing, and they are always great songs to sing over and over again. The incredible direction of Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins helped make this musical into a beautiful portrait, and Robbin's choreography was super catchy, and it's really hard to dance to, and that's the fun about it. And the incredible cast including Natalie Wood, Richard Beymer, Russ Tamblyn, Rita Moreno, and George Chakiris was all super spectacular in every way, and this was a stellar cast, and their singing is so powerful. Also, the cinematography is fast-timing, the editing is fast paced, the art direction is super, the sound is remarkable, the music is powerful, and the finale brings enough suspense, drama, and romance as an end to this most powerful musical. With its catchy music, and incredible storyline, ""West Side Story"" is an amazing musical with amazing music, cast, and an epic power that brings everything together. ""West Side Story"", in my review, ""a frolicking and powerful musical, a perfect movie for everybody to enjoy"".",West Side Story
108,frankfob,"OK, let's get it out of the way",7,15 June 2008,"Natalie Wood is awful. Not just awful, but so relentlessly and completely awful she almost single-handedly ruins the picture. It had other problems, but her outrageous miscasting, her laughable attempts at a Puerto Rican ""accent"", her complete lack of chemistry with her supposed love interest, Richard Beymer, the fact that she was neither a singer nor a dancer but was given a part that required a lot of singing and dancing--neither of which she pulled off--were among the film's downsides. Richard Beymer's performance, however, is not nearly as bad as it's been made out to be. He plays Tony a bit more naive and somewhat goofier, maybe, than he should have, but compared to the acting jobs turned in by most of the other Jet ""gang members"", it wasn't bad at all. Much of the non-musical dialogue is insipid and painfully outdated even by 1961 standards, and other than Tony Mordente, the members of the Jets gang looked like exactly what they were--Broadway chorus boys. I realize this film isn't a documentary, and it was more important for the actors to be able to sing and dance than it was for them to actually *look* the parts they were playing--the Puerto Rican Sharks were a bit more authentic-looking, which was odd because the two main actors in that gang, George Chakiris (Bernardo) and Gus Trikonis (Indio), weren't Puerto Rican but Greek--but to tell the truth, the Jets were the sissiest looking and acting ""gangbangers"" I've ever seen. On the other hand, the supporting cast is actually pretty good--Simon Oakland as the gruff and racist Lt. Schrank, Ned Glass as Doc the candy store owner, John Astin as the doofus rec center director--but the ""gangsters"" themselves are just not very good actors. There are also several numbers where the songs aren't even remotely up to the level of the dancing that accompanies them (""Cool"" comes to mind).That being said, there are several upsides to the film. The dancing is spectacular--especially in the terrific ""America"" number, which just explodes off the screen at you--and the ""Dear Kindly Sergeant Krupke"" routine is still hilarious, even if a bit forced. The film's main advantage, however, is Rita Moreno. She is absolutely volcanic and blows everyone off the screen whenever she's on it, whether she's dancing, singing or acting (her scene in the candy store where the Jets rough her up is especially chilling, and it's all entirely due to her). I think Rita was the first real glimpse Middle America got of how smart, funny, sultry and sexy a Latina actress could be--up until then Latinas were mostly caricatures such as Lupe Velez and Carmen Miranda--and in the numbers she was in, especially the ""America"" routine, you just couldn't keep your eyes off her. You could really feel the pain and anger in her voice when she sang the ""Stick To Your Own Kind"" number. She won the Oscar for this role, and few actresses deserved it more.All things considered, it's still a pretty good movie, although frankly much of it is quite dated and doesn't hold up particularly well. But the spectacular dancing, the infectious and beautiful music (especially ""Maria"") and the Romeo-and-Juliet story still work. Natalie Wood, who didn't belong in this movie at all, doesn't quite manage to sink it entirely, even though she comes close on occasion (""There's a Place for Us"" comes across as a bad parody of the old Jeanette McDonald/Nelson Eddy movies where they sing into each other's faces and is hysterical in its awfulness). If you haven't seen it, it's definitely worth a look.",West Side Story
109,dr_clarke_2,One of the most unusual Hollywood musicals ever made,8,28 June 2020,"Robert Wise's multi-award winning 1961 film West Side Story must be one of the most unusual Hollywood musicals ever made. It is based on the musical written by Jerome Robbins, with music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, which in turn is based on Romeo and Juliet. And like Shakespeare's original play, but unlike many mainstream musical films, it's a tragedy.
West Side Story exchanges Romeo and Juliet's Montagues and Capulets for New York gangs the Jets and the Sharks, the former white Americans and the latter Puerto Ricans. Romeo is replaced by Tony, founder of the Jets but no longer a member, and Juliet by Maria, sister of Shark Bernardo. The story's trajectory is otherwise more or less the same, making this probably the only Hollywood musical in which people are knifed to death.
As noted, the music is by composer Leonard Bernstein, and it's dramatic, frequently unsettling and frankly astonishing. Although Wise (who would later direct the vapid, anodyne The Sound of Music) is credited as director, the musical numbers were directed by Jerome Roberts before he got fired for going over schedule and budget and he manages the rare feat of choreographing the dancing in such a way as to make groups of young men seem intimidating whilst they do it. The ""Cool"" sequence - musically complex and with an impressive dance sequence - is one of the film's song and dance highlights. Still, Wise's contribution shouldn't be overlooked: principally responsible for the mise en scéne, he combines location filming in the now vanished San Juan Hill area of New York City with stylised sets. The result is that the film looks theatrically unrealistic but never cartoonish and is visually striking. At certain points, the unreality of the film is deliberately heightened, for example during the first dance between Tony and Maria.
Daniel L. Fapp's cinematography is critical to the success of the film's visuals, since he essentially has to frame the complex dance sequences. Under Wise's direction, he provides various powerful flourishes: the opening tracking shot sets the scene as the camera pans across New York City from above, before closing in on the Jets and the Sharks as the tension between them rises. Later, the rumble scene features a highly choreographed fight on a studio set that is lit so as to cast ominous shadows; it culminates in the deaths of Riff and Bernado and actually shows blood.
The acting is perhaps less successful, with many of the Jets and Sharks obviously hired for their dancing skills, although George Chakiris impresses as Bernardo (for which he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor) and Natalie Wood gives a decent performance even if no amount of suspension of disbelief is likely to convince anyone that is Puerto Rican. Richard Beymer isn't bad as Tony either, although the best acting tends to come from the older actors in minor, non-singing roles, most notably Ned Glass as Doc and Simon Oakland as Schrank.
Whilst the acting could have been better, West Side Story nevertheless works well overall as a uniquely dark and stylish Hollywood musical that stands out amongst the more light-hearted examples of the genre. And whilst Shakespeare and Leonard Bernstein sounds like a winning combination, the film's overall success is a credit to everyone involved.",West Side Story

I felt a little embarrassed not having drawn the parallel with Romeo And Julliette until I read it here! West Side Story has always been for me the reminder of this great mystery of our wild humanity and it's often with sadness that I think of it. It seems as if we will never be able to get out of this rut of misery and violence . In similar work,I'm always divided between what I often see as the glorification of our weakness and an attempt to remedy to it. They, the artists, are they concerned with this side of things or simply about their art and their fame? The answer, I guess, is also a mystery and probably different to one and each. I often kept in mind WST when someone mentions how increasingly violent our society has become - and I wonder. I think any large city in the world had, and perhaps still have their own WST - and it started long before this production was thought of. Pehaps this is why I did not relate to Romeo and Juliette, I was too much taken by the dilemma people create when they try to merge various group with very contrasting background together. Yes to me, although entertaining, the love story was not the this work strong point. The portrayal of hatred through the amazing dance, songs choreography. Yes so much talent and energy. I also approved of the ending, it does not lies or butter up the story for a good feeling. It leaves you hopelessly in front of a too obvious reality. As it has often be commented on, and I'll put it in an other way, some aspects of it will alas be forever contemporary.",West Side Story
113,bwaynef,"Pretty good, maybe even great, but...",10,3 April 1999,"I first saw ""West Side Story"" in the winter of 1969 at the Lyceum theater on Fulton Avenue in Cleveland, Ohio.  It had been re-released several months earlier with ads that attempted to lure the audience that had been too young to see it when it first appeared in 1961.  ""Unlike other classics, 'West Side Story' grows younger,"" the poster claimed, while also boasting of its having won 10 Academy Awards, including the top prize for Best Picture. Although not fond of musicals, I was taken with this modern day retelling of Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet.""  Sure, Richard Beymer's Tony was a hopeless wimp, and Natalie Wood, like Beymer, merely lip-synched to the voices of genuine singers.  And sure, the street gangs appeared just a little silly and effeminate, rather than tough and menacing, while doing ballet leaps with switchblades in hand.  But the music of Leonard Bernstein was striking, and Stephen Sondheim's lyrics were witty and, at times, beautiful.  The song ""Maria"" is a gorgeous piece of work with some of the loveliest images ever conveyed in words, and a melody as haunting as a lost love.  And don't forget such often recorded ditties like ""Tonight,"" ""America,"" and, especially, ""Somewhere.""  There were also excellent performers, most notably Rita Moreno and Russ Tamblyn who not only contributed fine work as actors, but did their own singing as well.In 1969, ""West Side Story"" was a little more than seven years old and it was still playing in theaters, not on television.  The screen was wide, the lights were low, and it was easy to be swept away by the filmmaker's vision. Now, ""West Side Story"" is almost 40 years old.  The screen, and these days it's a TV screen, is small, the lights are bright, and ""West Side Story"" is a little harder to take. Richard Beymer's Tony remains a hopeless wimp, and the street gangs look like a gay version of the Bowery Boys.  It's not a bad film by any means, it may even be a great one, but it is a film that absolutely demands to be seen on the big screen.",West Side Story

There is no winking in the self-important posturing of ""West Side Story""'s Jets and the Sharks, or in its weepy, overwrought Romeo and Juliet plot. The drama seems to ask to be taken seriously, but it is hard to oblige when the street toughs click their heels, snap their fingers in unison, and spout forth bowdlerized epithets like ""Krup you!""

124,lyubitelfilmov,Forgive us Shakespeare! or The Bottom of Sixties Musicals!,3,23 April 2021,"Musical. A screen adaptation of the Broadway musical of the same name, based on the famous tragedy by William Shakespeare (Forgive us, William! We screwed everything up!) ""Romeo and Juliet"". I was open to the film, I did not feel any enmity towards it, ten Oscars bribed, but after watching I am ready to present my brief opinion - The bottom of the sixties musicals! Bottom, bottom and bottom again! Every time you think that it won't get any worse, and then they knock from the bottom again and again. But, despite my sincere hatred, I will note not only the minuses (of which there are plenty here), but also the pluses that were also found. This concludes with the introductory part and proceeds to the essence.So the pros:
1. Picture - I came across a version that looks great today, and does not cause any complaints. Most likely this is a restoration, since 2011 was the anniversary of this creation.2. New York - it is difficult to surprise with this now, because this city appears in so many art paintings that no one will have the patience to list them. Its slums, skyscrapers, the neighborhood of people from different cultures - all this is shown here as well. Moreover, the area where the picture was filmed was demolished immediately after filming ended, and now Lincoln Center is located in its place.So the cons:
1. The first six minutes - not only that nothing happens there, but also the music openly tunes the viewer to the fact that it is clearly not worth watching this picture. As I understand it, these six minutes were needed to stretch the timing (which takes two and a half hours).2. Songs - for this musical, the songs have become a gravestone, since not only are they INSANE BORING, and only two of them can be listened to (without the desire to make a gag reflex). I don't understand why everything is so bad? Where are the drop dead cool songs that make people dance, and in their souls words are born? Where in the songs is that ""fire"" that once lit up, will never go out? Only two normal songs, and then on a social theme. And for this boredom, the picture received one of the Oscar statuettes? I don't seem to understand people
3. Faded characters - there is nothing here but cardboard boxes trying to portray the emotions of living people. I had hope for Natalie Wood, but she did not cope, I am already silent about the main character. And I don't want to talk about the minor ones, because my table lamp is more charismatic than these so-called ""characters"".4. Where is the drama? - since we have a variation of Romeo and Juliet, then there must be a strong drama that should make the hearts of the audience squeeze at every such moment. But no! Figurines to you, with the top of your head! Why do you need this? You will do it! - said the producers and writers, without making any effort, so that the audience felt the drama. Tom and Jerry has more drama than it does here. Shame!5. Atmosphere - almost completely profukan. There is no feeling of immersion in the era, even despite the cars, costumes and general surroundings of New York. The fadedness of the characters doesn't add to the atmosphere either. It should be a shame!6. Boredom - you know, and looking at the ceiling was an exciting experience, not to mention the show from the window of the apartment (with the shouting of neighbors and the scream of children). Why did it happen? Consider: faded characters plus unbearable songs plus insanely drawn-out. What does it give in the end? That's right - boredom. I almost fell asleep probably thirty times before this deignedly ended. A shame!7. The finale - this finished me off completely, and unequivocally approved ""West Side Story"" to the first place in the list of ""Worst Musicals of All Time"". It will not be a secret that they took ""Romeo and Juliet"" as a basis? And everyone knows their tragic ending very well. All the directors who dared to film this story never dared to touch the ending - it's canon! Even if the scene was transferred to another country or era. The ending was always the same, but not here. What kind of hedgehog does Maria survive? The lovers must be dead in the ending. This is canon! For this insolence and such an outrage against the classics of the scriptwriters, they should be carved in the central square, and then they should be put tied up on a donkey and put on shameful caps on them! Bottom! Just the bottom!You know, I'm so disappointed that I won't single out the main characters today, because their acting is at the level of modern low-standard comedies, where there are no jokes. And this bottom won ten Oscars? And the true masterpiece ""My Fair Lady"" is only eight? And ""Lady"" can be watched and re-watched an infinite number of times, and again and again to have fun? I'd better go revisit the normal musicals (Phantom of the Opera, Moulin Rouge, and even My Fair Lady), until he finally became disillusioned with the genre. Moreover, is this lewdness ranked second on the list of ""Best American Musicals""?Well, let's see what happens to the first place. I really hope that Singing in the Rain will not disappoint me. Isn't it true ?!As a result, we have the worst musical of all time, with a disgusting script, bad music, boring songs, too long, and with lousy acting work. In short - full bottom!My rating is 3 out of 10 and I do not recommend this picture for viewing!",West Side Story

Certainly one of the best of '61 and incredible dancing move this at a great pace.  Natalie Wood is gorgeous, but doesn't make it as a Puerto Rican gal.  Richard Beymer looks right, but has no charisma.  George Chakiris and Rita Moreno are incredible and believable. A 7 out of 10.  Best performance = Rita Moreno.  I think it's almost impossible for a musical to score higher than a 7 (with the exception of CHICAGO and MOULIN ROUGE), but West Side Story has a great story, incredible score and excellent choreography.

It is a madhouse of pure emotions, dreams, love, intertwining with a background of stories that intertwine and unfasten continuously, things that in 1961, on the big screen, were not seen at all like today. With a strong message to send to the youth, it is a pure cult, a unique masterpiece of its kind: from Broadway to Hollywood with mastery.",West Side Story
130,jaddison383,It's the Supporting Details that are treasures...,7,4 September 2007,"West Side Story- so much history and prestige comes with that name. As someone who loves musicals of all kinds, but had never seen this one (born way after release), I had some nervousness watching it. Does it live up to it's praise? Mostly...Everyone knows the story: Two rival gangs the Jets (American) and the Sharks (Puerto Rican) battle it out over control of a small West Side of Manhattan. In the midst of this war, though, Tony(Richard Beymer) and Maria(Natalie Woods), two teens from opposite sides, fall in love. Can their love survive the war that is killing all else in it's path? I guess you'll just have to watch and find out.The music is wonderful and the choreography is gorgeous. The singing left some to be desired, particularly Richard Beymer's vocals. Natalie Woods had her vocals recorded over, and they are decent. The best vocals come from Rita Moreno. Most of what's best about this movie comes from her.Ms. Moreno won an Oscar for her performance as Anita, and it was well deserved. She completely steals the show and I only wish we could have seen more of her. Her performance is probably one of the most powerful I've seen. She has more than one scene that I will not soon forget. Her performance alone would make the show worth watching, but George Chikalis is equally strong as her brother, Bernardo. The two leads, Beymer and Woods, are fine, but nothing too special. Natalie Woods deserves some respect for her final scene. It is quite passionate.West Side Story is certainly not the best musical ever made- not even close, in my opinion. It is, however, a classic that will live on most likely forever for it's tragic story and wonderful music. Not to mention Rita Moreno- don't get me started again! 7/10 stars...Jay Addison",West Side Story
131,DanB-4,The Best Movie Musical Ever,10,25 August 1999,"I absolutely love this film. The dancing, the music, the over-the-top melodramatic acting, the language and the story. West Side Story is fourth on my all-time list and never fails to move me.The music is what makes it great. It was light-years ahead of its time. It's dischordant and edgy in a age when straight-ahead tap dance numbers where the musical norm. Leonard Bernstein did his best work here. The scene which (in the musical) is called Quintet is unparalleled genius. The scene jumps from the Jets to the Sharks to Tony to Maria to Anita and back again, all people singing of what they long for ""Tonight"". For the musicians out there, lengthy sections of this piece change time signature every bar. It both summarizes and advances the plot while at the same time, foreshadows disaster. There is no other scene like it in movie history.Its not a perfect film. Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer lack the chemistry that could have made this the greatest film of all time. But the gangs and the girlfriends more than compensate. They are what make this film so watchable.The choreography does not tire either. Nearly four decades later, West Side provides us with dance sequences that would still fit the bill today - most notably the prologue and the ""America"" scene.This is not only a film worth seeing and owning but a fabulous stage production that must be seen as well. **** out of ****.",West Side Story

134,marxsarx,"West Side Story creates its own wonderful realilty in a world of concrete, brick and wonderful music and dancing",9,15 March 2003,"********POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD***************************************** ""West Side Story"" is a tragic love story which is told with drama, singing and dancing.   The movie begins in an unusual way: with an overture and colorful but indistinguishable art work on the screen.  Nothing is wrong with your DVD player or VCR.  The scene will come into focus after several minutes of listening to the musical overture.  The movie opens with interesting panoramic views of New York from the perspective of looking down on the city.  One gets the impression immediately that this could be a 'pretentious' film. And someimtes it is.  Humans show up on the concrete landscape of New York.  They are young men, apparently from rival gangs. They dance, they sing, conveying their thoughts symbolically through dance and lyrically in song rather than through dialogue. Two policemen show up and there is some dialogue.  These are two rival gangs, one of white immigrants, and one of Puerto Rican immigrants.  Often, the two gangs seem more like rival dance troupes than genuine street gangs. The two gangs, the Jets and the Sharks want to rumble.  A rumble is set up for the next night, after a community dance.  The leader of one gang tries to get his friend, Tony, who was a former leader to come back to the gang and fight in the rumble but Tony who now has a job wants nothing to do with it.  Tony even encourages the gang to fight with 'skin' and not use knives, rocks or guns.  At the dance, Tony meets and falls head over heals for Maria, the sister of the leader of the Puerto Rican gang.  The dance is amazing with unbelievably great dancing on display by members of both gangs. The photography and special backgrounds are also terrific during the dance sequence.  Unfortunately, Maria's brother takes an immediate dislike to Tony who has dared to show an interst in his sister.  Maria naively talks Tony into going to the rumble to attempt to stop it, with disastrous results. The movie is full of amazing and delightful dance sequences and tremendous songs.  The dramatic impact of this movie kicks into high gear when Maria's brother is killed by Tony at the rumble after killing Tony's best friend. Both gangs are angry and are in a state of chaos as they scatter from the scene of the rumble.  Maria learns that Tony has killed her brother, yet in her sorrow and grief, still loves Tony. Maria plans to meet Tony and run away with him, but in a climactic scene, Tony is shot by the police and Maria embraces him while he dies.  It takes the death of Tony and the tears of Maria to bring the two rival gangs together and stop their hatred at least for the moment, and hopefully indefinitely.This is one of those movies that you must experience first hand to know what it is like.  It is definitely a musical, but it definitely not your average musical.  It may not be for all tastes, but to give it anything less than a 9 or 10 would be unfair because it is so unique and full of wonderful elements.  I thought that ""Moulin Rouge"" was a truly cutting edge and great musical, but I must admit that ""West Side Story"" was also innovative and daring, and made forty years before it.  You won't forget it after you've seen it, and songs and scenes will undoubtedly linger in your mind long after it ends.  Songs like ""America"", ""Maria"", ""Somewhere"" and ""Tonight"" are not easily forgotten.  The choreography is nothing short of spectacular! This movie puts ""Chicago"" with Renee Zelweiger, Catherine Zeta Jones, and ""Richard Gere"" to shame, especially the dancing.  One wonders what all the hullabaloo about ""Chicago"" (2002) is for after seeing ""West Side Story."" The story within ""West Side Story"" is much more compelling and touching. The songs are better.  Simply stated, ""West Side Story"" just works and gels together much better.  Watching West Side Story requires a commitment, though.  West Side Story is two and a half hours long.  The first half hour to hour of the movie may have you wondering if you like this movie or not the first time you see it.  But once this excellent film pulls you in to the world of the Jets, The Sharks, and their girls and once you buy into their reality, the intensity never lets up.  I give this amazing film 91/100 points.  Natalie Wood is beautiful.  Richrd Beymer is the boy next door with a big heart. Their love story will touch you.  Rita Moreno is a spitfire. Russ Tamblyn is a firecracker.  Simon Oakland and Ned Glass are terrific in supporting roles.  After you've seen ""West Side Story"" all the way through once,  you'll be able to go back and enjoy and savor the entire movie and the astounding one of a kind reality which it creates.",West Side Story
135,CihanVercan,"First time to watch? Get ready to have a feast for the eye, the ear, and ultimately the heart!",9,9 September 2008,"WestSide Story is an American icon, that reveals how today's world became global, that every modern democratic country of the Earth has every different culture mixed to live together in peace. So as you might guess WestSide Story is one socio-political movie that symbolizes post-modernism. This masterpiece also reveals the most frightening question that non-Americans -and undemocratic- keep in their mind, but afraid to ask: ""What if America has never been existed?"" Once you watched WestSide Story, you'll realize how post-modernism changed the world, that racism and vendetta are no longer conceptual.As a matter of art, WestSide Story combines a walloping score with exuberant choreography and spectacular screenplay to create a transcendent fusion of Realism and Fantasy, that will forever be a feast for the eye, the ear, and ultimately the heart. As a matter of movie concepts, the story line has the perfect progress beginning with the introduction of the two confrontational 1950s' New York city gangs, continuing with the love occurring between a girl from an immigrant group and a boy from a fanatical nationalist group, ending with the death of the gang leaders and the lover boy. When the story begins to progress, it becomes more and more fascinating through focusing of the lovers struggling to come together.

137,Tommy-92,"Electrifying, exciting, and in the end, stunning.",8,24 December 1999,"The electrifying part is the Jerome Robbins choreography, especially in the famous opening scene, the school dance, and the ""Play It Cool"" number. Always with a snap of the fingers, a whistle, and a strut.  The exciting part is the various rumbles and the action before and after.  The stunning part, of course, is the finale, which still has the power to rip the breath from your body, even if you know it's coming.  Oh, there are flaws, (Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer are beautiful but a trifle wooden and unconvincingly dubbed, and you wonder how so much can happen in a day), but they're pretty much made up for by the beautiful Bernstein/Sondheim melodies and the generally excellent screenplay, adapted from Artur Laurents' stage book.  My favorite songs: the aforementioned ""Play It Cool,"" ""Tonight,"" ""I Feel Pretty,"" in which Wood glows, and ""When You're a Jet, You're a Jet All the Way.""  My favorite scenes: Those containing these songs, and the scene in which Maria and Tony meet each other's ""dummy"" parents and pretend to get married.  In this scene, all is forgiven and you really feel for these people.  Then, there's the final scene.One last note: The songs ""America"" (which surprisingly lacked the energy I thought it would have), and ""Gee, Officer Krumpke"" make interesting commentary on the conditions the respective gangs live in.

A love story between two members of two enemy camps, among this is a criticism of the United States, street life, the situation of Latinos in American territory, among other things. It is directed by the duet made up of Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise, in the cast is Natalie Wood as the main, supported by Rita Moreno, Russ Tamblyn, Richard Beymer and George Chakiris.I really like musicals and this classic is no exception.The musical numbers cut through with tremendous choreographies used and songs with distinctive and humorous voices. The performances are a capable melodramatic touch especially Natalie Wood and the handsome Richard Beymer, where their love is passionate on an incoherent level. Rita Moreno and Russ Tamblyn steal the musical numbers with virtuosity and unique presences. George Chakiris looks great too at times.Contextualizing myself in the 60's this is groundbreaking and innovative. But watching it today is very theatrical, dense and slow so if the remake is well done it can introduce this pretentious work to new generations. This film swept taking 10 Oscars awards from 11 nominations, among them: ""Best Picture"", ""Best Director"" to the duo, ""Best Supporting Actress"" to Rita Moreno and ""Best Supporting Actor"" to George Chakiris which is not bad but for me this award should have been given to Russ Tamblyn who put the JETS musical numbers up there.",West Side Story

The movie is a musical adaptation of Shakespeare's classic tale of love and struggle, beautifully brought out with foot-tapping dance sequences. The wonderful lyrics and music also contribute to this most-vaunted film. The Sharks and Jets fight for place and hegemony over the other the gang and even fight scenes are wonderfully turned to dance sequences. Such is the effort taken by Choreographer and Co-Writer Jerome Robbins.When the two gangs meet in a dance club, a former founder-member of the Jets, Tony falls in love with Maria, sister of Sharks' leader Bernardo, at first sight. They are lost in oblivion when their eyes meet and are interrupted by their respective gangs. The gangs' rivalry gets fueled with Tony and Maria falling in love.They decide to battle it out with fists and be done with it once and for all. Both the gangs renege on not using weapons and come armed to fight. Tony is persuaded by Maria to bring peace between the gangs. When Riff, the head of the Jets, is stabbed by Bernardo, Tony enters the fight and kills Bernardo. They gangs are chased off the crime scene by cops. Maria doesn't lose her love for the man who murdered her brother despite her sister-in-law's advice to forget him. She even enters the Sharks' den to make truce but they ridicule and try to take advantage of her.

However, with ""West Side Story,"" I figure that having detested musicals for so long this one is worht commenting on- the same way ""Billy the Kid vs. Dracula"" would be, if I were lucky to see it. Robert Wise was, contrary to what film historian David Thomson said, a very apt director. ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" is one of the best sci-fi films ever made, and this is one of the best musicals. With ""West Side,"" he created a lively production with an interesting story line and none of the sappy ""My Fair"" saccrine which has made a lot of us refrain from sitting through many films of this genre.

142,irishm,The dancing is great,5,11 September 2015,"Unfortunately the rest of it just doesn't hold up all that well. This is one of those ""classics"" that I eventually got around to watching after many years of ignoring it, and since it finally came up free on streaming I decided to give it a shot. I can easily imagine how seeing this live on stage performed by a talented cast would be a pretty incredible experience, but from my point of view the dance-fighting (or fight-dancing) didn't make much of an impact on the story from a technical standpoint the moves were amazing, but it's hard to become emotionally invested in a brawl when the opponents are basically dancing with one another. I'm sure the audiences 50+ years ago saw it with completely different eyes, but today it just looks odd, not artistic.Aside from a couple of memorable numbers, the songs were average surprisingly few of them were particularly hummable or would stick with you for long after exiting the theater. It was disappointing to learn that the two lead performers were both dubbed for singing.I agree with previous reviewers who thought that Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood had very little on-screen chemistry. The fact that the two characters fell in love at first sight didn't bother me; I accept that kind of thing in films, but the actors have to sell it, and these two failed to. I also agree that the lack of exterior sequences (after the very beginning) was a problem; it made the production look a bit bargain-basement and constantly called attention to the fact that it was a filmed version of a play.It was nice to see good old John Astin turn up, albeit briefly I see that someone in the message boards has incorrectly identified him as Christopher Lloyd, and I can't quite see how one could confuse those two performers.Basically, anyone who likes musicals would do well to give this a try, with the understanding that it's showing its age.",West Side Story
143,Gambitt,Everything that was wrong and right with the 60s,6,3 March 2002,"This movie summarizes everything that was great and everything that was rotten with mainstream white society in the 50s and early 60s.Sure, the music is great in WSS.  There is dancing and singing.  Romance and action.  Drama and tragedy.  This is a movie about the American dream, about immigration, discrimination and the issues that foreigners faced.  There is a sort of unbridled and innocent passion with which this movie celebrates American culture.  West Side Story (1961): Classic, perhaps.  But timeless?Looking under the glitz and Hollywood glamour, behind the curtain, you start to notice how artificial and contrived this production was.  You notice that out of the dozen or so Puerto Ricans characters, perhaps 2 or 3 were actually played by Latinos.  The rest were just white actors with silly putty on their face using bad accents.  I noticed other peculiar flaws.  As talented as Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer may have been, why did they need voice doubles during the singing?  Of course, half of these high school students are played by mid to late 20-something actors, but oh well, that's to be expected even today.In the end, the film just comes off as plastic and white-washed to me.  This was a movie about white Americans and Latino Americans, but it was made by white Americans for white Americans.  This was a movie that sheltered, middle-class Americans could watch to make themselves feel 'multicultural' in the 60s.WSS is sweet, pure, innocent and enjoyable, but also synthetic and naive.",West Side Story

Also, there are some interesting comments about the demise of the filming locations (""The true West Side story"", joandambra from US; 15 November 2011).Some good points have been made about the two acting Oscar winners (Chakiris and Moreno) not singing (""Great Music and Choreography, But It's the Same Old Story"", edwagreen from United States; 27 March 2006). And, the authenticity of the natives vs. Puerto Rican conflict is questioned (""Problems with Authur"", harry-76 from Cleveland, Ohio; 4 September 2002)Frank Fob (""OK, let's get it out of the way"", frankfob from California; 15 June 2008) downgrades Natalie Wood and defends Richard Breymer, exactly the opposite of how I rate their performances. Finally, there are excellent points about the song ordering changes (""song order"", losmwl from United States; 1 April 2007) which change their contextual implications.""West Side Story"" doesn't top ""The Red Shoes"" as the greatest dancing movie ever, largely because of casting. The producers of ""Red Shoes"" needed Moira Shearer and waited a year for the reluctant ballerina to participate. Here the producers needed Elvis Presley as Tony. (Apparently Presley turned it down and regretted it afterwards.) Richard Beymer is as uncharismatic as he is inauthentic. (His one redeeming moment is when he apparently performs his own stunt climb over of a fence.)Natalie Wood is not authentic as the Puerto Rican Juliet, but she is superb overall, especially in the tear-jerking melodramatic closing scenes. Chakiris and Moreno are both very strong--Moreno's role has the most depth in the cast. However, the Academy Awards made a clear mistake in recognizing Chakiris before Russ Tamblyn's Riff. Tamblyn is the only member of the principal cast (i.e., Wood, Breymer, Chakiris, Moreno) who actually sings all of his character's material. Tamblyn sings, dances and performs flips superbly. He even seems fairly tough (as singer/dancers go) and is a focal point in almost every scene he's in. He should have won with Moreno.I saw this last evening (6/14/13) with the Baltimore Symphony performing. I have issues with the beginning. Leonard Bernstein's overture, with a single image of almost no visual interest, is a technique you'd expect with a live opera, but not a movie. (Still, Bernstein's music and Sondheim's lyrics are praise-worthy.) I also think the helicopter footage at the beginning is overly nauseating.Somehow viewers get drawn in by the Shakespearean finish despite having seen gang members constantly singing and dancing, belying their menace. That suggests the power of dance to inspire hope that it continues; when great dancing suddenly stops we feel sad. Imagine if Presley had appeared as Tony in 'West Side Story'. WSS was a single acting upgrade away from becoming the limit for dance cinema. It is still a real fun viewing experience.",West Side Story
145,jebyvyson,What a flashy film to look at,9,28 September 2020,"One thing I have to give props for is the art direction and production design. The colors of this film really shines here: red, orange, yellow, purple, really eye-opening. The way this movie is visually shot is outstanding and breathtaking to watch. I enjoy the score of this, especially the overture. As go as the music score is, the musical itself isn't all that memorable to me. One thing I can say about the musical is that it talks about themes of racism, love, how America is, and how the Jets became to be. The story is basically a Romeo and Juliet story except it takes place in the 50's up west of New York about 2 gangs taking the streets while two people from different sides fallen in love with each other. I find it fascinating how something that look or acts like a cartoon or comic comes to live on screen talks about real-world topics. I think these are the kind of movies you'll never seen made again today, although there is a remake happening so it has got alot of shoes to fill.",West Side Story
146,writerasfilmcritic,"In An Era of Great Musicals, ""West Side Story"" Was Among the Best",10,3 September 2005,"When they say they don't make movies like they used to, this is the sort of film they are talking about. Despite its flaws (and there are some), it is easily one of the best musicals ever made. Beginning with the overture and the opening scenes of New York City, circa 1960, it almost screams ""classic."" Some have criticized Natalie Wood's Maria (her dubious accent and the dubbed-in singing) or Richard Beymer's Tony (his slightly smarmy interpretation of the ex gang member gone straight), but the fact remains, their wholesome, fresh-faced characterizations defined the roles. And you simply can't top the film's instrumental score, its great songs (""Maria,"" ""Tonight,"" ""America,"" ""I Feel Pretty,"" ""A Place For Us,"" ""I Have a Love,"" and ""Officer Krupke""), its excellent choreography, or its very effective cinematography. Rita Moreno, as Anita, delivers what was probably her best performance in the movies, in particular her dancing and singing in ""America,"" while Russ Tamblyn, as Rif, the charismatic leader of the Jets, is seldom given the credit he deserved. Natalie Wood on the rooftop, anticipating another meeting with her newfound love, is a vision of grace and innocence, while George Chakiris as her brother Bernardo, the leader of the Sharks, is very convincing as the persecuted immigrant/mean-spirited hoodlum. And its not as if these are the only actors who did a great job. A number of the other supporting roles are delivered with memorable professionalism, too. In fact, the cast as a whole is superb. This movie poignantly (if simplistically) explores the purity of first love, while tackling intolerance and racism head-on, avoiding the tired, politically correct clichés that movies of today too often wallow in. Despite the simplicity of the story, it is always an emotional experience, no matter how many times you've seen it. While it is true that the Academy Awards have become very politicized, and no doubt always were to a degree, this movie snagged ten of them when great movies were being turned out almost as often as mindless pap is today. Not to be missed.",West Side Story
147,AlbertCinefilu,Good movie with some memorable scenes but it starts to grow white hair,8,3 January 2021,"Roger Ebert said that West Side Story was ranked #41 in a best movies article when it first appeared and by 2004 it was already out of top 250 IMDb. I wished so much this movie could remain somewhere near the bottom of the top 250 IMDb but I get why that's not going to happen again. It's not that people were so much different than us in the 60's but I feel people living today are less willing to forgive some plot-holes and gaps in logic just for the sake of the beautiful dancing, music, acting and some scenes with clever dialogue.This is just my opinion but I think the word for describing the audience of the 21st century is not ""romantic"" or ''mindless'' anymore. We are a bit more cynical and analytic and we still find pleasure in movies while temporarily turning our brain off but we don't do that as often as we used to in the past. That's not to say West Side Story is not a good story but perhaps a bit more ""poetry"" of the dialogue and filling some of the plot-holes could have made this movie extraordinary, a masterpiece. Otherwise, you keep asking yourself some questions that could partially ruin your experience like ''Wait, Tony killed Maria's brother and she is able to forgive him so easy? I get that he said it was an accident and she loves him very much but in order for Maria to feel really human and make us connect with her even more shouldn't she react like a real human would?''. There are several instances where questions like that pop out and my point is that someone watching in 2020 may pay more attention to those errors than someone watching in 1961. Also, I notice the manner in which the movie is very straightforward when it comes to calling a spade a spade and a shovel a shovel, something that I appreciate but many people rather subtlety nowadays. I understand both perspectives.I think this movie should have become a cult-classic like Singin' in the Rain and I am glad there's been a rising in popularity in the past few years.An 8,1 out of 10 for me.",West Side Story
148,charlessmith702210,Still pretty good as far as Broadway movie-musicals are concerned,9,15 February 2009,"Of course, the direct connotation between this Broadway movie-musical and the most-beloved Shakespearean tragedy, Romeo and Juliet, is very, very clear.Romeo and Juliet had the two rival families...the Montagues and the Capulets. In West Side Story, there are two feuding families but in the form of modern street gangs....the Jets and the Sharks.The Jets, of course, was made up of Caucasian people, and the Sharks were akin to today's Latin Kings street gang...made mainly of Puerto Ricans.Of course, the famous scuffles and skirmishes between the rival gangs cumulated in the famous ""Rumble"" scene. Especially when character Ice of the Sharks gang and character Riff of the Jets gang engaged each other in a knife fight; in Romeo and Juliet, the weapons used in the fight scenes were mainly rapiers.I especially liked the two leading ladies in the film...Rita Moreno (who played Anita) and Natalie Wood (who played Maria). But Rita probably takes the cake more than Natalie. Rita sounded stronger and confident even in the taunting scene where Anita was gang-raped by a number of Jets members at the bar.The musical numbers are definitely classic Broadway, and a pretty great smorgasbord of music by the great Leonard Bernstein. It is classic Broadway even when Berstein's music sounds nearly atonal and harsh, like in the opening number featuring the gangs dancing across the sidewalks and the playground. There is the jazzy, swing-packed energy of ""Cool"", and the gentle, prayerful waltz of ""One Hand, One Heart"". ""Something's Coming"" has a mix of rapid jazz waltz and the rapid two-four meter that can pay homage to almost any up-tempo song in the Broadway musical repertoire.The credit roll sequence is rather boring. But not completely. The use of the walls laden with graffiti along with the postlude music covering some of the famous numbers of the musical during the credits was helpful.The opening sequence was perhaps a very creative one. There is the famous silhouette of the Manhattan skyline, which changes colors during parts of the musical overture. After about 5 minutes, the silhouette changes to the real Manhattan skyline, and then through panning and panorama, the viewer is taken from Manhattan to the West Side of New York where the story begins. The opening feels a little too simple because on the focus of stillness at the beginning.",West Side Story
149,Colbridge,Style over substance,7,16 October 2021,"West Side Story is laced with cynicism, underlying racial tension and brooding violence often jarringly offset by vibrant choreography, over the top theatrical acting and catchy songs by Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim, which doesn't always sit comfortably during it's rather long running time.Garnished with 10 Oscars this film version of the successful Broadway play is highly regarded as one of the greatest musicals of all time and while there is much to enjoy with the singing and dancing and performances from Rita Morena, George Chakiris and Natalie Wood, this urban update of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is too lightweight to be convincing in satisfactorily addressing themes of juvenile delinquency, love across a racial divide, prejudice, social conflict and immigration. It is however true to say that these themes are still relevant today which is probably why Steven Spielberg saw fit to remake it in 2021.I do like the look of the film and it is undeniably a technically accomplished piece of work well directed by Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins with plenty of memorable and iconic songs, but ultimately it's camp, flamboyant treatment remains at odds with any sincerity it's tries to convey of it's core themes and it is more a case of style over substance.",West Side Story

The dancing is amazing, and it has unforgettable songs like Maria, America, Somewhere and Tonight. This is nothing short of a cinema masterpiece!It's an electrifying musical that sets the timeless story of Romeo and Juliet, expect in everyday gang warfare's in New York.Natalie Wood is impressive as her Role Of Maria, a young girl who has trouble finding love, until her eyes meet with Tony, played by Richard Beymer. His character is best friends with Riff, played by Russ Tamblyn, The leader of Tough gang called the Jets, who's enemy is Maria's older brother Bernardo, who is played by George Charkiris. He won a supporting role for this film, as well as his lover in this film, Rita Moreno. All together, this film won Ten Academy Awards including Best Picture.
The screenplay was written by Ernest Lehman. In my opinion, i love all performances by the Cast, and i love the way the movie was directed. Choreography was mind-blowing, and this is definitely a MUST see! Some might hate it, some might like it, But I LOVED it. It Was absolutely amazing! Greatest Movie of all-time.",West Side Story
152,gbrumburgh,"Dynamic and exhilarating landmark musical offering a still-topical spin on the age-old ""Romeo and Juliet"" story.",10,21 March 2001,"It is a testament to the musical and theatrical brilliance of ""West Side Story"" that this teenage urban love story, set to Shakespeare's classic ""Romeo and Juliet,"" has survived its outmoded 50s-style book (Arthur Laurents) replete with ""Dead End Kids"" posturings and corny, streetwise lingo (I still cringe when I hear the word ""daddio"").  For nowhere will you experience such electrifying, jaw-dropping choreography (Jerome Robbins). Nowhere will you thrill to a more exhilarating, passionate, full-throttled score (Leonard Bernstein, with Stephen Sondheim providing the libretto). And nowhere will you find a more dynamic, better-crafted musical that arguably surpasses its Broadway stage predecessor from overture to finale.Maria, a lovely, innocent Puerto-Rican girl (""Juliet"") and sister of a formidable gang leader, falls for an opposing though reluctant white-skinned gang member Tony (""Romeo"") with tragic results.  Set in a tough New York neighborhood where the two disparate groups, the Jets (""the Montagues"") and Sharks (""the Capulets""), battle for street territory armed with knives, zip guns and rocks, the determined love affair sets off a calamitous chain of events that, in the end, manage to instill hope in diversity.  Topical enough?The strength of ""West Side Story"" is that it does not try to hide its stage roots.  It still unfolds like a musical play.  The film is expanded but the talented cast is not dwarfed by on-location surroundings or panoramic camera work (""South Pacific"" fell victim to this).  On the contrary, the cast lights up every single playing space with sure-footed aliveness and plenty of 'tude.  Co-directors Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins stay true to the original, having the sense not to alter or butcher the score (""Man of La Mancha"") or haul in a slew of new, untried songs (""On the Town"", which actually worked for that musical).  In a particularly ""Wise"" move (sorry), two numbers were repositioned to enhance or intensify the narrative flow. In the film version, the ""Officer Krupke"" number sparked by a goofy Three Stooges-like levity, is moved earlier into the proceedings BEFORE the serious rumbles start, serving neatly as a light and humorous anti-establishment statement.  The tightly-coiled, finger-snapping ""Cool"" number is pushed way back, giving both song and situation a heightened impact as it goads and ignites the Jet's feelings of pent-up rage and retaliation AFTER their leader is murdered.  Smart move, daddio.The late Natalie Wood has been crucified by critics for her ethnic portrayal of Maria ever since day one.  It was not because of any political incorrectness at the time (reigning Hollywood white glamour queen goes Latino) for that hot issue didn't erupt until decades later.  It was her limited range as an actress.  But over the years, I have grown accustomed to Wood.  Yes, despite the melodramatic leanings, the necessity of vocal dubbing (by the incomparable Marni Nixon), the flawed Puerto-Rican accent and the general overuse of Coppertone, I still feel for this Maria.  What Wood does offer is utmost sincerity and heartfelt poignancy.  So I'm one person who has gotten off the Natalie Wood-bashing wagon.  Richard Beymer is another matter.  An extremely weak, uncool choice for Tony, his toothy, freshly-scrubbed, chipmunk-like mug and awkward gait reads more like library assistant than gang member.  Who would have thought Beymer would be the one to dazzle us much later in the totally cool and offbeat ""Twin Peaks""? Still, Wood and Beymer commit themselves 100% and manage to create a credible, if not charismatic, love duet that doesn't get in harm's way.Since the film's emphasis is really on dance, it's the flashy second leads who provide the real firepower.  Rita Moreno's smouldering Anita (""The Nurse"") is a spitfire of anger and attitude, while George Chakiris as her Shark leader boyfriend Bernardo (""Tybalt"") demonstrates slick, controlled menace.  Both Oscar-awarded here, Chakiris, in his debut, proved a lightweight acting talent himself, never finding a role like this again. Russ Tamblyn as Riff (""Mercutio""), the recently inaugurated leader of the Jets, is a hotbed of jaunty, scrappy impatience.  Both he and Chakiris are riveting as they demonstrate poetry in motion, leading a pack of Edward Villela-like tough guys into athletic, gravity-defying dance moves.""Romeo and Juliet vs. the 'Hood"" should be required viewing for all grade-school children solely on the basis of art and education.  The adults already know the value of this treasure.",West Side Story
153,gerry-russell-139,Without serious rivals as the greatest musical film ever!,10,7 February 2002,"The incredible choreography and the soaring melodies are the centerpiece of this dynamic, standard-setting epic musical. In my opinion the choreography is at its greatest during the Dance at the Gym sequence partly because the background music is so contagiously brilliant and the best song (not the most POPULAR, mind you) is the TONIGHT QUARTET that last note is so incredible you just can't but wish you were up there with the cast singing right from your soul. Natalie Wood has been crucified by the press since day one for her lack of emotion in the part but it works just fine in reality. These days she's gotten more criticism over the fact that she's as Puerto Rican as Doris Day and maybe she is but I still prefer her in the part rather than Audrey Hepburn (whom I had read was offered the part as well as CLEOPATRA and THE SOUND OF MUSIC). They should have aimed all the backlashing reviews exclusively on Richard Beymer. The part calls for a love-struck, can't-see-any-other-perspective-than-my-girl's type of boy but Beymer's Tony is a bloodless whimp. The great performance in the film is Rita Moreno as Anita. She has even more nerve and determination than George Chakiris' Bernardo. Her final scene at the end of the film is summed up as raw, resonant and outstanding. Chakiris is more calm, cool and only so amped up in the Rumble scene. He plays the perfect Latino teen of the 50s, nothing ever really bothered him until his territory was invaded (i.e. his sister). The other standouts in the cast are Susan Oakes as the lovable, determined tomboy Anybodys and Russ Tamblyn as the fun-loving, acrobatic Riff. They both give underrated performances, maybe because they looked and played like two typical kids for their day.As a film, WEST SIDE STORY is better than the original play. Carol Lawrence who played Maria on Broadway looked more Italian than Puerto Rican, Larry Kert was too old to play Tony and Chita Rivera as Anita didn't have enough vocal power to sing. It came to the stage the same year as THE MUSIC MAN (the corniest, most sickeningly-sweet film I've ever seen) and WEST SIDE the play only won two Tonys (no surprise, the film version is better) and MUSIC MAN took home the Lion's share of awards. When WEST SIDE came to the screen it took home ten Oscars (more than any other musical film has before or since) and MUSIC MAN came out a year later and only got two Oscars (ha! ha!). Just goes to show how wrong the theater critics can be about a bad play saying it can't be made into a great film.",West Side Story
154,byrann_gowan,"Tony, Tony, wherefore art thou, Tony?",8,27 January 2012,"""West Side Story"" is the tale of two lovers who fall in love. I won't say anymore than that about the story, because if you know Romeo and Juliet, then you already know the story of ""West Side Story."" That being said, this is an amazing film that deserved every Academy Award that it had gotten: Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Art Decoration (Set Decoration, Colour), Best Cinematography (Colour), Best Costume Design (Colour), Best Director, Best Film Editing, Best Original Score, and Best Sound. It also won a special award for Brilliant Achievements in the Art of Choreography in Film. It was only beat out in one category: Best Writing (Adapted Screenplay), which went to ""Judgement at Nuremberg."" As normal, I'm not big on talking about the Cinematography, or the Sound, or the Costumes, because, as it always show, they are completely over-shadowed by the acting talents. Simon Oakland was great as Lt. Schrank, who is basically Prince Escalus in Romeo and Juliet. George Chakris deserved his Supporting Actor award for his portrayal of Bernardo, the Tybalt of the story, as did Rita Moreno with her Supporting Actress in the role of Anita, the Lady Capulet/Nurse from Romeo and Juliet. Russ Tamblyn was great as Riff, the Mercutio of the story.But, no one, in my opinion, can come even close to the stardom of Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood as the two ""Star-crossed lovers,"" Maria and Tony. Both of them were robbed of the Best Actors/Best Actress awards, if you ask me. I completely believed them, and in a film, that's saying something. A high thumbs up for them.Now, I can't review a musical without talking about the music and the choreography. Come on; you knew it was coming sooner or later. The music is very catchy, from the widely fun ""America,"" to the love song ""Tonight,"" to the very cool song ""Cool."" I know; I'm full of cheesy puns. But, honestly, the music and the choreography was very well-done here, and the singing was great as well! Kudos to everyone on that! Overall, it's a great film/musical. If you're not big on ""Romeo and Juliet"" then you might want to skip this, but otherwise, I'd say go and see it. I loved it. I usually love musicals; in fact, the only one that I plan on not seeing anytime soon is ""Mamma Mia!"" Don't ask me why; I've just never been interested.

What makes this one so special is that it improves the stage work by freeing the camera to follow its dancers and singers across large areas of what look like actual NYC locations. And it takes a key number,America, sung on the stage by the Purto Rican young women, and, by simply adding their boyfriends, create a whole new dynamic. This scene becomes a truly memorable, colorful and exciting cinematic showcase.

The Jets and the Sharks are two rival gangs that are struggling amongst themselves and the police. Tony (Richard Beymer) is a former member of the Jets who has left the gang lifestyle, but he is forced back into it when his old friend Riff (Russ Tamblyn) requests his presence at a meeting between the gang leaders to discuss the terms of war. At a dance, Tony meets the Sharks leader, Bernardo (George Chakiris), and his younger sister, Maria (Natalie Wood). As Tony and Maria fall in love, tension grows between the two gangs and boils over into an all out war.The great thing about this film adaptation is the dance choreography and the cinematography. The story moves at a brisk pace, and the music and dancing are mesmerizing. The transition from stage to screen is excellent, and I think that this is one of the finest film adaptations of a play that's ever been created.What holds it back a little bit to me is that it never breaks out of the confines of the work it is based off of. We all know how the story is going to end. The change of setting and the fact that it's a musical do a little bit to shake things up, but in the end ""West Side Story"" is not a movie that you really *need* to see. It deserves a considerable amount of praise for its production, and the talent of the cast in their performances as actors, singers, and dancers. I would even say that it deserves its Best Picture Academy Award win (1961 wasn't that strong of a year for movies). It deserves to be marveled and respected as a piece of history and pop culture. I just personally don't get a whole lot out of enjoyment out of this one outside of a handful of catchy tunes. I think ""Singin' in the Rain"" and ""The Sound of Music"" do a much better job of telling stories that are both original and engaging, and they also have better music.",West Side Story

Of course it is the music and dancing that we mostly remember and Jerome Robbins richly deserved his part of the directorial Oscar. But the rest of the movie, with the story and acting, were equally captivating. I enjoyed Wood and Beymer as the leads, though sometimes I wonder if Beymer's Tony really was the type to lead the Jets.I enjoyed John Astin's small role as the dorky dance arranger.

162,Darth_Stat,A milestone achievement in entertainment.,9,22 May 2001,"It's still one of the most watchable flicks nowdays, and easily transcends generations and really is a vibrant experience but in the tradition of Romeo And Juliet it is in one respect a let down.In R&J the gangs were not the central piece of the story, it was the relationship, and it brought resentment about the rivalry. In this the hirachys and whole ego complex around the gangs is so fun that it is more a glorification of it than an instrument to demote it. Riff and his lieutenant, his best friend who brought victory for them against past gangs, this is a fable surrounding Tony, the Romeo of the situation, he is a god in the gang and they talk about the emeralds and the Jets' history in the town and traditions around organised warfare, none of that was in R&J it was just two families but it serves two purposes for this movie. One, it shows how far Maria brings Tony from the way he used to be, and it humanises the jets as a whole.If it did not have those fun elements it would not be half the movie it is however, that be, an entertainment fest. The dance choreography is superb and the music unforgetable, the acrobatic fight scenes are also a pleasure to watch, and the finger clickin walk is recognised by many a person.
Few would have thought it possible to create a base formula for remakes from a remake but there has been many a movie since using the R&J formula with the West Side Story variations.This is a milestone achievement, be sure to see it in the best form possible.9/10",West Side Story
163,caseyt-48511,A Great Film With Some Downsides,8,21 June 2020,"West Side Story has aged strangely. The choreography is still absolutely incredible and it blows my mind every time I see those numbers. The songs are also quite memorable and get stuck in your head. And of course the story, even with its weak points, is timeless. However, the acting from anyone not named Rita Moreno or George Chakiris is mediocre to just bad. Poor Natalie Wood. This could be her most iconic role but I've never thought she did a great job. Same for Richard Beymer. Despite that, their chemistry somehow works. Maybe it's their blandness, but I can't help but root for these two to get together.Two street gangs of different ethnicities (Hispanic and white) can't stand each other for various reasons. But the ex leader of one gang and the sister of the other gang leader fall in love. Let the Romeo and Juliet story begin! The film tackles some pretty heavy themes for a musical. Both sides are prejudice toward each other, mostly because of their race sadly. Charge up the irony meter since many of the Hispanic actors are played by white actors, go figure... Another unfortunate practice that we thankfully don't see much at all anymore and I hope we never do. The film is surprisingly smart with its themes. Never beating you over the head with them but letting you know explicitly what it's wanting you to know.The film won 10 (10!!!) Oscars. Which seems insane today since your rarely see films win more then 5 these days. I'd say it deserved most of them. Especially for its music, cinematography, editing and for the great Rita Moreno. West Side Story is a very entertaining, if a little too long. It's story is timeless and the musical aspects are breathtaking. But the acting leaves much to be desired.Later this year(2020) Steven Spielberg's version will be released. I have no doubt that Spielberg will do an excellent directing job, and casting actual Hispanic actors is a great step, but I'm not sure it will hold a candle to this one. Despite its flaws, this is a special film for me. Next year it turns 60, and I would love to see a new 4K restoration. That opening number in 4K, I can only imagine how beautiful that will look.",West Side Story
164,joseph952001,Like A Bottle of Wine: West Side Story Ages With Time,10,9 January 2007,"I have to admit that when I first saw West Side Story, I didn't like it, but there are other movies that I didn't like when they first came out such as Gigi, but as the years roll by, these movies now are very entertaining. I believe that movies like West Side Story and Gigi were not really good for the time that they appeared. They are more for today than yesterday and will be much more appreciated for what there are in the future years to come. As far as casting goes, they could not have done a better job. The original cast on Broadway just could not have done it. There has been a lot of criticism about not casting Broadway Stars in the movie versions, but the Broadway Stars could not bring the American movie going public into the theaters to make the movie pay for itself. At first, Jack Warner was criticized for not casting Julie Andrews in the movie version of My Fairf Lady, but as Warner stated in his autobiography, nobody in Des Moines knew who Julie Andrews was, but they certainly knew who Audrey Hepburn was because the financial boom that was made off of her portrayal in The Nun Story proved that, and he was right in his casting her as Eliza even though most of her singing was dubbed by Marni Nixon. We will never know what My Fair Lady would have been like with the original soundtrack with Audrey Hepburn doing her own singing, but some of the songs were partially sung by Hepburn, but we do know that Marni Nixons voice was not suited for Audrey, but it was suited for Deborah Kerr in The King and I and definitely suited for Natalie Wood in West Side Story. Most of the singing for Anita was done by Rita Moreno for West Side Story, but only one song was dubbed and that was her duet with Maria for A Boy Like That. But as we know, dubbing is not a new thing in Hollywood. Rosalind Russell who can sing said in her autobiography that no matter what anyone says, that's Roz singing up there, but that's not entirely true. All of the songs were sung by Russell except for one. She just could not get Everythings Comin' Up Roses off the ground, so Warner hired Lisa Kirk to do the honors and for a hefty sum of moolah! But, back to West Side Story. First time around I hated this movie. Just couldn't stand it, but as the years roll by, now I see it as a great movie and a true work of art. The only flaw that I see is at the beginning of the movie when the boys start dancing while bouncing the basket ball. Still does't set well with me. Being an ex-dancer myself, it could have been done with less of a ballet-ish beginning. The guys look too much like sissy's that rough tough gang guys! But, thank God I can remember when it first came out and I saw it on the great big wide screen with stereophonic sound. This is the way movies like this should be seen. If you haven't seen it that way, you have never seen the glory of West Side Story. When I was in the Army, I went to Paris, France, and the Parisians wouldn't let it go. It was still playing at one of their theaters for three years running. Now, that proves that that West Side Story is one of the greatest movie musicals ever made!",West Side Story

The close ups of the faces was the prime plus! This movie made great use of the close-ups.Everyone knows that this is a retelling of William Shakespeare's Play Romeo and Juliet.  Natalie Wood as the lovely Maria from Puerto Rico represents the Capulet Family.  Richard Beymer as Tony represents the Montagues.  It is a pleasure to see Ms. Wood's pretty face although her practiced Spanish accent was a little too forced.  And, credit must be given to Marni Nixon who provided the singing voice for Maria's songs.  Still, we would all like to have a girl friend like Natalie Wood. Richard Beymer played a tragic Tony and member of the Jets street gang well. Jimmy Bryant must be given credit for Tony's singing voice.  Russ Tamblyn stole many of the scenes with his dancing prowess and as Tony's friend Biff. Just when Tony tries to get out of the gang, Biff pulls him back in!  {Just the same line Michael Corleone said in the Godfather III! There must be some secret command in movie writing that you can never leave a gang and if your try your character always ends up dead!}  Rita Moreno and George Chakiris play Anita and Bernardo much better than Maria and Tony as far as the actual acting goes.  Real passion and screen presence.  No wonder Ms. Moreno is a hit in the HBO Series, ""Oz."" Betty Wand must receive credit for Ms. Moreno's singing voice.Character actors Simon Oakland as the police lieutenant and Ned Glass as the candy store owner, Doc, showed why they are always favorites in the movies that they were cast to play.  Solid professional performances here.The entire Jet's gang membership is well blended.  These ""teens"" are funny, musical, and dance well.  The funniest music of the whole movie is the ""Dear Officer Krupke"" number making fun of William Bramley as the local cop on the beat.  Listen to the lyrics and you will know why we still have teenage delinquency, because one agency passes the buck to another agency.Serious credit must be afforded the late great Leonard Bernstein for his musical score.  After all, this is a musical play on film!Yes, there is nothing like seeing a movie the ""old-fashioned"" way on a large Cinemascope theater screen!...As Siskel and Ebert would say, ""Two Thumbs Up!""",West Side Story
166,ctrout,One of a Kind,10,27 July 2004,"The story is well-known but if you haven't seen it, you might not know that it is. This is really just an updated musical version of Shakespeare's classic Romeo & Juliet. And it's the best version there is.The Jets and the Sharks are rival street gangs in New York City. They battle for territory and respect. But one day the former Jets leader, Tony, falls in love with the sister of the Sharks' leader, Maria.What will happen when these two gangs find out about this little romance? You'll have to see the move to find out. And you should see the movie. It's one of the greatest musicals ever made. And one of the greatest movies ever made.You've all seen or heard about Romeo & Juliet, but you haven't seen it like this. And once you see it, you'll wonder why they don't make movies like this anymore. Musicals are a great genre, and this film proves how great it is.It won ten Academy Awards, including Picture, Director, Supporting Actor (George Chakiris), Supporting Actress (Rita Moreno), Art-Direction, Cinematography, Costume Design, Editing, Score, and Sound. It only lost the award for Best Adapted Screenplay.",West Side Story

""Moulin Rouge!"" is but a cheap and gaudy shadow.""West Side Story"" is truly the most amazing movie ever made. Plot, characters, cinematography...perfect. Critiquing these would be like critiquing the chord structure of a Beethoven symphony.Speaking of symphonies, have you heard the music to this picture? It's gorgeous! I am a fan of John Williams, but he is no Leonard Bernstein.I just saw this movie on the big screen in 35mm for the very first time (I was not born yet when it was originally released). I have seen a lot of films on the big screen, but no modern film compares.For one thing, all the actors had *talent* back then. It's really them singing, dancing, acting, and even climbing over walls and making it look like ballet. Such facility...they must have rehearsed forever!In a modern film, they wouldn't bother...they'd have dancing doubles do the feet, singing doubles (and electronics) do the voices, and have cheap cuts and angle shots so you wouldn't notice as much. Here they focus on the actors and their abilities; cuts are sparing, and everything is genuine and rings true.Such amazing choreography can't be seen on the stage. The film media is used to the utmost to create a spectacular effect.If you ever have the opportunity to see this movie on film, in a theater, jump! You will be reminded that movie masterpieces can and have been made.",West Side Story
168,akoaytao1234,Not my cup of tea,6,8 August 2021,"Its difficult to judge this film. It has this weird dichotomy. It is modern in the sense that it tackles important issue in a way that feels truthful to this day. It is wonderfully photographed and has sensible acting. BUT here's the deal, i do not care for it as an musical. I do not really care about its music. It is a bit too much AND lacking the pizzazz I loved with other musicals. In fact, I think the musical elements makes certain portion of the film weirdly laughable and glaringly distracting, like the pirouettes during the fight scenes.Regardless, the issues it tackles is very well informed and its nuance portrayal of race, policism, colorism, and interracial relationship is impressive given its age. Clearly, criticism in brown face is valid but we do need to consider true limitations of the time. Sadly, not my cup of tea but did not hate it at all. Might even rewatch later.

I'm a big fan of him and i'm ''driving'' into my future to begin like him, an man who create a new sound of music, who unite classical, jazz and pop, if you listen others of his works and pieces and musicals, one for all his great MASS of the 1971  or also his Candide.The second think about it is the libretto, written by the unforgettable Stephen Sondheim and Arthur Laurents. A really great libretto, insipred by Shakespeare, and who is unforgettable, like the movie.The other things, the songs, the direction (by the unique Jerome Robbins, who also coreographed the irrestitible ballets of the movie and who also was a great friend of Bernstein since their first work togheter, the ballet Fancy Free) and the casting, with the best MGM actors of the 50' and the 60', are also unforgettable, like this movie, who introduce us to one of the most ''beautiful sound in the world''...

173,highkite,Adaptation at its best!,9,24 June 2006,"Everyone knows the story of Romeo and Juliet. Everyone has also seen at least one play or movie of the most popular Shakespearean story. However, what happens when you modernize a Shakespeare play and make it into a musical? You get ""West Side Story"".The story follows two gangs in New York City: the Jets and the Sharks. One Puerto Rican, and one American. Bernardo (George Chakiris, Oscar-winner for Best Supporting Actor), the leader of the Puerto Rican group, Sharks, hates life in America and can't stand their racist image upon the foreigners. Riff (Russ Tamblyn) leads the Jets, New York-born gangsters who want nothing but to clean the Puerto Ricans out of their city. Bernardo's younger sister, Maria (Natalie Wood) falls for a young American (Richard Beymer) who's friends with the Jets. Soon, the two sides find themselves in a struggle while Maria and Tony (Beymer) create confusion with their love for each other.""West Side Story"" broke many records. Becoming the most successful adaptation of Romeo and Juliet, being the only movie ever to have two directors who both won an Oscar, and influencing a generation of filmmakers, the movie stands as one of the greatest musicals ever created. Directors Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise create a film completely visually stunning and unique. From the excellent choreography to the flawless editing and directing of each musical segment, ""West Side Story"" remains as one of Hollywood's main entrepreneurs in film-making.The unforgettable beginning sequence, in which the camera overlooks Manhattan and then zooms into a playground where a bunch of hoodlums stand and start snapping their fingers remains one of the best and most memorable scenes in cinema history. Utterly entertaining, and beautifully filmed, ""West Side Story"" is a remarkable and entertaining movie for everybody. Robbins and Wise construct an inspiring musical that touched the hearts of people all over the world. Staying away from typical feel-good dramas, the movie is a bright and colorful plethora of society in the 1950s. Almost all the actors enjoyed excessive physical training to endure all the intricate dance sequences as well as keeping a figure that resembled a ""cool"" personality.Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer have enormous chemistry as the modern Romeo and Juliet stuck between two wars. The over-the-top sympathy we feel for the two characters is so abundantly emphasized through their musical sequences: Beymer's ""Maria"" and Wood's ""I feel pretty"" numbers really convey their love, avoiding any cliché with superior directing.""West Side Story"" is a movie that one can watch over and over again. From the superb directing to the flawless choreography, it grabs hold of the audience and reaches deep. A movie experience for everyone and anyone.

Based on the hit Broadway musical, which is a modern update on the tragedy of Romeo and Juliet, it still is a hit, even after its premiere 46 years ago. Natalie Wood (singing by Marni Nixon) and Richard Beymer are the two star-crossed lovers, and they are great (even though they didn't get along off-screen). Rita Moreno is AMAZING as Anita, Maria(Wood)'s friend, as are Russ Tamblyn as Tony(Beymer)'s friend Riff, and George Chakiris as Anita's boyfriend Bernardo (both Moreno and Chakiris won Oscars for their performances). Jerome Robbins' choreography is a highlight of the film, as are those wonderful songs (AMERICA, TONIGHT, COOL, and GEE, OFFICER KRUPKE). The direction is by Robert Wise (who won the Best Director Oscar for THE SOUND OF MUSIC) and Robbins (who shared the award for this film with Wise).This Best Picture winner is one of the greatest films ever!

177,Dr.Mike,A (slightly) dissenting opinion,7,11 January 2000,"I just finished watching West Side Story for the first time and was left with mixed feelings.  The dancing is excellent, some of the best ever filmed.  The music is very good, although not the best ever.  Since I am young and not familiar with the songs, I approached them fresh and found many of them flat.  Certainly, Tonight and America are great songs, but many of the other ones, especially the love songs, grew tiresome.  The acting by everyone but the leads was good;  however, Natalie Wood is TERRIBLE.  Rule #1:  When casting a Puerta Rican, find a Puerta Rican.  Tony is also a weak lead who, despite his physical presence, never is convincing as a former gang leader.That covers the good and some of the minor bad.  After all, great films can overcome bad performances.  However, this one does not.  The love story couldn't possibly be any flatter.  Since the leads are so wooden, the audience is left wondering why anyone would fall in love with them. Their dialogue is straight from a high school love letter, which one may argue is fine except we all wrote better letters than that, didn't we?  Even worse is the film's overwrought violence.  The ever-lingering threat of deadly violence mixed with the dream-like reality of the dance numbers creates a disturbing atmosphere.  All of he whimsy and fantasy are wonderful.  A whole new world is created and nurtured by the dancing.  However, the violence is real, and the film never even tries to balance the blood with the light-as-air feel of the rest of the piece.  I find it to be a distinctly American film, one that even in its creation of an alternate world must include hideous violence because a world without it is too foreign to be imagined.  I also found many of the images to be dull. Yes, we know they are caught in cages, and no, I don't need to see another chain link fence.  Yes, we know their Catholicism binds them, and no, we don't need to see another cross.  The heavy-handed message that the older, prejudiced generation has wrought the violence falls flat too.  Let's face it:  the Jets are a bunch of cretins. Nothing is stopping them from doing what Tony does:  fall in love and listen to his heart (I understand why they don't want the job). The Sharks strike me as quite a conservative bunch.  In the end they just want to fit in, especially the women.  One can see them sacrificing their culture in order to fit in.  By trying to elicit sympathy for both, West Side Story leaves you feeling nothing for either.  I believe it has much to do with Robert Wise's direction.  He always was a sloppy director, and this film reeks of his touch at its worst moments.  At least Robbins provides some wonderful dancing that ranks with the Red Shoes and Singin' In The Rain as some of the best ever put on film.  In the end, West Side Story falls short of classic status by any criteria other than that of the fond memory.",West Side Story
178,amanbirsingh,West Side Interesting Story!,7,27 October 2020,"Opening with a tough disclaimer given the meager backgrounds it comes from, West Side Story is provocative for what it wants to achieve, or throw off.Most receptions of this film are disparaging and the film team makes no qualms about them being a kind of suffering critique. An obvious tribute to the brotherhood and camaraderie that was responsible for the early successes of the American economic story, especially the Western frontier, it does not even spare fellow citizens at times, looking quite busy working the easier slopes in the more northern Dakotas and speaking a different method. America lives here. Furthering the cause, the characters also target enemy nations like Germany and its Patrons who determine freedom for their people but expose their lack of organization.Sticking with the main issues of youth rebellion, alienation and unemployment in the poorer west side, it tries to fill existence offered by the ordinary human ritual of song and dance. Various scenes try and bring out the qualities and values of social intelligence that exist or that are being lost but are attached to a National identity. Also, women speak openly and boldly, they mingle with men and demand power, and they determine course.Choreography and Sets are a major plus for the film. The dance sequences are ordinarily fantastic. Real sets transform into stages easily and lighting shifts from bright to dark quickly with the mood.It is a shade away from becoming apologetic but for the love stories that are subtly flowing toward their tragic ends. There is a sense of sophistication and maturity about the story that claims to lend a helping hand to everyone else fighting for more insight and inspiration.The film director duo have clearly tried to make a very entertaining film inside the social cause of integration.",West Side Story

I'm not crazy about the whole ""Romeo and Juliette"" story. But it is very well written and very well performed. One of my favorite actresses, and the most beautiful actress ever in my opinion, is Natalie Wood, and she is great in this movie. Whenever I hear the song, ""Maria"" I think of her. There are some funny parts, and some of the music is memorable, such as ""There's a time for us"", but I don't think I could watch it all the way through without fast forwarding. But there are a couple parts I would rewind and watch over as well. I suggest you rent the DVD and watch it with remote in hand.",West Side Story

It may be because I don't have much experience with musicals (though I recently seen and loved Fiddler on the Roof). Partly, for me, the actors were not particularly memorable. The focus likely was on dancing and singing skills separate from acting ability and the quality of dialogue. This is in contrast to Fiddler on the Roof, where the actors and dialogue were so real and impactful from beginning to end. Just my opinion.",West Side Story

Ultimately, aside from the singing and dancing, the film really drags with far too many characters and caricatures crowding the screen making the star crossed lovers Tony and Maria peripheral characters which may be a blessing because Wood and Beymer are a dull pair and Beymer is not persuasive as a former gang leader even if the Jets are the Dead End Kids with ballet training.

Why do so many high schools perform this play? Why do so many drama teachers that I've talked to teach entire units on it? Why have I seen boys cry or get inconsolably upset when they don't get the chance to be Riff or Tony? Because West Side Story is a timeless masterpiece that speaks to all generations. It involves true emotions of love, hate and revenge. Yet, their is a familiarity to it. At some point in time we've all felt like at least one or two of the characters. We have all lived to see something we regret, something that leaves us to shocked we cannot find words. West Side Story, its music, the dancing, the unforgettable characters...it all adds up.

It was just hammy and ridiculous but in a boring secondhand embarrassment kind of way but I wish I liked it so bad because it is such a cultural staple GRRRR. The casting is odd to be honest I think it is very silly to cast almost entirely white people as Puerto Ricans like . That was certainly a choice.

188,arbarnes,Plays it cool...,9,21 February 2009,"""West Side Story"" has an eternal sort of resonance in its theme and story, which we can thank Mr Shakespeare for, but also stands as a powerful product of its age and location. It is classic Broadway and classic Hollywood in its most urban musical style, often harsh and dangerous, but containing enough old-style production-number work to satisfy traditional film-musical aficionados. The opening sequence is one of the best film openings of all time, and the dancing (and direction of the dance sequences) incredibly exuberant and yet clear in its purpose. There is little cross-cutting and fast-editing here, yet the dances have all the energy of any modern music video. The film also interestingly has supporting characters who outshine the leads. Unlike many other comments here, I have nothing against either Natalie Wood or Richard Beymer in these parts; they are in many ways given an unfair deal in their very characterization (which I regard as something of a weakness in Romeo and Juliet, upon which the film is based). Their characters are simply not as interesting as those around them. Under the circumstances I think they do as good a job as they can.

Giving it a more modern edge and updating the lingo from Shakespearean time makes it a lot easier to relate to the characters and story line. Even watching the movie now in 2014 it still reflects upon issues that still matter today, such as immigration. The musical numbers are dramatic and get the point across.

The things that the gangs did were kind of accurate. They would have been more aggressive than what this movie portrays them as.

However, of all the reviews I have read here, hardly a one makes mention of the composer of the music in the film, Leonard Bernstein's music... The melodies are beautiful and romantic beyond compare. Bernstein was a genius, a great composer and conductor of orchestras... Stephen Sondheim had penned the lyrics, but the music came from Bernstein. Well known in the world of classical music, as a conductor he had championed a number of classical musicians, and he was a powerful prominent force on the International and New York orchestral music scene. A man of supreme importance in the field of classical music interpretation.

193,horror3333,The best and most influential musical of all time! (SPOILERS),10,27 July 2004,"(SPOILERS) Where can I possibly begin? West Side Story is an absolute classic! It is also one of the most influential movies/musicals of all time. How many musicals have won 10 Academy Awards? It has a wonderful mix of dancing and music, and the acting was perfect. It is a Romeo and Juliet type story, set in New York City in the 50s (Even though the movie was made in the 60s). There are two gangs (At least that we know of): The Jets and The Sharks. The Jets are white American boys, and the Sharks are all Puerto Rican. You can't really say that the Jets are the heroes, though; they hate the Sharks because of their race, and that's why the Sharks hate them, so there really are no bad guys in this movie. Riff (Russ Tamblyn) is the leader of the Jets, and Bernardo (George Chakiris, in an Oscar winning performance) is the leader of the Sharks. One day the Jets decide that they have had enough of the Sharks, and want to challenge them to a rumble. Riff knows that they need former Jet Tony (Richard Beymer) to help them out, but Tony has a job at the candy store, and doesn't really want to be in the gang anymore. However, he agrees to go to a dance that night at the gym. Bernardo is there with his girlfriend Anita (Rita Moreno, who also got an Oscar for her performance), as well as his gang. Of course the Jets are all there with their girlfriends, and the two gangs have a dance off. During the dance off, Tony spots Bernardo's sister Maria (Natalie Wood), and he is smitten. She too feels something for Tony. However, Tony does not know that Maria is is Bernardo's sister, and of course trouble erupts. Tony and Maria try to see each other as often as they can, but are forbidden to by their families. A few hours before the rumble, Maria learns of it, and asks Tony to help the Jets and Sharks stop it. Tony tries to do so, but Bernardo and Riff keep fighting. They each pull out switchblades, and Riff is killed by Bernardo. Bernardo just stands there, shocked at what he has done. Outraged, Tony grabs Riff's blade, and kills Bernardo, causing both gangs to fight with each other. The cops come, and everyone escapes. Maria waits at her home for Tony, only to have Bernardo's best friend and sidekick Chino (Jose De Vega) tell her that Tony murdered her brother. When Tony shows up, Maria yells at beats at him, only to fall into his arms and embrace him. When they hear Anita coming in, Tony escapes out of the window, but Anita sees him running, and tells Maria that a boy who kills can have no feelings. Realizing that Maria and Tony are in love, Anita goes to Doc's candy store to tell Tony that Chino is now after him with a gun, but is abused by the Jets. Furious, she tells them to tell Tony that a jealous Chino shot Maria and killed her. When Tony hears about this, he runs through the streets yelling ""Come and get me too, Chino!"" He is about to give up, when he sees Maria running towards him. Overjoyed, he runs too her, but they are both too late. Chino has seen them, and he fires his gun, shooting Tony in the stomach. Both gangs here the shots, and run to the playground, only too see Tony dying in Maria's arms. She tells them all that they kill each other not with weapons, but with hate. They all realize that she is right, and members of the Jets and Sharks carry Tony's body away with the police. Maria finally stands, and walks away, knowing that she will be strong and live through the pain. Not only is this entertaining movie a masterpiece, it is also very moving. If you haven't seen this movie, you have to go out as soon as possible and rent it! You will not be disappointed! 10/10.",West Side Story
194,cadenixo,Booooo *throws tomato*,2,1 April 2019,This movie was very hard watch. It was defiantly not for me it didn't do much for me and I didn't enjoy it. I've heard many good things about this movie but when it got down to me seeing it I hated it because it dragged on forever. The acting was also very bad and was hard to watch let alone listen to the singing was very annoying and overused. The plot of the movie is about 2 star crossed lovers who cant be together because they belong to different gangs with a huge feud. They end up having a rumble which is just a fight and a few people died. Overall the movie was not fun to watch I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you like bad musicals.,West Side Story

So why do I dislike (hate is a little too strong albeit close) this movie so much?Well maybe it's because West Side Story isn't really a musical, but a musical is what the filmmakers produced.The various elements involved in producing a theatrical work (music, dance, drama, etc.) are all so closely entwined in the West Side Story that I love, they really can't be separated. It's a ballet. It's a drama. It's an opera. Musical numbers appear so seamlessly that it can be hard to define exactly where they began. Musical numbers may morph into fantasy dance sequences with similar ambiguity, and it can all come back to spoken reality just as unexpectedly.The people that made this film wanted everything clearly defined, and it has the effect of a loud belch during a dramatic soliloquy. The flow of things is constantly interrupted. The dance starts here. The next song starts here. Here's where the dramatic scene begins. It's too bad really, because a successful stage production is tricky owing to the kinds of transitions that must be made. One would think that film would be a great medium to realize the kind subtlety the material demands. Sadly, a musical (i.e. a bunch of songs in between spoken drama) is what got made.A case in point: the song 'Somewhere'. On stage, this starts in Maria's room and goes through much before landing in a dream world where the song is sung by an offstage voice. The dream is finally consumed by the nightmare of the earlier rumble in which some important loved ones are killed. This interruption jolts them back into Maria's room where they must decide how to deal with the reality. In the movie, it is reduced to a sappy love song duet that is embarrassingly trite compared to the original ('cinematic' it always seemed to me) concept they dropped.That's not the only example of such ham-handedness in the film, but, to me, it is the most unforgivably stupid.This isn't to say there is nothing redeeming in the whole film. The source material is too good to lose all of its power just because a bunch of trolls laid their inept claws on it. I particularly liked Ned Glass as Doc. This movie could have been immeasurably better, though.",West Side Story

West Side Story in a nutshell. It's themes of racial bigotry and teenage delinquency were real problems back then, making it so much more important, and still a good film to watch now. The fact that the audience is led to see the film as American vs Puerto Rican as well as Jets vs Sharks, when it's all shown in the end it's all about everyone vs themselves.",West Side Story
199,atmoore-75075,Movie Review: West Side Story,7,28 October 2020,"West Side Story is about two New York street gangs and how a member of the one falls in love with the sister of a rival gang member. The plot is like a modern retelling of the classic Romeo and Juliet story, however this movie involves a lot of musical numbers that help flesh out a lot of the characters and how they feel about the situation that they are in. This movie is considered one of the best musicals of its time and many people who have watched this film still remember a lot of the musical numbers that were performed. When I first watched this movie a few years ago, I didn't really care for it however, watching it again made me realize why a lot of people really like this movie. I would definitely recommend this movie to anybody who likes musicals or romantic dramas.",West Side Story
200,jamesfalace,One of the greatest musicals,9,4 November 2020,"West side story is a great gang/love story mix which has a lot of ups and downs. I really enjoyed the build up of tension between the gangs, especially the opening scenes where they introduce them all and how the tension grows further at the dance with Tony and Maria Kissing. I think they did a great job with story telling and I really like how a member of each side fall in love which makes the movie more suspenseful. Some of the songs were corny in my opinion but majority of them were pretty good and did it's job. I disliked the ending because I wanted there to be a happy ending and see Tony and Maria go on to live their own life but it is what it is. I'd still give this a movie a 9 regardless because of how classic and how it captures the viewers attention. Would recommend",West Side Story
201,marvelousgab,West Side Story,9,13 November 2020,I have seen this film many times and it never gets old. The story is based on the Shakespeare classic Romeo and Juliet. They make this story more modern and somewhat more controversial. It is a great film.,West Side Story

I can't get past the fact that almost all of the actors are non-hispanics with the exception of the marvelous Rita Moreno. Horrible brown makeup on everyone. Thank God, we've come a long way from 60's Hollywood.",West Side Story
203,ericagui,West Side Story,2,5 April 2019,I thought this movie was awful and very cringe worthy. This movie was practically a modern day Romeo and Juliet. There are two separate gangs that battle for different sets of areas. The problem that begins to happen is when one of members of the other gang falls in love with other. The director to this movie is Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise. I don't really think both of these guys did such a great job. There are a lot of main actors but I think one of these most noticeable ones would have to be George Chakiris he did an okay role and I thought he was the best one out of all them. Overall I wouldn't recommend this movie to anybody. I didn't really like this movie at all and wouldn't have watched this outside of school just the intro to get into the movie felt to long.,West Side Story
204,rose-18,outstanding! truly realizes the insanity of hate and prejudice,2,6 July 1999,"The first time I saw West Side Story, I was nine. It didn't make a huge impression on me, mostly because, knowing the ultimate outcome of Romeo and Juliet, I waited for that ending to happen, which it didn't exactly. I am now 15, and when I watched it this time, I loved it so much that it became one of my favorite films. While I haven't seen Singin in the Rain recently enough to compare it, this is without a doubt one of the very greatest musicals ever made. The entire film is stunning, a model of great cinematography, editing, production. The music is unforgettable, the choreography is brilliant, and the acting is topnotch. And does it make you cry! A must-see, but wait until you are somewhat older than nine!",West Side Story
205,Muskox53,Embarrassingly bad (but prizewinning) adaptation of so-so musical version of Romeo & Juliet,6,26 April 2004,"Many critics and viewers have sung this film's praises, as relevant and groundbreaking-a musical for someone who doesn't like musicals. It won many Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director, but it's hard to see why. The film is awkward, unimaginative, and flat; it preserves many of the defects of the musical it adapts, with many new shortcomings of its own devising.The 1957 musical was an updating of Romeo and Juliet to the 50s of gangs and zip-guns. Unfortunately, this kind of ""updating"" soon seems hopelessly dated; the film attempts a further updating to the early 60s, with the same result. That's the amazing thing about Shakespeare's original; as Baz Luhrmann showed, it doesn't need updating, but transcends its time. West Side Story, however, is a period piece.The musical changes the original story, in an attempt to make it socially relevant-but instead leeches out the power and poignancy. The Montague/ Capulet feud, over some trivial personal slight, long forgotten, is transformed into a racial conflict, a battle between established and recent immigrants; One of Shakespeare's points is that such a personal feud might possibly be healed by guilt over some needless deaths. But a racial conflict isn't going to go away just because Maria accuses both gangs of recklessness. Unfortunately, the play pretends that this kind of simplistic reconciliation can happen.and this passes for realism or relevance? Would anyone find the ending realistic if it were set in Northern Ireland, or in Palestine? Come off it!Another revealing change: both Romeo and Juliet die, suicides in despair at the thought of life without transcendent love. Maria does not kill herself, but survives to call both Jets and Sharks to reconciliation at the end. In Shakespeare, this call comes from the civil and religious authorities, and the reconciliation comes about only when the feuding leaders finally submit to these authorities. In West Side Story, there are no authorities that anybody could submit to; the parents are nonexistent, the police are figures to be mocked, and Friar Laurence has been transformed into Doc, a cranky old shopkeeper who has no counsel to offer other than ""When are you kids going to grow up!"" Most of the ""updated"" dialogue is of this sort-replacing timeless poetry with slangy inanities.There are many such flaws in the musical (including Bernstein's stylistic indecision; he vacillated between writing sharp-edged jazz and slurpy romantic ballads, but at least most of the music is fairly interesting), but the film outdoes them all in its quest to be cinematic and realistic.  So we are treated to a dozen or so well-groomed dancers leaping and prancing through Hollywood-realistic city-street sets. Realism? how long would these guys last if they tried dancing like this through the real West Side? They don't look realistic at all, just silly.The most effective scenes are those that are most like a filmed stage-play, with a fairly static camera and the dancers confined to a well-defined set. ""America"" is done on a rooftop, ""Officer Krupke"" is set on a single front stoop, and the Dance at the Gym [aka the Capulet's Ball] is genuinely exciting. Presumably both of these were directly inspired by the original choreography; at any rate they are the least cinematic, and the most successful.The much-touted cinematic effects look cheap and desperately unimaginative. No one could think of anything more interesting to do during the Overture than cycle the stylized graphic of Manhattan through various primary colours, changing every minute or so, for no apparent reason? The opening music accompanies overhead shots of many different locations in New York (including Yankee Stadium, and the UN building); why? Tony sings ""Something's Coming"" in front of a shoddy back-projection of streets, unmotivated by anything in the song, and looks like he's riding through a Tunnel of Love. The haloing of Tony and Maria when they first meet at the dance might have been a novel effect in the 1930s, but in 1961 it looks like something out of a student effort.Of course, any time Tony or Maria are on the screen a discerning viewer wants to run and hide anyway. Neither Richard Beymer nor Natalie Wood has the slightest degree of charisma, neither can sing (their songs had to be dubbed, with no attempt made to match the vocal timbres, or even to make it look like they were really singing), neither can dance (ensembles dance around them, while they hardly move), Wood's attempt to affect a Puerto Rican accent is embarrassing to say the least. So this timeless love story has a great big zero at its heart: two central characters about whom no one really gives a hoot, and who lack any ability to grab your attention. (The second leads are much better, esp. George Chakiris, not a Latino by the way, as Bernardo, aka Tybalt, the leader of the Puerto Ricans.)What were the producers and casting people thinking?  Probably they started believing their own hype, that this was inevitably going to be a great timeless film, and they opted for names rather than talent. Even if they thought the world really needed a film version of this so-so musical, they would have been better off just filming a stage production, with real singers and actors, and dancers dancing where they belonged, on a stage.This isn't a great film, and it certainly isn't a great film musical. If you want to see one of those, try Singing in the Rain, or Top Hat, or The Band Wagon, or A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, or Moulin Rouge.",West Side Story

The plot is exceptional, the acting is remarkable, the music is some of the best of all time, the characters are very sympathetic, and can make you laugh uproariously at times and make you weep for them at others. The ending is dynamite, so I won't spoil it for anyone who may have missed this must-see film.",West Side Story
207,ctcpolo,West Side Story,10,1 April 2021,"West Side Story has a big cast, a variety of singing and dancing, all while telling the story perfectly with all these elements. The sets used are always beautifully painted, but are just nondescript enough to be interesting and also be a perfect stage. There are a few sets that sty constant throughout, but there is also a lot of different backdrops, this just adds another element of interest to this film. The actors are able to display emotion, but the singing and dance really helps lift up the anguish and emotions that the characters are feeling throughout. The movie seems absurd at times, with these boyish looking characters playing out this 'Gangster life', but you get used to it, and its just something interesting I noticed about the film.",West Side Story

Why not just have that at the end while the credits play? But that is not even close to being the worst part. The snapping in an attempt to seem imitating was just stupid. They looked ridiculous. And the ballet dancing through the streets...that was just awful. I felt physical pain watching them prance around talking about how hard life is and how bad they are. It was so contradictory and just downright awful. This was especially true in the ""You're A Jet"" number. The singing was sub-par and the acting and dancing were ridiculous. I will say, though, that the ""America"" number was entertaining, but the dancing was, again, ridiculous.",West Side Story

It retells the somewhat-tired story of Romeo and Juliet in an exciting new way. The musical is theatrical and fun while also telling the dramatic story of love and death. The singers and actors do fantastically in their roles, with many unforgettable musical numbers. Even if you know the story of the Shakespearean play on which this is set, West Side Story still manages to capture the viewer and make them feel for the characters. West Side Story is a must watch.",West Side Story

It's been a long time since I had so much fun watching a motion picture.  I was singing, I was dancing, and I was loving every minute of it.West Side Story takes some pages from Romeo and Juliet and adds its own style, substance, and overall fun.  Didn't Shakespeare's play bring you down a bit?  Well, West Side Story will have you up!  Whether you're a Jet or a Shark; a White or a P.R...  It don't matter, baby.  You're going to love this movie.  It was made over 40 years ago and it still hasn't gotten old. The people involved in production were experts and it definitely shows.Now, vote an excellent 10 for West Side Story and get it in the Top 250.  If you don't, you're just like Officer Krupke.

Because I missed some of the show and they got to the top ten I was convinced that I had missed it or it hadnt made the list ......When they got to # 2 and the music started I was the one dancing in the street!. I don't care if the movie was dubbed and it took nearly 40 years to admit it.I have had a crush on Richard Beymer for years and have found myself championing his performance in West Side Story for ages.(Not that he needs it). I was watchin the movie for the umpteenth time ,and decided to look up reviews of the original stage play...I found many similar comments about Larry Kert's performance that were so familiar to Richards.Then it hit me.... There is not an actor who has ever played Tony that could have done any more with the part.Its the way its written. Tony,like Romeo is a  fish out of water, searching for something that no one understands.  So give that a rest,ok!  George Chakiris and Rita Moreno pretty much do steal the show, and Russ Tamblyn looks like he's having so much fun...The character  I really like the best is Anybodys,the girl Jet wannabe,and no I am not a tomboy. When she rescues Tony from the Sharks after the Rumble....(I think her name is Sue Oakes ,and I never saw her in anything else.  Ned Glass as Doc and Simon Oakland as Krupke are also excellent.

The opening scene was done very well, the way they panned the camera through the city until they got to the west side. One scene really stuck out to me, I laughed a lot.

215,wbthockey,Modern twist on Romeo and Juliet,10,28 October 2020,"This was the first time I actually sat down and watch this movie and after watching it, it is one of my top 5 favorite musicals as a movie. Natalie Wood and Richard Beymers did phenomenal in their roles as 'Romeo' (Tony) and 'Juliet' (Maria). I thought it was cool that I can now connect the song ""I feel pretty"" with this movie because I've always heard that song, but I never knew who sang it or where it came from.
This movie also made me tear up just like ""Romeo and Juliet"" because you get so immerse in these characters that you feel like you are there in the moment and a character dies off, you start to sob either because they were your favorite character, or because they played such a huge role in the scene.

The vivid colors and over enthusiastic choreography, it is almost humorous but instead just fills you with joy and the urge to get up and sing along.This movie is fantastic simply because its contains great qualities that appeal to audiences. It is wonderfully colorful. The saturation in this feels exuberant as the colors wash over your eyes. The outfits are bright with yellows, reds, and purples. This film visually is satisfying of course, however the real depth comes in the music. The songs are exciting and make the film feel very fast paced with the constant choreography. It definitely gives it the extra character beyond the plot and visuals. The plot is a classic, Romeo and Juliet variation. I will always enjoy that story because it has a way to bring feeling to romance unlike any other story.Overall, this movie is phenomenal no matter how many times you watch it. It also makes me appreciate the newer musicals more too, such as La La Land.",West Side Story

What is so, so sad about this sixty year old film is how much it resonates with our world today. Hate ruled the lives of two groups of young people. Tony, a White boy and Maria, a Puerto Rican girl, could not be together, safely, in their world. They poignantly sang about finding ""somewhere"" to live, and to love.

The first ten minutes we see the gangs converging, snapping fingers and breaking out into some bizarre, prancy type of dance. As far as street toughs go, these guys couldn't even frighten my old aunt Ethel.  I just couldn't buy into everything.  Maybe this movie was ahead of it's time (see Micheal Jackson's Beat It video), but  I don't like my street toughs dancing around like Barishnakov.  Based on this, I give it the boot.

221,shanie25350,"Enjoyed the modern and edgy dance numbers, but found it interminable",6,6 October 2021,"Okay, but overrated, unevenly paced, and very slow at times. I enjoy musicals (both staged and filmed versions) and I'm usually in awe of old Hollywood musicals--especially those spectacular MGM productions, but I'm very surprised that West Side Story was ranked by the AFI as the second greatest movie musical of all time, right after Singing in the Rain.I realize that West Side Story was made in 1961, after the golden age of Hollywood musicals and also at time when racial tensions were running high. I also realize that some people today might object to the ethnically-incorrect casting of the main characters and that Rita Moreno was the only Puerto Rican actor/actress in the movie, but I still appreciate the fact that this film tackled issues of race and immigration, which are still relevant today. I also thought that Natalie Wood, Rita Moreno, and Russ Tamblyn were all great in the film.My main problem with West Side Story is that it's interminable at 2.5 hours (they even have an ""intermission"") and would have been much more exciting and compelling if they had cut 30 minutes out. The dance numbers are enjoyable and very modern and edgy for 1961, but some of the slow scenes drag and don't add much to the storyline. Also, the well-known songs are good, but some of the music is forgettable, cacophonous, and downright annoying.

I remember being captivated by it as a child, and the older I got the more I understood about what was happening in the movie, how it was more than just love and songs and great dancing. It's about passion and fire taking over all reason. About how hard it is to be young and to accept the world we live in. Some people I know will never get past the dancing or the ""breaking into song"" - thinking that just makes it look stupid, that it's not realistic, etc. But that never stopped the opera or the ballet, so why should musical theater be laughed at for interpreting movement through dance? I think that if you can get past the ""unrealities"" and try not to compare it too much to ""Romeo and Juliet"" and just let yourself understand the content of the film as a whole, ""West Side Story"" will be a beautiful experience. I don't think I will ever get through the movie without shedding a tear.",West Side Story

I wish to add my comments to this movie. This is perhaps one of the best movies that I have ever seen, and most certainly deserves the title `best musical ever'. The music and the songs are excellent, as is the choreography and the acting. Every move the actors/actresses make are made to the best possible effect.
There is also one more comment that I wish to make and that is that as I was watching the film I kept getting the overwhelming feeling that the film is very, very anti-American and anti-American way of life, which seems strange for the medium that it is brought across in. this comes across mostly in two scenes, one when the police lieutenant is racially harassing the Puerto Ricans (`PRs') but especially in the song, aptly named `America'.

Robert Wise's impeccable craftsmanship again shines through, and the rest of the crew reads like a Hollywood Deam Team: Sondheim/Bernstein/Lehman/Robbins. Its a shame that even in 1961, the lyrics had to be watered-down for political correctness. God knows what a re-make would be like today. Maybe Quentin Tarantino could make a good stab at a high-gloss update, where inner-city gangs DON'T spontaneously break into ballet dance numbers, and incessant finger-snapping.

The entire rest of your career becomes irrelevant because you know that you'll never be able to duplicate what you just did, ever again!Perhaps that what Leonard Bernstein felt.

The first part of the movie was too long without, apparently, any point, up until the dance (come on, if this is truly Romeo and Juliet, why no ""bite my thumb"" scene at the beginning?).The only saving grace of this travesty of a production was the music and the dancing, and I don't watch movies solely for that. Even Maria's final bit in the last scene where Tony is killed doesn't satisfy, because it's underdone, and there's no ""glooming peace this morning with it brings"" speech at the end.",West Side Story

The west side story is a musical created in the famous Hollywood. It involves a lot of dancing between two gangs. One gang is the Puerto Ricans led by Bernardo and the other gang is called the jets led by tony. It's an adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. Tony falls in love with Bernardo younger sister. Which causes conflict between the two gangs. Tragedy has brought the two gangs to an end. I recommend giving this movie a watch.,West Side Story

230,vigcyn-665-195614,The casting director should have listened to Natalie Wood,5,21 April 2013,"The major problem with this picture is the painful lack of chemistry between the two leads, Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer. Wood was very young (23) and just not accomplished enough as an actress to hide her anathema toward Beymer. She wanted her lover at that time, Warren Beatty, in the lead and thought Beymer should be fired. I have to concede she was right. He is oddly graceless and clunky in this part. Kind of a dork. Certainly not believable as a gang member. I'm no fan of Warren Beatty, but the film would have been a lot more compelling if he'd played the lead. There was not an ounce of real passion between Tony and Maria. All their scenes together are duds, and that detracted terribly from the story.",West Side Story

Tony and Maria deserved it each other so much. The prejudice between the whites and Hispanics grew so highly that people get killed. It has a great meaning and beautiful music.

234,fanny92,Pretty Ridiculous,3,8 May 2019,"My dad told me about this movie when I was younger and it has always sounded really interesting to me. He grew up listening to the soundtrack and still has some of the songs memorized. I was really excited to watch it for the first time, plus I really like musicals, so I was hoping that it would go on my list of favorites. I was pretty disappointed when I actually watched it. I don't know what I was expecting, because it is an old movie, and based off of Romeo and Juliet, but I just thought it would be cooler, based on how my dad had described it.
This story is based on the play Romeo and Juliet. The ""Juliet"" character is Maria, and the ""Romeo"" character is Tony. It is set in New York City and the two opposing groups are gangs, the Jets and the Sharks.
There isn't a lot of hard history in this movie, but it illustrates discrimination at that time of Puerto Ricans who had moved to the United States. That little tidbit of history was pretty interesting to me. It really relates to history before that and what it is like now. It illustrated the discrimination that happens to many different groups.
The directors of this movie are Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise. I haven't seen any other movies made by Jerome Robbins, but I have seen The Sound of Music which was directed by Robert Wise. The main actors in this movie are Natalie Wood, Richard Beymer, Rita Moreno, George Chakiris, and Russ Tamblyn. I have seen Richard Beymer in Johnny Tremain and Russ Tamblyn in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers. I didn't really like them a super lot in this movie, but I liked them in the other movies I have seen them in. My favorite scene in this movie, is the scene where Bernardo and his friends are singing ""America"". I just really liked the song and I thought it was a fun scene. The choreography was pretty cool.
This wasn't really my favorite movie. It was super unrealistic, which makes sense because it is based off of Romeo and Juliet, but I just think that story it kind of ridiculous. I liked some of the songs, but a lot of them were weird. Same with the choreography. Some of it was good, but some of it was weird. I also didn't feel really attached to any of the characters.",West Side Story

Looking over my tapes, I decided it was time to visit West Side Story again, after some years. It was a fine choice. I would catch myself with my hands idle, as my eyes tracked the dancing, the most dynamic part of the film. I reveled in the Sharks on the rooftop and the gymnasium dance. ""Cool"" was cool, as always. This is a musical that doesn't try to transcend itself. It just lets the music and dancing speak for itself (and offkey singing along is allowed at home). I've always felt that Richard Beymer was the weakest of the actors, and nothing has changed my mind. But he's easy to ignore in comparison to the outstanding performances of George Chakiris, Rita Morena (who dominates the screen and steals all her scenes), Russ Tamblyn and the rest of the supporting cast. I'll leave the experts to make the minute comparisons to Romeo and Juliet, and to the critics to point out all the flaws.

In all seriousness when I finally got used to this juxtaposition the movie turned out to be a create colorful extravagant spectacle. The singing and dancing numbers of the gangs were always entertaining as they were able to successfully combine the comedy of a song and dance routine and the drama of gang violence, a great combination.While the singing and dance is great the plot is also great, if you don't include the Romeo and Juliet parts.

One can tell how race can show how people interact with each other. This movie also shows very conservative mindset of not mixing with an other race. The movie also show how this type of mindset effected people and what people had to deal with when they mix with other mindsets. This is still a problem people have to deal with in other countries, like Brazil. The movie was pretty good but it felt like it was a play on a very fake stage.",West Side Story
238,essmeier,Weak and stagey,3,30 May 2001,"The first ten minutes are great - the opening sequence on the playground plays like some bizarre urban ballet....and then they move indoors.  Most of this film was shot on soundstages, and the directors made no effort to make it look like anything other than what it was - a filmed play.  Any effort at all to shoot outdoor scenes outdoors would have improved the film considerably.  Instead, we're left with a film that hasn't a shred of realism.      There's no chemistry between the leads (Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood) and one can't help but wonder how two people, acquainted for a mere 24 hours (and who have spent perhaps 15 minutes together in that time), could be so ""in love.""  When she finds out that Beymer has just killed her brother, she dismisses it with hardly a comment.  It reeks of phoniness.     Most of the songs are OK, although I feel compelled to point out that ""Officer Krupke"" just may be the worst song ever written.  The dialogue, in trying to sound hip, instead sounds forced, and probably sounded phony even in 1961.  Finally, most of the Jets just don't seem like gang types. Imagine Wally and Beaver Cleaver as murderers and you have some concept of the Jets.      All in all, a colossal misfire, and one of the Academy's Best Picture blunders of all time.  3/10",West Side Story
239,Brodie_500,Intense passion in the dance but none in the drama,5,8 December 2004,"West Side Story oscillates unevenly between two moods. One is riveting, bustling with an energy fueled by highly stylised movement and dance, but bottled by the great, imprisoning nature of the set design. The effect makes the successful dance numbers explosive, particularly 'Cool' and 'America'. The players thrust and throw their hands with abandon and defiance, their movements violent and impassioned. Where the film fails is in transporting this passion to the love story that forms the entire basis of the Romeo-and-Juliet plot. It's a forced and inauthentic affection, the flatness of which is only reinforced by a collection of feeble or just plain atrocious ballads (Maria, Tonight, and more). These shockingly poor tunes contribute to the blandness that besets the whole affair, further perpetuated by the blandest of leading men. Natalie Wood (who seems to old for the role) occasionally injects Maria with some wit and inner steel - most notably in the 'I Feel Pretty' sequence. For the most part, however, she cannot dispel the fundamental wetness of the role; she emits a sense of feminine helplessness that is most suggested in the insufferably 'angelic' nature of her singing. The lackluster scenes with the lovers drain the film from its full-bloodiness; it takes the spark of Rita Moreno and the other supporting characters (however amateurish the acting) to jolt the film back into life.There are some rousing, superlative dance sequences, but the fever they stir ultimately dissipates for the filmmakers to mechanically pump out the humdrum denouement to the contrived tragic trajectory of this, the soggiest of romances.5 / 10",West Side Story
240,dinesh_cena1989,A Wood romance is always a winning romance,8,8 October 2007,"WEST SIDE STORY was by chance. The picture was up for a rent. Seeing it for the first time, I thought some scenes were somehow not necessary. However, this masterpiece( as it can be rightly called ) was a sure good one.THE PLOT: A typical Romeo and Juliet drama set between arch rivals the Jets and the Sharks. The Puerto Rican SHARKS leader Bernardo has a love for his precious sister Maria. Riff, the JETS leader is strong and good-willed in his own way. When the SHARKS' Tony falls for Maria, it's like fish meeting water all the way. The Romeo and Juliet like encounters between the two. The passion they have for each other etc is profound and quite impressive. When a fight kills the leaders of the two gangs, mysterious events happen and the love cycle continues to struggle till the last moment it can.A Robert Wise picture is always very lively and heart-felt. We are reminded that love is a force of nature and it's not in the power of a human being to pull it apart. WEST SIDE STORY somehow triumphs with it's redeeming sense of love. Though in my eyes, a little unoriginal, (in terms of the familiar Romeo and Juliet romance) It succeeds by pulling at your heartstrings hard and tenderly.8/10. = A-",West Side Story

From the first fight, I started to realize that the whole thing was unbelievably corny. Well dressed teens hanging around a playground. If they were so bored--- get a job. The Sharks complaining about how badly they were treated in ""America."" OK-- what were they doing to improve their situation? Gang fighting? Every scene was painful to watch.

There was a scene that I thought was okay and it was when they were all trying to fight then one of the guys comes to split the fight up. Also since it is an older movie the sets and acting is quite the showing. This movie is about love and hate. There's like ""gangs"" and they just want to protect their people and their parts of the town, there's a lot of rivalry going on in the movie until some people get killed at the end of the movie. I don't enjoy older movies like this or musicals in general but it was okay but yet I wouldn't watch it outside of class or probably ever.

they are masterpieces. The quality of the shots is amazing, capturing all of the details in what is a classic New York city filled with gang violence. The pivot from real violence through music sets this musical apart from a gang movie, and adds to the surprising ending. My favorite score being, ""I want to live in America"", was a great descriptor of the American dream being wanted by all but the native Americans. In a remark made about moving back to San Juan, a rhetorical comeback of them all being here sets the scene on the view of ethics during this time.The music is stupendous, the choreography is spectacular, and the vibes are all great.

252,eawelkley,An American Classic,10,16 November 2020,"West Side Story is one of those quintessentially American films. It is steeped in the culture of late 1950's America, when the nation was still riding high off of our victory in WW2 and everything seemed perfect (seemed being the key word there) and it is as much of a trailblazer for the world of cinema as the original stage show was for live theater. While West Side Story is itself a retelling of Romeo and Juliet; with the Capulets and Montagues being replaced with the Jets and the Sharks, and the story taking place in the titular Upper West Side of Manhattan in place of Verona, in my opinion, the love story in West Side is far more believable and emotional and the ending is only slightly less saddening. I had heard the film's soundtrack before watching it, but that was years ago, so when I did sit down to watch it, it was completely new and mesmerizing to me. I especially loved the opening scene, as the camera pans over Manhattan, giving us a bird's eye view of the island moving toward the West Side as we hear the sonorous whistle that became one of the many iconic sounds of the movie. And while this movie may have invented the concept of ""tough guy finger snapping"", I lament that I still don't know how to snap my fingers properly, because when I finished the movie, I wanted to just aggressively walk down my hallway doing just that. To me, the mark of a good musical is if it manages to get at least one song stuck in your head. In my case, that was America. Not only is it a great song, but the lyrics can remind you of some of the uncomfortable truths about this nation, and any work of art that makes you think is the truest form of art to me. Highly recommended to fans of musicals, romantic storylines, or even to people who aren't a fan of those and just want a fun classic movie to watch.

Cinematography was fantastic (makes me want to go back there for an Egg Cream).Now for the not necessarily bad but somewhat inconceivable: The ""Romeo and Juliet in Hell's Kitchen"" angle just doesn't work for me here. In real life, Tony would be dead meat, Maria would be pregnant with Chino's kid, and the whole bunch would be fighting in Queens, because I don't see any of them having the means to afford a broom-closet in Manhattan, lest they mugged a rent-controlled apartment occupant for the space.The only way I see these two gangs ever existing in real life New York is maybe if they were in Greenwich Village!

254,benaven,My First Musical Review!,5,29 September 2011,"Let me say at outset that musicals aren't really my thing. Too artificial for me. That accusation could be levelled at just about any Sci Fi film of course, but we're all different! A year or so ago I told myself to watch some musicals to see if I could love them (at the age of 47!), and have since seen Cabaret (loved it), the Sound of Music (very good) and Singin' In The Rain (fantastic), so hopes were high for WSS. It gets off to a belting start with the mysterious graphic (""what is it?!!) and has some great moments. The photography and sets are first class, some of the music & dance scenes have terrific energy and vibrance. For a film ""of its time"" it is a great period piece and tells us of the emergence of rebellious youth who don't anymore quake in their boots when the police arrive on the scene. So, why the 5 stars? For me there are just too many songs. The 3 musicals mentioned above felt like a film with a few songs; WSS felt like song & dance with a film tacked on the side. As the titles rolled, my Mrs said ""What a sad ending"" but I hadn't felt it at all. I'd seen ""Everybody's Fine"" the night before and that is sad towards the end, but not this. The reason is that apart from Natalie Wood's character I just couldn't relate to any of the characters as they felt so artificial to me. Anybody that breaks into song in even the most traumatic of situations feels remote to me, so much so that I couldn't really care what became of them. Anyway, WSS gets a score of 7.7 on IMDb (at time of writing in Sept '11) so I'm clearly in the minority! I'm glad I've seen it & I can imagine for the musical lover it is a must-see.

262,SanForZeke,One could talk about this movie forever,10,29 July 2008,"Spoilers: This movie is the timeless movie. No matter how many times I watch the Jets (or Sharks) moving or dancing over the streets, I never get tired of it. The prologue is one of the best, with the Jets surveying their turf, the others gets out of the gang members path as the music speeds up, one can really feel ""this is their street and they love it"". Enter Bernardo, and the music tones down to a more strained note.. ""this is the enemy."" Bernardo goes and gets his own friends, and the music speeds up as the Sharks moves across the Jets sign, a clear challenge. Then it continues on, until the inevitable fight at the ballpark, from which the story continues, and the rumble and the aftermath approaches.Even though I was no fan of the Tony/Maria story, I can watch this movie with absolute anticipation every time, due to all the other characters: Ice: the cool-est gang member ever, Anybodys: the persistent tomboy who wants to be a jet, Bernardo: a chilly adversary and Action: the brooding gang member with anger issues.And the songs.. Cool, Officer Krupke, The Quintet, the Jet Song.. if they don't keep you captured at the screen.. well, nothing will.All in all, a masterly done movie, where the music is as much a part of the success as the actors/characters.See this movie.",West Side Story

As it is very important and still relevant to today's world and the views between two people that come from different backgrounds. But, this is as musical as you could get, you can tell by the acting that they are trying to make it more like a Broadway show than a movie. But, I think this a definite good thing because it opened a floodgate to so much more like this and that's why it's a must see.

Yes, he's supposed to be an ordinary guy, but for me his acting does not come up to expectations. This may be an unfair prejudice on my part, but he just doesn't fit into the film.And what a film it is. I think I know all the songs by heart, at least to sing them along. The story is powerful from many aspects: the slums, the gangs, the pop psychology in the famous ""Officer Krupky"" song. The music is dynamic and the dances, especially ""America"" totally memorable. For some tastes today, everything might be a little too pat and the music definitely old-fashioned, but for its time, it was truly a great achievement and worthy of every Oscar it received.",West Side Story
268,Holly_OHara,"Great songs, great story - but see it on stage",6,8 January 2005,"This is the modern day Romeo and Juliet tale of two lovers who try to overcome the rivalries between the gangs they are from. The are also themes of the gang hostilities themselves, the relationships between other central characters such as the gang leaders and the sentiments of socially disadvantaged youth trying to find their own way in the world. This is all brought to life with the help of some original and memorable songs, including 'Tonight', 'America' and 'I Feel Pretty', to name but a few.I absolutely adore the stage version of this musical, so I was eager to watch the film. Obviously it stayed reasonably true to the script, although it was disorientating to hear a few of the songs sung in completely different parts of the film. The other problem is that it has not aged well. Many of the colours (both set and costume) just look garish today. Additionally, some of the acting seems a little overcooked, especially from Tony, the male lead.Having said that, the overall messages of the story, as well as the fantastic songs, do provide for enjoyable viewing and it is incredibly moving. However, (and I really am not being snobby!) I would recommend a trip to a theatre to watch it on stage if you want to get the full impact of this musical.",West Side Story
269,ArsLonga,"an education in everything: music, dance, cinematography",9,28 June 2006,"just watched it again today thanks to retroplex, and that makes my 60th (?) viewing since i first saw it as a 10-y-o in NYC in 1962. i agree with the featured reviewer, it needs to be heard at loud volume. almost everything in this film is extraordinary and was ground-breaking in its day: the Bernstein score and (whose???) lyrics, the Jerome Robbins choreography, the cinematography... not to mention the exploration of cultural differences which, at 10, i barely grasped but was seriously intrigued by.i had the record and know every note, lyric, and piece of dialogue by now. while it usually cheers me up (TCM shows it often enough), today i found myself weeping in the early part, 30 minutes in, where Bernstein so brilliantly uses the increasingly insistent xylophones to emphasize the growing frantic tension. i wept because i realized how much repeated listening and watching has taught me about music and dance, not to mention different cultures--the Jets were as foreign to me as the Sharks.it's intriguing to watch Eliot Feld, aka Baby John, who was not the best dancer in the group, but who went on to form his own ballet company, and the only minor cast member who achieved any success; all i can guess is that he became a protégé of Robbins... moreover, it is so clear that Michael Jackson stole, (or took inspiration from,) a number of scenes, for his videos. and not much became of many of the major stars; not Russ Tamblyn and Natalie Wood, but where did Richard Beymer vanish to? and Geo Chakiris didn't live up to his potential in the film.this is only the second time i've rated a film at 9. as with the Australian reviewer, i am a huge fan of musicals, but this is heads and tails above all others, incl. 42nd St. and Singin' in the Rain, because the music is so thoroughly integrated and the dancing is so remarkable.must admit: i no longer have patience for the sappy stuff like ""Maria"" and the first ""Tonight."" but John Astin's goofy role at the dance, Chita Rivera's stunning performances, and ""Officer Krupke"" allow me to forgive any and all few flaws.",West Side Story

My children have watched it on VHS of course and I was amazed that they liked it so well. I had some reservations about how they would react to it here in 2006. Musicals were not the in thing today.

274,Tony Dummett,An Uncompromisingly Great film,9,5 February 2005,"Although I think I've seen just about every musical there is from the forties to the seventies, I'd never seen West Side Story until last night. An amazing omission on my part, as having seen it, I just think it's simply wonderful.I bought the DVD ""on spec"" in a CD/DVD exchange store in Sydney for $10. I've had it in my hand a couple of times before but have always put it back on the shelf. This time I went through with the purchase and am now wondering what could have come over me, not buying it before.Those here who have said you really need to watch it on the Big Screen are absolutely right. In my case I watched it using a video projector throwing the image, big, bright and beautiful, onto a 12 foot screen. The photography used the wide screen format uncompromisingly. There was no caution here to frame the action for possible television cropping, or even much consideration given to a 2.35:1 ""Cinemascope"" presentation. Super Panavision's aspect ratio is not as wide as Cinemascope's 2.35:1, and every square inch of screen space was used for one or another important element of composition.Bernstein's music is a tour de force. Having watched On The Town only a few days back, it was interesting to contrast the two musicals. On The town is, of course, 15 years or so older than West side Story, but a comparison between the two scores is chalk and cheese. You could tell that Bernstein was holding himself back in On The Town. It wasn't his project. The numbers were almost self-censored. But West side Story was his baby, and it shows.The sheer brilliance of the music, the enchanting daring of it, its raucous atonality coupled with sweetness of melody are awesomely impressive, as show-stopper after show-stopper is thrown onto the screen to continually up the amazement quotient, time after time. I played West Side Story loud, very loud. The surround sound knocked my socks off from the opening aerial ambiance of Manhattan streets to the orchestrations themselves. I remember Bernstein in the documentary about the concert version of West Side Story saying, aside to the camera, after ""Cool, Boy"" was recorded, ""You know, this is pretty good..."" One of the great understatements, even if coming from the music's creator.See this film. Play it loud. Watch it on a big screen if you can. If you do you may, like I did, sit there thrilled, swinging your head from one side of the Super Panavision screen to the other, trying to take in the overwhelming avalanche coming at your eyes, your ears and your heart. It was an almost perfect transfer from film to DVD: color, sharpness, depth. It's been a long while since I've watched a film with a silly grin on my face right through, sometimes gasping at the sheer knock-out brilliance of what film-making can be at its best. West Side Story was one of those times.",West Side Story

I would just LOVE to know what is going to happen to all these people after all of this happens?What about Maria,will she ever fall in love after such a loss?

276,lifetimejuli,True Love to Tragedy,4,19 May 2009,"This is a musical film by director Jerome Robbins, who saw the opportunity to re-write a modern version of Romeo and Juliet play. But, to my opinion he fell short. If William Shakespeare ever saw this version he will be greatly disappointed with it. The lyrics, vocals, and the acting are incredibly poor. Mr. Robbins used the streets of the West side New York and their gangs, plus the fresh love between Maria, a Spanish Puerto Rican girl, who just moved into America played by the actress Natalie Wood and Tony an Italian boy play by the actor Richard Beymer to create the plot of this film. West Side Story does not remain true to THE END of its Shakespearean version, when Romeo and Juliet died. I cannot say that the film is bad, but I would just like to state that this film is not as equivalent as the amazing story of Romeo and Juliet, Just because it involves the ill-fated love affair between a young man and woman who in this case are racially prejudiced by the members of the gang and their family. Additionally, West Side Story asks their audience to believe that these groups of adults are teenagers, despite the fact that they're all somewhere around 30 years old. But, not all is a down fall in West Side Story. This film had some funny scenes, songs, and a lot of well done dance performances to enjoy. Also, this motion picture is shown exceptionally well the sad reality of the gangs and the deadly consequences of their actions. In addition, the ethnic tensions between the Puerto Rican (the Sharks) and the Anglo-Irish-Italian (the Jets) trying to out-macho one another sadly reflects our society's racial bias. If, this is the kind of subject that captures your attention, I will absolutely recommend this film.",West Side Story

It is totally out of context. But in the movie when boy meets girl they instantly fall in love and want to be together forever. The girl, Maria, has an older brother who is the leader of the Puerto Rican gang, the sharks, and has chosen her boyfriend for her. But as the girls break out into song they sing that they are in America and are free to do what they want. He forbids Maria from seeing Tony but they go behind his back.

When he finds out he. you have to see the movie: )It is one of the most famous, classical films I know. The movie had a mood that was irresistible. You couldn't help yourself from continuing to watch it. The dancing in the film was very dramatic and had a lot of energy in which I liked very much. The music was interesting.What I did not like about the film was that sometimes the singing wouldn't be at the right time. For example at the end when Maria is singing. I'm not sure if I liked the music they picked at times either. I also did not like the fact that some of the scenes were still staged. For example at the dance where Tony and Maria are dancing together. I liked how the actors played all the characters. Natalie Wood did a fine job at playing the roll of Maria. And as the roll of her older brother Bernardo, George Chakiris, did a fantastic job being a gang leader. Russ Tamblyn did a wonderful job playing Riff, the gang leader of the Jets. He made me believe that he had all the fellows under control, even when they got out of control. In addition, Richard Beymer playing as Tony, made me believe he was really in love with Maria. He showed a lot of passion for her in the movie. Rita Moreno did an amazing job playing the roll of Anita. The girlfriend of Bernardo. When she was acting and showing her feelings toward everything that happened, she made me believe that she really felt that way. My overall view of the film is that it was a great musical but some things could be changed. I hope some day they will redo it and change some of the mistakes. I would pay money to go and see it. I would rate this film an 8 out of 10.",West Side Story
278,bgarcia3,Why Maria?,8,26 May 2009,"West Side Story is a very modern twist to the Shakespearean love tragedy of Romeo and Juliet. Only set in the 1960s with gangs in New York City. Basically an American boy, Tony falls in love with a Puerto Rican girl, Maria. Maria has just arrived to America and lives with her traditional Puerto Rican family. Her brother, Bernardo, is the leader of the Puerto Rican gang who named themselves The Sharks. Meanwhile Tony works with Doc in his store but is still friends with rival gang leader Riff. Riff's gang is known as The Jets. Riff knows that Tony will always have his back no matter what. One night Riff invites Tony to a local dance. At the dance they plan to meet The Sharks and decide where they can have the ultimate rumble for the local territory. Meanwhile Maria is also preparing for her first dance, which her brother is taking her to. Both Maria and Tony feel that something great is about to happen at this dance. At the dance Tony and Maria meet. Thus begins the star-crossed lovers' story. They have to see each other in secret because Tony's friends hate Maria's brother, Bernardo and he hates them. Also Maria's parents want her to marry a Puerto Rican man. They don't want her to lose her roots by Americanizing. Tony and Maria pretend to get married and fantasize about both of their families and friends coming together. One night ruins all of their hopes and dreams as the rumble begins and death hits both gangsI really enjoyed the new version of the Romeo and Juliet story. The songs were catchy and I couldn't stop singing them for days. The choreography is amazing! I couldn't remember all of those steps at once. I also couldn't dance in line with the rest of the actors/dancers. That is just incredible. I didn't like how some of the singing and emotions were exaggerated. At times the emotions seemed fake and staged not natural at all. Also when Maria and Tony first meet is a bit unreal. I didn't like the darkened background effect at their meeting. Why didn't Maria die as well? I was thinking that both lovers were to die, so I wanted Maria to die with Tony. Why did she just walk away into the street? I didn't like how all of the people just walked away, including Maria.Maria and Tony were portrayed pretty well. They were very convincing about being in love. They had chemistry on screen. They make a very memorable couple. Plus they could sing so that really made the story more pleasing to watch. Nobody wants to see a musical where the actors can't sing. I didn't like the character of Chino, Maria's suitor. He ruined the whole story for me but of course he had to or else it wouldn't be a tragic love story. Still Chino was very a very flat character you can't even see him as an antagonist. To me he is just a dumb, naïve guy.",West Side Story
279,starcollector73,The greatest musical ever made....,10,8 October 2003,"Im surprised that this movie isn't riding high in the top 250 movies...its an absolute corker of a film with some truely outstanding songs. This takes the old Romeo and Juliet premise and places it in 1950's New York where two angry rival gangs are at each others throats. In the middle of all this hate love blossoms between the sister of The Sharks leader Maria and reluctant Jet member Tony. The musical numbers in this film are breathtaking from the tender 'Tonight' to the incredible 'America' which is a visual treat. Natalie Wood gives a sweet performance as Maria although Richard Beymer's Tony is a little wet (its hard to imagine him in any sort of gang let alone such a fiesty one as The Jets). For me the standout performances are Russ Tamblyn as the energetic, cheeky 'Riff', Rita Moreno as the sultry 'Anita' and especially George Chakiris as the brooding Shark leader 'Bernardo'. This is a classic film that everyone should see, the dance routines are amazing, the romance very moving and you can almost feel the simmering hatred between the two angry gangs. An utter masterpiece. 10/10.",West Side Story

I had to watch this in my music class, and like a lot of the kids, I thought it was gonna be some really stupid movie that I would have to ""watch"". I was delightfully surprised at how cool it was! The songs were catchy, the characters are well done, the romance between Tony and Anita are done very well, and direction from the late Robert Wise made this movie musical a smash hit, and my favorite musical aside from Grease. This is one of the very few movies that I like to watch again and again (the others being Die Hard and Back to the Future). If you happen upon a copy of this movie, I strongly suggest you buy it, because you will get what you pay for. One thing I'd like to mention as well. If you've been paying attention to Steven Spielbergs page, specifically the Director portion, you'll notice that this movie will be remade under his direction.

The acting is first rate and the locations gritty and realistic so you get the feel of what it is like to be a poor immigrant in New York. Natalie Wood and Rita Moreno are outstanding as the beautiful innocent Maria and the alluring more worldly wise Anita. Above all, Bernstein's music is breathtaking and unique, sweeping from gangster slang through lively Hispanic dances to luminous love songs.

Although the sequence of events was changed, and a couple of musical numbers were switched to reflect this, it is still a superb rendition of this Robbins-Laurents-Bernstein-Sondheim masterpiece. Maltin's review, though he does give the film 4 stars, says that the leads (Richard Beymer and Natalie Wood) 'lack charisma'; I disagree. I think they do a fine job of portraying the two young lovers; they are '12 feet off the ground'; terrified; excited; and looking forward to a future that, on some level, they know they don't have. Yet, they strive for it anyway. They act like two young lovers who are confused yet elated, and optimistic against all logic. The music, singing, and dancing could hardly be better. Great a stage play as it is, the canvas of the motion picture screen gave the makers a truly large place to paint this story; and they do an outstanding job.10 out of 10.",West Side Story

I had an argument with my husband about going and left him holding the baby (literally) I was expecting great things from this movie after all that had been written about it but I was disappointed. There were a couple of nice songs but nothing to make me go out and buy the record. The acting I thought seemed forced. I put this in the same category as Dances with Wolves which I also found boring. It seemed like a series of postcard views.

285,Teaterk,West Side BORING,5,25 May 2009,"West Side Story, is considered to be one of the most infamous musicals of all time. The Broadway musical, turned movie is set in Manhattan, featuring the rivalry of two major gangs, the Sharks and the Jets. The story, however, is centered on the blossoming romance between Tony, who belongs to the Jets and Maria who is the sister of the Shark's leader.The two main characters claim to be ""in love"" after only a few days of knowing each other. The height of all the drama occurs when both gangs discover the secret romance and when the Jets challenge the Sharks to a fight.West Side Story is a dull modern version of Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"". However, the accompanying music in this film is absolutely phenomenal. America and Tonight are complete music genius. The first composition and funny light hearted arrangement makes the audience take note of the struggles most immigrants went through moving to America. The second arrangement is a more serious romantic song that truly conveys the feelings of a woman and a man in love. These songs alone make this monotonous movie a somewhat interesting movie.While this Musical was a smash on Broadway, Jerome Robbins (Director and Screen Play Writer of the film) did a horrible job translating this musical from stage to film. Many of the shots in the film, especially the scene where Tony and Maria first meet at the dance, are shot as if the audience was watching it on stage. This scene and many others like it throughout the movie show how Robbins clearly did not know how to translate the musical to the big screen. The film also dragged at certain points and was excessively too long. Towards the end of the film, audience members are left begging for the ending, good bad or indifferent. Also, the film begins with an exerting 10 minute long dance scene. A shortened dance scene or any dialog during this scene would have made for a more stand out entrance to movie.Richard Beymer, did a ho-hum job of portraying his character Tony. Many times he was overly animated and excited; the character's emotions were very forced and didn't seem realistic. Natalie Wood, who played Maria, also did a poor job conveying her characters personality and charm. Her accents seemed overly stressed and unauthentic. In addition to the main characters failing performances, the romance between Maria and Tony was also dreadfully unconvincing. No real person falls in love with in a matter of days. West Side Story is not worth the two and half hours of time it takes to watch this film in its entirety. The film's reworking of ""Romeo and Juliet"" is poor and Arthur Laurents essentially added music to an already written play. All in all I would suggest not watching this film and would only give it 5 stars out 10 for its unoriginality and long drawn out scenes.",West Side Story
286,footballer239,The Tragic Love Affair,8,26 May 2009,"West Side Story is a musical about two groups of murderous street gangs (one white, one Puerto Rican) in New York City. However, in the musical-murder tale, we have the typical Romeo and Juliet spin off. Maria (Natalie Wood) and Tony (Richard Beymer) are the star-crossed lovers in this tale -- she the sister of a Puerto Rican Shark, he a grudging member of the Jets. They don't come from wealthy, feuding families, but from racial groups deeply resentful of one another. The high point of the musical is the big love scene which plays out on a fire escape, outside Maria's room. For a first watch, this movie plays out exactly like Romeo and Juliet; two different parties having conflict with each other and then there are two individuals that fall in love with each other. However, these two love birds come from the conflicting parties. Highlights of the movie were the dances and songs. The acting between the main characters seemed to be realistic. It's a classic love story that will be remade in every which way. I didn't think that the costume choices were that great, the colors were too bold and bright for a movie that took place in New York City. Along with the actual clothing, the girls had dramatic frilly dresses and it seemed like all the girls did was sew dresses they would be wearing later that evening. The length of the movie was a bit lengthy as well. It turned out to be one of those movies you find yourself moving around in your chair to find some comfort. First time seeing this musical, I made perfect distinction as of who was on each side. They made the American gang dress in blue jeans and light colors with a jacket over it. The Puerto Rican side wore more on the darker colors, usually black or dark purple slacks and a dark solid color t-shirt to match with it. The accents from both sides fit well. The conflict between the two teams was perfect, the build up and dramatics weren't too much. I also liked the fact that they over exaggerated the characters, individually, making them seem like they were top dog in their environment.I'm not a musical fanatic, but West Side Story turned out to be a great watch and I think the fact it has parts from Romeo and Juliet will make it easier for audience members to watch and it'll keep them wondering, ""Oh, what's next?"" or "" Let's see if things relate like they did in Romeo and Juliet."" And besides the fact of its lengths, I think many will enjoy it, maybe not so much children. Overall, I would rate this movie an 8 out of 10",West Side Story
287,jrocker13,Musical or Tryout for the Russian Ballet?,2,21 May 2009,"Seriously I couldn't tell if the story being played out was supposed to be taken seriously or not. Although violence is not a big part in musicals, they could've done a bit better to make the fight scenes look real instead of the guys just dancing with each other. As cheesy as the script was, the actors do deserve an A for effort, they were definitely in shape and tried to sing well. It's very easy to pick out everything I don't like about the movie. But to be fair the camera angles, and acting made the movie interesting. I can't remember the camera stopping at any one scene, it was in motion at least 95% of the time. The picture is very good quality for being made in '61. In the beginning the acting wasn't too great, it kind of seemed unorganized, but by the end the actors became a cohesive team. Now for the bashing. I can see where High School Musical got its inspiration from, and it horrifies me. Didn't like the book, never saw the musical on stage, and I never want to see the movie again. Even though the camera was very steady, moving it around so much made me feel as if I was watching a roller-coaster ride. One main thing this movie could have used was more singing lessons. The main reason why I didn't like this movie was because I couldn't identify with any of the characters. None of them were smart or clever enough to be memorable or likable. Most of the movie was about sporadic singing and fight scenes that looked like they belonged in the Russian Ballet. This is not a film I would recommend anyone watching if they want real action.",West Side Story
288,Sprite6308,"""West Side Story:"" 99.9% Perfection",10,21 February 2013,"I could go on and on and on and on about everything that makes West Side Story damn-near perfect, but I don't like to parrot others, so I'll 86 that. Although I appeared in several on-stage, I don't much care for musicals. Most musicals I see as fanciful family entertainment that is harmless, depth less and child-friendly, loaded with the type of music that brings a tear to the eye of the nostalgic and encourages one and all to sing heartily along with those actor/singers on the stage or screen. In my opinion, West Side Story is a miracle. It's referred to as a ""musical,"" but oh, it's so much more. Everyone who's a die-hard fan of West Side Story can agree with that. According to many critics, West Side Story has a significant flaw, and that is the casting of Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer in the two starring roles of Maria and Tony. Critics complain that both those actors were cast as the tragic lovers solely for their celebrity. Well, that's no surprise, it happens more often that not. I don't know what other actors were considered for the role of Maria in the film version besides Natalie Wood, and frankly, folks, I cannot envision any other actor who could bring Maria to life with more honesty and loveliness than Natalie Wood. Granted, Natalie did not sing as Maria, a major ""flaw"" critics loved to point out and scoff at. But then, Audrey Hepburn did not do her own singing in My Fair Lady, either. Audrey, like Natalie, is an outstanding actor with a genius for dialects. Another example is Dorothy Dandridge, the incomparable goddess of stage and screen who ALSO did not do her own singing in her Oscar-nominated performance as Carmen Jones; although she was a jazz/blues singer of the highest repute, her voice was not tailored to sing opera. With actors like these who had it all and then some, no one's gonna notice, or care, that someone else is singing for them! I only know of two actors considered for the role of Tony: Warren Beatty and Elvis Presley. I really can't see Warren Beatty who was King of On screen Gigolos at that time in the role of Tony, an ex-gang-banger from the streets of NYC and decidedly NOT a gigolo. Elvis Presley, on the other hand, would have been a PERFECT Tony, at least in my opinion. His performances in King Creole and Jailhouse Rock proved Elvis to be a fine actor, and he would have had no trouble playing street-wise ex-gang-member Tony. And, needless to say, Elvis would have had no trouble singing Tony's sweeping ballads. Unfortunately, Elvis could never have been cast as Tony because his overwhelming celebrity and drawing power would have diverted all attention from everyone and everything that made West Side Story what it was. On the other hand, I will never understand what possessed central casting or whomever was responsible to cast Richard Beymer as Tony. This sounds mean, I know, but I will not sugar-coat my outrage. Not only did Beymer not do his own singing, but he was as appropriate in the role of Tony as TV-ghoul-of-the-night Elvira would be playing Cinderella. Nonetheless, West Side Story as a whole is brilliant to the point where it's possible to excuse Beymer's miscasting. If you've never seen West Side Story, treat yourself to a priceless film experience! For die-hard fans like myself, West Side Story will continue to rein supreme above all!",West Side Story
289,friendoffilm,"West Side Story--A Classic film that's in a class by itself, and how I came to love it:",10,30 March 2014,"West Side Story is a wonderful, venerable old classic film that's definitely in a class by itself.I was first introduced to West Side Story d through the music to the original Broadway stage production during the summer of 1962, prior to entering the sixth grade, while attending day camp out in the Western part of the United States, in Tucson, AZ One girl in the group I was with, who'd just received a copy of the LP record of the soundtrack for her birthday, brought it to day camp one morning and played it for the rest for our group. My love for the music and the very story to West Side Story took off in an instant.West Side Story-mania was in the air that summer, as kids roamed the hallways in packs, snapping their fingers. The songs to WSS rang through the bus to and from camp every week day. It was so cool!When I got home that summer, I played my parents' copy of the LP album of the Broadway West Side Story soundtrack on my parents' Hi-Fi as often as I could. Much to the chagrin and distress of my parents, who'd given me piano lessons in order to learn how to play classical music, I loved banging around with the songs from West Side Story on our piano.Partly due to my relative social isolation, and partly due to the fact that my parents didn't consider the film version of West Side Story a kid's movie (My sister and I were both young pre-teens when the film version of WSS first came out.), I did not get to see the film version of West Side Story until six and a half years later, as a high school Senior, at around Christmastime of 1968, at a long-since defunct cinema north of both Boston, MA, and the town where my siblings and I grew up. I fell in love with the movie version of West Side Story instantly.As I was still a teenager in high school when I first saw the movie version of West Side Story, I identified with the Jets, the Sharks, and their girls, regarding kids being kids and so on, but when I got a little older and began seeing the film again in many of the now-defunct independent repertory movie theatres in and around Boston, I looked at the film West Side Story not only for the story, the music and the dancing, but for the beautifully created piece of art that it really and truly is.For awhile afterwards, when other movies that I liked played in the movie theaters, I put the film West Side Story on the back burner. Four years after I'd seen the film version of West Side Story for the first time, in the spring of 1972 and the movie came on TV, during an evening Jewelry-making class that I was taking, somebody in the class had brought in a little black-and-white TV, and we all gathered around to watch it.That summer, while on a six-week trip to Europe, somebody in the group I was with had brought along a cassette tape of the sound track to the (original 1961) film version of West Side Story, which was played almost every evening during free hours. My love for this great, golden oldie-but-keeper of an iconic classic movie-musical was re-awakened, along with my desire to see the film version of West Side Story again.Shortly after I came home from Europe that summer, my (late) dad and I had a brief conversation about my wanting to see the movie West Side Story again. It went like this:Me: Gee, I wish the movie West Side Story would come around again.
Dad: You never forgot it, did you?
Me: Nope.That fall, two days before Thanksgiving, the film West Side Story was aired on TV, and I cut my evening Jewelry-making class to stay home and watch it on the little black and white TV that my parents had at home. I have been hooked on this great, golden oldie-but-keeper of an classic movie-musical ever since. I have rarely missed a screening of the film West Side Story when it's played in a movie theatre in my general area (the one exception being in mid-March of 2001, when a Sunday afternoon screening of the film WSS in our area conflicted directly with my late dad's memorial, so I missed that particular screening.) I have even made special road trips to the opposite end of the Bay State, and to neighboring states just to view the film version of West Side Story on a great big, wide movie screen.The storyline, the music, the dancing, the characters, the costumes, scenery, the singing, and the cinematography, all of which I love, have all been combined into the beautifully dynamic little package that it is.West Side Story is a film that I never tire of seeing over and over again, especially on a great big, wide movie screen, in a real movie theatre, with the lights down low! It always feels fresh and new, like I'm seeing it for the very first time, and I always notice at least one or two things in each viewing that I didn't notice in the last.West Side Story is truly a classic that never grows old. While most classic films (even classic films that I've liked well enough to see more than once.) are somewhat dated and frayed around the edges, West Side Story has withstood the test of time fantastically! The MGM quote ""Unlike other classics, West Side Story grows younger."" is so true!",West Side Story

291,franciscofabi,Still Works Despite Itself,8,14 July 2017,"""west Side Story"" perhaps has one of the best scores ever for Broadway show. Every Song is great. The talent behind the camera outshines the leads. Natalie Wood is great in her role as Maria. Richard Beymer is also very good but there is NO CHEMISTRY between the two leads. However the supporting cast is excellent. The dancers outshine the leads however Rita Moreno & George Chakiris deserved the Academy Awards that the received for their work in this film.In case you didn't know this is a modern day telling of Romeo and Juliet. This time the rival families are street gangs in New York.Despite no chemistry between Natalie & Richard the film is still excellent. The last scene with Natalie Wood should have gotten her an Oscar. However since she was dubbed and she had no chemistry with Richard she went home with no statue. In the documentary on the making of the film you can see why Natalie was dubbed. However today with auto tune I think they would have fixed her voice. If you ever get the chance to see this on the big screen take advantage of it.

I think the entertainment industry ought to look back and get a clue.  This had great songs and dances, and sure seeing some tough ""buddy-boy"" gangs doing ballet in the streets may sound funny but it was done with such pizzazz flair that they were able to pull it off.

295,jmhinds,Keep This Story to Yourself!,3,11 June 2009,"Watching the movie ""West Side Story"" for me was cruel and unusual punishment. I kid you not, watching these people dance all over the screen made me want to die. I'm sorry but musicals just are not my thing. Especially one that dates back to the 50's.West Side Story is a story about two rival gangs that want to take over the block. One is a white gang, and one is a Puerto Rican gang. Clearly tempers fly and the go after each other on a daily basis. Finally one day the two leaders of the gangs decide to meet up and organize one major brawl to settle the scores once and for all. Just before the great fight, something unheard of occurs. The right had man from the white gang and the little sister of the leader of the Rican gang fall in love. Something like Romeo and Juliet but instead of rival families, its rival gangs. Could their love be strong enough to withstand the pressure they get from their piers? Me personally I could do without this movie. I really can't enjoy people singing and dancing all over the television for two hours. There were some high points to the movie though. I must admit, the character Maria was very attractive. Watching her made the movie almost worth watching. There was much more bad than good when it came to this movie. The choreography was awful. The moves were not tight and the background dancers were not in sync with each other. I thought the singing was bad also. Vocal coaches were needed to improve the singing big time.Just knowing that this movie was shot back in the 1950's put it in my head to not get my hopes up. The stages were very fake to me. The fact that I grew up watching these modern day films makes it hard for me to take steps backward and enjoy old style films. On top of that I really don't like musicals. I would rather sit through romantic, chick flicks and day. Maybe the next viewer will have more appreciation for this movie but as for me, I rather go without hearing this West Side Story.",West Side Story

298,zimmedc,Still The Best,10,29 December 2004,"As a now 50-year old, I first saw 'West Side Story' when I was about 7. It may have been the first movie I ever saw outside home (actually at a drive-in--remember those?), and it's certainly the most memorable of movies I saw during that time of my life (although 'The Wizard of Oz' and 'The Music Man' are right up there too). In fact, as I watch the DVD now, I'm reminded why when asked, I typically cite it as my favorite movie of all time. The story is hundreds of years old, and now with the onset of drive-by shootings, the threat to the community presented by the Jets and Sharks seems a little dated, but then there's the amazing Bernstein score, and the fabulous Robbins' choreography, heartbreaking songs by Sondheim like ""One Hand, One Heart"" and ""I Have a Love,"" innovative camera work by director Robert Wise, and unforgettable performances by the luminous Natalie Wood and the phenomenal Rita Moreno.I'm not old enough to have seen the original Broadway play, but I saw a recent revival, and the movie even improves on the play by moving a couple of musical numbers around so they fit better with the plot. Great movie musicals are few and far between these days ('Chicago' sold well--I couldn't quite deal with Richard Gere as a song and dance man); I wish there was another 'West Side Story' in store to entertain me for the next 50 years of my life.",West Side Story
299,ethanct86,"A poignant treat for audiences, fans of musicals or not.",10,3 January 2016,"Some classic films have gotten no critical acclaim on their release; others have gotten huge critical success yet have fallen in popularity in recent days. One such is West Side Story. Resulting in one of the profoundest films of all time, West Side Story gathered legends of the present and future from all genres: famed director Robert Wise (Sound of Music) and legendary Broadway choreographer Jerome Robbins** at the helm, prolific composer/conductor Leonard Bernstein with his iconic score, and Stephen Sondheim with the lyrics in his big break. Though it has fallen in popularity and ratings in the past years, Robbin's memorable characters of Tony, Maria, and the teenage gangs of Manhattan merging with notable dance sequences offer a poignant treat for mature audiences, fans of musicals or not.With the united, recurring finger snaps put to Bernstein's blaring and catchy score in a nine-minute prologue, we meet two rival teen gangs, the Puerto Rican Jets and the Caucasian Sharks, and, distinguished by the keen cinematography, their two dear and beloved leaders, Bernardo (George Chakiris) and Riff (Russ Tamblyn), respectively. Furthermore in this scene, we witness a brawl between the fuming gangs rendered in spectacular choreography, setting the plot and subsequently building a foundation for future elements towards the frightful ""Rumble,"" an all-out war between those gangs. Next, the Jets arrive at a Shark's dance to intimidate the Sharks, but they involuntarily strike a spark between two young attendees, Maria (Natalie Wood), sister to Sharks chief Bernard, and Tony (Richard Beymer), best friend of the Jet's Riff, resulting into a ""love at first sight"" against family and racial differences.This film, a possible PG-13 in today's principles, has not much in question regarding negative content but rather in its material on sex and race that borders offensive. A spin-off from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, it deals with the deep racial issues between the Puerto Ricans and covetous Jets, emphasized by strong hostility, various, sharp and inventive racial slurs, suggestive comments and mild swears. Just before the ""A Boy Like That"" number, the two main characters wake up together in bed, implying a sexual interaction, and in a building of tension, Anita, Bernardo's sister (Rita Moreno), is almost raped by the Jets. Also, as mentioned before, darkness hangs over the film throughout, especially during the second half.Effortlessly, Wise, Robbins and Bernstein smoothed the thick line between the light and depressing. Establishing the standard for modern film- musicals, West Side Story won George Chakiris and Rita Moreno Oscars (justly), beginning Moreno's journey to the EGOT***. However, the nominations for lead actor and actress were noticeably missing. Although not diverting, Richard Beymer appears tired and drunk throughout while Natalie Wood's mock accent has been criticized duly as discriminatory. Also, because of Hollywood censors, the creators unfortunately could not include the lover's suicides as depicted in Romeo and Juliet. But taking that out as a legitimate excuse, West Side Story formed strong characters that left me pensive.I like how the creators make you witness both sides of the episode. First you root for the Jets, then the Sharks, then both, agonizing like a lesser character once saying: ""Why do you kids live like there's a war on? When do you kids stop? You make this world lousy!"" West Side Story, hits deep with the significant characters yet doesn't bother much about unimportant ones. The Honorary Oscar-winning choreography isn't just a show-off of the dancer's techniques; in my favorite number, ""Cool,"" an exhilarating release after the death of the Jet's leader that depicts their pain and agony through grunts and shouts, the sharp choreography enhances their emotions. Let's just hope that Robbin's work of genius in West Side Story hopefully may procure its ancient acclaim with a re-release someday.",West Side Story
300,djstuurman,Riveting and easily to relate to.,8,28 November 2015,"Watching the film West Side Story I couldn't help but be reminded that it is somehow loosely based on Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Which means it's what Shakespeare referred to as a romantic tragedy. Instead of having the two families fighting and opposing one another, it's two rival gangs. To me it seems like a more modern take on the famous tragedy. Which is a good idea as in today's world gang violence is rifer than feuds between wealthy families. If we think of and compare two notorious street gangs, it's easier to relate to the story. It's filled with heart-ache, choices, that I would call ""The Eternal Balance'' or more understandably right from wrong, advantages or disadvantages.

I was brought up on this movie, and have treasured it as my favourite musical to ever be conceived.Leonard Bernstein and Stephen Sondheim's lyrics and music are beautiful and MARIA and SOMEWHERE are my stand out numbers in this movie. The dancing by Jerome Robbins is unparalleled, and so modern for its time and this is epitomized in DANCE AT THE GYM and COOL.I am still to see this on the stage yet I doubt it could retain the same colour and vibrance which this film does. All the casting was terrific. Natalie Wood, I believe, gives one of her best performances (second to Splendour in the Grass) and really shows Maria's transformation throughout the story. Another casting choice which I think no one else could play was Richard Beymer. He has the looks, the charisma and the acting chops. It has been criticized that he was lacked the edge of an ex-gang leader yet you have to think of who the character of Tony is. He is like Romeo, he realised that his life in the gang wasn't what he wanted, he wanted to grow up. He is a boy falling in love for the first time and I think this really comes through.Rita Moreno, George Chakiris and Russ Tamblyn also give knock out performances, so do all the Jets and Sharks. However, it is the love which is at the heart of the story which makes people come back for more and more. Every time you watch this movie you still hope that someday Maria and Anton will run away to place of ""peace, quiet and open air"" and every time your heartache's as he dies in her arms.This movie was all deserving of its Academy Awards",West Side Story

305,darling00,Is it imperfect? yes. Is it excellent? Absolutely,10,20 June 2006,"This movie is not for those who don't like musicals; do not expect a gritty true-to-life drama set in the inner city, with dirt, grime, blood and guts. This is a musical.But this is a musical unlike any musical before or since. There is no uplifting moment at the end of the tragedy (e.g. Shirley Jones's ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" at the end of ""Carousel""); this stays dark at the end, true to the ""Romeo and Juliet"" story that inspired it.What's wrong with the movie? 1. Fair to middling acting. The central romance at the core of the story is only lukewarm. I believe in love at first sight(which is different from true love, but that's not what this movie is about, btw), when eyes meet, heart stops, a sudden gasp, knees go weak, and fingers tingle. The central characters in this romance do not do a great job of convincing me that this is happening - Richard Beymer looks lost, Natalie Wood is not Puerto Rican, Russ Tamblyn isn't a gangster. 2. Dubbing - but then again, everyone did it back then- just watch South Pacific, one of the greatest musicals of all time - Lt. Cable, Bloody Mary, Emile deBeque - all were dubbed by real singers; in The King and I, Debora Kerr was dubbed by none other than Marni Nixon, who sang for Natalie Wood in WSS.What's right? 1. The music. From the opening overture, Bernstein's jazzy/Latin americana score is a thrilling, awe-inspiring masterpiece with imaginative tempos, lyrical melodies, and unforgettable songs. 2. The dancing - This is the part of the movie that cinches the deal for me, that make WSS an all-time classic. Jerome Robbins was fired 60% through filming because he ran way over budget pushing his dancing cast to perfection. That hard work shines brilliantly. The Sharks' ""America"" and the Jet's ""Cool"" are among the best ensemble numbers to be found in American movie musicals, imho. George Chakiris is a dancing god, a suave/macho figure (in stark contrast to the wimpy Tony). These dances aren't just ""numbers"", they stand alone as cinematic gems. These two items, the music and the dance, are what make this movie a joy to watch. period. exclamation point. These two items overwhelm the mediocre acting. They give this movie its fire.And for you movie musical fans out there, comparing the latest musicals from Hollywood (e.g. Chicago, Rent, and even Phantom), tell me which of those movies can match WSS in score, number of unforgettable songs, and dance? I don't mean to knock those movies, they do have their gems as well, but a hundred years from now, I guarantee, most of their songs will be forgotten.",West Side Story

But there was not a single song that I can remember; not a single song to write home about.Maybe my expectations are different from most people. Maybe it was because I knew the story already.

The story gives us important message. I heartily learned fighting repeat next fighting, and take love. Secondly all the dances and the song numbers are very nice. The dances are energetic. So character's feelings appear so much by dancing. For example, when character is angry, dance is aggressive. When character is fall in love, dance is beautiful. The dances make the scale of story large. Music also helps storyline. This movie produced a lot of wonderful music.""Tonight"" ""Maria"" ""America""....I often hum to myself.

Specifically, I cannot stomach the swap of ""Cool"" and ""Officer Krupke."" These numbers were placed where they were in the Broadway show for specific reasons. Swapping them takes them out of the context they were originally presented in, and thus changes their impact and meaning in relation to the show. I'm not a fan of the lyric changes, but I understand the reason (motion picture censors). And I'm not a huge fan of making ""America"" into a number with both the girls and boys of the Sharks, but I can live with these issues. Keeping the Robbins choreography was the correct move, and I don't think there's EVER been a better score than Bernstein's. I challenge anyone to find a Broadway score that comes anywhere near the caliber of Bernstein's music. It's not only the best Broadway score ever written, but it has some of the best American music ever written. Also, Sondheim's lyrics (when they weren't changed for the censors) are excellent, with the possible exception of ""I Feel Pretty."" Sondheim himself doesn't believe that it was his best effort, and I have to agree.

I also enjoy films that are set back in older days where the color isn't very bright and almost feels like a black and white film. I think the director did a great job of making this musical into a film. I think some parts still looked as if it was on stage which is understandable. It's interesting how in the middle of a conversation people can just start singing a song. 3.

The Jets and Sharks decide to have a war counsel after the dance at Doc's Candy Shop. Tony comes to see Maria after the dance and sing goodnight to her. The two gangs set a day and time for the rumble that will take place. Within the next couple days, the rumble takes place under the highway. Things don't go as planned and the rumble ends in despair. Tony is running from Chino because he is out to kill him. What happens in the end is for you to find out. 4. I really liked all the music used in this film. There was a lot of hype and suspense at different types when the music would change. I think the characters voices were projected very well in the different scenes. I think the different settings were perfect for the parts that they were played in. The effects also kept you on edge because at times you didn't know what was going to happen next. The scenes in the film matched very well with what was happening at the time. 5. At times I thought there was a little too much singing. I know this was a film based on a musical, but when you make it into a movie the singing should not be so overbearing. I feel the settings did switch a little too fast at times. There was also a quite a bit of dancing for it to be a movie and not a musical. Some of the effects at times were a little confusing and didn't really stand out as much as they should have. 6. I really enjoyed the characters in this film. The actors really portrayed these characters to the fullest extent. Bernardo, Tony, and Maria were my favorite characters. I think they played their parts the best out of the whole film. They really used great expression in their singing and acting. All the actors for the Jets and Sharks did a great job of portraying gangs. Certain audience members would probably be able to relate to certain characters. The characters would most likely be Tony and Maria because of the love they share for one another. 7. In the end, I really enjoyed this film after seeing it for the fourth time. I would watch it once more and like it just as much. Even if you don't enjoy musicals, I would still recommend seeing this film. You might want to see it, especially to find out what happens in the end. I would give this film a rating of 7.",West Side Story
312,Randomly_mental,Fairly good.,7,22 January 2005,"I find it very hard to say I enjoyed this film now. I used to like it, but after a school performance that I was in, I really don't find it as as good. The Maria in my school play was perfect for the part and her voice was so amazing that I can no longer be amazed at Marias' voice and acting the film. However, the portrayal was amazingly good for when it was made. The songs are catchy and it gives people a small bit of an understanding to Romeo and Juliet, as that is what it is based on. the costumes and settings are good and vibrant. I think it is better as a musical being performed live than watching it on video or DVD, but as musicals go, it is still fairly good.",West Side Story
313,rojavida,A tour de force,10,17 October 2004,"Giving this film the title 'musical' is almost demeaning. The score, choreography and emotion displayed are second to none - they have created a genre busting experience. At once exuberant and graceful, dramatic and poignant it is a film I can watch over and over again, despite the valiantly remastered but ultimately disappointing sound on DVD. Even if you don't normally get on with musicals, I urge anyone to try it, this has great dancing and the best music you will find anywhere. Outdated? It was made in the early 1960's so what would you expect? And yet, if you look beneath the surface, you will see the same issues today, poverty breeding conflict, gang warfare, and of course, love. The real star of this film though, is the music. Compared to other musical films, it's in another class!",West Side Story
314,sarah-byrne369,"West Side Story shines with filmic vigour, seldom displayed in cinema since its first performance",10,11 October 2013,"The enchantment and hypnotism of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet is distinctly united with Arthur Laurent's West Side Story in this cinematic rendition that materializes one of the greatest musicals to ever possess our screens. Screenwriter Ernest Lehman and directors Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins devote themselves to Shakespeare's masterpiece and the passion it holds, with solid commitment. West Side Story is an illustration of the relationship between texts, as it is a contemporary reiteration of Shakespeare's tragedy. Tony (Romeo) and Maria (Juliet) have fallen in love, undeterred by their feuding households and the conflicting gangs in which their commitment lies. In a real Romeo and Juliet manner, the star crossed lovers rebel against conventions and risk everything, including death, to be with each another, which opens up, not only the plot, but the heart of the story. West Side Story mirrors topics from Romeo and Juliet as it parallels a prohibited love and a heartrending end, as Ernest Lehman puts his own take on Shakespeare's play to construct a modern, unique romance. To the films praise, West Side Story hasn't abandoned intricate matters. The dialogue delves into the pointlessness of juvenile conflict along with discrimination encountered by foreign nationals, as two cultures come face to face, in the battlefield that is Manhattan. West Side Story delves into conflict among two gangs of juvenile delinquents with contrasting ethnic cultures. The young 'Sharks' from Puerto Rico are continuously tormented by 'The Jets', a Polish-American blue collar labour group. With opaque themes, meaningful melodies, and the spotlight on social dilemmas, a critical revolution in American theatre is born. Vicious encounters are acted in sweeping, cat-like dance, elevating towards a pounding upsurge as Bernardo's sister Maria falls in love with Riff's former accomplice Tony. West Side Story's attitude towards aggression is indeed distinctive. The film is more or less bloodless, with the knifing and gun firing acts unadulterated. Each brawl is extremely formalized and unconnected with realism, as feelings are displayed through dance, throughout the casts' mission of hunting and assaulting one another. Nonetheless, there are genuine perceptions of danger to certain displays, attributable to impressive dance compositions and the discordant attainment Bernstein creates, as the audience not only to see the violence, but feel it. The intensity of visually striking displays where individuals are killed is indisputably reduced, as this method empowers a grittier tale to be conveyed amidst its melodious structure.West side story begins as the camera falls majestically on New York City and meets 'The Jets', an assembly of deprived teens, lurching eagerly about a dilapidated playground. Their figures step delicately and passionately in constant automatic outbreaks of dance. This introduces West Side Story as a musical, displaying a captivating blend of love, misfortune, brutality, music and dance. The introductory finger-clicking arrangement is without a doubt, one of the greatest usages of dance ever known to cinema. In the emergence of the beat, an eager passion races through the juveniles resilient, supple bodies with electrifying dance routines, directed by Jerome Robbins together with the liveliness of the narrative. West Side Story pleasures in parts which are greatly missed from contemporary films, being one of the greatest musicals ever fabricated. Bernstein's film is unarguably impressive, composed of around twelve songs, with love songs such as 'Somewhere' and 'Tonight', instantly known. Leaving aside the pliés and pirouettes, West Side Story centres itself around a star-crossed romance, hidden amidst feuding families along with the effective disposition of clashing street gangs. This au courant showpiece, which parallels with Shakespeare's classic Romeo and Juliet, appears as modern today as it did during the films initial deliverance in 1961. West side story, which starred the beautiful Natalie Wood (Maria) alongside the charming Richard Beymer (Tony) as ill-fated sweethearts on opposing sides of a Manhattan acrimonious dispute, lives on to be one of the most courageous and fervently convincing musicals of all time. West Side Story achieved ten Oscars, including Best Directing for Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins. Aesthetically, the film is a delight. Whilst the attention of the viewer is of course on the music, Daniel L. Fapp and Robert Wise provide the big screen with an exclusive appearance which reminisces on, but does not exactly duplicate Manhattan's West Side throughout the 1950s. Each scene in this film has legitimacy and honesty, obtaining a clever, stylish management of a comprehensive thesis. Ernest Lehman's dialogue is charming, extracted from Arthur Laurent's book, with Wise's directing being authentic and film-wise, creating an efficient blend of austere and desiring characteristics. From the spectacular introductory footage of Manhattan to the endings concluding act, West Side Story shines with filmic vigour, seldom displayed in cinema since its first performance fifty-two years ago.",West Side Story
315,jsweeney94,Film Review: West Side Story,5,14 October 2013,"My film review is on the very popular 1961 musical 'West Side Story' directed by Jerome Robbins and Robert Wise. It is a story about two young characters from rival gangs in New York City who fall in love with one another. It is a modern adaptation of the romantic tragedy, 'Romeo and Juliet'; there are a few differences in the two plots but a lot of similarities.When I first started to watch 'West Side Story' I didn't like it. I thought the beginning was very long and dragged out as the two rival groups danced in the middle of New York. The music and the dancing were very repetitive. It didn't really tell much about the story like other Romeo and Juliet stories would. There was no talking for the first fifteen minutes which I thought dragged it out even more. You didn't learn much about the characters like their names, why they were fighting or even where they were from. However you knew as soon as it begun that it was a musical, as the boys fought in the court yard the music went along with their actions. The first song sang then tells you a bit about the New York gang, how strong they are and how they won't let anyone take their ground.There are a lot of similar scenes in this Musical like there is in 'Romeo and Juliet', however in this story they use modern English and even some Spanish. There is a dance scene which is a lot like Zefirell's 1968 film. The dance scene is very colorful and it is where Tony and Maria meet for the first time, they dance and kiss but unfortunately Maria's brother does not like this and sends her home. Everyone dances in two circles like they did in Zefirell's version. There is also a version of the famous balcony scene in 'West Side Story' but with a modern twist, instead of Maria being on a balcony she is looking down at Tony from the fire escape stairs off her apartment block. I find this really interesting as it modernizes this scene up and since there is so many versions of the balcony scene out there it's just nice to see a bit different.There are very similar symbols in 'West Side Story' than there is in Zefirell's 'Romeo and Juliet'. Circles comes up a lot throughout both movies, at the very beginning of 'West Side Story' there is a bird's eye view of a child drawing circles on the ground in the basketball court where the two gangs first meet, we then see it again in the dance scene when the girls and boys dance in two circles this is exactly Zerfiell's dance scene. Another very common symbol is hands, throughout the musical we see Maria and Tony use their hands a lot to express their feelings. In the ""balcony scene"" they touch each other's hands and say how cold they are. Then when Tony is leaving they reach out their hands to each other as if they don't want to leave each other. The ending of 'West Side Story' is very much like the ending to 'Romeo and Juliet'. Riff gets killed by Bernard accidentally, Bernard is very shocked when it happens and you can see he regrets it as soon as it happens. This is just like when Tybalt kills Mercutio in 'Romeo and Juliet'. Then Tony kills Maria's brother Bernard, just like when Romeo kills Tybalt.I like the characters in this musical, Maria is played by Natalie Wood, Tony is played by Richard Beymar, Riff is played by Russ Tamblyn, Anita is played by Rita Moreno and Bernard is played by George Chakiris. They are good actors and fit the characters really well. I think they are all a good age to play this version of 'Romeo and Juliet'. They aren't as young as the cast Zefirell had for his film. I also quite liked the music in 'West Side Story' the songs were really good and catchy and told the story even better. I like the fact Robbins and Wise made this adaptation into a musical. Since there are so many versions of Romeo and Juliet out its nice to see a completely different way of watching it.In all I liked this film, I thought it was really interesting the way they had the Spanish gang and the NYC gang against each other. The way they changed it into a musical made it even more interesting, it kept me more entertained than the play or the film would.",West Side Story
316,robbiewalsh626,Absolutely loved this film!,10,26 October 2014,"Based on the 1957 Broadway show, the film of West Side Story graced our screens on October 18, 1961. The Broadway show was adapted from Shakespeare's play, Romeo and Juliet. The show and movie used the same theme of two lovers meeting, being from contrasting groups of people. In West Side Story, Tony is a member of the Jets (American), while Maria is a Shark (Puerto Rican). As is the case with Romeo and Juliet, these two characters fall in love and by doing so, cause the deaths of two people who are close to them. Although similar in themes, the movie definitely has its differences – for instance, it is a musical. In terms of acting, an area which I have a bit of experience in, this musical adaption most definitely delivers as there are very strong performances given throughout. One which stood out for me in particular was that of Natalie Wood, who played the role of Maria. For the majority of the film, she played the role which such vulnerability and sweetness, traits which I believe to be extremely suited to a character like Maria. However, in the final scene, her anger and passion is let loose and we see a complete character change. This shows diversity for Natalie as an actor but, it also brings depth and dimension to the character of Maria. On a side note, Russ Tamblyn, who plays Riff, also shone quite brightly. His comic timing and screen-presence lit up every scene that he was in. The musicality in the film was absolutely stunning. The dances were choreographed beautifully. Specifically, I enjoyed the song performance of ""America"" by the Sharks. This is such a nice song that the Puerto Ricans sing about life since they have come to America. The dancing, however, is phenomenal in this scene. One word to describe a lot of the ensemble numbers in this musical would be 'upbeat'. They are all very rhythmic, which provides an interesting contrast to the much slower duets that are sung by Maria and Tony respectively. Having done some research on this film and the actors in the lead roles, I am aware that a lot of the actors did not do their own singing and that their voices were dubbed my professional singers. Although this point annoys me, it definitely does not take away from the performances of these songs in the film, as the actors' expressions definitely bring emotion to the songs. The overall plot was obviously loosely based on Romeo and Juliet but, one key difference was at the end of the film. In the story of Romeo and Juliet, both titular characters die at the end. In West Side Story, it is only Tony who dies. For whatever reason, this adaption chooses to have Tony murdered, rather than taking his own life, which is the case for Romeo. For me, this makes his death even more tragic, as he did want to live on with Maria and spend the rest of his life with her. Does this work though? The answer is simple: yes! This is a clear distinction between West Side Story and Romeo and Juliet – in fact, it is one key element which sets the stories apart. If anything, it allows West Side Story to stand on its own and not rely on the fact that it is another adaption of the famous Shakespearean play. This is a very important point, which I certainly believe to be true. Although an adaption, this film certainly stands on its own two feet and has the credibility to be its own story without the reliance of its predecessor.",West Side Story
317,fieldsal,Great music!,9,27 March 2005,"I still love to watch this film adaptation. The music remains outstanding and it provides a view of a bygone era and society. Some days I wish we could return to a simpler time where knives, not guns are the norm. It seems that today's gangs are both deadlier and grungier. I laugh every time at John Astin and Officer Krupke! The film itself is an older genre that remains popular. It tries to use blends, stills and cut-outs that enhance the audiences understanding of the themes. it remains a classic in cinema musicals. an outstanding use of music, scoring and dialog.

It was like the makeup artists went out in the yard, grabbed some dirt and applied it to all the Hispanics. And with all the wonderful Hispanic actors out here, how hard could it have been to hire a few instead of passing off white and even Asian actors to fill in?! And who hired Opie to be the main Jets gang leader?

320,shelbyrider2,Delight from start to finish,8,24 February 2014,"*spoiler alert* Magnificent, ""I'll never stop saying"" West Side Story is magnificent! Flashback to the year 1961, where the streets of New York City were filled with two rivaling gangs, the recently immigrated Puerto Rican Sharks, and the defending white natives the Jets. Each respective gang with a leader, to whom the entire gang looks to for advice, and would protect until the very end proves the movie's overall theme of loyalty. However, complications arise when outsiders, somehow related to either gang (Maria is the Sharks leader's sister) fall in love with each other at first sight and decide to spend the rest of their lives together. Begging the question, will either gang put aside their differences so these two lovebirds can be together? Based on Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, the movie of West Side Story contains elements that could satisfy anyone. The opening ""Prologue,"" proves, through Jerome Robbins use of aerial shots of the surrounding city contrasting Leonard Bernstein's instrumental, that an intricate action scene is about to take place. The vivid incorporation of ballet, mixed with the sporty style dance fighting is so incredibly detailed, an obvious homage to Gene Kelly's masculine dancing style that became popular after his critically acclaimed Singin' in the Rain debuted. This scene introduces a new genre of gangster fight dancing, which can be argued as an early hip hop dance style, popularized modernly and seen throughout the movie. There is a reason the movie has earned 19 awards and 7 overall nominations. Each scene transitions flawlessly, introducing more action, drama and other popular genres along the way. Elements of the tragic play are emphasized, including the exaggerated love story for the hopeless romantic. John Astin relieves the heavy drama with comedic relief during the dance scene/""Mambo"" number. Even the obsessive musical theater major will enjoy this movie. Overall, an audience interested in multiple stylistic qualities can follow the movie, which is what makes this film an overall classic.The music incorporated furthers the storyline without interrupting key aspects of character development, like in other musical movies, meaning songs don't just appear because this is a musical. The songs are so catchy, you'll be singing them days after you've witnessed the movie. Each song serves a purpose, sometimes surpassing the duologue in the film. In fact, the songs without singing tend to be the movies best, enhancing the dancing visuals, intensifying the storyline. The placement of every song may differ from the musical, for good reason, moving the light-hearted numbers to the beginning act, and saving the darker songs for the second. Some musical theater ""buffs"" would argue against the authenticity of this but by doing so Robbins somehow added more heart to an already emotional piece simultaneously ensuring the film's originality. Each actor possessed the emotionality behind every song in every scene, which is why some earned Academy Awards for their portrayals. However, a majority of the cast was dubbed over by trained singing professionals. Common for film on this era, the idea behind awarding someone for work that wasn't entirely their own seems cheated. The dubbing was fairly obvious in certain scenes as well, making it very distracting (Rita Moreno and Natalie Wood were both dubbed by the same singer at one point in ""Tonight,"" which made the harmony sound like it was being sung in one key). Keeping in mind the generation to which this movie debuted, and how incredible the acting is, the sound discrepancy can be overlooked. The camera style and seamless combination of colors in the set contrasting the climatic scenes during the film should be admired almost as much as the acting. The use of multiple angles throughout the film made it more realistic, and added a perspective that couldn't normally be seen through the musical (because of it's stationary viewpoint on stage). The sets resembled an authentic version of New York in the 1960's. The tall skyscrapers, fire escape behind every apartment and graffiti written buildings helped audiences believe that the film actually took place in New York. Scene's containing both Tony and Maria sometimes showed a blurred background, making it seem like they were the only people and nothing else mattered. Every scene was more breathtaking than the last, making the film one of the greatest musical adaptations even today.Following certain ""ridiculous"" qualities of the original play however proved the film's faults in storyline. The two main characters that fall in love despite their feuding families, don't really know each other that well but are willing to put everything aside to pursue this relationship. This becomes incredibly absurd when Maria finds out that her lover killed her brother, and instead of being upset immediately sleeps with him. From a realist perspective it seems pretty bizarre to forgive someone that quickly for murdering your sibling just because you love him or her. This plot line parallels Shakespeare's equally ridiculous suicide scene that could have easily been avoided if either respected an outsider's opinion over their own, which is again seen in this film during its climatic scene. Tony upset of Maria's death, runs through the streets trying to be killed because he couldn't live without his true love, essentially causing his demise in the process. This was an incredibly frustrating aspect of the film, but needless to say falls under the romantic genre smoothly.Besides the minor flaws, the overall quality of the film garners respect not only to the filmmakers but also to the incredible cast. Even though the movie came out over fifty years ago, it still maintains relevancy, making it a classic must-see. The expression ""they just don't make movies like this anymore,"" directly correlated with this film. No matter how many times viewed the ending scene with Natalie Wood threatening to take her own life will bring any audience member to tears. It's extremely well made, and easily and overall favorite.",West Side Story
321,laurahiggins111,Review,6,14 March 2014,"West side story is undoubtedly the greatest musical picture of its time. Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins adaptation of Bernstein-Robbins 1957 Broadway musical transferred exceptionally well to the big screen. A breakthrough in musical film, West side story explores all sorts of modern issues such as street violence, gang warfare and racism which resulted in the United States Library of Congress labelling it as culturally significant. Wise's development of an originally Broadway musical to a motion picture was surprisingly successful. The broader array of techniques available to filmmakers enhanced aspects such as colour, created the fast paced dramatic atmosphere that captivated the audience. A contemporary urban adaptation of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, located on the mean streets of Manhattan, a long cry from the picturesque streets of Verona. Starring Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer in the lead roles of Tony and Maria, star crossed lovers from rival gangs and featuring enigmatic supporting actors such as Russ Tamblyn, Rita Moreno and George Chakiris the film boasts many outstanding performances. In particular the roles of Puerto Rican gang leader Bernardo and his girlfriend Anita were excellently portrayed by George Chakaris and Rita Moreno, earning them a well-deserved Oscar each for best supporting actor and actress respectively. Their riveting and fierce portrayals of a fiery couple outshone their leading counterparts. Richard Beymer, an unusual choice gave a rather stiff and unconvincing performance as Tony. Wood effectively portrayed the innocent and sweet Maria, as an American actress playing a Puerto Rican character she managed admirably. However, there is an evident lack of on screen chemistry between Wood and Beymer which results in an unbelievable pairing, and an unflattering imitation of the two greatest lovers of all time. Leonard Bernstein's score perfectly accentuates the drama and tension which permeates the picture. Coupled with Jerome Robbins compelling choreography, extravagant and dazzling musical numbers which avoid the constrictions of stage boundaries, the two build momentum resulting in a captivating experience for the viewer. The superb marriage between dance and song brings the film to life and gives a new lease of life to an old well-worn story and is the most attractive feature of the film. The colourful streets and even more colourful characters contribute to this fresh take on Shakespeare's classic tale. The storyline of this adaptation for the most part stays true to the original; Tony and Maria are the forbidden lovers, from rival gangs of different ethnicities. Marias Puerto Rican background adds another dimension to the musical, introducing a new and slightly more contemporary issue to the plot, the racial diversity and prejudice that exists between the Sharks and the Jets. For the most part the two story lines remain quite similar, although the tragic conclusion of West side story deviates from the original, perhaps in an attempt to reduce the tragic element of an otherwise rather upbeat picture.West side story was well received upon its release by critics and public viewers alike, and it is easy to understand the appeal of the vibrant, dramatic and captivating plot and performance, which resulted in it becoming the second highest grossing film of 1961 in America. It was dubbed as ""the best film musical ever made"", by film critic Stanley Kauffmann. The picture won an astounding ten out of 11 Oscars it was nominated for, including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor (George Chakaris), Best Supporting Actress (Rita Moreno), and Best Direction (Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins). Overall, I found West Side Story to be wholly deserving of its widespread acclaim and praise. For its tragic genre, the film manages to remain rather buoyant due to its musical and chorographical excellence. Whilst evidently an adaptation, it does not conform to such limitations and the modern twist and deviations from the original plot allow a fresh take which is appealing to modern day audiences. A mostly epic performance by its cast, I believe West Side Story is worthy of the title 'the best film musical ever made'.",West Side Story
322,ericdcalvo,"Powerful, relevant, yet flawed film.",7,9 August 2015,"Let's start off with the good. Leonard Bernstein's score is absolutely impeccable, nearly unrivaled in the realm of musical theater and film composing for its cohesiveness and beauty. The orchestra packs a punch, but also supplies needed gentleness to tender moments. Each note fits perfectly into the scene, especially when there's a quarrel between the two rival gangs. Nearly every song is an instant classic, from ""Maria"" to ""Tonight"" to ""Cool."" On top of that, the music scenes themselves have remained in the American consciousness for decades. The Sharks' humorous adoration and mockery of the American Dream in ""America"" still resonate deeply today, while the Jets' not-so-nice ode to the oafish Officer Krupke digs deep at what makes a kid ""go bad"" like them. Dance in West Side Story is used to its stylistic peak. The choreography is insanely tight. Watching the Jets and Sharks duke it out with dance on stage is simply a delight and definitely a highlight of the film for me. The dance at the gym is a prime example of just how stellar a scene can be when both the music and the choreography are finely tuned to perfection. I can say with much confidence that those are my two favorite elements of the entire movie. In addition, every shot is filled with gorgeous color. You could analyze its usage till the cows come home and still find more to say. That being said, the film has quite a few flaws that prevent me from haphazardly calling it a masterpiece. Despite what other reviewers say, I find West Side Story's pacing to actually be too fast at times. The whole story takes place over a two day period. Now, within those two days, relations between the Jets and Sharks go from a tense calm to explosive hatred and bitterness. Tony and Maria meet at the dance at 10pm, and by the next evening they're singing about getting married! The two say barely any words to each other, and yet they're dead set on being together for eternity. So much so that when Tony kills Maria brother Bernardo, she isn't even the slightest bit mad at him after a minute or so! Give me a break. And will someone please explain to me why Tony doesn't so much as shed a tear when his best friend Riff dies in front of him? Such a timeless fight scene is nearly ruined by Tony's complete lack of character. Granted, the overall picture is perhaps more important than the little details, but some are just too glaring to ignore! While there are some good performances here (Rita Moreno's is fantastic), there's some pretty poor, ham-fisted acting here and there too, particularly on the Sharks side. This is mainly due to the fact that almost none of them are actually Puerto Rican or even Latino. Most of the Sharks are so bad at their accents that they sound Italian, Maria and Bernardo included. The actual Spanish they utter amongst themselves is at times laughably bad. The dialogue between most characters is pretty good at its best, but unbearably cheesy at its worst. All in all, West Side Story is a film that everyone should watch for its incredibly important message. Its subject matter was daring for its time, and some of the characters lines are still a bit edgy (Life is alright in America / If you're all white in America). Despite its lackluster Latino representation, the film raises some daring questions about race and represents the Puerto Rican-American community with respect and truth. When I put some of its glaring flaws aside (and completely block out Natalie Wood's horrendous accent), I can still enjoy West Side Story quite a lot, and even get teary-eyed at its powerful conclusion.",West Side Story
323,matthikopp,My all time favourite,10,10 September 2014,"I have seen this movie more than 50 times, I own several recordings, my friends even gave me a cinema screening of this Masterpiece for my 30th birthday.Everything, really everything is perfect. The casting couldn't have been better, the music is played virtuosly and flawless. Some changes to the original script make the story even more fitting. Nothing ever came so close to the Original Romea and Juliett story. So i keep on and keep on watching this, my entire life, thats for sure.What I really don't understand how this movie is not in the all time 250 and get's far worse ratings than todays Marvel Comic Blockbuster Movies. Partly because there are people here giving it 1 Star arguing they just don't like musicals in general. Partly because people don't seem to appreciate quality movie making as they used to do.So don't believe the rating, this movie did win 10 Oscars for a reason and is one of the finest you will ever see, i promise!",West Side Story
324,amycomerford,The drama is nothing compared to its dancing,7,24 October 2014,"William Shakespeare's infamous 'Romeo and Juliet,' is revitalised by director Robert Wise as he takes it from the stage to the silver screen in the, if not equally infamous, 'West Side Story'. As a film that has had much acclaim I was already familiar with its storyline and some musical numbers, although having never seen it. I had high hopes. I love a good musical. 'West Side Story' received an outstanding eleven Academy Award nominations. It would go on to receive ten of these including Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor and Actress for George Chakaris and Rita Moreno respectively, and Best Direction for the dynamic duo of Robert Wise and principle choreographer Jerome Robbins. I was expecting perfection. Perhaps it was for this reason that I was unfortunately left feeling deflated and ultimately disappointed.That being said, I do not want to let my disillusionment cloud my objectivity. The film was not all bad – there were pleasant aspects. The choreography by Robbins is sheer genius. I do not envy the gruelling efforts the cast and crew made to create this excellence. The stories of Robbins need to create perfection in every take are well known. His inability to say 'Cut!' did ultimately lead to his removal from production due to financial impracticality but his assistants proved loyal to his vision and every step we see is his. Robbins displays innovativeness far out ranking any of his contemporaries. The notable scene whereby the gangs run toward a tall chain-link fence and manoeuvres themselves barehanded upwards and over onto the playground below in one fluid motion is not only incredible to behold in the moment, but you cannot help but wonder how many times the poor actors, not stuntmen, were forced to carry out this sequence to give it it's effortlessness.I also found the retelling of 'Romeo and Juliet' itself to be utterly refreshing. I enjoyed the setting's transference from 16th Century Italy to the more familiar Upper West Side New York. The Montagues and Capulets become two rival street gangs - the second generation European immigrant Jets and the Puerto Rican Sharks struggling to find their place in the world. While I find fault with the actual names of the gangs and dub them corny, the perpetuation of the young adults as victims of racial barriers evokes empathy in the viewer and an understanding of the feud not present in Shakespeare's play due to purposeful ambiguity. The removal of the parents from the plot and the casting of a young Rita Moreno as Anita to mirror the role of the older Nurse serve to make the film more appealing for a younger audience. These simple plot devices come together to make William Shakespeare approachable and take away the impossibility of coming to terms with his extensive literary catalogue.Be all that as it may, I cannot hide my belief that this film was anti-climactic. I found the dialogue uninspired and bland. It was corny, and not in a tongue-in-cheek kind of way. As a Disney lover, I am a big fan of cheesy fairy tale romance. That being said, I cannot hide my disdain for the interchanges between the two leads Maria (Natalie Wood) and Tony (Richard Beymer). Firstly, there is a sheer lack of chemistry between the two lovers. Beymer is cripplingly insincere due to his incapability to carry the role of leading man let alone portray the role of a reformed gang leader. I am unable to find them to be a credible couple. I do not root for them. In terms of casting, on the other hand Rita Moreno's portrayal of Anita saves the show. She is utterly deserving of her Oscar. She exudes a charisma, magnetism and passion in that role that puts on display the numerous flaws of Beymer and Wood for all to see.While I can admire the bold move to rewrite Shakespeare's tragic ending of mutual suicide, I cannot help but wonder if perhaps to have had Maria shoot herself would have saved my view of the film. While this film does indulge on tragedy through violence, murder and an attempted rape, I cannot help but say I was unmoved. The film lacked the same powerful ending that 'Romeo and Juliet' has. The death of Juliet in the play is critical to the play's success. It embodies the play's message of love and intensifies its moral - intolerance creates only sorrow. I understand that it played into the character development of Maria in becoming a confident and independent woman, but I do think her death could have given the movie the strong conclusion it so desperately needs. The hint of reconciliation between the Jets and the Sharks is utterly contrived and does not do anything to add a satisfactory climax. If anything, it only serves to underline American cinema's need at the time to provide feel good cinema and a happy ending.Overall, the film's drama is nothing compared to its dancing. The leads are overshadowed by Rita Moreno. The gangs are parodies. The ending is lacklustre. It is for these reasons I would give it only three-and-a-half out of five stars. For a film with such potential and such acclaim, I truly had expected more.",West Side Story

The tough exteriors, captured the lives so clearly of the passion within that time period.

The music, the dancing, the surrender of talent came flooding out with so much power, you had to fall in love, right there and then with the cast.

A more perfect movie doesn't exist. The combination of drama amazing music and heart pounding choreography makes this a movie going experience not to be missed. Natalie Wood was incredible and the voice matching of all the singers was impeccable. This is a movie that should be re-released on the big screen so new generations of movie goers can experience the movie the way that it was meant to be. It is one of the greatest American movies ever made and the best music ever written for a musical. There was one minor flaw that I never noticed before. The Jet member that had green paint poured on him from the sharks during the opening fight sequence cleaned up really quickly for the next scene where he and his clothes were clean as can be.,West Side Story

The actors voices also feels very modern, especially Russ Tamblyns. The love story is cute but never embarrassing. Though the most fascinating thing about ""The West Side Story"" is the smashing choreography. Everything, from dying to putting a fake gun back becomes a dance move, in a natural way. I'm not that much for dance really, but this is really good! The Movie gets kinda slow in the end, a bit TOO much dancing maybe? Some characters are a bit dull too, but overall, it's a great musical, if not even the greatest.",West Side Story

I've seen the movie 4 times and I never get tired of watching it. I would recommend this movie to a lot of classic-movie lovers and also to people how are in interracial relationships. The actors and actresses in the movie were wonderful. I'm a dancer, so watching the choreography and listening to the songs were so much fun. I actually downloaded a lot of the music on my computer.

There is no way to describe the way that you feel when you see Maria's ""only love sprung from (her) only hate"" (Romeo and Juliet) and the pure hatred that surrounds her. The music, the dancing, the motions, the moods - all are portrayed in such a spectacular way in the movie... It makes me cry every time I see it, even though it has been my supreme obsession for over 3 years now... This spectacular movie has a special place in my heart, and will forever. The heartbreaking richness swallows me whole, and I am sure that after seeing even as many times as i have already, that it will never let me go, and keep me warm and happy....

Yes, the leads, (and especially Richard Beymer)are a little too reserved to my taste, but this is a movie driven by the story and its songs. One complaint--and this has nothing to do with the film--is the sound quality of the DVD. Though mastered in dobly digital 5:1, there is virtually no surround sound. The DVD is best appreciated by setting your home theater receiver to the two channel stereo mode. Otherwise, most of the sound is processed through the center channel, which is a shame.

This picture evokes so many emotions, where does one start in describing it.  I think Bill Shakespeare himself would have been proud of this Romeo & Juliet adaptation.  Jets & Sharks, Montagues and Capulets, Tony & Maria, Romeo & Juliet, the cross references are masterfully executed. The combination of the music and lyrics seems to have been made for each other.I never tire of this movie even after seeing it 60 or 70 times.  There are many messages which unfortunately still apply today.  Troubled youth, dysfunctional family life, racism, xenophobia to name a few.I wish there were outtakes of this move as it must've been lots of fun for the cast members in making it.Check out Natalie Wood in the scene where Tony comes to her after the rumble.  Wow !  What a scene.Another GREAT scene is when all parties are singing ""Tonight"" prior to the rumble.  The music , lyrics and timing is just incredible.What a great movie..I LOVE IT  !!!!!!!",West Side Story

Robbins' choreography is, of course, brilliant, and Russ Tamblyn is fantastic as Riff.  Musical numbers like ""Jet Song"", ""Officer Krupke"" and ""America"" are wonderfully presented here.  My one complaint is a big one, though.  IMHO, when filming one of the all-time greatest musicals, one would hope to assemble a cast of actual musicians.  Neither of the 2 leads, Tony and Maria, actually sing, and that makes it hard for me to fully enjoy numbers like ""Somewhere"" and ""One Hand One Heart"".

We all ""sensed"" we were part of a history making movie with two respected leaders (Robert Wise & Jerome Robbins).True, it ran over production costs only because these two perfectionist would not accept mediocrity. In 2001 I attended the 40th. anniversary of West Side Story at Radio City Music Hall. It was an nostalgic evening meeting with the cast and Mr. Wise again after so long a period. A little trivia concerning the film. Portraying the 3rd. policeman in the movie I was driving my own car. I was told it would be painted with water color to resemble a N.Y.P.D auto and afterward it would wash off. Unfortunately, it did not wash off and they had to repaint the car black again. As happens in many a movie I ended up on the cutting room floor and many of my scenes never made it in the finished film.

Well, Richard had/has a fantastic singing voice; which he proved in a couple of Dr. Kildare episodes and in his 2nd movie ""Joy In The Morning"". He even had a couple of great-selling LPs. I don't think they would of had to dubbed his vocals by anyone else. Also, this is the first I heard that Elvis was once considered for the part of Tony. Wow, that would of been something. I think Elvis would of pulled it off fantastically.(And of course, no dubbing would of been necessary!)

339,lizalirova,A review - School work,10,15 May 2006,"""The West Side Story"" is an American musical, screen-version produced in 1961 by 'Metro Goldwyn Meier', remains an outstanding example of movie musical even now. The movie's success can be explained by the spectacular cooperation of the masters, the creators of the 20th century musical  Leonard Bernstein (music), Arthur Laurents (book), Stephen Sondheim (lyrics), Jerome Robbins (production, choreography, direction) and self-sacrificing, inspiriting and ideal work of the actors, which managed to create unforgettable characters: Natalie Woods (who played Maria) and Richard Beymer (who played Tony). ""The West Side Story's"" plot, in many ways, resembles the immortal comedy by William Shakespeare  ""Romeo and Juliet"", with the exception that all the action is moved to the middle of the 20th century. The Montagues and Capulets become two street-gangs of New York: the pure-'American' Jets and the Puerto Rican Sharks, who fight for a small section in the west side of the 'Big Apple'. The modern Romeo and Juliet become Tony and Maria, and now not only the disputes between the families and blood-vengeance stand on the way of their happiness, but racial and ethnic barriers as well. Tony not only belongs to the Jets, he is a founder of them as well, while Maria's father and brother are the founders and leaders of the Sharks. The two lovers stand in front of a very hard choice  either to betray their friends and family, or sacrifice their love. I will not reveal the rest of the plot, but if you a familiar with Shakespeare's 'Rome and Juliet' you can probably guess how the story will end.Simple, well-known story line is extensively compensated by brilliant, easily-remembered songs. There are several of these which should defiantly be not mentioned: 'Maria' (preformed by Tony; a beautiful solo, which narrates about the love from first sight), 'Tonight' (preformed by Tony and Maria, which became the theme of the whole musical) and 'America' (which is performed by the Shark Girls; has very catchy lyrics and Latin American tunes). Another contribution are the musical numbers  they all have very interesting stage direction and 'inter-cooperation' of the songs, choreography and setting. To illustrate this, the following example can be used: 'Mambo and Cha-Cha' (this musical number is a fusion of 'American' and Puerto Rican melodies. The music is performed by the Orchestra, which manages to quickly 'get the mood' of the melodies which are apart from each other by beat and tempo. The dances are performed by the Jets and the Sharks  this 'dance and musical contest' is a form of a 'duel' between the two rivaling gangs) and Gee, Officer Krupke (this song is performed by the Jets and it is a parody on the way Officer Krupke walks, talks, acts, types of orders and tasks he gives. The Jets, which got annoyed by his behavior, decide to make fun of the Officer and perform this light, comic song.) One other thing, which contributed to the uniqueness of this musical is the fact that most of the songs were performed by the actors themselves (one exception was some of Natalie Wood's vocals, which were dubbed by famous Marni Nixon  her other works include duplication of Audrey Hepbern's vocals in ""My Fair Lady"" and Deborak Kerr in ""The King and I""; the other exception were Richard Beymer's and Rita Moreno's vocals in the 'A Boy Like That'/'I Have A Love' duet  they were dubbed by Jimmy Bryant and Betty Wand).This musical is wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone  if you have not yet watched it, then it is a great omission. I think that the best thing in ""The West Side Story"" is the music: an absolute balance, the bewitching 'courage' of it. All the slightly 'husky' atonality are matched up with a sweet melody; which change every second and grip you, not letting you 'move away from the screen'. The last time I watched ""The West side Story"", I played it very loud, and could say that I almost felt as if I was in Manhattan. After seeing the film, I went back to some of the songs, and for the rest of the day was either singing the tunes, either tapping them on the tables. ""The West Side Story"" won 10 Academy Awards  including the Best Picture and the Best Director/s. A true classic musical of all time and a definite 'must-see'.",West Side Story
340,a-30336-31809,West Side Story: A New Love Tragedy,2,4 June 2020,"Picture a fancy tea party. The fine China is very, thoroughly, clean and set in the most elegant manner. The delicacies look divine, perfect, soft, moist, and fluffy. The room is very neat and tidy. The open windows send the curtains flying around from the soft breeze. The soft classical music plays with sounds of a beach in the distance. You sit down and grab a cake and as you bite into it, you find a clump of dog hair in each bite. The entire tea party is now ruined. In the West Side Story, the prejudice represents clumps of dog hair in my film cake.
The acting in the West Side Story is on point. They all go from verbal fighting to dance fighting with no mistakes. The actors and actresses know their lines and say them at the exact time needed. Even though the music is fast the pacing is very normal rate for every other love story. The music is really loud and is a big part of this play. It is iconic, and it is one of the most important parts of the movie. It would be like someone dancing without music. You wouldn't know what to think or to know about the character. The music gives us more context and puts more emphasis on emotions and tone.
There are a lot of dynamic characters which give the story more clarity. Maria is so helpless and wanting love, that she over exaggerates and is over dramatic sometimes. She's grown up hating the preppies just like her brothers and sisters. Once she falls in love with Tony, she thinks differently of that group, and wants everyone else to see her point of view. Tony also wants the same thing. They are trying to convince their relatives and people in the gang that the other group isn't so bad without them knowing that they are seeing each other.
See, the tea party is good, but then we come to the clumps of dog fur. Discrimination should not be in movies or plays. I get it that it was made at a time when discrimination was a big thing, but its not really right to put into a film. Even though this is a classic love story, and what is a classic love story without violence and prejudice which is what we have here. There are other ways to have the antagonist be known for something other than prejudice. One good thing about prejudice in films is when there is a happy ending to balance it out. In this case there is too much prejudice. Even if it was happily ever after, it still doesn't feel right. In this case, there is so much discrimination involded that people can't stop hating.
Some might think that the ending is similar to Romeo and Juliet. I'm not disagreeing with that at all. This is what makes this a tragedy. The movie is pretty darn good, but it has one teeny, tiny clump of dog hair in each bite.",West Side Story
341,guillermoegarzon,One of the bests,10,5 February 2008,I was very young when I saw by the first time this beautiful musical. I became in love at first sight of Natalie Wood and of course of her character Maria. People don't like too much the musicals. It is a common opinion that they are not realistic. But when the eyes of Maria asked for the guilty between both gangs I think it was not possible to maintain this opinion. Despite the fact it was a Broadway musical the translation to a filmic language was wonderful. The wonderful choreography of Robert Wise was the starting point of a new style and brings to the film this magic movements that were reproduced in a fantastic way by the panavision lens. Also the incredible music of Leonard Bernstein was increased by the stereo soundtrack and is today after more than 40 years one of the best CD soundtrack albums.,West Side Story

He was a great composer, equally comfortable writing classical, semi-classical, and popular music.

And, of course Latinos dreading the return to Puerto Rico, appearing as if the United States was a whole lot better. But, of course this movie was to encourage a type of assimilation for the immigrant. Take the name Sharks v.

He should have been nominated for an Oscar. And I was very sad to read his career stopped here. In pictures from his later years, he looks like an awesome guy. I wish I could have seen him in more movies. I feel robbed! The 'delinquent' song is excellent and so funny. I thought Avenue Q was modern and cutting edge. West Side Story did it years ago. This song goes into all the causes of juvenile delinquency in a humorous way that seems so far ahead of its time.And the dancing in the social dance scene is amazing. How 'out there'. Again, much more cutting edge than expected.The problem I have with the film is that it all occurs in two nights (perhaps I should blame Shakespeare?) and that Maria could go for a guy she had just met that killed her brother (perhaps it would have made more sense to make Bernardo her over-protective cousin). I found that so hard to swallow it kind of spoiled the whole thing. Although I thought Natalie Wood did well in the last scene. And, of course, Oscar-winner Rita Moreno was amazing.I have two thumbs, so I give it two thumbs up.",West Side Story

I think overall its a racist film made during a time of high civil tensions. To attribute William Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet to this film is a disgrace to Mr. Shakespeare. I believe in 1961 this film would have made more sense as a concept, today however it's very dated. I really feel this movie would/should be considered a Kids movie. The movie and songs are very innocent and this a beautiful thing. Lets just say West Side Story ""Jumped the Shark' a bit! Its sad that this piece of film is considered one of the great musicals... I prefer Mary Poppins or The Wizard of Oz any day. I just wish William Shakespeare's Masterpiece wasn't mentioned with this film.... as Hamlet says: O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I! Is it not monstrous that this player here, But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, Could force his soul so to his own conceit That from her working all the visage wann'd, Tears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect, A broken voice, an' his whole function suiting With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing, For Hecuba! What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weep for her? What would he do Had he the motive and the cue for passion That I have?

351,movienthusiast,Musical Weakness,8,23 February 2004,"No doubt,it is a very good film. But I would like to point out a weakness that has caught my eye. The film is usually called the landmark musical of the last century and so on. It had around 10 to 12 songs.  I have seen the movie only once some 4  years back. As far as I can remember,there were 2 songs that were used in very weak moments of the script.Especially, /*** warning spoilers ahead***/after the murder of Bernardo when Anita were trying hard to make Maria understand that Tony actually did not love her and would eventually leave her(Maria); the director here chose to put this conversation through a duet song sung by Maria and Anita.If anybody has some cinematic sense and has watched the movie, he will realize that in this situation, a dialogue would have done much better than a song. I,personally,like musicals very much. I heard (before viewing 'West side story') that this movie earned ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director.It clearly indicates that this is a film of extraordinary merit. But then, I was very much pained to see the use of some songs in some situations, which demanded them the least.Well,I liked the particular song where the girls and boys of the 'shark' team (i.e., the Puerto-Rican immigrants) are debating about the lifestyle of America pitted against that of their homeland. It was a thoroughly enjoyable song.",West Side Story

As such it is on a higher plane than most movies ever made. The music is from Leonard Bernstein, maybe the best American composer ever.

Natalie wood has stared in both gypsy and west side story, as maria and gypsy rose lee. Even though she is fantastic, her Oscar nom was removed because she was dubbed, by the same person who dubbed my fair lady. This movie is one of the few plays that wasn't drastically changed to fit its movie, which coincides with its length of nearly three hours. not to mention that it won ten Oscars, which has only been surpassed by ben hur and titanic. West side story picked up an Oscar for the sensational Rita Moreno, Anita, who was also the first actress to win an Oscar, tony, grammy, and an emmy. As if this wasn't enough this movie has taken the classic tale of Romeo and Juliet and adapted it to model our own time. Alone this universal theme could have been placed any place at any time, but mixed with a genius score and dazzling choreography this is one movie that is worthy of new york.",West Side Story
356,elanlub,Beautiful film,8,3 April 2005,"I love the classic Romeo & Juliet story, and I love seeing well-done modern adaptations of it. So, when I first saw West Side Story, I was blown away by Bernstein's amazing music, and Sontheim's lovely lyrics. A great story of star- crossed lovers, their was only one part I was unsatisfied with: The ending. WARNING: SPOILERS: I was so angry with the way, they changed the original text! How could they kill Tony but not Maria! It destroyed it for me. Besides that however, it's a lovely movie. The direction was awesome, the writing cute, and the acting smart. I have always been a fan of Berstein as well as Sontheim, so seeing their work together is just marvelous. All in all, a great adaptation of Shakespeare's amazing story.",West Side Story
357,pandora-46,West Side Story vs Romeo and Juliet,10,30 December 2004,"The movie West Side Story, starring Natalie Wood and Richard Beymer about 'star-crossed lovers' from two different worlds, is a truthful and yet musical portrayal of life in New York. The story itself, is a dedicated and truthfully updated version of Shakespeare's play, Romeo and Juliet. The plot refrains from diverting the viewers mind from the original plot of Romeo and Juliet, staying within the bounds of the play's events and main ideas. The movie, grasping the audience with a combination of genres such as music, drama and romance, has managed to create an ideal understanding of Shakespeare's most famous work for the younger generation. The rival gangs, the Sharks and the Jets, show the troublesome relationship between the two families, the Montagues and the Capulets. The events and differences between the opposing two, guide (Romeo and Juliet)Maria and Tony towards their fated end. As Shakespeare wrote, 'my only love sprung from my only hate', showing that the stronger the conscious hate, the stronger the unconscious love. The final end of the movie, perfectly portrayed what might have happened to the Montagues and the Capulets, if either one of Romeo and Juliet had lived. Their hate would have been distinguished and there would be a realisation of what their actions and judgemental thoughts have done to those surrounding them. Though, this was achieved in the play, by both character's deaths. The very fact that Maria did not die and lived to show the world how its hatred and deception tore her from her lover, just goes to show how magnificent this film really is. Although not dedicating it's entire plot to the truth that was Romeo and Juliet, it has managed to captivate audiences worldwide with it's clever and colourful look at humanity. All in all, no matter the similarities or differences between the film, West Side Story, and the play, Romeo and Juliet, the fact remains that both are exquisite and as intriguing as the other. There really is no competition between the two. As a matter of fact, there is no need to compete the two against each other as they both stand out on their own merits. Truly captivating and original.",West Side Story

360,areuter1,Historical Context of West Side Story,8,5 May 2005,"Considered a classic on stage and on screen, West Side Story is the musical tale of two lovers Maria (Natalie Wood) and Tony (Richard Beymer), each of different race, who must fight prejudice, stereotypes, and poverty on the streets of west side Manhattan. Set in the late 1950s, directors Jerome Robbins (who also choreographed) and Robert Wise depict the tensions between the Jets, second generation white European immigrants, and the Sharks, newly arrived Puerto Rican immigrants, who are fighting for a piece of the street in the midst of this love story. It is during a dance that Maria and Tony meet and fall in love, but they are torn apart by her brother and leader of the Sharks Bernardo (George Chakiris). Using this as an excuse, the Jets' leader Riff, played by Russ Tamblyn, challenges Bernardo to an all out, once-and-for-all fight to decide who will rule the streets.The movie highlights the suspicions and racial tensions occurring between different ethnic groups in 1940s and 1950s America. During this time, many Hispanic immigrants were coming to the country, both legally and illegally. The largest group during this time, however, were the Puerto Ricans, who were actually American citizens. Most immigrants moved to New York City, which still contains the largest Puerto Rican community in the world. Puerto Rico was originally a Spanish colony but was lost to the United States during the Spanish-American War in 1898. Later, in 1917, the US Congress gave Puerto Ricans American citizenship, creating no barriers for immigration. But they were now also eligible for the draft during World War I. 1917 also paved the way for new immigration laws, which stated that people must be able to read and write at least one language. During the years of the Depression, Puerto Rico was hit especially hard because it had grown dependent on one crop, namely sugar. The collapse of its price value produced widespread economic and hunger problems. Many influential leaders then advocated for the separation of Puerto Rico from American control. The years between 1940 and 1960 saw the largest increases of Puerto Rican movement, as many as 545,000 came in search of jobs and new opportunities that America was known for having.Both Robbins and Wise worked hard through the script, choreography, lyrics, and stage presence to establish the tension between the white Americans and the Puerto Ricans. European immigrants who had been living in the US for a while often saw the intruding Latinos as taking over the neighborhood, taking good jobs away from the Europeans who had been there first. They spoke Spanish and maintained their own culture, which the whites saw as anti-assimilation and as ""weird."" This is shown in Officer Krumpke's (William Bramley) comments on how the ""PR's"" (Puerto Ricans) are corrupting the neighborhood and dirtying the streets and in Bernardo's taunts that he needs a translator to understand their words. The use of ethnic slurs, such as ""Pollack or Spic,"" also adds to this tension.Many immigrants who moved to the United States came with dreams of a new life, filled with opportunity and riches. However, their hopes were often smashed as they met a hostile environment of prejudice and hard times, finding poverty here, as well as, in their home land. The juxtaposition of their idealistic dreams and the harsh reality of the situation is found in the musical number ""America,"" sung mainly by Anita (Rita Moreno) and Bernardo. Parts of the movie were filmed on location in west Manhattan in a condemned part of town that was going to be torn down and rebuilt, recreating a poverty stricken neighborhood where many Hispanic immigrants were forced to live.While the directors successfully showed the tensions between the Jets and the Sharks, they neglect to portray that the Puerto Ricans were actually American citizens. While Officer Krumpke does vaguely acknowledge this right, it would be more clear if there was better emphasis on this event. Another suggestion that may help the audience understand the historical context would be to add more Puerto Ricans in the background or surrounding areas as to signify that this was a time of great Puerto Rican immigration, causing the tensions of the time.Watching West Side Story is as enchanting on screen as on stage, affording the audience a closer and sometimes more in depth view of this world that the stage cannot offer. The songs and music make one want to dance and sing with the characters, as many have heard these classic songs before. Once again, Jerome Robbins has created amazing choreography that encapsulates the violence and stress of hard times in New York City, especially during the stylized fight scenes. The plot is a take-off of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, so the audience is mostly aware of storyline. Most people, as well, enjoy rooting for the ""star-crossed lovers"" who must fight against social issues and familiar objections, reveling in their late night rendezvous and romantic interludes. While probably cutting edge at the time it was made in 1961, the cinematography is outdated for today's audiences. However, the picture is a fun and entertaining way to spend an afternoon while learning about the racial prejudices of the time.Overall, West Side Story portrays the racial difficulties and social problems plaguing immigrant groups in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s, especially among Hispanic and European groups. Yet, it proves that these problems can be overcome through the romance of Maria and Tony, and their ability to see past racial lines. The music is captivating and catchy, and one quickly understands why this story on stage and on film has become a classic American musical. This movie is worthy of 8 ½ stars for its romantic storyline, wonderful music, and its portrayal of immigrant life in the US. West Side Story shows that while a new life can be difficult, it can also come with amazing opportunities.",West Side Story

362,coolgirl1524,A timeless masterpiece,10,9 August 2005,"West Side Story is really a timeless homogeneous masterpiece for many reasons. Everything fits very well together. I have seen it dozens of times and I can watch it again and again, every time I realize something new and although it is quite long, it is never boring and can't be shorter. Neither the story (love, hate + aggression) is outdated nor the music which will still be listened to in decades. The actors which seemed to be carefully chosen, also because of their acting, singing and especially dancing abilities (esp. George Chakiris, Tucker Smith and Tony Mordente). The scene and the place with a certain atmosphere, strengthened by the kind of illumination. It fascinates right away. The opening with the view of New York, Manhattan, the West Side until we see the gangs' turf and finally the Jets who snap their fingers, all this leads you into that certain direction. Every time I watch it, I have the same goose skin as I had the first time, more than 30 years ago!",West Side Story
363,jjbutvich,The best musical ever,10,9 July 2005,"Just the best musical ever. It certainly deserves to be rated as one of the best movies ever made. Winner of ten Academy Awards. Best Picture.

A movie that deserves to be seen on the big screen the way it was intended, with full sound and the intermission. A joy of life to be watched over and over again. A movie to be passed on to your children and their children. This motion picture is art in every sense. A true celebration of the senses, from the opening helicopter shot to the graffiti walled end. Art everywhere. Musical Art, Dance Art, acting art, directing art. A student of film could earn a degree by just watching this motion picture and learning that film is about giving a good performance. And what better example than West Side Story. This movie gives great examples in the ensemble performances from the actors to the loving hand of Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins.",West Side Story
364,kayala-83441,A Classic Tale of the Present,9,10 April 2016,"Whether or not we've seen it, we all know about Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins' film adaptation of West Side Story (1961). A classic retelling of Romeo and Juliet in the cinematic version of Arthur Laurents' musical, this film's tunes, story, and romantic tragedy have echoed in our American culture for over fifty years through the infamous feud between the Caucasian Jets and Puerto Rican Sharks—aka the Montagues and the Capulets. West Side Story is a charming trinket whose relevance we like to think belongs to the past, but what if the film isn't just a portrayal of the past? What if traces of it still exist in the reality of today's America? Latinization in America, primarily the Big Apple, has been happening for more than a century. The results stand loud and proud through the bodegas on every corner, Spanish-speaking establishments, and the spread of vendors selling pastelillos. In 2016, there doesn't seem to be any indication of Puerto Ricans hiding away with their own kind. But this isn't the case in the New York of West Side Story, where mid-century immigrants have to fight a turf war just for the right to exist on the streets, and the star-crossed lovers, Maria (Natalie Wood) and Tony (Richard Beymer), stand no chance as their respective sides tug at them, forcing them to choose allegiances. Although today's New York is an exploding melting pot that allows people to embrace their skin, there is a gut reaction to retreat to the familiar in the face of panic or the unknown. Whether it's family or culture, we run back to the comfortable, edging away from anything that embodies the Other. You'll see where today's America and West Side Story collide if you mix a little politics with mambo.Take the witty scene where all the gangs attend a dance on neutral territory. To keep the peace, the host suggests a game of partner roulette, but plans change when Shark leader Bernardo and Anita (Rita Moreno) reach for each other while everyone else follows suit. Hence, the song ""Mambo"" plays as the opposing sides dance in spirited bursts that don't differ much from the choreographed fight scenes. In fact, throughout the film, Sharks and Jets mark their territory, whether women or streets, intent upon dominating the other side, ruining everyone's chances of equality or peace. Each gang draws a stark line between ""Us"" and 'Them."" Yet while the men focus on dominance and divisions, some of the women try to build bridges with wishes of prosperity and for the development of American identities.Before any blood is shed in the film, a standoff between the Sharks and their girlfriends occurs in the unforgettable number, ""America."" The men and women have different ideas of what it means for them to be an American, but again, we get this insistence on loyalty in the lyrics: ""Here you are free and you have pride, / Long as you stay on your own side."" When you stop humming this captivating tune, you start to wonder why ""America"" is so catchy. The song offers so much hope about futures with ""Cadillacs"" and ""terrace apartments,"" but it also illuminates certain truths about the limits minorities face. This scene in the film paints a picture of how Puerto Ricans come to the U.S. for success but end up in cramped apartments in condensed Spanish communities without fancy cars or appliances. This isn't so different from today's New York, where many minorities try to make do in the ghetto while having to get around on the always crowded 4 train. Still, this does not deter the hunt for identity on American soil—or as Anita would say, ""I like to be in America!"" The search for American identities and loyalties to our ethnic identities have always caused a struggle, regardless of whether or not we were born in this country or come from a mixture of ethnicities. Latinos and other minorities, even if they have the highest of hopes and the bravest of hearts, are hindered, if not crushed, by cruel realities daily. For instance, take the police officer Lt. Schrank. He constantly sniffs around at any sign of tension between the gangs, but he also doesn't hesitate to bark at the Puerto Rican Sharks to go home instead of the Caucasian Jets. He doesn't mind jumping at the chance to help the Jets for the possibility of fighting the Sharks. We can find Lt. Schranks in officers who abuse racial profiling to make an easy arrest, extremists of immigration reform policies, and even minorities who joke about other races to get a sense of superiority. There are also plenty of Anitas, who have big dreams but are disillusioned by the limits imposed by prejudice. We can find them in girls whose scholarships are based on their skin color, women who force their children to lose their accents, and children who don't distinguish race until they attend school.West Side Story has won eleven Oscars. It has been acclaimed for its music and excellent romance, and it still should be. Wood and Beymer enchant us with dreams before breaking our hearts with reality, and Rita dishes out some sass and disillusionment. Meanwhile, everyone dances on the side of the wall that they have built and maintain—not that different from the walls between countries and peoples that certain politicians wish to erect today. Whether you watch it for fun or illumination, this film deserves another award for still being an eye-opener of what it really means to live in America.",West Side Story

Growing up Latina, this was one of the first movies that I saw relatable and ""my people"" on screen. Would watch on TV every year and 50 years later still watch and sing along to.

366,praisemusictlp,West Side Story,1,9 May 2009,"I have heard West Side Story listed as one of those ""classics"" that everyone should see, but I have to say I was very disappointed in this movie. First of all, the premise of gangs dancing and singing just came off as so cheesy, fruity, and unrealistic. The music wasn't powerful...although there were 2 or 3 choruses that I liked, overall I didn't like the music. Even though it only spanned a few days time over the course of the movie, it seemed like they should've had some great ""epiphany"" lesson -- it was like the whole purpose was to say Puerto Ricans couldn't get along with the white people and I was just disappointed after expecting it to be this wonderful classic that I had heard referenced in so many other movies. Tony, although he tried to do the right thing for the wrong reason, he gets to the rumble and acts too quickly and then he does the wrong thing. Just suffice it to say I was sorely disappointed.",West Side Story

Beautiful and passionate updating of the Romeo and Juliet classic. Should be required viewing for all people. The only negative in my opinion is the dubbed singing (someone else's voice). Highly acclaimed film for many reasons. Filmed on location in New York City, the film captures big city life with all of its benefits and problems. Clearly deserved the 10 Academy Awards it won.

The message will surely appeal to the young and the old. Some of the secondary characters were marvelously portrayed. This movie will make you feel better for having watched it, something that cannot often be said of movies today, especially musicals.",West Side Story
