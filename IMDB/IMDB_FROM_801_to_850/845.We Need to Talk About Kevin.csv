0,MartinHafer,I wanted to like this film more than I actually did...but it's still well worth seeing.,7,30 May 2012,"While the idea behind ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is exceptional, I was put off by the direction of this film. While I know that a non-linear way of film making is popular these days, it's often overused--and here it is not used effectively. Too many times, the film jumps about in time and this took me out of the experience. This makes the film too unnecessarily confusing--so I am glad that I knew the plot so I could understand what was happening. Additionally, the film used a very deliberate artsy style--such as the overuse of the color red (the tomato fight, the stack of tomato soup cans, the paint)--resulting in sledgehammer symbolism. For me, the story was very strong on its own and didn't need all these tricks.Tilda Swinton stars as a mother of a child who is seriously disturbed. However, her husband (John C. Reilly) is in complete denial and inexplicably the kid is never taken to see a therapist (or exorcist). As the film progresses, the child grows from an Oppositional-Defiant child to a cold and ruthless sociopath as a teen. You never ever hear about how he is perceived by teachers and neighbors--an odd omission. However, including the child killing animals, having one of the parents in complete denial, sexually offensive behavior and the hasty behavior towards his sister are all excellent touches--which I noticed since I used to work with folks like this (which would explained why I eventually gave up being a therapist and became a teacher). Unfortunately, as the film is out of sequence, you already know that sooner or later this will all lead to Kevin committing some atrocities.Overall, this is a very compelling but frustrating film. I already talked about the film style which left me flat, but I also thought it very odd how the only one who seemed to notice anything unusual about Kevin was his mom. Even clever sociopaths are noticeable--perhaps not to everyone but to only be apparent to one person? Odd... The film is worth seeing but it just misses the mark for me--it could have been great.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
1,Leofwine_draca,Elements of interest,5,4 April 2014,"WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN is the arty, low-budget film version of a bestselling and slightly controversial book by Lionel Shriver. I knew somebody who's read the book and said it was rubbish and overrated, so my expectations weren't too high for this movie.I'm glad they weren't. Although there are elements of interest in the undeniably strong story, this is an overrated and, it has to be said, sadly lacking film. The central theme of the story, which is of guilt, is overwrought and overloaded; it's the kind of situation that could be set up in two or three scenes, but instead it's repetitively shoved down our throats for the duration of the entire movie. The director acts like she's fresh out of film school, desperate to show off her understanding of symbolism, like the bloody 'scrubbing paint' imagery which seems to be repeated with a wearying frequency.The cast is also deeply off-putting. Tilda Swinton is one of those actresses like Cate Blanchett who's incapable of bringing any warmth to her role. Admittedly it works well for some elements of this film's narrative, but it also makes her impossible to sympathise with despite the movie's best efforts; I was actively hoping she'd top herself, as horrible as that sounds. John C. Reilly is badly miscast in a serious role as her husband, although Ezra Miller as the titular character is excellent.Sadly, this kind of hard-hitting drama needs to be explicit in order to show the devastating consequences of the story build, and Ramsay shies away from showing anything throughout. I know subtlety can be effective, but this film is just too subtle. And the arty way of depicting the story via fragmented flashback is just an annoying distraction.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
2,SnoopyStyle,cold and unsettling,7,5 November 2014,"This movie jumps around in time. Eva Khatchadourian (Tilda Swinton) is a hard-partying drifter in her youth. In the present, she lives a lonely haunted life with a hostile town around her. In between, she marries the permissive Franklin (John C. Reilly) and has a suburban life with two kids. Her first child is the troubled Kevin (Ezra Miller, Jasper Newell). She's not a happy mother and they struggle to get along. Then a troubling incident sends Kevin to prison.There is a lot of good acting in this. Tilda Swinton is good with her distancing. She shows that she's slightly troubled too. Ezra Miller is cold and scary. The movie doesn't go for the easy emotions. This is a haunted, cold and unsettling story. It's not a fun movie but it is a fascinating watch.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
3,boblipton,Bad Seed?,9,30 September 2020,"From the outside, it looks like a perfectly ordinary family. From the outside, it's breadwinner John C. Reilly, housewife Tilda Swinton who works hard to make a beautiful home, son Ezra Miller, whose hobby is archery, and a cute little daughter. Such a pity that she lost an eye. From the inside, it looks very different, at least to Miss Swinton. Her son is a sociopath.This deeply disturbing movie offers the biography of a teen-ager who goes into school one day and shoots people. Reilly is, as always, excellent at playing a perfectly ordinary guy who doesn't notice anything. He doesn't even notice that his wife is expecting a child, until his son says that mommy is getting fat. He adores his children, buys his son his first bow-and-arrow set, buys his daughter a guinea pig -- which promptly disappears; Miss Swinton realizes Miller has run it through the garbage disposal.In the end, Miller goes to the school one day, locks all the exits and shoots people with his arrows. Why? What makes him a sociopath? The audience, looking for answers, is offered none.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
4,Horst_In_Translation,We need to talk about We Need to Talk About Kevin,8,21 October 2019,"""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is a British/American co-production from 2011, so this 110-minute movie is getting closer and closer to its 10th anniversary. The writer and director is Scottish (then not yet) BAFTA winner Lynne Ramsay and this movie here is probably still her most known work by far if we look at the number of votes on imdb, but also if we look at awards recognition. Oscar winner Tilda Swinton here got as close as it gets to her second Academy Award nomination, but just like Daniel Brühl and Idris Elba she had to learn the hard way that sometimes GG, BAFTA and SAG award nominations are not enough to also get in at the Oscars, even if it doesn't happen too often. Here pretty much Rooney Mara sneaked in over her. That should be all in terms of awards now. Let's take a look at the film. It is really all about Swinton. Short mentions to supporting players John C. Reilly (as the husband here a bit surprising as I expected a British actor) and Ezra Miller, who was already despite his age a pretty prolific actor at that point. Now it is arguable if he's really supporting as he plays the title character, but so do other actors and honestly, overall this film is nobody's but Swinton's, not only because she is in basically every scene.This is the story of a mother who really struggles to find love and affection for her son. We see this in obvious moments and more subtle scenes. The most obvious is certainly when she talks to her son and he is still pretty young and says something along the lines that he basically destroyed her life and she'd rather be childless in Paris right now. The fact that her husband hears these words makes it even more awkward for everybody involved. As for the more subtle scenes, I want to mention one that is rather minor, but really stayed in my mind for some reason, namely when they returned home and Kevin has his broken arm and she talks to him and says something along the lines of ""what your mother did was really really bad"". She does not say I. She talks of herself in the third person. An apology with ""I"" would have felt far more authentic and personal in my opinion. Also even with all the bad Kevin is doing, we need to keep in mind that Eva (Swinton) is far from a saint herself here. Her words on obese people are as offensive (are they true? for you to decide) as some actions and words directed at her son and other people. You will know what I mean when you see those. However, this should not lead away from the conclusion that the only real antagonist here is Kevin. There is a saying that high intelligence can get in the way of finding true happiness and I think this description also fits him. We see during the ball training as a child and when we hear him say all these numbers that he definitely has a high IQ, even if he is a sociopath and at the very end he says some line that is as brief as it is memorable about being happy. I could probably elaborate on about 20 scenes at least here how we see he is a psychopath from the very beginning. Okay not when he is a baby, even if it was probably no coincidence that he won't stop screaming in the arms of his mother, but acts peacefully when held by his father. But the ball scene I already mentioned is very telling. He knows exactly what to do, but he does not want to make his mother happy. And when he does for a moment, then he only does so that he can disappoint her right afterwards again. The kitchen scene is of course really painful to watch for me as a guinea pig owner myself. But yeah causing harm to animals at a relatively young age is always considered a recurring event for people who commit homicide later on in life. The sister's eye is also really obvious and maybe we don't even want to know exactly what happened there. It's easy to imagine with how he acts towards his sister on other occasions like the hair scene is one good example. But he is really as cold and void of emotions and love as he is to everybody else. Including his dad? Yes including his dad too. At times, it seems as if he has a better connection with him, but really with what happens at the very end, we find out it was all make-believe. He sees him as weak and not worthy of living and probably the moments Kevin acts nicer to him are only mostly so that he will keep training archery with him. Now I just mentioned what happens to the dad and sister at the very end and that was really heartbreaking honestly. One of the moments that will shake you honestly. More because of the girl than the father admittedly, but still. Another scene that had me on the edge of my seat was when Eva arrives at the school knowing a massacre had happened and when she sees the way how the doors are closed, she realizes her son is the culprit. She does not need to see him seconds later, but of course as we see him surrender to police it makes the moment even more intense with the smile on his lips and clearly he enjoys the fact that his mother is there to see what he did. She is always his target in terms of punishing her emotionally, not violently as with everybody else, especially at the ending.There is of course the scene with the broken arm again that is a prime example. He does not tell anybody what Eva really did and what happened, so he basically has something to use against her whenever he wants. And he does so, even on minor occasions just to push through with his preferences as we see when he scratches on the scar and Eva agrees to go home then and not to do some quick shopping. He just enjoys to torture his mother all the time. There is of course that masturbation scene when every other boy his age would have stopped immediately and would have been really ashamed, but he just keeps going and starts to grin. More scenes that fit the description: Like when she finds out what happened to the guinea-pig and he realizes she just found it and the way he looks at her. Or when he early on really misses the mark with his arrow and then the next shot perfectly would have hit his mother without the glass in-between. This is a film that can be talked about a lot. After the initial reaction is gone, that is. Nobody was moving until after the closing credits rolled in because as good as this film may have been, it is certainly among the most depressing movies you will ever watch. Could he have been stopped? What could have been done differently? We have moments that involve Reilly's character when we see him react in an apologetic way, of course the baby scene early on, but also a very specific moment later on when she actually says that Kevin did it (I think it was about the guinea pig) and his reaction is that maybe she should talk to somebody, so the moment she slightly asks for help, she gets a response that she is just overreacting and she is the one who is unstable. This probably also has to do with Kevin sucking up to his dad, even if admittedly the litchi/eyeball scene really could not have been any more telling. But it also shows the father's helplessness somehow.As for the technical aspects, I have seen more by Ramsay and felt her style was very easy to identify. The home video looks are not uncommon for her, also that her films frequently look older than they actually are. Or also the use of fast-forward on some occasions. It is not the first time she includes time lapse. I am not sure how she does with chronology in other films, here it is really all over the place if we look at jumps in time and there is hardly any chronology in here. The scenes that take place after the massacre are easy to identify at least because of the red color on the house and on the car. This made it a bit easier, but it sure took me a while to get used to these constant jumps in time. It's alright though. The overall impact is not too negative on the movie. Maybe it is even better the way she did it from the storytelling perspective than if she went fully chronological and me saying this sure means something because in general I almost always prefer chronology. But it also maybe makes the film a better rewatch (I don't even know if you want to rewatch with how depressing it all is) because when you find out at the end about the dead two people at the house, it gives a whole new perspective to Eva's grief, even if she was about to get divorced already. And see things and scenes differently that were depicted before that in the film. I have not read the Lionel Shriver book this is based on, so I cannot say how chronology was handled there or if Ramsay just implemented it here (or the lack thereof) and also not make any other comparisons between book and movie. But certainly the way it turned out here, this is how you should adapt a book that people finally stop with the eternal nonsense criticism à la ""The book is always better."" What stays the most from this film (except Swinton's turn) are really all the ways in which the boy is depicted as evil. So it came as a bit of a surprise that towards the end, there is always a little bit of hope as we hear his last words that he is no longer sure his motivations were the right ones. And the following hug of course. Maybe a jail term can actually turn somebody into a better human again and not just protect society. At least in this case. Anyway, this glimmer of hope went so strongly against all the calculated viciousness from before that. Also if you take the fact that he commited the brutal crime just very briefly before his 16th anniversary that his prison sentence will not be too long and there is a specific mention of that approach from the mother and also that he took drugs before that in order to create doubts about his sane mind. The irony of saying ""sane mind"" with all he did sure is priceless. And even if this is a very dark movie, there are one or two occasions of pretty dark comedy too (no arrow collecting, Jehova's Witnesses). All in all, a big thumbs-up for this film. Very good, my favorite Ramsay. One of 2011's best.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
5,nogodnomasters,"THERE IS NO POINT, THAT'S THE POINT",5,25 June 2019,"The film is told in juxtaposing flashbacks with Kevin as a teen (Ezra Miller) and a child (Jasper Newell). It centers around his mother Eva (Tilda Swinton) whose life has gone from having fun in Paris to a living hell. We know Kevin ends up in jail over some haunting event which has caused everyone to hate Eva. The film shows us injured people, a little girl with an eye patch, a man in a wheel chair and we think ""Kevin?"" The film also likes to use the color red.It is a mystery in which everyone knows what has happened except the audience. Kevin is smart, mean, and cynical. He seems to represent a generation raised on too much TV and computers, although we don't see him over indulging in either.Tilda Swinton gives us a great performance in a script that is disjointed by design to give us a specific feel. If you like a film that is designed to make you feel drained after watching it, this is it.PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, sex, brief nudity.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
6,kosmasp,Needs and other stuff,8,3 June 2012,"First of all, I haven't read the novel either. But I can honestly say, that this is an incredible performance by Tilda Swinton, something we are used by now. The story is well thought of and planned. The time framing of the movie might be irritating at first though, so be forewarned and try to be open minded.Which goes for the whole movie, because I don't think it does give you an easy answer (if you're looking for one). I think the movie is as open as it can be and whatever you read into it, reflects more on your way of thinking than it does on the movie itself. The movie gives you small bites, but you have to make a meal out them and digest them too. I hope my analogy is clear, but just in case: The movie throws up a lot of questions, that only the viewer alone can answer (if he/she is willing to, of course). Filmmaking at its finest",We Need to Talk About Kevin
7,jboothmillard,We Need to Talk about Kevin,8,22 November 2012,"I heard a lot of acclaim for this film based on the popular novel, especially during awards season, I assumed it would have been nominated an Oscar, but at least it was nominated in the other big award ceremonies, and it was a recommended film by critics, so I was looking forward to watching it. Basically Eva Khatchadourian (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Tilda Swinton) is trying to live whatever normal life she can while she has to cope with most of the country knowing what happened in her life, she did once work as a successful travel writer, but has to try and get by in a travel agency as a clerk. We see her previous life played out backwards and forwards in time as she gave birth to and raised her son Kevin, who was very troublesome while growing up, but her husband and his father Franklin (John C. Reilly) did not see these things himself. As a baby Kevin cried endlessly, as a toddler Kevin (Rocky Duer) deliberately defecated in his nappies, avoided toilet training and provoked his mother, and as a child Kevin (Jasper Newell) shows no interest in his mother's clumsy attempts at kindness and often purposely causes trouble, all this combined Eva cannot bond with her own child. By the time he is a teenager Kevin (Ezra Miller) has become a complete nightmare for his mother, Franklin over the years has bonded much better with their son and any complaints Eva makes he dismisses and makes some excuse for, they have a second child with daughter Celia (Ashley Gerasimovich) who is sweet and kind, but this does not help the family situation. Kevin does show interest in archery when his father gives him an arrow and bow as a present, and he becomes an excellent marksman, but Eva is convinced of he is vicious when she finds Celia's hamster dead and stuffed down the sink plughole, and then Celia is blinded in one eye due to an incident with caustic cleaning fluid, again Franklin dismisses these as accidents. Eva and Franklin's marriage breaks down because of her concerns for Kevin, especially because he is showing pleasure in harming things and other people, and of course this comes to a devastating conclusion when her son kills Franklin, Celia and many students in his school, and he is imprisoned for these crimes. This is the reason so many people shun her in and out of work, some people even turning violent towards her, and on the second anniversary of the event she visits Kevin as he is being transferred to an adult prison, Eva asks him why he murdered those he did, he says only he thought he knew why, but he doesn't, and they hug before he is taken away. Also starring Siobhan Fallon as Wanda, Alex Manette as Colin, Kenneth Franklin as Soweto, James Chen as Dr. Foulkes and Lauren Fox as Dr. Goldblatt. Swinton gives a terrific performance as the mother worn out and tormented by her malicious son and hated by the public after the horrific murders, Miller definitely makes an impression as the detestable teenage son who is not afraid and shows no remorse for his evil actions, Reilly does well with his moments on screen as the father and husband who just wants to keep the family together and ignores any danger, and the child actors as younger Kevin are memorable as well. The story told in backwards and forwards non-linear is interesting, it is only confusing a couple of times but overall you can understand where you are and what is happening, it is a great dark story about domestic danger and feels genuinely like a nightmare with its disturbing atmosphere, a fantastic drama. It was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Director for Lynne Ramsay and Outstanding British Film. Very good!",We Need to Talk About Kevin
8,Tweekums,Brilliant but difficult to watch,9,19 March 2017,"Eva Khatchadourian was once a successful travel writer but now she lives in a tiny house; as she leaves we see the house and her car are daubed with red paint. Her neighbours ignore her and people she meets in the street abuse her both verbally and physically. It soon becomes apparent that her son, Kevin, has done something terrible. Through a series of flashbacks we see that he was always an awkward child but only with her. Eva's husband, who we only see during these flashbacks, thinks Kevin is just 'being a boy'. There are suggestions that something is seriously wrong; the disappearance of a pet and an 'accident' which causes his sister to lose an eye but there is no proof that he was involved. The only time Kevin is seen to be nice to his mother is when he is ill as a child and she reads him the story of 'Robin Hood'; shortly afterwards his father buys him a toy bow and arrow; something that eventually leads to a proficiency in archery. Eventually we learn what Kevin has done and even though there were hints at what happened it is still disturbing.Movies are often described as 'Feel Good'; this is anything but that. It is disturbing from start to finish as we gradually learn what happened as well as seeing Eva's current life. Kevin was a disturbing child even when we see him as a baby; always crying when he is with his mother. As he grows he gets worse; defiant towards his mother; even refusing to be toilet trained till she does something drastic. Tilda Swinton does a fantastic job as Eva; one can almost feel her character's exhaustion and despair. Ezra Miller is also great as Kevin, one of the most monstrous young characters I can think of. Jasper Newell and Rocky Duer also impress playing Kevin as a youngster and an infant respectively. John C. Reilly is good as Kevin's father; a character it is easy to dislike as he can't see the wrong in his son of course he isn't horrible in front of him. Young Ashley Gerasimovich is impressive as Celia, Kevin's younger, and much nicer, sister. Given the nature of the 'Terrible Event' there is surprisingly little violence; that doesn't been it isn't disturbing though I felt uncomfortable through most of the film. Overall I'd recommend this to older viewers just don't expect to feel good when the final credits roll.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
9,moonspinner55,"Themes of guilt, blame, shame and betrayal--tinted blood red",2,2 January 2016,"Despondent middle-aged woman in the present day flashes back on her past as a wife and mother of two, having difficulty assimilating how a loving, happy union with a gentle man has resulted in the upbringing of a sociopath--her eldest child named Kevin. Ugly portrait of ruined lives, co-scripted by the director, Lynne Ramsay with Rory Stewart Kinnear, from a novel by Lionel Shriver, is told mostly in visceral terms. There's no use waiting for dialogue passages to bridge the narrative gap; Ramsay is hoping her staccato flashbacks will do the trick, but it's an arduous journey. As Kevin's mother, Tilda Swinton is the only reason to sit through the film, although her sad sack is never given a break by the filmmakers, who pile on one humiliating episode after another. Ramsay is trying to show us that mother and son are really two sides of the same coin, but her delivery of this message (complete with heavy-handed soundtrack choices) is fatuous, at best. * from ****",We Need to Talk About Kevin
10,Coventry,"Actually, I just want to forget about Kevin",8,11 January 2016,"We need to talk about Kevin? Whenever I encounter something or someone as depressing as the titular Kevin of this film, I just want to forget and focus on the more cheerful aspects of life. But the hard truth remains that I can't forget about Kevin, and I sincerely doubt that anyone who watches this film will ever be able to forget about KevinThat's just how disturbingly realistic and petrifying this motion picture by writer/director Lynne Ramsay, in fact, is! I've been a huge fanatic of controversial and shocking cult/horror movies for more than two decades now, and I've seen pretty much every notorious film and/or documentary there is available on mass murderers, serial killers cannibals, torture and bizarre fetishes, but I guarantee that almost nothing equals the nightmarish thoughts and painful aftertaste left behind after watching ""We need to talk about Kevin"" Anyone who reads a newspaper or watches the TV-journal from time to time knows that this film deals with a topic that is sadly very real and relevant, namely the story of an emotionally unstable and introvert teenager who caused a bloodbath at his/her school. Yet, the story – adapted from the novel by Lionel Shriver – doesn't gratuitously depict these gruesome actual events. The whole film is an extremely sober and stylish character study of Kevin's mother Eva Khatchadourian; who's trapped in the worst imaginable type of hell that a parent can encounter: trying to understand why all this happened. The film has a narrative structure that isn't chronological, with long sequences of a practically lifeless Eva facing the hatred of her surrounding after the tragedy (the scenes in the supermarket are so harsh), interfered with flashbacks of typical family situations of Kevin growing up from a difficult baby into a troublesome toddler and nihilistic teenager with archery as his sole passion. The flashbacks naturally hint already that Kevin was a ticking time bomb since birth and that pure evil might have been in his genes, but they simultaneously also draw a not-so-flourishing picture of Eva's mother role. Where all those little moments of infighting at the breakfast table really necessary? Isn't corporal punishment outdated since decades already? All these and more dilemmas are causing Eva to wonder whether she isn't fully responsible for what happened herself Needless to say that a film such as this one almost entirely relies on the acting capacities of the tormented mother character, and Tilda Swinton truly gives away a downright phenomenal performance. Hers is one of the most integer, honest and substantial female roles ever captured on film and she should have won every price there is to win! Does this mean that ""We need to talk about Kevin"" is an impeccable masterpiece from start to finish? Not exactly, since the role of John C. Reilly as the passive and good-hearted father (although flawlessly acted) is far too clichéd. His contradictory ""everything-will-be-alright"" and ""he-is- just-a-kid"" attitude is too obviously penned into the script to make both the characters of Eva and Kevin even colder and harsher, and on top of that, Mr. Reilly is horribly typecast. ""We need to talk about Kevin"" is a film that I will probably never watch again in my life if I have the choice – it's sad enough that we unquestionably will witness several more similar stories in the daily news – but for fans of the more challenging type of cinema, I'd say this is fundamental viewing.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

It manages to be Artistic to the point of Goush, yet its Psychological core remains totally undiagnosed.The Title suggests some concern about near autistic Children and Sociopathic Adolescents, but the Movie shows that they did need to seek Counseling and ignoring said Title is perhaps the major cause for a complete breakdown in empathetic development.This is a complex Subject and a rather complex Movie, but its conviction is never quite realized and what the viewer is subjected to is a lot of images and very little imagination about what could and would happen in a situation like this. it's pretty much textbook, what not to do.

13,evanston_dad,Book and Movie Could Have Used a Little More Ambiguity,5,27 September 2012,"The art of adapting a novel to the screen must be one of the hardest if the lack of good adaptations is any indication.""We Need to Talk about Kevin"" falls into the same trap virtually every novel-to-screen adaptation does: it becomes merely a check list of plot points from the book without ever taking on a life of its own as a movie. And my biggest problem with it is that in its efforts to stay faithful to the book, it transfers one of the novel's biggest flaws wholesale to the screen. Lionel Shriver's book leaves no doubt in the reader's mind that Kevin was a bad seed from the moment he was born, with a mom who becomes the only person in his life to see him for what he truly is. That lack of ambiguity makes the book much less interesting than it would have been had we been less sure about the mother's role in shaping her son into the monster that he eventually becomes. The movie does the same thing and suffers the same result.Tilda Swinton is one of the most fascinating actresses out there, but she's not well served by this material. The movie is too episodic and disjointed to build any kind of narrative momentum, and the effect also undermines Swinton's performance -- she's not able to develop an intriguing character because the film lacks a coherent narrative arc. John C. Reilly is miscast as her husband, who's supposed to be a good-looking, all-American kind of guy. And the little boy who plays Kevin as a toddler comes off as silly when he's supposed to be menacing.My blu-ray copy of this movie from Netflix was damaged and got stuck about an hour in. I had to scan forward to the next playable portion of the disc and as a result missed about twenty minutes of movie. It's an indication of how I felt about the film that I didn't really even care.Grade: C+",We Need to Talk About Kevin
14,ferguson-6,Cupid's Arrow,8,4 March 2012,"Greetings again from the darkness. The Brady Bunch, this isn't. It's also not the place to look for helpful parenting tips. In fact, the story revolves around Eva, a woman (Tilda Swinton) who apparently didn't want to have a child ... at least not at this time, and certainly not THIS child. If you have seen The Omen, you probably gave thanks that you didn't have a child like Damien. At least we knew Damien was the spawn of Satan. Eva's son Kevin, is instead a good old fashioned psychopath. One who has an inherent need to cause pain and misery for his mother.What a pair Eva and Kevin make. From day one, Kevin seems to sense his mother's lack of joy in parenthood. And he seems to have a genetic disposition of making her pay. As with many psychopaths, his above average intelligence makes him even more dangerous. He is tricky enough to keep his dad (John C Riley) clueless as to his nature, while causing much doubt in the dad's mind as to the stability of his wife.My favorite part is actually how director Lynne Ramsay structured the storytelling. It goes beyond non-linear and actually bounces throughout three key periods: Kevin as a baby/toddler, Kevin as a 6-8 year old (Jason Newell), and Kevin as a teenager (Ezra Miller). Each age is progressively more frightening and disenchanting, and the film begins with what is an undetermined catastrophe. This event is slowly revealed over the course of the movie, though we witness events leading up to it, as well as the resulting fallout.There are a few scenes where Eva is scrubbing the exterior of her house in an attempt to remove the red paint that was purposefully splattered. As a viewer, we understand that she has blood on her hands and she seems resigned to the fact that she is now a social outcast, even a pariah. We spend much of the movie in Eva's jumbled thoughts as she tries to piece together what has happened and why. Of course, there is no answer. The title explains what was missing all along. There was no communication and no willingness to confront the problem ... a psychopathic son. To say they all paid the price is an understatement.This film has a very limited audience, though my claim is that Ms. Swinton was quite deserving of an Oscar nomination. She wears defeat like a mask and lives in isolation better than most could. Even the music is offbeat and unusual in its use ... thanks to Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood. As filmmaking, this is high art. As storytelling, it's a bit muddled and quite a downer.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
15,FlashCallahan,I am the context........,10,15 March 2012,"Each year a film is released from nowhere that screams 'see me' and blows all other movies straight out of the water.This is the movie,and for me, the best movie released in 2011.Swinton is magnetic as the mother who is carrying more demons than any other screen character seen in a long time, and it's down to her son, the titular Kevin.Equally shared in flashbacks and present, the movie has that awful tension throughout, with red being the predominant colour, and the feel of time not moving, thanks to the use of alarm clocks.The present is a woman trying to get on with her life after an unthinkable tragedy, and the flashbacks show her ever rising struggle with her son.There is no indication as to why Kevin is how he is, but the look on the three actors who portray him, is there, done with excellent gravitas.All performances are flawless, and the false happiness within the family is actually quite depressing on hindsight.The film shows its true colour when we see Swinton standing next to a pneumatic drill, to get some peace from her sons crying.As the years go by, she begins to live with the hatred her son shows, but all of this is just a build up to the final act, when everything is revealed, which is still shocking, even though the audience know this will not end well.The school scene is seminally downbeat, but then it goes one step beyond when we get back home.The only rational reason I can conclude is that Kevin didn't kill his mother because he wanted her to live with the loss, and to hate each day of her now worthless life.It's brilliantly directed by Ramsey, each scene filled with with an aura of despair, but somehow still managing to captivate.Truly the best film last year, and would make a great evenings viewing with Herzogs 'My son, My son, What have Ye done?' You must see this.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

One can sense her character's sense of frustrations and exasperations at her son Kevin's strangely heartbreaking tendencies. I can't in good conscience say I enjoyed this artsy nature vs. nurture diatribe, yet I can say that even though I found myself disagreeing with the inevitable answer that the film seems to convey, I did respect the essence of the slice of cinema as a whole. It's the feel bad movie of the year.

18,gradyharp,'Wherein does evil lie?',8,2 June 2012,"In an interview with Lionel Shriver' about her highly successful 2005 novel she commented on the difficulty of the project: 'It was admittedly draining. And throughout, I was anxious that because I had never had a child myself, I didn't know what I was talking about and readers who were parents would catch me out.' As adapted for the screen by director Lynne Ramsay and Rory Kinnear this story becomes a terrifyingly realistic exploration of the subject of inherent evil and the manner in which we deal with it. The film is particularly timely as we read almost daily of youngsters killing classmates in schools across the country. But first the story:Eva Khatchadourian (Tilda Swinton) is trying to piece together her life following the ""incident"". Once a successful travel writer, she is forced to take whatever job comes her way, which of late is as a clerk in a travel agency. She lives a solitary life as people who know about her situation openly shun her, even to the point of violent actions toward her. She, in turn, fosters that solitary life because of the incident, the aftermath of which has turned her into a meek and scared woman. That incident involved her son Kevin Khatchadourian (Ezra Miller as a teenager and Jasper Newell as a 6 year old and Rock Duer as a toddler), who is now approaching his eighteenth birthday. Eva and Kevin have always had a troubled relationship, even when he was an infant. Whatever troubles he saw, Franklin (John C. Reilly), Eva's complacent husband, just attributed it to Kevin being a typical boy. The incident may be seen by both Kevin and Eva as his ultimate act in defiance against his mother.Ramsay tells her story in bits and pieces of a collage of moments from the birth of Kevin to his incarceration. For some this kind of non-linear story telling may be disconcerting, but for this viewer it seems like a close examination of the mind of a mother who simply cannot believe she has birthed and is raising a child who is the epitome of evil. The fact that we are aware of something hideous that has happened from the beginning does not get in the way of watching the slow maturation of Kevin - first as a constantly screaming infant to a maliciously bad little boy to a viciously cruel and evil teenager with whom his mother cannot connect except for one very telling instance when she reads the young Kevin 'Robin Hood' and his arrows, at which point Kevin shows a degree of affection for Eva. That moment proves in retrospect to be the nidus for the horror that lies ahead. Yet to say more about the story wound diminish the impact one the viewer. Tilda Swinton is extraordinary in her role as is Ezra Miller. The film. At least, for this viewer, is a powerfully disturbing one and a very fine insight into how evil deeds can happen.

19,zetes,Truly bad,3,18 December 2011,"A staggering failure. I don't know what anyone involved in this film was thinking, except for Tilda Swinton, who is the only one who walks away from it clean. Swinton plays a mother whose son has committed an atrocity. She's frequently assaulted. The only people willing to defend her are complete strangers, and even she herself believes she deserves it. The film is told in a mixed-up chronology, and we observe her relationship with her son. Here's the thing, though: Kevin, from the moment of his birth, is a demon child, no less supernatural than Damien of The Omen fame. Ramsay (and presumably the author of the original novel, Lionel Shriver) have no interest whatsoever in what makes a person do something awful. They don't have much interest in how someone deals with the guilt, either. Instead, the characters have no relation to the real world. They're just stick figures. Ramsay's excuse is that she just seems to want to make a visually interesting movie, but really, the subject is too interesting to dismiss as offhandedly as she does. Even the visuals are so stylized the film almost becomes laughable - I was always thinking, ""Oh, where's the red splotch going to be in this scene?"" You see, because red symbolizes blood, which is what Kevin shed. That's about how obvious Ramsay spells everything out. The kids who play Kevin (I think there are three of them, not counting the baby, whom Ramsay couldn't quite make seem demonic when he actually appeared (when he's unseen in the stroller, he's constantly shrieking)) are really awful. John C. Reilly has a completely underwritten roll as the father (you're always wondering just what the Hell this guy is doing that he doesn't see how evil the kid is). A few years back there was a much better evil child film called Joshua that covered a lot of the same beats. It wasn't great, either, but it beats the Hell out of this sophomoric project. Call me when you have something to say, Ms. Ramsay.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
20,StevePulaski,Thou shall speak about him on this day,8,4 June 2012,"Before we talk about Kevin, and the movie We Need to Talk About Kevin, I'd like to talk about, or for that matter question, Kevin's ethnicity. How did he manage to be Asian by two clearly Caucasian parents? Ezra Miller, the actor playing him, is very talented and likely to perform extremely well at dark, unsettling roles, but in some shots, it's a tad distracting to see a supposed biological son in a household where he is noticeably different from everyone else. Perhaps that adds to the feeling of his alienation and unemphatic personality.Moving right along, about halfway through We Need to Talk About Kevin I was sort of planning a mediocre review in my head. I felt the experience to be fragmented, lost in its own script, and very jumbled and disjointed in its narrative. I still believe so, but far more positives than I could've imagined emerged during the second and third acts. We are taken inside the head of Eva Khatchadourian (Swinton), an offbeat woman, who was once a very successful writer, now living in a dilapidated apartment barely fit for herself. This is of course where the story will end up, and the rest of the film is mainly told through non-linear flashbacks.Eva's life once looked bright, but in the blink of an eye, she was pregnant, married, and raising a kid along with her sort of oafishly ignorant husband Franklin (played by a rather miscast John C. Reilly). Nine months later, Eva gives birth to Kevin, and right off the bat, he is a handful. He cries uncontrollably, rarely interacts with his parents, and leaves poor Eva out of options.When Kevin grows up, he becomes an evil ingrate, tragically hurting his mother emotionally and continuing his anti-social and alienated behavior. Eva begins to question whether this was taught or inherent on Kevin's part, which is where the theme ""nature vs. nurture"" comes into play. Was Kevin just a bad seed from the start, or did the lack of parental guidance force him down this path of destruction? Tilda Swinton is undeniably powerful as Eva, perfectly capturing the melancholy portrayal of a doomed mother, sadly out of options. I don't think I would've felt the same about Eva had it been given to a woman like Camilla Belle, Angelina Jolie, or someone of popularity. The role of Eva needed to be inhabited by a woman of lesser known status to effectively leave an imprint on the viewer. And like I stated before, Ezra Miller does some fine work as Kevin.Speaking in terms of cinematography, the film's color pallet seems to have a giant love affair with red, so much so that various scenes involve Eva's house splattered in it and her fiercely scrubbing the red residue off her hands and floor. Red is synonymous with evil in the film, and much like Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition, it symbolizes when something bad is about to occur. It too reminds me a bit of Dee Rees' excellent debut Pariah, where many of the scenes had an explosive amount of color. Here, it's pleasant, but not necessary.The same goes for the flashbacks, which stir the art-house pot a little too vigorously. We Need to Talk About Kevin is only a couple steps away from melodramatic mumblecore, and that's a territory such a potential-filled film like this dare not enter.We Need to Talk About Kevin is efficient work from Lynne Ramsay, whose dark portrayal of a broken family is well suited by solid performances and marginally impressive photography. Yet, like the first act, there are still some things inevitably bothering me, mostly the choppy narrative structure. There's that, and the fact that the idea of raising an ingrate child who eventually goes onto do the unspeakable could almost bring people to tears, yet this and the film Beautiful Boy, another film dealing with the subject of calamity centering around a child, fail to bring justice to such emotions. We recognize that both stories are sad, but never do we react emotionally to their content.Starring: Tilda Swinton, John C. Reilly, and Ezra Miller. Directed by: Lynne Ramsay.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
21,lasttimeisaw,We Need to Talk About Kevin,8,24 March 2012,"An almost full room audience in the Febiofest for Lynne Ramsay's high-acclaimed drama about immature parenting, with a THE OMEN-esque demonic boy character who precipitates a ruthless slaughter in the school. The film dares to strain viewers' bounds of witnessing an agonizing process of a vehement duel between an unprepared and neglectful mother and her sociopathic son, and the mother's self- pondering and retribution after the brutal massacre.Ramsay (ends a 9-years hiatus after MORVERN CALLAR 2002) reprises her director ego and turns Lionel Shriver's thorny novel into a gutsy and personal character study, parading her snappy camera-work with a constantly blood-red frame-moulding, exaggerating a non-linear narrative and overstaying freezing-frames to leaves actors (Tilda Swinton & Ezra Miller namely) extensive space for their adroitness of a headstrong interpretation. There are no wanting of dashing shots and tableaux here, the opening scene of carnal intimacy with a carnivalesque immolation splattered with blood hue is singularly staggering, and what's more extraordinary is that the thrust has never ceased to mitigate until the very last scene. The film is also a formidable platform for veteran Swinton and tyro Miller, they are predominantly capturing all the gaze from beholders who hold a mixed-feeling of sympathy, empathy, detestation, horror and shock. John C. Reilly has retreated to his usual supporting stereotype, and two young actors plays Kevin's toddler and child periods are also prudently picked. The film is without exception a tough bone to chew up, and on the whole oozes a moderately showiness of its concoction of its sensational fodder and stows away some sequential detail information in order to demonstrate a chicly elliptical manner. It is a film one may shun away from a second viewing but a first encounter could reside much longer than its average peers.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

And I thought it just wasn't a good movie. That just has to do with the progression of a baby to a teen that is demented and just plain makes his own mother's life a living hell. But after finishing the flick and thinking upon it there is quite a bit of messages and signs I missed. And has more of the humanistic side and depth compared to ""The Orphan"" and ""The Omen"". Since it deals with reality and how even if a family seems all fine and dandy their might be a damaged child in the family. Mainly because of the inauthentic love and inauthentic family. And this movie did a great job showing how even though a fine and dandy a family may appear throughout their might be a child that is born screaming and feels neglected from birth. No matter how much attention they might get. Which might cause the innate evil to come out from a baby to even a teen.

23,Buddy-51,"A ""Bad Seed"" for the 21st Century",8,2 February 2013,"Every time some deranged individual goes on a mass killing spree, we rightly focus our attention and concern on the victims and the devastated loved ones they leave behind. But who thinks about the impact such events have on the family of the killer? Well, the makers of ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" certainly have, and the result is both heartbreaking and blood-curdling to witness.This grimly fascinating indie drama focuses on Eva (Tilda Swinton in a bravura performance), the mother of a troubled teen who slaughters a number of his fellow classmates in a high school assembly. The multi-tiered screenplay by Rory Kinnear and director Lynne Ramsay looks at Eva's life both after the massacre and in the years leading up to it (Kevin is played by three different actors at various stages of life). From the beginning, Kevin is clearly a problem child, a ""bad seed"" as it were, for lack of a better term (think of Damian sans the supernatural powers and Satanic bloodline). Perpetually frustrated and exhausted, filled with self-loathing and doubt, Eva spends every waking moment struggling to be a decent mother to her child, but nothing she does or says can break through the emotional barrier the sociopathic Kevin has set up between himself and the world. Eva is further isolated by the fact that Kevin even has his own father (John C. Reilly) deluded into believing that the problem does indeed lie with Eva, in her weaknesses and inadequacies as a mother – almost to the point where even Eva, at some level, begins to believe it herself. Swinton breaks our hearts every step of the way as she wages a constant, solitary battle against a force she has no hope of ever understanding or controlling - for all the parents around her seem to have no such problems raising their own, much more reasonable and malleable children. It leads us to the broader question of what happens when that most basic of all human bonds – that between a parent and a child – is irrevocably broken. And how is a parent to love a child who steadfastly refuses to love her back?And life is certainly no better for Eva after the killings, for now she is forced to live out the rest of her life as a pariah in a community that blames her in large part for the tragic loss it has suffered, a community that has no interest in reaching out to her for understanding or healing. Her fate, then, is to struggle on alone, devoid of sympathy, compassion and any chance at reparation.""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" may be one of the bleakest and most despairing portraits of parenthood and childrearing ever committed to film, but it makes for a haunting and unnerving experience that you will find very hard to shake.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
24,thesar-2,We Really Need to Talk About Parenting,8,3 March 2013,"(May contain slight spoilers.)Kevin's been a bad boy. From day one. And when momma's got to drown out her son's incessantly crying with a construction site's jackhammer, she's going down in the blame category.We Need to Talk About Kevin explores the true blame of disobedient children: parenting. I've been saying it for years, but mostly about homophobia. Kids learn hate and it stems from parenting who have held on and now teach it to their offspring. Here, the anti-gay issue is irrelevant and what's left is much more disturbing.To watch this unique movie as just a regular movie-watcher, you might be lost. It has more timeline jumps than all of the Back to the Future movies combined. It was the writer's (Lynne Ramsay and Rory Kinnear) way of telling the dark tale of the birth of Kevin to his bad teen years, back to his toddler ""phase,"" the movie's present, to right before the present and all the while, they show the absent, albeit present, parents. In other words, the movie is literally all over the place.So much so, it's tough until the finale to grasp which timeline is present day, although they do make it clear where we're at when you look at the age of Kevin.My point, get past that. By the end of the film, there is a very clear message that you should let sink in. For my journey, I not only had to let 24 hours pass before I wrote this and I spoke with a parent/friend of mine whose seen this and his thoughts. He was able to open my mind and I've thought more highly of this project than my initial opinions.The basic synopsis: It's blatant from the get-go that Kevin's not a well-balanced individual, and what absolutely doesn't help is the fact that the mother (the fantastic Tilda Swinton) clearly doesn't want to be a parent, nor likes the child much. When the inevitable, albeit VERY EARLY, rebellion appears, she either ignores it, gets frustrated with it (and you'll definitely see that) or makes half-ass attempts to ""talk about Kevin"" with the figuratively blind father.Needless to write, and all attempts to avoid spoilers are on my mind, things go south. All around.Perhaps in an age of anti-bullying rallies, movies about bullying and even a President putting his two-cents in about bullying, this is a perfect movie to watch to explain the seeds of these horrible acts. Why aren't more people focusing on the solution to the problem, i.e. going back to the beginning? Rarely do people snap without a long series of unfortunate events leading up to a horrible event.I am thankful to my friend who opened my eyes wider with this movie that's not so much about a bad kid, but bad parents. He believed, and lead me to further see, that the actions in the movie could and probably really do happen. Unfortunately, like most Americans, we only see the problem in front of us – in most cases: the actual bully – but never go outside the box to solve the problem. And save lives, both physically and future mental states.See this movie and see what can happen to those who should never be parents.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
25,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Deep, unsettling glimpse into the development of a killer",10,11 June 2012,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Told in flashback, a woman named Eva (Tilda Swinton) recalls the childhood of her son Kevin (Ezra Miller) and what may have lead him to go on and commit a terrible act.Can anyone get inside the mind of a mass killer? Can anyone understand what makes them tick and act the way they do, even themselves? Are some people just born evil, and is it just really easy to tell from a very young age? Do some people just carry a certain aura around with them that practically gives off their insidiousness in flashing neon lights, and can this rely as an accurate judgement as to what they may go on to do? Lyne Ramsey's earth shattering adaptation of the best selling novel of the same name leaves you with all these questions swirling around in your head like a tornado, and leaves a deep, lingering impression on you long after the credits have rolled.The devil's wholly in the details, and it's the subtle, understated atmosphere and style that lifts the film to the levels it's at. Despite it's big name cast, there is a fitting low budget, independent look to it that keeps it grounded in the electrifying dimension it is in. Mixed in with all the human drama that is going on, there is also an unrelenting, unnerving air of tension and mystery and to just what exactly Kevin has done that is so terrible.Performances wise, Swinton takes most of the screen time, who post traumatic incident carries herself with a meekness and passivity in contrast to the forthright, slightly pompous manner she did before (could this have had an effect on Kevin?) But the main character is Kevin himself, brilliantly played both by Jasper Newell as a child and Miller as a teenager, whose strange, creepy personality eerily makes him stand out as a mass killer years before he goes on to do it, and certainly provides more of a teenage nightmare for his parents than a certain other Kevin played by Harry Enfield ever could! It's a shame I never read the book, which I'm told is done in a slightly different style, but this is an electrifying, haunting portrayal of a phenomenon in America that happens all too often and could do with being explored with more reason and depth, and all the better that this great film does it so well. *****",We Need to Talk About Kevin
26,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A puzzle without a definitive solution; it won't hold your hand but it will make you think.,7,12 May 2018,"'We Need To Talk About Kevin (2011)' is almost like a puzzle, one that doesn't have a definitive solution but is an enigma nonetheless. It unravels itself in a loose, dynamic way in which the very fabric of the film is used as a canvas for the central character's trauma to be splashed across the screen, explored in a volatile and vibrant way that gives a real sense of some sort of post-traumatic stress. This is not a film that holds your hand, nor is it even interested in answering any of the questions it asks, not directly anyway. Instead, it portrays its perhaps controversial events in a dream-like fashion, exuding a sense of an inescapable past that might as well be happening now. It's like our protagonist is wading through a waking nightmare, unable to move on from the events that shape the film both in her head and on the streets. It's a fantastic decision, then, to put us directly in that mindset, to force us to face her fears as she does the same. We are never outside of this story, never above its characters. Instead, we are right there with them, behind their eyes, seeing exactly what they see and still just as powerless to stop it. Not only is the direction, and the decision to edit it non-linearly, perfect, but so are the performances. The eponymous kid is quite creepy, though only in the most mundane of senses, and we simultaneously feel sorry for him, want to empathise with him and truly fear him. It's only natural to be afraid of what you can't understand and the central debate, of nature vs nurture, is expertly told almost exclusively through visuals. Until, that is, the feature's only misstep, which is still a minor one, that sees the final scene dip deeper into dialogue than ever before and almost over-explain it all. Thankfully, restraint takes hold before this sequence reaches its tipping point, so it just sticks out as its most unsuccessful moment as opposed to a totally tone-deaf and destructive one. In the end, we are perhaps no closer to understanding why the events of the film happened the way they did. Certainly, there are theories you can come up with, little hints here and there that could suggest motive. That's perhaps its most realistic aspect, though. The lack of a proper, and inherently cinematic, resolution that ties everything up in a little bow. Real life isn't like that. It's messy and sometimes it doesn't make sense. People do things without good reasons, regardless of their mentalities. The lack of a definitive answer is the best full-stop the feature could have provided. Because if we want to understand the character, and prevent things like this from continuing to happen in real-life, we need to talk about Kevin. 7/10",We Need to Talk About Kevin
27,bowmanblue,A jumbled mess of occasional brilliance,6,12 May 2014,"I write this review watching the film for the first time - just after the 2012 Oscars where Tilda Swinton (and her new slightly questionable US accent) failed to pick up even a nod. I was interested to see why.My first impressions were the judges were right. The opening twenty-five minutes are basically a jumbled mess. I had no idea what was going on. It took me a while to even work out that half of the story was told via flashbacks - see Tilda's changing haircut for clues as to which timeline you're watching. You get clues to what is to come, but they're so jumbled, they're almost impossible to piece together. This is supposed to wet your appetite for what is to come, but I just found it infuriating! The filmmaker obvious wanted to be really 'out there' and did their best to insert as many meaningless and (supposed) 'arty' shots as they could which are dragged out (sometimes to bad music) and could easily be cut.After five minutes I wanted to switch it off. After ten I was fighting my hand not to reach for the remote. However, it had such high praise I felt I should give it more of a go.By thirty minutes, I have to say it was showing signs of improvement. Basically the first half hour we don't see Kevin (and when we do he's a baby). However, when the title character comes into play, we get a bit more of a story. Also, with the (proper) arrival of Tilda's troubled/troubling offspring, the filmmaker at last stops trying to relive their days at art school by cutting together random segments of 'symbolic' material and actually tell the story (at last - hooray!).It improves. Some of it. The flashbacks are linked together slightly better and make more sense. You get some element of liniar storytelling, however there are still major bits that have been - seemingly deliberately - left out (the bit with the eye I never really understood as it's only implied).Tilda also picks up the pace when she's got someone to play off of. For the first half hour she's little more than a drained zombie. If Oscars were handed out for that kind of performance every extra in Night of the Living Dead should have got one.I don't know about Tilda Swinton deserving an Oscar. I found the only real reason to watch this was Kevin. Whether it be Kevin the toddler, Kevin the boy or Kevin the teenager, I found him completely creepy and menacing. He truly is the star, making the film at least come alive with his psychoses.Bottom line: when the film is good, it's very good. When it's bad, it's practically unwatchable. It's definitely not your average film. It has plenty to be proud about, but tries to be a little too clever for its own good, leaving large chunks of pertinent information up to the viewer to decide what happened.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
28,ThomasDrufke,Nature vs Nurture,7,19 May 2019,"I can always appreciate when a movie or TV show gives us an entirely different perspective on a subject than we were accustomed to before. 'We Need to Talk About Kevin' centralizes a story about a mother dealing with the massacre her son has committed at his school. It's not often these tragedies make it to the big screen, but this one separates itself from the pack with a poignant performance from Tilda Swinton, as the mother to Ezra Miller's 'Kevin', a troubled boy who commits an unspeakable act. At the very least, this is a fascinating look into how a mother deals with the horrific things her son does while trying to balance her public presence in a town that despises her and family life, which isn't much better. An unsettled story like this is certainly difficult to direct, which is why Lynne Ramsay deserves a great amount of credit for grappling with the source material in a meaningful yet non-exploitative fashion.7.5/10",We Need to Talk About Kevin
29,secondtake,"Intense, with stunning acting and po-mo affectation, a bit exploiting but for some it will surpass",7,2 July 2013,"We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011)Kevin is a troubled child. We never learn why. He even admits at the end that he thought he once knew. Meaning, even he had no idea why things were askew. He's disturbed and sort of just nasty, a little like ""The Bad Seed"" but in a totally totally realistic (non-theatrical) way. This is something like what it would be like to deal with a child who is above average intelligence but belligerent and missing moral codes.This is a harrowing story told in a sensationalizing way. The effect is really depressing, but also agitating (if those aren't incompatible). I mean, you get discouraged by everyone's presence, even the good people who seem to be oblivious to the problem of Kevin, and yet the film is made with a quasi-artsy out-of-order harshness that makes it far from dulling. Or dull.I can see how some people would find this story important, and well done. It is both. I can also see how other people will like the ever so common method of telling a story out of order, and it does make you pay attention so that the pieces make sense. But there is another way of experiencing this film, too, and that's getting frustrated at the lack of artfulness in putting this story together, and the result on the viewer, which is a disorientation that comes not from the facts of the story but the telling of it. And the telling, the style of fracturing and disassembling the facts, gets weirdly the same, despite all the dissonance.It isn't like we are experiencing the situation through the disordered mind of some character, or that the movie is recreating the main character's disordered life. It's more just an aesthetic effect that forces us into a mood, filling every scene with confusion and anxiety. It is gradually put together, so that the snippets of crowds screaming or ambulances flashing or a little girl with an eye patch all have logical sense. But then what? Catharsis? Empathy? Lingering angst?What is clear is the serious intentions of everyone involved, most of all Tilda Swinton as the mother of the child and the imperfect protagonist throughout. Her acting, as always, goes beyond what most actresses manage, or want to manage. (Even the versatile Cate Blanchett, for example, always gives her characters a kind of polish and glow.) There is no glow here. Swinton penetrates and makes you feel for her, and worry for her. And she goes through a huge range of hair styles and situations, including a perplexing (and never explained) saturnalia in Italy (perhaps) with thousands of people in a tomato blood bath where she seems to be tripping. (Is this some weird suggestion that doing drugs causes disjointed children?)Kevin, despite being the title role, is a lesser part, played by three different actors (to cover the different ages, one just a toddler). The main point here is to create the reason for the mother's feeling of horror at her situation. And her inability to quite cope. The father, by contrast, who trundles home from work oblivious to the rotten day the mother has had, is all cheer. Kevin is convincing, sometimes making you almost gasp because he's really a rotten kid, but you will also probably think, about the mother: Why don't you say something? Why do you let him get away with that?The unpleasantness of the movie, and the feeling that it's basically a true story for someone, somewhere, made me almost tune out after getting halfway. In a way, the effect of the second half is rather like the first half, just more so. And then there's the terrible climax.If you liked this movie, or if this sounds like the intense experience you want, check out Swinton's role in ""Julia,"" which is also really gutwrenching and for me a better movie. ""Kevin"" is certainly impressive and effective, if you don't mind being slightly abused by the process.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

This is one of the most difficult experiences I have ever had watching a movie. Much like ""American History X"" this movie makes you feel contradicting feelings throughout and the end leaves you wondering why. Not since the ""Passion Of The Christ"" has a movie had such an effect on me that I hard a hard time talking when it was over. I really cannot explain this movie in words that will do it justice to the way that I felt about it but this is a movie that made me feel sick to my stomach, angry as hell and utterly helpless all at once. One of the most important movies of the year, but one that I don't think I could ever watch again. If you can handle it you should do whatever you can to see this. A movie you want to tell everyone to watch but at the same time are afraid to. Disturbingly haunting and emotionally draining as well as being the most powerful movie I have seen maybe ever. Overall, a reminder of the power that a movie can have. I was left stunned for hours by this movie. I give it an A+.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
31,Reno-Rangan,How do you define a parenting failure!,6,24 November 2016,"The film was based on the book of the same name, directed by a Scottish director. A psychological thriller, one of those what some people feel uncomfortable watching it. The film holds a suspense from the past event, it is not going to be revealed until the final quarter. Till then makes us to keep guessing it. Followed by the pieces of flashback, the story of a mother who struggled to raise his first born, a boy named Kevin was told.It takes us to show how happy she was before. Once she got pregnant, everything changed in her life forever. She failed to understand her son. Ever since he was a baby, he had given her a lot of trouble. When he reaches his teenage, it becomes even more complication to her to handle him and events around him. But a big blow is what shocks the entire neighbourhood and her life turns a hell.Shot within a month. Tilda Swinton's one of the best, maybe the best of all the bests. She should have been nominated for the Oscars. I think that's one of the greatest snub ever. The supporting cast was amazing too, including John C. Reilly in a small part and particularly those Kevins from different ages. The overall tone was great, the atmosphere was created perfectly to the kind of story it dealt.I should have watched it earlier, but you know the type of film we look for and moods, all some times influence to miss a film narrowly. Anyway, it was on my watch list and I am finally going to scratch that off. It was a good film, but there's nothing special. The theme was strong, and seems like straight out of a real event, particularly these things are common in the United States. So if you are an American or familiar with the American culture, it will interest you.This is not as inspiring film, but kind of factual film like parenting failure. The end was disturbing, yet there's nothing bold revelation in the narration. Definitely an interesting take, though blaming parents, especially the mother was kind of disappointing, as well as depressing. That's why the tale was commenced since pregnant till the final twist. Actually, it was the editing tricks that make the film to have a twist. Otherwise, it is a straightforward story. Not bad for viewing once. It was slow and too long, if you think you can manage that, then you could try it.6/10",We Need to Talk About Kevin
32,tomgillespie2002,"An exceptional exploration of grief, memory and guilt",9,14 December 2011,"I must confess that I have not read Lionel Shriver's 2003 novel that  this film is based. What I do know is that the books structure is  assembled with letters written from mother to father after the events  involving their son. The film however, uses an altogether more  intricate, fractured reveal through the tragic memories of a mother  dealing with an alarmingly profound problem. The escalation of Kevin's  (Ezra Miller) behaviour towards his mother, Eva (Tilda Swinton), is  seen in flashback. Fragments of information scatter the narrative: In  infancy, Kevin's screaming becomes unbearable for Eva, she stands for a  moment of pure bliss next with baby in tram, stood next to road works,  the immense concrete driller becoming simply a different (and therefore  perfect) emitter of high decibel noise: Kevin treats his mother with  disdain, whilst having a seemingly normal relationship with his father,  Franklin (John C. Reilly).  Whilst we are aware throughout the film that the Kevin of the title is  to commit a horrific act in the Columbine-style massacre, the film  never really focuses on him as the simple arbiter of evil. As the  structure is based around the grief stricken memories of the mother, we  are given elements of her memories and their relation to Eva's search  for any form of reasoning behind what caused this to occur. She visits  her son in prison, and their pained relationship is laid bear.  This is Lynne Ramsey's first film since 2002's Morvern Callar, and is  an exceptional exploration of grief, the accumulation of memory, and  the guilt association with parenthood. What would any parent think of a  child who goes to high school and attacks the students with a crossbow?  Both pivotal performances from Tilda Swinton and Ezra Miller are  excruciatingly brilliant (if Swinton does not get an Oscar nomination,  I will eat a handful of flesh-eating ants). Whilst not an easy subject  to deal with, the way in which it has been written, directed and  performed makes it absolutely essential viewing. Possibly the best film  of 2011.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
33,howard.schumann,Inability to empathize with others,7,25 February 2012,"""There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn't true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true."" – Soren KierkegaardAccording to journalist Chris Hedges, ""Those who cannot love are spiritually and emotionally dead. They affirm themselves through destruction, first of others, and then, finally, of themselves. Those incapable of love never live."" This emotional deadness and inability to empathize with others is reflected in fifteen-year-old Kevin (Ezra Miller) in Lynne Ramsay's first film in nine years, We Need to Talk about Kevin, the chilling story of a sociopathic teenager who commits a horrendous crime (not explicitly shown), one for which his mother must endure the anger and resentment of the community.Based on a novel by Lionel Shriver and co-written by Ramsay and Rory Stewart Kinnear, We Need to Talk about Kevin builds a fractured narrative told from the point of view of Kevin's mother Eva Khatchadourian (Tilda Swinton), a former big-city dweller who loved to travel and write books until she became a mother. Unfolding as if in a fevered dream and told in a stream of flashbacks and flash forwards, a now depressed and solitary Eva looks back at key emotional tripping points along her son's destructive journey.At the outset, we are immersed in red, a frequent motif throughout the film. Here, we see a young Eva and other revelers bathed in a sea of tomatoes at a festival in Spain, which, in its orgy-like quality, is a hint of what is to come later. The scene then moves forward in time to a city intersection where the sound of a worker's drill creates a dissonant symphony with the unstoppable cries of Eva's infant son Kevin. Eva and her little boy (Rocky Duer, Jasper Newell) live in a well-to-do suburban house with husband Franklin (John C. Reilly) and little sister (Ashley Gerasimovich. These surroundings stand in sharp contrast to the box-like home in a run-down neighborhood where Eva is shown years later, a house spray-painted in red by outraged neighbors.By the age of six, young Kevin has already become a master manipulator, refusing to speak and still wearing diapers. His deviously destructive behavior is directed towards his mother and he is skillful in knowing how to use it for maximum psychological effect. Though Eva takes him to a doctor, he simply reassures her that there is nothing physically wrong with Kevin, only that he may need more time to mature. No reason is provided for Kevin's behavior, but it is clear that Eva resents being a mother and this is made real by her apathetic self-pity. She tells him, ""Before you were born, Mommy used to be happy!"" Now Mommy wakes up every day and wishes she were in France!"" Her frustration erupts when she throws Kevin against the wall, breaking his arm for his refusal to be toilet trained, not the best way to make an emotional connection.She receives little support from her husband who refuses to believe that his son has severe emotional problems, but instead questions his wife's sanity. Instead of confronting the issues, Franklin ignores them, giving Kevin a toy bow-and-arrow set and later a high-powered bow, without any consideration of how they might be used. The father's lack of understanding prevents Kevin from being disciplined in the way that he should and there is no discussion of counseling with teachers or support groups, or professional therapy when it is obviously badly needed. Though the film's title is We Need to Talk about Kevin, apparently nobody thinks that that might be a good idea.After the violence is committed, Eva has to cope with the contempt of her neighbors. She gets a job with a travel agency but is verbally berated by a co-worker (Alex Manette) at a company Christmas party. In an episode bordering on the surreal, Eva drives through a menacing crowd of Halloween trick or treaters to the background of Buddy Holly singing ""Every Day."" Mundane events such as walking down the street or shopping at a supermarket become fraught with danger. When two religious missionaries come to her door, she uses the opportunity to turn on herself, telling them that there is no point in talking because ""I'm going straight to hell. Eternal damnation, the whole thing."" While We Need to Talk about Kevin is an engaging and often gripping film that offers outstanding performances by Swinton and Miller, it is torn between being an exploitative horror film and a psychological family drama and ends up not being very successful at either. Marred by its inability to decide whether to blame ineffective parenting for Kevin's behavior or to blame the fact that he was just born ""evil,"" the film takes no stand at all, apparently throwing up its hands and saying, sometimes ""bad"" things happen for no reason, a dubious premise.While some may see the film as wisely left open to interpretation, the fact is that there is little to go on in drawing any conclusion. Ramsay never really probes either side of the question, surfboarding over the waves and not dealing authentically with character motivation or development. Though, to its credit, the film displays an unanticipated forgiveness towards Eva by a school victim confined to a wheelchair, in its totality, We Need to Talk about Kevin is more of a display of rage, hatred, and victimization than an attempt to provide new insight or have us see the characters as flawed human beings rather than as spawns of Satan.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
34,TheMovieDiorama,We Need To Talk About Kevin nihilistically captures mental deterioration through a youthful massacre.,9,9 April 2020,"Motherhood. The femininity of parental guidance many believe vital during a child's upbringing. The sacred unbreakable bond between mother and offspring. Palpable. Producing a righteous trajectory in life, granting their children the most beneficial opportunities possible. For newly born Kevin though, his maternal bindings with mother Eva were far from archetypal. Incessantly crying whenever cradled in her arms. Deliberately antagonising her, relinquishing creativity and freedom. Appearing to purposefully loathe her, rebuffing any attempt at affection she supplies. Frustration nestles in Eva's splintered mind, driving her to throw Kevin harshly against the wall, breaking his arm in the process. Control was his when falsifying real events, enabling him to emotionally manipulate Eva for the continuous future. Years later, puberty manifests within Kevin. His mind succumbing to sadistic visions. Inflicting psychological and physical pain upon those close to him. Until eventually, he commits a massacre that alters the mentality of its townsfolk.Director Ramsay acutely shifts narrative expectations, boldly avoiding Kevin as a character. This psychological thriller's fragmented structure, comprising of reflective flashbacks and present acceptance, transfers story responsibility to Eva. Kevin's fragile yet strong-willed mother, dealing with the verbal and bodily hostility that her neighbourhood supply. Yet, as the feature progresses, it is transpired that Eva herself is the soul who lost nearly everything in life. Ramsay explores this sense of hopelessness, a path of redemption, through the character of Eva. The background psychology abrasively avoids Kevin as a character, solely analysing his mother instead. Her detached interactions with said child. Her depressive state of mind. Slight compulsions in her behaviour. Indicatively conveying the succinct dispensing of parental attitudes, and how they can affect a child's upbringing.Whilst exploration into Kevin's cynical origins was lacking, merely exploiting the structure for a narrative premise, it conversely functioned as an enigmatic stepping stone into the psyche of Eva. Ramsay continuously forced the camera to observe her natural reactions whenever Kevin committed an atrocity. Conversational pieces would always focus on her. Again, it's not Kevin story. It's Eva's. Ramsay yet again subverting expectations, whilst employing a progressively intriguing structure that blends two varying characterisations of Eva.Exerting energy and expending days cleaning her damaged house and belongings, after they had been engulfed in a red substance. Symbolising the blood that Kevin spilled upon the town, and how she is unable to wash her hands of his actions, partially feeling responsible. The implementation of overbearing red throughout the feature exemplifying the emotionally intense battle for power between Eva and Kevin. Impeccably directed, every shot of McGarvey's cinematography was sensational and provided a thematic inclination to the onscreen horrors. Rarely showing the ghastly actions Kevin took upon himself, allowing the audience to imagine the shocking endeavours instead. Incredibly powerful. Bolstered by a spacious screenplay that enables the pleasing visuals to tell a story.The real shining star however, in what is a career best performance, was Swinton. Undoubtedly, perfection. There was not a single pitch out of place within her role as Eva. She beautifully embodied the emotional resonance of the character whilst applying additional nuances to her physical fatigued transformation during the present storyline. Honestly? Faultless. Miller was also outstanding, exuding a menacing aura forcing Kevin to be unhinged even during the most calming moments. The purposeful employment of Reilly, whom was indeed overshadowed by everyone else, aided in enhancing the bond between Swinton and Miller. A meticulous choice to grant him a lesser role, to ensure the spotlight was not removed from Swinton.One could argue that Ramsay's adaptation of Shriver's novel provided commentary on American accessibility to youthful violence. Or perhaps media representation outing Eva to be the matriarchal figure of a monster, whom is equally to blame. Personally, these were not Ramsay's attempts. It's a literal bond between mother and son. Emphasising how delicate upbringing can shape malleable souls into becoming members of society. Powerful, palpable and pragmatic. We Need To Talk About Kevin is extraordinarily overlooked, and is a near-perfect contemporary psychological character study. But perhaps we need to talk about Eva instead...",We Need to Talk About Kevin
35,Movie_Muse_Reviews,One of the most challenging films you'll ever watch,8,26 July 2012,"It's hard — impossible really — to understand why a person would commit an atrocity like a mass killing. We understand loneliness, anger, desperation — but what pushes someone that far over the edge? So often we chalk it up to mental illness, often to avoid the discomfort of attempting to fathom that kind of empathy. ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" stares this notion down through the lens of a mother's grief, guilt and self-inflicted punishment.The subject matter isn't an easy one, and not because of the sensitive topic, but because it's so hard to relate to any scenario that could possibly lead down such a dark path. Scottish filmmaker Lynne Ramsay dares to lead the way, crafting one of the most emotionally challenging film experiences you'll ever have. ""Kevin"" is frustrating, horrifying and difficult to sympathize with it, while also chillingly poetic and visually poignant. Ramsay, who directs a script she co-adapted from Lionel Shriver's book, boldly and beautifully weaves together different parts of the mother, Eva's (Tilda Swinton), story. There's the tortured present-day Eva trying to live with all this, her flashbacks to the day her son Kevin (Ezra Miller) commits a school massacre, and scenes that recount pivotal moments between Eva and Kevin from Kevin's birth until the tragedy.The cinematic craftsmanship used to tell this chronologically disoriented narrative as well as the unfiltered and stripped performance of Swinton keep the film in a certain realm of excellence that the story might otherwise shatter. It's so difficult to believe the implied notion of Kevin essentially being the spawn of Satan and that Swinton could be so clueless as to lack all maternal and disciplinarian instinct in handling the situation.Eva is a character we sympathize with in the present day but whom we grow to dislike to an extent as we learn more and more about Kevin's upbringing. Post-massacre, for whatever reason, she continues to live in the town affected by her son's actions. Her new home has received a coat of red paint splattered across the front door, and she spends all her free time cleaning it off. In isolation, memories of raising Kevin, implicitly ones in which she wishes she could change what she did, flow freely in and out of her conscience.As a baby, Kevin wouldn't stop crying in his mother's arms and postpartum depression ensued. As a toddler, Kevin refused to comply with basic requests and tasks yet exhibited no signs of autism or behavioral disorders. He wasn't potty-trained until he was what looks like eight, quite possibly because he wanted the attention. His relationship with his mother only grew more distant as she didn't know how to respond to these outbursts.The nature of Kevin's malevolence in some way is exaggerated because we're to recognize that much of how we are seeing Kevin is through his mother's recollections after the massacre. She's blamed herself for not seeing all the signs and has manifested that guilt into her memory. Nevertheless, we as viewers struggle mightily with embracing it as truth. Perhaps the fact of the matter is that in order to create a character capable of such real-world evil, Kevin needed to be more extreme than any character we've ever seen. Miller gives Kevin with some believable rebellious teenage qualities, namely in the way he talks to his mother, but he's also portrayed with a near-supernatural darkness reminiscent of a horror film.What we can understand is Eva's inner monologue. We don't agree with it in a lot of the Kevin scenes, but Swinton grants us unfettered access into Eva's every thought. This gives Ramsay a greater degree of freedom in her use of visual symbolism. Nearly every scene is rife with metaphor, and our ability to identify Eva's every emotion through Swinton's performance allows Ramsay the ability to communicate through more abstract means. From the opening scene onward we are treated to images of messiness and disarray, of raw, pulpy filth and even mild self-mutilation. It both informs and aggravates the story being told, which adds to the difficulty of enduring its 112 minutes.For some, the challenge will be too great to bear, but for others, namely those who can key in on Swinton's performance and Ramsay's expert imagery, ""Kevin"" will be one of 2011's finest films.~Steven CThanks for reading!

The story is told in a back and forth time shifting manner which is at first distracting, and that is the bad, but by the second half, as the clueless mom(Swinton), and completely oblivious dad(John C.

38,jadavix,Ridiculous and unpleasant,3,4 October 2019,"I couldn't finish this movie, so if you're reading this looking for a proper review, stop now. I review every movie I watch or even give up watching on IMDB to keep track of what I've seen and what I thought about it; this is for my own records only.I had hopes for Lynne Ramsay after watching ""Ratcatcher"" and ""Morven Callar"". But with ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" and ""You Were Never Really Here"", she seems to have found a cottage industry in filming ridiculous material in an an arty and serious way, which is apparently enough to fool the movie going public.You already know what ""Kevin"" is about: Tilda Swinton as a mother of a psychopathic child who perpetrates a Columbine-style massacre. We get flashbacks to his childhood that demonstrate the stupidity of the film's title: no, we don't need to talk about Kevin. We need to talk about Swinton's Eva and get her some medication to help her deal with the psychosis she is suffering from that allows her to hallucinate the existence of her ""son"".No child like ""Kevin"" has ever existed. Damian from The Omen trilogy was more believable than this boy. He is not a psychopath. He is not a budding mass murderer. He is the embodiment of everything Eva hates, put on earth to make her suffer, neatly deposited into the body of a small human being. Even before he can talk, he deliberately does exactly what she doesn't want him to do, anything that digs at her.Yes, there have been psychopathic children. But there have never been toddlers who can telepathically read their mother's mind to find out exactly what would hurt her the most, and do just that thing. There have never been little boys who, after their mother has just accidentally broken their arm, lie to their father about the cause of the accident because they (somehow) know that if the truth comes out, the family will be split up, and then they won't be able to torment their mother anymore. Oh, and why did the broken arm happen? Because the kid keeps deliberately ""pooping"" his pants, just so the mother will have to change them. A job she hates. Which of course he knows. That's why he keeps doing it.I have read accounts of the childhoods of serial killers, mass murderers, spree killers. None - I repeat, none - were anything like this. In fact, the majority of psychopaths do not become killers. The real danger psychiatrists believe psychopaths pose to ordinary people is the burden they become when people try to help them. With no impulse control, they're generally living lives of compete disarray.That lack of impulse control is nowhere to be seen in ""Kevin"". He's the superhuman psychopath we used to only see in comic books - a super villain with genius intellect, telepathy, and an ability to bide his time and wait for the exact moment to strike that no child ever has or ever will possess.The kid being such an evil mastermind doesn't even work in the reality of the film. Consider the fact that the first time we see him, as a little boy, we can tell at a glance that there is something wrong with him; no evil child in any of the evil-child sub-genre of horror flicks has ever looked so, well, ""evil"" as Kevin does, and at such a young age. If he's so clever from such a young age to devise all these torments for his mother, why doesn't he know enough to act friendly with everybody else? He does it with the dad, sure. But not with anybody else.The movie just becomes a repetitious series of scenes depicting ""Kevin""'s cruelty toward his mother. It's not believable for a second, but it is very upsetting, so you wonder what the point is. ""Snowtown"" was more upsetting than this, but it was also highly realistic, depicting actual events and providing fresh insight into an ugly reality. ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is a nasty fantasy designed to profit from people's ignorance of psychopathy.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
39,freemantle_uk,Your worst nightmare,8,9 December 2011,"We Need to Talk About Kevin is certainly a movie that will be every  parent and would-be parent's worst nightmare. This movie gained a lot  of praise at the Cannes Film Festival and attempts to explore the  themes of society, parenting and psychology.  Eva Khachaturian (Tilda Swinton) is a middle-aged mother hated by her  community and struggling with the aftermath of a tragedy. Her  sociopathic teenage son, Kevin (Ezra Miller), has committed a school  massacre and she has to deal with the results of the sins of her child  and explore how Kevin turned out this way in a dual narrative.  After being unable to make her version of The Lovely Bones, Lynne  Ramsey turned to adapting this Lionel Shriver novel instead. She  delivers a haunting, slow-moving film that looks at the personal and  social impact of the tragedy through one person's eyes as well looking  at the struggles of raising a troubled child. Ramsey made sure there  was a grim, somber tone and kept a minimalist view of the world, yet  still adds her own visual flair with intense, slow close ups and red  imagery throughout the film to symbolise blood on Eva's hands.  There is a deliberately disjointed narrative throughout the movie,  cutting from the present to the past as we examine Eva's inability to  bond with her son. Ramsey took the bold step to avoid showing any of  the actual massacre and most violence is committed off screen. We do  not need to see it to understand its impact on people. Nor did we see  Kevin's preparations for the massacre: We Need to Talk About Kevin is  Eva's story, not Kevin's.  But there is a major problem with Ramsay's approach to the story: she  seems to ignore the entire concept of nature vs. nurture. Eva being  portrayed as a bad mother is outweighed by the way Kevin is shown as  practically the product of Satan's loins. Throughout the film, Kevin is  always pushing his mother's buttons and made out to be evil from the  day he is born. There is no subtlety in his portrayal, even with basic  things like reaction shots. We Need to Talk About Kevin should have  been more ambiguous, because the whole point of the film is to raise a  debate. The audience is not meant to have a clear answer.  Swinton's performance was highly praised and she is worthy of an Oscar  nomination as her character Eva, who starts off both as a woman at a  real low end and her struggles with a child she does not want. She is a  disaster of a mum to Kevin as a young child, a child who tests her  patience. Swinton was able to bring real depth to her character. When  she does make the effort, the damage is already done. Throughout the  movie, Swinton plays a tragic and lonely figure who is isolated in some  form, a character who is a shell of her former self.  Kevin is strongly played by two actors: Jasper Newell plays Kevin as a  little brat, pushing his mother with his behaviour and playing Eva and  his father (John C. Reilly) against each other. As a teenager, Erza  Miller portrays Kevin with a sociopathic and nihilist outlook. He has a  sharp mind, but enjoys inflicting pain on others, including his little  sister (wonderfully played by the young Ashley Gerasimovich). He is a  character who believes in nothing and takes a destructive path as a  sinister air is always around him.  Reilly plays Franklin as a normal suburban dad, someone who wants to do  the right thing for his children. It was a wonderfully natural  performance of a man who just sees Kevin's behaviour as being typically  boyish. He is very deserving of a Best Supporting Actor nod for such a  believable performance.  There is a permanent, chilling sense throughout the film thanks  Ramsay's low key direction and the power of the performance. This is a  film that should stick in your head, but We Need to Talk About Kevin  should not have been so clear-cut.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

Some questions that it provokes: 1)Did the NRA pay for this, to show that America's monthly Adam Lanza-type escapades could result in as many or more first graders being massacred with a bow & arrow set, compared to the Bushwhacker machine gun these sociopaths usually employ? 2)Doesn't writer\director Lynne Ramsay realize that rifle bullets fly about 20 times faster than arrows, meaning that potential victims of a lone bowman can fairly easily dodge and duck out of the way once the element of surprise is erased by the screams of the first victim? (It seems unlikely Ramsay has ever played a first person shooter game in her life; why didn't she spend a little bit of her budget to hire a gamer consultant, since the movie portrays Kevin as a gamer?) 3)Didn't Kevin's ""Gladstone High"" have any soccer jocks (the movie apparently is set in Ramsay's England)? If so, why didn't they kick or head a text book at him to deflect his aim BEFORE the second victim was hit? 4)Do all the random townspeople haul off and hit Kevin's mom Eva in the face as they pass her on public sidewalks BEFORE his bow hunting episode (prompting Kevin's over-protective revenge on Society) or AFTER (perhaps because she didn't strangle him as a toddler for resisting potty training)? 5)Did Adam's mom show him this movie and tell him to do her first if he was going to follow Kevin's lead (tellingly, Adam and Kevin both come from families of four broken apart because one parent was hellbent on being an enabler to a sociopath)?

41,meeza,Some good and some bad in Kevin,7,20 January 2013,"I need to write about ""We Need To Talk About Kevin"". Why? Because it's the next movie on my list to review. ""We Need To Talk About Kevin"" stars Tilda Swinton as Eva Khatchadourian, a mother of a psychotic teen who killed numerous students in a school massacre. That would be Kevin, who is portrayed by Ezra Miller. And maybe if more psychiatrists would of had a need to talk to Kevin during his childhood there would be no need for me to write about ""We Need To Talk About Kevin"". Confused? I sure am. Anyways, it is no easy picnic for Eve after Kevin commits the gruesome school crime; and that is showcased during the first act of the movie when Eve's house is splattered with red paint everywhere, gets slapped around by angry mothers in supermarkets, and gets treated as a monster by her colleagues at her new job. Kevin's fury against his mother is presented during the film during his early & late childhood, and obviously his adolescence. John C. Reilly portrays Eve's husband Franklin, who tends to underplay Kevin's manipulative ways during his upbringing. Director Lynne Ramsay's directorial effort was decent, but it needed more of a parallel structure in the telling of the narrative; its unevenness detracted from the film's efficiency. Moreover, Ramsay and Rory Kinnear's screenplay needed to have a bit more talk from the adolescent Kevin to provide us more indicators and signs on what propelled him to commit such a vicious act; sure, some had to do on making a point to his mother, but there had to be more why Kevin would go that violent extremity. Tilda Swinton was very good as Eva Khatchadourian, but it is difficult to catch-her-doing a bad acting performance. As much as I love John C. Reilly, he was definitely miscast as Franklin. Ezra Miller was mesmeric in his performance as Kevin, but very much underutilized by Ramsay. I wanted more Miller time!

That's the point. ¨Before we begin talking about Kevin, let's talk about some of the technical aspect of this film which was directed by relatively unknown Scottish director, Lynne Ramsay. She got some recognition in Britain for her short film Gasman, and was later nominated for a BAFTA award for her first feature film, Ratcatcher, in 1999. We Need to Talk About Kevin is more of a breakout film for her because it did get a lot more recognition than her previous films. It even landed among many critic's favorite movies of 2011 lists. The screenplay was adapted by first time screenwriter Rory Kinnear from the controversial 2005 novel of the same name by Lionel Shriver. The adaptation is pretty good although the film does lack a bit of pacing and it is very silent at times. Ramsay puts a little too much emphasis on style and sometimes forgets to tell the story. She bombards us with similar images over and over again, and with the color red. It's a good exercise in style, but sometimes it could feel a bit empty if the narration doesn't flow along with it. Malick was able to play with imagery and style much better in The Tree of Life, but here I just felt many of the things were being forced and over emphasized. I did enjoy this film a lot, but it did take me a while to get into the story. I think I enjoyed the second half of the film much more than the first. Many people walked out of the theater so I know this isn't a movie for everyone. It is a small independent film which focuses a little more on style and art than on trying to be entertaining or just telling a story. It's a bizarre rare film that is worth the watch if you pay close attention to the details and the performances.The film is non-linear as it jumps back in forth in time as the protagonist, Eva Khatchadourian (Tilda Swinton), recalls her life. Her son has done something terrible, he is in prison, and she has to live with the guilt of what he's done. The neighbors have thrown red paint all over her house and car for some reason, while we see a memory of Eva recalling one of her trips to Spain. She was having the time of her life as we see her during a famous tomato festival (the film opens with this emphasize on the color red), but her travels and adventures seem to be put on hold when her boyfriend, Franklin (John C. Reilly) leaves her pregnant. The film continues to jump back and forth as we see Eva adapting to her new life after the terrible act his son has committed and while she is pregnant and depressed with trying to adapt to her new life. We see images of her really unhappy during her pregnancy, and when her son is born she can't seem to connect with him. Eva does all she can to raise her son Kevin (Played by Jasper Newell during his toddler years and by Ezra Miller when he's a teen), but he seems to make her life impossible. Kevin hates his mother and defies her in every aspect. Her father seems to think he is normal, but her mother knows there is something wrong with her kid. Eva may not be the perfect loving mother, but she does try her best and is patient with the kid. She even has a second child named Celia (Ashley Gerasimovich) who turns out to be love, sweet, and innocent, everything Kevin isn't. We've seen many Hollywood films that deal with this evil born child premise. Usually they explain it by saying he is some sort of a devil spawn or something spiritual like that. This film is nothing like that. This kid, Kevin, is pure evil and we really don't know why. Perhaps he felt the depression his mother had when he was in her womb. He never felt loved by his mother although she did try to connect with him. It's easy to blame the mother for his behavior, but in the film we can't see anything she might of done to him that would lead him to hate her. The only time Kevin could have felt rejected was during Eva's pregnancy. Is it possible that the kid could've felt this unhappiness and depression from his mother's womb? From the moment Kevin was born the purpose of his existence was to make his mother's life miserable. She did care and love Kevin and tried to do her best by being forgiving, but Kevin was really incorrigible. What could her mother have done? The answer is pretty simple. Try to get help, send her kid to a psychiatrist or something. The worse thing she could've done was continue as if everything were normal. Her husband should've supported her and helped her. The real problem was that there was no communication in the family and that might be a reason the film is so silent. The performances are really terrific, especially from Tilda Swinton and Ezra Miller. Swinton makes you sympathize with her at times, while Miller is just terrifying. This film worked really well as a horror film and I really enjoyed the originality of it, although I do agree it has several flaws. Still, it is a movie that haunts you and leaves you thinking about it long after the film is over.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",We Need to Talk About Kevin

45,valleyjohn,Gid acting spoilt by a confusing timeline.,7,2 January 2012,"You hear all kinds of stories about really troublesome offspring and i think it must be awful to have brought up a child only for them to turn into a complete and utter nightmare.We need to talk about Kevin is a critically acclaimed movie about a mother , who from the day her son is born , struggles to bond with him and in turn he turns into a horrible , vindictive person and ultimately he commits the worst crime possible.Although the critics raved about this film , i didn't quite like it as much as them. I struggled at first with the chronological order of the film. It drifts from one timeline to another and it's hard to keep up. Despite the impressive performances from Tilda Swinton and Ezra Miller , the film never seems to have any real beginning , middle and end and lacked any real structure. The dialogue is good though and it's looks great but it didn't quite hit the emotional highs that i was expecting.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
46,robertemerald,Different vision is extraordinary,9,14 March 2019,"The early part of this film is a progression of images that seem random. Are we viewing flashbacks or prescience? It's worth hanging in there. Oddly things never really become clear until much later in the film, but luckily by then one has become absorbed by the meatier drama being delivered. And it is engrossing. The use of staggered imagery out of sequence is a device we've grown used to as a viewing public, and Kevin takes full advantage of that, and delivers a mind-blowingly intense and engrossing drama. A sense of horror to come is what keeps one on edge and ready to see what happens next. It is brilliant film-making, backed by strong performances, particularly the mother, through whom we see events unfold, and whom must bear the full weight of each new development. The child acting is also a wonder. I was also impressed by the way BBC Film has produced here a movie that could almost be termed suburban Americana, and may even qualify as a very fine example of such. Kevin is certainly a very fine example of an highly original and modern movie.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
47,jadepietro,Sonny Dearest,6,18 March 2012,"This film is mildly recommended.We need to talk about We Need to Talk About Kevin, my last film entry of this past year's films, a film that while not totally successfully still has merit due to the superb acting by Tilda Swinton and its compelling premise. ( The new 2012 movie season will begin with my upcoming review of one of the most notorious financial bombs ever, the sci-fi flix, John Carter. But more on that at a later time. )Let's now focus on this disturbing independent film. We Need to Talk About Kevin takes the oft-told debate of nature vs. nurture, playing with the possibility that one can spawn the next Anti-Christ or Damien without all the supernatural trimmings. Yes, it's hell on earth for Eva ( Tilda Swinton ), a free-spirited life-affirming young woman prior to motherhood whose life slowly unravels after giving birth to an unwanted Kevin. It's hate at first sight and the young boy learns that lesson early in life. So his sole purpose on Earth is to torment Mommy Dearest anyway he can: playing one parent against the other ( the other parent played by a doting and loving John C. Reilly ), purposely soiling himself, destroying her property and state of being, saying hurtful and profane remarks. Cruelty reigns supreme when you are raising a sociopath.Tilda Swinton is a revelation. Her performance is nuanced and reserved as she plays Eva as victim emotionally and psychologically abused by her baby terrorist of a son. Somehow ignored by the Academy for a Best Actress Oscar, the actress skillfully exemplifies the emotional turmoil of a woman undone by her off-spring. This bad seed is played by three young actors in various stages of Kevin's life: Rock Duer, Jasper Newell, and the remarkable Ezra Miller as the teenage son. Miller creates a real monster of a character and his daily battles with Ms.Swinton as his mother are tension-filled and riveting, mostly due to these strong actors' performances. However, they are slightly let down by a meandering screenplay that becomes more and more illogical as the film progresses with much of the overdone Diane Arbus inspired townsfolk as caricatures. Add to that, the main character's actions remaining sketchy at best, with little exposition of their motivations explained. And the artsy direction doesn't really help matters. ￼￼ Director Lauren Ramsay relies too much on her visual style and never fleshes out the narrative structure of the story. She seems too preoccupied with composition, lighting, and the overuse of blood red as her motif. Her direction is too labored and self-conscious which interferes with the interesting plot and the family dysfunctional dynamics. Her film is choppily edited and as fragmented as Eva's mind and the script portrays its characters are mere pawns rather than fully developed creations. All the fussy film editing undermines the serious impact of the film. ( Does any modern day director ever tell a truly linear story from beginning to end anymore? Must it always be a series of flashbacks and flash-forwards ? Do today's directors think that moviegoer all suffer from Attention Deficit Disorder and can't handle a coherent storyline?)The film and its uneven structure remains as fractured and disoriented as its central characters. We Need to Talk About Kevin needed less visual excess and more ""talk"" about Kevin and his chilling abnormal behavior. That is the essential missing element in a film that could have been better.

I thought the point of this movie was exploring emotions that don't really have any words to express them, you just experience it via the visual medium of cinema. The disjointed editing style, the long pauses, Tilda Swinton's miserable face and acting and the anticipation of the big climax reveal all create a disturbingly good atmosphere. I've seen so-called disturbing movies where nothing happens (anti-climactic) and they end up disappointing but this one did it's job.The movie is about a bittersweet bond between a mother and a son - that's all you need to know.

49,SnakesOnAnAfricanPlain,We Need to Talk About Kevin (2011),4,19 February 2012,"They certainly did need to talk about Kevin. I'm fine with difficult subject matter and ambiguous storytelling. But this film just seemed lazy in its search for answers. Tilda Swinton plays a mother that is haunted by something in her past. Her son is in jail, the whole town hates her, and her husband is no longer around. No prizes for guessing what is going on here. She tries to live a normal life but the town just wont forget the past. She looks at her past to see how her son turned into such a monster. The film angered me by dong nothing of note. Swinton is a terrible mother, as she never seeks help for her son. I've seen kids misbehave, but this film takes it so far. It comes across as some cheap Hollywood horror film. There is no way a sane woman wouldn't reach out or get out. Even when her daughter's safety is put at risk, she does nothing. Then we have Reilly as the father. He believes nothing his wife says, which makes me question why they are married in the first place. Even when Kevin acts out in front of him he he does nothing. Swinton also lives in the worst town in the world. The people are so horrid, you'd probably want to massacre their offspring yourself. I understand the anger, but this entire town is filled with vicious human beings. I was able to connect with one character in this entire film, the boy in the wheelchair. Other than that, you have a film of unbelievable, stupid, and cruel people. The acting is great, and it's shot beautifully. I've already read up about the book which seems more cohesive, and the narrative obviously works better than it does in this film.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
50,RainDogJr,"Tilda Swinton, I applaud you",8,29 January 2012,"I didn't know what to expect from this picture. Knew more or less that it was about a killer, and I thought it was actually John C. Reilly the one who played the killer. So yes, I didn't know much about it. One thing is sure: I never expected such powerful and patient film about a woman whose life is basically destroyed. When I say patient I mean that this is a film that never rushes; it may be a slow one for those who didn't go for Gus Van Sant's take on the Columbine massacre from ELEPHANT. I recalled Van Sant's film (a masterpiece, if you ask me) for the obvious, but also for the shopping online detail (killers getting their stuff from the internet in both films). And here the murder thing is also just the denouement of some issues. Here the main thing is the story of a woman who is, simply, very unhappy with her life. The main theme is that. The narrative of the film allows us to see the woman Eva (Tilda Swinton) being unhappy in many facets of her life. Yes, there are some flashbacks to happier times (when she got together with John C. Reilly's character Franklin), but we never feel anything but sorrow for this woman. And I think that's the best thing about the film. The rest of it is complementary. Take the Franklin character; he does basically nothing. The character Kevin from the title (son of Eva and Franklin) is obviously important, yet I never was interested in him. I mean, his problem is something that you just know is there and won't change (the actor doesn't stands out, by the way). There's an element that you sort of think will bring changes (the birth of Kevin's sister), but it feels just as a decorative element. So like I said the best of the film is how it feels like a complete messy nightmare (it actually opens with the sequence of a dream) for Eve. From extremely hard times as a mother (WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN is definitely a strong take on this: the love of a mother) to dealing with dancing a******* from events of the past to events of the present; she will take many punches. I like to think in the song ""Indifference"" by Pearl Jam to illustrate this: ""I will make my way through one more day in hell how much difference does it make?"" Anyway, Swinton is simply amazing. It's definitely one of her very best works and she helps A LOT to makes of this a winner. It's an overlooked kind of film, which I wasn't going to watch, but that pleasantly surprised me. *Watched it today",We Need to Talk About Kevin
51,p-stepien,Troublesome failure,4,30 June 2012,"Eva Khatchadourian (Tilda Swinton) attempts to deal with troubled events of her past. Her son Kevin (astounding breakthrough performance by Ezra Miller) is in jail, locked up for a horrendous crime, while she herself is being ostracised by the community for the atrocities committed. The events are presented in countless retrospectives, which fling us in time from the moment of Kevin's conception through his childhood up until the tragic events, that seem in retrospect a foregone conclusion.The inspirational inventive construction of the movie with the past intertwining and adding layers of understanding underlines the technical, directional and conceptual brilliance of the movie. Flawless in this regard it also verges on the brink of perfection from the cast as Swinton, Miller as well as John C. Reilly (playing the husband and father) perform stellarly. All in all the packaging is sheer excellence and a great example of superb filmmaking, so the underlying question remains: So where did it all go wrong? The key problem with ""We Must Talk About Kevin"" stems from questions of integrity. After uncovering several layers it does seem like a pretty banal thriller about a devil-child parading around as a psychological analysis of a murderer's upbringing, thus severely hitting the credibility of a movie with severe artistic inclinations. The psychotic deranged Kevin comes off as pre-fabricated and pre-destined, much like a protagonist better fitting to movies like ""Rosemary's Baby"" or ""Omen"", than to a more cerebral take on the origins of murder, giving the story a resounding false note, which deducts from the experience. So despite touching a lot of emotional strings the distant awkwardness of Kevin's background lowers feasibility and hi-jacks it into ""Scream"" territory.The biggest glitch originates from the flimsy portrayal from the early years of Eva's motherhood. Issues are suggested, like Eva's persisting post-delivery depression and blaming Kevin for the end of her freedom, which result in ambiguity towards motherhood. Nonetheless filming shots of Eva getting frustrated by her baby crying is rather counterproductive - it's hard to find a parent out there, who at one time or another didn't have the urge to throw his endlessly screaming child out the window. May not be popular dinner conversation, but that is the reality of parenthood. From this occurrence we jump several years forward, where Kevin still uses diapers and persistently ignores his mother in an already defiant, almost psychotic, fashion. Only in a moment of weakness (due to sickness) does Kevin open up to his mother and shows her affection. Henceforth the overall credibility of the movie falters, where a five-eight year old with Damien-like eyes is cynical and scheming enough to pretend to have fun with his father, while throwing meaningful evil glances at his mother.Children psychology is all over the place and lacks some serious background research or at least further story exposure of the early years, but a child of that age is not developed enough to show such anti-social, psychotic behaviour, unless you are in horror-movie-land. I understand the relationship may have been dysfunctional, but the mental acuity given to a toddler is beyond reason. All in all the background story for Kevin's upbringing seems laboured and rushed, overly focused on 'the finished product' and his hateful, sadistic behaviour. Not enough is actually dedicated to causes, while the loving caring father figure seems counter-intuitive to Kevin ending up a cold and ruthless sociopath. All in all the whole story seems in slight contradiction with the premeditated 'bad seed' actions of the son, as in the ultimate break-down the imprisoned Kevin is unable to find reason behind his murderous activities, ergo suggesting that all he essentially wanted was his motherly love. Something that Eva willingly offers her son.Overall - despite the directional ingenuity evident on screen - Lynne Ramsay fails to acknowledge certain traits of film regarding presentation of reality. The director does attempt to portray the happenings as part of Eva's memories. But whereas in a book a careful selection of words make subjective perception indecisive, picture forces the viewer to accept the flashbacks of the mother as the factual occurrence. In order to instill uncertainty a counterpoint is necessary, be it different perspectives of third persons or even reenacting the same memory several times, but offering variations.Essentially the movie aims to invoke questions about the causality of sociopathic behaviour. Is it a 'bad seed' or a question of breeding? Eva's ambivalence towards her maternity is suggested as a potential key reason, however this is indecisive due to how early in life Kevin is presented as disturbed and unsettled.The movie would have also benefited from actually delivering on the film's title and talking about Kevin. Instead we are filled with an overdose of long shots, gazes and supposedly self-explanatory sequences. All in all a disappointing experience given the immense promise of the underlying concept, which result in a soulless journey. Shame someone didn't do their homework and just took ill-advised ""Psycho"" short-cuts.That said - if it didn't pretend to be cerebral and meaningful, it would have gotten excellent grades from me as a straight-out thriller.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
52,pc95,Effectively Disturbing,7,23 June 2012,"One of the more disturbing movies I've seen in quite awhile, Lynne Ramsay's ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is an unsettling and grotesque watch. The experience of it wears you down and leaves you dismayed over it's runtime. (spoilers) The character Kevin Kachadorian (sp?) has pulled the wool over most everyone's eyes except the one he hates and/or loves the most in his life: his mother (played by Tilda Swanson). Cleverly Ramsay never makes it really clear which one it is even up until the closing credits. Tilda Swanson's character is left in the same bewildered agony as the audience. This is the right decision for the ending too, leaving confusion and adding to the affect. The director employs a jig-saw puzzle narrative effectively enough and (spoiler) I thought that the scenes and acting of the earlier younger Kevin were actually more disturbing than the violence. The only annoying parts of the movie were: 1) several of the soundtrack choices, whichwere out of place, and goofy for the content of the material. Leave montage music for some other lighter genre - this isn't television. And 2)The character of the Dad who seems to be completely doosped unbelievably, and treats his Wife like an idiot. Anyway, still this is a well made movie that hits the mark, and leaves you disconcerted. Recommended, but be ready.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
53,bandw,"Excellent performances, stylish presentation, some plot holes",7,29 July 2013,"(Spoilers) This story is presented as a patchwork of scenes spaced over a period of about twenty years. Things come into focus only gradually and it is not until the end that there is a sense of the complete story being told. And that story is about an internecine struggle between a mother and son. Adults can sometimes take it upon themselves to make life miserable for a particular person, but here we have a child who is on a crusade to break his mother emotionally almost from the moment of his birth.Eva, the mother, is played by Tilda Swinton and she is not blameless in creating the dysfunction between her and her son Kevin. Eva was an adventurous free spirit until she met Franklin (John C. Reilly), married, and had Kevin (Ezra Miller). Swinton portrays postpartum depression with agonizing precision. It goes beyond that, it's clear that she did not want to have this child. That is clear to Kevin as well--in spite of all of the ""I love you""s a parent my issue, a child can tell whether he is loved. Sensing an undercurrent of rejection, Kevin's response is to make Eva pay. Franklin makes the situation worse by being almost clueless as to what is going on; his approach to parenting is to view Kevin as his buddy.In an ultimate attempt to break Eva Kevin goes on a killing spree at his high school. After the many school shootings that the United States has suffered in the last decade, the one question that never seems to have a satisfactory answer is, ""Why?"" The way things develop in this movie, you understand how things have gotten so out of control.After the event Eva is totally ostracized by her community as if she were the one who did the killings. It puzzled me why Eva lost everything and wound up living in a small lower-class house, begging for a clerk's job in a travel agency. I would think that there might be some sympathy expressed for this woman who had such a horrible thing happen in her family. Other things did not ring true to me. When people throw red paint on Eva's house, she tries to sand it off with an orbital sander. Why that rather than simply painting over it? How did Kevin effect so many killings with a bow and arrow without being taken down? At first I wondered why Eva did not move as far away as possible and start life anew. Maybe out of guilt, or as penance, she stubbornly tries to break down the wall of antipathy between her and Kevin. This resulted in a final scene that I found satisfying.All of the actors are up to the task. The boys who play Kevin at various ages are excellent. I hope that the attitudes they so skillfully portray here do not carry over into their real lives as learned behavior.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

58,mossgrymk,need to talk about kev,8,24 October 2020,"Scrolling through the last twenty reviews or so I can see that this film is your typical love it or hate it deal. Well, I'm certainly not in the later camp and am a bit shy of the former. (Call it a strong feeling of ""like"".) There is, after all, a ludicrousness at the core of this wacko mixture of ""Bad Seed"" and ""Ordinary Peopled"", namely why someone as intelligent and perceptive as the character played by Tilda Swinton would not do what the film's title suggests and, at some point, (maybe between willfully fouling oneself in one's own waste and putting out little sis' eyeball) consult a FREAKIN SHRINK!!! That this gaping question was largely kept at bay by me (I believe the academics call it ""willing suspension of disbelief"") is due, of course, to the directorial skills of Lynne Ramsey and the acting chops of Ms. Swinton and the two incarnations of the title character, played by Ezra Miller and Jasper Newell. In other words, once you're hooked you're hooked and I confess that this film grabbed me from the moment Swinton's character goes from youthful exuberance to post traumatic horror, neatly tied together with the visual of blood red. So, even though it never quite convinced me that the cold, distant mom is as much to blame as the colder, more distant son and the dad is clueless to the point of caricature I would watch this film again, if not in an instant, maybe sometime in the not so distant future.

59,napierslogs,We could talk about Kevin but nobody knows what to say,6,24 March 2012,"""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is about a young boy who is exhibiting some pretty serious behavioural problems and then as a teenager is most likely responsible for some pretty heinous actions. It's also about his mother. The recent excellent film ""Beautiful Boy"" (2010) follows similar relationships but takes the stance that it isn't always the fault of the parents. This film seems to say to forget about that morality tale, it is the mother's fault.This film would probably have been excellent if we really did talk about Kevin, as in have discussions, aka dialogue. Instead we spent an awful lot of time zooming in on his eyeball. And his mother's eyeball. Every other scene also needed to have something or someone covered in red. Be it blood, paint, jam, spaghetti sauce or ketchup, this film was soaked in red. To me, the avant-garde style of filmmaking detracted from the story they were trying to tell.I'm also not sure I agree with what they were trying to say. But that can be a positive if they leave you with things to think about. Which they do – in spades.Kevin is a complex fellow and we never can be sure why he does the things he does. I have come up with some explanations for some of his actions but no definitive answer to ""Why?"" Part of that is because it's a good way to structure a film, but it also leads to another problem.We start spending time with Kevin when he's a toddler. Apparently he's three but with the emotional and mental acuity of a twenty-something cynical adult. The young Rock Duer that played him was excellent but the writing for that character was far from believable. The teenage Kevin played by Ezra Miller was more appropriate and just as well portrayed. Behaving the way teenagers do but with this anger from years of mental derangement brooding beneath the surface. Ezra Miller has this tenderness to everything he does that instead of being scared of him we start feeling sorry for him.I, however, felt sorry for him from the beginning. I don't think people like Tilda Swinton's character should ever be allowed to be a mother. At least John C. Reilly grew into the role of a father. They were hippies that conceived their son while participating in some weird foreign spiritual ritual that involves being bathed in gallons and gallons of blood (I'm assuming animal blood and guts) along with hundreds of other people.

The film shows her current story while also showing the life of her son in flashback beginning with his infancy when he was always a problem child despite his parents' best efforts.Director Lynne Ramsay is successful in using many interesting techniques in storytelling especially when time changes take place. The trouble is the story itself. It is certainly not flawed; it's just very difficult and uncomfortable. These stories are certainly worthy of being told but if there is little or no redeeming value or understanding by the end, it's difficult to believe the discomfort was worth the trouble - especially in some early scenes when someone is wrongly persecuted for being made guilty by association. - dbamateurcritic",We Need to Talk About Kevin

It never felt like a pointless decision to intercut between present-day and the past, because the protagonist's entire life is now impacted by that one event, so it's natural for her to be reliving it constantly in her mind. Tilda Swinton was absolutely brilliant in the film, and you could easily sympathize with her. All the actors they got to play Kevin did wonderful, and I found the casting to be spot on because they all could deliver a similar performance and looked alike.It's hard to evaluate the quality of We Need to Talk About Kevin because it was both powerful, but also gut-wrenching. It's not enjoyable to watch in any fashion, and I think it would be remarkably triggering for some people. For once I can say, thank goodness I have no children of my own, because I can only imagine how much worse this would be for parents. I do think it tackled the topic well, and did it in a way that didn't take any political sides, which could be a real danger with this topic. I'm sure not every kid in this situation has the same mental issues that Kevin was dealing with, but I didn't mind him as an extreme example. I did my best to write up this entire review without touching on any spoilers, but We Need to Talk About Kevin is the kind of movie that I could see some people really struggling with, so I do wonder if you should read up on the subject matter before diving in. Either way, it's an excellently-made film that I'll probably never watch again.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
62,reddiemurf81,"I would turn back now if I were you,,,",6,5 May 2020,"Where do I start?!?First off,, Tilda Swinton and Ezra Miller should've been nominated (if not won) some awards for their performances,,, oh my,,, Reilly was good as well, but always is.This is one of the more uncomfortable movies I've ever sat through. Eva (Swinton) is an adventurous woman who becomes pregnant, and must put her dreams of travel on hold when she gives birth to Kevin. From the moment he is born, Eva struggles to bond with him, and as he grows into a toddler,,
tell-tale signs start to show that Kevin is,,, well, not happy. To be blunt, he is just downright horrible to his Mom,, but turns on his sweet, happy demeanor when Dad comes home (Kevin is super manipulative,,, from the get go). Kevin never has a nice thing to say to his mother, and always has this scowl when looking her direction,,, some people today might have a special title for that,, but I call it needing a whoopin' everyday til you get straightened out,,, ugh
Anyways,, when Kevin becomes a teen (Ezra Miller) he continues to show signs of 0 empathy, 0 love,,, not even towards his little sister (whom he hurts during several parts of the movie),,, and I know that teenagers can be vicious,,, but Kevin is on another level.
Anyways,, I'm ranting here,,, the Dad is still in denial that there's anything wrong (understandable,, I mean no one would want to admit their child is psychotic,,, but still you can't just ignore signs) with Kevin or how he acts,, and things continue to spiral,,,This is the 2nd movie I've seen from this director,, and I like how she told this story.I cannot give this a higher rating bc it's just so uncomfortable and dark. Am I glad I finally watched it? Yes! The acting was amazing!! Will I ever watch it again? Not unless I go back to watch a few scenes (just to see how good Miller was at playing psychotic).",We Need to Talk About Kevin
63,MrGKB,"Unsettling, unsparing, and somewhat unsatisfying...",7,19 July 2012,"...""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is primarily a showcase for the exceptional talents of Tilda ""Orlando"" Swinton and a breakout performance by Ezra ""Californication"" Miller in a somewhat artsy examination (based on a much more satisfying novel) of the age-old nature versus nurture dichotomy of child rearing. It's a noble attempt, and surely a feather in the cap of long-dormant Brit auteur, Lynne ""Ratcatcher"" Ramsay, but the transition from page to screen can't quite capture the nuances of the source material. Despite the bravura cast, fine lensing by Seamus ""The Avengers"" McGarvey, an apt score from Radiohead guitarist, Jonny ""There Will Be Blood"" Greenwood, and all around production values that make full use of a pared down budget, ""...Kevin"" can only substitute an artful highlight reel of events (presented mostly in flashback) for the densely-written proceedings of an epistolary novel. As a result, much of the complexity of the protagonist/antagonist relationship is lost, as well as those between the mother and her husband and daughter. Much as most film adaptations of Stephen King's work suffer from the loss of internal monologues and interior storytelling, so too with ""...Kevin."" I'm unsurprised that it was a box office dud; the subject matter is old hat in this day and age, and ""...Kevin"" doesn't have the supernatural hook of forebearers like ""Rosemary's Baby"" or ""The Omen,"" or even the once-upon-a-time shock value of ""The Bad Seed."" School massacres have devolved into dime-a-dozen headlines that fade faster than it takes to bring the perps to trial, and of course in these post-WTC/Internet beheadings/Norway/Aurora massacre times, the travails of a reluctant mother and her murderous offspring apparently don't really draw a lot of sympathy or interest.Nonetheless, Swinton fits her role to a tee, as does Miller, and the two younger versions of Kevin are pretty impressive as well. John C. ""Casualties of War"" Reilly fills in as the hornswoggled dad; even if the role is vastly reduced from the book, he does what he can and does it well. Altogether, there's still much to like about it, and it's well worth a watch, if only to enjoy the nervous thrill of feeling ""there but for the grace of God go I.""",We Need to Talk About Kevin

Lynne Ramsey succeeds where so many others dealing with a similar subject matter have failed, as she abstains from sensationalism and bloody detail. Instead she focuses in on character and relationship development and breakdown.Tilda Swinton gives a truly great performance and even though the main thread of the story is clear almost from the start, she and the rest of the terrific cast manage to keep the viewer glued to the screen.One of the most interesting facets of the film was that it showed how much power children can hold and execute over adults if they are given the opportunity.We need to talk about Kevin is quality from start to finish and deserves to become a classic.

66,joebloggscity,One dark disturbing movie.,8,6 January 2012,"This is a film with a tough premise especially in light of events over the past twenty years in the US and recently in Norway. The film lets it known that this is the central act of the film so there is nothing spoiled here. Difficult to watch but you will be kept entranced. Tilda Swinton gives a performance as a mother (Eva) with the most difficult son imaginable. She can't cope with the boy who seems to be as sharp as the adults. Nothing seems to be beyond him and he is always a step ahead. Eva is on her own as her loyal and loving husband doesn't understand or see the truth. This all culminates to mass tragedy. The film moves back and forth between the tragedy, after the tragedy, and mostly Kevin's upbringing as a toddler and then teenager. No CGI or anything required in this. It's quite a raw film, but the director uses lots of different scopes and shots to get us to feel unnerved as much as Eva has to endure. It's very well filmed and the acting from the central duo of Tilda Swinton and Ezra Miller are brilliant. I can't think of a more frightening performance or character than Ezra's portrayal of ""Kevin"" for a long time. Terrific.Word of warning, some might find it a little too unsettling. However, the film and book have never masked their subject and what you see is what you get. A dark and well adapted film which most will keep them glued to their seat.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
67,Vivekmaru45,Is A Mother To Be Blamed For The Actions Of Her Child?,6,2 September 2015,"An above average drama. The film is told in flashbacks through the eyes of a mother. As the film progresses these flashbacks reveal more and more of the unfolding tragedy that has occurred.Directed by Lynne Ramsay and adapted from Lionel Shriver's novel of the same name, the film is about a mother(played by Tilda Swinton) struggling to come to terms with her son(played by Ezra Miller) and the crime he has committed.Plot in brief: Throughout his life, Kevin has been detached and difficult. Eva had problems with identifying as a mother and has trouble bonding with Kevin, which affects his behavior. As a baby, he cries incessantly; and, as a child, he resists toilet training, rebuffs Eva's clumsy attempts at affection, and shows no interest in anything. While he is still small, Eva's frustration with his intractability drives her to throw Kevin against the wall, breaking his arm. They return from the hospital with Kevin's arm in a cast; and, when his father, Franklin (John C. Reilly), asks how he broke his arm, Kevin covers for his mother with a lie, using this incident later to subtly blackmail her into giving in to demands, like skipping her errands to take him straight home after school. When Eva tries to talk to her husband about her increasing concern about Kevin's problems, he dismisses her concerns and makes excuses for Kevin's behavior. The only real affection and interest Kevin shows towards Eva occurs when he is confined to his bed with a fever and she reads him a book about Robin Hood. When reading the part of the story where Robin competes in Prince John's archery contest, Kevin snuggles with Eva and spurns Franklin when he interrupts the story. Franklin gives him a bow and arrow set and teaches him archery, and Kevin soon becomes an excellent marksman. He continues to practice and graduate to bigger bows as he gets older.Watch the film to find out what happens next...Verdict: The film explores the relationship between a mother and her first child, who is strangely unemotional and of a reclusive character. Typically you would brand him an antisocial child in today's society, as well as highly dependent on his parents.It is cruel I know for a child to be an outcast among his peers. I myself have suffered this, but I have slowly recovered from this mindset. However some scars remain and will not be erased. Eventually Kevin's alienation lashes out into violence as we see during the climax of the film.More films to watch: Jeffrey Dahmer: The Secret Life 1993, The Good Son (1993), The Bad Seed (1985), Child of Rage (TV Movie 1992), Elephant (2003).Thanks for reading.

70,witster18,"Strong performances, unbelievable tale...",5,30 July 2012,"My thinking is that if you have a ""difficult kid"", you either fix it through discipline and love, or it's something unfix-able(autism/serious mental health issues). And the weird thing about this one is that they try to make Kevin the new Omen, or the new ""evil"" and not the mentally disturbed kid that he is. It's unrealistic because the film does nothing to substantiate the paranormal vibe that they try to give the character.The story/director here is hovering a middle ground that may not exist, or at least doesn't come off as realistic.When it gets to the point that you're scared of YOUR child - it's time to seek professional help.I just found Tilda's character of ""Eva"" to be so gutless and cowardly. It's pretty hard to sympathize with her because of it.I rather liked the way the film introduced the tragedy. It was subtle. It takes a while for the audience to piece together what's unfolding - so the film does sort of pull you in. BUT, we needed to know the pre-Kevin Eva. It's really hard to justify, or in this case, ""criticize"" her actions when we really don't know her.The film excels with some early style points and has fine acting, but is brought back down with callus and unlikable characters to which the audience cannot connect. The film does a great job of showing us what Eva is like after the birth of Kevin. We know what Kevin has done to her life, but we STILL don't know who Eva is. It would have made it overlong, but I think the film really would have benefited from a little more set-up in a flashback or something. We got flashback, but there's far too little to accomplish what I'm talking about.Worth a single viewing at a rental price, but a little overrated here at 7.6.Try ""Julia"" instead. A stronger and more believable performance from Swinton in that one, and a little bit better of a movie to boot.You might like this if you liked: Julia(slightly better), Elephant(slightly better), The Good Son(worse), or Trade(about even).",We Need to Talk About Kevin

73,Neptune165,This movie sticks to you for days,8,10 August 2019,"The kid pure creeped me out. His bond with his father is only an act to humiliate his mother This film gives justice to the sentiment of a sociopath. And that's what he is. when she broke his arm. He broke his sister mentally, he made her dislike herself fundamentally, she would have grown up broken. He blinded her for fun. The whole film we're shown how much he does to his mother, He has a disconnect from reality. One of the things that really aren't fleshed out in the movie is the role of the dad. In the book, I hated the guy. He never believed his wife when she told him things about Kevin, he always took Kevin's word over hers, he always let Kevin get away with things. It is depicted in the film in a small way, but the book really brought this to light and his attitude annoyed me so much. Didn't find it uncomfortable to watch at all. I found the way it all unfolded to be fantastic, but unfortunately it's one of those movies that you'll never get that same, amazing, experience again from it after you've seen it. I'm sure I'd enjoy it.. This film Didn't find it uncomfortable to watch at all. I found the way it all unfolded to be fantastic, but unfortunately it's one of those movies that you'll never get that same, amazing, experience again from it after you've seen it. I'm sure I'd enjoy it, but the way it unfolded, the mystery, the buildup, the questions (where is Kevin? Where is the father? Where is the daughter? Did they book town? Are any of them dead? Why does she insist on staying there? were so excellently slowly unraveled in this awesome, dreamlike fashion. Really made you feel like the main character being haunted by the memories and confronting them while at the same time trying her best to put them behind her. But the best parts, in my opinion, were the little things. The scene with the kid in the wheel chair who seems to understand that she is a victim in all this too. Perhaps even more than himself. The woman who slaps her across the face. The kids on Halloween surrounding her house. The mini-golf scene ""wonder where I get it from..."". The ""I am the context"" scene. The silent shots of them sitting across from each other, presumably, for almost two years straight, saying nothing. The way he fingered his scar from when he was a child, might as well just be pointing his finger right at her and saying ""IT'S YOU! YOU ARE THE PROBLEM! YOU CAUSED ALL OF THIS!"". And, especially, the scene when he is finally asked why. Why did he do this. And his answer. Absolute perfection.Amazingly. Personally, I think Kevin is a sociopath. From a very young age, even before he could say a word, he showed no emotion towards his mother and manipulated his father. From my point of view, this movie shows how a woman who didn't want a kid in the first place (wanted to travel and live her life free) was not only forced in having that suburban life she never wanted, but the light that could have been her son was in fact a burning fire. He showed no affection and no wish to create bond with her on top of being extremely destructive to what she likes most. which ends up being passed to her child both biologically and environmentally. She felt more and more alone and Kevin also wanted her to be alone, to be his private toy. well made movie and well told story. One of the greats.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
74,RJBurke1942,Where we see the worst in a child or child rearing?,9,2 February 2013,"Thematically, this is a viscerally rewarding story about the debate surrounding the nature-nuture issue in child rearing. In short, when a young person goes off the rails, do you blame the parents or child – or both? Tilda Swinton gives a riveting performance as a mother (Eva) unable to cope with and understand her first born, (Kevin), played by Rock Duer when toddler, later by Ezra Miller when teenager – both of whom matched the quality of Swinton's acting. John C. Reilly is the dad (Franklin) who just doesn't see the faults that Kevin displays from birth almost. His performance is low-key, somewhat remote, busy in his work, being the business man he is. The second child, a daughter (Celia) played by Ashley Gerasimovich, is a useful addition with which to ratchet up the tension within the family.Hence, we see what happens through Eva's eyes for 90% of the movie which is presented in multiple flashbacks – and which sometimes is difficult to follow, at least for me. That aside, it's well-produced and photographed, showing what Eva is doing after the family is ruined by what Kevin did. What's particularly well done is the gradual revelation of the extent to which Kevin is socially and mentally disturbed – all done with subtle but vicious exchanges between Kevin and Eva which inexorably get worse, and which fosters mounting suspense about: what will Kevin do next? Well, watch for the sequence about what Kevin does to Celia's pet hamster.Having failed to finish the novel some years back (I didn't like the structure), I was content to see the movie finally. The final horrific act by Kevin is filmed so that most is in the viewer's head; only the aftermath is explicit which, for me, is a more effective technique to show what had happened.The ending is fitting but leaves a small window of hope for Eva. But the question then is why? You can come to your own assessment.This is not a movie for kids, or those under 18, I guess, with an R rating. All parents should see it, though, no question.Give this nine out of ten.February 3, 2013",We Need to Talk About Kevin
75,Likes_Ninjas90,The centrepiece of the film and why the rivalry is so accomplished is due to the dominance of Swinton's troubled performance,8,17 November 2011,"A woman named Eva (Tilda Swinton) wakes up dislocated from her life. The outside of her house is covered in red paint. She is alone but tries to reassemble her life by applying for a job in an office. Everyone is interested in watching her but we are unsure why. Flashing back to an earlier time period and we see Eva living with her husband Franklin (John C. Reilly). They raise a child named Kevin but she struggles to cope with the baby. Over the years she forms a rivalry with her son Kevin because they have no understanding of each other's space. He grows up to become a problem child with little compassion and only a slightly stronger bond with his father. Their lives are further complicated by the arrival of their second child Lucy (Ursula Parker), who at one point loses one of her eyes. Cutting in between the two timelines is a tragic event that Eva keeps remembering and returning to. This chilling adaptation of Lionel Shriver's novel succeeds in projecting two separate but common periods of isolation. The first is the most familiar to us. It is the conflict between an adult and a child's perspective of the world. A normal mother like Eva holds an expectation for her child to be obedient, while Kevin deliberately questions why at every opportunity, through his rebellious behaviour. It is rare that either character finds a cooperative middle ground. The rivalry between Eva and Kevin is fascinating to watch because their relationship shifts regularly between attention seeking and the need for separation and independence. Meanwhile, the present day scenes reveal that in the absence of children, parental instincts still remain and can develop into a deep case of paranoia. It forces a parent to always question the people and places in their vicinity. This is reflected through Lynne Ramsay's formal sophistication, a quality seen all too rarely in films this year and one that gives the story texture and immediacy. Images in the film, such as the paint thrown over the house, or Kevin's chomping jaw, are tightly framed. The diegetic sounds of objects in the film, such as the rumbling of a sander, are amplified to deafening levels. The sound and visuals combine to characterise a deeply claustrophobic world, where a parent's caution of people and spaces separates them from normality. While the theme of isolation is carried between both timelines, the non-linear narrative frames the story like a mystery. The film is cleverly told because it understands how to build tension through its structure. Events in the present are selective but then revealed slowly through flashbacks. At one point Lucy is shown with an eye patch and then the film moves back in time, building up to what happened to her. Similarly, a woman slaps Eva in the face and it is over the course of the entire film that we learn why, with mesmerising results. These time shifts are deliberately disorientating, revealing Eva's disconnection from the present day. We're constantly trying to determine how we reached this emotional crisis point. The shifts also threaten to derail our understanding of the story but the film smartly settles into a more cohesive rhythm. Whether you know the eventual outcomes of the narrative from the novel or not, the events are told with a foreboding sense of dread. The centrepiece of the film and why the rivalry is so accomplished is due to the dominance of Swinton's troubled performance. She inspires one of the most hauntingly effectively roles this year. Her physical attributes are an asset to her work. She already has a thin, hollow face and through the grim close-up shots she is able to express her inner- most torment. The intensity in her body language too, along with the icy delivery of her lines, reveals a frustrated woman, deeply bitter at having her life disrupted by her child. Featuring in nearly every scene, a Best Actress nomination early next year is highly likely. Ezra Miller as the older Kevin is almost effortless in creating an equally cold character and one that we find compassionless and easy to hate. Kevin is a highly ambiguous character though and he represents a void that the screenplay can never fulfil. The questions surrounding his psychology are deliberately unanswered but it also begs for more clues to be left behind. At its most simplistic, the film suggests that he holds a desire for attention. Following one of the film's major climaxes, Kevin postures in front of people as though he is a celebrity being cheered upon. Yet this is at odds with an earlier scene where he wrecks Eva's computer. She asks him why he does it and he replies: ""There is no point. That's the point"". With more hints his psychology might have been more conclusive and satisfying. Warmer support is provided by John C. Reilly. Predictably, he has a few clever comic moments but also a much tighter relationship with Kevin. Their bond makes the very moving climax all the more challenging to understand. It suggests that sometimes even the closest parents will have trouble understanding why.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
76,Christian_Dimartino,I would say you do.,10,24 July 2012,"Tilda Swinton is a gifted actress, but i'm sure that's old news. It's a shame that her latest film, We Need To Talk About Kevin, was so notoriously overlooked. i would be putting it on my list of the best movies of 2011, but Roger Ebert didn't, and is putting it on his 2012 list, so I will too.The film revolves around a woman, played by Swinton, who is trying to adjust to life after her son (the older version is played by an incredibly creepy but terrific young actor named Ezra Miller) has made it a living hell. They haven't gotten along since he was a baby, and have been playing head games with each other since.WNTTAK is an excellent movie that makes The Good Son look like Norbit. Sure that kid is a little more evil... no, i'm probably wrong about that. I forgot to mention John C. Reilly, who plays Swinton's clueless husband. He is also really good. You will have a hard time tearing your eyes away from this film. It's engrossing, at times chilling, and unique, and acted to perfection.The most interesting moments are between Swinton and her son, both young and old. They hate each other, its obvious. He uses tricks to fool his naiive father, while his mom knows what he's doing, he she doesn't buy it. Swinton does her best work yet here, as an unfortunate woman who must regret ever giving birth to his monster.Miller is a promising young talent that I definitely hope to see more of. It's a good thing that his career started with this film, because this will look impressive on his resume.

79,asda-man,You will be talking about Kevin!,9,4 March 2012,"""We Need To Talk About Kevin"" is an extremely memorable and brave film that isn't shy to shock and pack a punch. It's a wonderful film to end with a trip to Barrow Panto, as it provides a balance of hilarity (Barrow panto) and sombre sadness (Kevin). I haven't read the novel but I would imagine that the film brilliantly transfers the chilling atmosphere from the page to the screen seamlessly.The film contains some of the best and inspiring directing I've seen. It's an art-house film of sorts so expect lots of brilliant symbolism and metaphors to feed the Bodger inside you. The film is split up into two halves that often flip between themselves. One half concerns Eva and Kevin's relationship as he grows up and the other follows Eva and the consequences for Kevin's actions. The latter projects a tremendous sense of alienation and creates a brilliant enigma that leaves us wondering ""What the heck has Kevin done?"" and why is Eva now like this. One fantastic moment is on Halloween when some annoying kids come to her door dressed in masks, but she panics because she doesn't have any ""treats"" to offer them so she turns the lights out, but the kids still see her and so she sinks into the tinted shadow of the children banging on the window. It beautifully portrays Eva's deterioration and is a memorably intense moment.The half with Kevin growing up is equally as compelling. Eva's character is such a complex and interesting one to look at, maybe even more so than Kevin's. Was Kevin born evil? Or did Eva make him this way? There is no clear answer, but it provides a great debate. Sound is used especially well during Kevin's baby years. A brilliant scene is where Eva finds Kevin's crying so intense that she has to stop and find peace at a noisy building site. It's heart-breaking, and a great deal of sympathy for Eva is certainly given. The directing is also very placid and cold towards Kevin which brilliantly mimics his psychotic personality.Tilda Swinton's performance also must be congratulated. I think that it's Oscar-winning stuff (of Meryl wasn't up as well) and the fact that she didn't even get nominated is a puzzler to me. Tilda provides a great deal of humanity and the chilling atmosphere between her and Kevin could be sliced with a knife. Ezra Miller is also wonderfully chilling as Kevin and also has a great psychotic look (no offence Ezra). I also thought that the toddler version of Kevin was suitably annoying and well-acted. The only actor I didn't feel that fit was John C. Reilly who confirms that he only really has a place in comedy. He just felt miscast and didn't leave an impression as great as Tilda's or Kevin's.The cinematography is also fantastic from the surreal tomato-fest to the supermarket, to the haunting shot of Kevin towards the end, it was brilliant. There was a clear sophisticated and chilling atmosphere that lasted throughout. I also found that it ended perfectly and not too openly. I found it absorbing and also affecting. ""We Need To Talk About Kevin"" is a film that definitely deserves more recognition than it receives. Critics shower the film with 5 stars, yet audiences seem to block it out! I also think that it should've had a heap of Oscar nominations ranging from Best Actress to Best Cinematography, but I suppose because of its controversial nature, they felt it wouldn't be appropriate, maybe?Anywho, I loved ""We Need To Talk About Kevin"" it is an absorbing and affecting experience that left me overwhelmed. It's one of those films that leave a deep imprint on you and it isn't easy to forget. The directing, acting, cinematography, screenplay, sound and music are all wonderful and above-par (no pun intended) than most films. I think that it was one of the best films of 2011 (obviously I can't officially say that because I haven't seen all of them!) and it excelled and excited beautifully. It's a film I'm not likely to forget and nor want to.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
80,phenomynouss,driven too much by stupid,5,1 August 2021,"I got this film; it didn't escape me in any way. I wasn't left confused. I rather like the lack of chronology in the scenes, and they weren't hard to keep track of at all.As well, I get the whole moody, ""artistic"" vibe that it is going for, and that such a vibe necessitates some people behaving at best, foolishly, and at worst, really stupid. What's unfortunate in this film is that too much of it required people being very very stupid in order for it to work.Right from the beginning as a toddler, Kevin is played up at the full 11 on a 1-10 Psychopath scale, radiating ""Satanic Demon Spawn"" right from the get-go with his leering Kubrick Stares and sophisticated vocabulary at a disturbingly early age.He is outright abusive toward his mother, Eva, and she does nothing. Not only does she do nothing about this, she does not communicate this at all to her husband Franklin. We get too many repetitive scenes of Kevin doing something pure evil, riling up Eva, then Franklin arriving and Kevin reverting back to innocent baby mode, leaving him not believing her when she insists he's acting crazy.But she doesn't play this up either. This isn't a clear cut case of ""Child is clearly the spawn of Satan and mother is on to him"". Tilda Swinton's Eva is played with a very clear and careful balance of a mother wondering if she is doing something wrong or if the child is just rotten to the core.The problem is the film doesn't reflect this attitude at all; the child is rotten, no misunderstanding or excuses. He's almost supernaturally evil in some scenes, it's literally laughable, and often goes beyond the realm of ""laughing because it's weird and uncomfortable"" and into ""laughing because it's ridiculous and stupid"". As in, there are certain scenes where you burst out laughing at Kevin's misbehavior while recognizing it is unsettling and possibly dangerous, and other times you burst out laughing because it's cartoonish and being played deadly serious.Kevin seems to only get worse as he gets older, as at least as a child he puts on the facade of an innocent boy around his father. By the time he's a teenager, he is languishing around the house mumbling and snarking with vicious barbs and insults like he was raised entirely on Marilyn Manson, showing absolutely nothing resembling care for anyone, even his little sister after she loses an eye, seeming to go out of the way to mock her maiming right in front of his parents.If Kevin puts up a facade of innocence or normality while around others or in school, we never see it, or even hear it mentioned at all. He's a perpetually leering, smirking creep every time we see him in public with his mother, and it leaves no room for interpretation as to whether he is a closeted psychopath or not. He's a few beats away from shrieking and waving a knife around in public while masturbating with his free hand.And all throughout, Eva does nothing. Franklin does nothing. They are essentially in a completely different film from Kevin, and it slowly becomes frustrating as you see these stupid, stupid people go on behaving stupidly until their Demon Child ends up doing something atrocious.By such a point, it's not even a surprise that it happened, it's just a surprise that it took so long and that literally no one in school or in his family saw it coming or did anything about it.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
81,christophe92300,Disturbing,9,16 October 2012,"WNTTAK is a fascinating, disturbing movie that immerses the viewer in the troubled relationship between a mother and her son.The script is dense, deep, unfolds smoothly and makes you question yourself about a lot of matters.The actors are perfect in their roles and convey lots of emotions.

82,andrewroy-04316,"A tense movie, unflinching in tone",8,17 July 2018,"We Need To Talk About Kevin was extremely impressive, especially given the very challenging nature of adapting its source material. While the book had great thematic elements, the tone and style were not gripping and kept it from being a really atmospheric tale. Ramsay blows it out of the water by using nonlinear time effectively and delivering emotion and intensity in each scene. I think what made this a great movie for me was: even though I had read the book and knew what happened, I couldn't check out or look away for any scene, because each detail of each scene was meticulously designed and had nuance to it. Swinton does deliver an exceptional, subtle performance in the lead, and though it threw me off at first, I love Ramsay's minute changes to Kevin's character, which make him seem much more realistic as a child and not just a possessed, purely evil child from birth. Many of the larger questions asked by this film are implied, not explicitly stated. I also liked the waiting for the reveal of what Kevin actually did, rather than stating it early on without suspense as the book did. This is a great movie with tension in each scene.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

Wonder how much truth there is with the school shooters. But only the Conn. kid killed his mom first.

85,samkan,Most Disappointing,6,15 April 2012,"I was pumped up for this film based on a NY Times review which suggested in particular, the effect of mom's bringdown from a world traveler to an ordinary mom as being a potential cause of her son's malevolence. Looking for such, I just didn't see it. Nor did I find it suspenseful or insightful. The opening scene was compelling and for maybe a half hour I was excited and apprehensive about what might come. But the next 80+ minutes provides - in a nutshell - two miserable people glaring at one another. Its very easy to understand what the maker WANTED to pull off and for such reason WNTTAK doesn't deserve the one star comments herein. Again, for me it was ""Zombie v. Zombie"".My 15 year old son is developing a sophisticated appreciation of film; e.g., enjoying MARTHA MARCY MARLENE, A SEPARATION, MARGIN CALL, etc. Halfway through the movie he whispered to me, ""He's going to kill people with his bow and arrows."" The split second we see that Kevin purchased heavy-duty bolts my son whispered, ""He's going to lock-down his school,"" On the way out of this one he remarked, ""How come its not until the end that Kevin says something nice?"" I think my boy was suggesting Kevin's ""I used to think I knew. Now I'm not so sure."" as entirely inconsistent with the Kevin we were given. I rest my case.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
86,cat_ranchero,Excellent!... Well worth a look!...,9,29 June 2012,"Very well made with a really good soundtrack mostly made up of popular songs which sometimes match and sometimes contradict the on-screen action Nicely done (IMO). There are two stand-out performances; Tilda Swinton is totally brilliant as Eva, she really deserved more recognition for her part here. Also worthy of praise was Ezra Miller as the brooding, menacing teenage Kevin; he gave an outstanding performance. Honourable mentions go to; John C. Reilly as Franklin, Jasper Newell as Kevin, 6-8 years, Rock Duer as Kevin, Toddler and Ashley Gerasimovich as Celia.I know that one performance (or in this case two performances) doesn't make a film; however, there is much more to this than first meets the eye. First of all there's the mystery of why everyone hates Eva; there is some really subtle imagery on show and the use sparing of dialogue gives the audience a sense of the isolation that Eva must feel. I really don't want to say too much, I came into it knowing very little and I think that's the best way to see this film. I will watch it again at some point and I'll probably see even more. This, somewhat controversial, film is well worth a look if you get the chance HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My score: 9.3/10IMDb Score: 7.6/10 (based on 25,815 votes at the time of going to press).MetaScore: 68/100: (Based on 37 critic reviews provided by Metacritic.com at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Tomatometer' Score: 76/100 (based on 145 reviews counted at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes 'Audience' Score: 80/100 'Liked It' (based on 25,912 user ratings counted at the time of going to press).You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
87,Mike_Devine,Swinton can only do so much to salvage 'Kevin',5,27 August 2018,"Sometimes it can be risky when a film is tied so much to one actor or actress. We see this happen time and time again - where it will succeed or falter based on the leading person's performance. In 'We Need to Talk About Kevin,' Tilda Swinton is this actress.In this case, however, Swinton delivers an outstanding performance, but it does not have the ""all boats rise"" effect on the rest of the film, which is a dark, depressing look into the mind of a disturbed, disruptive young man. In 'Kevin,' we see through the eyes of Swinton's Eva Khatchadourian, a former artists whose life is turned upside-down by an unspeakable event involving her son, Kevin (played by a pre-Flash Ezra Miller), who we see grow up over the years throughout the film. In what was at one point a unique filming technique, director Lynne Ramsay tells this unfortunate story using parallel timelines, where we see how Eva must pick up the pieces of her life after the tragic turn of events, which we finally see at the film's climax. This approach earns points for being something different, but it takes viewers a bit to get acclimated and probably confuses things more than it should.As with any dark drama, there are plenty of elements in 'Kevin' that stand out. From Swinton's portrayal of a mother who feels she has lost all sense of control to the symbol of Kevin's bow and arrow. Swinton laboring over chipping the red paint off her house, spending days to get every last bit out, is representative of her trying to make up for her failure as a parent. There are clues littered throughout the film like breadcrumbs leading to exactly what happened, and while it's possible to predict the outcome, the puzzle pieces that are put together one by one are certainly done in a way that demonstrate the precision in which the film was conceptualized. Aside from Swinton and Miller, John C. Reilly portrays the unconcerned patriarch of the family, but his contribution is not noteworthy.Again, while Swinton carries 'We Need to Talk About Kevin' as best she can, even an award-worthy performance is sometimes not enough when there are deficiencies in other areas.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
88,eagandersongil,The well-treated taboo and the subjectivity of the simple,8,31 January 2017,"subjectivity, and he knows how to deal with it, but sometimes it turns out, it's interesting the point of view chosen in the script, and very interesting that what was to be the protagonist, His dramas, anguishes and thoughts, do not appear in the film, such as kevin, who has his name in the title, and only appears the first time after 20 minutes of film, this seems to be something negative, but it has its qualities. Along with the story of Kevin (Jasper Newell / Ezra Miller), a young man who from this small has a wicked mind, and without explanation carries a hatred for his mother, being able to reach the ultimate consequences only to irritate and to cause evil. With a beautiful clear photograph and many shades of blue, it brings the sobriety of the film, with daring camera angles, it brings all that mystery and subjectivity that I have commented before, it is common closes in mouths or noses, everything is done to instigate The viewer, I can not say that it always works, but it's interesting. Tilda Swinton looks like she's not going to be able to handle the dramatic charge of the movie, but in the end she ends up holding it and surprising it so, Ezra Miller is great in every scene that appears, even though it's few, he completely steals the scene, and Jasper Newell is terrific playing Kevin the kid, what wonderful trifles, and he does not have a psychopath look himself, he has anger in his eyes, incredible as it may seem, it's beautiful to behold. Finally, ""We need to talk about Kevin"" is a movie that will make a big part of your viewers leave the section, this would not surprise me, as Lynne Ramsay sometimes exaggerates when trying to create layers and layers that do not exist, if you lose in trying to create Subjectivity in something simple, and drags his actions to an astonishing but simple illustration-here subjectivity was not necessary-and Kevin's motivation is very weak. But anyway, it's a great film that comes up to deal with and talk about such a taboo subject, and it surprises at times.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
89,W011y4m5,Outstanding,9,3 April 2019,"Tilda Swinton delivers one of the best performances I've ever seen her give throughout her entire career in this film - understated, subtle & yet incredibly moving; a deeply unnerving & yet eerily believable story that explores themes of guilt & how a parent comes to terms with having raised a child who grows up to become a monster.
Lynne Ramsay directs the film masterfully & with precision, managing to helm extremely risky & potentially controversial sequences - never detracting focus from the emotional engagement with the character's emotional progression & journey; violence is often suggested instead of shown, which both unsettles the viewer furthermore - leaving it to their imagination - & refrains from glorifying the horrific acts which feature & turning this into a cliché horror movie, which is refreshing.
Visually, the film is also just as impactful & striking, intellectually communicating with the audience through repeated colour palettes & camera angles, building a sense of familiarity with the visual language of the film so subtextual messages can easily be suggested & noticed, providing the audience with a greater understanding & more rewarding viewing.
Overall, expertly crafted & filmmaking at its best.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
90,Rockwell_Cronenberg,When it's not incoherent it's completely standard.,2,9 December 2011,"This year we've had a lot of films that play around with their timeline, telling things out of chronological order to varying degrees of success. On one end of the spectrum we have Martha Marcy May Marlene, a film that utilizes it's split narrative to create a seamless rhythm that establishes it's tone perfectly and places us into the fragile mind of it's lead character. On the other end we have We Need to Talk About Kevin, a film that couldn't be more over-the-place or less fluid if it tried. Watching the first half hour of this felt like such a chore, bouncing all around through three different time periods with absolutely no flow, jolting me around without giving the possibility to establish anything in mood or ambiance. Out of nowhere it then decides that it wants to tell things straight, barely jumping back to it's present-day period. It's a shame that it decided to spend a lot of it's time here in the past, since this is where it was at it's least interesting. Working in this premise gives potential for some sense of uniqueness and exploring a world that is rarely explored, but instead Kevin takes such standard paths it's kind of hard to believe that someone as unique as Tilda Swinton would dedicate herself to this.The relationship between Kevin and Eva is relatively by-the-books and the depiction of Kevin's darkness growing is absurd to the point of stupidity. The scenes with him as a child felt like they were pulled out of The Omen and as he grew up the character somehow became even more of a one-note caricature. There were some scenes that I couldn't help but laugh out loud at how ridiculous they were. The only remotely interesting part of the film for me came in the study of Eva trying to adjust back into life, but even that eventually ran it's course into the road-always-traveled. This is a film that acts like it's doing something different when ultimately it's doing everything the same, just in a different order and not very well.The performances are...lackluster, to say the least. Ezra Miller is embarrassing, but it's not like the way the character is written gives him a chance to do anything else. Tilda Swinton does what she can but I couldn't help but feel that the character was written into a box where she only operated on one level for the majority of the film, but I was slightly impressed in the brief moments where she got to do something different.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
91,bobbobwhite,The title tells what the mother should have done,6,29 May 2012,"But, she never did it, nor did the clueless father. I immensely disliked the film's subject matter and the stupidity of its main characters, and that made it a slow and aggravating slog for me to get through it, even as I realized that the filmmaker had to strongly provoke us to convey her true message with the intensity it deserved. This is a story of a family with a very mentally ill son. The son's psychopathology was clearly evident at 2-3 years of age, but it was never medically addressed by the parents or professionals. I blame the real possibility of this kind of travesty on our overly rewarding, totally supportive American parental/educational society of today, where little a child does is ever seen as wrong, no matter what, and often even seen as ""special"" and to be rewarded. The sick kid in this film never once was tested by a child shrink or doctor who could have easily seen where he was headed and committed him to a suitable medical facility where he would not be a danger to others. But, no, the parental attitude of ""he is my son, so he must be wonderful"" prevailed and the film's constant ""rub the viewer's face in abject parental stupidity"" eventually aggravated me to the point that I hope the same reaction I had was in every viewer, in the hope that society-devastating child psychopathology can be better detected and controlled. My hope is that it shocks parents into being smarter and having any weird kids such as this one analyzed early on to protect others, instead of protecting them by doing nothing. In old historical times, parents used to chain up seriously mentally ill kids for life, or merely kill them early on. Have we really progressed much by not doing the modern equivalent of that? Look what finally happened in the story and may happen in real life as a result of doing nothing, and it is clear that we may not have progressed much. What the clueless parents eventually got for their ignorant indulgence could be seen by many as just desserts.I do dislike overly choppy, disjointed, and out-of-sequence story lines, and this one-note story was eventually offputting due to that, but not to the point where it negatively affected the film's serious message. I wish that it could be done differently, with less irritation/aggravation, but it surely hit harder due to how much it angered us about incompetent parenting. And, I trust that the message is crystal clear to all viewers, especially parents. It really could happen to you, and to all of us as a society.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
92,doug_park2001,"A Perceptive, Original, but Difficult Film",7,25 May 2013,"""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is full of subtleties, uncertainties, and improbabilities. We are told very little about the characters, and what we are shown is often marginal. Examples: I wanted to know more about the family's background, Kevin's condition (antisocial personality disorder or what?), how he interacts (or doesn't) with the other kids at his school, and most importantly, how he manages to commit this improbable crime. Yet, having said this I have to ask, ""What difference would all that have made?"" As Kevin himself states, ""That's the point: There is no point."" Although the minimalism works in the end, fans of traditional film narrative may find this one a bit frustrating. Having seen it, I'm glad I did, but it's not the sort of thing I want to see again any time soon.The whole mood is, as you can imagine, very bleak, and, for lack of a better term, semi-surreal. The dialogue is especially important: e.g., Kevin: ""You can be kind of harsh sometimes""; Eva (his mother): ""You're a fine one to talk."" The physical traits Kevin and Eva share, while Kevin's father and sister share fairer traits, serve to symbolize how Eva is blamed so cruelly for Kevin's crime and the guilt she feels over same. What ""WNTAK"" shows and does not show leaves room for all kinds of interpretations, but I think it shows very effectively how society is cruel to everyone, and everyone learns, often in the hardest possible ways, from it.The first hour or so is erratic and often confusing with all the jumping back and forth in time, but everything comes into sharper focus during the second half of ""WNTAK."" The fine, fine acting by Swinton, Reilly, and all three actors who play Kevin during various stages of his life is an indispensable strength here: Weaker or merely competent acting would have made this film quite forgettable.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
93,Chris_Pandolfi,"Are Monsters Born, or Are They Made?",9,14 December 2011,"Are monsters born, or are they made? It's obvious that Eva (Tilda  Swinton) was ambivalent about her pregnancy, and by the time her son  Kevin was born, she realized that having a child was never something  she wanted. Throughout all stages of the Kevin's life, we see just how  aware he is of his mother's indifference, and how he uses it against  her. As a baby, he cries incessantly. As a toddler, he develops slowly,  not learning how to speak and seeming uninterested in simple activities  like rolling a ball on the floor. He remains in diapers well into his  elementary school years, at which point he provokes his mother in more  personal ways. As a teen, he appears to have adopted no sense of  morality towards his family or people in general, regarding just about  everyone with contempt. It's at this point that he massacres a group of  his classmates in the school gym with a bow and arrow.  ""We Need to Talk about Kevin,"" based on the novel by Lionel Shriver, is  a tremendously challenging film. It's not only because of its ambiguous  characters and emotionally draining subject matter, but also because it  provides us with no answers. But really, what answer would suffice?  That Kevin is definitely a sociopath? That he was unquestionably raised  by a bad mother? We can all agree that a terrible crime has been  committed, and yet these go-to explanations say more about the  intrinsic need to assign guilt than they do about the people involved.  In Kevin's case, the word ""sociopath"" is never officially applied. And  with the exception of the school tragedy, all of the things he gets  blamed for remain unproven. We only have strong implications, most of  which are made by Eva. And what of her? Inattentiveness, which is  indisputably her condition, is not now and has never been an automatic  catalyst for a child's bad behavior.  The film is constructed not as a linear story but as a random jumble of  memories. Essentially, Eva is trying to process her life over the past  twenty years or so. We see her first happy dates with Franklin (John C.  Reilly), who would go on to be her husband. We see her as a successful  travel agent. We see them together when Kevin is already born;  Franklin, though loving, lives in a deluded state of familial idealism,  and has been manipulated so thoroughly by Kevin that he continuously  turns a blind eye to his cruelty. He will, in fact, often accuse Eva of  blowing situations way out of proportion. We see their second child, a  girl named Celia (Ashley Gerasimovich), who we suspect was conceived  solely to satisfy Eva's desperate need to bond with a child. Indeed,  she dotes over her daughter, and the two get along wonderfully. But how  fair is this, replacing one child with another?  We see her after the school tragedy, understandably shellshocked. She  lives alone in a new house and is forced to take a job at a second-rate  travel agency in a strip mall. She's despised by the much of the  community for being the mother of a murderer. She spends much of her  time scraping red paint off of her front porch  obviously the work of  angry vandals. In an early scene, she's approached by a woman she  doesn't know and is quite suddenly smacked across the face. Does Eva  deserve this kind of treatment? She's later approached by one of  Kevin's victims, who now sits in a wheelchair. The young man shows no  hostility towards Eva at all. Does he have a right to be mad at her? We  see her visiting Kevin in prison, unsuccessfully trying to probe his  mind and find a reason why.  The two key performances are by Jasper Newell and Ezra Miller. The  former plays Kevin from the ages of six to eight, while the latter  plays him as a teenager. As played by both actors, we see a horrifying  yet remarkably intelligent person working, and in two distinct  instances succeeding, at getting his mother's attention. This is not to  suggest that he craves her love. He wants, for lack of a better term,  an audience. The irony is that, despite Kevin's viciousness and Eva's  intensifying fear of her son, they are the most authentic people in  each other's lives. Eva probably understands her son better than she  cares to admit. Complicating these characters and their relationship  even further are two scenes in which Kevin actively seeks his mother's  affection.  Questions will repeatedly surface. Did Kevin intentionally put caustic  drain fluid in his sister's eye, causing permanent blindness and the  need for a glass replacement? Did he knowingly kill her pet gerbil and  stuff it into the garbage disposal? Director/co-writer Lynne Ramsay is  well aware of the conclusions most audiences will automatically come  to, and that's what makes this movie so fascinating: It ultimately says  more about us than it does about the characters. No matter who you are,  no matter what you believe, you will definitely be bringing something  to ""We Need to Talk about Kevin."" It shows not the slightest interest  in actions or even in consequences, but in behaviors  and,  consequently, in the mystery of their very existence. On that note, I  leave you with the very same question I started this review with. Are  monsters born, or are they made?",We Need to Talk About Kevin
94,ExpendableMan,"Robin Hood, Robin Hood, riding through the glen",9,3 July 2015,"Coming off like a post-Columbine version of 'The Omen,' Lynne Ramsay's 'We Need To Talk About Kevin' is an absolute tour-de-force of a film. Based on the novel of the same name, it's a dark, engaging and riveting experience and definitely not one to watch if you're currently expecting children. With a career-best performance from Tilda Swinton, plus a deeply unsettling Ezra Miller dripping malice throughout, it'll make you terrified of ankle biters all over again. But this time, there's no supernatural terrors to be found, Kevin is simply evil to the core.Told largely in flashbacks, the film revolves around tormented mother Eva Khatchadourian (Swinton) and her unhinged son (Miller). Shunned by the community and dealing with an unspoken tragedy, Eva is clearly traumatised and it soon becomes clear that Miller's incarcerated teenager has done something very bad indeed. You'll figure out what that was long before the film tells you, but as the story of Kevin's birth and upbringing unfolds, it's almost impossible to look away.What follows is essentially a battle of wits as a mother locks horns with a son who right from the moment he's born, seems to inexplicably hate her. There's a couple of excellent performances from child actors Rock Duer and Jasper Newell that manage to make a pre-pubescent boy one of the most detestable villains in recent years and when he reaches his teenage years, Kevin grows ever more malicious. He commits heinous acts against his little sister, her pet hamster and he treats the entire world around him with bored contempt. All that is except for his dad (John C. Reilly in a relatively thankless role). To him, Kevin is a smiling, upbeat lad and his persistent refusal to accept anything is wrong drives a wedge into his and Eva's relationship. What's especially impressive though is that even without showing any real violence, the movie is still horrific to watch. The gore is hinted at through several subtle images, a sandwich oozing with raspberry jam, splashes of red paint on a porch and one especially nasty scene where Kevin chews on a lychee. This is a film where not a single shot is wasted and it all builds up to an inevitably grim finale.Despite this however, there's still a few rare glimpses of warmth to be found. There's one moment where Eva nurses her poorly offspring and the look of joy on her face when he snuggles into her is all the more devastating for how brief it is, while the closing confrontation offers a rare glimpse of humanity behind his surly mask. Watching this final scene is a bit like letting out a breath you've held in for an hour and a half, but even as the relief that the film has reached an end hits, you'll immediately want to go on the Internet and register your approval. You'll be staring at the screen through the gaps in your fingers for this one, brilliant film.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

It manages to throw light upon a very difficult subject and is entertaining as well. Tilda Swinton does a superb job portraying a mother who knows her child is not 'normal' - in fact we, as observers, might even make a diagnosis. Sociopath/psychopath seems to fit. The young Kevin is played brilliantly by Jasper Newell - played so well its easy to hate him (the character he plays, that is). Thankfully we are not shown the gory details, there are just metaphorical references - especially in the use of colour....interestingly, starting off with the red tomato festival in Spain. Mothers who do not bond with their children are generally made to feel at fault - and this issue is very well conveyed. It is clear also that the mother/Eva knows well enough that her child is abusive and manipulative. She cannot escape the feelings of guilt however. Everyone seems to condemn her and she appears at surface level to accept this, except we also see that she doesn't! Quite marvellous that the clarity of this dual sense can be conveyed in film.

The extreme of competition is 'last man standing' and that is why competition between people is evil.You may compete against yourself for perfection and you may take help from others to show you your imperfection and, to be sure, I compete when I play ping-pong but not in order to win when I'm not better and only to become better. That's why it is so much more interesting to play against the guy that is better than yourself for even if you never beat him you still get to learn a lot. Trying to solve the enigma of not being able to beat him is what drives you on, not the actual beating him.Now that this is said and you understand that I am not for just lying around farting, I can go back to this abomination of competition between people where everything is about winning, regardless of whether you are truly better or not.Who is the best human being? The one that manages to get to the top where he can oppress all others or the one who could never aspire for such a thing out of love for his fellow man? This is a rhetorical question in case you did not know.Furthermore, what is the difference morally, between the man who kills others and the man who exploits others? They both steal life but the latter makes a profit on it and, if attaining a high enough position in society, may also kill if it becomes necessary for the good of the corporation and, of course, with no fear for retribution, which, by the way, the poor killer can be sure of receiving.The unfair treatment of the mother of this story in this society of abomination, bears a glimpse of the true issues involved and that is why this movie gets a five. Otherwise, it is sadly just the usual stigmatization of the individual having 'bad genes' instead of the society having bad ideals.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
98,kikiboo_8,Depressing...,5,8 March 2021,"Pretty sad. Kevin seemed to be evil from the very beginning, even as a baby. He got worse over time. I think that Eva definitely played a role. I know she loved him deep down and that she cared about him essentially, but still. She was always frustrated by him, by his tantrums, by his behavior... So, she wasn't exactly the warmest or most patient and understanding of mothers. She was frequently abusive to him both verbally and physically. I know how she must have felt because of him all the time, so I know she'd lose her cool and say or do some regrettable things. Point being, her behavior certainly didn't help Kevin nor did it do him any good. I know she did the best she could, she didn't really know any better. It's only partly her fault. For not being what he needed her to be. For not handling him better. But she was human, she was very flawed and she did the best she was able, to no avail.
It's actually pretty sad because a lot of parents out there are like her and they simply can't reach their child, despite the love or the good intentions, their approach only makes things worse. And we get a couple of new Kevins every now and then as result. Such a shame. But that's just a sad reality...",We Need to Talk About Kevin

Though you might guess what this is pretty early on.THe point is that the story follows the mum, not the child, and the consequences the parent has to deal with after, and before, the actions of their psychotic child.I don't think the story is actually believable, which was a little disappointing, the parents were too close, too kind, too sane, and too happy together, children that commit such crimes don't come from such families, and will torture and mane more animals than one hamster before the 'main event'.Although clearly weird, Kevin just came across as an annoying git you;d send to boarding school rather than psychopathic.The idea of this film is great though, and hopefully more follow in its footsteps in focusing the attention of the film on a character that would normally just be in the background, and ask the viewer, how much is their fault, what could they have done differently, and what do they do now?",We Need to Talk About Kevin

The movie starts off with a dream sequence. You don't know what the hell is going on, and your really confused on how it relates to the plot. This is because the movie takes place in the mind of the mother. While other movies focus on how the offender feels, this one shows you how the mother goes through this... The movie was disturbing, and somehow makes you only want to watch it once. The tone was very bleak and how the movie progressed was the strangest. Instead of playing in chronological order, the film skips around in various places, and it gets confused sometimes. My only guess is that the director wanted to make it feel as the mind, where the thoughts keep coming and coming. Thankfully, during the middle, the film keeps a steady pace. The acting in this film was amazing. The most notable is Tilda Swinton. She played the mother, and the way she acted was hauntingly beautiful. She plays so real as a mother it's crazy, and the rest of the supporting cast were great to. The one thing I wanted to talk about is the soundtrack. It was amazing! The film knew when and where to place these tracks to add another layer of feeling. Also, I've never said this before, but the film's sound editing was brilliant. You hear whispers and voices, and then the soundtrack gleaming in the background. And when the film transitions, it was dreamy cut from before. But the one thing I hear people complaining about is how the other tracks (the folk/blues songs) were badly misused. In MY opinion, these were fitting to the film. Although, at first, your confused on why they would've put it there, it fits the tone of the film. As said before, the film is highly disturbing and I think these songs add to the overall feel (just like those happy, sappy songs they place in horror films.) I also would like to discuss how people are complaining how this movie is too over-the-top. Explain to me, how? You only describe how ""unrealistic"" it is for a kid to do these things. It's called manipulation, and yeah, it happens! But that's just me, I think that these people have no clue what they're talking about, because this film is as realistic as they get. All in all, I recommend this masterpiece of a movie. It's a dark, realistic, thriller that is uniquely edited.

But all that hype made me kind of disappointed. I expected something more cathartic, something more.The biggest problem lies in the combination of non-chronological story telling and the auditory side of the movie. It makes the whole movie feel like several dream sequences. It made me think what part of this is happening for real and what isn't. That doesn't seem like the right feeling this movie should give out to the viewer. Non-chronological story telling can be tricky, but on the other hand it's one of the best things about this movie. There were several scenes that made no sense, when you tried to understand when it was happening, until the very end, when it all clicks into place. Of course I could've just paid attention to Eva's hairstyle, but that's not always the first thing in my mind. This is a dark, intense movie, but in my opinion something was missing. Also it may just require viewing it another time. Still I kept expecting something different and something better.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

The film continuously jumps to other timelines while maintaining an overall chronological story arc. It succeeds on many fronts in displaying the frustrations of the mother and evilness of the son who plays out his mother against his father. There's a genuine art house feel to the bold way it is filmed and edited which feels very unpolished with continuous visual hints towards the conclusion of the story using easy to catch symbolism. Swinton seems to be underplaying her role which, as fan of her previous work, was a bit disappointing but doesn't hinder the film in any way.

107,Tcarts76,Great movie to show a Freshmen High School class to help reduce teen pregnancy rates!,8,16 October 2012,"This was quite the interesting movie. We have seen similar movies with some sort of evil, or vindictive child as the villain. Such movies as ""The Good Son"" (1993) or ""The Omen"" (1976 & 2006) come to mind. This one is a bit different though. It's not a foster child, the devil's offspring, or a case of possession by some evil spirit over a poor innocent child.We need to talk about Kevin, is the story of a mother who gives birth to a child who, from the excessive crying as an infant on to his teenage years, continue to exhibit exceedingly disturbing behavior. Tilda Swinton plays the role of the mother of Kevin and is continually harassed and mentally tortured by her son and gets no help from her husband, his father (John C. Reilly) who continually feels that she is imagining things. The story kind of flashes from the present where she is a down and out social outcast who has no friends and seems to have a large amount of enemies, then back to the continuing story line of the Kevin's childhood where they are a family that seems to have it all.I do have some issues with this movie that keeps it down to an 8 for me. 1st, the way this movie is shot and put together . I wasn't a fan of it, but that is just a personal preference. It did give it a stark, almost inescapable feel, but it also could bore some viewers. 2nd was the script. Tilda Swinton did a decent job with her role and the different actors playing Kevin were a huge highlight, but to me a lot of the script was a little unbelievable to me. Maybe it is my age, but when I grew up, there was some things said in the movie that if I or any of my friends, or anyone I know for that matter , would have said to my parents I would not have been able to sit on my rear end for weeks. The inaction of the parents was just completely unbelievable. Maybe only today do parents just sit idle and silent through such things. That being said it was still a great movie.If they played this movie to every Freshman high school class, I bet teen pregnancy rates would drop dramatically, just with the thought that they may get saddled with a child like this.The reason this movie is so good is that it forces you to think about a lot of questions. Things like, is she (the mother) to blame, is she a bad person, is she guilty of something. Is she a victim? What should she have done, what could she have done, and what would you do? Are some people just born evil, or is it nurturing that makes them turn that way? This movie makes you think about those questions without answering them for you. It waffles between scenes where you could see that the parents have some guilt to scenes that seem to point to Kevin just being a ""Bad seed.""Like my reviews, hate em?

By the way, any story that's about children who don't behave like the Disney dreams that they sometimes are portrayed as, is good in my book from the get-go; toddlers are zombies and kids are individuals, and as such (and human) they can be just as nasty as 5-80 years later.

109,mrcibubur,A Dramatic and Touching Must See Drama,8,23 January 2012,"This is without doubt an excellent intense drama film and may rank as Tilda Swintons best acting performance in a movie so far. In many ways, the film is as much about her as the Mother struggling to cope with her child Kevin as it is about Kevin himself.I agree with earlier comments that the ending of the film is a tad tame and the climax of the film comes half way through the film. My own view that the film is careful not to show what Kevin actually does (and also what happened to his Sisters eye) but the subtlety of the filming enables us to work everything out.I would have liked to see a more objective appraisal within the storyline of the counter-hatred which was shown towards the family. It came across that the Mum and Dad were caring parents but Eva was somewhat indifferent to the different confrontational situations and as for the Dad, well, forgot his name already but the guy is miscast and does not hit any high spots for me, he does not connect well in the overall film. May be that is purposeful and we should be blaming the Father more than the Mother.Oddly I watched 'Descendants' earlier in the day which had a similar 'Guilt' theme about a husband concerned about his dying wife after an accident.This is a drama film plain and simple and not horror but there are elements about it which will disturb you, yes indeed, like Orphan, like Fatal Attraction (pet animal cooked scene).I actually compare it with 'Carnage' which is a glorified stage play transferred into a movie about two sets of parents arguing over a school fight. 'Kevin' is also about every parents responsibilities and inability to manage their children in difficult situations and asking themselves what they are doing wrong.It is a must see film and I rate it better than 'Descendants"" overall",We Need to Talk About Kevin
110,RockPortReview,"Kevin is a pretty disturbed Kid, way to go Mom!",8,3 December 2012,"In the final review of the Summer of Swinton tribute to actress Tilda Swinton we arrive at the 2011 film ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"". Like most all of Swinton's films, this drama packs a powerful and brutal emotional punch. This was also the third feature film by critically acclaimed Scottish director Lynn Ramsay who's previous films were ""Ratcatcher"" and ""Morvern Callar"" Swinton plays Eva Khatchadourian a wife, mother, author and world traveler. Her husband Franklin is played by the extremely versatile John C. Reilly, who is more or less relegated to the supportive husband role but still turns in a great performance. Since the story is told over the course of their son Kevin's life, Kevin is played by three different actors. Mostly disturbingly by Ezra Miller as the teenage version. This movie is about the relationship between a mother and son. It is about Eva's need for freedom and to never be tied down. It's also a classic case of nature versus nurture as there are many difficult questions raised by what happens.The story is told in a non-linear format which seamlessly jumps back and fourth in time in the lives of Eva, Franklin, Kevin, and their younger daughter Celia. We start with the aftermath of an ""event"" and Eva being a local pariah, openly being slapped in the face and called names in public. We flash back to an earlier time in her life and her relationship with Franklin and her pregnancy with Kevin. After he is born Eva and Kevin have a hard time bonding. Even as an infant and a toddler he openly antagonized her and makes her life a living hell. He seems to gets along just fine with his father and he even throws that into her face. After not starting to talk until very late, Kevin is taken to a doctor and he checks out just fine. Is he not talking on purpose just to spite Eva? Through the years Kevin gets even more violent and manipulative, then to a point of just plain sadism.""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is a drama that ends up playing like a psychological horror movie reminiscent of ""The Omen"". Although done in a extremely real and down to earth way. From birth Kevin is a soulless being who's only mission in life is to torment his mother (sound like your kids?), who when she became pregnant wasn't sure she wanted him to begin with. Did Kevin pick up on these negative vibes in the womb? That would be quite the grudge. Is this a big message for the pro choice people? Tilda Swinton puts forth a remarkable performance that earned her a Golden Globe nom for Best Actress. She also won many other accolades and nominations for her role as Eva. ""Kevin"" is now out on DVD from Oscilloscope Films and I highly recommend picking it up!",We Need to Talk About Kevin

The issue of diligent parenting versus upbringing a difficult child since birth makes it hard to pinpoint who should take the blame entirely.But what was clear is that this family had issues that were way beyond anything that can be controlled or remedied effectively but instead were being dealt with by ignorance. Many things evil in the film are against normality and are rather hard to swallow. However even with such a heavy subject matter and the film being a commendable work overall, my hope for some sort of explanation or progress was dashed as the film just sort of glided through the past and paid little attention to attend to addressing the issues presented, or to provide a more three-dimensional perception on the psychological behaviour -- which in that case less of the red throughout the film would help too. Still, I am surprised that it is underrated and did not win any awards.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
113,Semisonic,Intentionally disturbing and emotionally manipulative,5,24 June 2015,"Just in case you need a synopsis, We Need to Talk About Kevin (WNtTAK) is a story of a relationship between an unhappy mother and an estranged son. They failed to get along from the get-go, and it only gets worse with time. But this is what the trailers might've already told you.What the trailers don't tell you is that WNtTAK is a really manipulative flick. Most of the time it seems that its only purpose is to show you the awkward scenes to make you feel uncomfortable. And yes, if that really is the film's purpose then it does succeed at it since one can hardly stay detached when watching this movie.I can't go much deeper into the particular details of the scenes or the relationships between the characters without spoiling anything. Moreover, i don't think one should analyze those scenes, because doing so would be falling for the trick this movie tries to play on its audience. The trick being to squeeze the whole gamut of negative emotions out of the watching crowd. The only thing worth mentioning about WNtTAK is that there IS a difference between true gritty drama and emotional manipulation. People who say that all films are manipulative in a sense must really watch this one to feel the difference. Because it's one thing to be presented something which is shocking in its genuineness, and another when you have to witness the scenes intentionally contrived to desecrate things you hold pure in your heart and produce the shocking or disturbing outcome. This film belongs to the latter category.Despite the ugly overall approach to the storytelling, We Need to Talk About Kevin has one true plus, and it's the acting. Indeed, you must act really well to produce some kind of a real emotion in a viewer, and it requires much more talent to bring on hate or disgust than sympathy or love. Jasper Newell and Ezra Miller, who played Kevin on two different stages of maturity, both did a brilliant job showing us an image of a really messed up, borderline mentally sick, kid with a penchant for angst, psychological manipulation and a twisted sense of rebelliousness. Tilda Swinton is, as always, awesome at delivering a bizarre and inexplicably deformed character, which all of her roles seem to be. This time she's a mother who's a perpetual hostage of her own son's hatred and of the stereotype of a good parent, which she desperately (and unsuccessfully) tries to be. The rest of the cast, including John C. Reilly, playing a good father who seems to never be around when it really matters, are just a filler in this story that never tries to be anything but a fight between anger and guilt.I find it pleasing to believe that maybe the emotions Kevin expresses in his last scene are what the filmmakers ended up having. Surely, just like the mob of parents killed with grief, the audience is raging with anger towards one character or another. Lynne Ramsay, on the other hand, is a mastermind behind this bloody mess. Why did she do it? I guess she used to think she knew. My only hope is that now she's not so sure.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

While BBC has probably had a very different and more self-serving interpretation in mind, they certainly do empathize with the psychopathy (which is also manifest in their foreign policy, in a nutshell) while despising the victims, psychopathy that is only slightly skewed but indeed all too common in society based on hypo crisy, self delusion and centuries of violent oppression.

I'ts more like ""Eraserhead"" than ""Days of our Lives"" and the child was straight out of one of the Damien movies. What happened in the film was unspeakably violent but what was actually shown? The child's disdain for his mother is everywhere to be found and his radical switch when talking to his father of his father is so completely different that it would be impossible NOT to notice the difference. That's an example of why the script was never meant to be normal or real. A child who screams incessantly is a nightmare and nightmares aren't real. What Kevin actually did to his sister isn't shown at all but implied and obliquely at that. This is a film without answers, certainly not medical ones. It is a mother's worst dream but it is a dream nonetheless. There are surprises all over and I, for one, was glued to the screen, trying to out-guess the out-guessable and predict the unpredictable. One good example of the film's unreality - the locks Kevin receives and plans to sell to students in his school - is pure Bunuel.

119,dharmendrasingh,Bad Mother or Evil Seed?,9,30 October 2011,"This is quite simply one of the best films of the year. Even the book's author, Lionel Shriver (a woman) praises the film, calling it 'a brilliant adaptation'. Being a first-time dad, the story fascinated me. What happens if you don't love your own child... and they know it? Tilda Swinton, not normally a favourite of mine, is exceedingly good as Eva, the mum uninterested in maternity. Gravid when she least wants to be (she's career-minded), out pops Kevin, her little Damien. You know from the moment she refuses skin-to-skin things are not going to bode well. She has no idea how to deal with a baby. Her idea of subduing him is to stand next to a pneumatic drill to drown out his relentless screaming. Kevin grows up knowing he is unloved and demonstrates this through devilish behaviour towards Eva. Gradually Eva, if not embraces motherhood, then at least gets better at it. Perhaps this is due to her giving birth to her second child, a girl, who Kevin of course hates with a passion. Or maybe the idea of being a mum sinks in, along with the realisation that a career is not the most important thing in life.Eva's betterments do nothing to placate Kevin: he gets worse. Eva's attempts to complain are met with ridicule by the father (John C. Reilly), who thinks she is delusional. Years of unintentional, but sometimes intentional, neglect take their toll on Kevin, and the film's tragic conclusion seems inevitable.The origin for Kevin's behaviour has polarised audiences. Did Eva create a monster by failing to form a bond early on? Should she have sought help from professionals if she felt she wasn't coping? Or was Kevin simply a bad seed; an innately evil child who no one could have cured? Now that I've had the chance to reflect, I think it's unfair to judge son or mother. I'd be surprised if Ramsay wanted audiences to do that. What would be the point? The film is a starkly brilliant exploration of a failed relationship and the consequences that has on a family and an entire community. If Swinton can win an Oscar so easily for her role in 'Michael Clayton', she should be celebrating her second win now. It's one of those performances which needs months of detoxification and psychoanalysis to move on from. Her acting is matched by new-kid-on-the-block Ezra Miller, who plays her lovelorn son. He brings to his role a controlled ferocity we are not used to seeing. His portrayal works, apart from his first-class acting, because he's not the stereotype. To look at him, you would say he was handsome and ingenuous. But looks are deceptive. It's hard for people to be repulsed by films nowadays, but there are scenes which will shock. So rare is it to see this kind of film. They vanish as quickly as they appear. I implore you to see this if you can.

Tilda does it AGAIN!!!!",8,19 November 2011,"It's pretty common knowledge that Tilda Swinton is up there as being one of the most talented actresses working today and once again she absolutely blows the audience away with her terrifically understated performance of a woman dealing with the aftermath of a crime her Omen like child has committed. This movie is at times difficult to sit through, plenty of times i was so frustrated and i found myself begging Eva and her husband to give Kevin the slightest bit of discipline, i kinda felt that if this child wasn't allowed to run rampant the way he does that there would be no problem, but then i suppose there would be no movie.Lynne Ramsay certainly has a style of directing, the symbolism throughout this movie is not overdone in the slightest, and the cinematography and the way the story unfolds is very similar to her previous film Morvern Callar, however i have to say all these things work much better in this film.Much can be said about the cast of this movie, John. C Reilly is his usual great self in a role that i usually wouldn't imagine him in but he does a swell job, and Ezra Miller is perfect as the psychotic Kevin, but as i said earlier, the heart and soul of this movie is Tilda, she is down right amazing, this role in anyone Else's hands would have been totally different and her work on screen is the work of a true acting genius, the mere mention of her name is enough for most people to say yes to seeing a movie.This movie is a thought provoker so definitely go with a friend and go for coffee afterward because its definitely one that will spark conversation, it's a film that each person will be affected by differently so go see it and make up your own mind.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
121,deschreiber,why the time fragmentation and flashbacks?,8,20 February 2012,"A disturbing film, well made, but I wonder about the purpose of presenting it with time cut into bits, with so much of the story given in flashbacks. I don't quite see how that added to the story, other than giving it an ""arty"" feel. Maybe presented chronologically, the conclusion would have been too obvious? Maybe it would have been less compelling if the viewer wasn't forced to do so much piecing together of jigsaw pieces? It did seem a little artificial to me, not quite ""precious"" but somewhat forced. Otherwise a very good movie.Was Tilda Swinton good in her role? Good, yes. The mother is shocked, stunned, drained of emotion in the aftermath; she's quietly confused and tormented before. But the role didn't call for a great range of emotions and, while Swinton portrayed the character effectively--all praise to her--much of it was as the shell of a woman, hollowed out by a horror. I'm not sure that's what an Academy award is for.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
122,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,I can't find any words to summarise this film...,6,5 September 2014,"There's definitely something about this film that hits an emotional chord with certain people, I can see that, but for me I found it rather unrewarding.I don't want to go into my deep feelings about society, or perhaps the negative BBC perspective on mankind's outlook or the way we (shouldn't) bring up our children, I just want to talk about my superficial feelings and why I didn't enjoy this movie, although it has made me realise that I need to speak kind words to my wife and give encouragement to my children, and for that I'm thankful.I can only imagine that Tilda Swinton was chosen for the role because ""she's kinda funny looking"" (Fargo 1996). I think at one point Kevin says he's probably the way he is because of her, which would make sense. But you can't sympathise with mother - she radiates as much warmth as a stick insect. So the boy's a deranged human being because he's the offspring of a strange, equally deranged, perhaps formerly abused woman, but the choice of Tilda Swinton seems such a bad choice of actress for this role. Where's the surprise, sympathy or caring for the lady and her plight? Who cares what happens to Mum or Kevin at the end of the film when Mum was largely responsible for it all anyway, even though we don't know why.As a superficial film goer, I would like to have seen Angelina Jolie play the role. A pretty lady with a dollop of spite, equally capable of being devastated by spawning the devil's child.On to John C. Reilly. He's one of those actors that I have to slightly brace myself against his cardboard delivery. I really like him, but he was also badly mis-cast. Again, the director chose the rubbery, nonchalant personality of the actor to reflect the unawareness of what was happening at home, and to his own family, but he was completely irrelevant. Put it this way - there were a couple of sex scenes which had me pleading at the screen for no-nudity please. The last thing I wanted to see was an absolutely sexless couple stripping off in front of the screen.And most of all, the film bored me. It didn't surprise or shock me at all, so it would have been better with a straightforward plot in which we knew from the outset that Kevin was a nutter, led on by an equally distracted mother. We could have done with some history of child abuse in relation to Tilda Swinton, something like that, just to understand the mother's demeanour because, as I've already suggested, she didn't become miserable and distracted because of her evil son, but due to something prior and prevalent within herself that produced that offspring.Lastly, if the film was rated more accurately at 6+, I could have avoided it. Instead I watched it, knowing it was going to be difficult, but expecting something better based on that high rating. Yes, high expectations often lead to disappointment, but this is a disappointment based on lack of hope, evil and sadness. Not the ultimate hope achieved through a classic film like 'Taxi Driver', regardless of how much expectation might be had at first, or how bleak, pointless or meandering it seems throughout the film.I've rated 840 or so films on IMDb, of which I've given about 20-25 a 10/10 rating, so I'm just questioning those of you out there who have given 10/10 to this particular film. Really?",We Need to Talk About Kevin
123,Treyroo,Haunting,8,24 November 2012,"Could you stand to have the entire course of your life defined by one horrific act? If so, imagine said act being committed by someone else. In fact, not just someone else, but your own son.The film opens on a dream sequence that I struggle to see the relevance of even now and, when it ends, we are introduced to a waking Eva Katchadourian (played by Tilda Swinton). Eva is living in a run-down house that has recently been vandalized along with her car. Rather than report it, Eva (Swinton) merely cleans the windshield and departs on a search for employment. She was once a successful travel writer but has experienced great difficulty finding work since her son Kevin (played by Ezra Miller) took it upon himself to carry out a massacre in his high school. Kevin was a difficult child from infancy, crying incessantly at all hours while Eva's husband Franklin (played by John C. Reilly) is out of the house working. As Kevin grows older, the difficulties only increase. He doesn't speak or appear to understand when others do as a toddler. When he finally does speak, he refuses to be toilet trained. This frustrates Eva till she throws Kevin against a wall, breaking his arm. It wasn't clear, at least to me, whether it was intentional or not, but Kevin claims he fell and returns home willing and able to use the toilet. Franklin (Reilly) is amazed and delighted while Eva is consumed by guilt. When their second child is born, things only get worse.Swinton's character is far from perfect, but on some level, the audience sympathizes with her. Both as a mother whose son is clearly more disturbed than her husband is capable of realizing and as the widow being harassed on a nearly constant basis for a crime she didn't commit. Reilly's character is infuriating, but only viewing the problem from Eva's eyes makes it a lot easier to see than it would be for someone spending most of the day outside the home. Prior to watching this film, my only knowledge of Miller's acting was when he guest-starred as the precocious son of a wealthy, absentee father with substance abuse issues on the USA Network show Royal Pains. That character was highly likable in addition to being entertaining and the total opposite of Kevin which he plays perfectly.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
124,chet19,Just Missed Being a 10,9,22 December 2020,"Could have been a perfect 10, except for the unnecessary timeline shifting. It was extremely distracting to see Tilda having two kids, and then seeing her pregnant, and then realizing the pregnancy is a flashback to kid #1, and then seeing kid #1 as a teenager, and then seeing him as a toddler, and then Tilda has a second kid, and then seeing her pregnant.
How about simply letting the timeline flow. It would be far more effective to see the devolution of Kevin instead of throwing disjointed scenes all over the place.
Still, this movie is a gem.
Typically, the broken timeline confusion in other movies earns a low rating from me, but not in this case. There is so much tension in so many scenes...great acting and great cast.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

All this to make place for slow motion shots of several kinds of red substances over an awkward score while she cheaply generates tension by making her characters behave stupid for no obvious reason besides deliberately stressing the viewer (which makes the movie extremely hard to watch), striping this down to some odd melodrama about a woman who had an asshole child.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

127,Cinnyaste,We Need To Watch Kevin,8,8 December 2011,"Given headlines screaming the horrors of school violence, this subject is a well-plowed cinematic field. In ""Elephant"" and other films the dark light shines mostly on the perpetrator(s). There are few peeks beyond the manicured suburban lawns to the crucibles behind expensive window treatments. ""...Kevin"" boldly parts the curtains to scrutinize the Mother-Son relationship. And serves up a tragic recipe for a monster-in-the-making.In ""Bowling For Columbine,"" Michael Moore asks Marilyn Manson what he would have said to the infamous Colorado duo. Manson wisely replies, ""Nothing. I would have listened to them. Which obviously no one did.""In ""...Kevin,"" the flighty, depressed Mother, Tilda Swinton, is ill-equipped to handle responsibility. World travels interrupted by her (then) boyfriend's plea, ""I miss you,"" she relents and transforms into a trapped hausfrau who papers a room with maps and travel posters. She screams, ""I'd rather be in France,"" when Kevin tests her wafer thin patience.Early on, post-tragedy, Mom dreams of the time she was carried Christ-like through tomato-strewn streets at a La Tomatina Festival. Swimming in the blood red, Eva (a reference to Eve - the first Woman), will die emotionally and socially for the sins of her son. Christ, however, did not create the monsters destroying him. Eva as Christ is a symbol of guilt at the extreme impatience, manipulation, narcissism, verbal and physical abuse (she breaks Kevin's arm) she unlovingly ladled on her first born. She just doesn't get it.A passerby's nasty glance judges Eva's inability to care for the stroller-bound, bawling infant Kevin. (She mouths 'Fuck'; her embarrassment more important than Kevin's cries.) Shortly after, in a remarkable scene, to escape Kevin's incessant howling, Eva parks the stroller mere feet away from a jackhammer at full bore. Her face is orgiastic at the momentary escape. It quickly fades as Kevin's cries rise above the insufferable street din.Later, at her minimal wits end, Eva ushers the four year old, uncommunicative (with her) Kevin to the Doctor's office. She's concerned he's autistic. The Doctor reports he's a healthy kid. This convenient escape route closed, Eva is still perplexed when Kevin won't respond to her relentless demands to say ""Mommy."" The emotionally immature Eva desperately needs her child's validation in that parental label. He withholds in response to her withholding. A circle with a tragic endpointKevin is beyond precocious, very intelligent, and an apple that has not fallen far from Mom's tree. He is a mirror image and quickly learns how to manipulate her right back. The clueless Dad, John Reilly, sees, as do all others, a very different Kevin: a happy, well adjusted kid. Eva's protestations fall on deaf ears. Hubby says she's the one that needs, ""to talk to someone (therapist) about it."" He's correct, but unsupportive. He's having too much fun with the kids (and constantly working) to do much parenting himself. And he (literally) introduces Kevin to the weapon he'll later use.Completely alone, Eva spirals farther into depression and becomes a more effective mentor to the budding sociopath. Which comes first, chicken or egg? In ""...Kevin"" it's decidedly the chicken.Kevin's torture of Eva is complete when he leaves her the only family member to survive in a small town where, at every turn, a grieving parent confronts the pariah whose son killed their precious (and probably equally misunderstood) child. A co-worker (at a job she was lucky to get) drunkenly comes on to her at the office Christmas party with, ""Who else would want you?""Simply, Tilda Swinton is amazing. Unafraid, she welcomes wholly unglamorous, emotionally wrenching roles. (See: ""Julia"" and ""Michael Clayton"") ""...Kevin"" is another tour-de-force. She quietly portrays this tortured, trapped woman with a barely perceptible wince or gesture. Her splayed legs are even effective in shots of her weak-kneed stumbles from court proceedings.Wild kudos to the remarkable performances by the two Kevins. Jasper Newell makes it easy to believe the rage roiling behind his six year old eyes; Ezra Miller brings an effective creepiness to the deeply troubled, quietly psychotic Teen Kevin.If fault is to be found it is in the unnecessarily gimmicky direction. Deconstructing the film's potent story into a non-linear timeline dilutes the effort. The interspersed, quick, gauzy shots through wet windshields accompanied by police siren sound effects detract. The viewer is immediately aware of the story's tack, and the editorial hocus-pocus becomes an annoyance, as do a surfeit of focus/defocus shots. Further, a little more scissor could have been applied to the 112 minute length. Important information is lost in passing whispers, and the happyish ending is out of place.The title's irony is Kevin is the last one needing a talk. It's dear old Mom who should answer, ""Why did you get married and have kids anyway. You knew. Deep down.""The archetypal dreadful Mother a la no-wire-hangers is mostly used to comedic effect. In the wrong hands it's a hackneyed plot device. Fortunately, it's in the right hands here. ""...Kevin"" has the courage to point at environment as the main factor in the making of a killer. Too easily teachers, the media, violent films and video games are blamed for those who have gone postal. In these cases, somnambulist parents fail to take responsibility and question how their kid could have done such a horrific thing.Eva is a victim. Her parents aren't portrayed, but her back story is clear as a bell. Even though she half-heartedly attempts at parenting Kevin, it's selfishness and lack of commitment to a difficult child at the root of this tragedy.""We Need To Talk About Kevin"" is required viewing by everyone who is, or wishes to become, a parent. Mothers aren't always to blame for their children's actions, but this film correctly posits sometimes they are accountable. Good reason to experience this terrific, harrowing film.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
128,kevjfarrell,A lot to think about - not an easy watch!,9,28 May 2015,"This film is disturbing, it makes you question yourself and other people you've known in your life. I only watched the movie all the way through quite recently, and once seen it lives with you. I've been reading some of the reviews and some people are trying to find a reason for this young guy's actions, suggesting that the answers are to be found in his upbringing/childhood. This is certainly the case for a lot of behaviors in more 'well-adjusted' youths, but there are a small number of individuals like this young man where it's more to do with the hard-wiring in the brain and a form of chemical imbalance. This is what makes a Sociopath. In extreme cases, there is no cure at the moment for people like this and how we deal with people like this will always be a contentious issue. Sociopaths are different in that a lot of their behaviour is borne from nurture and environment and can be treated quite successfully in the right hands. You can show a sociopath the error of their ways and if they are willing, they can be reformed. Psychopaths are a totally different matter. This isn't a movie for everybody. I thoroughly enjoyed it because it gives you so much to think about on so many levels. It doesn't make for comfortable watching. Having worked with young people with severe problems, this was a well portrayed account of behaviour that is disturbing at the highest level because you know you are dealing with something that's outside your realms of understanding. Fortunately characters like this are few and far between. One criticism, I feel that the father's script and acting wasn't completely accurate. The despair of his mother and her realization that she has created a monster was first class!!!! Make sure you know what you're letting yourself in for before watching this movie. The movie only raises questions - no answers - and that's a good thing. Sadly, it takes a major event before any intervention takes place, and then it is purely punitive and very little is learned. Even if you can study the brain and detect people who may be prone to these actions, you cannot arrest and detain people before they have done something. I don't have the answers, but I'm interested in the discussions! The knee-jerk reaction is to lock them up and throw away the key - that's not solving the problem, it's just shutting it away - and for most people that's enough. But for me, it's the start. Regrettably there is not enough help available right now for families who have worries about one of their offspring - that only happens when it's too late!",We Need to Talk About Kevin
129,kevinmorice,Too confused for it's own good,5,30 December 2012,"Tilda Swinton is great and she scores all 5 of the marks I gave this film. But the rest of it is a confused mess.Tarantino's one and only gift to modern cinema is to popularise fractured story telling. Unfortunately the success of his movies has given every idiot with a script the idea that they can chop up their movie and it will be stylish and cool while covering up holes in their characters or storyline. Once again this is clearly shown not to be the case.The characterisation and the premise for the story is flawed from the start. There is no explanation, rhyme or reason behind the sheer evil of the eponymous child. Without an understanding of the child it is difficult to empathise with the parents for their subsequent lack of parenting skills.There is no explanation for why the parents allow his behaviour to continue without acting or reacting, or without seeking help. He acts out as a child and no-one reacts. He kills his sister's hamster and no-one reacts. He blinds his sister and no-one reacts. Casting John C Reilly is also a gaffe as you keep waiting for him to say or do something stupid, or for Will Ferrel to jump out.There are some attempts at philosophical statements thrown into the script, but they are just driven over by the confusing train-wreck of a story. Fat people are always eating, people on TV are just watching people on TV, some of those could have been turned into full scenes or decent story points but they are just thrown away.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
130,DJRMewzique,"Disturbing, brilliant, and robbed of Oscar nominations.",9,12 February 2012,"Touted as the ""feel-good movie of the year"" by those who are most sarcastic, ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" could not be further from the truth.Golden-Globe-nominated Tilda Swinton, who should have been nominated for an Oscar for this performance over even Meryl Streep, plays Eva Khatchadourian, a woman who never quite connects with her son, who becomes increasingly unstable and savage as he grows older, resulting in a high-school killing spree.An absolutely disturbing film about the possible outcome of parental disconnect, ""Kevin"" is an incredibly honest and frightening look at a mother who tries to build a relationship with her son while knowing, deep down, there is really no feelings there at all. Swinton, with her facial expressions and perfect body language, is so incredibly affective and riveting as the desperate mother, both while Kevin is growing up and when we see her life after the massacre. I have difficulty finding the words to express the emotions that her performance stirs as you see how much she suffers while not understanding how a mother could give birth to a child she doesn't love.Kevin, played by three young actors who look so incredibly alike, it's almost creepy, is so compelling, whether played by a toddler named Rock Duer, a child named Jasper Newell or teenage Ezra Miller, the mere presence of any incarnation of him on screen will make your skin crawl.The film is so very affecting because most cannot imagine a situation such as this, yet the film is not supposed to be presented as a horror film. There is no supernatural evil at work here. I am sure this happens in real life, hopefully with not such a shocking and truly gruesome outcome. You watch in horror as the lack of emotion from the mother is frightening, yet when you see the actions of this child, you cannot help but have empathy for Eva, even though she almost comes across as unwillingly abusive at times. The film is set up in somewhat jarring flashbacks (which really should have received an Oscar nomination for editing) as you see a completely broken Eva dealing with the aftermath of her son's actions as she reflects on the upbringing of a child who grows into a person without feeling.No, ""Kevin"" is NOT the feel-good movie of the year. In fact, it is a difficult film to watch. You should not go see this film if wanting to leave the theatre with a smile on your face. However, as a character study, this film is one of the most affecting that I have seen in a long time, and if there is one actress who was robbed of an Oscar nomination, it is indeed Swinton, who is nothing short of brilliant.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
131,Birminghamukengland,"A Masterpiece in Direction, Acting and Story Telling.",10,4 March 2012,"I won't repeat what many others have said already about this film apart from the fact that I was gripped from start to finish. Truly awesome directing, filmmaking and flawless acting by all.Having a degree in mental health I am always on the look out for movies like these where there are many layers and one is required to contemplate and analyse each character (thank you Mike Leigh!). I was still thinking about this film for days, it stays with you.As I watched the Special Features and the cast interviews I did find it disturbing that there appeared to be a general consensus that Kevin did not suffer with a psychopathic or sociopathic disorder which may have been organic in nature. From the story telling of the film (I haven't read the book) I gleaned that he had a severe disorder which was not a result of his poor relationship with his mother or family. Yes, there were considerable areas of poor parenting, especially from the father who did not confront his behaviour and yes initially his mother didn't want him, BUT for the brilliant actor who played Kevin to say he was 'normal' is almost abhorrent.People with the most horrendous up bringing STILL know right from wrong. Kevin did not have these boundaries or refused to acknowledge them almost from birth which suggests there is something organically wrong. No normal functioning person, no matter what their upbringing was like would commit the atrocities which were so upsetting to watch at the conclusion of this movie. They would recognise how their thoughts and feelings were so out of synch with what is right and wrong and would seek help, hopefully.I am amazed this did not win an Oscar for at least the directing, rather than the awful (IMO and yes I did see it!) novelty film ""The Artist"" They were robbed!",We Need to Talk About Kevin
132,nathanschubach,Confusing parental guide on how NOT to raise children,5,8 October 2012,"I'm conflicted with the score I gave this film. I enjoyed the quality of the shots and the acting throughout the film, yet I remain deeply confused about what triggered Kevin to become so unmanageable. Tilda Swinton fits into the awkwardness of the movie like glue, her character barely knowing how to breathe in some scenes. John C. Reilly felt a bit out of place, and I hardly recall what he did to support the family. I think tighter character development could've helped with that.The focus of the movie wasn't on the characters of the movie, at all, though. The focus was on the disconnected communication between everybody. The film tries to sway you to understand the psychosis of a young boy turning into a teenage hell spawn with a weak explanation that ""there is no pointthat's the point."" Lame, if this is the writers'/director's intent.It was an upsetting watch, that's for sure. It felt like the older horror movies of the late 70's/early 80's, like an updated ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""The Shining,"" or ""The Omen."" Some viewers don't like how it didn't explain itself clearly enough, though, which is what I agree with. We live in the age of ""everything needs a rational, logical, scientific reason,"" so any omission of an answer from a film leaves some people (including myself) wanting more. Overall, though, it might intrigue those who are fine with films made for art-sake first.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
133,alexandermangoldt,"Artistically brilliant, but .",7,10 December 2011,"From an art-house point of view, this is probably one of the best films of the year. The opening sequence with throngs of people engaged in a tomato battle lends itself well to the associations we generally have when we think of the color red. Red is a color that can be considered a general theme of the movie. Later on in the movie, we see Tilda Swinton scrubbing the red paint from her porch, a quite simple but effective metaphor: There is blood on her hands, because she didn't respond appropriately to her son's weird behavior. The director also uses food in an artistic way. Throughout the entire movie we see shredded food, sandwiches with red jam turned upside down and lychees devoured by the evil son. All this to give the entire movie a notion of I don't know what, disgust maybe. This artistic take on the topic illustrates the feelings of the mother, her feeling of guilt, her inaptitude to come to terms with the tragedy and her confusion as to what really happened. Like a poem is often a better way of conveying the feelings one has regarding a particular subject matter, this movie describes the feelings of a mother whose son went on a killing spree better than a documentary probably could, but that's about it when we talk about the advantages of an artistic take on the subject matter. If, regarding this movie, we venture to take a reality check, the film has quite a few shortcomings. For example: The son goes on a killing spree at his school, however, not one single scene shows him at school conversing or interacting with class mates or teachers. The film focuses on the family and on the family only, so why does he kill his class mates? The bow and arrow massacre also is hardly credible. If a guy shot students with a bow and arrow instead of using a gun, it's hard to believe that he could manage to kill so many in a gym. After the first arrow, wouldn't the students run towards him, wrestling him down before he could take a second shot? The film also wants to make us believe that Kevin was born evil (the Play-the-ball scene), negating the fact that many of the real school shooters were ordinary children until they were bullied by their class mates so extensively that it gradually changed their personality and perception of life. And the reactions of the parents: John C. Reilly again plays a doofus character who has no clue whatsoever about what's going on in his family, while at the same time being a successful and well-off man who can afford to buy a great house and many other things. Sorry, but it doesn't wash.

134,TroyeEvans,Superb Acting Mixed With Incoherent Story,4,15 December 2011,"Here we are again, another movie that may join the Oscars race. I will say this: Even if ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" gets nominated, it will only be on account of the striking performances. The obvious and educated explanation is that this is far off the mainstream of films that the Academy often likes to recognize as Best Picture material, but the more important thing is that, there seems to be a sense of incoherence throughout.Much of the things not having been explained over the course of the plot development is not the weakness here. The real problem is that it has a feeling that contents are spread all over and there is difficulty finding relation between scenes. To be precise, depiction of Kevin's childhood was no doubt necessary, but what exactly happened? What were the key events that led to the eventual outcome? And what message was the movie bringing? It was not that confusing for me to constantly jump from point to point on the time-line, but as I said, this is not a problem. The fault is on the contents shown rather than on the means of displaying them.The start of the film produced an initial feeling that everything would be covered and you would comprehend the whole thing when it was over. So you were expecting a lot to help you understand better the two main characters as focuses - the mother and the son - which were the core of the whole film. But in the end, when you thought you had seen all the missing random (Or were they random? They seemed random to me) memories of Kevin's childhood, you still would not understand much. What was the force that drove him to do what he did? And if the reason behind his actions was not meant to be revealed, then what was the point of making it look like it was revealing something? Perhaps this is just me, but speaking of messing with the past and the present, this reminds me of ""21 Grams"". A little disappointed as I was with that movie, at least the scenes formed a more-or-less complete story.But let's also talk about the good things. The group of actors in this are incredible. This is not a movie with much long dialogue, which is even more challenging. But all the actors delivered excellent performances.Tilda Swinton was amazing and I definitely would like to find her among the five nominees as Best Actress in the Oscars. There is not a single outstanding scene or particularly intense scene for her but her overall performance from begin to finish was simply startling.Ezra Miller was equally good for his part as Kevin, and the two young versions of Kevin by Jasper Newell and Rock Duer were good too. John C. Reilly was, well, his part was relatively minor and he did not appear much.I would not be surprised if the actors in ""We Need To Talk About Kevin"" gain recognition and awards. I would be utterly shocked though if this turned out to be one of Best Picture nominees, but I guess with all the gems this year it will be highly unlikely. Anyhow, I still think the best way to describe this movie is that it is a movie with powerful acting but a weak story.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

It is not until part way through the movie that we learn what tragedy occurred to devastate her. The movie is framed as a psychological thriller as the mother (Tilda Swinton in an tour de force acting job) examines why the tragedy occurred – was it nature or was it nurture? In other words, is she to blame?Tension is maintained throughout this drama by a well-written script and the acting of Ms. Swinton. The direction (for example, overuse of the color red as a symbol) borders on a little too artsy for its own good, in my opinion, but still a movie worth seeing.Not quite a horror movie, but no doubt a horror story for any parent.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
136,georgep53,Motherhood Isn't All It's Cracked Up To Be,8,12 March 2012,"SPOILERS The debate between nature and nurture in determining human development is not a new one. Maxwell Anderson's classic play ""The Bad Seed"" raised this question during the 1950's with respect to Rhoda a fictitious little girl who appears to be a perfectly normal child but is in reality a monster. In the half century since that play science still hasn't given us a definitive answer to the question. In 2003 author Lionel Shriver explored this issue in her novel ""We Need To Talk About Kevin"" which has been turned into a chilling new movie starring Tilda Swinton as Eva a successful travel writer who isn't exactly looking forward to giving up her active, urban lifestyle for a life in suburbia and the demands of motherhood. Her relationship with Kevin is strained virtually from birth. Is Kevin a typical child acting out or is there as Eva suspects something more sinister motivating him? Her husband, Franklin, sees nothing unusual and has a far better relationship with Kevin who becomes a point of contention between them. In an interview with the BBC Shriver noted that Eva and Franklin are representative of the two opposing forces in contemporary American culture: Eva is the pessimist eager to find fault, and Franklin is the optimist who's comfortable with the status quo. Does Kevin detect this family dynamic and purposefully play one parent against the other? As Kevin grows older Eva's fears escalate in the face of his increasing anti-social behavior. The birth of her second child, a daughter named Celia who's as sweet as Kevin is hostile, does little to alleviate the family tensions as Eva fears that Kevin might be entertaining ideas about harming Celia. Swinton gives a brilliantly understated performance as the tortured Eva. This film is worth seeing for her performance alone. John C Reilly is excellent as Franklin and Ezra Miller is fittingly unnerving as Kevin. Under Lynne Ramsay's skillful direction ""We Need To Talk About Kevin"" is a harrowing piece of psychological horror.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

It was published in 2003, four years after the infamous Columbine massacre, in which two high school students, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, killed 13 people at their high school in Colorado, before turning their guns on themselves.As one of the worst school shootings in America's history, Columbine sent the US into uproar, with two firmly opposed sides arguing over what might have caused the disaster: the left insisted inadequate gun control practically placed the weapons in the teenagers' hands, while the right claimed it was violence in the media and video games which poisoned their poor little minds.Shriver's Kevin, which won the Orange Prize for fiction, no doubt owes its success to the furore Columbine sparked. It depicts Eva Khatchadourian's attempt to understand why her teenage son carried out his own school killing. However, to Shriver's credit, she approached the highly topical subject matter with care, refusing to exploit the fierce debate Columbine created. Told in a series of letters between Eva and her estranged husband Franklin, the novel transcends the issues of censorship and gun control by providing a more ambivalent exploration of the sociopathic mind.In taking this different tack, Shriver managed to avoid partisan propaganda, and Lynne Ramsay's film adaptation recreates this sense of ambivalence. Using extensive amounts of montage, Ramsay pieces together the plot in a way that perfectly mirrors Shriver's frayed epistolary mode. Yet the film's greatest achievement is its ability to make a story about mass murder seem oddly tedious.As with many novel-to-film adaptations, We Need to Talk About Kevin is faced with the difficult task of injecting some suspense into the proceedings when the audience probably already knows how it all ends. Ramsay seems content with constantly gesturing towards the story's bloody finale, and does so in exceedingly blatant ways. Not only do the interspersed scenes of Eva visiting Kevin in prison serve as a bit of a spoiler, but the colour red is simply everywhere - from the opening shots of a young Eva taking part in the Valencian tomato-throwing festival, La Tomatina, to later scenes of an eight-year-old Kevin maliciously defacing his mother's office with a Super-Soaker full of red paint.Thus it becomes pretty clear early on that Kevin is eventually going to go postal, and as a result you spend the rest of the running time waiting for the film to finally confirm it. Meanwhile, we are subjected to long and repetitive scenes of Eva trying hopelessly to bond with her sociopathic progeny, raising questions about how far her less-than- perfect parenting is to blame for what eventually happens.Ramsay has a strong visual approach, and produces a set of stunning montages, representing Eva's internal struggle to piece together Kevin's life in her mind and come to some sort of understanding about what he did. However, while technically excellent, these montages never quite compensate for the complete lack of suspense.As Kevin remarks during one of his mother's prison visits, for the public, murder is little more than another form of entertainment. And this remains the novel's and indeed the film's most prescient insight. In the wake of Columbine, many piously condemned violence in the media, but from video games to news coverage we are all fixated by tragedy. This film does well not to exploit the subject matter for a cheap, dark thrill, yet the care Ramsay takes unfortunately removes any sense of intrigue. This may well be the point, presenting us with the harsh reality behind the sensationalised treatment of murder, but as important as this message might be, it nevertheless makes for a dull watch.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

Told all out of order and already knowing the Kevin's end 'event,' I thought I knew what to expect but I was still utterly floored by what I saw. Tilda Swinton is without a doubt my favorite working actress and this film is yet another notch in a dedicated filmography. Lynne Ramsay is definitely an excellent and unrivaled filmmaker in regards to heavy subject matter and her presentation of such and the way she crafts films leaves blanks for the mind to brilliantly fill in as the story gives further and further context to each event that is placed before it because of the excellent editing work done by Joe Bini. Unfortunately due to the subject matter, I can't see myself watching the film again anytime soon but this is a very excellent piece of filmmaking and I'm quite excited (despite it probably being a downer) to see what Ramsay does next.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

142,ron-fernandez-pittsburgh,Let's talk about the flaws,3,29 July 2012,"This movie could have been good if it made any kind of sense of the characters. Nothing is really explained or gone into as far as why these people act and think and do what they do. Too much is left to the imagination. Perhaps that's what the filmmakers wanted. Three flaws that make this film almost un-watchable FLAW ONE: Spoiler alert: Why did the towns people hate her so much? She lost a husband and child as well as her son. No sympathy whatsoever by anyone. FLAW TWO: Why didn't she leave town and start anew? Because of her guilt feelings about what her son did? Because she WANTED to be made fun of? Because she was a little nutty herself? No explanation. FLAW THREE: The biggest flaw of all. Didn't she or her husband have any friends, Mother's, Father's, Aunts, Uncles, siblings? She had one brief conversation with her mother at one point, but nothing else. Didn't anyone come to her aide? The couple had no friends AT ALL...even before the tragic event? Without these flaws, WE NEED TO TALK ABOUT KEVIN would have been a pretty good film, even though the time frames were confusing at first and it WAS a bit on the 'artsy' side. The performances? Poor Tilda Swintin...nothing but a gloomy look. Looks like she walked through her role. John C. Riley was even worse. What a moronic role. I guess no one could have made heads or tails out of it. The boys who played Kevin..well, OK, but they all lacked something. Perhaps better writing would have helped.

We are simultaneously trying to watch the movie, figure out what is going on and figure out who all these people are as well as what's going on. That's a horrible way to tell a story. I assume that there is some idea of ""involving the viewer"". Well, most viewers don't want to be ""involved"", they simply want a story told that they can understand. And any good story needs a base to spring from. Add to all the already mentioned problems that this movie just wanders all over the place in time. You hardly know where you are, when you are and what's going on. So this is bad times about 6 so it will not get more than 2 stars. That's the maximum for such a mess of a movie.

144,anandrajeev979,"Dark , Twisted, Psychological thriller but with a pale direction",7,7 December 2016,"We need to talk about Kevin has shinning lead in the form of Eva played wonderfully by Swinton. First things first the movie is based on child who is I think neurologically disturbed like a sociopath or psychopath but there was no treatment given to him and due to his he did a massacre on his school students. From the start we see that Eva is unhappy with the child but then later tries to bond with him although unfruitful. There are many disturbing and irritating aspects of Behavior of Kevin and that will make you sick while watching it. After so many fruitless trials she fails in gaining her son's trust. He grew violent and finally killed his father , sister and a whole bunch of other children using a bow and arrow(he was excellent marksman). Why Kevin was like this? Or How did he turned out to be like this is given in the film although watcher can have their own meaning drawn from that. In my Opinion Kevin knew he loved his mother way too much and he wanted to stay away from her as her love will make him weak so he started despising her but she wouldn't resist so his actions grew violent as he grew bigger he put his guard down and did everything which he don't know why he did and that's why he for me is like a psychopath or sociopath. However the other theory which I suggested first is proved by the fact that during period of having period of fever he was only with her and no one else. However Eva always loved her even when he killed Eva Husband and daughter.The treatment Eva receives from society and her life turned upside down is gut wrenching to see. Even though the film excels as a psychological thriller I couldn't agree with Director's vision or portrayal . I respect the Director having his own vision and way of representation but it's not suited to me so I gave it 7/10. Also even though the film is good I do not plan on watching it again but can recommend to people only of acquired taste.

I saw Kevin as preternaturally evil, bad to the bone. Another viewer attributed his rage to maternal incompetence.John C. O'Reilly is perfect as the well meaning father who unwittingly supports his child's demise into the demonic, dismissing his wife, who is on to the kid, even up until the kid is in jail, where she predicts that his planning to be tried as an adolescent will result in his being let out, with no record.This is a topic that needs exploration.

149,srobertson-75103,Annoyingly boring --- too much idle screen time,3,23 April 2020,"In all fairness, the movie did finally come together at the end...but it just took forever to get there. The stoic face of the mother was just plain annoying and the flashbacks were confusing. I spent the majority of the time completely bored and frustrated that I was being strung along slowly and painfully.The constant moving from past to present was hard to follow and I finally realized I had to look at the main character's hairstyle to figure out what time period the film was depicting. As far as I could tell there were 4 time periods...the distant past before having Kevin...the somewhat distant past when Kevin was small...the not-so distant past when Kevin was a teenager and the present.Many things go unexplained...what was that big tomato fight at the beginning? Why didn't the parents of this troubled boy get some outside help? (- yes there were signs that this kid was going to go off the rails.) Instead all the mother did was look blankly into space whenever her kid did something odd. Yes, they needed to talk about Kevin...so why didn't they? I guess that was the point of the movie maybe?
They had the potential to make this a better movie, but the silent flat affect of the mother was so boring and annoying - I just didn't have the patience for it. You can only sit a watch a woman going about her daily life for so long before you just want to get to the point. I got really tired of her walking around, going to work, washing her face, making lunch, and rarely speaking. I wound up fast forwarding through many slow spots...and there were plenty of them.

151,badtothebono,"lousy character development, lousy character motivation, and lousy editing",3,9 March 2014,"Let's start with the Bottom Line: if you make a movie about the relationship between 2 people and one of the 2 people was a ""mature, developed"" person when the relationship began, then a) you have to explain who that person was, b) subsequent events cannot all be incongruous, & c) you cannot focus only on the relationship and completely ignore that one of the 2 people seems to have some life outside of the relationship.Lousy character development, lousy character motivation, and lousy editing (though maybe some of you would call that plot development, I don't know).Lousy character development: a) Eva was supposed to be a world-traveler who later (when? Not sure, but much later since her daughter was no longer a toddler. Why? Not sure of that either.) wrote a book about traveling the world (I guess that was the topic. We are not given any insight.). OK. We're shown nothing of this except a visit to a tomato festival in Spain and her desire to personalize her room by wallpapering it with maps. b) We're also clued in that she loves living ""in the city"", NYC to be exact, but we are also shown none of this. c) She then marries a chubby buffoon (Why? WTF knows or even seems to care.) who forces her to move to the burbs, and not just any burbs. These are likely the burbs of NYC, perhaps the most depressing burbs in the world.All this happens but we're given no reason to believe in any of it. It just happens. She just does it. It may as well be a Nike commercial. She is like a sphinx or a deer-in-headlights.Lousy character motivation: a) So, after Eva's non-existent character development, she's living with a devil-child in the deadly boring burbs. Great. Boy, to put up with this, she must really love that guy. Not. We're shown no spark or even a connection between the ""happily"" married couple. b) Well, maybe something else in the burbs fulfills her. Uh, no. For some # of years, she seems to be a stay-at-home housewife. But she is SO BUSY that she seems to make little attempt to have her devil-child properly assessed by the proper professionals, No Matter How Bad Things Get. c) She seems to get a job at some point. What is it? Who knows. Who cares. d) So, her life is about the exact opposite of what she would have probably envisioned, and there is no sign of offsetting, positive factor. So, what does she do? She sticks around and HAS A SECOND KID! Good one. e) Well, having a 2nd kid didn't improve the home-dynamic any, and now her loving 2nd kid is being terrorized by the devil-child. So, does she do anything about it? Snooooooooooooooooooore. Dems duh breaks lil girl.Lousy Editing: a) What was this book supposed to be? The film is about the character EVA. We are shown almost nothing to understand her. Then, the 2nd most notable thing she does in her life is writing this book. (#1 being raising a psycho-killer and warning nobody about him) The film treats it like a throwaway. b) What was that job she was at when she heard about trouble at the high school? What? How long did she work there? Did they have a nanny? Huh? What? Here's one of the screwed-up things, she knew he was a devil-child, the husband wouldn't believe it, so one obvious thing to do is GET ANOTHER WITNESS. Hire a nanny, get out of the house, let the nanny deal with him, then get the nanny to back you up. c) When she is coming out of court, the lawyer says ""You'll lose your business."" Huh? WHAT BUSINESS!??! Huh?And this is all before the ""climax"". What happens after the climax, just pathetic. WTF did she stay? WTF did she stay prior to having a 2nd child? WTF did she stay and keep the 2nd child exposed to such danger, exposed to such malignance and cruelty? WTF did she stay prior to the climax? And, most obviously, WTF did she stay after the climax?

152,saschakrieger,The Question That Has No Answer,10,28 March 2012,"Red: It is the color of the Tomatina festival in the Spanish town of Buñol for which every year thousands of people from all over the world gather only to throw tomatoes at each other. At the end of the day, rivers of red flow through the town as a result of this peaceful, crazy, silly spectacle. The start of the film sees Eva, an acclaimed travel writer in the middle of this harmless madness, eyes closed being carried on the hands of other enthusiasts. Lost, immersed in the moment, caught in the thoughtless, happy rapture of living. It is also the color of the paint enraged neighbors have splashed all over the facade of her house. The Eva living here all by herself is a beaten, defeated, scared, clueless woman who has no future and who might not even own her past. Between this lie almost two decades, a life lived for her children. When she wakes up seeing the red paints on her window, one child is dead, the other in prison. Left is a mother struggling to find out what happened.It is a powerful, disturbing opening. The color red becomes the leitmotif of the film. It is the red of the lights of the ambulance and police cars on the day that changes everything, not only for Eva. And, ultimately, it is the color of the blood spilled at the hands of her own son. Throughout the film we see her trying to remove the paint from her house, leaving red marks on her hands, visible symbol of the guilt she feels but cannot explain, the guilt that keeps returning like the color on her hands. The red lights reflected in the car window as the bewildered Eva makes her way towards a scene she cannot expect to find, the barred red doors behind which the tragedy takes place, the blood, the paint, the tomatoes: all elements of the same stories, elements which do not seem to belong together just as the different parts of Eva's life don't become one, do not seem to make any sense. And over all of this the desire, no, the necessity to find meaning, the only chance to maybe be able to go on. Somehow.We need to Talk about Kevinis, first and foremost, a film about a search: the quest to come to terms with what happens, to try and understand how it happened, how it came to this, a painful quest to find out one's personal guilt. It is not only a film about this search: In its structure, its rhythm, its aesthetics, the film is this search. We watch, we feel, we hear Eva's process of dealing with the unthinkable, the unbearable. The flashbacks, the memories, the fluid sense of time in which past and present flow into one another, are inseparable, are born by this process, are this process. There is a sense of instability here, in the storytelling, the camera, the editing, which reflect the instability of the protagonist, of this woman who has lost everything, has been ostracized, is openly stared at and even attacked in public, who moves along like a zombie, bewildered, lost, more dead than alive.This might be the best performance in Tilda Swinton's career. Her face, stern, harsh, increasingly desperate, tells her story, it is the battlefield on which the tragedy happens. She carries the film from her hopeful beginnings all the way to the numbness, the paralysis which entraps her after the downfall. All the contradictions, the loose ends, the conflicting emotions which do not make any sense – they are here, in this face, this rigid body. This heightened state of confusion which has taken over her life – it can be felt, almost touched by the viewer. She has a major role in creating the stifling atmosphere of the film, an unsettling mixture of fear, incomprehension, desperation, confusion. At times the film has an almost dreamlike feel as Eva moves along in some sort of troubled trance. It return, harsher, colder, when Kevin embarks on his destructive mission. Perhaps this is her trying to picture it, trying to grasp what happened, perhaps all she has to do so is the logic, the mock reality of the dream.Is she the victim or is she the one to blame? This is her question and as she tries to answer it, the focus moves towards her son Kevin, or rather their uneasy relationship. He was a strange child, apparently without affection for his mother, a psycho- or sociopath in the making, highly intelligent as well as manipulative, openly hostile to his mother and contemptuous towards others, maybe even himself. There is little development here, Ezra Miller portraits Kevin in an almost hermetic way, as something of a black box, inscrutable, inexplicable. Where do the contempt, the coldness, the hatred come from?Eva has no answer and neither has the film. ""There is no point. That's the point"", Kevin says after being questioned by Eva when she discovers that he is collecting computer viruses as a hobby. We Need to Tak about Kevin does not try to explain why teenagers, or people in general, end up doing terrible things. There are countless questions but no answers. At the very end, in their final conversation, as Kevin faces his imminent eighteenth birthday and the transfer to an adult prison,there appears to be a tiny crack in his facade, in which something like fear, emotion, empathy might show. Ist there hope or is this an illusion, too? The film ends with the overriding question of ""Why?"". ""I used to think I knew"", Kevin answers, ""but now I'm not so sure.""http://stagescreen.wordpress.com",We Need to Talk About Kevin

High praise must go to all the main players.The three actors who portray the demented teenager, Kevin, as infant, child and adolescent, convey his perverse, menacing and manipulative personality with utter conviction. Ezra Miller, as the teenage Kevin, is outstanding. The moment when Kevin, who, his mother suspects, has put out his sister's eye, picks open a grape-like fruit, places it in his mouth, and punctures it with a spray of juices as he denies any knowledge of what happened, chillingly captures his calculated sadism. The scene is acted and filmed perfectly.Tilda Swinton (I had not seen her before) is superb as the mother driven to her wit's end, and John C Reilly makes an effective foil, though looking more like a lumberjack or truck-driver than a wealthy architect (OK so my stereotypes are showing).In short, a beautifully shot and acted movie well worth seeing.(Viewed at The Cornerhouse, Oxford Road, Manchester, UK, 12.11.11)",We Need to Talk About Kevin

The random time jumps are jarring and drag you out of the story again and again. The ridiculously overdone blood symbolism spread throughout the entire film is absolutely as stupid and childish as it sounds, and right from the very first shot of the film will have you rolling your eyes at how ridiculously amateurish it is. And the soundtrack, particularly through the first quarter or third of the film, is like someone watched the ""most annoying sound in the world"" scene from Dumb and Dumber and thought, ""Oh, I know a hundred things that could top that!"" And then put them all into this film. I literally turned the volume down to almost nothing repeatedly to spare myself the auditory assault that just goes on and on to absolutely no purpose. I really feel sorry for anyone who saw this in the cinema, as I'm 99% sure I'd have walked out under those conditions. And that would have been a shame, because underneath all of this terrible film making was a good film.Another reviewer (Leofwine_draca) got things almost exactly right, and I recommend looking up that review as well. Tilda Swinton can certainly carry a scene, but she has absolutely no warmth at all, which makes it virtually impossible to actually sympathize or relate to her, which works at the beginning of the film but really lets the film down as we draw closer to the end. John C. Reilly makes it through this very serious film without embarrassing himself, but his performance adds absolutely nothing, and I can't help but think a better dramatic actor would have been a better choice. Ezra Miller and Jasper Newell are both just about perfect as the titular character though. Really well done for both of them.The story is fairly straight-forward, so I won't say much about that except that it would have been seriously improved without the constant time-jumps, the ridiculous and childish symbolism, and that awful soundtrack. One thing I will specifically praise technically constitutes a SPOILER, so if you don't already know exactly what the film is about, I suggest you stop reading. That's your SPOILER WARNING. Now here's the SPOILER: I really appreciated the writer's choice of a bow instead of a gun.

The bad boy locks all the doors and then stands in one place with his bow and arrows and shoots dozens with nobody evidently doing anything to stop him.But we don't know that at the beginning. What we get is the story of this boy's life and that of his parents and family. Now that would be very interesting if this was a documentary. If only research was done and facts presented to us so we could try to understand why some psycho would want to destroy all his associates.But a documentary it's not. It a work of pure fiction. This movie only shows us a kid that was always a schemer, a mother who doesn't like the kid after a short while, and a Dad who can't see the forest for the trees.If I'm not learning something (facts), I like to be entertained. There's nothing entertaining here for sure, and it's devoid of facts, so what can I say good about it? It's got a great sound track. A nice variety of music.A better movie is Elephant by Van Gus Sant. It's an account of Columbine covering the massacre time-line from the eyes of different people involved.

161,willwoodmill,One of the most sinister films I have ever seen,9,25 April 2016,"Light spoilers in the second to last paragraph:Has a film ever scared you? And I don't mean like it startled you, or made you shout ""don't go in there!"" at the screen. No I mean has a film ever gotten deep under you skin, and made you feel repulsed at the very idea of what was going on in the film. And again, I don't mean something gory or graphic that makes you feel sick, I mean something where the characters and events of the film are so twisted and evil that it made you legitimately frightened of the world by fictional characters. If you haven't ever felt that, and would for some reason like to, look no further than We Need to Talk About Kevin.We Need to Talk About Kevin is a psychological thriller directed by Lynne Ramsey, that seeks to portray a ""damaged"" person, and what causes them to be that way. The film tells the story of Eva Khatchadourian, (played by the wonderful Tilda Swinton) a mother that struggles with making a connection with her son, Kevin. (played by Ezra Miller) Eva is at first frustrated with Kevin, he constantly disobeys and disagrees with Eva, and yet acts perfectly fine around his father. (played by John C. Reilly) But slowly as time goes by Kevin acts stranger and does crueler things to his mother. Things get worse after Eva has another child. And eventually Eva loses all trust and respect she had for Kevin (which wasn't much) and just tries to protect herself and her family. And, don't worry I won't spoil anything without a warning, but let me just say that We Need to Talk About Kevin explores some dark and taboo subjects, including some I have never explored before in a film. We Need to Talk About Kevin is executed flawlessly. This is my first Lynne Ramsey film but if it's any indication of her skill, I can't wait to see her others. Her attention to detail is impeccable. There are so many small things, or things in the background that are horribly disturbing, and if this film was directed by someone else and they didn't include them, then the film would not be nearly as good. I lost count of how many times the film sent shivers down my spine. So since the smallest things in We Need to Talk About Kevin are terrifying, imagine how disturbing and dark it can get when it actually gets to the disturbing and dark stuff. And Ramsey's masterful control is only exemplified by the fantastic performances, Tilda Swinton is as great as she's ever been, which is pretty great. John C. Reilly is a more humorous character, but don't worry he doesn't distract from the films themes or tone he only increases them when he's juxtaposed to them. And Ezra Miller, just wow, the only other thing I had seen him in previous to this was The Perks of Being a Wallflower, so let's just say I was not expecting what I got. At only 18 years old he is able to rival the performance of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter. It is truly a performance for the ages.Some light Spoilers in the next paragraph, nothing that would ruin the movie, but if you want to go into the film knowing as little as possible, skip it.I haven't seen a film that analyzes the idea of murder as seriously or as well as We Need to Talk About Kevin, since In Cold Blood and that came out in the 60's. The idea of a film exploring such a dark subject, may be enough to turn most audiences off. It isn't just about a murder, it puts you deep inside the mind of a murderer. The film try's to answer the question why? Why do people do these things? An interesting idea for a film to explore because there no simple answer. It is very clear that the mother is somewhat to blame for what happened, because of how she treated him early in his life, but is it only her fault? ""How much blame should be put on Eva?"" The film makes you wonder but never directly answers. As I was watching the film I was very certain that Kevin was just evil, but something happened at the end that cussed me to doubt my I thoughts. And since then I'm not sure what to think, which is an insane parallel to the film actually. We Need to Talk About Kevin is one of the most horrific films I've ever seen. There were several parts where I had to look away even though nothing really that graphic was being shown on the screen. I don't know if I will ever be able to watch this film again, but I'm so glad I finally saw it. The film is a not only a technical masterpiece that is meticulously designed, but also one that will affect and disturb you on a deep emotional level. We Need to Talk About Kevin definitely isn't for everyone but if your looking for something twisted and appalling look no further then We Need to Talk About Kevin.9.1/10",We Need to Talk About Kevin

Shattered and dragging narrative, chopping the story and leaving much of the details in the undertones. Slow paced to the point of being boring. Without a doubt, one of the worst films I've ever watched. The only thing that kept me from quitting this movie midway was that I was hoping that the annoying father would be killed at some point, and I wanted to understand why the mother got all that hatred from the community.

163,showtrmp,"A brave attempt, overwhelmed by itself",5,29 April 2012,"Someone might ""need to talk about Kevin"", but what is there to say? That seems to be the point of this madly ambitious, brave, foolhardy adaptation of Lionel Shriver's book about a mother, Eva (Tilda Swinton), whose son Kevin (Ezra Miller) massacres several fellow students at his high school, just days before his 16th birthday. We learn this fairly soon; much of the first half-hour of Lynne Ramsay's film is shot in a fragmentary, time-jumping style, with nearly wordless closeups of Swinton as she wanders like the undead through her miserable new existence. Neighbors stare at her, splash red paint on her porch, and in some cases physically assault her. Her new job is low-rung office dronedom. Every time she leaves her house she's tensed in preparation for another awful encounter; when she is accosted by one of her son's surviving victims (who is in a wheelchair) and he just wants to see how she is, she's pathetically grateful. In between, she ranges in her mind over key incidents from her marriage and motherhood, trying to determine what she did (or didn't do) to produce such a monster as Kevin, and whether or not there was a point of no return.This is a strong, inherently dramatic subject for any movie. Yet, apart from a few striking moments, this is basically a fragmentary modernized version of ""The Bad Seed"", that hokey 1950s melodrama about a killer tot who was ""doomed"" genetically. Only now most of the dialogue has been taken away and replaced by ""portentous"" film-school collage effects which are more heavy-handed than speeches. The symbolic use of the color red (not exactly subtle) is used to cartoon extremes--a jelly sandwich is turned, through repetition, into a foul object. Everything is shoved into our faces; we're not allowed to interpret anything for ourselves. Yet we never learn what seems to be paramount--the nature of Kevin's crimes and their aftermath. (I don't mean they should have been depicted on screen, but there could have been a TV news update or something.) The best effects are the most underplayed, as when Eva receives a visit from two Jehovah's witnesses who ask, ""Do you know where you are going to spend your afterlife?"" ""Yes, actually, I do. I'm going straight to hell. Eternal damnation, the whole bit. Thanks for asking,"" she tosses off breezily. In another scene, she's at a holiday office party and Colin, another desk jockey who has been eying her, asks her to dance. Needled by her good-natured refusal, he leans close to her ear and whispers, ""Who do you think you are, you stuck-up bitch? Who do you think is going to want you now?""",We Need to Talk About Kevin

Not even a word is spoken about the motives behind what Kevin did. Maybe the Director wanted to leave that to the audience but it was all in the air for me.Kevin is a psychopath. His only motive is to hurt his mother no matter what - even it means he himself is going to jail for it. That is my summary of the motive behind his actions.Other than the brilliant acting throughout the film, I found the rest of the story rather bland. In a nutshell, we watch a mentally troubled child emotionally abusing his mother. That's about it. While the acting can take all the praises, I don't think the plot deserves all the amazingly positive comments it gets here.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
167,lornloxor,A disjointed and boring mess,2,29 August 2013,"I was really excited to see this movie because I thought it had a great premise. Parents trying to deal with a sociopathic child and his actions is a very topical subject and deserving of attention. But the movie shies away from showing the violence the kid is actually causing and really examining his reasons for it. He just seemed like a caricature. Why is he like this? Just a bad seed? The movie never really cares to examine him deeply at all. Lynne Ramsay should've spent more time working on the story instead of trying to make the film look all artsy with fancy shots and editing tricks. The cinematography was simply bad. Way too many long and boring shots just focused on Tilda Swinton's (Eva) blank face. We can see the pores and everything! Seems like half the movie is like this and it drags like hell. The plot is constantly bouncing from one timeline to another with little connectivity to anything and this made the movie feel really fragmented. With a movie this boring, it just gets confusing and frustrating very fast when you're struggling to pay attention to it.The plot could be interesting. Parents trying to deal with a sociopathic child is a fascinating premise but this just wasn't engaging at all. The parents behavior is inexplicable. Not once do they go to a doctor, a psychiatrist or a therapist about their son's issues. Well except when they have to set a broken bone but you get where I'm going with this. So in essence, they never really...talk about Kevin. And they really should. At one point, Eva realizes that Kevin dropped the family hamster in to the garbage disposal. You don't think this would be a time to seek some professional help? The movie is just full of moments like these where the characters act like complete and utter idiots. I just can't respect, care or empathize with pretty much anyone in this movie. I didn't even care about the acting either. Eva just has the same monotonous expression on her face the entire movie. John C. Reilly's parts in this movie were so minor that it made me wonder why they even cast him in it? Why not just get someone else if you're not going to use him? Ezra Miller was decent as the sociopathic child, I just wish the characters would've been better written and that there would've been more focus on Kevin. All in all, the movie just left me completely unfulfilled. Beautiful Boy (2010) was a much better examination of the parents' of a school killer, see it instead.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
168,MrGoodMovie,Still a need to talk about Kevin?,7,29 June 2012,"""We need to talk about Kevin"", whilst a little contrived at times, is nevertheless a tour de force of modern parenting.It is clear from an early age that there is something ""not quite right"" about Kevin and his differential attitude. He cries solidly through the day but gurgles happily for his father of an evening, and as he grows up continues to exploit the tension he can cause between his parents, playing along with a father who appears to think he can do no wrong.Tilda Swinton plays the mother with enough ambiguity for us to wonder, at times, whether she may be partly to blame for the social awkwardness of her errant offspring. John C Reilly offers up a rudderless father figure who is too detached from reality, or any sense of family responsibility, to see through young Kevin - preferring instead to let his wife cope with the real business of parenting.There does come a point in the movie (and this may depend how switched on you are - it was a fair way in before I cottoned on) when you realise that you only get to see the family together in flashbacks.And I have to say that is one of the really good things about this movie, it does build the tension well as you realise something is amiss here, and get a clue to something else awry there. You start to understand that something bad must have happened, but you're not sure what, and that is only revealed towards the end of the movie.It is the dialogue towards the end of the film that is perhaps the most revealing as the inevitable question ""why?"" is asked. The answer to that question is something along the lines of ""I'm not sure I know any more"".Is that often the case in reality? Maybe in the cold hard light of day, the man, woman, boy or girl that has committed a heinous crime comes, over time, less and less to understand the motivation for that crime, and may even start to find it quite repugnant.Is that the message in this movie? Perhaps, but the movie is broad enough and has enough depth to allow each of us to make up our own minds whether there is still a need to talk about Kevin.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

No, it has nothing to do with the theme or any violence. It's just so poorly directed it feels like a B movie in the 90s. The acting outside of Tilda Swinton is really bad. Not because anyone is a bad actor, I love John C Reilly, it's just the directing. And what is up with the Asian son without any explanation? Are we supposed to assume she cheated?

This film takes us in the skin of this woman who brought a monster in the world named Kevin which she alone can recognize for what he is and at the same time cannot refuse him all of her devotion and her hope, in other words her love. Probably for original effect, the story is presented in continual flashbacks, zigzagging between four periods of Kevin's life and consequentially, that of his mother Eva, also.

This film left me in a stupor at the end. I think I was bound to love this film. It is unlike anything I've seen before. The subject matter of nature vs. nurture is something I've always been interested in and Lynne Ramsey dissects it in such a sublime way. The entire structure of the film and how it shifts between the past and present is done with beautiful precision, leaving little room for laggy scenes that drag on for too long. It is almost as if the shifts are fragments of Eva's memories as she walks through her present life trying to piece together just what went wrong. I was glued to the screen the entire time, never has the flow felt like an issue for me. If anything, I felt that John C. Reilly was miscast, but that is where my minor quibbles start and end. It is immensely thought provoking which is why I just sat there when the credits started to roll. It hit me hard, and mostly I have to attribute it to Ramsey's solid direction of the subject matter and Tilda Swanton's complete immersion into a deeply wrecked and troubled mother, in both the present and past sections of the film. Ezra Miller has also done an outstanding job, especially during the very last scene when his simple physical acting, and visually dark tone worked harmoniously in what I think isn't any less effective than Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter in any of the scenes from Silence of the Lambs.

174,tuomas_gimli,"A disturbing, uncompromising film",7,2 December 2012,"We Need to Talk About Kevin is a film that doesn't let up and offers little comfort. Its uncompromising nature and slowly unraveling horror could be even classified as horror cinema. It's very well executed, but not without flaws.The best thing about the movie is without a doubt the acting. All the roles are played excellently, especially the child actors. But the best performance is a split between Ezra Miller and Tilda Swinton, who both play their roles as convincingly as possible. Miller's depiction of Kevin is up there with Norman Bates and Hannibal Lecter as one of the greatest movie psychopaths. Swinton shows a great ability to seem normal, yet you always see the doubt and concern in her eyes. You truly get the feeling of her being a mother who cannot believe the deeds her child has committed.The story unravels in a fashion that is at times effectively hypnotic and at others incredibly annoying. There are many jumps between time periods where only a few lines of dialogue are spoken before jumping back, and it makes them feel confusing, sometimes even gimmicky. On the other hand when it does work, it feels as if we're directly inside the main character's psyche as she thinks of times past and tries to understand what went wrong - if anything went wrong at all.For its length there is surprisingly little dialogue in this film. There are numerous scenes with only a few lines, which makes the film's visuals stand out at times. One particularly surreal sequence where the main character is driving home on Halloween through a dark neighborhood cluttered with kids trick-or-treating is definitely the movie's visual highlight. The use of different colors, particularly red, and blurry filters give the movie many visually striking scenes. On the flipside, the lack of dialogue and the fairly slow pace of the film may bore viewers. I found myself nodding off on a couple of occasions.The movie is definitely too long. It could have been anything between 10-20 minutes shorter, and it felt like dragging itself at times. But it has a great atmosphere of creeping discomfort, is at times visually very impressive and apologizes to no one. Being unapologetic is always a bonus in my book.Recommendation: If you're up for a disturbing, thought-provoking film with excellent performances and don't mind slow pacing, definitely watch it.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
175,PlugInYourBrain,We need to talk about Writer/Director Lynne Ramsay,2,21 July 2012,"I had been looking forward to this movie. Many film critics raved about it, and it stars Tilda Swinton who had some role in getting the movie made. Tilda is a great actress and only appears in outstanding movies, right? The subject sounded fascinating: parents desperately try to compensate for the sociopathic behavior of a child who grows up to do something terrible. It is a great crucible for a story, and gives us a chance to peer into the mind of such a person. It's a story that, properly told, should bring tears to any parent's eye.Sadly this movie was a major disappointment.It wasn't just bad. It was boring. The first half drags.Writer/Director Lynne Ramsay has this annoying habit of jumping between different time-lines, but the jumps are unconnected. This is not just confusing, but she kept repeating the same scenes laboring the same points. It became tedious. I think Ramsay is trying to be arty, but art is supposed to convey feeling. Instead this was boring and incoherent.After dragging through the first half the movie finally progresses, but never lives up to its title. The parents never do ""talk about Kevin"". Apart from checking his hearing as a toddler, they never seek medical or psychological help, or talk to a social worker. We never see a single teacher who, over ten years, you think might have noticed something. Relatives or friends who might comment on his behavior (and could provide a better narrative than Tilda merely looking stone-faced) are completely absent in this movie. Yes, despite Eva (Tilda's character) being a travel author and adventurer she somehow has no friends. And even when Kevin pours caustic soda in his sister's eye and sticks the family pet down the waste disposal unit the parents still don't seek help. No family is this stupid, particularly when the safety of another sibling is at stake.Books that sell tend to have solid stories, so movies adapted from them don't have a problem with plot holes. Ramsay instead omitted many of the book's explanations and introduced the plot holes on her own accord:She has the townspeople vilifying Eva to the point she can't walk down the street without being slapped. But Eva lost her husband and daughter too. I don't think an entire town would be that heartless. If everyone hates her and she is that miserable there, then why doesn't she just move? She goes from being a wealthy author in a huge house to living in a miserable shack with a menial job. Why? There is no explanation. I've assumed for this review that Kevin is a sociopath, but you wouldn't know from the movie because they never go anywhere near these subjects.Ramsay appears to be squeamish or chose not to sensationalize the violence, because there is very little blood and almost no violence. Those scenes where something does happen are so heavily edited you might not even realize it. The school massacre at the end of the movie is so heavily edited it looks like Kevin is standing in an empty stadium shooting arrows into thin air. At the end she finally does show Kevin's father and sister dead, at which point I wondered why she edited the earlier violence to the point of incoherence. If you are making a movie about violence, then be prepared to show it. If for whatever reason you choose not to, then at least don't include the violent scenes with the violence cropped out of it. People either look, or they look away. If they look, they look at what is going on. By trying to do neither Ramsay's result simply ends up looking like bad camera-work; like a wildlife documentary not filming the lion but the patch of grass 30 feet to the right of them.The book apparently gives a lot of background which Ramsay left out. In the book Eva resents baby Kevin for bringing an end to her adventurous lifestyle, but the movie only hints at this. (The truth is this happens to all parents, and we deal with it.) Likewise that baby Kevin's constant crying shows there something is wrong with him. (Again, this affects all parents. Again, we deal with it.) Why doesn't Eva ever talk to her mother, who is supposedly just a phone call away? These sort of errors make me wonder if Ramsay has any children of her own, or consulted parents when she was writing the movie.Some have praised the acting, but I wouldn't. Tilda, usually a great actress, wears the same stone-faced expression. Ezra Miller looks mean and sneers, but it would be unfair to blame the actors because they are given nothing to work with. I'm not sure if John C. Reilly is necessarily miscast as Eva's husband, but there is no chemistry between Tilda and he.Except for the minor role of Kevin's sister, the characters in this movie do so many stupid things it is impossible to empathize with them. This film is a missed opportunity. It had good source material, a great actress and an intriguing concept. Ramsay should have spent more time on the story and less time choosing out-of-place songs to play over Ms. Swinton's driving scenes.This movie's fatal shortcoming isn't that it is bad, because even bad movies can be entertaining. It's problem is that it is boring. Special credit to film critic Mick LaSalle of San Francisco Chronicle who called this movie for the bore it is. Most other movie critics were taken in by it and praised it as art.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
176,toby-brace,Excellently disturbing,8,6 August 2014,"We need to talk about Kevin, and we refers to society as a whole. There is a kind of taboo about child psychopaths. Nobody wants to admit that they even exist. But they do. Tilda Swinton does an excellent job of portraying the dreadful paradox she is faced with. She wants to love her child, yet her rational mind is drawing the inescapable conclusion that he is a monster. What DO you do when you suspect your child is simply evil? There is no help forthcoming. The Father doesn't want to hear it. She is alone with her misgivings. It is actually very annoying that she does nothing. In that sense, she is partly complicit and the outrage and hostility towards her by the townspeople is partly justified. If you have brought a monster into the world, it is your responsibility to at least warn people. She does not. Everybody pays. It is a frightening and credible scenario.

177,votesmall,We Need to Talk About why this movie is all about style and no substance,5,10 April 2013,"My mother rented this movie because she thought it would be a scary movie. I watched it with her, although I had reservations as soon as I saw the title. Movies about the one psychotic child have always had excellent titles, like The Omen, The Bad Seed, or Rosemary's Baby, but this title was bland and unimaginative. It sparked no interest in me and rather seemed to be the title of a screwball comedy about parenting. And maybe this is a nitpick, but it wouldn't bother me so much if they actually TALKED ABOUT KEVIN! The dad is totally clueless. The mom knows of Kevin's true nature, but does she try to convince anybody? Nope. She just waits until a massive tragedy happens. Hmm, maybe if you had actually talked about Kevin, this wouldn't have happened. While watching the film, I noticed that the entire perspective was told through choppy flashbacks. For the entire first half of the movie I had no idea what was going on. This film is trying to be artsy and further the director's (who also wrote this piece of trash, shocker!) career. I absolutely loathe films that do this. They don't focus on the story, only how interestingly complex they can tell the story. And this doesn't further the story, it only muddles it, because you're too distracted by the direction style and wondering why this director hasn't done more for herself. I quote from the director's Wikipedia page: ""They (her films) are low on dialog and explicit story exposition, and instead use images, vivid details, music and sound design to create their unsettling worlds."" This proves my point. It's trying to be artistic, not tell a story. There are reviews who say that this film is a portrait of a deteriorating mind, but it isn't. This film portrays Kevin as bad to the bone from the day he is born, which is not only preposterous, but also proves that this film knows nothing about what a deteriorating state of mind is. You aren't born insane, nor do you become insane overnight. It takes years of pressure on a fragile person. I guess you could argue that Kevin has Asperger syndrome, but this is not elaborated on. Also, a child with bipolar disorder or Asperger's does not hate one parent but love the other. This just proves how random and confusing this film is. It isn't trying to portray a deteriorating mind-frame, it's trying to exploit it, portraying Kevin as ""evil"" from day one.Let's compare this to a favorite of mine, The Shining. The character of Jack Torrance isn't portrayed as evil, just an unhappy man who is fed up with his uneventful life. The Shining doesn't create a madman, it reveals him. He's already half-crazy, he just needs the final push. In this film, the kid is crazy from day one. No development, no questions, no hints to why, just crazy. And this film expects us to buy that. The Shining is grounded in reality, which makes it so unsettling. There is a part in The Shining where Jack talks to his son about how much he loves him, but you know he doesn't. They are just cold, empty words without affection. That is truly disturbing, and simple atmosphere-driven scenes like that are really what portray a mind unraveling. This film has none of those complex and disturbing scenes. Just pretentious scenes of a mother worrying about her son. That isn't scary or tragic. It's just boring and further proves my point about how this movie isn't trying to accomplish anything new. The director apparently feels that she can just rehash an old story without caring about how it turns out, just as long as it's cool to watch, right? The Shining was a landmark in visuals as well, but here's the difference between the two eerily similar films, The Shining actually uses these visuals to its advantage. They have something to do with the story, they further the atmosphere. The visuals in this film, while thought-provoking, do nothing for the story at all. Like I said, they're just there to look cool. Nothing more, nothing less. If you really examine how much development the mother and son characters have, it is little to none. This film isn't about them, now, is it? It's about how interestingly we can PORTRAY their relationship in shambles.I loathe this movie. An interesting premise that is both tragic and harrowing, that is completely undermined by a weak script and a self-important director. If you like psychological thrillers like The Shining or Session 9 that TRULY exist to explore a deteriorating mind-frame, skip this. It doesn't even try to deliver on that, and only exists to further its own conceited ""style"". This is more of an exploitation film about bad seed children than a study of them. I only give this a five because of the masterful acting of Tilda Swenton and Ezra Miller as the two leads. They do the best they can with a weak script, and John C. Reilly even manages to give a realistic and surprisingly serious performance. Kudos to the acting. The rest is artistic garbage that tries to be a subtle and unnerving, but falls flat on its face.I agree with critic Richard Brody, who said it: ""masquerades as a psychological puzzle but is essentially a horror film full of decorous sensationalism.""",We Need to Talk About Kevin
178,zadkine,We need to talk about the father,4,8 June 2012,"So that thing that hopped out of the chest in ""Alien"" was named Kevin? This is one creepy film, hard to watch at times, but riveting. It's strangely one-dimensional with a simple answer to all that's wrong with the world. Men. Every male is frightening/threatening in one way or another. And no one knows how to better portray an overwhelming dread of men than Tilda Swinton. Her technique is straightforward: The closer she gets to a man (or boy) in this film, the more she looks as if she's drowning. Or suffocating. Her first smile in the movie is when she's with her young daughter, and it's only with her that she's comfortable. And the father? He's oblivious to Kevin, oafish, a boor, and oddly sinister. While reviews point out the similarities between mother and son, and there are many, I think the director suggests someone else is really to blame for all of this - Dad for Kevin, men for, well, everything else.

So, since it never happened in the movie , let's talk about Kevin. Why does he act like such a little douche literally since birth? No reason is given in the movie, not even a supernatural Satan-spawn type thing.

In fact, the story played out beneath my expectations... and I unfortunately felt that my time had been wasted. I know it's not supposed to be a feel good movie. I like how it asked the question, ""how far would you go to continue to love your child"" - intriguing! However, so much more could've been done with this movie. There was no twist. As well, I find it EXTREMELY tough to believe that a 16yr old COULD hold a school hostage with a bow and some arrows. Sure, I can see him maybe getting one or two... but how easy would it be to tackle a 16yr old kid with JUST a bow? Sorry. Good idea, good concept, uninteresting execution. Didn't like it at all!

Tarantino shows us violence with dispassion, so we get the sense of just how senseless violence is. SAme could be said of Scorcese's outings, in a more digestible way, if you will.This film is perfect in that sense, and what really adds to it is the way it is shot. I have not seen such meticulous cinematography in a long time. MAny kudos to the crew here and the director for giving a vivid visual side to a story that is in fact quite cerebral, and almost untellable.Not one bad performance, either, from Swinton down to the extras. The sense of quiet alarm, of self-reprisal, of sheer frustration is expressed by Swinton exquisitely. The part of Franklin, the dad, is key to the whole deal and is featured at the exact right moments.For such a horribly disturbing film, this comes off like clockwork.

Ms. Swinson gives us a snapshot of the mothers of the boys of Columbine, and all of the other mothers who have had sons lose it and punish the innocent when minds are twisted in uncontrollable knots. Movies like this have been done before, but perhaps with a different emphasis, on the action, on the victims, on the corrective measures.

What a let down it was...Disjointed flow, poor casting for young kevin, and annoying plot points. The moral of the story is totally ambiguous. In fact, it may not have a moral or a point or a clear tone. In the film, the Mother, who is coldly played by Tilda Swinton, asks Kevin ""what's the point of collecting that item"" his response is ""there is no point"". To me that sums up this movie. There is NO point. Is it a story of nature vs nurture ? Will a seemingly evil and malicious child commit atrocities or does it take a cold, selfish mother to push him over the edge? Perhaps it's a perspective on guilt? I'm really not sure.Again, there is no point and the performances which are not bad can't atone for a multitude of missteps.

187,diaju_vampprincess,I love the movie but a big plot hole there..,7,14 May 2018,"Well, i do love the movie, but not a kind of movie i will watch twice.
The movie was captivating. The acting, the cinematography, the ambience, all is packed in a great way. Even the plot-jumping will not confuse the audience. But i give the score 7 stars out of 10 because the climax is not climax. The story is about a mother, Eva, who has no bond with her son, Kevin, but it's not written why. From the first time Kevin were born, Eva seems stressful. Perhaps she's not ready, or she just doesn't know how to handle baby because she was not expecting him. But we can't say that Eva hates him instead Kevin does. In fact, as the time goes, all we know that Eva keeps trying to love her son, but Kevin hates her still. It is obvious from the way Kevin looks at her, his behaviour is always against her, his manipulating act in front of his father, and he doesn't want his mother happy.
One time when Eva tried to teach and play with Kevin, Kevin did something that made Eva lost her patience, and threw Kevin against the wall and broke his arm. Instead of crying, Kevin just looked Eva in hateful. But Kevin kept his revenge plan only for himself, telling it was his fault that broke his arm to the doctor and to his father. But later, he used the scar to threaten his mother.Eva knows something is wrong with Kevin, but everytime Eva tries to talk to her husband, he keeps thinking Eva is exaggerating.When Kevin's sister, Celia, is born and she is the reason for Eva to be happy, Kevin starts to show some violence act, like killing Celia's pet and injuring Celia's eye. 
This one scene is the first point i feel disappointed. A big hole when they didn't show what happened to Celia's eye, the scene jumped into a time where Eva and her husband sit in a hospital outside Celia's room without telling what has happened. Only after they're having dinner with Kevin and Eva confronts him that Eva will lose her eye because he didn't look after her. If we do not read the book, or the reference, we would not know that it is apparently Kevin poured some cleaner to Celia's eye.The story keeps growing about how Eva and Kevin's relationship as mother and son is not going well, even when Eva keeps trying to have a bond with her son by having a quality time together. But Kevin keeps ruining it. He did all what he had done only to resent his mother.And then when Kevin finally commit the massacre of his school friend, which is supposed to be the climax, i just got more disappointed. Not only they didn't show the massacre -only the bodies after- but a big plot hole here. How on earth did Kevin gather all of the living victims to the hall and make them as a target for his archery skill? By sedating and dragging them? Or by inviting them? Did he tied them onto the wall? Why didn't they fight back? I mean, the victim is not only one and some of them are not helpless women/men.
I can not answer it. 
And that big plot hole ruins a beautiful and brilliant-themed movie that makes me decide to give only 7 score.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

The movie jumps back and forth on the time line for seemingly no reason, which makes it confusing and you have to use a lot of mental effort to keep the story straight. I don't mind a few flashbacks but when every 5 seconds you are jumping to a different part of the time line, it's just annoying. I liked it in Memento, but there it had a purpose (I think, to get you in the same mental state as the character: what's going on?).(Hint; to tell which time frame you are in, look at her hair length).Other than the artsy jumping around, there's not much to it. A really bad boy gets worse and worse. Slow moving, depressing, no point.And, as other reviewers mentioned, plot holes: why didn't she just move? There is some side show at her new job that had little relationship to the story.The ending was very unbelievable.

It is easy to guess it right at the beginning of the film, but we just don't know at the start to what extent Kevin's craziness has gone. I hated every minute of this movie, and even then, I have to say it's a must-seen film. Because the story, which will make you feel awful, is incredibly harsh, but well told. Unfortunately, I don't think it was necessary that Lynn Ramsay used so much effects (music unrelated with what's-going-on-scenes, long close-ups on rotten food, grinning youngster, etc.) to obtain what she was looking for: to force us to decide (or not) hating this kid, his mother, his father. John C. Reilly is playing another dumb-but-funny character he has done several times. He's not at his best here, but hopefully, Tilda Swinton his helping him in several scenes. It's a shame she didn't get an Oscar nomination for her performance. She's so great in this that it'll be hard to see her in a bad film in the future.

193,GuRUCLANdotcom,The irony in the title...lol,7,23 March 2018,"I thought I was going to be watching an Omen type typical horror movie. Couldn't really tell from the wardrobe and the way cars and things looked what year it was...looked like it took place in the 90's since no one had a smart phone at any point.Anyway.... I digress.... LOL. Overall I found the movie entertaining. Some questions weren't answered. The pacing had me super anxious for the story to unfold...what the hell was up with Kevin??? What did he do? The soundtrack was unsettling to a little annoying. There were no jump scares or horror movie music hat tricks that let you sense what's about to happen or take note of something. Aside from random folk songs here and there the movie is utterly quiet.OK...so spoiler time.At some point in the film i'm like okay... When TF are they going to have the ""we need to talk about Kevin"" conversation???? And then I laughed to myself,.....and thought...""ah-ha! Never happened"" therein lying a huge part of the problem.One reviewer wrote, that he thought it was stupid because no child is born evil, and no parent wold have handled a child who behaved this way so poorly. I beg to differ and offer examples such as Jeffrey Dahlmer, who was quoted as saying, ""I had a normal loving childhood, my parents are not to be blamed for what I have done.... I am just evil."" And don't even get me started on what could lead a child to execute any number of the mass school shootings that seem to occur monthly here in the United States. A child, aside from being exceptionally smart, can be atypically cold, unsympathetic, calculating and cruel but the question is why? Quite frankly, there is such a thing as poor parenting due to lack of experience, common sense, priorities, coping skills, selfishness and denial. Newsflash... just because a person is capable of producing a child doesn't necessarily mean they should given certain circumstances.There was definitely some serious and obscure hard to pin point problems with Kevin. He wasn't autistic, but it was something not to far off like maybe Asberger's Syndrome. His mental problem apple didn't fall far from its tree. When this movie ended I turned around and watched it again looking a bit closer for the answer to my unanswered questions.It was clear that the mother was not thrilled with this pregnancy. They say normally a woman glows, it is an amazing experience yada yada yada, but this clearly wasn't Mommer's experience. The birthing experience didn't seem to go well at all, and immediately after Kevin's born, she appears to be suffering from postpartum depression) which develops in a lot of women after child birth.It seems while Kevin was a very tiny baby and small child Mommer didn't cope well with or ever bond with Kevin. In Kevin's defense, a baby can't have a personal vendetta against someone.....or could he???? LOL.And honestly after looking at again.... Mommer was definitely off a little herself as far as having traits that Kevin exhibited, lack of emotion, sympathy, and she was also reluctant to communicate. No normal person could have dealt with the aftermath the way she did. Mommer completely failed Kevin as there was at no point any outreach for help, therapy or intervention of any kind. She had the money, which meant she could have easily obtained those resources for Kevin.Mommer and Kevin both seemed to resent each other but it seemed to me she began to resent him while still in the womb. Maybe that feeling during the early life stage played a huge and detrimental part in Keven's early childhood development. Maybe that's when those seeds were planted.Maybe his behavior was a little payback for never feeling loved.Kevin at an early age was very intelligent and calculating having the upper hand on Mommer. No parent should let a child assume the role of telling the parent what to do and the parent be looking to the child for direction and approval. That routine proved to be a huge disservice to Kevin and everyone else in the wake of his final epic act of detachment.I think there are a lot of little ""Kevins"" brewing in today's society from a combination of any number of anti-personality disorders be it from poor genetics, subjectively poor environment or poor parenting skills.The only thing I didn't quite get was why the community with the exception of one wheelchair bound kid from the neighborhood had no sympathy for Mommer in the the aftermath. The story wasn't developed enough to know why they felt she was directly responsible for Kevin's actions aside from giving him the opportunity to be born. I mean hay, I would assume that any kid that does what Kevin enacted was somehow failed by his parents, but I don't know, maybe people would react this way?Maybe that's something we could never know unless we found ourselves being in a perfect storm situation like Mommer. No one really knows what it's like for the parents of these kids who have committed these types of atrocities after the 10 o'clock news has moved on to the next big story. These people may still have to live in their homes, go to their jobs, deal with looks, whispers, assumptions and accusations from their neighbors and locals in the community who haven't so quickly forgotten. Especially survivors, and friends and relatives of the recently dearly departed victims.Anyway....this was definitely a march to the beat of a different drummer type film in a lot of ways, but it was an interesting piece of entertainment.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
194,TheDoomSong,An emotional thriller not without flaws,7,14 February 2012,"""We need to talk about Kevin"" is an uncomfortable and disturbing film about a mother-son relationship that stays with you after watching it but is sometimes too vague and suffers from too much editing.I haven't read Lionel Shriver's novel and thus cannot evaluate Ramsay's approach in terms of faithfulness to the source material. Nonetheless ""Kevin"" is a success on many levels. Ramsay refrains from using clichés to establish Kevin's character and instead focuses on the complicated relationship between the (severely) disturbed son and his overchallanged mother. Tilda Swinton once more delivers an exceptional performance. I sympathized with her as I watched her getting no love and recognition for her efforts in raising the kid and could understand her building frustration, anger and even hatred when it gets clearer and clearer that her son does everything in his power to undermine her and manipulate those around her.However, a couple of this bothered me about this, otherwise very well crafted, movie. The editing feels contrived as it mixes past, presence and future too violently and without explicit reason. It takes away from the impact of the building disaster and almost feels like it was installed to distract. A couple of plot points in the movie were left too vague and could have been made clearer while at the same time the mother's story after the catastrophe could have been trimmed down a little. The mother-son relationship should have been put even more into focus instead of focusing on the character of the mom alone. Lastly I found John C. Reilly (whom I adore as an actor) miscast. His role is underdeveloped (for a reason) and you cannot help but expect something more from him. He is underchallanged and could have been replaced by a lot of faceless, or at least less talented actors.All in all, ""Kevin"" is still a good and powerful movie, that will touch you, most likely disturb you and if you are young and are thinking about having kids, will make you think twice.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

This was pushed into our faces constantly.The second thing I disliked about this film - was the constant shifting back and forth from present to past.That people would be so lacking in any compassion or sympathy for the mother amazed me. I felt very sorry for her - from the time the son was a baby. For reasons that eluded me, the son seemed to always hate the mother, but liked the father; well, actually, I suppose as he was capable of liking anyone. I'm not really certain he even liked his father.A shocking film that was pretty much ripped from today's headlines - given all of the similar crimes that have taken place in the USA, recently; although I understand it is based on a novel. The ending is perhaps as shocking as anything in the film.It would have earned a much higher rating from me if not for the constant red and the constant back-and-forth between present and past.

199,Boris_Day,"Style over content take on the ""evil child"" horror film.",6,21 November 2011,"I haven't read the novel, so I have no idea how this compares. The film looked and sounded beautiful, but I really wanted a bit more in terms of characterisation and psychological insight. The film is no more than an art house take of the ""evil child"" horror picture, without the camp pleasures of an Orphan or The Omen. Tilda Swinton, never the most naturalistic of actresses, has been much praised for her performance and does her best but I didn't quite buy this beautifully alien looking creature as a suburban wife and mother and she is almost grotesquely mismatched with John C. Reilly's doofus husband. I think she did a better take on a similar character in the little seen Deep End, where she played a mother who has to come to terms with the actions of a son who she suspects to be murderer.Apart from her character, the other players are paper thin. We have to take it on faith that like Damien, her son was simply born evil. Reilly is like any horror movie goon and ridiculously non-perceptive about the bad seed in his family. Almost everybody else in the film is there to torment Swinton's guilt ridden mother. I'm also rather tired of the by now overused movie device of scrambling up the time line of events, feeding us little bits of information here and there to build up to a series of reveals. In a case like this there is something almost exploitative in teasing us with various horrors to come, especially in the case of the younger sisters eye injury. I think that the film would have benefited from a chronological progression. It's fine when done well (like in the recent Red, White and Blue), but here I just thought ""not again"" as the film started in a self-consciously disorientating manner. The film looks beautiful but it's as stylised as a 70s Dario Argento film with expressionistic lighting and cinematography, but at least Argento films like Suspiria didn't ask to be taken seriously and can be taken purely as exercises in style. This struck me as an ultimately empty film with little to say. It's a shame because the subject matter of a mother who just can't love her child has great potential.

I had big problems with this movie.If you want to see endless shots of Tilda Swinton wandering around like a glassy-eyed zombie, you're in for big thrills.I was intrigued by the basic theme of a child who shows signs of being a sociopath, but it has virtually no discussions whatsoever of its parents trying to figure out what is happening. Instead, we watch them make love as if things are normal.The film has a certain technical expertise. The non-linear storyline is a challenge, however. Thirty minutes in, I had had quite enough, but I stayed with it.We get the sense that a massive atrocity has been committed, but we don't find out what it is, of course, until the very end. I blame Robin Hood and I blame two parents who do not seem to have a clue about disciplining a wicked child. Their passiveness in the face of grotesque behavior upset me (and my wife) as much as the antics of the little monster they spawned.The use of music was really weird, especially Buddy Holly's ""Everyday"" that makes not the slightest bit of sense.I cannot recommend this movie. I think the average viewer will be bored witless and probably will not make it to the finale.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
202,My_Opinion-245-920801,Movies such as this are extremely difficult to write a review on because there are so many variables layered into it,6,27 December 2011,"We Need to Talk About Kevin is the type of movie that near or at the actually ending you throw your hands in the air and say, what just happened. What I am referring to is the flash backs along with a fractured plot that is not all that well written. This is a fictional school massacre, written by Lynne Ramsay and Rory Kinnear it is loosely based off of Lionel Shriver award winning Orange Prize author's book of the same title. The precept for this book was established by Lionel Shriver although that is not the direction this movie took. The scenes in We Need To Talk About Kevin were splintered, difficult to follow and absorb. The events leading up to the character of Kevin, Ezra Miller placing *Spoiler* a hamster in the garbage disposal is minimal touched upon. Thus we cannot as an audience quite understand the transformation from a child, albeit ill-mannered child into a full blown sociopath. If the audience is to fully absorb what is taking place in a movie of this caliber with such a tricky and sensitive plot, it was unwise to leave out the details and circumstances that lead this child to becoming a disturbed teenager. Bypassing that the acting on the part of Ezra Miller, as Kevin was sensational to say the least dark, brooding, introvertbut like most sociopaths very intelligent. Tilda Swinton and the rest of the cast were spot on. Movies such as this are extremely difficult to write a review on because there are so many variables layered into this piece of art and after all is said and done or in this case written all art is subjective is it not.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
203,LovePythons,Fascinating - but only on speed dial,5,4 June 2012,"I knew little about this film before I watched it (On Demand at home). Thank goodness I could fast-forward! Why all those long silent empty scenes that happen with numbing regularity? I finally figured out that if you count to five slooowly, someone will then speak. But it's so irritating! The visual delights were interesting but made little sense. Halloween masks make suburbia frightening? The parts I related to were the scenes between the mother and Kevin. Poor lady - she didn't have a clue about motherhood. She both tried too hard and withheld too much. She was pretending to love the kid and he knew it. He also was a rotten kid.P.S. you parents out there: letting your kid boss you around and setting no limits will definitely lead to an antisocial kid or at least a real pain in the neck.I'm glad I didn't know the ending and I won't reveal it.

204,thelastjedi_good,"Pessimistic, dark, and often tough to watch, this is a well-made movie",9,6 October 2016,"""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is not a movie that would appeal to a general audience. When the credits roll, the viewer feels pretty bad. Despite its lack of appeal, the movie is incredibly clever and paints a horrifying picture that is more relevant in today's political world than ever.This movie tells the story of a woman named Eva and her son, Kevin. Eva gets pregnant by mistake at a young age. She stays with the father, and their son grows up to be a problem child. He is smart, conniving, and manipulative, and he does whatever he can to make Eva's life a living Hell. This terror builds up to a climactic final act of violence.Perhaps what the movie does best is making things feel real. When Kevin and his mother bicker with each other, their arguments always feel human. All of Kevin's schemes seem grounded; he projects himself as a happy and loving child to his father, while secretly torturing his mother. When Eva protests to her husband, he sides with the boy, as he has never seen Kevin's evil side. This whole dynamic seems sickeningly real. The viewer understands what Kevin's evil intentions are, and how Eva is helpless in his wake.The narrative in the film is presented out of sequence. Parts appear before Kevin's violent act, and other parts appear after. It is presented like a fever dream of bad memories going on inside Eva's head. This out-of-sequence style presents Kevin's terrors very effectively by juxtaposing different events in different years directly against each other. The editing also manages to never leave the viewer too confused as it goes along.This movie also shows impeccable attention to detail. Director Lynne Ramsay really nails it with smart visual metaphors. For example, after the day of violence, Eva is constantly washing red paint off of her house, but it never seems to come off. There are many examples of metaphor like this, some more subtle than others. This film was certainly made with intense care from the director, and it shows.The performances in the film are very good as well. Swinton is given one thing to emote for two hours: despair. She does a pretty good job with it too, communicating the depth of her pain seemingly at all times. The best performance in the movie probably comes from Jasper Newell, the child actor who plays the grade school version of Kevin. This child actor is able to embody the fiendish kid in a way that is almost eerie.In all ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" is a great movie. It may not leave you feeling optimistic, but it is remarkably well crafted and it tells a story that is dark, politically relevant, and gripping.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
205,ernestoac,We need to talk about this movie,9,30 April 2020,"A movie that, at first had me kind of dizzy between all the jumps in time it has, but eventually started to tie all together making up an impactful story in which we might not get all the answers we are looking for, just like our characters.
Maybe the movie is a little complicated and difficult to understand, and can have different perceptions.
Maybe we won't understand the reason why Kevin (Ezra Miller) is the way he is, maybe there is no reason, but we will feel the way Eva (Tilda Swinton) handles this relationship.
Kevin just seems to have been against his mother since birth, as the movie shows, this may be influenciated by how this movie takes place from Eva's memories and therefore her perception, but he undoubtly has been against her since he could reason, we don't know why, but it will be taken to really high levels, maybe too high, as he develops an ""evil"" so big we don't even know if he is doing all of this for his mother or is now just doing it with intensions only he can understand.
On the other hand, Eva is our protagonist, the whole movie is based on her perception, her memories, what she is facing, we see her not knowing what to do, what to expect, how to react, she is the one we will know the most.
Maybe my review is a little complicated, strangely structured and difficult to get, but so is the movie, and it is worth a try.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

208,kinseydude,"well-acted, tough to watch, questions left open",8,9 April 2012,"We Need to Talk About Kevin is very well-acted and unfolds in stunning cinematography, such that the cold beauty of the film almost distracts you from the unlikeable characters and the emotionally wrenching conflict they're caught up in. Tilda Swinton, who's even better here than in ""Michael Clayton,"" copes with life before, during, and after her son has gone on a killing spree (all three time-frames overlap and partake of flash-backs and flash-forwards). Once we understand what is going on (and that takes a while: the opening sequence is deliberately disorienting), we understand that Tilda's character is picking up the pieces of her life and moving on, while also repeatedly asking herself where she went wrong as a parent, if she is to blame for her son's psychopathic maladjustment, and if the other parents in her community are in some sense right, to blame her for her son's murders. The tone rings true, in that the movie realizes parents' worst nightmares, and in that most parents give second-thoughts to their missteps and petty negligence as their kids grow up. They wonder at times how much of their kids' behavior comes from the parent's influence, and how much misbehaving is the fault of the child alone. Though we understand the character's self-doubt, we would also have slapped the kid to Thailand and back for mouthing off as this kid does; we understand her regrets at parenting too hard, or too soft, but we probably conclude that most parents, at one time or another, are as frustrated with children as Tilda's character is with Kevin.Petty complaints for me include two things: the director's trope of using an ironic soundtrack worked for about the first two-thirds of the movie, until we learned the trick, and the jig was up. Just as the soundtrack played a boisterous and up-beat major tune, the character coped with setbacks and accidents contrasting with the tune, as if setting off the fun she was supposed to be having (the music) with the misfortune she was actually experiencing (her son's vengeful character). But by the end, we dreaded the beginning of the music for each new scene, feeling the irony had just become cruel. Secondly, we're never shown Kevin interacting with the classmates whom he eventually murders, and he seems to carry the greatest grudge toward his mother, though he ends up killing everyone in his family except the mother character (I warned you there were spoilers!). This left the final action of the mass killings inexplicable in terms of Kevin's targets: why kill the classmates, when it's the family he hates, and why leave the mother alive, when he's been siding with everyone else against her all along? Killing sprees are, by definition, senseless, but lack of context and emotional explanation of relationships other than Kevin and Eva (the mother) left a blank we needed filled in.It's not easy to watch, but it's Oscar caliber for Swinton, and it takes you places most films wouldn't be willing to take you. Just be prepared for that ride and those destinations, for the film is so well-conducted and calculated, it's not going to leave you alone or outside of Eva's emotionally wrought experiences.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
209,HungryCreatureProductions,Gets under your skin,7,25 June 2020,"Every parent to be has fears regarding the prospect of becoming responsible for a young life. Can I really handle this responsibility? What if maternal or paternal instincts never kick in? What if my child hates me? Is the adult a child becomes dictated by the care their parents provide or is their final form dictated by their personality?So many questions, so many what-ifs.We Need to Talk About Kevin may be a different kind of film to different viewers. Some may see it as a gripping drama, others a creepy slow burn character study, and yet others may find it to be straight up horror. This film is every parent's darkest nightmare, beautifully manifest on film. It's not popcorn entertainment, but it IS a masterful work.The narrative hops between two timelines, giving enough information for the audience to remain invested but never fully holding them by the hand. Sometimes character moments are furthered through symbolic imagery and haunting sound rather than standard film exposition techniques. This gives the film an ethereal quality that is only enhanced by absolutely incredible performances by both Tilda Swinton and Ezra Miller. While the other actors in the film turn in fine performances, these two stand out so much that their characters transcend the actors themselves and live, breathe, and experience life on their own terms, fully divorced from the recognizable faces.It's not an easy story to watch, flowing like fresh flower petals down a stomach-acid stream, but it IS an important and moving one. The cinematography, lighting, and editing are gorgeous and meticulous. Great pains are taken with each and every shot of the film, the resulting images and flow are nearly flawless. The soundtrack is comprised of pre-existing music, from classical Chinese movements to old-school bluegrass, and is often used to work as juxtaposition to the action on screen. This tension pervades nearly every minute of screen time, while I personally found the music choices to be inventive and interesting, I could see how some may find it distracting or off-putting in places.The cacophony of sound, symbolism and vivid color, while inspiring in a queasy way, can add up to an occasionally heavy handed sum. There's no real on screen violence, but the results of alluded violence are clearly shown. As it is a film about parenthood and relationships, there is a fair bit of nudity and many uncomfortable situations. If the subject matter isn't enough to turn some audience members off, the films occasionally graphic nature might just do the trick. On a personal note, I felt the film could have actually taken the horror elements a bit further but I'm sure there are many that disagree.Should you see, We Need to Talk About Kevin? If a slow burn, character driven, drama horror film about parenthood and personal identity, fueled by striking visuals and gorgeous imagery sounds interesting, You Need to Talk About Kevin. If nudity, a prolonged sense of unease and discomfort, or a heavy reliance on style to tell a story are big turnoffs for you, it might be best if You Do Not Talk About Kevin.-Josh Evans",We Need to Talk About Kevin
210,irishjenna,Subtly disturbing,7,23 January 2020,"Just watched this flick, not sure how I've missed it all these years. This is definitely an art house type film shown in a non linear fashion, so it won't be up everyone's alley but I like how it was told.Now I have to correct some of these other reviews I've seen. As someone who works in the psych field and deals with patients from toddlers to seniors, I'm putting it out there right now that Kevin is not a sociopath but straight up a psychopath...and yes, they are different. Officially he can't be diagnosed under 18 with antisocial personality, so he'd be under some conduct or oppositional defiance disorder until he's 18.Psychopaths are usually born this way as oppose to sociopaths that are created through childhood trauma. Sociopaths have little empathy but psychopaths have zero empathy and cannot form true bonds with others. Their bonds are strictly superficial and self serving. They are highly cunning, calm, collected, and manipulative which can lead them to be very charming (think Bundy). Sociopaths are more impulsive, erratic, and have angry outbursts. Being a psychopath is how Kevin was able to manipulate everyone into thinking he was a good kid, all the while messing with his mom's head cause he enjoyed watching her squirm.I've also seen other posters blame Tilda as the mom, saying she never bonded with him. Well, that may make him dislike her, but that won't turn him into a killer. He's a born psychopath, period.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

We never at any point in the movie ever see the novelist mom writing, even though her book was released when her demon son was a teenager.8. Son manages to pull off a large scale massacre with a bow and arrow.A great performance by Tilda Swinton is utterly squandered on what amounts to The Bad Seed. The fractured narrative and wildly over-directed style of the film is employed to no purpose whatsoever, since the material is so flimsy. Entire scenes (like the massacre) are left entirely off-screen for no good reason. The symbolic use of red is so heavy handed and over-the-top that it's laughable.Mainly this film is The Orphan, only it lacks the balls and integrity to just be an outright horror film and instead relies heavily on film school tricks and a fractured narrative to convince the audience they're learning something.

212,BlackRoseShelli,More questions than answers,8,12 March 2013,"I wish I could remember who told me I had to watch this movie, because I'd like to thank them.While this movie started off disjointed and massively confusing, it finally settled down into something coherent and mind-blowing. And off-the-charts frightening! No parent wants to think that their child is capable of doing something so horrendous that it defies all comprehension. But it happens. Children do things that destroy lives. But how do the parents of these children, provided they survive with their lives intact, learn to live with what their child has done? This movie examines the point of view of the mother of an insanely disturbed child, not only after his horrendous crime, but his entire life leading up to the crime. We see a mother who is at a loss about what to do with her son, and a father who doesn't even see the signs and thinks the mother is just blowing things out of proportion.I think of all the parents of headline criminals, and what they must've gone through, and probably still are. Do we take pity on them, or blame them for not seeking help for their child? This movie certainly doesn't answer that question for the viewer! Major kudos to the 2 actors who played Kevin! The young boy (Jasper Newell) is a phenomenal actor for being so young. The older Kevin (Ezra Miller) had just the right mix of sweet and insane to pull off this character perfectly!",We Need to Talk About Kevin
213,ForVirg,Disturbing backwards oedipus complex,7,27 November 2012,"Warnings about how disturbing this film is cannot be underestimated. It seems to me to delve into a horrific oedipus complex turned upside down by Kevin's desire to torture his mother.I rated it 7 out of 10 because, unlike so many films about spree killers, it takes no moral stand. It simply shows the potential effects of such psychoses on everyone, but particularly on the immediate, surviving family.I am distressed when viewers feel we should hold the mother partially responsible. I believe this film shows the very real probability that the mother merely reacts to the obviously errant development of the child who becomes a psychotic killer. She does, indeed, seek help. Only to be rebuffed by doctors and experts--not to mention her consistently self-deluded husband--so labeled as an hysterical mother.As a student of neuropsychology, and a long-term ponderer of the psychology of those who kill, I have come to understand that the biology of the brain of some killers is congenital. Genetic? Maybe. Maybe not. But inborn? Positively.This film explores that possibility. Tilda Swinton plays the hapless mother of the congenitally disturbed Kevin, and does so brilliantly. Her character's growing fear of the title character, who plays her against her husband's life of denial (Reilly, played perfectly), is palpable. This grittily realistic woman makes you ponder how you would handle such a difficult reality.Of course, that is exactly the point, in my opinion. My heart breaks for her, as she lives out the consequences of ignorance in the public, who blame her for her son's evil acts. Personally, my opinion is that no matter how lurid the childhood of killers, it is nature (in the formation of the physical brain), not nurture (in the rearing), that creates a killer such as Kevin.Too many children have been raised with horrors far beyond those this title character endures; yet they do not kill. It seems to me this film points out that Kevin was born with no capacity for empathy, and, worse, with a keen appetite for torture. Particularly satisfying to him is the torture of his mother. It is disturbing in the extreme to see how well he ultimately conquers her completely. And in stealing from her a peaceful life, he condemns her to a fate worse than his own in prison.In the end, it asks us to ponder how we would feel if it happened to us. Which causes much discomfort, because of the protective mechanism in our minds that leads us to find reasons it could not happen to us. But the point is--it can.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
214,ddcharbon,"Atmospheric, uncanny, but pretentious",5,3 January 2016,"Lots of reviewers will tell you about how well acted this is--especially by Ezra Miller as the fatally charismatic yet repellent teenage psychopath--and how cool some of the filmmaking is, but this review is about the film's disassociation from reality, making it more pretentious than insightful.First, we are supposed to believe that Swinson's character is a successful entrepreneur and a best-selling author. She is a WASP who lives in a great big house and clearly is well educated. And yet in this flick in response to her son's behavior, she does not: a. seek a second opinion when a GP says her son is fine just because he (the GP) couldn't read bad affect if it hit him in the face b. seek psychological counseling for herself or her son c. articulate (remember she IS a writer) to her husband just what her fears and observations are--instead she just puts her head on his knee and stares blankly into space, again and again...d. do more to protect her young, adorable daughter, whom she clearly loves, from her truly violent son e. move out of town after the disaster and instead remains in the community to suffer face punches, major vandalism of her home, sexual harassment and universal scorn. She ran a travel agency before her son went postal and always wanted to jet off somewhere anyway, but now, she decides to remain when nothing keeps her there. Some will say that she remains as some kind of self-enforced penance, but I'm not buying it.Whatever the parent/child relationship would look like between a budding psychopath and his cold, rich WASP mom, this ain't it.Finally, her son exhibits two posts of the classic triangle for the developing psychopath: bed-wetting into late childhood and animal torture. Swinson's mother is ""harsh"" and inept during his infancy, but she is hardly the torturing abuser that would explain a psychopath. Her ""harshness"" doesn't equal Columbine. In the nurture vs. nature debate, I don't even think it's close in terms of this kid coming down as a natural born killer. He's bad way before his mother can be bad to him.And please, enough with the symbolism of blood on her hands: red paint plastered by vandals on the house that she tries to scrub or sand off in scene after scene, self-inflicted ""accidental"" cuts, dreams of swimming in blood...

217,Melvin_Tigerfists,Willfully Frustrating Film,7,25 November 2017,"This is not an easy film to watch, on any level. If, like me, you immediately begin arguing in your head with the director from the beginning, you will have to drag yourself through it. After about 30 minutes, I just had to roll with it, and it was ultimately rewarding.One of the things I ended up appreciating about the film was its stubborn resistance to giving the audience anything they have come to expect in this type of story. There is no preaching, no messaging, no resolution... just the starkness of the account. That touches on my primary criticism of the film, which I will return to later.A few great choices by the director that undermined any sentimentality or dog whistles to well-worn narratives and debates:The choice to make the dad useless. - The choice to make the setting a relatively wealthy family with apparently few temporal problems or concerns. - The choice to make the home large, impersonal and practically empty. - The choice to sidestep any political distractions of gun ownership. - The choice to portray the parents as highly imperfect or worse.A few minor criticisms:John C. Reilly's character was truly one inch deep with canned lines. He had two functions in the film - to frustrate the mother and to placate the child. And that is exactly what he did. No more, no less.The mother's workplace was too cartoonish and so were her co- workers. It's a crummy place to work full of losers. We get it. No really, stop, STOP, we get it!My primary criticism of the film, however, is that the director made the editing and the facade of the film a giant, unwelcome distraction. It's a gimmick. The story would have been MUCH more powerful had it been told quietly, but instead the entire film is almost dominated by (what I took as) nightmarish portrayals of the inner workings of the mother's mind. This is like the Marilyn Manson remix of what would otherwise be a very subversive and chilling film.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
218,loveminuszero000,Bland,3,8 May 2016,"My biggest complaint is that the movie focused too much time on the wrong things. I haven't read the book but from what I gather, the book delves deeper into the relationship between mother and son. I kept feeling like something was going to be revealed, like the mother was abusive, or absent, or something but no, other than a few brief, understandable outbursts, the mother seems perfectly fine. The fact that the son hated his mother so intensely for no real reason just wasn't believable. Other than the way he treated his mother, there were no other signs of him being a sociopath so it all seemed very much directed at her. The other thing that bugged me was how passive the mother was. The kid is torturing her for years and she says very little about it to the husband. Again, that could be explained if the mother was hiding something like abuse and felt guilty. Again, something the director fails to address.The director kept trying to make a connection between mother and son but it failed because the mother is written like a caring, normal person with empathy for others and her son is a total psychopath. The long, drawn out scenes of Tilda are pointless and add nothing to the movie. They could've cut half those scenes and shortened the ones they kept and it would've been more effective. The father seemed like a moron but honestly, I think it's just the way the movie was put together.In all, I felt I wasted my time on this movie. The plot was very badly written.

Although the story of a teenage boy who has psychotic tendencies – and end up committing murders – isn't new, it portraits the other side of the story that most films of the genre doesn't do: the mother's side.Eva is the mother who is trying to analyze what happened to her son Kevin. The whole film is told in flashbacks – we see Kevin since he was born until the night when he is arrested. Kevin always had a transgressive behavior and never had any emotions for anyone. So, is the mother in some part guilty for her son's acts or was he born like that? This is an interesting question which is discussed in real life when dealing with a teenage boy like Kevin.I don't even need to tell how Tilda Swinton was brilliant on the role of Eva which was very difficult to do – most actresses wouldn't be able to do it. It was a pity that she didn't receive a nomination for best actress in the Academy Awards.What may probably bother the ones who are not used to see this kind of film is the atmosphere – it is a slow film.

224,jz-rcsw,Where Are the Medical Progessionals?,7,1 July 2012,"Perhaps it's my training as a psychotherapist, but throughout the movie, I was wondering where were the psychological and psychiatric interventions. Other than a perfunctory assessment by a pediatrician, who sees no indication of autism and pronounces Kevin ""just fine,"" there are no indications that these parents sought professional help. Both parents enabled Kevin's increasing psychopathic behavior.Kevin's grisly slaughter of his sister's pet guinea pigs (which his mother seems not even to have revealed to the father) and his assault leading to the loss of his sister's eye seem to be denied by his parents as an imminent danger to all of them.I also reject the characterization of Eva as an emotionally refrigerated mother (which was years ago cited as a cause of autism). Rather, I believe that she sensed there was something odd and very dark about this child. In the wild, he would have been rejected by his mother and left to die. Whether Kevin is diagnosed as a sociopath or an attachment disordered child, there appears to have been little interest on the family's part in identifying and dealing with a disorder that presaged what was to become a bloodbath of monumental proportions. For that reason, I downgraded the film. The acting was wonderful, particularly that of Ezra Miller, but the parents were unsympathetic characters, not only for their massive denial, but for their failure to address the reality of the their son's disordered psyche.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
225,Foxbot,A Devastatingly Beautiful film about a Troubled Child,9,25 October 2012,"As parent of two boys and based off some of the reviews of this movie I was very unsure whether I should watch We Need to Talk about Kevin. While it does focus on Kevin, the son who is troubled, disturbed, depressed and at times violent, this films main character is the mother Eva, Played by Tilda Swinton. The cast was perfectly chosen and the multiple children who played Kevin were ideal to play one another at different ages as they look so much alike. And the older Kevin, played by Ezra Miller greatly resembles Tilda Swinton and is very believable as her son.I watched this movie the other night and I cannot get it out of my mind. It is very intense, there is a lot of symbolism and there are little things which happen and you must put the pieces together as the movie is all over the place and events are not presented in order. It is disturbing at times and makes you uncomfortable at others, yet you cannot wait to unravel the secret of the film. To start off you know something drastic happened, yet it is a very slow transformation to reveal what event happened.While a movie like this would usually leave a person depressed, I was surprisingly not so. I enjoyed the film and each level of sophistication and art style that I almost instantly wanted to watch it again.So is it worth a blind buy on Blu-ray? I would say yes! I greatly enjoyed We Need to Talk About Kevin and I am proud to own such a masterpiece of a film in my collection. Highly recommended.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

Also the son's desire to isolate the mother. And the dad being a means to an end, the sister collateral damage.Also shared by mother and son is a canny perceptiveness. Babies are necessarily perceptive. Some say autistic children are better at systems. That part of their problem is that they have trouble ignoring the patterns they see... that are inconceivable to normal people.If they're clever, they isolate the mechanisms and mimic acceptable behavior.I think, as a toddler, Kevin saw that he and his mother were alike, but she had successfully repressed or repackaged the unhappy, alienated portions of herself. He saw the divide between them, then what she wanted him to do to continue the lie of engagement.He could fool everyone else. Those who didn't know him could love him. The one who knew him couldn't.

233,bevanmortimer,One of the most harrowing films I have ever seen.,10,29 January 2013,"After struggling with myself for months, I finally decided to watch ""We need to talk about Kevin"". Knowing the subject matter of the film, my dilemma was whether or not it was for me. But after hearing good reviews from people I trust, I decided to take the plunge. I knew it wouldn't be an easy watch and it certainly isn't. My one overriding 'take out' of the film is that it is one of the most powerful and harrowing examples of film making I have ever seen. Whilst not exactly enjoyable, it does the job any great piece of serious cinema, literature, music etc should do. It stays with and provokes an emotional response from the viewer.The film concentrates on the relationship between Eva, her husband Franklin, their son Kevin, and their daughter Celia. The story is told in flashbacks, piecing together actions that lead to an event and its consequences to Eva. The full nature of the event is only revealed in the final minutes of the film, but is hinted at through its course. At the core of the film lies the question, does nature or nurture make the man. It is refreshing that the film leaves room for the audience to come to their own conclusion. From its first scenes, we are left in no doubt that the story is building up to tragedy. The broodingly atmospheric air of the film builds throughout, but thankfully never crosses the fine line of discomfort for too long. Thankfully, the film is not born from Hollywood, so does not try to tie up the story with a neat little bow. Leaving several questions unanswered and not shouting at the viewer what he or she should be thinking.The acting from the cast is first rate. As an unwilling mother to a boy ill at ease with the world, Tilda Swinton gives surely her most accomplished performance as Eva, Kevin's mother. No doubt it is only the subject matter of the film that prevented her from receiving an Oscar nomination. John C Reilly is fantastically understated in his role as Kevin's father, careful not to take the viewers attention away from Swinton. Both Jasper Newell and Ezra Miller are chilling in their depiction of Kevin at various stages in his life. Most of the plaudits will no doubt go to Miller, but the disturbing foundations of Kevin's character are expertly laid by Newell. To sum up, this film is certainly not for everyone. It is a challenging watch and will no doubt create a sense of unease in the viewer that will last from the first scenes to long after the final credits have finished rolling.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

235,helperzine,"A truly haunting and daunting but excellent film, that everybody capable should see",8,18 May 2012,"About a mother and a mentally twisted child and the scathing possibility that they reflect and affect each other in a disastrous infinite loop. The film doesn't waste time in pretending to be fearless and brave in its attempt to inform parents and their children about how small, wrong actions can become a massive snowball, tumbling down a hill, destroying everything (truly: everything) in its path. Tilda Swinton delivers the second-best performance of 2011 as the mother who sees what's going on around her, but does not realize how it came to be so. If she were a singer, I would describe her singing as being pitch-perfect, and how she's never reaching for a note. Rather: she's on the note. Instantly. If she needs to be happy and free, she is. And you can feel that she's happy and free. If character is confused and shocked to the bone, Miss Tilda will be exactly that. And you'll be too. Jasper Newell and Ezra Miller as (respectively 6-8 year-old and 15 year-old) Kevin, are monstrous and absorbing in their act. They so define the character and what's going on in his thoughts, that the viewer will understand why he thinks he's doing what he's doing, which is a very rare thing in movies. They can chill you to the bone with their utter determination in the character, giving their best. I expect to see them both as Oscar-nominees within 10 years.Director Lynne Ramsay presents everything boldly, making sure that you start out confused, and then slowly feeds you the necessary detail: teaspoon by teaspoon. She is also one-third of the story-writers. The other 2 thirds are Rory Stewart Kinnear and Lionel Shriver who wrote the book that the film is based on. This story is so complex, unsettling and potentially confusing, that these filmmakers need to be praised for not only making something cohesive from such obscure material, but actually making a great film. The film is brilliantly unassuming, in that it lays down all the cards in front of you, and gives you the opportunity and time to make of it what you will.The cinematography by Seamus McGarvey is exquisitely original, showing an entirely new world of how the camera can show what is going on. (Oscar-nomination worthy) It manages to maintain the action going on, whilst always keeping things at a distance, giving you space to think while you're watching.The music by Jonny Greenwood is interesting and fitting, and received its due attention in terms of awards.It is truly unique to see a film where so much is implied, and we (the audience) have to guess and think for ourselves. Paired with that is the subtext of the mother's desire to be somewhere else. Simply somewhere far way. Also Kevin's desire not to be understood but to be mysterious and always one step ahead of the rest. The actors achieve this so divinely through body language, making speech unnecessary. Luckily, the writers knew this, so the story is often simply left to the capable bodies of the actors.Overall, I can only say this: if you're 16 and older, and isn't easily frightened or disturbed, go see this movie. It is not only an excellent film, but is also thought-changing and necessary.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
236,f-odds-1,"Well made, but too monotone",5,21 October 2011,"From the outset, the tone of the film is relentlessly depressing. The behaviour of Kevin as he progresses from toddler to teenager (kudos for the superbly similar-looking actors involved) is bad; he seems to hate his mum, love his dad, and unless you're living on another planet, you know he's going to turn into a Columbine high school type of assassin.So what is there to appreciate? The endless flashback/flashforward mode of storytelling works well, because you know from the surroundings and from Tilda Swinton's demeanour, costume and house which stage of Kevin's development you're watching. The acting is fine, though I'm not convinced it takes all that much to play a whole film showing you're a malevolent devil-spawn (Kevin) or a long-suffering, endlessly patient mother (Swinton).The big question is: why should this interest any viewer? Well, you could argue that you watch the whole development of the Kevin character, except that he's a pathological piece of garbage from his earliest moments in the pram. You could watch the evolution of the mother, except that Tilda Swinton doesn't evolve, she just puts on number 3 face for the whole movie so you feel the occasional sense of relief on the rare occasions she does number 2 and smiles a bit (face number 1 is reserved for other movies).The end result is tedium or fascination, depending on your point of view. With apologies to all who tried so hard to make this a vivid, fascinating account of the psychological background to seriously dysfunctional teenagers, there's nothing in this film that is novel, revealing, gripping or inspirational. It's not a sleeper, but it's light years from anything that will make you want to watch it again 2 months, 2 years or 2 decades from now: and that's a pretty good criterion for judging whether to see a film or spend the time on better things.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

Channel 4 recently showed a documentary about psychopaths and this film was featured in it. Experts deemed the performance to be very like that of a real psychopath and it made me even more reluctant to watch it. I finally watched it last night and initially thought it was a bit miss jointed and wondered if I had missed some of it. The film is shown out of order with flash back and current intermixed. From a film making point of view it didn't look as good as films like The Fighter or American History X which would have added to the films bleak storyline, and playing up beat music like Buddy Holly further added to the confusion (I guess this was deliberate) Tilda Swinton's despair was portrayed very well and although Kevin's psychopathic tendencies for the most part are just mental, I remained tense throughout sensing something was going to happen.

Sooo dry, and boring.Imagine if someone was telling the story of WWII by saying: Hitler committed suicide...Romania gave Hitler Oil...the Allied chose Normandy as a second choice...FDR used a wheelchair, etc. That's how this film was to me.

Did he line the students up alphabetically? Have them draw numbers? Ask ""Jeopardy"" questions? All the events up to that atrocious idea make for a somewhat compelling, if conflicted film with solidly affecting performances from Tilda Swinton, Ezra Miller and John C. Reilly.

It's not an easy experience, but one that should definitely be had. Swinton deserves all of the praise she's gotten so far and so much more. It will be a travesty if the Academy passes on this.

Ramsey attempts to convey this but it doesn't really come through. I kept comparing the film with the book and feeling unsatisfied. Ramsey dispenses with the book's narrative device and instead implies the whole thing is told by Eva as a stream of consciousness. It feels deliberately obtuse.Tilda's performance is great.

All horror/thriller fans know what it can lead to after someone kills animals at an early age. The mother is definitely hands down an amazing actress which I'm curious why I've never scene her before in anything else because her talent in this movie is Incredible I love a good movie when I feel the emotions from the movie and this movie does just that.

251,horsecoach4hire,"Reactions, no action",4,8 January 2017,"I've seen many a good film translated from book to film. Sadly, this isn't one of them.For start, there is very little dialogue or even action in this film. Just a lot of reaction. That's fine at pivotal moments, but not every single scene. We have no idea why Eva doesn't bond with Kevin, and we are lead to believe that lack of bonding is the reason her child becomes a sociopath?It's obvious children who are sociopaths show signs as early as 3, but there are mixed signs here. I'm also astonished at the lack of parenting they display here--why is she left alone with this child constantly if she is over whelmed? The father is never home--it reads like a cliché dysfunctional family. Sociopaths come from loving homes just as much as from dysfunctional homes. It's very apparent we are missing a greater picture of a STORY--and that's just it. There is no story relayed here--if you haven't read the book, you won't know what the heck is going on. Even then, a lot is missed from the book.What we are left with are great performances of reactions, which over time, get to be very tiresome and wasting the performers. Every time a serious expression is creased in the lines of Tilda Swinton or any of the other performers, you expect to hear dialogue or see a scene...but nothing happens. I think in this entire film, there is probably less then 20 minutes of actual dialogue. For the WHOLE Film!!I also found the soundtrack irritating----singles music blaring over obviously dramatic moments----to me, this film was ruined in post production.If you want to watch an artsy film that falls hollow of a great story-line, this is it. If you want to watch a good film, sadly, this is not it. I urge you to read the book prior to seeing the film, or even cheat and pop to Wikipedia for a synopsis of the book. At least then you'd have some idea of what's going on.But this film will leave you wondering 'why did I just watch that?""",We Need to Talk About Kevin
252,CubeRic9000,Watching Kevin go to work,6,26 November 2011,"We Need To Talk About Kevin is a film that's good, but I struggled to really enjoy. This is purely down to the subject matter, and that it is so sinister and delivered with realism. For some reason I had a pre-conceived idea that it would teeter on the edge of black comedy, being serious, yet dabbling in humour every so often to lighten the mood. Well this couldn't be further from the truth. Even when something does happen that maybe slightly humorous, unintentionally so it seems, it feels wrong to laugh. And although the mood may lighten for a second, it never lasts long. It is a heavy drama to watch.The film opens with a modular disjointed narrative form, which consequently throws a viewer off balance, but wisely it tends to regain a slightly more linear form shortly after and through the entire duration. The story is rather straightforward and simple on the surface, allowing the viewer to delve as deep as they want into the questioning of why Kevin is the way he is. This is a nice touch, as it doesn't try to tie up loose ends, or drop hints so that it all clicks. It is never really explained, and in some ways is not as obvious as it may seem. So it remains up to the individual, and their own subjective interpretation of the story, and I guess values to some extent, to make up his or her own mind.For me, We Need To Talk About Kevin was all about the performances. Tilda Swinton as Eva (Kevin's mother), and Kevin as a toddler and child, were the standouts. A lot has been said about Tilda's performance and I mostly agree. I doubt it will be Oscar worthy, but it is definitely one of her best achievements. She really does seem to be tormented throughout, and I imagine it was a very draining role, which I think is evident and only works to make her character on screen, all the more convincing. She strikes a delicate balance between being a good mother, and a bad mother, that you never really know if you are completely on her side. I think this is a great accomplishment, as it would have been quite easy to slip into innocent victim mode, which she really is painted as, but the depth in her performance, keeps one pondering that there may be more to it, and never totally convinced.The death stares of Kevin (at all ages), towards his mother, are somewhat devilish. It's almost like you are waiting for the child to morph into some demonic version of himself (ala The Exorcist, Omen), but it never happens, which only helps to add to the insanity of watching a child possessing such an ever-present hatred for his mother. It makes the whole thing uneasy from beginning to end, which is the obvious intention, and also part of the reason this at times could be seen as a horror film. However, I have to mention how much I enjoyed the closing scene, as I really wasn't expecting that type of dynamic shift to be thrown up right at the end. I found Eva and Kevin's hug to be coated in symbolism, lead by their facial expressions and the strength with which one party embraces the other. Its connotations are not overtly obvious, and I probably interpret it different from the next person, but for me it added a lot to the film. Otherwise I think I would have left feeling pretty bare about the whole thing.One thing I am left to wonder however, is if this film would have been a lot more intriguing had I not known a substantial piece of the plot. A lot of critic reviews and synopses, drop a massive part of the story, and I can't help but feel it would have been better not to know, so the narrative's build to the finale is more encompassing. Instead everything was too easily comprehendible, always understanding people's actions and key scenes, without the need for too much interpretation or questioning. The fact that this plot element is never said or shown explicitly for the majority of the film, as all we witness are the resulting reactions, I can't help but think that the intention was for you as a viewer to work it out in your own time. But surely this cannot be the case, as if it is, then it's a massive oversight when creating publicity for this film. Reviews and some synopses are at the eye of the beholder though I guess, so maybe it is an accidental trip up that the producers never saw coming.Regardless, We Need To Talk About Kevin is a good watch, unique story, with great performances. A film that it wouldn't hurt to be in the right mood for, and prepared for some loaded content. Kevin has chalked up he's name as an impressive film villain, if you see it that way.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
253,thecamillocienfuegos,We need to talk about reality,5,29 March 2014,"This is a very well-made movie with some good acting that succeeded in holding my attention. Having done so, however, it proceeded to leave me frustrated and annoyed at something that initially threatened to take on several important issues - child development, parenting, and the origins of 'evil' to name but a few - but quickly degenerated into a shallow non-shocker brimming with inexplicable behaviour and lacking any sense of insight into the real issues it exploits.I'm not the first and won't be the last to observe that the title is totally misleading, since at no point does anyone attempt to actually talk about Kevin. The relationship between father and mother (Eva) is nothing short of ridiculous. Example: Kevin behaves abusively toward his mother, and turns nice when dad comes into the room, and we are expected to believe that the dad's total and inexplicable dismissal of the mother's complaints would not cause devastating tensions within their own relationship. From the beginning dad takes nothing mum says about Kevin seriously, yet she never gets angry at him, or demands his support, or even bothers to explain the extent and nature of their son's duplicity and viciousness. Meanwhile dad does not even raise any objection when Kevin is openly aggressive to his mother in front of him, or even when Kevin flatly refuses his father's request not to taunt his sister about the loss of her eye. The whole family dynamic lacks realism.In the end none of the issues raised by the movie is satisfactorily addressed. Two particular cop-outs, relating to the school shooting issue, leap to mind. The first is when Eva searches Kevin's room and finds no trace of personality at all, just empty drawers and notebooks. In reality the rooms of real school shooters were full of clues that they were going down a dark psychological path characterized by (among other things) obsession with violence, but Kevin is a fantasy figure who is so evil that he needs no psychological preparation for mass killing. The second is the massacre itself, which is carried out with (wait for it) a bow and arrow?!? Really?? Apparently some practice in the garden has turned this kid into Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves.In short, neither school killings nor killer bear a meaningful resemblance to any real-life examples of this kind of thing. Like I said, I think it does nothing more than exploits the issues it raises for dramatic impact. So, despite its merits, I would not recommend it to anyone who appreciates realistic characters or social commentary.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

This is a very visual film without a lot of dialogue in it. I guess you could call it ""art house"" style but it's also easy to follow if you pay attention to each scene and then connect that with previous scenes, in the ""Breaking Bad"" style. The first 15 minutes or so could have been done better and half of it should have been left on the cutting floor. After that it tightened up considerably.

It ought to be renamed 'We need to talk about Screen play' as the whole film, despite the interesting subject material, just didn't flow and the very short scenes and flashbacks were more irritating than anything. Other reviewers have talked about acting awards and I'm not saying the acting is poor but there are not enough range of emotions here to judge whether it is good acting or just going through the motions. The music accompanying the scenes is poorly chosen and just doesn't fit.

258,prisni,7/10,7,13 January 2013,"1:51 minutes of living through the joy, the agony and sometimes antagonistic aspects of being a parent, in specific a mother. Tilda Swinton plays out her character with the precision of a parent who has been through that trying and testing time in parenthood, which often makes a parent ask the question- Was I really meant to do this? The situation is accentuated by the fact that she, the protagonist has a successful career in travel, where the constant lure and excitement of adventure beckons, and is now reduced to daily chores, bound in a house away from the bustle of the city and frequent nappy changes for a child who resists being toilet trained. All the children who play Kevin, as he grows continue to show a hostile, unresponsive and manipulative attitude towards the mother as if to punish her for the times she wishes she were free and less duty-bound. Any attempt she makes to reconcile is often met with harsh words and actions ingeniously meant to hurt only her and yet retain friendly ties with other members of the family. Kevin, is evil. His final act says it all. As the story unfolds one is left aghast with Kevin's deeds. Ezra Miller, who plays Kevin the teenager, plays out all the nuances of being Kevin well, but one does expect more of an actor than just looking like the villain with no remorse.We need to talk about Kevin, is nonlinear and the audience will have to hold to references like Tilda's hairstyles for reference to time and situation.

It is a similar kind of thrill involved and I think there are direct references to that movie with a big empty house and with person losing his temper and sanity. The acting is amazing whereas the man character Kevin is sometimes little too much ""evil"" so to say. But after all, it is one disturbing movie for those looking for thrill. One side that could be criticized is the predictability of it. This is one thing that you might find weak about the movie. Also, the underlying symbolical language and the use of the color red are contributing a deal to the influential language of the movie.

260,mojojones77,Kevin is smart but crazy,8,9 February 2012,"By Maurice Jones Tilda Swinton is pushing her best in 'We Need To Talk About Kevin'. A movie about an American couple who give birth to a boy who they name Kevin, who is born straight out of the womb making his mother's life a living hell. The movie goes through flashbacks back and forth, to when the mother (Tilda Swinton) was the most happiest before Kevin, to when she is at her most broken down as Kevin pushes her limits. From when Kevin is born he completely hates his mother, ignoring her, degrading her, tricking her, insulting her and staring her down as if he plans to kill her and to his unaware father (played by John C. Reily) he acts like the perfect son. The mother tries to connect with Kevin in deep conversation during mother/son activities, but only to get rebuttals as to why such normal societal endeavors are pointless, which shows the insight Kevin has but how tragic for it to be surround in apparent evil. What makes the movie especially creepy is that it is never reached to why Kevin is the way he is to his mother. When she thinks things are alright with her relationship with her son, Kevin quickly makes it known that things are the same. With all this, the mother is frustrated and therefore mentally tortured to no end but seems to just accept things the way they are, waiting for the day Kevin will be out of her life for good.Tilda Swinton gives an interestingly paced, realistic performance. You can always point just when her character is about to break and the depth of the character's confusing with Kevin. And as expected, if one never knew of Tilda Swinton, there is no guess that she is English, definitely one of her best. Ezra Miller deserves enough regards as older Kevin playing him without the slightest inch of remorse and nods to the child actor who played younger Kevin with realistic accuracy. John C. Reily is perfect casting as the clouded father who doesn't see Kevin's bad behavior, but the character it's self lacks realism and in part weighs the movie down.'We Need To Talk About Kevin' is essentially the most extreme version of a realistic mother and son relationship. It is also a straight-forward telling of how a child can be more socially aware and honest than his parent. Through his dislike for his mother Kevin also seems to be the one in the whole movie that even though he is absolute evil, who just wants people to be who they really are and see things for what they really are instead of seeing things like having a child or partaking in social norms as things that you just do. With this Kevin makes himself a sacrifice of some unknown greater good to counter act society itself but in which it turns out he's human all along.'We Need To Talk About Kevin' sucks you in with location and content. The bright atmosphere of the movie contrasts with how dark Kevin's personality is and guides you into a ride of uneasiness, and throughout the movie your just constantly asking ""Why?"" This with Tilda Swinton makes for an interestingly disturbing yet great thought provoking movie.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

The personification of evil is portrayed in this young boy. All three ages develop the character little by little and the 2 younger versions of Kevin were excellent. They didn't seemed to be fazed by what was a very challenging role. The third tier of Kevin though played by Ezra Miller was as cold as I have ever seen. Fantastic performance. Come the end you will want to kill this kid for the pain he has caused not only his mother, but you also!As for Eva, she was played to perfection and an Oscar should have been inevitable but as far as I know she was overlooked, some things just make no sense and this is one of them. Pain, Grief, Anger, Guilt, Sadness, Love, Remorse and the list could go on, she delivers them all.I was very impressed with John C Reilly also. He made the transition from stupidity to reality look simple. There is nothing entertaining about this film.

264,clare-karu,"Disturbing, suspenseful horror",9,13 December 2011,"Firstly, if Tilda Swinton doesn't at least get an Oscar nomination, I'll eat my hat. Her depiction of the many faces of fear and depression in this movie are something unique to the cinema I've seen.The young actor Ezra Miller who plays the teenaged Kevin, puts in such a believable performance of a smug, manipulative psychopath that its hard not to seriously hate him. I hope he hasn't typecast himself on the strength of this performance.I'm sure much has been written about whether evil is in-born or nurtured or both - I don't think the movie is primarily about that. I think, quite clearly, the character of Kevin is not meant to be a realistic depiction of the aetiology of violent psychopathy. Its generally observed that most psychopaths as well as having genetic and in-utero influences have severely screwed parenting - not the 'good' or 'good enough parenting' as seen in the film. Other non-realistic aspects of the film include the Father's ongoing denial and Eva's not at least considering and trying psychological help for herself and/or her son. These are not criticisms' - just observations that further my argument that the film is not a realistic film and requires a bit of suspension of disbelief. Which is not difficult as it very successfully exploits some our most primal fears.Instead, I think the movie is primarily about parenting itself, particularly mothering (mostly the negative aspects- yes, but its not a horror film for nothing). Our fears and guilt. Our sorrow and tiredness. And wow - it mines these fears - of our failures, that our kids will turn out horrible and unlovable, with incredible success. This is partly because this aspect of family and life is very rarely explored publicly and partly because we have all brushed up against fear, guilt and failure when it comes to familial relationships. This film just asks us to extrapolate our experiences of ordinary failures to the most horrific consequences imaginable.OK, so now I eat my hat. Tilda Swinton did not get the nomination. Boo! And Meryl Streep won with an (albeit nuanced) impersonation of Margaret Thatcher in what was a pretty average biopic that shyed away from being too political.

266,ReelGA,Swinton's face so naturally lends itself towards desperation,10,18 September 2012,"Ever since Scottish director Lynne Ramsay's ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" premiered to critical acclaim in Cannes this past May, I've been one of many with high, high hopes. Going back to 2008 when star Tilda Swinton won her Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for ""Michael Clayton,"" I was a bit of a sore loser over her beating out Cate Blanchett's Bob Dylan in ""I'm Not There."" I think Swinton is a gifted actress, but I've only really become a fan with her post-Oscar roles. Her stunning performance in ""Kevin"" is all the more rewarding because it anchors such a powerful film.Based on a 2003 novel by Lionel Shriver, ""We Need to Talk About Kevin"" follows Eva Katchadourian (Swinton) as she raises her son and deals with the aftermath of the mass murder he commits at his high school. The film manages to accomplish a lot without the use of much dialogue. The book is written as a series of letters from Katchadourian to her husband Franklin (John C. Reilly), but Ramsay was able to tell the same story without any narration. Recollections are intertwined seamlessly with present day, allowing the audience to see a full account of the tension and struggle of the past with the misfortune and uneasiness of Katchadourian's present circumstance.I haven't seen a single color used so purposefully throughout an entire film since the same deep red was used so handily in Pedro Almodovar's ""Volver."" I would think such a visually- leaning film like this would be easier to make if it were an original screenplay rather than adapted, but I see that as a testimony to the talent of the filmmaker.The film certainly doesn't offer any comfort aside from a couple of unexpectedly touching moments between mother and son placed at two polar opposite times in the story. Swinton's face so naturally lends itself towards desperation, making those moments all the more meaningful when she is transformed. Kevin's character, played by Ezra Miller and younger counterparts Jasper Newell and Rocky Duer, is definitely a tag-team effort. Miller isn't any better than Newell despite having a bit more to chew on. Reilly was good enough as Kevin's lovable lump of a father, but perhaps could have had more to do.If the movie can get seen by enough Academy members, it should have no problem landing Swinton a Best Actress nod in the very least for one of the best performances I've seen all year.4.5 out of 5 stars.Check out more reviews by Cameron McAllister at Reel Georgia - www.ReelGA.com",We Need to Talk About Kevin
267,sarahjanenorth,This is a masterclass in why the book is almost ALWAYS so much better,3,14 August 2019,"The novel was devastating - one of the most impressive books I've ever read over the years.It still stays with me, still resonates, every time a new school shooting or atrocity occurs - sadly even more regularly that at the time it was written, post Columbine.
As a mother of then-Young boys, it made me think, question, fear my every feeling and response to parenting - I know many felt the same. It was hard to read and hard to look away, so a triumph of a novel, given the premise was certainly to make us all think!The movie was highly anticipated- even more so, with Tilda Swindon so well cast.
But sadly, it just never quite made it, the message was lost, the detail was lost - the focus was definitely Tilda - not Kevin - whereas the book was a clever retrospective essay on parenting this very difficult (!) child, detailing all his idiosyncrasies and behaviours, as any parent in this position would - going over and over every single detail....what could have I have done differently? Why didn't I see this? Did I see this? It definitely focused on Kevin.It must be difficult to convey the ""letter-based unburdening"" on which Eva embarks on celluloid, instead of in writing, but maybe the obvious approach would have worked better - as others have said, the story is strong enough without the need to try and be clever..?
We are supposed to wonder if Eva contributed to the final outcome...there is always something in the history of the parenting surely, but is Kevin a psychopath? Certainly! Could they have ""talked about Kevin?"" They did in the book!
John C Reilly - wasted!
The big reveal - wasted!
Sadly underwhelming - and I wanted to ""love"" it!",We Need to Talk About Kevin
268,Honu-86,"Artistically inclined, but lacking definition",3,17 July 2020,"Personally, I could not get behind this movie as much as I'd have liked to, given its publicity through hype and review. However, I must give credit where credit is due. The director does a fantastic job of expressing tension and emotion during otherwise unassuming scenes, and this holds up throughout the film, leading to a consistently suspenseful experience that does not let up; giving the viewer a never-ending sense of foreboding which, frankly, is never relieved.The main issue I had with the movie were the characters themselves. Kevin is clearly a troubled child from day one, constantly crying whenever in the presence of his mother. This in itself seems a bit too...resentful for an infant who would normally lack the cognition required to do so. But then, we can all agree, Kevin is not a normal child. Even as a toddler, Kevin refuses to bond with his mother even when she attempts to do so. He angrily avoids playing ball with her and then, as a young child, refuses to potty train simply because he wants to induce suffering on his mother. When she finally snaps and accidentally breaks his arm, he 'magically' uses the toilet. Kevin is, meanwhile, perfectly normal and benevolent around his father, Franklin, who appears throughout the movie as a well-meaning but oblivious parent. Kevin's mother, Eva, is naturally frustrated by her son's abusive behavior but, at the same time, appears too complacent and enabling at times, folding to the whims of her child instead of taking on a authoritative parenting role. One can argue that, since she didn't want children, she is naturally ignorant to parenting in general and perhaps doesn't possess the innate instincts of motherhood. During the present-day segments of the film, where Eva is tormented by the public for the 'deed' that her son committed, she is accepting of her punishment, taking her abuses in stride without complaint, and even admits openly to a pair of missionaries that she's going to hell.Eva's second child, Celia, is more realistic in her overall demeanor and behaves just as any child would. Kevin seems to be evil simply for the sake of being evil and persistently lashes out at his mother in subtle, but destructive ways, for no reason other than she's his mother. On a more philosophical level, one can say that Kevin represents Eva's sins incarnate and is born out of punishment for her seemingly selfish ways, even though we're not sure what they are. She is a woman being punished for apparently no reason at all. Then, at the penultimate scene, Kevin takes out his anger and rage on the innocents, presumably as a way of ensuring that his mother is forever haunted by his misdeeds, even if it means forfeiting his own freedoms. The only indication of any humanity or remorse from Kevin is during the very last scene as he's about to be transferred to an adult prison. He is beaten up and his head has been shaved; he is finally the one paying for his sins and then, and only then, do he and his mother see eye to eye. For me, it's a rather pointless scene that drew no empathy from me for either character.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
269,Nessi-3,Good adaptation of book but probably unsatisfying movie if you haven't read the book,7,1 March 2012,"I had read the book and was eagerly awaiting the movie, partly also because of Tilda Swinton who I think one of the most prolific actresses of our time. Her performance is outstanding as always, a blink of an eye, an almost invisible twitch on her front saying more than a whole dialogue could. Ezra Miller as Kevin is superb (as are Rock and Jasper). He shows an arrogance towards his fellow human beings (i.e. his parents) it's almost unbearable. The nightmare of any parent: an arrogance you cannot really fight against because on the surface there is nothing to fight against.The interaction between Tilda Swinton and John C. Reilly is very subtle and portraits very nicely the somehow uneven couple they are. Although perhaps not knowing the book makes it not as obvious, they could just seem odd. A lot more topics, I don't want to list here, are probably not easy to understand - if not confusing - not having read the book.Generally the adaptation succeeded. I definitely didn't like the overpowering use of the colour red. For red is in my country associated with rage and passion but not with guilt. Apart from that I found it exaggerated tinting everything red even if not necessary for the context (like a usually green exit sign being red, posters on a wall, people's cloths). Do people get what happened in the school without knowing the book? The scene is very well done not showing explicitly what Kevin does behind locked doors, but then also you don't get his motivation which is obvious in the book. A further detail I really didn't like in the movie is the emphasis on the mother's faults making her look more guilty than the father who on his side is always downplaying Kevin's behaviour whenever Eva brings up the issue and so nurtures Kevin's ego, he taking advantage of it shamelessly.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

274,connie-baldini-427-561037,Everything and Nothing,9,4 January 2013,"When I had first heard of this film and its 'disturbing' nature, I was hesitant to view it. However, having just seen 'Perks of Being a Wallflower' starring Ezra Miller, who plays Kevin as a teenager, I was intrigued. Ezra Miller is a star. Whether he receives acclaim for these 2 films or not, he is definitely one to watch on the film scene. Before viewing this film, I actually read several reviews which do not do the film justice. Not to sound clichéd, but you must see this film to believe it. I've titled my review ""Everything and Nothing"" because it's almost impossible to put into words just exactly what happens; what we see on the film, and what is purposely hidden from us. This is definitely a film that will provoke controversy and debate after viewing. Tilda Swinton is astonishing in this role, or should I say roles. We see a woman in different phases of her life, and how she reacts to each phase. Career-oriented world traveler, doting wife, fragile mother. And in each of the 'roles', Swinton's face is better than anything a costume designer or make up artist could use to convey raw, deep, confused emotion. Without giving too much away, Swinton is the mother of a troubled son; married to a simple man, and the mother to a non-troubled little girl. We are told that Kevin is troubled, but nothing in this film will make you jump out of your seat or run from the room screaming. Tense is the best possible word I could use to describe the tone of the film. And heart breaking is the definitely the word I would use to describe Swinton's performance. While everyone in the film did give decent portrayals of their characters, none come close to Swinton and Miller in the dance they do in this film. This film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival and during a Q & A, Swinton began answering a question by stating 'well this is a love story after all. deep down'. After seeing this film, try to wrap your head around that statement. If you do, you've definitely seen and understood the movie the way that I did; and recognize how truly excellent it really is.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
275,genslen,A Shocking - and Frustrating - Guilt Trip,3,3 November 2018,"I wanted to like this movie, but I found myself shouting at the screen so many times that, by the time the story wrapped up, I wasn't rooting for anyone. A dark take on the whole ""bad seed"" theme, Tilda Swinton play the frustrated mother to a child with so many problems, it's hard to know where to start. And, while most of his aggression is aimed directly at her, I find it hard to believe that NO ONE else in his life (teachers, neighbors, the other people in town) noticed his disturbing behavior as a child. His father is clueless, always siding with the child even as he's defiant in front of the parents. ""He's a boy...that's what boys do."" Um, no. This kid clearly has psychological issues--anyone can see that.But the filmmakers choose to ignore that and blame nearly everything on the mother. She tries and tries to connect with her son, and he's nothing but snide and manipulative, to the point where the movie drifts from being a twisted family tale into straight up horror movie land. Whenever she notices him doing something wrong, he always looks up and her and smiles. ALWAYS, even when she's in the kitchen and he's outside and can't possibly know where she is or what she's thinking. It's all over the top guilt aimed squarely at the one person who's actually trying to fix the problem.By the way, as a parent and member of the community, I find it hard to believe this kid's behavior would be tolerated. It starts at the beginning and just gets worse--but the mother doesn't seem to realize that her child is different. I can't believe she doesn't talk to other parents to get a sense of what kinds of behaviors are normal rebellion and which ones are clearly sociopathic. And after the ""incident,"" I would have moved away. The only reason she would choose to stay in the same town is for the punishment, blaming herself for what happened. She's found her own personal hell, and she thinks what Kevin did was her fault--and she should pay the price. I found it unbelievable, though. All kids are special and different, but a kid like that needs professional help,, not a new bow and arrow. Thanks Dad!In the end, they don't ""talk about Kevin,"" and that's the primary issue. Maybe if they had, things would have turned out differently. I liked that the filmmaker chose to show less violence than she could have, but I wonder why--the entire film sets up how evil this child is, but then, in the end, the filmmaker protects us from seeing the result of that evil.

And I have to say its not easy to find one. This movie was waiting in my watchlist for some time now and I thought what better time to watch it. Fast forward in the movie, it start off really strangely with no dialogues and weird unrelated scenes in what seemed like an eternity. I thought it was one of those art movies that uses weird camera angles and lights to bore watchers to death. But I was sure in for a surprise when the movie started picking up pace. Character development is a key thing in the movie and ended with a bang. Why not rate it higher then? The movie tries really hard to give itself the benefit of an ""art film"" by dragging scenes and stuff where it isn't required and serves no purpose whatsoever other than make the viewer want to fast forward. It could have been a better movie with over 30 minutes of it erased.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

It struck a positive note with me for its camera/video/audio/narrative style which was nothing short of simply outstanding. At the same time, however, the film had a truly disturbing, upsetting, revolting and petrifying effect on me with its emotionally and psychologically overwhelming and, I'd even go as far as to say, ""vein slashing"" subject that keeps you both physically and mentally captivated, engrossed, mesmerised and, most of all, simply put, shocked. It has been the second most unpleasant movie script and subject matter to swallow and digest in my entire film loving experience after the notorious Irreversible (2002). Yet it has also climbed up the ladder to the top of my preference and recommendation list for the quality of its presentation. Up until today I was having great difficulty understanding, never mind explaining, the concept and meaning of the word ""ART"". From now on, if someone asks me for a definition of that word, I will just point out this film as one of the most precise, elaborate yet bearably succinct medium towards its comprehension. Certainly not everyone's cup of tea, especially, the faint hearted. It is, nonetheless, a ""must watch"" !!!",We Need to Talk About Kevin

Kevin is the same and even though some sneakiness is hinted at it's never really developed.It seems like too much focus was put on arty shots and everything else was forgotten. For instance - why did she get to the school at night? It should have been daylight but I guess the emergency services lights wouldn't have looked nearly as good.Why didn't the police search her house and find her family?

One day he decides to trap a bunch of kids in the school gym and execute them Robin Hood style.At first the use of flash backs were confusing and took me a little while to get that they were actually flash backs. The all over feel of the movie is intense and raw which aids in the telling of the story. You'll be pulled in all different directs throughout the story.

281,The_Frase,"Gripping tale of guilt, grief and shame",8,15 December 2011,"'We need to talk about Kevin' is a tale of guilt, grief and shame of a mother (Tilda Swinton) whose son Kevin (Rock Duer, Jasper Newell and Ezra Miller) has committed an atrocious massacre at his school. Based on the acclaimed novel by Lionel Shriver (2003) and directed by Lyne Ramsey who has been missing from the movie horizon of recent years, a powerful and excellently constructed piece of cinema is upon us.The storey encompasses the mothers' outlook on life before, during and after the event. The use of a non-linear time frame allows the film to be constructed in such a way that to those unfamiliar with the original text will be led in one direction of thought as to the characters progression only for the film to turn on its heels and lead you in another direction. The casting and acting is of paramount importance in a film where the primary relationship between two characters forms the basis of context for the others. Swinton offers an excellent drawn out, confused, guilt ridden mother whereas Ezra Miller as Kevin gives us an unflinching look into the abyss of a sociopath.The casting of as the father John C. Reilly for me was the only flaw, simply due to his recognisable and somewhat comical appearance, which when compared to the subtlety and non-obtrusive nature of the remaining cast and extras stands out although his performance was strong.Ramsey's use of symbolism and carefully inserted mise en scene gives those with a more discerning eye glimpses of the details of the emotional frailties evident in the novel but which are often so hard to convert when any literary text makes the transformation into the medium of film, we all know the saying 'the book was much better'. But here the both Lynne Ramsey and Roy Kinnear develop an excellent screen play that will satisfy both those who have read the book and those who have yet to. The sequencing of opening shots in most scenes allows a strong sense of atmosphere to develop even before the characters have entered the scene or dialogue has even commenced.The overall impact of the film rides through peaks and troughs. With some sections brilliantly gripping and others making you wish away the remainder of the film. In general the film does carry a strong and unsettling momentum until the final credits. For those looking for an action soaked gore fest will be left waiting as will those looking for the docudrama styled film similar to Gus Van Sants' Elephant (2003). The film won't be for all or maybe even for that many, but those who enjoy carefully layered cinema creations will be drawn to this title like a moth to a flame and with good reason.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
282,RayWetCanvas,"""Tilda Swinton Gives a Performance of Our Generation""",10,1 June 2012,"Tilda Swinton gives a performance of our generation as well as others in the cast despite Lynne Ramsay's choppy confusing camera work. In fact the acting is so good it transcends the segmented storyline and countless flashbacks. We know what time-line we are watching from Tilda Swinton's hair style and face which becomes as scored as the lines on a road map at her present life. Bottles of merlot and pills help her reach the end of each day.What can I say about Tilda Swinton's performance...its Hillary Swank's tenacity in Million Dollar Baby, Theron's survival trait in Monster all rolled into one. She hits every emotion on the human compass. She survives despite being in the wrong marriage with the wrong child at the wrong time. Sadly her performance fell through the cracks by the Academy elite and we were left with Hollywood formula movies this year for best actress at the Oscars. One, a dismal biopic IRON LADY and the other domestic help in the 1960's south played only half convincingly by Viola Davis. (Davis is a double- barrel actress and here she held back).I have reviewed many movies here and this is the first 10 I have ever given. I tried watching a movie one day after viewing this film, it didn't work. I could not absorb it. This movie was that powerful. This movie will float around in your mind for days after, and if you are a parent even more so.

That way we lose control over our lives. This is a story about the mother who abandoned her dreams, she lived in the house that she did not like. She did not have enough love for herself. She could not give love to others. This is a story about a boy who needed the love of his mother and who was forced to draw her attention by any means. So it came to the worst. Nobody is to blame. All to blame. Except for one little girl, an innocent victim of collapsed compromises. This is a story of how the unlearned lessons of love are taught by evil.

It's an intriguing script idea but it doesn't happen to be what Kevin is actually about. The high school mass murders here are a sort of foregone conclusion to the story of a mother who is emotionally terrorized by her son, beginning when he is an infant. This is a unique piece in that the story is told in non-linear flashbacks and the cinematography is experimental. Yet the story to me plays closer in genre to horror than to a psychological drama you might see at the art-house. I can recommend this movie if it's only on the multiplex at the mall level. Otherwise we're looking at something that it is on the edge of camp. Witness the scene where the mother tries to explain reproduction to her little boy via the Mama Bear and Papa Bear and the boy interrupts, ""Is this about f*ckin'?"" If it isn't highbrow horror Kevin is just Mommy Dearest with the abuse roles switched around. Did you want the gays to love your movie like that?",We Need to Talk About Kevin

This film is less about entertainment and more about shedding light on a most uncomfortable subject. Hats off to the Kevin's! Ezra Miller, Jasper Newell and even young Rock Duer commit w/o any hint of hesitation. How they found it within them to empathize with writer Lionel Shriver's Kevin Khatchadourian character is beyond me. The entire cast is phenomenally well suited, an perhaps what makes this feel so real in addition to relevant. And Jonny Greenwood finds another way to put a moody soundtrack in your head without you knowing it. Questioning what makes certain kids murderers and others athletes, we've heard and seen that. Questioning the very idea of giving childbirth and the ""lottery"" of what you'll bring into the world, now that's a challenge for audiences. And what's possibly more upsetting than the brutal reveal scenes are the moments of what life is like for a mother after her son has committed a school shooting.

She embodies the harder truths of motherhood more than the happy happy joy joy images of the media. But is it an act of penance for her complicity? Did Kevin act on her own unconscious desires?

Her excellent acting carried the movie as well as that of John C Reilly and all of the actors playing Kevin. That being said, I found the screenplay disjointed and confusing. I've never been a fan of ""time jumps"" and this movie abounds with them. Kevin's age is obviously a clue as to what point of the story you're at as well as the length of Tilda's hair but it's still distracting. My personal feeling is that directors sometimes get too impressed with themselves and use these methods to show off their technique. Sadly, in this case, at the expense of the story.

Completely awful miscasting of that goofy-looking John C. Reilly as the dad, even if he did act his part well enough. The young actor who plays Kevin as a teenager is very handsome, with striking almond-shaped eyes, as if he had an Asian grandparent--he looks nothing like either of his ostensible parents. The second half picked up a bit, but they left out the scene where Kevin tells his dad what he really thinks of him, a significant breech. The end fell flatter than in the novel.

292,SuzanneMakingReviews,the movie is just a piece of art and the story does have a point,10,2 March 2014,"I have seen so many mixed reviews, people who liked it and people who thought there was no point in the whole story or simply they didn't like how the movie were shoot and I decided that it is time to watch this movie, especially after hearing so much about the book itself -which I totally plan to read after watching the movie-.The movie is just a piece of art and the story does have a point, you just need to see it with your heart and mind together. some people won't be able to pin the point and that is understandable, the majority of people don't even know there is a problem as such as the problem the movie and the book tried to capture and put out.The story is such a heart gripper, the whole movie I wasn't waiting to know what happened, no, I waited to see ""WHY"" and I wasn't disappointed, the last scene gives you that one thing you wanted to understand from the start. Unlike so many other people who got frustrated about the end, I found it perfect and makes all sense in the world: Kevin needed one thing, Kevin wanted to have one thing from his mother that he never got, a hug. he wanted her to hug him with all her might and all her heart for once, for once he wanted her to feel something about him, toward him.I'm extremely disappointed in the views especially the ones that were supposed to be from professional critics who couldn't see the point, the reasons behind Kevin behaviors, how a mother can build a child or destroy them completely.I'm not blaming the mother completely here, sometimes a child DO born with some evil inside him, and during their lifetime they can control how evil they will become and they can stop themselves if they wants to or, if the parents were able to see the problem they will have to show the child more love and more care than an average child would need.point is: You absolutely need to watch this movie, to FEEL it with their heart and understand it. it have good point: a little bit of love can change everything. Simple as that. Stop trying to make the storyline reasonable ""can a child be born evil? is that even real?"" you know only 1% of this world, how can you judge if that was reasonable or not based on just that 1% ? you can't and you shouldn't.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
293,i-r-matt,A very good adaption of a brilliant book.,7,27 March 2012,"Having read Lionel Shriver's novel beforehand, I find it very hard to watch Lynne Ramsay's adaption without a biased viewpoint. We Need to Talk About Kevin has become one of my favourite books, so, from the start, I was skeptical about the film. I was both pleasantly surprised and disappointed. While Tilda Swinton's interpretation of Eva is a million times better than any other female actress could portray, I feel that her role was directed in a way that made her look much colder and less relatable. Ezra Miller played the role of Kevin fantastically, and should definitely have won some form of big award this season! Many of the themes from the book were represented well in the film: themes of childhood, upbringing and the idea that Eva is much more alike to Kevin than she would wish to think were all presented in a great way. Something that disappointed me, was that the theme of 'nature vs. nurture' was not expressed very well in the film, unlike the book: was Kevin always destined to be a mass murdering, robotic child, or was Eva's neglect and hostility, while raising him, the reason for his evil ways?Finally, while I understand that it is impossible to include every single scene of a book in a film adaptation (The Time Traveler's Wife barely even managed a third), I was disappointed that a few parts of the book which I found pivotal to the plot, were not included. For example, Kevin's schoolwork and relationship with teachers, Siobhan the Irish nanny, or characterisation of Celia, emphasising the contrast between her and Kevin.All in all, a good film. Imagery, flashbacks and cinematography have all been used brilliantly in this film. No film will ever live up to the book's standards, but this was a damn good try by Lynne Ramsay which should have gained more recognition during awards season. I look forward to seeing more of her work.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
294,csisman-595-441500,Badly paced but interesting,6,19 July 2013,"This movie, based on the book of the same title by Lionel Shriver is a fascinating exploration into what makes somebody a killer. It is intentionally left for the viewer to decide whether Kevin became a killer because his mother did not love him, or if she did not love him because he was born evil. The movie's protagonist is Eva Khatchadourian, and it covers Kevin's life from Eva's pregnancy to the moment at which he murders 15 students and his father and sister with a crossbow.The movie does an average job, in my opinion. Tilda Swinton is excellent as Eva, and Ezra Miller plays Kevin pretty well. Eva's husband, Franklin Plaskett's role is really underplayed in the movie, having only a few lines. It's very hard to believe that Eva and Franklin have ever had a good relationship and this somewhat undermines the tragedy of his death.The movie builds suspense slowly and has a lot added (not from the book) about Eva's life after Kevin's spree. This is frankly quite boring and I found myself wanting to skip forwards.The blood symbolism is clumsily overplayed - almost every five minutes we have to watch Eva cleaning red paint off her house or smothered in some red goo at a non-descript 'foreign' ritual, or Kevin piling jam onto a slice of bread. It isn't needed and I found it patronising.It's hard to believe that a fantastic cast working very hard, and an amazing novel could produce a disappointing film, but for me it was. It still gets some marks for the plot and the acting, but everything else seems like a director's wet dream and a viewer's worst nightmare.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

Almost nothing happened throughout the entire movie, other than Tilda Swinton staring blankly at all around her. I felt completely bored and unmoved throughout the whole thing.

If you are interested in finding out about the motivations of a young boy who kills his classmates, I suggest you read the truly amazing book, 'Nineteen Minutes' by Jodi Piloult.

I will definitely watch it at least once a year from now on to make it up.I guess my favorite part of this movie is the non-linear narrative technique, which confuses you on the chronology of the events, especially in the first 15-20 minutes. For instance, we watch the main character, Eva, having crazy fun at the tomato festival in Spain at the beginning, but in the next scene, she is living a miserable life in a poor house. This type of narration and editing naturally makes you more curious about what happened to Eva.Tilda Swinton played astoundingly (1) a mother who is raising a problematic child, and (2) a miserable woman that has been excluded from the society; and while she is acting that astoundingly, the director Lynne Ramsay performs a wonderful directing.

I had heard all the rave reviews this received and also knew that this would be one hell of a depressing movie watching experience. Being someone who loves to watch these types of challenging movies... I went ahead and finally got the DVD. Well after finishing the movie I've got to say that the movie did indeed live up to my expectations. Yes, by the end it did leave me half-hanging. I was anticipating a more rewarding and thorough conclusion but then I reflected back on the movie and finally understood that such an ending wasn't needed in the context of the movie. The movie itself with all it's minimalist and intricately crafted scenes serves its intended purpose without the need for any cheap or charlatan tricks anywhere. And that in itself is where the movie really triumphs. Like many have said before, no scenes are wasted and everyone concerned does a grand job of putting the story on celluloid. That said, this movie isn't for everyone. Especially aforementioned, the people who might want to actually see explosions and head-over-heels twists, like most of the jargon we are dished up today. No, ""We Need To Talk About Kevin"" on the other hand is a movie which you should see , observe and then reflect upon. You should only watch it if you have THAT kind of patience, time and willingness to enjoy good movies. Even though, I do believe that a movie such as this should be watched by the vast majority out there, especially would- be parents.... I'd certainly advocate against watching it, if you have a short attention span.Now having got that out of the way and having told you what NOT to expect out of the movie. I'll tell what this movie is about without spoiling it for you. Overall it's about the protagonist being psychologically challenged by all the happenstances in her life, especially her dysfunctional relationship with her son. The viewer is captivated by the scenes and the events throughout. The movie does a good job in presenting mundane things and how they can go wrong, without necessarily passing a judgment. We all know the story, of how things can go from bad to worse. Sometimes all it takes is just to sit down and assess the situation... Yet at other times that's the one thing we take for granted and never end up doing. And therein lies our biggest failure. And this is exactly what the movie succeeds in portraying so well. Also a point to mention: From very early in the movie, you realize what direction it is taking........ so this movie is not to be mistaken as a suspense thriller. Perhaps the biggest reason, people are disappointed by this. Instead take the movie for what it is: a psychological thriller. Just taste it, chew it and savour it, but don't attempt to swallow it as a whole else you'll end up throwing up.Bottomline: A rare movie perhaps falling in the half ""docu-drama"" and half psychological thriller category.

300,Cortland259,Trying to understand why there are Colunbine & CO movie theater shooting,8,26 July 2012,"We need to talk about Kevin. Sounds like the right thing to do for the two parents, early in the very beginning when they spot something not quite right. Why we have such cold-blooded killers? Of course, nature plus nurture that make those people. Kevin may be a difficult baby. Mother could not accommodate to his difficult temperament. When the baby cries, why can't the mother just hold the baby tight to make him feel safe but instead hold him high up in the air at an arm's length?! It's such a simple thing for the mother to do! Yet she did not do. That child needs some skin-to-skin touching, the attaching, the attachment, the secure attachment to a grown-up or two. We don't see any such attachment--the holding, the carrying, the hugging, the embracing, nada; only the continuous crying and the mother felt helpless and non-responsive to the crying. The mother seems lack of love to the child, Kevin. So we see the consequences: Kevin became a manipulative toddler, a non-compliant little boy, an abusive big brother, and .... a killer teenager. He may be born this way: he inherited the genes from both parents, but he received a lot of information from his environment (the parenting provided by Eva and Franklin) that intensify his tendency to a callous person devoid of empathy. Eva needs to blame herself for being a nervous, inadequate parent--not firm enough when disciplining is called for and not warm enough when encouragement is needed. The movie posted a good question as why there are Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold of Columbine shooting in 1999 and why there is James Holmes of Batman film shooting in 2012 (a few days ago).

301,zeppelin-fest,Because grey is more eerie than red,8,20 January 2012,"We entered the abandoned auditorium of an amateur cinema without knowing that we paid for double tragedy. We had envisioned a journey from birth to death, not expecting that both: beginning and end would include unresolved tragedies. Shot in the eerie style of better horror film days, the cinematic grip holds us down with fragment story telling. The narrative seems chaotic until a red thread appears in muddy waters. We did not mind the stereotypical colour games which sell out the colour red. The editing succeeds in unearthly linking mother and son. This construction of a double vision enticed our lazy eyes. To melt both characters into each other while constructing for both a very different melt down convinced us of unique cinematic moments. Mother and son are fascinating because both explore the grey zones of neither/nor. They are not, however, painted as complex entities beyond comprehension. Instead, they inhabit the ""greyness"" of being emotionally confusing. Who is guilty? Who made the mistake? We are asked to answer and to divide our sympathies. But at the same time it is clear that there is no easy way out. Everything we see could already be the result of tragedy. There is no objectivity. There is no moment untouched by pain. So, how can we form an unprejudiced opinion? Our roller-coaster ride turns out to be the aftershock. But this is no secret: from the beginning we are told we are heading towards tragedy.Mother and son are compelling us to remain seated. But Tilda holds everything together. She keeps us wondering. She is even more multi-faceted than you could have expected. In our minds we built her monuments while watching every step. We keep guessing even though the film is long over. These cinematic characters do not stop polluting our thoughts. One day we will return to the amateur cinema.

303,bingobingo25,Haunting,10,3 October 2018,"Visually, the film is stunning. Colors, sets, images are all used to tell so much without having to spell the rest out for you.You feel like you're in a never ending nightmare which is exactly how Tilda Swinton's Eva feels every single day since the tragedy involving her son took place.All of the acting is top notch but this film belongs to Swinton. Post-partam depression is tricky. Nobody seems to want to discuss it and mothers who experience it are often shamed and lead to believe that they're not cut out for motherhood. Eva assumed that those feelings would go away once her son was actually born but instead she had...well, Kevin.I highly recommend this film. It's emotionally quite brutal but surprisingly leaves quite a bit of violence up to your imagination if gore isn't your thing.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
304,MayKasa,Suffocating,5,3 June 2012,"I love to be exhilarated by movies, whether exciting, depressing, or life-affirming. This film was none of those things. I felt claustrophobic throughout its duration; couldn't wait for it to end. Indeed the film had some amazing shots that were thought-provoking. But this did not compensate for a lack of plot. In fact, a coherent storyline did not start until about 40 minutes into the film. Rather, it seemed as if the director wanted to show off her avant garde style of filmmaking. The main draw to see this film, besides the exciting previews, was Tilda Swinton. She has given amazing performances in the movies THE DEEP END and JULIA (a phenomenal film all around). But why is she always playing victimized, tortured characters? It's getting old and tired. Ezra Miller as the older Kevin was quite impressive - he played psychopathic well, without ever becoming clichéd. John C Reilly was perfect as a foolish, liberal parent. Whilst watching, I wondered why he and his wife allowed the child to behave as he did for years. As far as believability, it was difficult to suspend disbelief and buy into the fact that these attractive children were the offspring of Reilly and Swinton. Also re: believability, why the character of Eva stayed where she was and was treated by others as she was made absolutely no sense. Save yourself time and feeling anxious and skip this film.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
305,charmainewongtszwing,"A very intense film, it's even scarier than a horror film",9,4 May 2020,"A very intense film. The story consists of two parallel storylines, one after the happening of 'the event' (I don't want to ruin the movie for those who haven't seen it) and one describing the relationship between Kevin and Eva from the start. The two storylines make you kept wondering and picking up clues of what horrible thing had happened that leads to such a miserable life for Eva at the same time. I basically hold my breath for the whole movie.The movie was presented in a dream-like way. With the help of these nightmare-like effects, Tilda Swinton (Eva) was great in portraying her personal struggle of how to be a loving mother to Kevin whom she was afraid of and the anxieties she was facing every day. You can easily relate to her character. Another highlight of the movie was Jasper Newell (young Kevin), the way he looks straight at you just creep me out a little bit.This psychological thriller was more of a horror film, it is even scarier than a horror film, I must say. After all, humans are the scariest and most horrible creature in the world, who I'm saying here wasn't Kevin but the public. Although we had little knowledge of the whole picture, we just couldn't resist standing on the moral high ground and judge others. We had no idea of what harm we are bringing to the ones involved or it is simply not one of our concerns. In the movie, the public often judges Eva for her sins of raising a devil-like child, without knowing that Kevin behaves like this since he was at a young age, it might be a psychological disorder. Eva had tried to love him but she couldn't help herself to be afraid of him. She tried doing her best in being a mother, yet the public was not only marginalizing her but also physically harming her. That's horrible because they are doing terrible things to her without knowing that they might be wrong. Kevin also doesn't know or care about the impact but he had an anti-social personality disorder (I assume) as his excuse, so what's ours?",We Need to Talk About Kevin
306,elovette,A timely movie about autism and also about school shootings,10,23 February 2020,I had to watch this movie a second time to better absorb it. The movie utilizes many flashbacks so the first viewing can be a little confusing. But I understand why the director used the flashbacks. The flashbacks juxtapose her life after the tragedy with her life before the tragedy. And it wasn't just one tragedy. In truth this poor lady had a whole series of tragedy to deal with because of her son. The movie hints that her son may have autism and also he appears to be a sociopath..meaning that he simply does not and can not have any empathy for another human being.My take on this movie was that he for some reason hates his mother beyond all reasoning and that is what motivates all his terrible actions. I really felt bad for his mother but I also felt sorry for Kevin because he clearly had severe mental illness and was on prozac for depression. Just a tragic story but so timely for these days of Columbine and Sandy Hook.,We Need to Talk About Kevin

They changed key elements that were in the book, like him having a long-bow instead of a cross-bow. References to Robin Hood are in the film which I don't remember in the book. The mother's final scene with her son misses their key exchange. In the book she asks why he didn't kill her. He answers ""When you're putting on a show, you don't shoot the audience"". The mother in the book comes across as strong, even after what she has gone through. In the film, she is portrayed as a nervous wreck from the start. The father (as in the book) is a bit of an idiot.

There was no suspense, no emotion and no real storyline.Having read the book I knew what was going on, but this was an incredibly poor telling. It doesn't convey Eva's thoughts (central to the story) and it misses out A LOT of crucial stuff (for those who have read the book, his preschool escapades, the school dance, the bike, the bridge, the photograph, and so on.)

310,craignorm,A compelling and interesting independent film.,7,8 December 2011,The film is essentially about a Mother coping with the fact that her Son killed many of his fellow high school colleagues in a 'high school massacre' style that we see all too often on the news of a late.It accounts the repercussions suffered by the Mother in the aftermath of the massacre but more so the sons upbringing and the interactions between Son and Mother. The film is presented in a non linear aspect. It starts off a little confusing and disjointed at first but the deeper in to the film I got the more compelling and unambiguous I found it.What I liked about the film is how it managed to slowly build up a picture of why he did it and who's to blame. The whole nature vs nurture argument is kind of the backbone to the film and is put across very well indeed.Overall this film will appeal to some people but not to others. From my point of view it is a worthwhile watch which should give the viewer a lot to think about.,We Need to Talk About Kevin
311,hurley_chic182,"The most ""real"" portrayal of an evil child",9,11 February 2012,"There are countless movies with the plot of an evil child. This is the first one I've seen that I found to be completely and utterly 'real'. It's a gripping and thought provoking film. We see how Eva (Tilda Swinton), the mother of Kevin (who went on a killing rampage of his high school), is forced to live with the consequences of what her son did. People treat her as though she is responsible for her son's actions, continuously punishing her, and she takes it without dispute. We continue to follow Eva through her memories of Kevin. Starting with conception and pregnancy, she seems less than thrilled whereas her husband Franklin (John C. Reilly) couldn't be happier. As Kevin grows, so does his and his mother's resentment towards each other (insert the chicken or the egg theory here). Her husband on the other hand gets along perfectly with Kevin. Through Eva's flashbacks we see Kevin as a monster, and it's not an expression in this case. He is manipulative, he displays many traits of a sociopath from an early age, but only his mother seems aware. And he treats her with pure contempt when they are alone, yet fooling everyone else into believing he is a good and decent person. She desperately wants to find something wrong with him, hoping for some sort of cause to his actions. The viewer is left to contemplate Nature vs. Nurture. Is the way Kevin was brought up, and how he reacted to and interpreted his mother's feelings towards him the reason for his sociopathic tendencies? Or was he born that way, and that's why his mother is the way she is? Despite the way he treats her, she never stops trying to reach him. I think she wants to be capable of loving him, and truly tries, but at the same time she hates him for who and what she knows he is.This is the first film I have seen by director Lynne Ramsey, and I will definitely seek out her other works. I am not a fan of Tilda Swinton, but this is the best performance I have ever seen from her. I wanted to sympathize with her character, yet at the same time I was so frustrated and angry with her for constantly holding out hope for the hopeless. Why she was not nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actress in a Leading Role leaves me dumbfounded (But then again, I feel like the Academy really missed the mark in a lot in the nominations this year). All the actors who play Kevin through his various stages are tremendous and extremely believable. They make me absolutely fear what Kevin is capable of and hate him for it. We Need to Talk About Kevin strives to be a perfect film, and it comes extremely close. It shows that everyone involved gave this movie their all. Definitely a must see!",We Need to Talk About Kevin

From the beginning to the end I could feel the tension that encompassed this entire film. The noises played throughout to foreshadow events were eerie, and sound exactly like how someone would remember the sounds during a horrible event that plagues their mind. The use of this was very effective in my opinion. I would also like to say that this movie was probably one of the few perfect ones I've ever seen. The cinematography was entrancing, the soundtrack was delightful to contrast with the horror the film produced, the direction was right on and the acting was amazing, not a one seemed like they were out of place for the roles they took on.

Hence the problem with the film.(Short note) - I haven't read the book but from what I understand it is more evenhanded with the battle between an unprepared mother and a difficult child. I will endeavor to read the book.Back to the film, the kid is just too much, too much hate, too much aggression, too much...well too much. Most normal parents would have put the kid into a mental hospital. If not kill the kid.That shouldn't distract from Swinton's performance, which is very, very good.

314,delasernarje,And God created man by his own image...,10,9 October 2014,"""We need to talk about Kevin"" is enough bizarre, surreal and dark to be considered a classic for every person. That's why it is really complex and it may look sort of incomplete; but it is not.The movie is completely authentic and artsy, and the director is showing something that is getting very common nowadays. This story is about a woman (Eva) who doesn't want to have a baby, and less if it is a boy. Kevin is the ugly and very hollow creation of a narcissistic mother who never wanted to be a mother, cause she just wished to reach all her goals, like traveling around the world.Kevin is strange, and is always so hateful with his mother. He needs attention, attention from both: a very weak father, and a cold and distant mother. And he's gonna get it, not mattering what he has to do so.It's such a very disturbing story based on lots of terrible and sad others that may not be this tragic, but they exist. Women are not mother for nature; some of them just want to be what they wish to be, but sometimes that doesn't mean being a mother.The name of Eve, and the scenes with Tilda portraying a kind of crucifixation position really demonstrate it.The story unfolds amazingly, always keeping the pace to a very good tone. The cinematography is also brilliant (overall the use of red colors for a variety of the scenes). And, about the acting, well.. Swinton and Miller really deserve to be respected for this film.The story really reminds me of the story of Narciso, the young and beautiful guy who was damned to never look at his own reflection, if he wanted to live longer. He was soulless and cold with other ones because they were all around him. Product of a terrible and violent action; when he reaches to see himself in the reflection of a river, he fell in love with himself, as an object, and he died by negligence.I loved the way they made Tilda and Ezra look really alike, like two parts of one person. And, the last scene was amazing; Kevin had changed, he was bald, and he doesn't even know why he did it now.. he thought he knew. But now he is different, he is not anymore like mommy, he is finding out he just did...Terrible, but brilliant.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

Maybe an intentional move so Ezara Miller wouldn't be out-staged in his role of twisted young Kevin.We all know Kevin is a loony coming into this movie, so I'm not sure who is on the edge of their seats expecting plot twists with the erratic order the film unfolds in.

It kept me interested through out the duration of the film, unlike most of the mass produced crap that is cranked out into theaters these days. This is a film that really sticks with you, Kevin as a character will haunt you. Tilda Swinton and Ezra Miller were phenomenal in this film. However, I felt that John C. Reilly wasn't the best fit for his part. Don't get me wrong, it's not just because I see him as a comedy guy (I thought he was great in Magnolia,) something about his roll just seemed off. Don't let that deter you from seeing this film, though, as his part really isn't that significant.

Stylistically, it achieves so much more than other purely artistic recent films such as Shame which is equally depressing but much less fulfilling in my opinion. It makes you feel terribly for the heroine Tilda Swinton, who produces a multi-faceted performance which transcends the more obvious ice-queen role in the Lion, the witch and the wardrobe series. This pulls on Tilda's acting strengths unlike any of her other films, ably assisted by a commonly type-cast (but he does such a good job in these type of roles) John C.

In the case of first: the novel by (Ms) Lionel Shriver: I cannot imagine how she could have thought of let alone written this? But the second: the film is an 'edge of seater' drawing one in scene by scene with its' flashes back and forth; despite these being, at times, confusing - as it is hard to age the actors – the effect is extraordinary. I would not watch this genre from choice and indeed I did often want to give up and delete it but I stuck with it and was rewarded. Well done to Lynne Ramsay and Rory Kinnear (now her husband) Thank you BBC both BBC films for the film and BBC TV for showing it. Downloaded from BBC and watched on iPad. Moving to the latter - '12 year old lifer', a docu- mentary or drama?, shows that the film fiction is not that far from real life – Colt, although clearly influenced by all three: father, mother and stepfather – must surely be evil at his core to so coolly recount his killing of his stepfather with NO remorse; and also his influencing and leading his supposed friend into the same crime.

As we left the theatre I felt as if I was still completely immersed in the story I had just viewed. It was clear from early on that the child in focus, Kevin, was psychopathic and highly manipulative at that. You quickly starts to apply his this trait in his project Mayhem; to tear his own family apart and eventually leave it utterly destroyed.

It goes on and on. It becomes clear it's someone's dream. The viewer becomes impatient. Still, it continues.When the scene finally ends, it gives way to not one, but a series of flashes of very different scenes, none long enough to make any real sense. Eventually, like a child being disciplined, it becomes clear that you need to sit still and take it. You're not going to get any quick or clear explanations. You settle in for the long haul. You hope the payoff will be worth it. It is.Tilda Swinton is just extraordinary, in a role that can't have seemed even possible to play when reading the script. She's the mother of a teenage boy who has done about the worst thing a teenage boy can do.The other performers, notably Jasper Newell and Ezra Miller as the child and teenage Kevin, are exceptional as well. John C. Reilly is also excellent, but we don't as much of him, though it's hard to know whether, or how much, that contributes to what finally happens.The movie has no easy answers, no answers at all in fact, for questions that almost surely have no answer. How much discipline? How much love? How much is nature, and how much nurture? Can a boy be born bad? Can people living in the same household live in different realities?Instead, it spends its time exploring these people, giving substance to things that can ordinarily only be talked about and never embodied—this particular boy, this particular mother, these other family members, and those other mothers, whose children were the victims of this particularly horrific event.There is nothing wasted, nothing extraneous, in We Need to Talk About Kevin. Events unfold in three chronologies, shuffled like decks of cards (once the three stories sort themselves out, you're never confused about which you're watching): Kevin and his mom, from his birth onward; mom, and eventually Kevin, on the horrific day; and mom, and eventually Kevin, in the frozen, undead days and months that followed.Tilda Swinton's portrayal of a woman dragging herself through one day after another, in the shell of her former self, has to be seen to be believed. This story needs to be seen, not to be believed—nothing can make the unbelievable believable—but because it at least makes it it see-able. Few movies try something this hard.

It manages to differentiate itself from it's peers by focusing not on the child in question but rather on the mother and her perspective as she copes with raising her difficult child and then dealing with the fallout from their actions.As many other reviewers have stated, the real gem in this film is Tilda Swinton's performance. Every move, every expression, every word uttered seems to come straight from the soul of her character and she is utterly believable in every respect. I haven't felt this sympathetic towards a character in a long time.My only complaints are that perhaps ""the bad seed"" schtick is played up too much. It feels like overkill at some points and Kevin seems almost like a caricature of a sociopath rather than a performance of one. I also didn't like the archery touch. Maybe I missed the meaning behind that - at first it seemed innocuous and a bit foreboding when it's introduced into the plot but then when it's included in ""the incident"" I felt like it was a bit cheesy.Any faults this film may have however are overwhelming overshadowed by Tilda Swinton's performance and that alone makes this film worth viewing.

Red everywhere, a huge crowd of shirtless people all shouting--until you realise that it's simply a tomato festival of sorts. And then we see Eva Katchudorian (Tilda Swinton) crowd surfing, smiling and in total bliss.That was all before when Kevin came along.Lynne Ramsay's 'We Need To Talk About Kevin', based on the novel by Lionel Shriver, is bold and daring. Not only do most people shiver at the thought of having a sixteen year old murderer as a son, but this film just takes it to a whole new level, as we begin to doubt Kevin (Ezra Miller) and his motives the second he arrives on screen. Told in flashbacks and mostly through Eva's thoughts, we get a glimpse into her past, happy life, her painful years as a mother to a young Kevin and finally when she's going through emotional breakdown after finding out what her son has done.The strange thing about this film is that Eva and her husband, Frank (John C. Reilly) never actually have a serious, full discussion about Kevin. Frank is lying to himself without knowing it, trying to convince himself that his family is normal and happy. Even when Kevin comes along with a large amount of bicycle locks, Frank doesn't doubt him one bit--but we do, and the thing Kevin uses the locks for just makes us close our eyes and grimace.The whole film ties up together neatly with string at the end but nevertheless left me in shock. I stared at the screen as the credits rolled, not quite sure what to think.

She struggles with an act of vandalism that happens at the beginning of the movie, and the red paint that she removes throughout the movie, as well as the general refurbishing of her house, works as a symbol at various times in the movie. There are also scenes comparing Eva's life before and after the event. She once lived in a sparkling-clean, posh house with lots of windows and worked as a travel writer. Now she lives in a dark, rundown house with leftover plates of scrambled eggs lying around and works at a travel office where one of her main duties is photocopying. She's gone from being a confident, put-together woman to one who's fraying at the edges.Eva is a flawed person and what her son did was incredibly awful, but it's hard to believe all of the abuse that she is subjected to in the course of the movie. My biggest question is why did Eva stay in that town where everybody knew what happened? Maybe she wanted to stay close to her son who's locked up nearby (she's shown visiting him periodically during the movie where most of the sessions are silent and she sits with a blank face). Maybe she just feels like she has to punish herself for being the person who gave birth to such a monster.Throughout his childhood, her son Kevin shows the classic signs of a sociopathic personality: he screams constantly as an infant, is incredibly late to toilet train, shows no empathy, and abuses those who are smaller and helpless under him. (A lot of his behavior reminded me of how Nancy Spungen's mother describes her early childhood in And I Don't Want to Live This Life.) Kevin is also a master manipulator from a very young age and plays his parents off each other perfectly. Daddy (John C. Reilly) is the good guy and only sees the happy faces that his son puts on in order to get what he wants. It's Eva who sees what really lies beneath, but even she can be played by Kevin. When he's sick and Eva takes care of him, Kevin is entranced by a book that she reads to him, and it is the one moment in the movie where Eva nurtures her son and he allows her to do it, even extending the moment with his mother by locking his dad out. Later, it turns out that this story time only served to provide Kevin with his weapon of choice.Both the actors (Jasper Newell and Ezra Miller) who play Kevin as a young boy and teenager are wonderful. If you thought Damien was evil in The Omen, wait until you get a load of Kevin. Tilda Swinton is equally able as his mother Eva, showing love and hate for her son before the tragedy, but after, her face seems to be a blank slate as she drifts on autopilot trying to put the pieces of her life back together. The only time that she seems to react is when she encounters victims of her son and then her primary emotional response is shame. And I think this is how a woman in her situation would act.There are visual and sound motifs used in the movie that some might find a little heavy-handed, but I really liked them. I thought they gave the movie more texture and made it meaty. Actually this whole movie could be taken apart as a piece of literature. There's comparison and contrast, symbols, motifs. But I doubt a high school teacher would be able to get this movie on a syllabus with its dark and twisted themes. A pity since it would provoke so much discussion.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
333,azn_3004-865-192938,We Need to Talk about Kevin is a Movie without a Point,1,13 November 2014,"I did not like this movie at all because of the direction. I have not read the book, so don't know how closely movie follows the book. This is one of those movies that never makes up its mind what it is really about; director Lynne Ramsay never makes up her mind regarding the point or purpose of the movie. Was Kevin born bad or was mother Eva an unloving mother? The ambivalence of this issue wrecked the movie, making it a movie with no point at all. The excessive flashbacks and forwards are very disruptive and break any potential emotional engagement the viewer may have with the characters. The ""artsy"" quality of the movie was a bad choice on the part of the director and further break any chance of really getting involved with the characters and the storyline. This could have been a great movie but was ruined by Lynne Ramsay's very amateur direction.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

After I finished watching it, I couldn't help but feel some pity for Kevin. Of course, he is fully responsible and deserves the consequences for his decisions, but Eva influenced the person he became. I think it was partially Eva's fault that he became the person he was. She didn't want to become pregnant with Kevin and she wasn't prepared to care for him. There was never a bond between them and Kevin felt her dislike towards him since he was a baby. She didn't love Kevin and often said directly to Kevin as a child that she preferred to be traveling than taking care of him. This made Kevin resent Eva and seek her attention in any way, which was through provoking her. Eva should have gotten Kevin therapy in his early years, disciplined him, and confronted him early on about actions by asking why.The directing was great in many ways, I really liked how the color red was included in almost every shot and scene that Eva was in to show how Kevin's actions constantly affected her.

340,rickcote,"extraordinary filmmaking, very disturbing",9,25 September 2011,"I saw this film at Telluride by the Sea (Portsmouth, NH) prior to its general release. This is not a film I would choose to see normally, based on its subject matter. However, as a festival-goer, this was what was offered for the late evening screening. This film is visually stunning, and masterfully composed. You know early-on that a Columbine-style ending is inevitable, nonetheless hope that some miracle may yet occur to avert this disaster. Swinton is absolutely magnificent (as always) as the mother desperately trying to cope with raising a psychopathic child, but equally impressive are the performances of the actors who portray the developmental stages of Kevin from early childhood to the brink of adulthood. What elevates this film is the visual and musical narrative that accompanies the initial time-skipping introduction and then the more linear progression of Kevin's growth to its final, terrible conclusion. Interestingly, the emotional crescendo of the film occurs not near the end when Kevin carries out his horrific violence, but rather in the middle of the film at moments when we observe the impossibility of living a ""normal"" family life with a child who is incapable of feeling or expressing the human emotions that bind us together.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

344,mentazon,We need to talk about a huge disappointment!!!,2,20 December 2013,"I had really been looking forward to watching 'We Need to Talk About Kevin' but after watching it I realize that it definitely wasn't worth looking forward to watching. All the glowing reviews in various newspapers and online lead me to believe that it was a movie that gives an important insight into the mind of psychopathic child and his relationship with the world around him. Unfortunately that's not what we get.Instead we get introduced to Eva/Kevin's mother played by Tilda Swinton whom we see in a multitude of flashbacks and in various stages of despair. At one point shes is traveling the world for a travel magazine and later after Kevin's reign of terror has been played out she is trying to to make ends meet by working a low level job. That's where the problem with this movie lies, we are constantly bombarded with images of Eva trying to cope with having a difficult child and/or a child in jail.The movie never really bothers to tell us the real story of Kevin and why he ended up the way he did. Its almost as if the story of Kevin plays second fiddle to the seemingly endless scenes of closeups with Tilda Swintons face in various stages of pain,sadness and despair.By the way i am not trying to be nasty but let's face it Tilda Swinton is not one of the worlds prettiest actresses so it kind of unpleasant to watch all those scenes of closeups of her face.I have almost come to the conclusion that there must exist two versions of this movie. One consisting of random clips of Tilda's face in agony and another one that is a really good psychological drama about a positively evil child and his relation with his mother. That's the only way I can explain all the glowing reviews.To be fair some of the actors did a really good job considering what little they had to work with. Unfortunately that is not enough to save this huge disappointment of a movie.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

I was hit by a brilliance of color and a tableau of events moving back and forth in time. Excellent casting, excellent metaphors, excellent camera-work, excellent writing, but the story was not only depressing, the bulls eye, the center of attention, the whole forward motion of the piece, was in the wrong direction.

Like Eva, I am also a mother of a troubled son, who for some reason I think was just born 'difficult' and 'self-destructive'. Its very hard to parent such a child so I could very much empathize with Eva's situation. Unfortunately society does not help in assisting parents with difficult children and most of the time they accuse you of overreacting. Let this film be a lesson to all allied health care workers, in that a parent does not just imagine things! I would give the film 9 out of 10. I really found Franklin to be irritating - some men tend to live in denial. Eva in a way was a martyr in that she should have been more firmer on Kevin, she was far too ambivalent in her parenting style and Kevin knew from an early age that he could get away with things.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

349,dpw6,A chilling descent into one woman's personal hell that is as thought provoking as it is disturbing,10,2 August 2012,"We Need To Talk About Kevin. Is there a better title for this film; one that encapsulates everything that we need to know about the picture? A gripping descent into one woman's personal hell; to say that Lynn Ramsay's film is not afraid to explore some taboo subjects, albeit in a extremely dark and disturbing manner, would be a colossal understatement. Here is a film that is not afraid to explore the true dark recesses of the human mind, one where even the love between a mother and a child is hinted at to be an illusion that can be shattered with horrific ease with the smallest of effort. However, don't be fooled into thinking that this is some sort of film trying to preach a nihilistic message. Rather, it is simply a film that desires to show the place of hatred and violence in everyday life, and ask us to acknowledge some very dark ideas about its story, its characters, and even ourselves and those around us.We find ourselves following a woman (Tilda Swinton) whose life has completely fallen apart. She lives in a ramshackle home in a state of disrepair. She walks through experiences in a zombie like state of shock. One morning, she finds the outside of her home to be doused in blood red paint, by neighborhood vandals for reasons unknown, but clearly with dark intention. Out on the street after applying for a job, a woman runs up, belts her, and roars ""I hope you rot in Hell!"" Whatever happened to this town, Eva is somehow linked to it, something that was so traumatic that it left the poor woman's life in shambles. Eva has constant flashes of her past, and we come to realize that she is having these flashes on purpose, in order to try to come to terms with something deathly serious, something that she may be directly responsible for.We see her fall in love with a man (John C. Riley) at a young age, and their eventual marriage. We see her pregnant, but also notice a dramatic change in her demeanor. She doesn't crack a smile throughout her term, and we begin to wonder if, despite her husband's enthusiasm, she is having second thoughts. Regardless, she eventually gives birth to her son, the titular Kevin. Expecting raising a child to be a simple process, Eva is caught off guard when Kevin turns out to be anything but. Kevin screams so much as a baby that she eventually resorts to stopping his carriage close to a rattling jackhammer in the streets to gain some refuge from the noise. She puts on a clearly fake smile when trying to comfort her shrieking child, and seems close to losing it. As a toddler, Kevin barely improves, and reveals a new side to himself: an unconditional hatred of his mother.Kevin glares at her with fiery resentment almost every moment of her presence. He refuses to play games with her, or call her ""Mommy"" despite being able to talk. As she is driven to her wits end, it becomes clear that the resentment is mutual: finally, at one point, she announces to Kevin in a mockingly coo voice that she would frankly rather be in France than changing his diaper. The feelings fail to ever subside, and Kevin seems to grow worse with each passing year. As a boy (Jasper Newell), Kevin makes the average brat seem like a model child. He develops a habit of acting like a normal happy boy around his father, and staring coldly at his mother when his back is turned. Eva is continually one-upped by Kevin in various incidents, and through brutal manipulation comes to fear her own son.We Need To Talk About Kevin is many things: a gripping story about a mother versus her evil son, a reflection of the hell that can be found in everyday suburbia, but most of all it is a film that asks us to analyze the place of pure, unconditional hatred in human existence, and wenether or not this capacity of emotion is with one from the beginning or a result of outside influence. Wisely, the film does not try to give us any answers as to why, but is rather fascinated with the who's, what's and when's. Eva hopes that Kevin's behavior, as his father puts it, is just a phase, and he'll grow out of it, and they'll live happily ever after, but she doesn't so easily fool herself. As Kevin grows into adolescence (now played by a sleazy Erza Miller), his habits grow from rage-inducing to outright sociopathic. He begins to resemble an almost demonic doppelganger of his mother, one that reflects every bad side of her being. The war between mother and son continues, and scenes of present-day Eva continually remind us that we are leading up to something very tragic that Kevin is clearly responsible for, as her weekly visits to Kevin in juvenile detention tell us.The mistake would be to categorize the film if you know Kevin's terrible deed before actually viewing it. Kevin's final act in the climax isn't a spoiler (although the film will have more of an impact if you don't know it ahead of time). Rather, the film simply presents itself, giving us a story that is incredibly powerful and claustrophobic at its surface, and deeply thoughtful at its core about the most basic of primal emotions. Rest assured, you will have plenty to talk about at its conclusion: Was Kevin's behavior the result of Eva's ambivalence towards motherhood, or is he simply evil incarnate? To what extent can we forgive ourselves and move on with our lives? We Need To Talk About Kevin asks all of these questions, but never answers any of them, and for once in filmmaking history, that makes the film all the more haunting. Be ready; you will definitely need to talk about Kevin once the credits start rolling.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
350,alan-of-amersham,Very Disappointing,3,24 October 2011,"Perhaps having read the thought provoking book did not help; though I feel the interminable jumping around may be worse if you have not. Or perhaps knowing what happens makes all those red scenes (how many more items/situations could they find to be red?) seem a little too trite. Or perhaps the far too drawn out (& fairly meaningless) cleaning the house scenes (only there to provide flashbacks)seemed, well....meaningless. Or perhaps the acting really did not cut it for me - the mother played the part as a real misery from almost start (ok not scene 1) to finish, not at all what I would have expected of the character.For me this film missed the point completely. The book poses a question about genes vs environment (are we born good/evil or is it upbringing); the film does not. The book has a few twists in the events because of how it is structured; the film does not.Possibly it is a difficult book & subject to adequately turn into a film. The book pulled you in.

352,carolynshoe,A sociopath flick for all the family at Christmas!,8,23 December 2011,"Tilda Swinton, that eyeliner-avoiding little minx, stalks her way gauntly through what takes a while to work out are various flashbacked stages of parenting hell. She is visibly, yet bravely, and often silently, being consumed by guilt, despair and anguish. She is also constantly bombarded by buckets of tomatoes and red paint (sometimes in what appear to be slo-mo dream sequences with interesting camera-work, and sometimes really). This is because her son Kevin was a sociopath from birth and has murdered a fair number of his high school classmates with a bow and some arrows, which doesn't go down too well in a small town. He also has a nice sideline in psychological torture of his mom (presumably why he left her alive - To Suffer!) The relentlessness of the suffering is (oddly) pretty entertaining, redeemed by chillingly truthful writing and performances and a beautifully conflicted soundtrack. La Swinton does her brittle brave-faced thing as a mother goaded beyond endurance (as most mothers are at some point, let's face it) and all three Kevins (toddler Rock Duer, 6-8 year-old Jason Newell and teenage Ezra Miller) are impeccable.Writer and director Lynne Ramsay also made the excellent Morvern Callar (2002) and clearly has no truck with moral ambiguity or sociocultural explanations - the woman wallows in Evil, indeed lingers over it. She takes her sweet time getting to the point, and when she does she gives us nothing to leaven the bleakness. Almost nothing. Great film.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

354,soumer-mariem,an outstanding masterpiece,9,29 March 2012,"we need to talk about Kevin is simply a masterful achievement in filmmaking, acting, and writing. It is the story of a woman, trying to ""pick herself up"", get back on track and reinvent her now shattered life after her damaged teenager son commits the irreparable. the movie centers around Eva's cold and opposing relationship with her son Kevin, and how it has turned into a relationship full of feelings of hatred, resentment and malignity over the past few years... It is an unhealthy kind of relationship that has affected her healthy attachment to her husband and daughter and changed her perceptions of human innocence and goodness. Through her memories, she revisits her past, questioning her presumed ""guiltlessness"" thinking if only she had done something differently, perhaps the catastrophe could have been prevented and things would not have gone so terribly wrong. Throughout the film I was constantly confusingly wondering : how could anyone hate his/her mother that deeply and horribly? of course by the end of the film the answer seemed simple and quite clear actually : he does not hate her. he never hated her. he may have believed he did but the truth is at the very end, although it is mostly left up to the reader's interpretation, we realize that all along he was just afraid of the immensity of his love for her, and the immensity of her love for him, which is exactly why he has been pushing her away by showing her his detachment and by acting wickedly , to make her life a living hell. Him displaying no affection or responsibility to his family and community was just a clear evidence that he is not quite ready yet to love and be loved . his disturbed mind , his downhearted thoughts, and his strange behavior hide a certain need for affection and love which is a feeling that any normal child should be familiar with. It is a beautiful film about goodness, and evil...humanity and cruelty...love and hatred, led by mind-blowing performances from Tilda Swinton on the one hand (the actress delivers the best performance of her career and probably one the best performances of the whole year) and particularly the much talented Ezra Miller, on the other hand, whom you might want to memorize the name , because I am sure we will be seeing him a lot in the years to come.

At first, coming from someone who only read about 20 pages of the novel, the movie is very jumpy and a little hard to follow. It all comes together and becomes a ""disturbingly beautiful"" masterpiece of a film. Though this movie was fairly disturbing, it is very engrossing and keeps you waiting until the final scene.

I had expected a slow-paced drama, but instead I got more of a visceral, psychological horror.I'm not complaining of course. The film is full of images that pack a powerful punch, like for example the film's opening. It reveals in sort of moody states, but not all the time. The film goes from mesmerizing, dreamlike scenes to the more straightforward narrative, going from past to present. It does all of this incredibly. I also have to say, it evokes the same sort of images and feelings that only Lynch does in his films, and many times you can't help but be hypnotized. Yet, despite it's artistry, it also feels like it's in the middle between mainstream and art fare. This isn't a complaint at all, because I find it interesting when films can pull this off. In this, I find it similar to last year's Black Swan which also went between barriers this way, although this is definitely more serious and less over-the-top.But now, what about the performances? Of course, Tilda Swinton is magnificent. Her face is full of feeling. This is also not a wild, crazy role. It could have easily been a role that requires more in-your-face acting, more baity, but it isn't. It's an understated, subtle performance, even when the film isn't. Ezra Miller's role isn't quite as subtle, but it works here. Maybe if the direction had been subtle it wouldn't have worked, but both the direction and Miller stay in the middle, never becoming a parody, but never really being too quiet.Like I said, different than I expected. It feels like a genre film, yet still being very powerful and haunting. This is a visceral horror film, full of feeling, sound, and colors and one of the best of the year.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
361,samboltonok,"Disturbing, shocking, intriguing, mesmerizing, fascinating.",8,1 April 2014,"I gave this film an 8 out of 10 because there were some aspects of the film I liked and some I hated. For starters, the acting was superb. Especially to Ezra, who played the teenage Kevin- who murders loads of school children and his own dad and sister just to make his mum miserable. The point of the film is to shock mothers into being more aware of what their sons are doing. Especially what they order and why off the internet, and what there fathers are planning on getting them for Christmas. If Franklin hadn't taught Kevin how to shoot arrows, he may never have bowed down all those school children. The movie shows Kevin growing up, and how he hates his mum from the day he is born. The ending is thought provoking and dissimilar to the book. The downside to the film is the direction. The film is edited together in confusing little clips, which don't really follow in order. This makes the story very hard to follow. The music choice, as well, is appalling and not at all appealing to what horrors are happening. The music is often happy and jolly- creating the wrong atmosphere in the scenes. The movie though, as a whole, is a scary and terrifying look into a child's psyche, which will undoubtedly leave you puzzled and utterly frightened of what you are capable of.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
362,michael_johann_bauer,Really awful,1,29 March 2014,"I love thrillers, psycho-thrillers, especially if there is originality and they can surprise me. This movie didn't in any way. The mix of present and past just makes the movie unbearable boring. There are no real surprises at all. After the first 20 minutes it was perfectly clear what would happen/has happened. Then the situations with mother and young Kevin are just ridiculous. I'm working with children (and have experience with more than ""difficult"" ones): I don't expect a movie to be authentic in any way, but Kevin's behaviour is just cliché, nothing more, there is no deeper personality, it's just black and white. Summing up the content, I would say: the movie has no point at all, there is absolutely no tension, the people harassing the mother after the killing: pure nonsense. None of the characters is more than one-dimensional, this movie doesn't work in any way. At least this is my opinion and I wouldn't have written a review, if there wasn't this incredibly high amount of stars, something I don't understand in any way. Yes and I know giving one star seems to be just an angry reaction, but that's not true, I would even give this movie zero or minus stars, if possible: Because in relation to the money spent on it, the usually pretty talented actors (in other movies) etc. wasted on this piece of crap - sorry, but I think, there is not a better fitting expression -, this movie is beyond any proportionality.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

The whole cast is phenomenal; it's different to see John C. Reilly in a more serious role, Tilda Swinton nailed her performance as a distraught mother who would be in that situation, and Ezra Miller gave me good and bad chills. Lynne Ramsay displays a wonderful job building suspense, and gives the movie a disturbing feeling that makes us appreciate the lives we have (for most of us); and especially with all these kinds of events happening in the United States with mass shootings n' all.

365,justcoolyou,Psychological Portrait,9,25 July 2016,"This movie is a brilliant psychological portrayal of the lives of those living with a psychopath. The focus is not on Kevin himself, whose actions as he states himself have no reason (when asked why at the end of the film he confesses not to know), but rather on his mother and how he affects the rest of his family. The film has several strokes of genius: the non-chronological time frame which continually mirrors Kevin's mother's current state to her past, as though a justification for her current despair. As more flashbacks occur, we feel more empathy towards her. The tone of the film is immediately set when Kevin's mother does not enjoy her pregnancy. There is no doubt as to where this is going. There is a very interesting comparison between Kevin and his mother, who is not a very emotive person. He even states ""wonder where i got it from?"" during a key bonding scene in the film. The relationship between Kevin and his mother is the most fascinating thing in this film. She stays and supports him despite the fact he has destroyed her life, and has hated her from the day he was born. Throughout the film, Kevin is falsely loving to his father. And the stroke of genius is that, at the very end, Kevin is loving to his mother. This leaves us to wonder: does he respect his mother for being ""like him""? Psychopaths often lack respect for the most empathetic, such as his father. Or... is this simply the sign of another false relationship, does he plan to ""use"" his mother as he did his father once he is released. The suspense in the film does not lie in ""what did Kevin do?"". Even though this action is only revealed at the end, its fairly obvious throughout. The suspense is in trying to understand his mother, and what Kevin has done to her throughout his life. There is one masterfully played suspense, which is when we discover why Kevin's father and sister are no longer in the picture. That scene haunts for days and is truly surprising. Kevin is a delight to hate. We want to slap him throughout the film.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

The subject matter is not all that groundbreaking, however, and has actually been explored better by a campy TV show (american Horror Story). The only character that seems human is Tilda Swinton's. No one but her in this movie acts the way a human being would. Everyone else, from John C. Reilly's character, to the random people Tilda's character encounters day to day, acts like some kind of strangely programmed robot. ""Kevin"" is an absolute monster of the worst kind and that kind is boring. There is not a single spark of humanity in him and from the moment he shows up you just want him to die. That reflex in itself can be a very effective narrative tool, but here it's just annoying. He's mean ""just cuz"". He's the worst kind of edgy teen fantasy without a sliver of personality beyond his Omen-like manipulativeness and omniscience.The disjointed chronology used throughout the film tries to squeeze some mystery and complexity out of a very VERY straight forward and lame story that only plays out in the way it does because, again, every character behaves like an idiot. That complaint holds no water in a movie like, say, ""Friday the 13th"" or something, but in this movie the characters' attitudes are so perplexing it breaks the immersion.Kevin's mom is going crazy because she is the only sane person a world populated by crazies.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

It grabs ahold of you and wraps you in despair. You feel it with Tilda and you can see it radiating out of her. One should not watch this film with an anticipation of redemption, but rather, with reluctant acceptance of inevitable consequences that the protagonist must face. Consequences of actions not entirely her own, but influenced by her in some distant way nonetheless.But of course, the star of the show is Tilda Swinton. With any other actor, one could have freely called it the performance of a lifetime, but keeping in mind her ouvre, that statement should not be thrown so liberally. Her character invites you to try to withdraw emotional context from an incredibly broad spectrum of silence that modern cinema has arguably forgotten.As someone who has read the book I can say that the film adds to the characters and gives them context.

370,elsps,Please... do yourself a favor,4,1 July 2012,"If you saw this movie, please, PLEASE read the book. If you have not seen the movie, don't bother. Buy the book and read it. It's one of the most riveting, nuanced and terrifying books I've ever read. The movie adaptation was an artsy mish-mash.Granted, the book is 400 pages in paperback and covers a lot of time. It is written in epistolary style (in the form of letters from Eva, the mother, to her husband, Franklin). In these letters, she is reflecting on their lives, their marriage, and how things imploded after their son Kevin was born. You have a slow, leisurely build-up, progressing through the years, as Kevin grows from difficult baby to truculent toddler to monstrous teenager. You know something horrible is coming, but you can wait, because plenty of other horrible things happen along the way.In the movie, the epistolary style is eliminated and instead, it's a confusing mash-up of flashbacks, cutting back and forth so often and so disjointedly, the viewer often has no idea what's going on. I did, because I'd read the book, but my boyfriend had no clue half the time. Characters that were more fully fleshed out in the book (Franklin, and Kevin's little sister Celia) are pretty much one-note in the film, almost like afterthoughts. And so many other rich details are simply dropped, for the sake of keeping the film under two hours. ***SPOILER***In the book, for example, you get to know all of Kevin's victims in the school massacre, and why he chose them. He had special reasons for each murder and plotted things out thoroughly and carefully. In the film, the massacre is tacked on at the end and barely explored. None of the victims are identified, let alone fleshed out.The book delves into Eva's life before having children, her semi- hedonistic lifestyle and her ambivalence about becoming a mother. The movie reduces this to a couple of flashbacks of Eva and Franklin laughing in the rain, and Eva at some sort of event (which is never explained) where everyone is cavorting in a sea of tomatoes and sauce.I gave this movie four stars for the acting.

Anyway, apart from Tilda's peak performance there is actually no other good thing to point out, no matter how much I did like to see John C. Raily performing an absent parental figure; Swinton's mother is the only thing that kept me watching until the end. I have to admit, this movie had left me disappointed. It is not just the story has been unfolding in a clumsy way, but the whole script lacks a logical structure (how can you tell a story by leaving the audience without answering simple Q like: how come that supposed-to-be-mother didn't even once speak to her son in more than three lines, and then if we except that - how come there is no reason for mothers or sons behavior at all? In a good script everything happens with a reason.Besides,there is a very poor work on characters - except the mother everyone else seemed too flat and empty. I was wondering how can one write scenario on mother-child thriller without researching pathology within family dynamics? With all due respect, but for me it is a waste of time. If these two elements (complexity in script and more character work) would be done properly, the movie could probably have won more. I'll give it 5 out of 10.Cheers!",We Need to Talk About Kevin

If director Lynne Ramsay were to do a movie adaptation of the Mona Lisa, she would show partial images of the subject's nose, an eye and her right index finger.

Ramsay does a masterful job at creating the situation and giving the audience an opportunity to understand the reasoning behind the characters actions. The pacing might turn off people as well but I thought It was necessary for proper character development. Eva is the main character but the insight on Kevin is what really made the movie shine for me. It was also a delight watching John C. Reilly play a serious role. I watched him on the Tim and Eric show and a few other shows and really thought that role was his natural nature. I was wrong.

Tilda Swinton was always one of the most talented actresses, who gives amazing performance. This movie is not an exception - she is so realistic and breathtaking that i respect and like her even more after this role.Ezra Miller - is absolutely fantastic. He is so credible as Kevin- in his voice tone, in his eyes, the looks, the way he moves, his gestures. In my view, he is the most talented actor from the younger generation, who will have bright career in cinema industry not worse ( even maybe better) than Keanu Reeves, Joseph Gordon-Levitt or Johnny Depp. Even despite the rotten inside, Kevin( Ezra) is handsome, having perfect features and bone structure that its a huge difference between his inner and outer looks. I love that contrast actually and all that twisted sexiness that is pulsing from the screen while watching. Watched it 3 times already and every time i'm trying to get inside the head of Kevin, ""What you think? Why this or that idea came to your mind?"".

387,dajwright93,"This film is fantastic, so why is it so hard to believe?",7,14 November 2011,"There is one major problem in 'We Need to Talk About Kevin'; it isn't believable. Its believable in the sense that we know that this kind of thing happens all the time. Teenagers, for whatever reason, acquire guns and use them on their schoolmates to make a point about themselves or their lives. And this is the problem; the concept is believable - painfully so - but Kevin isn't. Kevin is a psychopath, rather than a sociopath, who is not autistic and appears to have inherited his psychological state of mind, rather than developed it. He is unable to feel safe with his mother during his earliest days and this later translates to a totally disconnected and paranoid relationship between mother and child. Kevin is in complete control of himself, he is highly intelligent, efficient, handsome, clinical. His actions are motivated by irrational hatreds and executed with total clarity. There is nothing redeeming about him, he is beyond the help of anybody because he conceals his true self from everybody but his mother. And yet, by the end, after two years of detention in a youth prison, Kevin displays empathy, and through this one scene, Lynne Ramsey completely destroys the film's very foundations by introducing a 'change of heart' which is out of keeping with the rest of the film, denies the basic premise that Kevin is a psychopath and is therefore medically impossible. Kevin shouldn't feel remorse, he shouldn't be questioning himself and unless he is continuing his campaign of mind war against his mother, which I very much doubt, he is a psychological miracle. Governments would love to know that previously incurable psychopaths could be reformed by a mere two years in prison, especially youth prison. So what are we left with? A fantastic film, but for the wrong reasons. If you are shocked by the outcome of the film, in the way that Ramsey would like you to be, then these holes in realism are forgivable. Besides, Tilda Swinton's performance more than compensates for Kevin's flawed characterisation, as does the breath taking cinematography - the film is beautifully shot and exquisitely produced. As a piece of film making, this one is spectacular. But as a story, what is it? Is it a political point, no. The weapon used is not a gun but a professional bow and arrow and the links that we can make to such shootings as Columbine are minimal, especially as the killers in that tragedy were far from psychopathic. Can we consider it a comment on motherhood? Well yes and no, Eva is put in the impossible position of nurturing a son who hates her uncontrollably and so our sympathy is always with her. The blame that is popularly associated with the mother when a child is disgraced is shown to full effect and is well and truly repugnant. But there is always the lingering guilt we feel about Eva's attitude towards her son, even as a baby. If the film is saying anything about motherhood, it is Kafkaesque. Tragic, but with a long shadow that leaves a bad taste. Perhaps the only real alley we can go down is the psychoanalytic one, but even then as I have already pointed out, Kevin's psyche is colossally flawed, and so a reading along those lines would be inappropriate. Ultimately what we are left with is a highly developed horror film, a mindless exercise in suspense and shock which is designed to provoke a reaction. But it shouldn't be like this, there is a real point to be made, intellectual and artistic capital to be gained from a realistic depiction of a child mass murderer. It is a fascinating film about a fascinating subject, but in being a sustained vehicle for horror - and with a predictable outcome - we are left feeling, not so much shocked, but confused. It all boils down to the end. The question 'why' is on every bodies lips, and Eva asks for all of us. Kevin tells us he is a false character, he changes from cold psychopath to Columbine murderer, a confused, obsessive teenager with no self confidence, leaving behind the rest of the film that we have all endured - and loved. There is a problem with Kevin. He is not real. Had the script maintained the level of evil throughout, it would have been a lot more powerful, and by far more 'earth shattering' to quote another reviewer. This is why we need to talk about Kevin, is there something else which Ramsey has left unsaid? What is Kevin; if he is not a fake character, is there more still left to be said?",We Need to Talk About Kevin
388,chasehill13,The best movie that i never want to see again.,9,9 December 2011,"This was a fantastic film from start to finish. No shot is wasted in telling this extremely disturbing story of a dysfunctional relationship between mother and son that ends in the inevitable devastation that ensues. Although it is fairly clear from the beginning how the film will end i was glued to the screen from the very first scene.The acting is brilliant by all but especially Ezra Miller who plays teenage Kevin. Swinton is fantastic as always and Reilly plays the somewhat dim father which isn't much of a stretch for him but it works perfectly for the film. I was amazed at how convincing the child actors who played Kevin during his various ages were. Kudos to the film makers for finding great child actors who all look very similar. The camera work and music were all nearly perfect and combined with great direction and a gripping story makes this one the best films i have seen in quite a while. Expect plenty of Oscar nominations for this one, and watch it a your earliest opportunity, but be warned it is at times very disturbing and not a movie you will soon forget.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
389,tim_macpherson,Flawed,4,15 December 2011,"This film is praised as an attempt to understand the development of a sociopath who ends up committing a high school massacre. In this respect it succeeds, mainly due to some good acting. But in other respects the film is disappointing: we found it pretentious, unconvincing and irritating.First, there are too many scenes involving dubious eruptions of various red fluids, supposedly to depict the mother's guilt feelings about recent bloodshed. These took up about 1/4 of the film, starting with the long dream sequence at the start, and annoyingly recurring every 5 minutes in the first half of the film.The opening dream sequence attempts some kind of surrealist street party vision. Unlike your average street party, everyone is swamped in a sea of tinned tomatoes. They revel ecstatically in the the gunge, especially the mother, who is finally carried Christ-like, through the seething mess.Unfortunately this scene is unconvincing. The main emotion evoked is despair, about the shocking waste of tinned tomatoes. Subsequently the flow of the film is, far too frequently, interrupted by scenes of mother painstakingly cleaning up loads of red stuff on her car & house, as apparently dispatched by angry neighbours to make her feel even more guilty. Apart from the boring nature of these scenes, it seems rather pessimistic to assume neighbours would act in this way, since she was only the mother, not the killer.Another mistake is that the ultimate deathly rampage around which the film is built, turns out to be fairly tame by American standards. Unlike well known cases, where the protagonist gains access to an arsenal of firearms, the film portrays a watered down version in which his only weapon is a bow and arrow. A better film would have acknowledged the problem of firearms, even if this was not the main theme. This ""bow and arrow"" plot line, leads to further problems, because the flow of the film in the final minutes is disrupted by questions about how a massacre could actually be accomplished with a bow and arrow. The final killing episode is confusing.There are other poorly depicted scenes in which the viewer is left wondering about issues that are not really worth wondering about. Such as: Mother is inside the house on halloween. She is fearful of halloween troublemakers so we expect bricks to come through a window or something, but no, its eggs breaking on the fridge. So she left the windows open? No, the windows were shut... Who cares.And another 10 minutes are wasted, wondering what happened to little sister's eye. There's a strong suggestion big brother did it, but we never know.From Tim & Brian (Masque Haunt Film Club)",We Need to Talk About Kevin

So unbelievable that the child was not diagnosed, we assume that was because of the inadequate health system in the USA.The mother was suffering from post natal depression and the father was blind with love for the child. Couldn't someone have picked this up. The child was so obviously playing parent against parent. Should have had a whack when he was little. Overall we wanted to leave in the first 30 minutes, but unfortunately we were with a big group of people and had to suffer the whole boring movie. My mother is 80years old and was concerned about child and parent abuse that was contained in the movie. She thought the whole family were in need of physcological help. They didn't appear to have any other family or friendships, so this demonstarated that they were social outcasts.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
391,paulverity,I liked it more than the book,8,10 October 2014,"Having read the book a few years ago, which I thought to be a complete misandrist piece of writing, I was really reluctant to repeat the experience with the film.However, I eventually did and was pleased to discover that the film maker replaces the authors misandry with over indulged child parenting skills. Even though I found this to be a bit over the top, are there that many parents who pander to their 5 year olds every wishes all the time?, I did find it preferable to the books misandrist rants to the dead husband who could never defend himself.And of course it is mainly about the nature of evil. Are they born or raised? What is happening now, as I write with the beheading's in the Middle East, certainly brings this to the fore. Are they born evil or raised this way. My own thinking is that as some children are born with incredible gifts and some with autism or Down's Syndrome, it's a lottery. Some children probably are born evil no matter who their parents are or their upbringing.In summary, I liked the film much more than the book",We Need to Talk About Kevin
392,luka-skare,Did we even watch the same movie?,9,4 January 2014,"Maybe too much people have read the book (I haven't) or maybe too much people read the synopsis, or maybe just don't understand...Throughout the whole movie we are observing a self-centered woman and her inability to realize there is something wrong with her. She is a very cold person who's not in touch with her son (both literally and emotionally) to a degree where she's not even able to hug him (that's the importance of the last scene, if you've been wondering) not even once in her entire lifetime...You need to touch, hug and cuddle your child. Notice how she avoids contact with him throughout the film. She doesn't even hit him, even though she wants to, and i think he could even settle for that, maybe that's on his mind when provoking her. But she gives nothing, just coldness, its eerie, how she can be like that, it made my skin creep... For instance when walking out of the room when the kid destroyed her maps on the wall...It's all there, what more do you need to understand? When pregnant she's never happy, upon birth she just holds her baby in front of her, never hugging it, cuddling or giving any real love and warmth to the child. The child grows up missing love and constantly provokes her constantly waiting for her to break down and hug him. EVERY SINGLE SCENE where you can see Kevin, he's just begging for her love. It was all about her... Everything he did, but she never could love him... He refuses to co-operate with her even as a young child, because there's nothing for him there, he doesn't need her approval, he needs her love...And he knows what he needs, but she just refuses to give in... From time to time she realizes he exists and tries to bond with him, but again, giving NO love or signs of love... It's all fake, she's not aware because she doesn't know how to love, but it's obvious and he sees right through it, he even says ""that's the most honest thing you ever did"" or something like that... I talk from my own experience, I could definitely connect to the poor guy. The ""Incident"" is only a decoy, the movie is not about that, that's why you almost don't even see it. They never sought professional help for him because it would let the skeletons out of the closet and they would have to face the fact she doesn't love him. The father does love him, but it's not enough, he is deeply emotional and deprived of motherly love, and it causes his shutdown, emotionally speaking...How are you people missing it? Are you just so gripped about ""the incident"" that you missed out on what the movie was all about? Go watch it again and you'll see it, it's obvious, every scene they're in. And that's why she's haunted: she is aware that she doesn't know how to love him. Everything could have been avoided AT ANY TIME, if she would only break down and love him, but she never could... Everything is more important for her than him.He even stands in front of her picture outside the library, only wanting his mother, to love him. Why are you people not seeing this?The movie was slow-paced, I felt the urge to skip through it but managed to restrain from it, and it payed off, it's a great one, i give it 8.5 out of 10 just because of stunning performances and subtle way the story is given. You're not spoon-fed here but don't let that be the motivation to grip to ""the incident"", the movie is not about that, or a problematic child, it's about what a lack of motherly love can do to a child, the rest is just for show...",We Need to Talk About Kevin
393,yourkiwibutterfly,Left disappointingly underwhelmed,5,9 January 2012,"Having devoured the book I wasted no time in watching the movie. I know it's clichéd that the ""movie is never as good as the book"" but in this case it was an understatement.The ONLY reason this movie gets the rating it does is because Erza Miller and to a lesser extent (for me personally) Tilda Swinton are amazing. I feel so let down by not only the visual elements of this movie but the emotional too. While reading the book I developed obscenely strong emotions and opinions towards all main characters, watching the movie I felt none of these connections. I went from adamant kinship with Eva and the devastation of abandonment delivered by Franklin to watching these characters on screen and it felt like I was watching strangers.The haphazard way the movie skipped over Kevins infancy left me wondering how anyone, without reading the book, would be able to identify with Eva's pain. This also applies to the shallow rendering of Franklin and Celia. With the majority of the films dialog being taken directly from the book I was confused as to why they would let these vibrantly decisive literary characters pale on screen. I felt little towards the relationship between Franklin and Kevin and likewise with that of Eva and Celia.I also found that time was ambivalent. Something that was so present in the book was lacking solidity. Erza Miller who as far as I can conclude played Kevin from ages 14-18 took on little, if any, physical changes during the movie leaving me to wonder if they had shortened the time line somewhat.I can't help but wonder if a viewer who had not read the book would be able to understand this movie at all. It felt like they'd skipped through the book taking segments out at various intervals and put them all together with little regard for filling the gaps.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
394,fvdheiligenberg,Absolutely gripping,9,29 February 2012,"From the first scenes of the movie I was glued to the screen. As the story is not told in chronological order, step by step it becomes apparent what has happened and is happening. Or actually, the story is not so much told: the amount of actual conversations that you get to see in the movie can be counted on one hand. And that is what makes this movie so powerful. The director clearly saw that such a gripping and emotional story cannot be captured in empty conversation. The silence, the looks, the faces; they tell all that needs to be told.As you, as the viewer, start to unravel and understand more of the situation, it becomes impossible to stop watching. The movie gets you on a sort of drug high - you continuously crave for more bits and pieces. A particularly good feature of the movie is the use of symbols and metaphors. They are a very powerful tool to lead to understanding.The story itself left me emotionally drained. It is not a movie easily forgotten.

No way possible! Even average movies that are boring I would give a 4 or 5. But this deserves a 1 or 2 at the highest. Pure trash. Super poor story line. None at all really. Acting? About what. There was no story. I am loosing hope for the movie industry to take good actors and put them in total trash movies. I cant even believe reviews anymore because they are most likely bogus now.

And surprisingly, the boy who played little Kevin was also really great. All in all, the best thing in this film was the acting. What I didn't like was the way of storytelling. The first 20-30 minutes of the movie were quite confusing (not in a good way). In my opinion, linear storytelling would have been better. The other bad point is not the movie's fault. Unfortunately I read the summary on a website which gave away too much so the film was very predictable to me. I think this is the main reason I couldn't enjoy it very much.

I want to relate to the characters, root for them, or at least understand them, think and talk about them after the movie. This was not a good movie. For two painful hours I was watching a freak tormenting his mother. Why? Who knows. We don't really see the characters developing, the son is mean throughout the film, the mother is putting up with it. It becomes annoying. Instead of trying to create boundaries and discipline her son, she is too much of a pushover. Some reviewers blame her for not enjoying early motherhood, but for me, she was way too passive later on. A normal person will not have a 6 year old in diapers. Nobody talked about Kevin, not enough, not with each other, not with the right people. Why didn't she seek a therapist's help? Didn't she have any friends? I stopped caring for her. And I never felt anything for the kid who was not slow, but just manipulative psychopath. Also, after the tragedy, why didn't she move to another place where she wouldn't be recognizable? Doesn't make sense. And the flashbacks reveal the ending too early.

411,gfswolf,A poignant take on the cause of mass killings,10,22 December 2015,"Lynne Ramsey, the director of We Need to Talk about Kevin, has given us a touching and insightful take on the development of a violent personality. The story is told from the point of view of the mother, excellently played by Tilda Swinton. It covers her relationship with her son from his birth onward, and portrays a mother who didn't want a son in the first place and how she relates to him in a cold, unloving way throughout his childhood. At one point, she throws him to the floor and breaks his arm. She constantly blames him for hating her without looking at herself and how she has treated him, which makes him hate her all the more. The film is told in a scattered way, going back and forth in time, which causes it to be hard to follow at some points, but is artistically moving. The incident at the end is shown indirectly, which has a stronger effect. I recommend this movie as a means to understand the increasing violence in our society.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
412,tairis_hunger,"""It's at the same time brilliant and disturbing.""",10,23 March 2013,"""We need to talk about Kevin"", released in 2011 by the director Lynne Ramsay, it's different from everything ever seen. Somehow, it's at the same time brilliant and disturbing; the kind of movie that after the end, you just need some time to think about it and process all the information. The story is about a mother, Eva Khatchadourian (wonderfully performed by Tilda Swinton) with a problematic son, Kevin. Through some time lapses, since the beginning we are prepared to wait for the worst. Slapped in the face, having her eggs broken in the supermarket, well, this is what is going to happen to you if your son becomes a psychopath. What it's really interesting is that, in the first minutes of the movie, her house is all painted red (probably by someone who truly hates her, which is normal where she lives) and it seems that she tries to purify herself by cleaning everything. Her hands, her face, every part of her gets red because of the paint, and it looks like, somehow, the blood spilled by her son is all over her. Early in the story, it's easy to realize that Eva was not ready to be a mom and it doesn't seem like good news to her. But would Kevin have been born bad or it was the creation of Eva and her husband, Franklin? The movie doesn't give us an answer, but we can imagine where it went wrong, sometimes. The plot is based on the always tense relationship between Kevin and his mom, and it goes between the present, when he is arrested, and past, that shows the family life before the tragedy. It's understood that something really bad happened, but only later we can understand what, how and the implications. Besides all the evil, this movie is going to blow your mind. It's the kind of movie that, for a long time, you are going to compare with other movies and think they are all weak. The whole movie prepares you to a top notch ending, which seems truly hard to find in movies nowadays. Despite everything, ""We need to talk about Kevin"" deals with the wickedness, brutality and cruelty in the extreme, but in a way that it seems to be natural. Can someone, like the mother, be blamed for the way her son behaves? It's not an easy movie to be watched, but it makes you think about things that you had never thought before.

Teenage Kevin is overdone. I actually found kid Kevin to be pretty good. None of the true motivations behind people's actions are explored. For example, a significant part of the book is about the (bad) reasons why Eva and Franklin decide to have a baby, this is then built on later when it turns out Kevin is not quite right as a child and into his teens. The timeline in unnecessarily befuddled. Worst of all, the most cinematic scene in the book (the revelation at the end) is completely mishandled, given away too early and fizzled out in a short frame. Very disappointing - if you haven't already, go read the book, you'll not only understand this better but it is also a fantastic read from an extremely intelligent and articulate author.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
416,bhutada-shruti,Haunting and Brilliant,10,1 March 2014,"This is one of the most disturbing and haunting movie I have seen in a while. I haven't read the book, but in terms of film-making; I think this movie exemplifies what a good movie should be. Brilliant acting, direction, script, editing. Every frame is perfect. However the sum of parts is bigger than the whole as this movie leaves one seriously questioning the choice to be a mother. The metaphorical element to the story, with non linear flashbacks might seem jarring in the beginning, until you realize that the sequencing is involving the audience as much as the characters and story is. Throughout the movie you feel a sense of dread about what Kevin might have done and why Eva's husband and daughter are not with her. You know the answer at the back of your head but the non linear sequencing teases your instinct to think again. In terms of acting: again this movie wins. Every single case member is brilliant. Its is sheer stupidity that Tilda Swinton did not win or get an Oscar nomination for this movie (showing how much that award cares about 'just talent' anyways). You can feel Eva's pain, horror, shock, disenchantment and depression; all through Swintons facial expressions and body language. The 2 Kevins are compelling too. Newell who plays the young Kevin; is innocent yet devious at the same time; and is so convincing that you find it hard to like this otherwise adorable and cute kid. As a grown up, Miller brings this contrast to its head, playing a calm, attractive, diabolical mad man. This was the movie that convinced me that Ezra Miller is probably one of the best actors in the up and coming generation. He is so controlled in his performance as Kevin, that for a while you like Franklin start believing all is finally good with Kevin. Yet his deviousness is understated but chilling. Worth mentioning are two scenes that left me disturbed for hours. One is the scene where he is talking with Eva, turning what appears to be a reconciliatory conversation into another one of his cruel pranks to undermine his mothers poise. Another is the scene where he is eating a fruit as Eva talks to him about his neglect possibly causing his sister to loose an eye. That is the only ""overtly creepy"" gesture Miller does in the entire movie. Yet every time he holds a bow and arrow, you find yourself getting goosebumps and hoping he would put it down. The support cast is equally compelling in their roles. Overall, a brilliant movie. But I don't recommend watching it if you are already feeling down. It stays with you and depresses you for a while...",We Need to Talk About Kevin
417,brel-99-814622,A bond of mutual rejection between mother and son,8,9 July 2017,"I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie. I have not read the book and while I would be really curious to read it, too, I would prefer to comment on what made the movie special to me.Looking through online reviews, the question that everyone seems to see as the most pressing is the nature vs. nurture one, the guilt question: Has Kevin's mum turned him into a psychopath (is she the true perpetrator) or was he one by birth (is she the victim)? and there seem to be equal amounts of viewers in both camps.For me the true topic cuts through this question, it's more about their relationship. Kevin only shows his true face to his mum, who becomes his complicit in his double life when the show he puts up for everybody else starts including cover-ups of her own parenting failures. He stages normalcy towards everybody else but he torments her, provoking her rejection which she readily provides, and thereby they form a secret relationship that is based on mutual emotional rejection, which is terrible, but at least it's not built on pretense. It becomes clear that he 'has it from her' in some sens of the word, and he is very aware of that. But it also is clear that she is quite high-functioning in most sectors of life including relationships, whereas he is deeply disordered, antisocial or a psychopath.Who cares if it's genetic or acquired, who cares which one of the two ""started"" their toxic way of relating to one another. Sure, there is the hypothetical question of what would have happened had she admitted her crimes (like breaking his arm) and sought help early on, but for me it's not the point of the movie. I see the topic here as the bonding and mutual acceptance of two disordered human beings in mutual rejection. In the end they only have one another. Because even when still alive, the lovely daughter and simple-minded husband don't 'get it', they don't get either of the two. This bond and how it's portrayed is really unique and special and very well done.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
418,con_louca,Kevin's Mother,5,2 February 2015,Actually the film is a spoiler from the beginning. The problem was Kevin's mother. She was watching the snake but she was looking for it's traces.There were no surprises at the end of the film. Is is possible for a 10 years old child to still wear baby nappies.? How can is possible a normal child to shoot his sister with the bow like Paris shoot Achilles? She let a 7 years old boy to blackmail her. The most amazing is the end. I don't know mother. OK the next time you can kill the whole town and say.. I am still thinking on that. As I have said before and I insist in that his mother was watching the snake but she was looking for it's traces,We Need to Talk About Kevin
419,naylor0524,Now I don't want a kid. (spoiler alert),8,19 February 2015,"I'm warning you about a spoiler. If you haven't seen the movie yet, please don't watch this review.This movie was indescribable amazing in some ways and reminds me of the movie about a psycho kid, ""Orphan"".I like all of the casts, especially the part of Kevin. Kevin is a main role in the movie as well as Eva so I wanted to know more about Kevin. I think the content of the movie focused on Eva too much like it's all about Eva. Even if he was a cold-blooded kid, it can't be the reason why he did commit mass murder. Telling his feelings would be perfect by far.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
420,kahareia,An austere specimen,7,23 May 2015,"Following a recommendation of a friend of mine, I decided to watch this film. From the very beginning it was incontrovertibly certain that this oeuvre would become a uncomfortable one. The subtly dark atmospheric sceneries and incorporation of time leaps are, as a whole, tremendously pivotal for the quality of this film. It's bedrock is undoubtedly to make the audience feel thrilling discomfort. The problem I had with this concept while watching the film though is that as soon as you start perceiving the individual elements creating this kind of rather scarce 'flavour', then this film will annoy you. In such a way that throughout most of the time the plot alongside its eerie components impedes its own buildup of excitement, preventing the audience from being thrilled, but rather hurts its own tension and makes its end unfathomably unsatisfying. Moreover, the ""silent whispers"" that are supposed to make you sympathise with Kevin (through the usage of the nowadays classical irrationally-psychopathic-villain-pattern) can, in my opinion, quickly backfire and mitigate the film experience with leaving you irritated. All in all, the wonderfully shaped surreal world where the film takes place along with the harsh reality you are always reminded of make ""We need to talk about Kevin"" unique, by tendency. More attentive and cautious audience though will be left with no more than a stupendous thriller with damaged capabilities.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
421,th-77822,Awful is an understatement,1,11 September 2016,So. This is it. My first review and boy oh boy I AM MAD. This movie was a waste of time if I've ever experienced one. It is basically 110 minutes of different shots of Tilda Swinton underlined with 110 minutes of annoying noises of all kinds. From the very start it's just pure chaos but not the chaos that leaves you puzzled and curious what is going to happen next - no. The story is 100 % foreseeable and the reactions and the character development is utterly predictable. For a movie that relies so heavily on it's characters it is just underwhelming. It stays super flat and not even the (granted - really good) performance by Swinton can save this disaster.Maybe all of that wouldn't be a problem if this film would be at least half way realistic but no not even that. I could think of a more realistic mother-child relationship from the top of my hat so I don't know where Lionel Shriver got her inspiration from but she certainly never had to deal with a problem child herself.I had really high hopes going into this film but after all I am more than disappointed and can't recommend this at all. 0/10,We Need to Talk About Kevin
422,beckyandcutie-97884,Brilliantly Acted and Directed but Ultimately Disappointing,6,29 January 2016,"We Need to Talk About Kevin centers on a woman's struggle to deal with the aftermath and her own conscience when her son commits a mass murder at his high school. Tilda Swinton plays Eva, the mom, and Ezra Miller is the titular Kevin. Both do a fantastic job of playing their characters, oftentimes not even needing to speak to communicate their emotions and thoughts. The story is told in one of the flashback kind of ways, clever editing, all that stuff.But I'm still giving it a 6 out of 10. Honestly this movie is incredibly disappointing. Because it is predictable, nonsensical, and, most egregiously, safe.This movie cast several Americans and is centered in America. And an adolescent commits a school massacre. Wow, completely unfamiliar territory in America. The fact is the movie had the chance to actually create a serious dialogue about adolescents who commit mass murder at their schools. To depict what the cause and effect of a tragedy like this might be. But the movie made no parallels between its fictional events and the actual real life tragedies that occur too often in American society. At best it's a wasted opportunity, at worst it's exploitative shock horror.The use of a bow and arrow was such a cop out, for example. Like I know that Kevin loves his dumb bow and arrow because his dad gave it to him and it's an insidious way to practice for later events, foreshadow, blah blah blah. But high school massacres are committed with guns, and a bow and arrow is comically unrealistic. So did they use it to avoid political controversy? And yes, I'm aware in the novel Kevin uses a bow and arrow, but faithfulness to the written material has never stopped a director before.All in all this movie is good, but it's not the provocative, stunning piece of cinema every critic says it is. I really think they didn't have to use something as serous as school shootings to show that Eva wished she had just used a condom and that Kevin has severe mommy issues.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
423,elenamartyn-28231,Gripping from start to finish.,10,27 February 2016,"Gripping from start to finish. A deeply affecting movie with faultless acting. So cleverly put onto screen - everything that you see or hear is there for a reason/has a deeper meaning. The movie consists of an intense build up to a truly tragic and dramatic ending. I leave this movie, speechless and deep in thought. I am extremely glad that I took the time to watch this movie, as it opened my eyes to a fresh, new type of film - one that I do not doubt required much thought and hard work. My mind was constantly engaged as the plot unfolded. I plan to watch We Need To Talk About Kevin again in the future as I believe it will be one of those movies that you see differently each time you watch it; noticing more details that add to the plot. Overall, an outstanding piece of film that I would recommended watching.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
424,lauriehargreave,"More of a ""visual accompaniment""",2,5 January 2019,"I was excited to see this movie, having just read the book, and immediately was on the back foot, trying to rationalize why the scenes were so scrambled. With no apparent reason or cause, the director/producer decided to jump around the story line, confuse the hell out of anyone who hasn't read the book, and make a mess of a fantastic story.
So many important plot points were skipped, which can be expected in a book to film transition, but there are holes left right and center in this film. Too much mundane time jumping around, not enough storytelling.
Was very disappointed in what I hoped to be an emotional and exciting film.",We Need to Talk About Kevin

Tell tale signs at an early age seemed to be noticed but not addressed. No parent wants to think their child is ' That bad.' Abnormal behavior should never be dismissed as a stage the child is going through. The acting by all ""Kevin's "" was spot on, the parents reaction is all too familiar, but unfortunately is the norm. When you were raised in a time where ""this kind of stuff didn't occur,""(or not talked about,) it's kind of hard to accept,or deal with it.",We Need to Talk About Kevin
