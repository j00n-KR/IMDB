0,claudio_carvalho,Pay Attention and You Will See an Intriguing Sci-Fi,7,10 October 2019,"In 1988, in Philadelphia, Police Detective Locke (Boyd Holbrook) and his partner Maddox (Bokeem Woodbine) hunt down a female serial killer. Locke kills her in the subway and the case is closed by his chief Holt (Michael C. Hall) without identification of the killer. In 2007, similar crimes happen and Locke and Maddox believe in a copycat. However Locke finds that the killer is the same woman he killed nine years ago. Locke becomes obsessed with the case along the years and Locke believes she travels in time in the opposite timeline. When the woman reappears nine years later, Locke is waiting for her.""In the Shadow of the Moon"" is an intriguing and original sci-fi with a good story. The slow pace is a problem and if the viewer loses a part of the film, he or she may not understand the plot. But if the viewer pays attention to the details, he or she may have a good surprise. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Sombra Lunar"" (""Moon Shadow"")",In the Shadow of the Moon
1,nogodnomasters,I have dead people waiting on me,6,12 December 2019,"Thomas Locke (Boyd Holbrook) is a cop playing detective in Philadelphia in 1988. There are strange killings happening with people being injected in the back of their neck and their brains bleeding out through their nose. Nine years, he is a detective and it is happening again, even though the suspect was killed.Plot Spoiler: This is a time travel, kill Hitler's parents before he was born type of film. The events happen every nine years as the moon cycle allows for time travel.This is a decent Netflix film. It was well done , but nothing to get excited over. Clearly it sees the far right as a danger to the planet.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",In the Shadow of the Moon
2,kosmasp,Some shadow it is,7,23 November 2020,"Overall the movie or the concept it presents is quite interesting. But it is also quite flawed. There are many things that do not work in its favor, especially towards the ending and when it comes to logic. I also thought this was quite predictable - at least for me, maybe you have a different viewpoint on that.Having said that and as you can see by my rating, I still found it entertaining enough. Technically sound (really well shot, good sound and all that jazz, minus actually jazz), it is let down by plot holes or the general problem movies with different time lines have ... does it make sense? I think not ... but if you blend that out, you can at least have some fun with it",In the Shadow of the Moon
3,CinemaSerf,"Sorry, but this is a bit of a howler....",5,25 June 2020,"Now this could have been a really good sci-fi thriller if only Jim Mickle had got the casting and the pacing right. Sadly, he didn't and what we end up with is a rather episodic story of a policeman on the trail of a serial killer. The difference is, the killings don't seem to have any rationale and the killer is privy to secret facts about ""Locke"" (Boyd Holbrook) that leads him to believe that there is much more going on than meet the eye. To make this work, this plot had to deliver us a sense of why this was all happening - at all, and to him in particular. We needed clues to engage our little grey cells. What we got though, was rather sloppy, no other word for it. We just don't ever seem to get up enough of a head of steam (partly due to the chronology of the narrative) to really get to grips with either the quite intriguing story, or the rather puddle-deep characterisations. Funnily enough, it might actually work better as a serialisation - but starting again, from scratch.",In the Shadow of the Moon
4,grantss,Initial intrigue quickly turns to dull derivativeness,5,29 September 2019,"1988. A police officer investigates a series of murders. The only thing connecting the victims appears to be the murder method. The police manage to piece together an image of the murderer from one of their would-be victims. Now the hunt is on.Was drawn to this by the trailer, as the movie looked like a good murder-mystery. Unfortunately, it turns out this is much more a sci fi thriller than a murder drama, and I'm generally far more into the latter than the former.This said, the movie still had potential, but this potential was wasted. It becomes quite dull and derivative. Throw in some twists for twists sake, plot developments that don't make much sense or are just there for empty sentimentality's sake, an irritating, unconvincing performance from Michael C Hall (of Dexter fame) and a tame conclusion and it is all quite unsatisfying.",In the Shadow of the Moon
5,Calicodreamin,"Kind of sad, not a happy ending.",6,30 September 2019,"The storyline is a little convoluted at times, the story focuses on a police officer who devotes his life to solving the murders of numerous people, they all died in the same way by the same person, but they only occur every nine years. The officer wastes his whole life on this, losing his daughter and living out of his car, and in the end for it all to be for naught. It was a very sad ending for multiple reasons, and I feel like with a few choice words at the beginning it literally all could have been avoided. Acting was pretty good, storyline thought out, and the characters well developed.",In the Shadow of the Moon
6,Wizard-8,"Good beginning, but then starts falling apart",3,17 November 2019,"It's going to be difficult to critique this movie without giving out massive spoilers, but I will try my best. About the most I will reveal is that the plot of the movie revolves around time travel, though I think the majority of viewers will realize that is going on in the first fifteen or so minutes. Anyway, you have to be pretty ingenious to make a time travel story plausible, and while the movie thinks it's pretty smart, it really isn't. As other IMDb users have pointed out, once you have watched the entire movie and learned what is going on and why, it doesn't make sense. It seems to indicate that time travel CAN work and CAN'T work. Not only that, the screenplay also falls far short with the narrative of the obsessed police officer going through the years, not explaining fully how he learned so much between acts. Also, there are glaring plot holes elsewhere, ranging from why the high tech device found in 1988 is never analyzed, why witnesses are not fully questioned after incidents, and also why the time travelling woman needed an airplane. Though I admit that the movie was not boring, the lack of clear and proper explanation prevented me from getting enough enjoyment.",In the Shadow of the Moon
7,phd_travel,What was that all about?,2,2 October 2019,I concentrated through the exciting chase scenes and then the lulls. When I got the Terminator like send back in time thing all seemed to be coming together. Also it was interesting to see Boyd Holbrook of Narcos age through the years. But ultimately the big let down at the end. Are we supposed to just accept the rationale for killing the people to prevent a bigger catastrophe without some details about what was being prevented? And how come she keeps coming back if she gets killed in the beginning? With this half baked ending it all felt like a waste of time. Guess I must be really dumb since I didn't get the point of this movie.,In the Shadow of the Moon
8,trashgang,weird one,8,17 June 2020,"Picked this one out of the blue on Netflix. Not knowing what it was going to be, no research whatsoever to see whats it all about.Glad that I have seen it, this was a hell of a ride. Starting as like a serial killer is out there this one turns into something like The Terminator. Excellent performances espescially from Boyd Holbrook. Great story that you can't see coming.Nice to see Michael C. Hall again, been a while.If you like your flicks weird then this is one to see. Not one boring moment.

9,siderite,"A mediocre time travel movie, starting from a disturbing premise",7,4 December 2020,"I have watched enough movies to know that I hate time travel. It is only used for two things: to make a bland idea seem smarter and to reboot things when they went sideways. In the Shadow of the Moon is part of the first category, and is in fact a mediocre detective film with a time travel theme. Remove that and it's boring.Now, the sci-fi theme might have improved the film if it made sense, which it doesn't, or if it wasn't based on a really disgusting concept which is painted as good by the filmmakers. I don't want to spoil the premise, but if you think about it it's the worst thing that can happen to humanity and it's presented as a solution to all problems. It is, quite literally, the final solution.Bottom line: it was not a bad movie, but it was not a good one either.",In the Shadow of the Moon
10,sddavis63,Not At All What I Was Expecting,5,2 November 2019,"This certainly took a turn that I wasn't expecting. I thought it would be a pretty straightforward movie about the search for a serial killer - the twists in it being that the serial killer was a female (unusual) and that the murders she commits happen every nine years (a strange cycle.) I watched it largely because one of the stars was Michael C. Hall - whose work I generally enjoy - but he wasn't really a particularly central character as it turned out. The lead was Boyd Holbrook (with whom I wasn't particularly familiar) as Officer Lockhart, who becomes obsessed with trying to figure out these murders.I have to confess that as the first murders were being investigated (involving puncture wounds on the necks of the victims) I began to think that this was going to unexpectedly turn out to be a vampire movie, but the real ""twist"" in the movie turns out to be time travel - so it does eventually have something of a sci-fi (rather than horror) twist to it. The murderer is travelling backward through time killing people in order to prevent a future tragedy. So it's dealing with the old ethical dilemma of ""If you could go back in time would you kill Hitler as a baby in his crib? Or his parents before he was born? Or his grandparents before they were born?"" There are other twists that eventually get revealed, but I'll leave them for those who choose to view the movie to discover.The time travel element was a successful twist. It made the story more intriguing than it otherwise might have been. Having said that, I thought it was a middling sort of movie. Some are complaining about the supposed political agenda behind it. I just thought the story was insufficient to carry the movie and by about the halfway point I was losing interest in what was happening on the screen. I give this some credit for turning out to be not at all what I was expecting it to be, but that alone isn't enough to really save it. (5/10)",In the Shadow of the Moon
11,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,Ambitious but misfiring sci-fi drama,4,30 December 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn 1988, Detective Locke (Boyd Holbrook) walks the beat, with a heavily pregnant wife at home. But he is about to plunged into something beyond his wildest comprehension, when he and his partner Maddox (Bokeem Woodbine) are called to the scene of several grisly deaths, where the victims have brutally died in seemingly unfathomable circumstances. Locke closes in on the suspect, Rya (Cleopatra Coleman) who appears to meet her death on a railway line. But nine years later, a series of copycat murders crop up, and Rya once again seems to be behind them, driving Locke in a desperation to get to a truth that will shake him to the very core.We're presently living in the most politically and socially tumultuous of times in quite a while, where the extremes of both sides of the divide are at each other's throats in a way that many of us will not have experienced in our lifetimes. There is a real fear from many of what the future holds, and how everything panning out now will come to bear on it. And so In the Shadow of the Moon, a Netflix production directed by Jim Mickle, is certainly quite timely and relevant. Unfortunately, while intriguing and fairly original, it's all too far fetched and increasingly nonsensical to work.Once the original concept of the story has played out, it manifests into a tale of one man and his obsession to get to the bottom of a case over a number of years and progressions in his life, but this was done to better effect in David Fincher's 2007 film Zodiac, about a real life murderer. When the end revelation does come by, it presents a moral quandary about the killer's motivations that has divided opinion among reviewers, and there is a clever and genuinely surprising twist at the end of it, but it's a real struggle to get there.Ultimately, this is a uniquely beautiful film, that ultimately gets weighed down by it's own disconnect from reality. **",In the Shadow of the Moon
12,MOscarbradley,Something of a guilty pleasure.,6,1 March 2020,"Jim Mickle's ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" is a cross between a sci-fi film and a serial killer thriller and if the sci-fi elements far outweigh the serial killer parts it hardly matters because this enjoyable, reasonably intelligent and rather daft movie never stops to draw breath and gives its leading actor, Boyd Holbrook, a part he can finally get his teeth into. He's a cop investigating a series of murders in Philadelphia in 1988 that end with the apparent death of the killer. Skip forward nine years and the exact same kind of killings start all over again.Of course, with this kind of movie you have to suspend disbelief from the start and if you are prepared to give yourself over to it, it's actually a lot of fun. In a good supporting cast Michael C. Hall is a stand out as a senior detective who seems slower on the uptake than he ought to be. Excellent cinematography, too, from David Lanzenberg and a good score from Jeff Grace make this something of a guilty pleasure.",In the Shadow of the Moon
13,Cineanalyst,To Terminate an Idea,4,11 October 2019,"""In the Shadow of the Moon"" begins as an intriguing mystery, full of action and promising the sci-fi thrills of time travel, but the more it unfolds, as everything is painfully and simplistically spelled out for the spectator, it becomes clear that the central conceit of the picture is utterly trite. Ironically, the story is about traveling to the origin of an idea to prevent it from ever being, but the space-time-continuum-splicing plot kills the fun of trying to figure out the idea of the movie--it does so by expressing that idea. By following the detective protagonist, we share in chasing after the idea, but by chasing it we come to realize we shouldn't have bothered chasing it in the first place. I would prefer to recommend viewing this to the end of the 1988 segment, or perhaps the beginning of the 1997 part, and have one try to fill in the blanks themselves, rather than to suggest watching the entire movie.This is the second time-travel picture I've seen recently released and streamed by Netflix. The other, ""See You Yesterday"" (2019), takes the Back to the Future series as its basis. ""In the Shadow of the Moon,"" however, is in the tradition of The Terminator franchise. Except, here, the human time traveler is in the position originally occupied by the machines--trying to kill the man responsible for a movement that would prove their demise. Originally, before the sequels and franchising took over--and will continue with another soon-to-be-released installment, ""The Terminator"" (1984) worked because it wasn't spoiled by the future being unfolded for us. The more the sequels have entered the territory of the idea(s) behind the rise of the machines and past the judgement day, the less interesting the endeavor has become. So, too, here, as our human time traveler sets out to, basically, abort racist John Connor.And, to think of all the potential this one had to begin with. Before she, as the time traveler says, ""volunteered to untell the story,"" my mind was filling in possible avenues. The puncture marks could've had vampiric allusions with all of its sexual and xenophobic implications, as reinforced by the Moon, with its connection to werewolves (that is, originally, with ""The Wolf Man"" (1941), the werewolf was a deviation from the ""Dracula"" formula, much as with this movie being that of ""The Terminator""). There was the film noir implications of a detective in a timeline that he's unable to alter--always a victim of fate, while he chases after a time traveler moving in the opposite direction altering fate. The ideas could've become more complicated the more they unfolded. But, this ends up going another way.It goes the way of presidential biography, the books of which we're repeatedly shown during the murders. They're early presidents, too--the ones leading up to and through the Civil War. And most of the picture takes place in Philadelphia, the birthplace of the United States. She travels back in time to prevent another Civil War; another characters ponders what it would take to have prevented the first one. Race is central to both, and our time traveler is biracial. Racially-charged street marches spring up in 1997 as a consequence of events in 1988. It may not be a coincidence, either, that the current POTUS has, let's say, a controversial record on issues of diversity and that the movie's future takes place in 2024. Currently, the US is entering another quadrennial presidential election season, and it won't do so again until the run-up to 2024. This isn't so much an idea that should be buried, although the filmmakers would've done a favor had they done so, but it's inept. The Terminator movies look to the future of our reliance upon machines and technology, but this one is fretting over white supremacists. At least, ""See You Yesterday"" dealt with race in a realistic and contemporary way (although, arguably, too much so), as well as explicitly paying homage to the ""Back to the Future"" films by casting Michael J. Fox. Here, instead, we get the ridiculous notion that killing a few bigots will prevent global, or at least national, catastrophe. The idea is not that powerful. A deeper narrative is untold.",In the Shadow of the Moon

15,cruise01,Crime thriller with a twist.,7,28 September 2019,"In the Shadow of the Moon (3.5 out of 5 stars).In the Shadow of the Moon is a pretty decent crime thriller film with a bit hint of sci fi concept and some decent action thrills. The plot starts out like a simple crime thriller. Police officer Locke (Boyd Holbrook) and his partner are investigating three murders at the same time and done by the same criminal Rya (Cleopatra Coleman). She escapes and confronts Locke at the train station that they ll meet again. Several years later, a few more murders happen the same away which drives Locke to trying to catch her. And years later on the same day, she is back and he is trying to figure out her motives.The concept is a like low budget Terminator movie with a human time travelling and being an assassin to take out targets. The one question is why? The answer may not be as surprising or mind bending for a sci fi story. It does throw one character Locke into an obsession for years until he has wasted his life away when he missed out on his daughters childhood and being there for her.Boyd Holbrook performance is decent. Cleopatra Coleman was also okay playing a mysterious assassin. The film does have a twist in the end which ties the characters story arc.The film does have some entertaining thrilling action. Overall, In the Shadow of the Moon is a pretty fair film with some decent action and performance.",In the Shadow of the Moon
16,eddie_baggins,Would've worked better as a mini-series,6,13 November 2019,"In the space of a decade, indie director Jim Mickle has shown himself to be a unique filmmaking voice with an increasingly diverse range of films to back up his reputation.2010 and 2013 horror films Stakeland and We Are Who We Are were well received genre entries, 2014's Cold of July surprised many with its unique take on the thriller genre, while the now cancelled but well-liked TV series Hap and Leonard showed a more playful side to the director, who has now teamed up with Netflix to deliver sci-fi mind-bender In the Shadow of the Moon, to ensure Mickle is continuing to push himself into new experiences that you sense will one day deliver a downright classic.Flirting the line between captivating and original and disappointingly familiar, Shadow sees Mickle tackle his most ambitious narrative yet as we follow Boyd Holbrook's Philadelphia police officer Thomas Lockart from the 80's, deep into the early 2000's as he strives to uncover the mysterious identity of a masked killer whose bizarre yet plotted killings continue to haunt him across multiple time periods.Saying too much more about where Lockhart's journey takes him would be a disservice to Mickle's film that is at its best when you're unsure of exactly what lays waiting around the next corner but it's unfortunate that Lockhart's journey becomes an increasingly familiar one, as the initially mind-melting set-up plays out in a more predictable and unsurprising manner with not much room for growth across a plot that arguably deserved more fleshing out and screen time to maximize the potential at its core.In a day and age where viewers and particularly those avid Netflix subscribers are treated to an abundance of highly proficient and binge-worthy content from TV series to mini-series, Shadow feels as though it would've been perfectly suited to a limited run 6 - 8 episode season to more comprehensively explore the going's on that Lockhart's quest takes him on.At around the half-way mark of the film it's hard to escape the feeling that more time spent grasping the discoveries of Lockhart's investigation and the emotional toll it takes on him would've been captivating stuff and after a career that has so far been largely relegated to solid supporting turns in the likes of Run All Night, A Walk Among the Tombstones and a forgettable lead role in last years The Predator, Holbrook's impressive turn here could've carried Shadow along nicely as its fun but rushed 2nd act plays out neatly enough without ever fully transforming the film into the genuinely must-see experience it may have been.Final Say -Another solid entry into the Jim Mickle filmography, In the Shadow of the Moon is an ambitious sci-fi thriller that shows glimmers of brilliance around more half-explored and so-so storytelling, to become a film worth seeking out without ever being a film you'd call a must-watch.3 bus drivers out of 5",In the Shadow of the Moon

20,jtindahouse,Like Benjamin Button,7,29 September 2019,"Most movies start out slowly and then build and build until exploding at the end. 'In the Shadow of the Moon' is the opposite. It starts out with a hiss and a roar and then slows down steadily through until the end. For the first 45 minutes to an hour I was absolutely hooked and on the edge of my seat. Then the movie hit a grinding wall and never really recovered. It went into explanation mode and that will be the death of a film's pace more often than not. Still, I had quite a good time with this film.I'm not sure if it's a spoiler or not to say the film deals in time travel. The film reveals it reasonably early, but there is a 20-30 minute gap at the beginning of the movie where you don't know that's the case. Time travel in movies can be a very messy thing. You always get your audience asking ""but what if..."". It's impossible not to. There are so many connotations. I'm not sure the logic in this film was entirely flawless, but it was logical enough that it will leave most audience members satisfied. Also there's a twist at the end that throws some spanners into the works. It's a half-decent twist, but not one that is going to leave any jaws on the floor.This is a really intriguing concept for a movie. It's been done before, but not exactly like this. I love all the thinking it leaves its audience to do after the credits roll. Some strong acting also aides this movie in being extremely watchable, particularly in the first half. I had a really good time with 'In the Shadow of the Moon' and I think most viewers will find at least some aspect of it that they will enjoy too.",In the Shadow of the Moon

It offers up an intriguing story about time as a circular as opposed to linear proposition. It asks a number of questions not just about time but what value it has to us, as people. It even offered up an ending that managed to surprise me.The acting is decent too, with a great cast who really bring the story to life.Where it falls down somewhat is in some of the more predictable aspects of the story.An obsessed absent father seeking a form of redemption, A descent into poverty and what appears, on the surface, to be a form of madness.I felt this film could have managed these elements differently and still offered the emotional punchline it delivers in the end.Still, on balance,there is more to like here than not.

26,peterp-450-298716,I really like movies about time-traveling.,6,10 October 2019,"If you kill me now...
the world as you know it will end
in a very short time.Yeah. Once again a movie about time traveling. Always interesting to see how they incorporated the paradox of time travel. And there's always going to be someone who claims something isn't right. Not that I really care about that because I still don't know anyone who has actually traveled through time to provide proof whether changes in the past may or may not affect the future. Perhaps that would provide proof of whether the grandfather paradox is plausible or not. So, for me, it's still pure Sci-Fi. And that results in enjoyable films such as ""About Time"", ""I'll follow you down"" or ""Predestination"". And this Netflix Original certainly wasn't that bad either.This film differs enormously from one like ""Predestination"". And this in terms of simplicity. It's not all that complicated. Don't expect such an immense ""mindfuck"" as in the latter. You don't need an immense manual or walk-through here. And furthermore, it's a pleasant mixture of detective-movie and Sci-Fi. The tracing of a serial killer (active in Philadelphia) by the ambitious police officer Locke (Boyd Holbrook) is the common thread throughout the film. The apparently randomly selected innocent victims, die a terrible death in which decomposing brains are the cause of the sudden death. Locke discovers that all the victims have scars in the neck area. Soon it's said that an isotope is the cause of them ending up dead in a rapidly spreading blood pool. And when a fourth victim manages to give an accurate description of the person, a massive search is being conducted. Locke ends up face to face with a young, colored teenager (with a thorough knowledge of combat techniques) in a blue jogging suit (Cleopatra Coleman). The biggest shock for Locke is that she knows a lot of facts about Locke. Facts she couldn't have known. And before you know it, it's 9 years later ...The film is divided into time periods of 9 years. Starting in the year 1988. The year that the first murders happen. It's actually the most action-rich part. And also the most realistic. The way in which a cook, concert pianist and female bus driver meet their end, has been portrayed enormously realistic. Don't expect an ordinary cause of death. It's pretty bloody. And in the case of the bus driver, quite spectacular. But when the phenomenon of the returning teenager reveals itself and you finally begin to understand what's going on, realism slowly but surely fades away and gives way to pure fiction. And gradually you realize that this isn't a typical detective film, with inspectors (like in ""Se7en"") chasing a crazy serial killer. No way. It gradually transforms into a thoughtful sci-fi and then ends in a corny drama about family issues.To be honest, I thought the acting performance of Boyd Holbrook as the wayward Locke wasn't bad at all. Perseverance and drivenness were exceptionally well portrayed. Because of his obsession to solve the mystery, he loses control of reality. It destroys his family relationships and interferes with his work. Gradually Locke turns into an unkempt tramp, without work and living in his car. Therefore, let me praise the make-up department of this production. And although Holbrook's acting was outstanding, you can't say he out-sings the rest of the cast. They weren't bad, but you can't speak of spectacular interpretations either. Only the action-rich fight scenes with Cleopatra Coleman as an unleashed fury pleased me as well.No, ""In the shadow of the Moon"" certainly wasn't a disastrous film. Although the story was essentially not too original. And you get that feeling that you've seen it all before. Probably because of that, the denouement wasn't really surprising. Perhaps the opening scene was too revealing as well. The question of whether you can avoid disaster by drastically changing something in the past is and remains fascinating. I bet that the event they tried to undo, will be the subject of discussion once again. Just look at the politically charged opinions on other websites. Even the word ""propaganda"" is used all too often. The patronizing tone and the explanatory nature of the film was no obstacle for me to enjoy this film. Don't expect a groundbreaking movie. But it surely was entertaining enough. So, it's definitely well worth a watch, this Netflix Original.You can watch ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" on Netflix now!More reviews here: movie-freak.be",In the Shadow of the Moon
27,AnnaPagrati,So good!,10,17 September 2021,This movie is honestly gold! Has you wrapped up in the plot until the last minute!,In the Shadow of the Moon
28,Easygoer10,Well Done Film,8,11 October 2019,I liked this film. Especially the little clues along the way. My favorite (clue) is when you see the American flag the woman who gave him the mailing list was given when her man was killed. It only has a few stars on it. That is when I knew the ending would twist so well. A very good time travel film. Boyd Holbrook is getting much better.,In the Shadow of the Moon
29,elliotjeory,Interesting sci-fi concept,7,29 September 2019,"This was an interesting sci-fi film that started with promise but unfortunately kind of had a limp third act which was a little disappointing. I think making him an ex-cop and crazy loser was a mistake. That narrative didn't work.
Otherwise it's a good film, an intriguing story with some good ideas and good supporting acting. Boyd is a great actor and I can see why he went for this film it just needed tweaking to make it a lot better.",In the Shadow of the Moon

31,Troy_Campbell,Good for a lazy Sunday night at home.,6,27 September 2019,"Time travel and serial killers have been extremely popular territory to explore in film for a long time, so it follows that a thriller about a time-travelling serial-killer should hit the jackpot if done right. The Netflix original gets part way there. Written and directed by Jim Mickle - a filmmaker who has almost exclusively made grungy content not designed for comfortable viewing (Cold in July, We Are What We Eat) - there's a rough-around-the-edges tone and aesthetic that places this in the grimy corner of the sci-fi genre. Structured in five parts, starting in 1988 and jumping nine years forward for each segment, the plot is relatively simple for a time-travel yarn; the weaved-in themes of regret, fate, pride and grief more the crux of what Mickle is trying to get across. Unfortunately, there are a few flaws which make this movie hard to really like: the unnecessary injection of plodding action sequences, the rather predictable and overly neat ending, the CGI eyesores, and Bookem Woodbine's terrible supporting turn. But with a solid lead performance by Boyd Holbrook, a thematically meaty plot and some judiciously placed moments of horrific violence, In the Shadow of the Moon grips enough to make it recommendable for a lazy Sunday night at home.",In the Shadow of the Moon
32,vithiet,"Great sci-fi, more of a 7/10 but extra star for reasons that make this my first ever spoiler-tagged review",8,8 August 2020,"The concept is great, acting and directing was fantastic for that type of movie and I thought this was an unexpected little gem as I knew very little going in.
Are there some plot holes? Yes, but that's inherent to almost every time travel movie, you need a moderate amount of suspension of disbelief.Now on to the politicized aspect of the movie and why this has the spoiler tag. You can't talk about it without spoiling the fact that the premise is based around the revelation that some bad people will do bad things and someone is sent back in time to correct this. And that is why I'm giving an extra star, to balance out the low reviews knocking down the movie because they feel attacked. And that's the irony... the movie just depicts bad people as promoting hate speech, inciting social division and promoting violent, civil unrest. But outraged reviewers are quick to point this as an attack against the ""right wing"". The movie never said anything about any political affiliation;, history has proven time and again that hate and fascism is just the wrong way to go for humanity so if that's what you're leaning towards, don't be surprised if there is a lot of messaging around that's against it/you. But close mindedness comes with the territory and you probably would be deaf to anything I or anyone else has to say. This is more for people who are more open minded and wonder if they should watch the movie. Please do; could it have explored the whole moral dilemma of ""is it ok to go back in time to kill Hitler's parents""? Maybe. But it really wasn't the point of that movie.",In the Shadow of the Moon

But the environment, story, talk, actors are all amateur and boring. Meaning there is no quality in expressions, reactions, events, details that would make them appear more realistic and interesting. Not convincing, not adventurous enough, and as most bad movies lasts too long.

34,MadamWarden,"Confusing, illogical but fun",5,4 October 2019,"As always with time travel movies, even those I saw over the next few years, getting the logic right and consistent i.e. without paradoxes, is tough. This one is an example of one that doesn't quite get it right when you think it through.Ok, now that we have ascertained that the logic is flawed, the movie is largely solid. Solid acting, fun action, solid character development and ask told a bit of fun.I have certainly seen a lot worse in mainstream cinema releases next year. Oh, ok, this year.

35,PsychoBeard666,Starts off as a 10 then loses points towards the end,7,21 January 2020,"What a brilliant start to a film. Unexplained vampiric deaths brilliantly and mysteriously executed.

The ending felt very rushed.",In the Shadow of the Moon
36,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Good time travel scifi/thriller,8,31 January 2021,"I went into it without watching the trailer so I had no perceived ideas of what the film was about. For time-travel thrillers, I thought it one was unique and different. Because of that, it kept my interest. The movie keeps you in the dark for 2/3 thirds of the run time, enough time for me to activately engage the film by coming up with possible theories to the reason for the deaths. In my head I had ideas from a viral outbreak like Ebola, vampires and extra-terrestrial aliens. Until the girl showed up and then it was the Ah ha! moment.But it was strange so many people from different walks a life continue life as normal after being pierced on the back of the neck. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't show normal people being attacked by the girl.The film has plenty of dramatic car chase scenes and marital arts fighting action that I enjoyed. But the identity of the girl is somewhat revealed after the first chance encounter between her and the police detective in the train station. I would have appreciated a more subtle hint. But they did toss in a puzzle. The girl is black and the detective's daughter is white. I bet that was done deliberately to keep the audience guessing. Had the girl been white, I would have lost interest right away because I would have suspected who she was exactly. Nice touch!I really did enjoy the film because the story takes a different approach to time-travel thrillers even if the idea isn't new. But the way they approached it kept me interested in the film and that's a plus. I also appreciated the film has no non-sensical techno babble found in lesser sci-fi films. I just hate it when screenwriters give actors meaningless dialog filled with technobabble. This film keeps the dialog real and down to earth. It has that police detective thriller/crime drama feel to it. No technobabble like ""I'm detecting a slight field variance in the tantulum gluon teleporter. They need to uncrumple the caesium crystal core."" crap.This one is a must see for Netflix subscribers who like gritty crime dramas and sci-fi films.",In the Shadow of the Moon
37,silvermistvio,Mystery and interesting. Not bad!,6,2 October 2019,"In the Shadow of the Moon is somehow an interesting film. It's about time travel and changing the past thing. I love Sci-Fi films concerning with time travel. Those films give the audience a fresh view and their imagination. That's why I love those kinds of films.I must admit that this film is kind of a good one. It has interesting things. They made it very mysterious even it was just a simple time travel. That being said, the film is somehow boring. Maybe they chose to make this a drama. So, it becomes a little bit boring. If they could do it less boring, well, I think I'd be more into this film.How much boring? Well, I watched this film last night before I ate dinner. After some time, I had to stop for a while to eat dinner. After that I watched for some minutes. But at that time, I was kind of feeling sleepy, so, I stopped watching and went to bed. This morning, I continued to watch. Finally, I finished watching. During those times, I wasn't so eager to watch. If it wasn't that much boring, I always feel so eager to continue to watch. But this one, I was kind of not in hurry to finish. So, yeah, it's a bit boring.There are two things that I don't understand. One is how she died. In the later scene, Tom said he killed her the first time he met her. And then there's some proof that Tom didn't fire his gun. In fact, there was no one fired the gun. But she died with the bullet in her left hand and hit by the train. If she died because she got hit by the train, I understand that. But the bullet? When did Tom put a bullet in her hand? There's no such scene in the film.Two is that the reason why she killed all those people. I know that she killed them because she wanted to stop a big bad thing that will happen in her time. And they explained that those people will somehow start that bad thing, so, in order to not to let that thing happen, she had to kill all those people. But they didn't explain how those people started that bad thing. I want to see about that.The film is good, but the ending isn't. The ending is so much rush. It's like they don't have any more budget and make the film end in a hurry or immediately. This is also what I don't like of this film. If they didn't do like that, the film would be better.All in all, the film is good indeed. If they didn't do what they shouldn't do, this film will go under my favourite films of all time list. Right now, I can only say it's just a fine film.Edited on 7th October 2019: After second time of carefully watch, I finally found out how she got a bullet in her hand. It wasn't that much clear, so, I missed it. If they have done more clearly, it'd be better.",In the Shadow of the Moon
38,pietclausen,Quite OK Movie,7,2 October 2019,"By following the movie properly and understanding the science, there is nothing wrong with this story and actually quite likable. The time-line is fine and the end is revealing the truth.Another nice flick from Netflix!",In the Shadow of the Moon
39,kuarinofu,The rules and mechanics of your story are important,7,20 October 2019,"I saw lots of political stuff in the reviews of this film, but since I'm not from the US I took it all much easier.The film was very engaging (and good-looking) up until 2006. Then it got somewhat messy and the pacing slowed down a lot.Approaching the end I was anticipating an interesting and smart conclusion while becoming more and more suspicious about how exactly the whole technical side of the film should work.And as it turns out - it doesn't. The movie's mechanics make the ending we got impossible and also incomplete. The central choice our protagonist has to make was not shown in the film and I'm not even sure if there is one (once again due to the film breaking its own rules).Other than that, I enjoyed most of the film and I can recommend it.

43,johannes2000-1,"Interesting premise, but it couldn't convince me.",4,4 October 2019,"The premise of this movie is interesting enough. First, that from the future people can come back to change the course of the world and prevent bad things (wars, destruction) to happen; second, that killing innocent people is allowed when you can presume that this is for the greater good.I'm sorry, but I wasn't convinced with either. As to the time-travel thing: who in the future decides what things need to be changed? And if so, wouldn't we already live in a wonderful carefree pristine world because every bad thing would by now have been erased by future time-travelling agents? And as to killing for the greater good, here they don't mean something straightforward like shooting Hitler or (like in Stephen Kings 11/22/63) killing Lee Oswald, but killing all those who are at the very basis of the development of ideas that can eventually harm the world. It's not only a moral question that gets way to little attention here (main character Lockhart fights it for many years but in the end is persuaded to the righteousness of it within two minutes!), but in my humble opinion the writers overlooked the ultimate consequence of their ideas, because by going back further and further to the roots of everything you would virtually have to start by killing Adam and Eve!Anyway, as a scifi action-thriller it had some entertainment value, but only in the first say half hour. The acting of Boyd Holbrook was fine enough, although I thought his extreme vagabond appearance and attitude in the last part of the movie was a bit over the top. The killings were excitingly horrendous but how this should fit into the concept of the story is beyond me: an agent from the future could choose a more discreet and kind way of killing than painfully draining people's brains through their eyes, ears and noses and by this draw the attention of the authorities.All in all not convincing enough, I rank it 4 out of 10.",In the Shadow of the Moon

It runs too long too, at least 30 min. could be cut off.

49,TwistedContent,Engaging & Imaginative Police Thriller with a Twist too Slow & too Expected,7,27 September 2019,"The talanted horror/thriller director Jim Mickle (Cold in July; Stake Land) teams up with the rising star Boyd Holbrook & brings to Netflix his newest piece - the exciting and entertaining mystery detective/killer flick ""In the Shadow of the Moon"".""In the Shadow of the Moon"" starts like any other police thriller, introducing us to a duo of likeable cops, a damp city full of crime & a mystery in the making. Through equal amounts of engaging drama, energetic action and time skipping we steadily move forward to the solution of the mystery, accompanied by the obsessive detective Lockhart who's got some heavy burdens on his shoulders. Boyd Holbrook, whom I first saw on ""Narcos"" (as I'm sure many people did as well) gives a great lead performance as detective Lockhart & the supporting cast helps him out well, especially Bokeem Woodbine & Cleopatra Coleman. The revelation of the sci-fi twist & the point of the mystery comes a tad bit too slowly & doesn't quite have the impact one would wish for, but, nevertheless, while ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" left me wanting more, at the same time the ending felt right. The themes of horrors and wonders of humanity & family values are served well. We cannot forget that the movie also looks gorgeous, has a decent original score, well made action sequences & even features a few bloody scenes for the horror fans. In summary, ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" kinda looks like, feels like and plays out like a big-screen movie.I think this movie could've been a little less convoluted, with a different, less straight forward mystery building structure, but the result is still engaging, handsome and thoughtful thriller piece.

This one is about a half-black girl whose momma had a rough life that left her with huge daddy issues. Her mom dies in child birth and dad starts a lifetime of obsessive manhunt for the person he killed but keeps coming back.

54,ritera1,"Although long, I liked it quite a bit...then...",8,6 October 2019,"...the questions started.A lot of interesting element (like time-travel Predestination had) and a very good director. But the script had a series of plot holes that made themselves evident as I thought about it afterwards.The element that she was going back and landing on later dates before reaching the earlier ones was very interesting. Thought her death and resurrection would be cheesy, but it wasn't.The first segment in the '80s was the most exciting and interesting. The way the victims were killed was grotesque but effective. The two cops seemingly doing whatever they wanted for several hours was way too convenient but unfortunately necessary for the plot. And the examination of the dead bodies smacked of X-Files.The bus crash was forced (but looked good) as none of the passengers ran to the front to stop it and had enough time to do so. Confusing at the end of the '80s segment where he pocketed the strange weapon, said he didn't do anything to her---then suddenly was in the evidence bag in the '90s segment.Boyd Holbrook did a good job in the '80s segment but felt like they just dumped make-up on him for the subsequent ones. Was not feeling that he aged.I can understand the need for brevity in a film, but finding more evidence on the 9th anniversaries was too convenient. I know they established having the history books in the first segment but it was a strange device later. Why would the racist need to hide the newsletters in a book? There was no qualifying that point.Now making the future bad guy a rabid right-winger was topical and current, to say the least. I guess I went along with the ""civil war"" aspect to be agreeable, but really thought it was a paranoid stretch.Rya seemed to have and then not have certain vague talents, too. Cleopatra Colemen sold her well and the fights were exciting. Her leap from the 2nd story that seemed too easy. Nevermind when she too-easily pushed our hero out of the plane and then seemingly crashed in the mountain. Did she just leap out to the ocean, too, being it was adjacent to her time travel cave?Found a problem in our hero presenting his evidence to the brother-in-law. Yes, the plot needed the brother-in-law to not believe him. But despite our hero's ratty appearance, had some pretty compelling evidence that even the biggest skeptic would examine.In the end, I was vague on the weapon she used to kill. Why? I was clear that someone in the future could then kill the victim. But why the delay? Why not a more conventional way to kill? Yes, I know that it was interesting as the plot went on but, in the end, really didn't make analytical sense.I've seen a few comments here and there about this being ""anti-white,"" which are funny because of the plot.

58,tfminfl,Serial Killer Tale,7,2 November 2019,"361. In the Shadow of the Moon. Pretty sweet Netflix movie! I read the description 'life long obsession' and 'serial killer' and I was ready to go! Starts out with young police officer Locke, who really, really wants to be a detective, and happens to get involved with a string of connected murders, and actually has an early confrontation with the killer. Without giving to much away, after their confrontation, lets just say, it will be extremely unlikely that the killer will strike again. Afterwards Locke does indeed get his wish of becoming a homicide detective. About a decade or so later, another string of murders occur, same M.O. as the first... Of course Locke is completely baffled, and yep, he becomes quite obsessed, with this super bizarre turn of events. And when it happens another decade later... something going on here!! The description of the movie left out a huge element of the movie, I of course did not watch the trailer, because trailers suck. They usually give you the whole movie if you pay enough attention. But anyways, yea I really liked it, mostly because it was a surprise. No one is going to win an oscar for acting in this one.

59,Lewis_Heather787,"Solid, all round good thriller with an interesting twist!",7,28 September 2019,"The trailer for this film got me straight on board, so was pretty interested to see how this was gonna play out............you know what, it was not half bad although it does have its problems, it was an entertaining watch.Two main positives to the film, firstly Boyd Holbrook.........is simply fantastic in the film. Following the character over many decades, showing real growth and transformation for better or worse. The events that have happened and are happening in his life are truly brutal, whilst having a surprising twist right at the end. His story starts as a young cop trying to work his way up the ladder when a big case falls into his lap......well he makes it fall into his lap. We then follow the character at certain points in time starting in 1998 then 1997, 2006 and 2015. Each iteration of the character has a slight difference to him, Holbrook really nails the ageing of the character and what that would do to him mentally and physically considering what he has gone through. Definitely his most accomplished role to date up there with ""Logan"" and even though the film wasn't great I still think he was good in ""The Predator"". A sort of breakout role that hopefully should push his career into bigger and better things, because this film to me shows that he has range as an actor. Brilliant!The other main positive is two in one really....the story/directing. The use of telling a story by jumping in time can either work with the film or it can hinder it terribly. I am very pleased to say that in this film it worked perfectly. At every time there was a time shift it felt as if the previous time period had closed on a real chapter....as in a chapter of a book. The mystery of the murders happening every 9 years was fascinating to see it unfold.....the deaths were horrific and brilliantly portrayed on screen. The film definitely keeps you guessing as to what happens at the end....and my word the twist was one I personally didn't see coming and thought worked really well, gave the film such emotional weight and punch that it needed. When we find out its his grand-daughter the whole time that he was chasing and that he had killed earlier in 1988......is gut wrenching. Beautiful done. However as well as being a personally story for Holbrook's character it is a story about eradicating hate from the world before a human disaster happens in the future. It pulls on themes that are around in our lives today to give it context and to make a connection to us the audience.....Handles it very well and doesn't over do it. Combine all that with brilliant directing from start to finish, each decade portrayed really well. Most importantly no continuity errors which can easily creep up with time jumps. The film is beautifully shot from start to finish.The main negatives I have are to do with the pacing of the film and a bit of a lull in the middle of the film. The pacing of the film is a little off...I'd say that the first 50 minutes are fine but just after that it goes a little all over the place....especially considering the short-ish runtime. At about the mid way point of the film......it does start to drift off a little bit and start to get a bit stale. Not sure why, it just doesn't have the same pace or enthusiasm as the beginning or end portion of the film.Overall I thought it was good 70% out of 100, I have to say that Netflix is getting better and better with the product they are putting out. The quality of the films they are producing keeps increasing and this is just an example of that. Good directing, story, one fantastic performance with an interesting twist.........what more could you want from a sci-fi thriller?????",In the Shadow of the Moon

It is a very well directed sci-fi thriller with a very ingenious twist, though it falls prey to the usual chicken and egg problem that time travel poses to the less bright minds.
Anyway, it has a decent cast and a nice all-round production and it makes for a very entertaining watch. Is this cult-movie material? No. Would I watch it again? Nope. Do I regret watching it? Nah.

Hall, so terrific in two acclaimed TV series, has none at all here and his performance is simply poor. The two actresses playing his daughter at different ages aren't remotely similar. Poor casting.

64,ivko,an interesting mind bender,6,30 September 2019,"If you had a time machine, would you go back and kill baby Hitler? This ethical dilemma, which has been around since practically right after WWII, has been argued for decades. The core idea it explores is whether people who are destined to do horrible things are moral aberrations in an otherwise functional society who, like a wedge on the railroad tracks, twist the course of events off track with calamitous results or, alternatively, if people are the product of the times in which they live, which argues that killing baby Hitler would be a meaningless gesture, as someone else would simply fill the vacancy his non-existence left.This conundrum is related to the events of the film, as witnessed through the eyes of a man exposed to a mystery that only becomes clear over the course of his life. It starts in the late 80's when a string of random murders rocks Philadelphia. The main character, an ambitious young police officer named Locke, is one of the first to respond to a number of strange homicides perpetrated by a young black woman whom he accidentally kills while attempting to apprehend her. Before her death, she makes a number of comments that indicate knowledge of events she shouldn't have access to, leaving unanswered questions in his mind.Despite the aura of mystery, life moves on for Locke until nine years later when the woman suddenly reappears, once again killing seemingly random people before disappearing yet again. Locke begins to suspect the mystery can only be explained with supernatural elements and becomes obsessed with solving it, despite the heavy toll on his personal life it takes.The story jumps forward every nine years to show a single day in Locke's life. By the end of the third jump a little past the half way point the movie reveals the basic outline of what is driving the mysterious events, though it reserves a few of the surprises more personal to Locke for the final act. This explanation also explains a brief ominous scene at the very beginning of the movie.After a few more time jumps that fill in the last pieces and add an action scene or two, the movie brings things to a mostly satisfying conclusion that wraps up the mystery and personal issues of Locke's life. The ending is a tad anti-climactic since there is no ""bad"" guy and the big surprise is just that a relationship mentioned earlier in the movie is mixed race which, if they intended that to be shocking, would have required the movie to be made four or five decades ago.The movie does it's best to sell an ending that's billed as positive, although I saw echoes of a much darker implication, unintentional and all the more scary for it. The way the movies sells its ending (spoiler warning!), people from the future using time travel to kill white supremacists in the past whose ideas ultimately spark a new civil war, is by having a character ask Locke ""what if you could stop the civil war?"" All those untold thousands of deaths, all that suffering, all that division, just snuffed out by identifying and targeting a few individuals that were the key voices behind the secessionist movement. One hundred deaths for 600,000. Provided you're not overly concerned about that pesky ""freedom of speech"" stuff it's a bargain, right?Except when you stop to consider where we were as a nation before the civil war. Much as it seems fait accompli now, the prevailing attitude in the union wasn't actually homogeneously anti-slavery. Many deplored it, certainly, but many held beliefs somewhere in between and would have been fine with it's continuation so long as they didn't have to see it or enforce the practice within the borders of their state. The confederacy and the civil war crystallized and hardened beliefs; it forced people who might have otherwise preferred not to pick a side.I can't say for certain that without the civil war, civil rights would have been set back by decades or more, but I think there is at least an argument to be made that it might have. No one likes suffering and destruction, but a thing cheaply won does not have the same value as that which has been paid for with, to paraphrase Lincoln, ""the solemn pride...to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.""So I found the end a little chilling, certainly not for the stated goals that motivated the characters, but for the way it championed the use of a godlike power without a true understanding of the potential cost of that power, and for the idea that it's presented as a good thing that a small group of individuals, however well meaning, wielded that power over the entirety of mankind as judge, jury, and executioners unbeknownst to those whose lives they impacted.Then again, maybe I'm just thinking too much about a movie that's just a fun little bit of what-if science fiction.",In the Shadow of the Moon

My own political views are what i see as sane.. I hold views of politics and society that fit all over the spectrum of opinion and morals regarding left and right. If you buy into liberal v. conservative. You got to slap yourself in the face and get out of that bubble of delusional partisan thinking.. It's not logical and from what I gather by the reviews on this film. Is making a bunch of people completely cynical and dim witted to any idea, concept, entertainment or anything they dont agree with is worth slandering and trying to ruin into the dirt.Watch this film for yourself. Make up your own mind.
I found the political side of this film to be nothing but cog in the machine of the more interesting story. Which is about our central character in the film and his journey into the upside reality he finds himself in, his struggle and journey in figuring out what is going on is what made me entertained through the film. The direction and cinematography is very standard. Nothing special. But not bad. Some of the dialogue was pretty bad in some scenes but it doesnt ruin the film.I guess the concept of American militia terrorism offends people and cant be used in movies anymore, because I guess a lot of conservatives now feel the need to stick up for even the most insane people on their side. And the left feel the need to try and 'cancel' anything they think might even make you think about the definition of the term conservative.
It's all nonsense.

Oh, it's alright, you'll get a half-decent evening watching it on Netflix, but it's frustrating to see a film like this just bottom out and fail. Sets up an interesting premise and then blows all it's potential. Don't get me wrong, it never manages to drag itself out of solid c-grade territory, due to a muddled and unpolished script, but the ending it so tediously weak that it makes the whole thing seem even worse.It starts like it's potentially a horror film - mysterious gruesome deaths and whatnot, and some really bad acting from Michael C Hall. It's kind of bad acting all round, to be honest though. Then it starts to veer into sci-fi territory. Films like this that have a gimmick going on often tend to go one of two ways - it either is fantastic (like, say, Minority Report or Predestination) or really weak (like, well, this film).Films like Minority Report take a central idea, and then build a great story around it. Predestination is all about the characters and the central idea almost takes a back seat. This film has an okay central idea but the building around it part just isn't any good.After an interesting start it just kind of meanders along without really going anywhere. Toss in a few chase scenes and before you know it you're at the end. The plot just sort of happens without really drawing you in, which highlights the one-trick pony show going on. It doesn't offer you any clues for you to try and work out, and when the ending happens you just kind of shrug.The writer had an interesting if cliched idea, but it's not enough on it's own to flesh out an entire film. Chuck in some superficial character stuff, a bit of man-goes-crazy obsession and before you know it, you've got a bad film.And then, at the end, comes The Twist. Which in this case sucks, by the way. It's weak, it's random, it's unconvincing.So how could it have been better? Well, the script needs some real work to lift it up a notch. The gimmick (ie, the mysterious murders) isn't enough. You need to create a story as well. This film never does that. The gimmick is everything, and ultimately drags the film down. Then unfortunately, the twist at the end is so general and vacuous that it's just a ""meh"" response.Why does the main character go crazy? There's no connection for him to cause that to happen. It's completely impersonal, and therefore unreasonable.The motivations of the antagonist are very bland.

It combines standard buddy cop tropes to set up the wider scope of the movie.The acting is very good, this isn't a cheesy action picture nor is it an overly serious drama.There are no glarinh paradoxes or loop holes that appear within the context of the film although this was review was after one viewing.Overall I found it a highly entertaining and suspenseful murder mystery cop film with a tinge of Sci Fi that provided me with a moral question upon the films end.A solid 7/10",In the Shadow of the Moon
86,RomanJamesHoffman,It's not often I feel cheated by a movie...,2,9 January 2020,"...but the ending of this movie, wow, I was so annoyed.Why? Well, the movie starts out fine - giving us a flash of the near future where something unspecifically bad has happened we are then thrown back to 1988, 1997, and 2006 in sequence following the growing obsession of Thomas Lockhart, a police-officer investigating an apparent serial killer. The deaths are apparently unrelated and particularly gruesome which effectively draws us into the case. Then as the movie begins to unravel the various aspects of the killings which defy logic, the movie shifts from a hard-boiled detective film and ventures into Sci-Fi territory and Lockhart has to sacrifice everything in his life in order to put the pieces together.Up to this point the movie is a completely serviceable mix of Sci-Fi and detective story, albeit broadcasting most of its ""twists"" from the outset. Until, that is, the very end of the movie where there is a personal twist which attempts to add pathos to what we've seen but which just comes across as hokey and manipulative. AND then - oh my - the (lol) political message of the movie which flat-out states that patriotism is the same as racism and that they all need to be killed cuz reasons.As a result, most of the reviews here fall into one of two camps - people that are put off by this. And those that say it's okay. I was put off by it because, basically, at the end I realised I'd spent two hours watching a flat-out piece of Leftist propaganda of the vilest kind. But even putting my own opinions aside, surely, in the divided political times we are currently in a movie which says ""it's morally right to kill people on the other side of the political spectrum"" is at best woefully misguided and at worst dangerously divisive.And the worst part about it all? It added NOTHING to the movie. In trying to be edgy and woke, it just comes off as a superficial end to the movie which ruins what came before.",In the Shadow of the Moon

101,verminhater,Not what you'll be expecting at all,7,27 September 2019,"Netflix have done it again with yet another well made and interesting movie. The trailer makes it seem like some kind of vampire film but that's a long way off the mark. The film is about a killer popping up at regular intervals with a very specific purpose and a cop spending half his life chasing them. It's no action film though, it's far better pigeon-holed as a thriller with the typical twist at the end. Once again Netflix procure a decent performance from the cast and crew producing a film that engrossed me. It's not fast paced and that will loose some viewers and it delivers a political message that will alienate those villanised (people who can't distinguish between free speech and hate) from enjoying it.
It's notable that once more Netflix go for a thought provoking film rather than the more usual Hollywood action template and I applaud them for it. It's a fair way from what I expected and all the better for it.",In the Shadow of the Moon

This whole premise is truly terrifying. Flashing repeatedly in the bad guy manifesto: ""Patriot, Nationalism, United States"", along with a flag that looks suspiciously like the ""Betsy Ross"" flag. Why the BLM - like protests when the ""serial killer"" WAS most definitely armed- the weapon was in evidence decades later?

Other gripes include the villain. Seems Brits or at least people who talk like them, still serve as panto villains in such movies... a ghastly wooden effort replete with nonsensical cardboard dialogue so worthy of onscreen boffins.
Lastly what was the title about? Sounds kind of sexy, moody even, but what was its relevance for this tale? I saw no shadows, not even the Moon that much if at all... it should have warned me of the daftness to come.

Which as we know, never is the answer to our problems.It gives such a bad answer to one of lives great questions, it'll leave you empty.

This is simply an action film not based on real life, its obviously not a true story , the heart of it is simply the idea that if you were to, for instance, wipe out Hitler or his parents you potentially save millions of people from all different backgrounds. so do you wipe out the few or let the millions die?

We have to admire that effort from the director as well as the art director. Well Done !!!.Acting of Locke was not exceptional but bit above average. Rhya's acting was really bad and felt that she was acting in the movie scenes.

I love especially time travel films. Primer is one of my favorite films. - A low budget time travel film that hurt my brain watching it. This isn't low budget. It had a good cast and some good special effects. The premise is good. A cop is on the hunt for a serial killer who is murdering random people with some sort of device that leaves 3 distinct puncture wounds at be base of the neck. Just exactly what this device is and where it comes from is a compelling mystery the cop needs to solve, along with how the killer chooses his victims.
Turns out the killer is a time traveler and she only murders every 9 years. Pretty mysterious stuff.
But this is where it all falls apart. The reason she murders every 9 years is so preposterous and the fact that the cop can't let the case go after aging 40 years is just so stupid and unbelievable that it made me sort of angry. The plot is absurd and seems particularly tailored towards a radical leftist audience which just seems to comes out of nowhere. This can only be described as agenda driven film making, and everything that was good about the film in the first hour of the film turns to mush in the second half of the film.

126,ninjawaiter,Wow that ending...,3,2 October 2019,"Even though certain elements of this film were quite predictable, I felt it was executed in a clever enough fashion to keep it entertaining and exciting. Right up until the ending, of course.SPOILERS:
As soon as I heard the serial killer was a young black woman I knew no one in PC Hollywood would dare make her the bad guy, so obviously all her seemingly random murders were going to be justified somehow. Honestly, I can't even blame Hollywood for that. Women are almost never serial killers, and because people don't understand statistics and population percentages, there is a general public perception that whites are the most likely to be serial killers. So when all the shiftless 'woke' activists with nothing better to do than protest learned there was a film featuring an evil black woman serial killer, they'd have burned the studio down (probably metaphorically). Hollywood exists to make money, and that's not how you do it. So yeah, the ""twist"" that she's actually justified was over before it even began, but that didn't really spoil the film. It was still interesting to see how it played out, and to try to figure out what the ""justification"" would be. (More on that later.)The traveling backward through time was equally easy to figure out, right from the first sequence when we found out she had a bullet wound from a service piece but no one had fired a shot. (You have to ignore the plot holes here. They WOULD have run the ballistics, particularly on the guy who witnessed her death, whether they thought his gun had been fired or not, and they'd have figured out the ballistics matched. Moreover, that gun was the property of the PPD. When he quit or got fired, they wouldn't have let him keep it.) Moreover, the ""I'm sorry about your partner,"" when it turned out his partner hadn't been killed was a dead giveaway that he was GOING to be killed, just in the next iteration.There were other things, of course, but ultimately these predictable elements were still up in the air enough that the good writing kept the whole thing interesting regardless.The problems were all with the ending of course. And not in a ""I didn't like the ending so it's bad,"" sort of way. This film reminded me a lot of 12 Monkeys, which I coincidentally just rewatched. The ending is similarly tragic, in that the character knows how it ends and can't stop it from happening. Except unlike 12 Monkeys, where everyone knows from the start that you can't change the past, only learn from it, this film has the whole thing ass-backward.The main character can't change the past of how things play out with the time traveling assassin, but the time traveling assassin CAN change the past of the terrible event she's trying to prevent. It's self-contradictory. Either the past can be changed or it can't. Even worse, in the assassin's timeline she learns who he is on her first trip back in time. All she needs to do in the second one, or the third, or even the fourth when it's all messed up already, is tell him who she is. But she doesn't, because REASONS. No really, there are no reasons. She just doesn't do it, because it would spoil the plot. Only the ending reveals that the plot is nonsensical for this reason, so... Yeah, that's just bad writing.But it's worse than that. 12 Monkeys is tragic because the good guy fails, the bad guy wins, and the world as we know it ends. This movie is written to be the opposite, where the twist is that the guy we've been following is NOT the good guy- the good guy is the time traveling assassin who we have to assume succeeds in ""saving the world.""But this is where it goes totally Watchmen on us. The assassin is murdering innocent people who might have somehow influenced someone else in a way that causes those other people to engage in acts of evil which in turn influence other people to engage in evil in a vicious spiral of horror. But don't lose the forest in all those trees. The assassin is murdering innocent people. Period. Full stop.This isn't ""going back to kill Hitler to prevent WWII."" This is going back to kill Hitler's innocent music teacher who damaged his fragile psyche as a child by giving him a scolding that would have been beneficial to any normal child. And his innocent history teacher for instilling in him a sense of pride in German history. And killing some random radio announcer in England who said something negative about the Weimar Republic and got Hitler thinking, ""I should overthrow this thing."" The guy who created time travel in the film says exactly that. Anyone they have to kill to achieve their goal, no matter how innocent.Make no mistake, these people are MONSTERS. In the Watchmen the big twist is that superheroes are just flawed people who don't always do the right thing or even agree on what the right thing is, but even in that morally relative story the real ""heroes"" do everything in their power to stop Ozymandias from murdering innocent people ""for the greater good."" They're just too late. Even then they can't agree on whether it's best to accept the atrocity and try to make the most of it or to expose Ozymandias for his horrible crimes, and to the writers' credit, the give the final word to the only guy who stands by his principles and the truth.But in this film the hero arrives in time. He has a chance to stop the monster before all the innocents die. And he decides not to. In fact, the entire twist and tone are arranged as if we're supposed to be on the monster's side. Oh, she's murdering innocent people ""for the greater good!"" In that case, help yourself! Geeze, don't we feel like jerks for trying to save those innocents.Look, moral philosophy is tough. There are no clear cut right and wrong answers or dividing lines. That's why great minds have been debating these subjects for as long as humans have been around. But if you came away from this film thinking, ""Yeah, the time traveling assassin is right..."" Well, I just hope you're never in any sort of position of power or public trust, because with that kind of thinking there is literally no atrocity you can't and won't justify. If you're not willing to draw the line at intentionally brutally murdering innocent people, where DO you draw the line?So yeah, I this film was on track to receive a much higher rating until the very end when its plot fell apart with the whole self-contradictory time travel nonsense, and its tone went completely inverted with the ""evil is okay if we're doing it for a good cause,"" thing.",In the Shadow of the Moon

Except I'm deducting 3 for stupid plot holes, and 3 for dark evil messaging",4,7 October 2019,"This one had enough plot holes big enough to drive a bus through, a train, cruise ship, and dwarf planet or large moon.The movie basically lays out the premise that it's a deterministic universe, where time travel can't really change the course of history, BUT it's good to murder people to try to change that which can't be changed. The writer, actors, and director literally deliver that message. But you'll have to wade through the first, second, and part of the third act to get it. So, I'm taking 3 stars off for what otherwise would be a 10-star film.Next, it's a dark message. To prevent a civil war in the future, which can't be prevented, we must kill enough of the right (literally) people, including those that inspire them. Thank God the murder is stopped in 1988 because I believe had the murderer not been stopped, she'd have kept going back to kill Thomas Jefferson, Ben Franklin, George Washington, and the rest of the founding fathers. Because America is evil, and the founding fathers' crazy ideas about individual liberty are evil. Oh, and the liberal, libertarian, and conservative people inspired by such ideas deserve to be killed. You'll see examples of these 'evil books' containing these evil anti-socialist liberal ideas spread throughout the movie. So, I'm deducting another 3 stars from what would have been a 7-star movie for presenting such a dark and evil idea as good. What is wrong with Hollywood today?That knocks this 10-star movie down to 4 stars, which it deserves for the great acting, and professional production value.

130,draciron,An almost interesting fairy tale.,5,9 October 2019,"The good.
Original plot twists, a couple which may have never been done in a major movie before. Though the theme and core idea borrows heavily from 12 Monkeys.The movie does build suspense and a dark brooding atmosphere like 12 monkeys did in the first hour, then unravels as the plot is thrust unwillingly into an otherwise good story. You can almost think of it as 2 movies in 1. The first movie is well acted, directed, with excellent sound and decent action scenes. A little over the top but mild compared to the drivel Hollywood is producing today.The bad.
This film could have seriously benefited from a science adviser. This is what initially kills suspension of belief as the, I cannot call it even pseudo science, it's not even good magic, begins to degrade the story and tug the viewer away. This destroys the suspense and the big reveal is not even a weak anti-climax.Huge plot holes develop as the writers lose track of what wrote previously. This throws you out, and before you can get lured back into the fantasy they commit another egregious error. The specifics would give away the entire movie, so are omitted, but clearly no one with even a high school physics course, the most rudimentary understandings of sociology, psychology or really any branch of physics, especially biology, all are not even given cartoon like salutes. The story just steamrolls through blunder after blunder.Now for the really ugly.
The political bias just leaves a bad taste in one's mouth. It's scary that even a child could buy into a plot idea so naive, much less destroy what otherwise could have been an excellent film. I strongly suspect the first half of this movie was stolen from another story. It starts too well, flows too well to be hacked by such oafish hands in the last half of the movie. There were a million ways this movie could have developed, but the least plausible and most predictable was chosen.By yanking the viewer out so violently the one really inspired plot twist is aborted and thrown to the floor to thrash in artistic agony.In the end it becomes a really pale imitation of 13 monkeys without the hard hitting story. that made 13 monkeys such an incredible movie. My advice, watch the first hour then turn the movie off. Be left with the magic they were able to conjure without the corpse they eventually produce.",In the Shadow of the Moon
131,imjaredross,Interesting Premise Decent Film,6,30 September 2019,"In the Shadow of the Moon is a new Netflix Original film from director Jim Mickle. I'm a sucker for a good mystery film revolving around a serial killer. David Fincher's Zodiac as well as his earlier film Seven being prime examples of a film like this done right. However, what makes In the Shadow of the Moon interesting is how it tries to separate itself from these types of films by doing something completely different.In the Shadow of the Moon takes its manhunt premise and gives it a new spin while still giving us the staples of the genre. We have the overworked police detective with family troubles who is witness to tragedy and who's life falls apart throughout the film. It spans multiple year as the detective grows more and more obsessed. These are things we've seen before and for the most part they are done fairly well.The performances are quite good as well. Boyd Holbrook being our lead proves he can carry a film and watching him devolve into a drunkard, slob throughout the film is at times hard to watch and his performance always keeps you caring and at least invested in his character. The film also looks very nice. In fact all the technical aspects of the film are worthy of praise even down to the soundtrack which at times feels more like Hans Zimmers Interstellar but remains a standout part of the film.However, this film fails in the execution of its premise. Though this movie does things a little different with its mystery by making it a time bending thriller of sorts it begins to lose momentum once we get into the real meat of the film. It starts to become standard, familiar and a tad cliche with tropes you have seen plenty of times before.The premise is interesting enough to keep you watching for it's almost 2hr runtime, but what starts out with promise eventually becomes rather bland and unfulfilling by the end. Performances are solid and all technical aspects work out fine, but it's not going to be a film I'm going to revisit past my initial watch.",In the Shadow of the Moon

This movie is okay but any amount of ""what if"" thinking tears it to pieces. The ending makes no sense and just fucking leaving a napkin with ""I'm your granddaughter from the future, you're right, I'm sorry, just reconnect with your daughter"" would have solved, like, all of it.The second one, I don't really get? Like, Nazis exist, that's a fact and there's over 200 militias with white supremacist manifestos in America today. But that's pretty much it, for race relations. White cop kills a black woman? That's reality. But we know that he wasn't racist and that's the entire movie plot.What we KNOW and what we are TOLD aren't always in line. The truth and the reality and the path we're on are all a collection of choices and experiences that cloud who we are... That's the entire point of the film.It wasn't perfect, but it was fun and sad and interesting. I like these movies, I just wish people who hate discussing racism or even mentioning that people are different would stop rating bombing movies and shows discussing them.Your anger about politics isn't a review, your 1/10 review because ""racism doesn't exist!!!!"" isn't a review.

As most of the other reviewers have stated - the first half of this movie is excellent until it devolves into useless, kindergarden fluff replete with virtue signaling. Two woke writers continue to pile on the same nonsense to ruin what might have been a decent story and spent virtually no time whatsoever in trying to explain why any of it makes sense.In short: A police detective is investigating several murders where a mysterious hooded figure murders 3 people and, in chasing her, she tells him things she shouldn't know. And then you follow the detective through the rabbit hole and his obsession to solve a developing puzzle which gets more ridiculous as it moves along.Boyd Holbrook is excellent in his role and Hall does his small part. The first half of the film is rich in dialogue between our main players and good scenery. It's as if they only planned the whole film to be 50% of the running length and the rest and lazy, slow reveal that bears no real thought about science fiction issues. It's the type of silly conversation you'd have in kindergarden with what-if fantasies that don't need to make much sense, the exact opposite of the way Christopher Nolan carefully crafts his scripts to make sure they at least have some adult level of sophistication.What makes this film even worse is that the great ""twist"" is nothing more than another vague joke about who is responsible for the great apocalypse you see at the beginning of the film, without putting much thought into it. Certain people = good. Other people = bad. That's the extent of it and you, the viewer, are supposed to put the rest into place the same way to ultra-woke Hollywood writers think is innate. Good luck with that. Not worth the rental but, if you must watch, once you hit the halfway point skip to the end for the long winded silly reveal.",In the Shadow of the Moon

137,fewald139,Stylized and tantalizing mix of police procedural crime thriller & sci-fi,9,27 September 2019,"Edit: I realized only after submitting this review and getting tons of unhelpful votes that this movie has been heavily politicized and there are floods of people down-voting any positive review not for its content, but for its rating. For what it's worth, I cover the ambiguity of the movie's moral lessons in my review (that many clearly didn't read before down-voting). I happened to like that ""is this really for the best?"" ambiguity that ending entailed. Not once did I find this movie to be beating the viewer over the head with a political message; if anything, I found it opened one's eyes to the possibility that ""for the greater good"" is a flawed concept. I hate that this movie has been so politicized; as a centrist myself, I found no political slant to the movie and was surprised to hear of people wanting to boycott it. In this awful ""cancel culture"" waged by both sides of the political divide, I welcome movies like this that make viewers THINK. After all, if people are calling for a piece of art to be boycotted, you can be sure it has ruffled enough feathers to be a worthwhile discussion piece. So if you're a potential viewer hoping to avoid political bias, I say go into this with an open mind. I didn't find it as cut and dry as others, but then again, I'm not easily offended in the slightest.""You're crazy,"" Locke says at one point when speaking to a man on one side of this moral debacle.""I think we're both beyond the pale,"" the enemy replies.THIS quote is apt, neatly laying out what I believe the true intent was for this movie. The murders committed are awful. The crimes they prevented were awful. Both sides are beyond the pale, mirroring the political divide happening around this movie's message that neither extreme can be a hero. How ironic; the controversy surrounding In the Shadow of the Moon matches its outlook. Now, on to the original review.In the Shadow of the Moon somehow takes multiple genres and mashes them together to come up with a highly unique viewing experience that actually works. Locke is a cop on the job in 1988 when he investigates a series of mysterious murders that all happen at the same time and have multiple ties that baffle detectives and forensic investigators alike. So begins a chase over the decades involving a cop who slowly mentally degrades and a suspect who can't seem to be caught or killed. Another review stated the twist is too expected, yet they also said the movie could've been less convoluted, which sounded conflicted to me. The fact that the storyline was so complex and yet so easily understood worked well in this movie's favor, in my opinion. Because we follow the viewpoint of an investigator throughout the movie, we can slowly unravel the pieces to the puzzle alongside him so that the movie feels complete and satisfying without relying on plot holes or the convenience of confusing its audience by pulling the ""because it's sci-fi!"" card.Who is Boyd Holbrook, and why the heck isn't he in more stuff? This was the first time I've seen him in anything. He did a fantastic job playing Locke. His character evolves so greatly throughout the movie, and he played each step believably and was a delight to watch. Cleopatra Coleman served her role as Rya well, but I wasn't as impressed with her usually stone-faced performance. She was believable, but she didn't stand out. Bokeem Woodbine was fantastic as Locke's partner Maddox. The sound design in this movie is outstanding, mixing distortion and music to ideally fit the mysterious but enthralling action pieces (particularly the first set of murders in '88 that are shown within the first ten minutes). The cinematography was fantastic to the point of being noticeable. This movie sucks you into its world and immerses you, its long takes allowing you time to focus on its plotline one decade at a time. In the Shadow of the Moon somehow is able to pull off multiple decades believably without relying on bashing the audience over the head with distracting nostalgia. Finally, while the movie starts out viewing these crimes as murders and ends up explaining the snowball effect leading up to them, it opens the door for philosophical questions regarding morality and time travel. I love, love, love thought-provoking movies like this.If I have any complaints about In the Shadow of the Moon, it's that once the police thriller dissipates (as Locke becomes more deranged and isolated) and holds hands with the final sci-fi act, it slows down a little in pace. I was still glued to the screen as all story arcs began to merge and close, don't get me wrong, but the gritty city feel from the first half was so well-done I craved more and more. But looking over the movie with a critical lens, I can't see that they could've pulled it off any other way. This slowdown was necessary to the plot, and the development of both the story and the characters (particularly Locke) were handled with delicacy.Overall, this is one Netflix movie you need to put on your queue and give a shot. Netflix has a lot of misses you have to dig through to find stuff like this. You might not love In the Shadow of the Moon as much as I did because tastes are subjective, but it is undoubtedly a well-directed and put together movie with a unique merge of genres that you owe it to yourself to try.

This is very strange. And you would never see any other country do that.

161,opiaterein,"Fun action, dangerously foolish philosophy",4,23 March 2021,"I wouldn't be writing this review if not for the ideas that form the core of what the story is built on. However, to avoid any potential spoilers above the fold, I'll try it to at least write a few lines about the movie itself before critiquing the idea so that that spoil will be below the bar.
The Sci-Fi and mystery aspects of the movie are enjoyable enough. Not especially original, but executed in a way that there is still some level of suspense. Honestly there is probably nothing in this movie that is strictly original. While not directly derivative of any one source, every idea here has been done in a more enjoyable fashion somewhere else.
I think that should be enough to get this point below the fold, so now I'll proceed to criticize the premise that the plot is built on.The story follows a man tracking the actions of a woman who has traveled back to the past, indeed many points in the past, in order to prevent dangerous and hateful ideologies from taking hold in people who will ultimately commit horrible acts of terror and violence in the name of their own supposed superiority. How? By killing them and their ancestors. The idea is that their ideas can be erased and their hate will go along with it and that everything will end up, if not fine, then at least less bad than it would have been.It shouldn't take a genius to recognize immediately that this is not only moronic but dangerous. If you think that killing people who disagree with you is not only going to make them more hateful and fearful of you and those like you, your power of thought are dangerously lacking. A black assassin killing white supremacists is only going to make them spew more hate and bile. In their eyes, you are proving their point. You are proving in their eyes that you are dangerous and must be stopped. You are an exact mirror of them.The only way to fight bad ideas, including hateful ones, is to crush them with better ideas. If you can't convince people that you are right and the people who are wrong are in fact wrong, and can only achieve your goal by taking life, the only thing you are going to convince them is that you will kill to have your way. Even if your view is the right one, this can only end in tragedy and disaster. That is a simple fact, perhaps an unfortunate one based in the inherent imperfection of the human being, but like it or not, the only thing that destroys bad ideas is good ideas, and murdering the people that have bad ideas is not going to stop these bad ideas from spreading.

162,HeroOfTomorrow,A tedious two-hour plothole,2,13 March 2021,"Wow. I went into this with low-to-no expectations, and it still managed to get at least dozen ""wait, what?!""-s out of us during viewing. A visually bland, poorly written mess, this movie tries to be Minority Report meets Looper and Predestination, yet comes across as a first draft written by a mediocre film student. We were absolutely shocked by the number of gaping plotholes (some of which could've been fixed quite easily with an extra shot or an extra line of dialogue), but the most challenging one for us was that the premise literally makes no sense. Bear with me here:This movie literally forgets to connect the dots between the two main plot points. See, on the one hand you have ""person from the future has to stop terrorists before they strike"", and on the other hand you have ""cop is involved in this case, and the person from the future turns out to be his granddaughter.""...but... why? He has nothing to do with the terrorists, only finding out the main terrorism plot 3/4ths of the way through the film. Seriously, think about this. There isn't a single narrative reason or throughline for her being his granddaughter. Their goals and objectives are utterly disconnected throughout the film. It's hilarious that nobody recognized this (or cared enough) to fix this. Hence, the ""twist"" in this movie has no weight because it makes zero sense.And there's something that might be even worse: the ""isotope shot"" she gives the marks allows them to be killed from the future. But... why?! If you're already there to inject them with needles, why not just SHOOT THEM? it's about stopping terrorists! This movie is ridiculous.And that's the big kahuna. But the movie is peppered with ridiculous plot contrivances, bad filmmaking and terrible exposition scenes. Think about these 1. the scientific world would be flipped on its head getting access to literal future tech. But no, it's literally kept in... an evidence box. 2. People are protesting the ""killing of an unarmed black woman""... who murdered three people, broke one cop's leg and beat the crap out of another... and how on earth do you do they even know that she was pushed in front of a train at ALL?! 3.

164,BLAlley,Familiar but with some new elements,8,3 October 2019,"After several other recent offerings from Netflix I've become skeptical, but being a sucker for mysteries and time travel and having Boyd Holbrook starring prompted me to give this a watch.
Unlike those previous disappointments, In The Shadow of the Moon establishes believable characters who are likable enough to keep me engaged. The story played out well and continued to add interesting bits to a mildly predictable yet satisfying conclusion. What I appreciated was the focus on the characters and moral dilemma rather than the gimmick. In fact, we don;t even see it or learn who is responsible until well into the story as the mystery unfolds. That is the case with most good scifi.
Those criticizing the movie as propaganda and accusing it of encouraging violence completely missed the point. The story follows the antagonist as she attempts to stop multiple acts of mass murder by committing selective acts of violence against a relative few individuals. What the critics of the movie are overlooking is the fact she pays the ultimate price for her cause, presenting the same questions for both sides of the debate: ""Do the ends justify the means?"" and ""Who decides?"". In The Shadow of the Moon is an examination of that question from both perspectives, and to suggest it incites violence is absurd since no one can be made to commit an act of violence, they must be predisposed to doing so.

Good performance by all actors. Have seen such a movie after a long time. Thoroughly enjoyed it Didn't want to spoil it so very little said. This movie is 8 out of 10 for me.,In the Shadow of the Moon
175,nellz_nivlecn,Its a Science Fiction Movie,6,4 October 2020,"Well I thought this was a crime thriller honestly. You wouldnt know this was a science fiction movie until halfway through the runtime.Where to begin? It started with one night, on three different places and at the same time, three person suddenly bleeds brain matter out of their noses, mouths, ears and they died. It was disturbing but interesting, and thanks to this movie I will always know what a hollow head sounds like. That 'thunk-thunk' sounds. Chilling stuff.It was then suggested as the work of a serial killer. Brilliant, it was an unseen method before and it was very intriguing. So many questions popped in my head, who did this? Was it a new type of poison? And most importantly, why?And so the first 50 minutes of this movie was absolutely amazing, our main character is a police officer eager for promotion so he tries to solved this mystery and got pretty fast on tracking the killer, so a chasing scene ensue. The pacing was great, our attention was constantly kept on the screen, the chasing scene were good and the element of mystery was spot on.That is until halfway through the movie *SPOILER ALERT* it was revealed that this is a time travel movie. A science fiction time travel. The killer was sent from the future every nine years to inject the victim with the isotopes that activates from the future. Why? Because the victims was a bunch of people who would cause the future civil war, and it was implied that race was the motivation for the civil war.Now usually I do love time traveling movie, science fiction has always been one of my favorite genre of movies. Take example Looper. But this movie, it just detracts, they had a good momentum in the first 50 minutes, it was a great build up, great mystery and great pacing. A solid crime thriller. I get that they were probably trying something new here, but for me it just doesnt work.Sum it up, Its a science fiction movie but the motives is not strong enough and not quiet befitting that of a science fiction.And the revelation at the end, its uh not good. So our main character Lock knows why these people got killed. He knows why the killer killed them, and because he is a cop at heart, he is still bent on stopping her because killing is wrong. That is until she revealed that she was his grand daughter. No moral dilemma whatsoever, Lock just stopped pursuing her. So he straighten up and got his life back together to then nurture the killer. Wow, I didnt realize how much I did not like this ending until I write this. Sigh.Solid first 50 minutes, really enjoying that part, and another good thing in this movie is Boyd Holbrook's performance. He was good in this, I've always thought of him as another pretty face actor who gets by with his looks but he proved me wrong here. He gave a nuanced performance, portraying a man on the fringe barely holding on, the only thing that keeps him going was his obssesions. So kudos to the moviemaker for casting Boyd. Looking forward to see him in future projects.",In the Shadow of the Moon

Its like terminator had a daughter and went back in time to kill a lethal weapon knock off. Did it work? Well, its alright. Boyd has proven that he can lead a movie and not be flopped by the Predator. I'm not sure why they casted Mr. Hall for his character was hardly used. They could have grabbed a lesser known actor for that part. The writing unfortunately suffered in this film for it did not know where it wanted to go. You have scenes that play out but do not really go anywhere. One of my biggest annoyances was how they did not age Boyd's character at all until the last 9 years. Aging is not the hardest effect to do when you dealing with time travel effects. The twist was pretty lackluster and it sends a message that wasn't really driven in the movie. I feel they should have slowed down just a little bit on all the set pieces and focused more on the characters so the message would have been impactful. The first 40 minutes we had so many short scenes take place. Over all its a watchable film but not one you will remember.",In the Shadow of the Moon

Boyd Holbrook recently disappointed me in a couple of films and I went into this with an air of uncertainty. I'm happy to say that he acted superbly throughout. This movie manages to grip you early with the shocking nature of the murders and carries on with a mysterious storyline. There are some excellently depicted emotions, the tale of a man who spends years trying to figure out what is going on. I urge you to welcome the creativity and please give this movie a chance.CJR8/10",In the Shadow of the Moon

181,sergeman_ec-133-265180,Excellent movie,10,28 September 2019,"I found this movie truly engaging. What I find mildly disturbing is how many reviewers have a tendency to want to quiet down anything that even remotely has a political message.
The movie harkens back to some episodes of the different series of Star Trek involving time travel and changing potential futures by modifying the past. It also has The Terminator as an obvious influence.
What some reviewers tend to forget is that the present political climate in the United States and in many other places around the world (like many countries in Europe) will OBVIOUSLY influence filmmakers. You cannot use the tired, age-old adage of ""just shut up and entertain me"" because that has NEVER WORKED WITH ARTISTS.
If this kind of movie makes you nervous because of what the filmmakers are saying, then maybe it speaks more of you than them and any agenda they might have.
If the idea of going back and killing an idea before it spreads makes you nervous, then maybe you should reconsider how blind some people are to freedom of speech. Like it's been said so many times, freedom of speech should always be respected, yes. But it should not give certain people the right to walk into a crowded theater and yell ""fire!"". Sounds familiar? Of course it does! People have been saying that for years. And those who defend freedom of speech at ANY COST must realize that sometimes that freedom will end up giving some people certain ideas, that ideas spread, and it only takes a second for those ideas to turn into actions.
So yes, this movie is great! It speaks of what is going on in the world today, not just in the United States but in many places around the globe. It uses science fiction as a filter to see what lies in our societies today.
That's what good science fiction does.",In the Shadow of the Moon

Then, the entire ying and yang of time travel while he's trying to kill his granddaughter. Most of the reviews I've read hate the ending, but I loved it. Hell ya, the tight little bubble plot of how everyone and everything is connected. The flying pigs scene in the van during the fight was my favorite. Great job directors, producers! I watched that scene 10 times because of the slow motion effects.

188,stellbread,Definitely Appeals to Action Fans,9,8 October 2019,"If you like action, this one will definitely sate your appetite. There's not a wasted scene in this thriller that pits Philadelphia detective Thomas Lockhart (Holbrook) against a serial killer who doesn't match the usual profile. This killer is black and female(Cleopatra Coleman). More harrowing is the fact she doesn't kill in typical fashion.Director Jim Mickle manages the right tempo as Lockhart's pursuit segues from a serial killer investigation to a matter with a supernatural twist. Joining him on the case is sidekick Maddox (Bokeen Woodbine). Woodbine, per his custom, plays Maddox with a subdued believability. Their ensuing chase of the killer leaves their boss (and Lockhart's brother-in-law, played by Michael C. Hall) doubtful of his sanity.In the Shadow of the Moon keeps you rapt until its gut-wrenching climax. Too bad it was a straight to TV movie, for it definitely merited better treatment than the plethora of bad horror films that keep finding their way into theaters.",In the Shadow of the Moon

It's refreshing to find a mid-range budgeted thriller. The film is a stouthearted to attempt high concept storytelling and for the better part of the running time it works. There are some strong imperfections, but if you can go with the film, you'll enjoy the twists and turns. The screen play, and the way the plot was designed, as well as the combo of Sci-Fi and Mystery was mind blowing and anew.

They could have picked so many different ways to handle this concept but they went all Hollywood and assumed all white people are homicidal fascists. The message of the movie is patriotism is terrorism. Sorry, I can't forgive such a hateful message.In spite of the message, the acting and writing was subpar also. Definitely felt like a B Grade movie, something Netflix seems to flock to. They gotta start putting out quality or I fear they are going to die on the vine.So if feeling a sense of guilt for being born with white skin and watching a movie that was made by fifth graders is your thing, look no further then this.

And the movie is spent connecting the dots.And the viewer is okay the end is tying up the mystery of the beautiful young and murderous time traveler who then becomes our narrator. The loose end is one of the murder victims made an amateur bomb in the future, and it appears the others thought about making one. The bomb was very deadly, according to the narrator, which in turn caused a civil war.

211,SenorLengua,We've seen this before...,5,3 April 2021,"How many movies have we seen where family members of similar age have a similar or the same career where one struggles and the other succeeds? The list of movies like that is going to be very long, and the protagonist is usually the one who struggles, because drama. The struggle could be infidelity, or death of a spouse/child, drug use and abuse, or some kind of unhealthy obsession. This latter part is what we see often in police dramas. And with this movie, it is no different.Now, this does not mean it can't be a good movie. This could be The Godfather, The King's Speech, The Lion King, Rachel's Getting Married, and for a more humorous take, Ferris Buhler's Day Off (to name just a few). Unfortunately, In the Shadow of the Moon (forth called Shadow) is not any of those. As you will know from the trailers and perhaps some reviews on some list somewhere, the basic plot is trying to find a killer who appears on one day every 9 years. Okay, sure, but...?The 9 years part is explained, but only briefly. As a scifi movie, I was left wanting more of a dive into that aspect. There is a second aspect to this 9 year event which I won't spoil, but it also was not explored more and also left me wanting more. The tricky part of Shadow, really, is that it takes the main character, Locke (played by Boyd Holbrook), and advances him to that single day on the 9 year period. The changes are mostly visual to the character (think beard growth), but it really was not enough. There should have been an accompanying change in color or blatant style, or language usage. Unfortunately, it mostly focused on the continual fall into the obsession. I say this because at one point, Locke's daughter (Amy, played by Sarah Dugdale) appears and her look is quite jarring and is a very clear signal time has emotionally changed both of them. The one scene when he picks her up from school and drives her ""home"" is the best in the movie. But even then...I started watching this over dinner, as I often do streaming movies. But quite quickly found myself distracted by other things (such as skimming the news). I also paused the movie a few times when I got distracted by something I read. But I did finish the movie. It kept poking at a potential grandness, and the score was appropriately dramatic (and probably better than the movie, itself). But at the end of the day, Shadow finished with an all too typical set of clichés which didn't really make sense, and didn't appropriately tie up the movie.If you watch it, do so for Sarah Dugdale. I found her the best part of the movie. But I don't recommend wasting your time. Watch something else.I'm giving it a 5, because it wasn't terrible.

While it's common knowledge they friends and family come to IMDb to boost scores, I'm starting to believe Hollywood and it's fans are intentionally throwing bombs here so Netflix movies look worse than they are. No, this is not amazingly creative movie, but it's refreshing to watch because while it fits some clichés, it didn't blindly follow set of those imposed by Hollywood. Netflix, personally, brings back the feeling of classic sci-fi as much as it is possible with today's market poisoned with Hollywood and Disney who buy off things and make them conform to ratings. At least Netflix tries to reinvigorate the spirit in movies, while trying to stay competitive in a market of brainwashed audience. It's not really an 8, but I have it 9 to counter those who came to ruin the rating. It's probably 7.1 movie.

The people being killed, weren't actually involved in the terrorists attack, or any violence as far as we can tell.

Then Locke leaves his partner injured without using his radio to call for help to chase the suspect. A lot of reviewer talk about the agenda of this film and while they are on the right track they miss the important bit about the fact that this show is about thought control and that is a common theme in movies and other movies do a better job than this one. ultimately they are attempting to send the message that we should love each other and be more forgiving then we are today. we all know this but we all fail a little or a lot each day.

248,Djervig,"Very stimulating narrative, but fails to deliver at the climax",7,29 September 2019,"I was completely absorbed in the mystery throughout most of the movie -but the reveal at the end was disappointing and had a very odd moral if it had any.
I was so excited that the antagonist of this movie was not the same ethnicity as the protagonist, as I feared from the very beginning that they might be related, but assumed they weren't. Unfortunately they were.
It's the oldest time travel trick in the book and this movie added little on the matter, except how out antagonist was ultimately left with the dilemma of sacrificing his granddaughter for his wife, a choice he made somewhat callously and without giving the audience any significant insight into his thought process. The climax was, to say the least, incredibly disappointing. Throughout the entire beach scene, I was expecting him to call her bluff, shot her and reset the story, a time loop would frankly have been more satisfying. The ending didn't make much sense either. The antagonist/granddaughter claimed that her death could not be changed - but the entire movie was about changing events in time - surely with some time and effort they could have come up with a better solution. Beyond that, would them erasing the terrorist also not just reset the timeline, as they would never have a reason to travel back, or will he still have to sacrifice his daughter to the cheap good/evil scientist who plays god, but somehow is also the good guy in the end. If this does not reset the timeline, we must assume that we have 2 separate timelines. One in which there is no time traveler, no mystery, but the terror attack happens, which spurs our protagonist to send out antagonist back in time, creating a second timeline, by killing people, preventing the terror attack and completely changing the timeline of her grandfather, this is the timeline we follow in the movie. Yet somehow this second timeline still results in his daughter giving birth to the same girl from the first timeline - we are led to assume - but how is this possible. Even if the protagonists wife dies in both timelines, the relationship between the protagonist and his daughter would have been completely different in the two timelines assuming that he would not have spend his life searching for this mystery killer. Hence the odds of the daughter birthing the same person in both timelines are 0. It is a statistical impossibility. The sci in this fi is not well thought out.And what was up with the moral compass of this movie. Might does not make right, and just because you can travel through time and melt peoples minds for thinking bad thoughts that will lead to bad actions, does not mean that a more measured approach does not exist when you have a freaking time machine on your hand. How about using the time machine to just go back in time and prevent the bomb going off? Ever thought of that?Dear screenwriters. A mysteries character in a movie does not always have to
be related to the protagonist. There a 7 billion people on this planet, so you should think that it was possible to write a story where all the characters aren't from the same family tree.
Stop portraying scientists as evil. In reality there is a huge correlation between idiocy and cruelty, and scientist are a pretty peaceful bunch.
And if you have time travel at your disposal, perhaps try coming up with something more elegant than melting peoples brains. Violence is so utterly unimaginative.",In the Shadow of the Moon
249,stevie-parmentier-360-779691,A decent movie but predictable and without a satisfying ending,5,22 October 2019,"I don't mind low budget scifi movies because the lack of a massive CGI budget means they have to be more clever and low-key about how they approach the plot and this movie does exactly that.The movie follows a policeman through his life who investigates mysterious murders which happen every 9 years. It's a nice premise and there is very little actual scifi stuff involved in 99% of the movie. You also see the character grow and see those around how grow older which is nice but the movie is too short to give this aspect enough depth.Where the movie stumbles, is in its plot twist near the end. I made a prediction in the first half hour which turned out to be true. I won't spoil it here but I'm sure many of you will make the same educated guess and won't be surprised when the big reveal is made.The nature of the movie also means the emotional aspect falls flat. Besides the main character and his partner cop, you don't really connect with anyone and the attempts at emotion doesn't quite work since the movie jumps 9 years at a time.Another thing that bugs me, is the modern woke ""white men are evil"" message that seems to return in so many movies lately and this is very noticeable in this movie (heck, it's the entire foundation of what the story is about). I like my movies to be less political than this ...In the end, it's an OK movie to watch and then to forget.

251,itsoferrall,Don't listen to the bad reviews.,7,10 December 2019,"The movie was a really good one. The time travel concept is done quite well because they don't try to over explain it. They even joke about it in the movie. I want to speak about the amazing concept of who rya really is and how it was a lot of fun piecing together together her encounters with the main character-who turns out to be familiar to her.I've seen a lot of people complain about some things that rya has said. And I'm here to refute them.1. When rya apologizes for what she did to Maddox you will see reviews about people saying that's when they knew he would be killed-that's wrong. She had just beat him up and broke his leg, which you see from after that moment he walks with a limp for the rest of his life until she eventually kills him by complete accident.2. When she says her death can't be changed she is right. He killed her in the past, so once he reaches the point of which rya is at the age when she goes back in time to die, that can't be undone because she dies On her last trip and she's told about it on her first trip back in time. So even though she's dying in the past she is just being told about her future death. Which makes sense if you actually sit down and think about it.3. Relating to the #2- the apocalypse is changed because she completed her mission. Even though she died. She died on her last trip to the past which means she died right after completing her mission. Which was infecting everyone from the white supremacy group with the device from the future that kills everyone by detonation which you see at the very end. Everyone infected was killed at the same time, even though it looks like they happened 9 years apart.For rya to be saved from dying her grandfather would have to wait another 9 years to try and go back to that night where she was killed and stop him from doing it. Which would have stopped him from continuously pursuing her which eventually led to him convincing her to take on the mission in the first place.She was supposed to die, he was supposed to keep chasing. He gave up his life by chasing her and she gave up her life by letting him kill her to change the world.Great story.",In the Shadow of the Moon

Everything that happens, happens - even though that would mean, as someone else pointed out here already, that the bomb attack that leads to the civil war is inevitable, too. Even more puzzling is the fact that her grandfather, given all the info he got now, wouldn't do everything so his granddaughter doesn't turn into a time traveling murderer á la Terminator and, even worse, gets killed at a very young age - by himself!!! How insane is the idea that it is better to kill your own grandchild than face the consequences we humans have brought on ourselves? How does he live for one second after learning that? And given how murderous the combined history of mankind had been I wonder how killing a few right wing crazies would bring peace forever? Or will the Indian time travel police go on and on until there's nothing left to kill off?BTW, why doesn't that main guy (forgot the name, I mean that narcos guy...) commit suicide, which most definitely would stop the timeline - because we can see at the end (when no bomb exploded) that certain actions indeed change the future.

260,buddymakesdo,In the Shadow of the Moon...deserves to stay in the shadows,1,9 October 2019,"The poster for the movie shows a shot of Boyd Holbrook which makes him look vaguely South Asian and dark skinned. That's your first clue. As soon as I started watching, the true purpose of this film oozed out like melted brains (the calling card of the murders). No subtlety here at all. The story--in a nutshell--is about a cross-time causality and a White cop's struggle to seek justice on the surface, but this is a thin vehicle for the actual purpose of this film: social justice multiculturalism and Leftist indoctrination. Central to the plot is the notion that some ideas mustn't ever be allowed to exist and that wiping out the people who have this 'Wrong-Think' is somehow justified. Instead of sending back an agent to just shot these folks to prevent an future American Civil War, the script-writer introduces a highly-convoluted technical bit of mayhem: the assassin injects them with a glowing blue goo that a Silicon Valley Technark in the future activates to melt their brains (he practices on pigs first in the present). Seems a bit unnecessary and stupid, doesn't it? Also the plot conceit of having the Moon in phase every 9 years to 'permit' time travel because of gravitational irregularities? Ridiculous. Seems forced, like they liked the title so much they just had to include it. Of course, all the victims are White and the implication is that they are drug-addled rebel inbreds worthy of extermination for no other reason than that. The keystone is the inter-racial marriage of the protagonist cop's daughter and his mulatto grand-daughter turning out to be the assassin. His partner is Black and the blue-goo creator/scientist is a very dark skinned South Asian. If you like weak science, weaker dialogue and stunningly pedestrian performances (even by Boyd Holbrook and Michael C.

More of Warning than a spoiler but this movie has a big time travel plot, if you watched the trailer you could have guessed that, I wish I'd watched the trailer, I wouldn't have had my hopes up, it starts off well, but the second and third act just seem to get dumber and dumber. I think that is a lot to do with the time travel plot.
The Terminator did time travel well, I think the first two movies of that franchise really manage to pull it off, because it's just touched upon and then, ""look cool robots from the future"" I guess back to the future works as well, it's never too serious, just a fun movie, but do anything else with time travel and it just turns out rubbish, for me it ruined End Game and made this movie a farce.

Basically, holding conservative values and reading books on our founding fathers leads to a right wing revolt which causes the death of millions of people in an alleged civil war.

303,josephd-18087,Almost 2 hours of nothing happening,4,27 June 2020,"By the very first shot you sort of know what this movie is about. By the second shot you know how it is going to play out. This movie isn't just predictable, it's painfully average. First off this movie doesn't have actual characters, it has charactures. Dutiful cop who neglects family life for work, older jaded cop who keeps the younger, naive cop in check, crazy scientists who spout big sounding words you may remember from 10th grade chemistry. It's really hard to care about these people when they are worse done cardboard cutout movie tropes instead of... you know, humans.So you don't care about the characters, but what about the plot? Well it's predictable down to the scene. You can sit there and go ""he's gonna hug him and steal his wallet"" minutes before it happens. And, without spoiling the ending, it is exactly what you predicted it will be within watching the first 20 minutes. The entire story plays out like you expected it would. And the story is the main character figuring out what you already know. It's just chock full of common tropes done poorly. Like the ""main character found out something crazy but everyone thinks he is crazy"" that you've seen a million times before. Of course there's never any actual tension because you the audience are already 10 steps ahead of our main character and you know he's not crazy.People act irrationally and stupidly. ""Oh this person is good at martial arts it's a good thing I have a gun pointed at them but let me walk as close as possible and oh no look they knocked the gun out of my hand because they know martial arts who would have predicted this?!""I think the most offensive part of this movie though are the themes. The main theme is basically just ""love will save the world"" without any nuance but there are also is some political subtext. Protests against police brutality, riots, white supremacists, talk of civil wars, and books written by America's founding fathers that the camera just lingers on as if begging you to notice. ""Look she's reading a book by Thomas Jefferson. You know him, right? Let's focus the camera on the book so our stupid audience knows it's a book by Thomas Jefferson"". But it doesn't actually say anything.

307,nicholaslance,A time travel movie for people that don't think too hard,5,22 January 2020,"This movie illustrates why time travel does not work. The movie ends with everything magically being fixed, but glosses over the fact that if the time traveler was successful, then it would erase the events that created the need for someone to travel through time to start with. Which in turn would mean the time traveler never traveled back in time, so then the events were never stopped, creating a never ending loop.The loop can be solved by assuming that each jump back in time creates a divergent timeline, meaning that the baby being born at the end of the movie is not the time traveler that goes back in time, but the same person in a different timeline. This film uses the same timeline though, as the physicist's research is prompted by someone using his own invention from the future, which is based on that research. Which would be impossible, because the timeline in which he is prompted in that direction is the divergent timeline, and in the original timeline he would have remained blissfully unaware, and would have never developed the required technology. There are other problems as well with each death creating a divergent timeline, and by killing the people in 1988 it would have removed the need to kill some of the people later, and vice versa, and the time traveler is apparently moving only backwards in time so has no way to verify the targets which would change based on the previous alterations to the timeline.In all it is just a logical mess, that makes no sense, which is probably why the film doesn't delve into the mechanics of the situation.",In the Shadow of the Moon

There are glaring plotholes and the usual inconsistencies that plague most sub-par time travel movies - no biggie here. However, when the motivation of the time traveler gets clearer, this flick takes a sinister turn.The message that hollywood - represented by netflix once more - sends again and again is crystal clear by now. I don't have to spell it out for you, since every single one reading this comment - no matter your political affiliation - knows exactly what I mean. The only question that matters is:
Do you agree? Do you accept the message? Do you suppport the message? Do you propagate it yourself? Or do you resent it? Do you even openly oppose it? The camps of those who are willing to give clear answers, being fully aware of their consequences, grow by the day. And with the size of the camps on both sides of the great divide grows the anger, and the divide itself grows with it.
Imagine if the roles were reversed, would you still support the message?If you'd be the one to shoot an innocent man because you're convinced that he will do evil in the future; if you see your action, and only yours, as the only righteous one; if you commit a crime against humanity to prevent a crime against humanity, you have become the very thing you're trying just so hard to eradicate. If you agree with the message, then you gazed into the abyss for too long, and I've come to tell you that the abyss gazed back into you.I'm sick and tired of the message, and I'm sick and tired of them. Their actions made me care and without their actions I wouldn't have to act. But what can a man do, when he wakes up every day just to find the abyss gazing into him?",In the Shadow of the Moon

In the confused socialist revolutionary fantasy of In the Shadow of the Moon, innocent casualties are acceptable (for the greater good), the butterfly effect only sometimes applies to time travel and killing people who say things you disagree with is ethical.The premise is interesting and the first half of the film is thrilling, before the political objectives of the antagonists are revealed. The audience is from then on burdened with the director's expectation for us to sympathize with self-righteous murderers.The ""bad guys"" the antagonist is killing are an unnatural and ignorant progression of neo-nazis, conspiracy theorists, constitutionalists and everyday white people. The further back in time the antagonist travels, the more normal and unassuming the ""bad guys"" are.
The anti-hero's racially diverse team will stop at nothing to kill any white person who might possibly inspire ideas in the future that ""cause"" the ""the civil war"".Until the last moments of the film I held out hope the lead actor would ""stick to his guns"" and maintain the moral high ground that killing innocent people is wrong to achieve a political goal.
Instead of a rewarding conclusion the film fizzles out as the pathetic hero is converted by the anti-hero.By the conclusion of the film, the ""science"" remains under-explained and there is no hint at any negative future consequence from the killings of both pre-crime victims and innocent casualties.

Like many other reviews said before me, I thought the movie started well. Although I thought that the actors weren't that great, I gave it a chance.
But soon you realize that something isn't quite right. The pace goes off too often and the characters aren't really interesting. There is just not enough suspense building I would say.
But ultimately, the major problem of this movie is that it tries to be something that it can't be: a complexe sci-fi Christopher Nolan style.
It's easy to see how much that movie wants to be or at least ressemble Inception to fall in its category. But the actors and the overall quality of production is just not there. So trying to make a sci-fi movie with these elements just won't get you up there.
The ending was almost laughable. The music with organ (Interstellar) and the profound message...
Sci-fi is not an easy genre to get right and especially when subjects like time-travelling come in play. It's easy to get the plot go in all directions and completely loose sense.

The few gems are hence tough to find between all the broken glass. As a dedicated movie enthusiast, I rarely give any Netflix content over 6. 'In the shadow of the moon' is one of the few that deserves a bit more appraisal.There will be no Oscar nomination for the acting, and the budget has no room for many cool CGI effects, and the plot has some holes here and there (as in most movies). Still, the story and message are worth a thought: how many lives would we be willing to take if we could travel to the past and prevent a disaster in the future? This, for me, translates directly into how many lives are we willing to take today to prevent bad things from happening in the future (Afghanistan, Iraq, etc). How long would we go if we could stop the American Civil War, the Two World Wars, 9-11, etc.?The film doesn't justify mass murder (which I see in many comments) but tries to inspire us to think about this very relevant dilemma.Great movie.",In the Shadow of the Moon

The plot plays with time travel in a refreshing way, enough for you to wonder how they ""designed"" it here.The suspense/mystery ambiance is tense and mesmerizing and it's been a long time since I have been captivated and really involved about a murder investigation in a movie, especially when this investigation contains interesting sci-fi elements.The visuals are good and the action scenes won't impress you, but they are well done.There are however two main issues difficult to forgive. The first one is about the characters. Boyd Holbrook, who plays the main protagonist Thomas Lockart, never makes his interpretation shine and sometimes even conveys...Dullness. You will have difficulties feeling empathy for Lockhart, especially when you are able to witness the struggle, problems and pressure the ""Moon affair"" puts on him. Michael C. Hall is O.K here but unfortunately shamefully underused. The main antagonist, interpreted by Cleopatra Coleman, don't have enough time/backstory that could really help you understand her character's motivations and especially, grasp her determination.The second one is the last part of the movie. It seems all the budget was spent on the first 90 minutes, and you will be able to see all the aforementioned qualities decline towards the end of the film, as well as the mentioned issues increase to finally lead to an unsatisfying and anticlimactic conclusion. ""In the Shadow of the Moon"" ending scenes should have been filmed at the beginning of the production, not at the end, especially for this kind of sci-fi.

People who have committed no crimes whatsoever are sanctioned for execution because they have been found guilty in absentia for holding or sharing an idea? an idea that the future ""good guys"" have decided is so dangerous that they are morally obligated to go on a kill spree through time so as to prevent this idea from ever being allowed to disseminate?, yet this particular dangerous idea is conveniently never fleshed out in anyway so as to allow the viewer to decide for themselves the merits of this harsh judgement, merely vaguely implied to be on the right end of the spectrum so ergo bad.Ill leave the glaring plot holes and paradoxes of the actual story aside and simply say that this movie has some very questionable and disturbing undertones. Its pretty difficult to refute the claim that so many have made that this movie is a rather shamelessly Left Wing partisan propaganda piece. It would be interesting to see the reaction from the same people disavowing or dismissing any kind of Political motive driving this movie if the premise remained exactly the same but the victims and perpetrators were ideologically switched.

I think the way they built the plot and left me wanting answers was really impressive. Especially the in the end with the plot twist.. That really gave the whole movie a nice and warm feeling, while still keeping the same the thiller feeling thats carried the movie. I thought it was quite beautiful.
And I saw people debating over the political aspects of it. I don't think that matters at all, I think what matters is the plot of the movie, not exactly what politics it contains.I think that if they had not given away so much information about the situation and left you thinking more after, it would have been a stronger message, but thats just me.",In the Shadow of the Moon

There are a hell of a lot more offensive movies out there, I am 58 and white and I did not even think of any of the things that some of the overly sensitive reviewers on here so just enjoy it as the fictional movie that it is and not a propaganda movie with messages of hate.",In the Shadow of the Moon

Never watched a trailer, never read a review.Like others have reviewed here, the premise was interesting in the beginning and was compelling enough to keep me going. Then, you see the woman bus driver with the Thomas Jefferson book. From their on you know where it's going.The entire premise of this movie can be summed up like this - ""White people bad.""The ""terrorist"" is a biracial woman from the future who time travels to kill white people who have a different ideology than what's politically acceptable. She wears a blue jacket indicating she's probably a Democrat.All the ""evil"" ideology is written by a white guy who is part of some type of imaginary militia group and distributed through books written by prominent white historical figures like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, etc.It's basically leftist woke garbage and the message is clear.

382,Muhammad,The movie fails on multiple levels,2,14 November 2019,"The story is just terrible. There are so many plot holes that I spent half the time anticipating an answer to them but nothing was explained. At a point you are told that an event in past cannot be changed and then you have the whole future changing because of a change in the past. I am sure the writer(s) realized the issue but thought that the ""Movie Magic"" will cover the flaw. It did NOT.The acting is decent, but the flow is too choppy. I get that you have to move 9 years ahead but still, it could have been done better. The action sequence (bike chase) towards end is laughably bad. Somehow a two truck can keep up with a dirt bike.But all things aside, the worse part of the movie is the message. It is okay to go back in time and kill people if you do not like their actions in present/future. This is a terrible idea. So, we go back and kill Osama bin Ladin or Hilter. What if they develop a time machine, would it be okay to go back and kill Washington, Jefferson or Franklin? How far back can you go? How many people you will have to kill to stop bad things from happening? I totally get that there is no Time Machine and most likely there will never be one but even to entertain an idea like this in theory is dangerous. People!!

Most Netflix and Prime movies last about 15 minutes with me before I turn off in disappointment, boredom or disgust, so it was a pleasure to find one that held me to the end. I liked the concept and found myself intrigued enough to reflect on the ethics of the plan (contrary to what other reviewers have said, the targets were all original conspirators, not associated influences). I enjoyed seeing the cop's life apparently being wasted on a crazy obsession, and I actually didn't guess the killer's identity (must be getting old!)An entertaining movie.

389,r-pineiro24,A mediocre and disturbing piece,4,14 October 2019,"Netflix begins to become a dangerous place, where extreme ideas find their breeding ground. It is like when a terrible bacterium grows in the ideal environment, causing rot, ailments and ailments. Such doctrinal ideas come from an ideological sector that has taken possession of chairs, media and television streaming. Violence in the name of false progressivism, intolerance as a champion of presumed tolerance, has become the official discourse of Western neo-communitarianism, that which has been flourishing gradually and without haste after the collapse of the Berlin wall.Last night I saw a mediocre and disturbing piece (In the Shadow of the Moon) that launches praises to the left-handed fantasy of eliminating any vestige of intellectual resistance. An African-American woman, dressed like any terrorist militant in Antifa, returns from the future to horribly carry out a series of reactionary targets that will be the cause of a civil war almost in the middle of this century. The murders are justified, because they respond to the justice of good. The victims, who die after bleeding from the eyes, noses and mouth (like any disseminated intravascular dissemination) are the vestige of an error that must be corrected at any cost. The anti-interruption, in its stubborn and foolish eagerness to silence its rivals, bets on the propagation of death and violence. How much these representatives of goodness and love would not give to see the monstrous President Trump bleed live and direct! The wet dream of the irrational left begins to find an echo on the Netflix of the Obama family. Hopefully such a thing does not go from being just a mental straw.",In the Shadow of the Moon

And there's a major plot hole related to the time-travel element (but what time-travel work doesn't have contradictions of some sort?), Still, all in all, it was a great film. Very well done, cohesive, well-acted, and a fantastic story. So, if you can suspend disbelief on some of the elements, it's well worth a watch.

The message is clear it's not only OK to kill the people who oppose you, it's OK to kill the ones that inspire them. Travel through time and kill everyone that has an idea different opinion to what you believe. No debating, discussing or plain talking, the course of action is murder, I think Kim Jong Un wt his panties when he watched. It.Smart enough to time travel, but stupid enough not to use a gun. Why instead of injecting poison into people's necks (or shooting them wtf), would someone use that weird remote control poison, what's the difference? And if the signal is from the future, and travels all the way through time how does it know when to act?But the worst part is that it's OK to be a lousy father for 27 years without any consequences if you have a stupid excuse.And one question I have is why was Dexter an a.hole? They just say he is, but everything he did and say was OK, the blond guy just didn't agree with him.

As such, I found the movie's message not to be as much a political one, but a fairly scary reality, the terroristic plot part that is. The time travel aspect was interesting. The family twist decent. The acting well done. My only personal criticism is the movie dragged a little and could have been condensed, but this is often a criticism of mine. A solid 6 for original thought and good acting.

Okay but where is the explanation of time travel. Director should know time travel isnt like a toy you pick it play with it. That's a reason why there is not many time travel movies are made. This topic need precision & devlopment which this movie didnt focus on.
I mean direction is very weak.when someone die u just do not stand there & do just open & close ur eyes that moment ruined emotions which affected character devlopment. At last if u have to show long generation connection you first give clues & background story itself. So when u do plot twist people feel suprised.
I dont know why this movie even exist. It start well then get worst ech 15 min.
Why u made this movie to gave inception & predestination like feeling but here substance is lacking, & when u want to suprise people like the sixth sense & the others u first have to give clues to viewers.
They tried to make time travel mystery like darknetflix involving twists & generation connection but totally fails.

People on here will deny that it's propaganda, but it is. I don't subscribe to left/right Hegelian dialectic stuff, but it's clear from the terminology used in the manifesto that it's a modern anti-conversative film.

No sir or madam, the universe doesn't care about that. Results that lead to the destruction of the earth or minor events happen between are exactly the same for the universe. You can't even change a butterfly's single flap by a single degree by going into past. You might as well bomb the entire universe.The act of going to past changes the past, undoes entropy, breaks all sorts of laws of the universe. Now you might just say ""cool off, man, it's just a sci-fi movie"", but if a movie is using determinism as a tool to justify itself then I can use the term to its true meaning to explain how meaningless it is. I wouldn't call this sci-fi because sci-fi implies probability, this has 0% probability.And to be honest there is no way to justify killing a bad person by going into past, and I sure hope any cop will try to and hopefully succeed to catch you.

426,BeBeBlue7,Enjoyable Thriller Cop Chase,8,18 January 2021,"I liked this movie. It falls in my opinion as a high high ""B"" thriller film, but it was enjoyable. I found the movie almost bordering on a film-noir with a 90s crime movie vibe. The music and the cinematography added to the atmosphere of the story.SPOILERS:What I enjoyed about this movie was the crime-solving obsessed cop-detective who literally gave up on his life to get his ""man"" or in this case his ""woman."" He never gave up even though he fell on hard times, he was determined to solve the crimes.
I'm a sucker for any kind of time-travel story and all of time-travel paradoxes so my review is biased. I'm always curious as to how a filmmaker/screenwriter will address this element in a film.Some people complained about the ending, but the ending was the sucker punch for me. The criminal he's been chasing is his own granddaughter from the future. Her crimes are preventing a scary future from happening by killing the reasons/people for it in the past. It's a provocative thought. Who wouldn't go back to the past to stop Hitler?Not to be political here (though some may interpret it as such but that is not my intent), but in light of recent events in the United States U.S.Capitol on January 6, 2021, I found the future events depicted in the film the antagonist(s) were trying to prevent frightening. Unfortunately, SOME people in the United States do have this same nihilistic burn-it-all-down attitude that was depicted in the film...and that America is only for SOME people...the right people and to hell with everyone else.Is the film watchable? Yes. Focus on the cop trying to solve a crime and you may enjoy it. This is not a SJW film. As someone who dislikes that SJW stuff, I can say that this film is not that by a long shot.",In the Shadow of the Moon
427,rd2922,Good movie worth watching,9,30 September 2019,"First off, some reviewers are a little extreme in criticizing the movie based on the movement which is to be stopped. The movie didn't go into specifics for a reason. And in the end, if any one of us knew our world would be destroyed in our lifetimes with the only chance of salvation being to go back in time and change things, I find it hard to believe that any person would say because they have principles. War and conflict change moral. If you say otherwise you are extremely nieve. The movie follows one man as his life is torn apart because he is obsessed in proving that the tragedy of his life is for a reason. A very human and thing to do. At the end he finds out that not only is it all for a reason but he can actually start over. Maybe the plot is derived from ideas of other films but how many truly original movies can there be these days. The movie shines in character development and the emotional connection to the main character. I think this movie was entirely realistic.
As for the ""contradiction"". While time travel seems to some to be a fluid, easily manipulated endeavor. I understand it to be more linear. Yes the character is attempting to change the future. She made a linear trip backwards in time. Her course at the point of speaking with Locke, cannot be changed. She will only continue to travel backward and will not return home, even though her actions may change events in the future.",In the Shadow of the Moon

It is ok to question it but do people question that much altering past in Terminator. Minority report is movie that question ethics. This is movie that tries to be positive and talks about personal sacrifices. Of course you can talk what is that important event that should to be changed by altering past.

Also, as the film went on, I can't say I was wholly surprised by the conclusion, so it is guilty of being at least somewhat predictable.Overall though, I enjoyed this film and its story and I believe it's worth watching. There are a number of review who accuse this movie of justifying the murder of innocents, or that it's anti-conservative SJW propaganda.

It also brings into the movie a real problem that we are currently facing with the protest that are taking place for BLM.

Even though the movie has an interesting topic, and a not-so-complicated plotline; it fails to be significant. The film cannot follow the one simple rule of cinema: ""show don't tell"". With its entire ending told by a character, I simply don't think it deserves anything more than 4. There are huge plot holes, which I am willing to overlook for the sake of the rating, however; still the movie as a whole somewhat fails to be impressive. It's not something you will remember the plot of a year from now. The fact that the entire message of the movie is only revealed at the end does not make things any better. The acting is nice, but I believe none of the actors have reached their full potential, they are capable of way better acting as we've seen in other productions, as it might be hard to do so with a script like this.

Good actors, nice sets and designs, and it wasn't real fake or anything. Hella Spoiler: the serial killer was actually a terminator-time-traveling granddaughter of the main character. I even kind of picked up on the idea in the beginning that she was killing people on purpose for a purpose. Turns out it was to stop a major civil war in the future. Girl had decided to save 11,000+ people bc some extremists were setting a bomb. Is this morally ambiguous? Well, yeah. It would be like if you could prevent 9/11 or the Holocaust by systematically killing a handful of people and altering the timeline. Does killing a few justify saving thousands or more? That's up to you. Plus it's sci-fi. Y'all watching zombies and aliens and everything else so why get bent out of shape over a few humans offing each other to prevent a war?

Only its not a copycat and after she kills his partner and disappeares. From here it follows him as he chases her through time every 9 years as he loses his job and his family falls apart he investigates connections between the victims eventually figuring out that they are part of a fanatical white supremacist group and he realizes that she is a time traveler moving backwards in time.
When he finally catches her 9 years later to stop her she explains that not only will he not stop her but he is actually the one who trained her and sent her back because she is his granddaughter and he sent her back with the help of a scientist who has also been tracking her actions using the knowledge to guide the research that is used to send her back and kill the people behind a successful revolution to establish a white ethnostate in the United States.Now the film is getting slammed by white supremacists and those sympathetic to their cause because it they are the villains of the film.
Now they won't say that because either they don't want to admit it to others or possibly even themselves.
So instead of looking at the film from the standpoint of the characters they project their guilt, their anger and their guilt onto the film.Because of this they miss a very deep high concept movie that explores complex moral and emotional questions of sacrifice and conviction. What if you could change the past if by killing a few people at the right time you could prevent a catastrophe? Would you? What would you be willing to sacrifice? What if it was your own grandchild?It's not an easy question, which is what makes it a great film and story.",In the Shadow of the Moon

494,Bruno1033,A Movie About Divisive Politics Spawns Divisive Reviews,10,6 October 2019,"First, I know a lot of people say this, but I rarely take the time to review a movie.Initially, my thought was that this movie was an incredibly original time travel movie mashed up with a gritty cop movie. Then I realized just how similar it was to Terminator - which I LOVE.People have complained that this movie is paradoxical. I challenge anyone who has said so to find a time travel movie that isn't.The movie was well acted and written to address one of the key issues facing our times - growing divisiveness. Ultimately, the question the movie addresses (though not explicitly) is the idea of whether you would go back in time to kill Hitler. (Read Stephen King's The Dead Zone for more on this). You will note that the vast majority of the reviews rate this movie as garbage, because the reviewers disagree with the political ideology of the film. And, about all we know of the war that was trying to be stopped in the movie is that it was fueled by white supremacy, so take those reviews and the aggregate rating with a grain of salt.I really enjoyed this and think it is one of the gems of Netflix. See also, The Discovery, Otherlife, and Coherenece. Is there a political message? Sure. Are there paradoxes? Of course. But there is good drama, good action, and good acting. If you like time travel and aren't going to get ruffled by a message against white supremacy, you'll like this movie.",In the Shadow of the Moon

It is unbelievable the idiotically low rating some moral police losers have caused for this film. I can't believe that I almost didn't watch this movie because of the low rating which would have been an utter travesty. So I have given this a solid 10 to make up for their idiocy, otherwise a solid 9 for me at least.

If you liked Twelve Monkeys, Dexter and its ilk then you will LOVE this film. So don't listen to those morality morons, watch the film and decide for yourself please. A 6 rating is absolutely ridiculous and an utter affront to the hard work and solid performances delivered by the cast and crew of ""In the Shadow of the Moon"".

It starts as a detective investigation, then transform into a science fiction/time travel chasing movie and then the real intention of the movie is revealed. The justification on killing people based on ""historical"" events, that in theory, havent even happened yet. The idea that is it ok to kill someone based on the person they will become, is not only absurd, but lacks the humanity that they ""good"" people are trying to save. The fact that the movie doesnt even show other methods that could have been implemented, but fails (encarcelation, arrange aggression/anti-racisim courses, etc) and instead go direct into killing, really show us what it is wrong with this movie and in fact with this world. And it is not the ""ideas"", that people can come out with, but our lack of enthusiasim or willing to debate them, our lack of respect into each other thoughs, the fact that nowdays people have to hide or join together with people that may share same opinions for fear of being call names, just like in the movie, and instead of tackling these issues, and focusings on providing us nicer/healthy solutions, it focuses on the idea that is ok to terminate a person's life because of his/her ideas/thoughs. In other words, it is ok for the goverments to take control of what the people should think or how to act. If not ""acceptable"" for it, then lets kill him/her. The Though Police (1984) in all its glory.The movie is a completly waste of time. I realised the main conection between the main two characters the 2nd time she appeared in the time travel sequence. The only salvageable thing, is the acting of the Boyd Holbrook. Everything else, even the acting of Michael C. Hall (amazing in Dexter) is terrible.
Slow reactions between science fiction scenes where you can see the editing in the scenes. It even lacks coherences in the story. It never shows us how the main character finds out about the ""1st"" real victim. It never even bothers to explain why the scientist fake his own dissaperance, surely he could continue his research and not answer any of the detectives questions, or even how did he figure out that the girl was doing the ""right thing"" and support her in her pursue.For all this and much much more, this movie deserves this review.

The movie logic contradicts itself within 5 minutes and expects the audience not to notice it.First, the time traveler, Rya, tells the main character Thomas that once something happens, it always remains that way and there is no changing it. So since she was killed in 1988, she always will be killed in 1988..Time cannot be changed, and the events will always remain the same. Then, 3 minutes later, it's shown that the apocalypse is reversing and thus never happened. Meaning time is not actually predestined and CAN be changed. So which is it, movie?!Not only that, but this ending created a huge paradox that makes absolutely no sense. Again,the movie logic LITERALLY STATES that time is predetermined, so events will always happen. Rya will always come back to kill people, Thomas will always kill her in the subway in 1988. Which means Rya has to go back to prevent the apocalypse. Which means the apocalypse ALWAYS happens, because she got sent back. There is no stopping it.

That part of the plot feels like an idea straight from the frustrated mind of a 14 years old. Its stupid and vile.However, I love movies and this one vad many plot holes, sloppy written characters and story archs that are so poorly created. Nevertheless, the first half of the flick contained some nice set-pieces and intriguing ideas and got me hooked.

556,ncstebb,Loved it. Deserves to be enjoyed.,9,15 August 2020,"Really well-made atmospheric story of a man whose life is dominated by tragedy. The set up for this is a bit of sci-fi time travel giggery which is always a minefield for those that want to deconstruct it. But, this sets the path to the pivotal moment (spoiler warning) where he is given the opportunity to undo the tragedy, but has to make that decision knowing that he may be condemning many more to much greater tragedy.It's such a complex moment and its power comes from the slow atmospheric build up. I love the time travel aspect of the moment where we are to believe that the decision has already been made. It feels like he could go either way, but the other character in the scene seems to know that it has already happened. The ambiguity here is the nagging question that, surely he could have saved himself (and those he cared for) and still found another way to prevent the greater tragedy, but could you have made that call in the minute or so that he had?This last question is mirrored in the surrounding story where time travel has been used to prevent a tragedy in the future by going back in time and gruesomely killing seemingly innocent people. Surely there were other ways to do it? Perhaps the people who chose this action were fools or perhaps there was some reason that it had to happen this way. In the end as I said, I think this is part of the set up for the more personal story being told. A more accomplished film may have been able to settle this without losing the mystery and atmosphere of this story. But I doubt it.The decision to have a black girl as the time-travelling character is interesting given the times we live in (and the way she died). Perhaps it would have been safer to make that character white? Similarly, the perpetrators of the greater, future tragedy could have been international terrorists. The filmmakers could have chosen Russian, Chinese or Middle Eastern terrorists, depending on which would be more comfortable for the viewers. Would these things have made the movie better?",In the Shadow of the Moon

560,makeqfit-157-624860,Not As Smart as your average Cameron.,4,25 July 2020,"In The Shadow of the Moon is a mouthful of a title and a film which disappears a little up its own grandiose intentions. Taking ideas from The Terminator and Looper and many other time loop films, In The Shadow of the Moon, starts promisingly but, because of the muddied storytelling, comes almost to a stop halfway through.Unlike the aforementioned films, this film suffers from one not knowing what the end goal is trying to achieve or, in this case, avoid. There is mention of a civil war but that would hardly warrant a person travelling back in time to assassinate random people because, in the words of the film, their ideologies and moral compass help to shape the ideas of some person who would cause civil war at some point in the future. What? Exactly.The war or act is only alluded to and only seems to affect Philadelphia, even though the woman says it will end the world. Seeing as she has come from the future, meaning the world had not ended, what the heck was that supposed to mean? We do not get to know the people who are killed, nor meet the person or persons they supposedly influence.There is some vague allusion to Jefferson - admittedly, not being an American, I have very little idea what this has to do with proceedings. - and some oblique references to extremism but that is as far as it goes when it comes to a reason for the shenanigans going on in this film.The acting is fine from all concerned and is directed by Jim Mickle, for the most part, quite well. The dialogue in the script is not bad and sounds natural, though there is the wretched, dreaded, exposition scene with Rao and Locke towards the end when they try to explain the films quite convoluted premise.Written by Gregory Weidman and Geoffrey Tock, it is the story that this film falls down on. At just under two hours long, In TheShadow of the Moon - there are so many better, catchier, titles they could have come up with - is ultimately let down by the too-smart-for-its-own-good plot which brings an initially gripping thriller to a grinding, laborious trudge midway through proceedings. In The Shadow of the Moon is not an unwatchable mess but you will be underwhelmed if you take a couple of hours out of your day to watch it.",In the Shadow of the Moon

563,zavichij,Both a mystery and a political philosophy,7,1 October 2019,"The first thing that hits me is the paradox in time-travel, you can't change what happens if it already happened, because if it doesn't happen you never have a need to change anything.The next thing is at the end part of the movie it tramples on many feelings, because it paint the world in black and white and take sides. The movie also tells us that it should be a good thing if we could go back and kill people that have the wrong opinions.If the narrator or filmmaker wants the public to think that its good to stop in the movie case patriots from having ideas that could evolve into a future civil-war, it creates a problem.I quote Benjamin Franklin:""Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety.""
You can't have both liberty and safety against ""wrong"" political ideas, its either democracy or dictatorship.If the narrator or filmmaker didn't have any political ulterior motive, then it probably wants us to think it through how we want to shape our future.
Because of the time-travel paradox, we can't go back and change things if they already happened.So overall the movie is good, its has a good trilling chase the bigger part of the movie and then ending it with these thoughts that make us question what kind of future we really want.",In the Shadow of the Moon

serial killer=good because this uprising is bad!this movie underscores how a community in Hollywood can justify Hatred, Death, Fear & Terror; creating a fictional work that justifies not just the elimination of the writings of an idea- but of course the mass killings of all who support that idea in its infancy- leading via the space time continuum to the ""Books disappearing as they were never written"" which means the civil war of 2024 never happens""and of course the perpetrator of this terrible event isn't an eco terrorist, a radial group such as isis or even a underground collection of modern era Nazis such as in ""Sum of all Fears"" but rather- white southern men/woman who seek to ""take their country back"" and by the way do quite a lot of coke, prey on red necks and in a nice little twist- couch their ideas in the books and teachings of the founding fathers.",In the Shadow of the Moon

Almost every aspect was a let down. Plot holes, pacing, score, continuity errors, bad science, terrible political agenda. I was even unimpressed by the acting?
Especially as the movie wore on, they barely attempted to age the characters. Boyd Holbrook as Locke was already in his late 30s when this movie was made, and the best they could do to age him up 27 years was to give him a hobo beard and scraggly hair? Nope.

As per the course with all regressive liberal movies conservatism, the founding fathers, freedom of thought and love of country are the enemy's . No doubt this movie was written by card carrying ANTIFA acolyte as it justifies violence and mass murder as means of achieving the objective of world transformation. Ironically, this movie and those like it are having the opposite effect of what it obviously intended, that of winning hearts of minds. Instead, it illuminates and validates the leftist agenda and their subversion within all aspects of media.

That's weird because:
1.) For the assassin, the people HAVE already killed thousands. (Did you actually watch the movie?)
